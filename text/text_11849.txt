BACKGROUND
transcription-induced chimerism, resulting from the transcription and intergenic splicing of two consecutive genes, was previously thought to be a rare event in mammals. recent studies, however, incorporating systematic in silico analyses of ests and cdnas in the ncbi databases, conclude that as much as 5% of the human transcriptome is comprised of chimeric sequences  <cit> . these fusion transcripts are generated from tandem genes that are physically located within ~ <dig> kb of each other, the median distance being ~ <dig>  kb  <cit> . although transcription-induced chimeras can function to  expand functional protein diversity,  alter transcriptional regulation,  inhibit transcription of the two participating genes, or  inhibit transcription of putative functional intergenic sequences , the mechanism regulating its occurrence remains elusive  <cit> .

rbm <dig>   was first identified by positional cloning from a small cell lung carcinoma homozygous deletion region at the 3p <dig>  tumour suppressor locus  <cit> , and, in parallel, as a differentially expressed transcript during granulocyte differentiation  <cit> . the gene covers ~ <dig> kilobases  and has  <dig> exons. rbm <dig> is immediately adjacent to, telomeric to, and  <dig> kb from, the rbm <dig> gene. while the rbm <dig> gene has been shown to be either deleted or disrupted in some lung cancers  <cit> , rbm <dig> mrna was recently found to be significantly upregulated in breast cancer  <cit> . in addition, the rbm <dig> protein was first isolated in an autologous antibody screen from a patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung, demonstrating an association between elevated levels of rbm <dig> protein and cancer  <cit> . of significance to the work reported herein, a novel trans-fusion protein incorporating the amino-terminal region of rbm <dig>  with the carboxy-terminal region of colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor  was recently reported in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia  <cit> .

rbm <dig> pre-mrna is alternatively spliced to produce at least five variants  <cit> . rbm6a, b, c and d differ only in relation to which alternate sequence from intron  <dig> is incorporated between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  a fifth splice variant, rbm6Δ <dig>  is identical to the predominant transcript, rbm6a, but lacks exon  <dig>  timmer and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that expression of this rbm6Δ <dig> transcript was much higher in normal lung tissue than in lung cancer tissues, suggesting that removal of exon  <dig>  which contains one of two consensus rna recognition motif  domains within the protein, is important for tumour suppression. it was recently reported that expression of either rbm <dig> or rbm6Δ <dig> mrna and rbm10v <dig> mrna , was downregulated and highly correlated in relation to a number of clinicopathologic parameters normally associated with poor breast cancer prognosis, suggesting that the coordinated expression, and/or alternative splicing, of rbm <dig> and rbm10v <dig> is an important aspect of breast tumorigenesis  <cit> .

the rbm <dig> /luca-15/h <dig> gene covers approximately  <dig> kb of genomic dna and has  <dig> exons. rbm <dig>  generates at least four rna splice variants, rbm <dig>  rbm5Δ <dig>  rbm5+ <dig> and rbm5+5+ <dig>  <cit> . all of these transcripts are ubiquitously expressed, albeit to differing levels, in normal tissues. expression of rbm <dig> mrna is downregulated in tumour tissue compared to normal tissue  <cit> , although our recent study reports that expression of rbm <dig> mrna is marginally upregulated  and protein is significantly upregulated  in breast tumour tissue  <cit> . numerous functions have been ascribed to rbm <dig> gene products, including tumor suppression  <cit> , apoptosis modulation  <cit> , cell cycle regulation  <cit>  and rna binding  <cit> , however, the mechanism of action of the full-length rbm <dig> protein is only just beginning to be delineated  <cit> .

in the study described herein, we set out to investigate the existence of an rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcript whose expression, or protein product, regulated expression of rbm <dig> and rbm <dig>  here we report the unexpected identification of not one but three novel non-coding rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric mrna transcripts, which were differentially expressed in tumour versus non-tumour tissue and whose expression was not associated with decreased rbm <dig> or rbm <dig> mrna expression levels.

RESULTS
identification of three novel rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcripts
rbm <dig> and rbm <dig> map to the short arm of human chromosome  <dig> and are separated by ~ <dig> kb . since transcription-induced chimeras can be generated from genes which are physically located up to  <dig> kb from each other , we decided to investigate the existence of such a chimeric transcript from this locus. nested pcr was performed on cdna generated from total rna from the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line mda-mb- <dig>  the outer nested primers were located within exon  <dig> of rbm <dig> and exon  <dig> of rbm <dig>  and the inner nested primers were located within exon  <dig> of rbm <dig> and exon  <dig> of rbm <dig>  in order to eliminate artifacts from template switching events , thermostable reverse transcriptase was used  <cit> . an ~ <dig> base-pair  amplicon was observed , which sequencing revealed lacked exons  <dig> and  <dig> of rbm <dig> and exon  <dig> of rbm <dig> .

having determined, by nested rt-pcr, that an rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcript did exist, we then focused on obtaining a full-length open reading frame. since during the course of our investigations we found that the amplicon was expressed most highly in the human jurkat t lymphoblastic leukemia cell line and in human skeletal muscle tumour tissue, we used total rna from jurkat cells and skeletal muscle tumour as templates. outer nested primers specific for exon  <dig> of rbm <dig> and exon  <dig> of rbm <dig> were used in combination with inner nested primers specific to exon  <dig> of rbm <dig> and exon  <dig> of rbm <dig>  the experiment was repeated several times. two different amplicons were identified in the jurkat cells , while a third unique amplicon was identified in the skeletal muscle tumour . all amplicons were sequenced. the different transcripts were termed rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcript  <dig> , rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcript  <dig>  and rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcript  <dig> . the common characteristic of all three chimeric transcripts was a lack of exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of rbm  <dig>  and exon  <dig> of rbm <dig>  the difference between all three chimeric transcripts related to the presence or absence of exons  <dig> and  <dig> and a  <dig> nt insertion from rbm <dig> intron 10: chimeric transcript  <dig> lacked rbm <dig> exons  <dig> to 6; chimeric transcript  <dig> lacked rbm <dig> exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  and included the additional  <dig> nt from rbm <dig> intron  <dig>  and; chimeric transcript  <dig> only lacked rbm <dig> exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> .

differential expression of the rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcripts in non-tumour and tumour tissue
to this point, rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric expression was observed in the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line mda-mb- <dig>  t lymphoblastic leukemia jurkat cell line and skeletal muscle tumour, all representing malignant cancers. we therefore decided to investigate the relationship between rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric expression and malignancy by examining expression in non-malignant tissue.

nested pcr was carried out in various tissues, including non-tumour and tumour, using the same primers as mentioned above to identify the ~ <dig> bp amplicon.  interestingly, chimeric expression was never observed in non-tumour tissue samples. in addition, expression was not consistently observed in all tumour tissue types: expression was observed in lung, ovary, skeletal muscle, lymph node, pancreas and breast but not in skin, spleen, uterus, bone, brain, prostate or testis tumour tissue . numerous cancer cell lines were also examined for expression of the chimeric transcripts, including breast , hematopoietic , lung , skin  and cervical . glc <dig> is a small cell lung cancer cell line known to harbour a  <dig> kb homozygous deletion at 3p <dig>   <cit> , and was therefore selected as a negative control for rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcript detection. nested rt-pcr results indicated that rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcription occurred in all cancer cell lines, irrespective of tissue of origin, excluding the glc <dig> negative control.

further analysis of rbm6-rbm <dig> transcription-induced chimeric expression in tumour samples revealed that expression in the tumour tissue was not solely dependent on either tumour type or tissue type . for instance, two different large cell lung carcinomas had different chimeric profiles, demonstrating not only that not all lung tumours are positive for chimeric expression, but that not all lung tumours of the same type , are positive. likewise for the malignant fibrous histiocytoma of skeletal muscle, non-hodgkin's lymphoma, insulinoma of the pancreas and cystadenoma of the ovary. these results suggest that some additional factor, such as tumour grade or differentiation status, plays a role in rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric expression. unfortunately, insufficient pathological information was available for the lung, ovarian, skeletal muscle, lymph or pancreatic tumours to evaluate possible criteria which might account for expression differences. fortunately, the breast tumour samples were provided with more pathological information . there were no apparent expression differences related to grade, lymph node involvement, estrogen or progesterone receptor status, her <dig> status or donor age; however, there appeared to be a threshold tumour size after which rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcript expression was detectable . all three chimeric transcript expressing breast tumour samples  were the largest in our five-sample cohort . the sample with inconsistent chimeric transcript expression was  <dig>  cm in its largest dimension, and the chimeric transcript negative tumour was  <dig>  cm in its largest dimension. this observation suggests that tumour size, as a measure of breast tumour differentiation status, may be an important parameter of rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric expression. a larger sample size, however, is required to confirm this hypothesis.

protein analysis of the rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcripts
while evidence points to the fact that transcription-induced chimerism occurs quite frequently in the human genome  <cit> , only a few fusion proteins have actually been identified, only a portion of which have a known function  <cit> .

sequence analysis of the three chimeric transcripts revealed the longest orf initiating, for each, within exon  <dig> of rbm <dig> but terminating at different premature termination codons  in each of the three transcripts . in chimeric transcript  <dig>  the ptc occurred within exon  <dig> of rbm <dig>  resulting in a putatively ~ <dig> kda chimeric protein of  <dig> amino acids , in frame with rbm <dig> but including an additional four aa from rbm5: the 5'-untranslated region  was  <dig> nt long. chimeric transcripts  <dig> and  <dig> both contained ptcs situated in rbm <dig>  putatively encoding two novel, truncated rbm <dig> proteins. the presence of the intron  <dig> insertion in chimeric transcript  <dig> created a ptc located within exon  <dig> of rbm <dig>  generating an orf of  <dig> aa, putatively encoding an ~ <dig> kda protein with high homology to rbm <dig> but with six novel, additional aa from the  <dig> nt insertion. chimeric transcript  <dig> contained a point mutation in exon  <dig>  generating a ptc and thus resulting in an orf putatively encoding an ~ <dig> kda protein of  <dig> aa. the 5'-utr of chimeric transcripts  <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig> nt. significantly, the presence of long 5'-utrs  and premature termination codons in each of these long orfs, and the lack of a kozak sequence surrounding the exon  <dig> atg codon  <cit>  suggested that either translation initiation would be inhibited or the chimeric transcripts would be degraded by nonsense-mediated decay  <cit> . if translation initiated within rbm <dig> exon  <dig> for each of the chimeric transcripts, thereby utilizing the partial kozak sequence-associated translation initiation codon for rbm <dig> protein, premature termination would occur in all three transcripts. in chimeric transcript  <dig> the ptc would occur within rbm <dig> exon  <dig>  resulting in a putatively ~ <dig> kda protein of  <dig> aa. in chimeric transcripts  <dig> and  <dig> the ptcs would occur within rbm <dig> exon  <dig>  resulting in a putatively ~ <dig> kda protein of  <dig> aa. since premature termination codons were noted for all of the above described open reading frames, we postulated that no protein product, particularly no rbm6-rbm <dig> "fusion" protein, would actually be encoded by these novel chimeric transcripts.

to investigate this, we examined protein production from each of the chimeric transcripts. since the mrna expression levels were relatively low , an in vitro transcription/translation system was used rather than an immunoblot technique. chimeric cdnas were first cloned into the pcr®ii topo® vector, then incubated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate with radioactive methionine. as shown in figure  <dig>  no polypeptide products were observed for any of the chimeric transcripts, from either orientation. positive controls included pcdna <dig> rbm <dig> for the t7-specific reaction, producing the expected product of ~ <dig> kda , and the antisense pcdna <dig> rbm <dig> construct for the sp6-specific reaction, producing the expected ~ <dig> kda major product. these results suggested that the rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcripts are non-coding mrnas.

rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcript expression in relation to rbm <dig> and rbm5
since no rbm6-rbm <dig> protein product was observed, it was tempting to speculate that either  the novel chimeric transcripts function at the mrna level, or  the chimeric rna's are "non-functional", but the physical act of chimeric transcription functions to inhibit, or at least downregulate, expression of the two individual genes, rbm <dig> and rbm <dig>  we therefore initiated our investigation by examining the relationship between expression of rbm <dig> and rbm <dig> in tumour samples that were either chimeric positive or negative. if rbm6-rbm <dig> non-coding mrnas are indeed non-functional, and the physical act of chimeric expression is involved in the regulation of rbm <dig> and/or rbm <dig> expression, then expression of both genes in the chimeric positive tumours would be expected to decrease in relation to the chimeric negative tumours. if, however, rbm6-rbm <dig> non-coding mrnas are indeed functional, then the expected outcome on rbm <dig> and/or rbm <dig> expression would be less predictable.

sybr green based quantitative pcr  technology was used in the analyses. since lack of exon  <dig> was uniquely associated with the rbm6-rbm <dig> transcription-induced chimeras , exon 3-specific primers were used to differentiate between non-chimeric and chimeric rbm <dig> transcripts. likewise, rbm <dig> exon 1-specific primers were used to differentiate between non-chimeric and chimeric rbm <dig> transcripts. two paired skeletal muscle samples were chosen, one that expressed the chimeric transcripts and one that did not. two breast tumour tissue samples were also chosen, one that expressed the chimeric transcripts  and one that did not. commercial normal breast cdna was used for normalization.

interestingly, the results showed that elevated levels of chimeric transcript were in fact associated with elevated levels of rbm <dig> and rbm <dig>  rbm <dig> was highly expressed in the chimeric positive skeletal muscle tumour compared to the chimeric negative skeletal muscle tumour. the raw data are presented as table  <dig>  showing an ~ <dig> -fold increase of rbm <dig> mrna expression levels in the chimeric negative tumour sample , but an ~14-fold increase of rbm <dig> in the chimeric positive tumour sample . a similar trend was observed in the breast tissues , supporting an expression correlation between rbm <dig> expression and that of the rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeras, and demonstrating that the phenomenon was not tissue-specific.

 : chimeric transcript positive,  : chimeric transcript negative.

one interpretation of the observation of a positive correlation between rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric expression and rbm <dig> expression is that chimeric expression represents a small fraction of tumour-associated aberrant "run-off" or "leakage" rbm <dig> transcription events  <cit> . if this were the case, one might still expect to see a decrease in rbm <dig> mrna expression, since the promoter of rbm <dig> is inoperable due to chimera-associated splicing. as shown in table  <dig>  however, rbm <dig> mrna expression levels, in breast tissue, were found to be higher in chimeric positive tumours than chimeric negative tumours, further suggesting that the process of transcription-induced chimerism at this locus is not responsible for repressing expression of either of the two putative tumour suppressor genes rbm <dig> and rbm <dig>  it is therefore hypothesized that the three novel rbm6-rbm <dig> transcription-induced chimeras are functional non-coding rnas, whose role is not one of rbm <dig> and/or rbm <dig> transcription regulation.

 : chimeric transcript positive,  : chimeric transcript negative.

discussion
we previously reported that rbm <dig> mrna expression was significantly upregulated in human breast tumour tissue compared to non-tumour tissue  <cit> . here we report that rbm <dig> mrna expression was also elevated in skeletal muscle tumour tissue compared to normal, from ~ <dig> -fold in one tumour to ~14-fold in a different tumour. the larger increase in rbm <dig> expression levels was associated with the expression of three novel rbm6-rbm <dig> transcription-induced chimeras, each lacking exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of rbm <dig> and exon  <dig> of rbm <dig>  but differing in the presence or absence of exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> and a  <dig> nt sequence from intron  <dig> of rbm <dig>  all three transcripts incorporated the canonical splice sites from both genes . according to akiva and colleagues  <cit> , the most abundant transcription-induced chimeric splicing pattern, occurring in  <dig> % of the events, removes any exon of the upstream gene and the first exon of the downstream gene. each of the three novel rbm6-rbm <dig> transcription-induced chimeras falls within this category, and is, therefore, not a rare form of "chimerism".

the rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcripts appear to be differentially expressed in tumour compared to non-tumour samples. while no expression was detected in non-tumour samples, chimeric transcripts were observed in carcinoma  and sarcoma  samples. the differential chimeric expression patterns observed in tumours of the same tissue type, for instance non-hodgkin's versus t cell hodgkin's lymphoma or large cell versus squamous cell lung carcinoma, may not reflect tumour cell origin-specific expression patterns so much as the differentiation status of that individual tumour sample. this hypothesis is supported by our observations in the breast tumour samples, where chimeric expression appeared to be associated with a threshold tumour size.

for the three novel rbm6-rbm <dig> transcription-induced chimeric transcripts identified, it was interesting to note that each was generated by differential splicing of exons incorporating putative functional consensus sequences, e.g., the novel 20-repeat hexamer sequence within exon  <dig> , the rna recognition motif  within exon  <dig> , and the g-patch domain associated with exon  <dig> . in addition, differential splicing within rbm <dig> intron  <dig> in chimeric transcript  <dig> resulted in elimination of the second rbm <dig> rrm domain within exon  <dig>  it was therefore interesting to speculate that the transcription-induced chimerism at the rbm <dig> locus was important to the generation of novel functional rbm6-related proteins with different mechanisms of action; however, no novel fusion protein was generated and there was no reduction in either rbm <dig> or rbm <dig> mrna expression levels associated with rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric expression. the consistent splicing patterns associated with the chimeras, all revolving around exons containing putatively significant functional domains, suggests that chimerism at this site, or at least altered expression of rbm <dig> and perhaps rbm <dig>  is an important and regulated event. the importance of rbm <dig> tumour-associated expression regulation remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
transcription-induced chimeras of the neighboring genes rbm <dig> and rbm <dig> were identified in human tumour tissues. no novel fusion proteins were encoded by any of the rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeras, but chimeric expression was positively correlated with expression of rbm <dig> and rbm <dig> mrna. the functional significance and regulation of this event remain to be elucidated; however, rbm6-rbm <dig> chimeric transcripts could prove to be useful tumour differentiation markers, although more extensive expression analyses are required to confirm these observations.
