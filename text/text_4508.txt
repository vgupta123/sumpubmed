BACKGROUND
genetic susceptibility is thought to play a role in common diseases including those affecting the colon such as inflammatory bowel diseases  and colorectal cancer . indeed, genome-wide association studies , conducted primarily in populations of european descent, have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with ibd, including both ulcerative colitis   <cit>  and crohn’s disease   <cit> , as well as crc  <cit> . as is the case for gwas variants in general, a number of these variants are located in gene deserts and their functional roles in disease pathogenesis are largely unknown  <cit> . unraveling the functional basis of complex diseases is a priority as this has implications for understanding disease pathogenesis as well as identifying novel therapeutic targets  <cit> .

studying the genetics of gene expression is a tool that can help elucidate the functional consequences of gwas variants. expression quantitative trait loci  mapping associates genome-wide snps with mrna expression from the same individuals in a particular tissue to identify regulatory variation  <cit> . previous studies  <cit>  have detected eqtl in modest sample sizes . these studies have provided important insights into the architecture of gene regulation in general  <cit> , as well as across populations  <cit>  and tissues  <cit> . importantly, it has been shown that variants identified by gwas as reproducibly associated with complex traits are enriched for eqtl in various cell types  <cit> .

while eqtl mapping studies have been performed in lymphoblastoid cell lines   <cit> , liver  <cit> , adipose tissue  <cit> , brain  <cit> , skin  <cit>  and ileum  <cit> , these tissue types may not be relevant for all disease traits. a recent eqtl mapping study in the human ileum noted tissue-specific effects as well as enrichment for ibd susceptibility variants  <cit> . more recently, closa et al. conducted an eqtl analysis of crc loci in colonic mucosa and found significant cis-eqtl in three loci  <cit> . however, comprehensive genome-wide eqtl mapping has not previously been performed in the human colon, which is the relevant tissue for colonic diseases like ibd and crc.

the goal of the present study was to comprehensively map eqtl in healthy human colon in order to characterize colon-specific gene regulation and evaluate its relevance for gwas of ibd and crc as well as other complex phenotypes. towards this end, genome-wide genotyping, using a microarray optimized for individuals of african descent, and gene expression profiling were performed colonic tissue obtained from  <dig> african american  healthy subjects who underwent screening colonoscopies. these findings and resources will allow for improved understanding of disease pathogenesis of inflammatory and malignant diseases of the colon.

RESULTS
in order to identify significant colon eqtl, the genotype and expression data was first subjected to a number of quality controls. using the cleaned data, cis- and trans-eqtl were identified. the overlap between colon eqtl and disease-associated gwas snps was performed as well as the overlap with eqtl in other tissue types. as only aa were used in this study, population differentiated eqtl were also identified. finally, using simulations, enrichment of colon eqtl among ibd- and crc-associated variants and for histone marks was performed. results for these analyses are presented in this order in the sections that follow.

quality control of genotype and expression data
 <dig>  million snps were genotyped in  <dig> aa subjects using the affymetrix axiom pan-african array . snps were removed if they had a genotyping rate <95% , minor allele frequency  <  <dig>  , significant hardy-weinberg equilibrium  p-values , non-autosomal snps , or mapped to the same position  as another snp. imputation was performed using  <dig>  million remaining snps and the  <dig> genomes project reference panel phase i integrated variant set release , which provided a final dataset of  <dig>  million snps, after removing imputed snps with maf <  <dig>  or low imputation quality  . principal components analysis  showed that subjects included in this study were similar to individuals of african ancestry in southwest usa  hapmap population samples in terms of ancestry . the proportion of european and african ancestry among the subjects were represented by the first principal component ; pc <dig> was thus used as a covariate in the eqtl analyses to control for global ancestry.figure  <dig>

in gene expression analysis,  <dig>  probes were profiled. a total of  <dig>  probes remained for analysis after removing probes that mapped to more than one genomic location , that contained one or more snp , or that was not expressed in one or more subjects . heat map visualization and hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data suggested the removal of eight outliers, leaving  <dig> individuals . inclusion of the first five pcs of the gene expression data yielded the maximal number of significant cis-eqtl probes at various false discovery rate  thresholds . these expression-based pcs were included as covariates in subsequent eqtl analysis to correct for unmeasured yet systematic variation in gene expression levels.

identification of colon eqtl
eqtl were identified by testing for an association between each snp and each gene’s expression probe. the distribution of eqtl p-values was compared against the distribution expected by chance separately for cis- and trans-eqtl. for cis-, but not trans-eqtl, we found a significant enrichment for small p-values . we identified  <dig>  cis-eqtl corresponding to  <dig> genes at a fdr of  <dig> , which represent  <dig> independent snp-gene associations . cis-eqtl were found to be highly enriched around transcription start sites  with no discernible trend toward 3′ or 5′ .table  <dig>

overlap of cis-eqtl with colonic disease-associated gwas variants
the national human genome research institute  gwas catalog was searched to identify ibd - and crc-associated gwas variants that are also significant cis-eqtl at fdr <  <dig>  in the colon samples. of  <dig>  significant cis-eqtl at this threshold,  <dig> were previously identified in gwas of ibd , cd only, uc only or crc. when snps in high linkage disequilibrium   with the gwas variants were included, the overlap between gwas signals and significant cis-eqtl increased to  <dig> variants:  <dig> common to cd and uc,  <dig> for uc-only and  <dig> for crc. these significant cis-eqtl corresponded to  <dig> unique target genes that co-localize with disease-associated snps .figure  <dig>

comparison of colon cis-eqtl with other tissues
a comparative analysis was performed to assess the extent of overlap between colon cis-eqtl and cis-eqtl for other tissue types . substantial percentages of colon cis-eqtl target genes were found to be cis-eqtl target genes in other tissues, including genes in lcls, liver, brain, skin, and ileum. as the fdr threshold for defining cis-eqtl in the colon became more stringent, the percentage overlap of colon cis-eqtl target genes with cis-eqtl target genes from other tissues increased.table  <dig>

population differentiated colon cis-eqtl
fixation index  values were calculated between  <dig> genomes project european  and african  populations for all significant colon cis-eqtl . out of the  <dig>  significant cis-eqtl snps, fst estimates were successfully calculated for  <dig>  snps.  <dig>  cis-eqtl  had fst >  <dig> , indicating high population differentiation  which was greater than that expected under the null at all fdr thresholds tested . population differentiated snps that are also associated with cd, uc and crc were identified among colon cis-eqtl using the fst statistic. as the mean value of fst between ceu and yri has been estimated to be  <dig>  across  <dig> genomes project snps  <cit> , fst threshold of  <dig>  was used to define snps as population differentiated. for uc, there was one disease-associated snp rs <dig> with fst >  <dig>  . for cd- and crc-associated snps, there were no gwas variants with fst >  <dig> .figure  <dig>

in order to determine whether enrichment of colon eqtl is specific to particular complex traits or diseases, enrichment analysis was performed for snps associated with autoimmune disorders , cancers , lipid traits , body mass index , type  <dig> diabetes , and psychiatric disorders . there was statistically significant colon cis-eqtl enrichment among snps associated with t2d  and suggestive enrichment among snps associated with bmi  . snps associated with the other traits did not show enrichment for colon eqtl .

enrichment of histone marks in colon cis-eqtl
simulations were conducted to test whether snps overlapping with activating  and repressing  histone mark peaks were statistically enriched among cis-eqtl at an fdr of  <dig>  . significant enrichment of active histone marks was noted among significant cis-eqtl with the following empirical p-values: <  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  . there was no significant enrichment for the repressive histone mark h3k9me <dig> among cis-eqtl  . a similar pattern of significant enrichment of active histone marks but not repressive histone marks among colon cis-eqtl was detected in colonic smooth muscle, adipose nuclei, adult liver, and breast myoepithelial cells . in human crc adenocarcinoma cell line , there was enrichment for h3k4me <dig>  and a suggestive enrichment for h3k36me <dig> , but no significant enrichment for the repressing mark h3k27me <dig>  . taken together, these analyses show that colon cis-eqtl are enriched for active histone marks in several tissue types including malignant crc cell lines.figure  <dig>

discussion
gene expression in a disease-relevant tissue is a powerful intermediate phenotype that could help elucidate the functional basis of some risk-associated variants identified in gwas. gene expression analysis is especially important as disease-associated variants are enriched in non-coding regions  <cit> . the analysis of published gwas variants associated with colonic diseases noted significant enrichment for cis-eqtl in ibd  as well as crc. novel target genes for ibd-associated variants were identified and several previously reported eqtl identified in other tissues were validated. moreover, overlap of colon eqtl in other tissue types, most notably ileum and liver was noted. colon cis-eqtl were located near tss as well as enriched for active histone marks and variants with high population differentiation, results that underscore the functional role of eqtl in gene regulation. this analysis could provide insights into the functional consequences of disease-associated genetic variants.

among ibd-associated gwas snps, variants were associated with differences in the expression of endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase  <dig>  and scm-like with four mbt domains  <dig>  , similar to results in an eqtl mapping study of the human ileum  <cit> . erap <dig> encodes an endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase responsible for major histocompatibility complex class i  ligand trimming  <cit>  that has in silico support as a functional variant in cd  <cit> . sfmbt <dig> is a polycomb protein with transcriptional repressor activity  <cit>  that may regulate a number of genes through epigenetic mechanisms. additional snps for ibd-associated variants identified in this study and their gene targets—rs <dig> with adenylate cyclase , rs <dig> with inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase , rs <dig> with ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme  <dig> , and rs <dig> with neuroexophilin and pc-esterase domain family member  <dig>  and with rna exonuclease  <dig>  —were novel targets and should be validated in a larger study.

among crc-associated gwas snps, rs <dig>  was found to be a cis-eqtl in the colon  <cit> , a finding that was also recently reported by another study  <cit> . the target transcript c11orf <dig> corresponds to an uncharacterized gene known as colorectal cancer associated  <dig> . a study found that two functional risk variants , which are in perfect ld with rs <dig>  lead to decreased expression of c11orf <dig>  <cit> . these results were similar to our finding that the c allele of rs <dig> also results in decreased expression. while this variant was first identified in individuals of european descent, a previous study by our group validated this snp as associated with rectal cancer in aa  <cit> , though other groups have not found evidence for an association of rs <dig> with crc in aa  <cit> . a recent trans-ethnic gwas identified an additional snp  as associated with crc in aa, independent of rs <dig>  that has not been replicated in other populations  <cit> . neither rs <dig>  nor any snps in ld with it, was identified as a colon cis-eqtl in the present study.

enrichment of colon cis-eqtl among trait-associated variants as shown in table  <dig> is consistent with other studies  <cit>  and adds further evidence for the usefulness of eqtl in improving power to detect significant associations from gwas. enrichment of colon cis-eqtl was observed in diseases with colonic involvement , as well as in t2d and bmi. these results raise the intriguing hypothesis that gene expression in the colon could be functionally linked to diabetes and bmi, though further work is needed to identify specific mechanisms. no significant enrichment was found for colon cis-eqtl among variants associated with autoimmune disorders, cancer or psychiatric disorders. taken together, these results support the conclusion that eqtl most relevant to disease show clear tissue specificity, highlighting the importance of creating comprehensive eqtl catalogs in diverse tissue types  <cit> .

a substantial proportion of the gene targets of the significant colon cis-eqtl were also found to be cis-regulated target genes in other tissue types notably liver and ileum – two tissues closely related to the colon . the percentage overlap of cis-eqtl target genes between colon and other tissue types was higher at more stringent fdr thresholds for cis-eqtl associations, which was expected because increased stringency should filter out false positive results. the number of significant target genes shared between studies will also be affected by sample size, significance thresholds and genotyping platforms. therefore, the actual percentage values of overlap should be regarded as rough estimates of the actual extent of overlap. the high cross-tissue replicability of the colon cis-eqtl is consistent with the observation here of active histone mark enrichment in non-colon tissue types as well as findings from other studies that showed that a large number of cis-eqtl are shared across tissues  <cit> . the extent to which eqtl have cell-type or context-specificity in the human colon remains to be investigated but could yield important information for further functional characterization.

consistent with the hypothesis that eqtl have regulatory functions, enrichment was noted for colon cis-eqtl near tss similar to findings in other tissues  <cit> . moreover, cis-eqtl were significantly enriched for histone marks associated with active chromatin  but not with transcriptionally inactive chromatin  in various tissues and in a crc cell line. these findings are consistent with the widely accepted theory that cis-eqtl act by affecting transcript stability or the rate of transcript degradation  <cit> , and other studies that have also noted enrichment of eqtl among activating cis-elements but not in regions of repressed chromatin  <cit> .

a substantial proportion of colon cis-eqtl in this study were highly differentiated between european and african populations  as shown in figure  <dig>  the degree of population differentiation among these eqtl suggests that they may well reflect local adaptation to environment. a similar finding was previously described for lcl eqtl  <cit> . it remains to be investigated whether such colon eqtl, which exhibit large allele frequency differences between european and african populations, contribute to inter-ethnic gene expression differences in the colon that translate into differences in disease risk. integration of gwas results with population genetic approaches may prove instrumental in understanding the genetic basis of differences in ibd and crc risk between europeans and aa  <cit> .

a limitation of this study is the moderate sample size, which reduces power to detect significant eqtl associations , thereby resulting in a high false negative rate. further investigation in a larger cohort is likely to result in more significant eqtl associations, and is warranted to confirm findings from this study. another caveat of this study is that the gwas snps used in the analyses were identified in europeans, whereas the eqtl were identified in aa. although many of the variants identified through gwas in european populations generalize to other populations, there are differences in genetic susceptibility between populations, due to several factors including epistasis, gene-environment interactions, population-specific polymorphisms and differential ld patterns  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that there are differences in genetic associations between european and aa populations. as ibd and crc gwas in populations of african descent become available, the overlap between eqtl identified in this study and gwas snps in these populations should be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a comprehensive map of eqtl in the healthy colon of aa was generated as a resource for genetic studies of colonic diseases. the analysis showing the enrichment of colon eqtl among snps associated with colonic diseases supported the usefulness of colon eqtl as a tissue-specific tool to improve understanding of colonic disease susceptibility. the utility of colon eqtl for studying the genetic basis of inter-ethnic differences in colonic disease risk was demonstrated by showing their enrichment for snps that exhibit high allele frequency differences between european and african populations. these snps could mediate population-specific gene expression responses, which could translate into differences in disease risk.

this study offers novel insights into the functional basis of genetic susceptibility for colonic inflammatory and malignant diseases and provides a tissue-specific resource for future studies. characterization of the genetic architecture of gene regulation in the human colon informs the functional impact of gwas variants and could benefit understanding of the biological differences in colonic disease between different ethnic groups. the findings in this study demonstrate that eqtl are important in the susceptibility to inflammatory and malignant diseases of the colon, underscoring the utility of eqtl mapping for elucidating the genetics and biology underlying colonic diseases. furthermore the eqtl map presented here could benefit understanding of the biological differences in colonic disease between different ethnic groups. this is especially important given that there is a paucity of genetic studies of colonic diseases in aa populations and our understanding of the genetics and etiology of these diseases is based on europeans, which may not be applicable to other populations. further efforts should be made to intersect our eqtl data with ibd and crc genetic studies, for a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms and inter-ethnic differences in these diseases.
