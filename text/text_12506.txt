BACKGROUND
the deep sea is one of the few remaining frontiers in the field of biology. since the discovery of an invertebrate community in the galapagos rift in  <dig>  <cit> , several chemosynthetic ecosystems have been found in hydrothermal vents and hydrocarbon seeps worldwide  <cit> . in these environments, many endemic species, such as vestimentiferan tubeworms, vesicomyid clams, and rimicaris shrimps, have been reported  <cit> . these organisms have evolved to consume new nutrient sources, with chemosynthetic energy obtained through symbiosis with chemosynthetic microbes . in addition to vents and seeps, another type of deep-sea community has also been discovered, referred to as the whale-fall ecosystem  <cit> . when a carcass of a large vertebrate  sinks to the sea floor, the huge source of organic material harbors a variety of organisms. initially, mobile scavengers such as sharks, hagfishes, and crustaceans aggregate and consume the soft tissue of the carcass  <cit> . after the bones of the carcass are exposed, enigmatic marine worms of the genus osedax colonize on the bones  <cit> .


osedax are marine invertebrates that belong to the phylum annelida, family siboglinidae  <cit> . they exclusively inhabit sunken whale bones under natural conditions and are able to colonize bones of other vertebrate species under experimental conditions . since their discovery, at least  <dig> higher taxonomic units have been described worldwide . osedax usually shows remarkable sexual dimorphism, with vermiform females , and microscopic dwarf males   <cit> . osedax has trochophore-type larvae . adult females of osedax consist of four regions: palps, trunk, ovisac, and root. by consuming vertebrate bones, osedax worms play a role in the degradation of sunken body remains and the recycling of deep-sea carbon  <cit> . the female osedax lacks a digestive tract, including a mouth, gut, and anus. instead, it has been suggested that they use their posterior root system as their digestive organ. the posteriorly branching root system is an evolutionary novel organ  <cit> , which penetrates into bones and contains heterotrophic bacteria enclosed in bacteriocytes . it has been suggested that the microvillar root cells secrete digestive enzymes and acid to aid in the degradation and uptake of nutrients from the dissolved bones . although it has been assumed that these endosymbiotic bacteria have a function in the metabolism of nutrients, the specific process remains unclear  <cit> . to address the evolution of osedax worms, an understanding of the origin and detailed function of the root is necessary. a recent study has shown that the root epidermal cells are immunoreactive against anti-vascular proton atpase  and anti-carbonic anhydrase  antibodies  <cit> . this suggests that v-h+ atpase are responsible for dissolving the calcium phosphate in vertebrate bones through acidification of the microenvironment surrounding the root  <cit> . another study, which showed that the root of osedax has collagenolytic activity, suggested that the root tissues that include symbiotic bacteria secrete enzymes to digest the matrix proteins of bones  <cit> . the absence of matrix proteinase gene in the symbiont genomes suggests that host worms are responsible for collagen degradation  <cit> . however, it is not known what varieties of enzymes are secreted from what type of cells, and the mechanisms behind nutrient uptake.fig.  <dig> photographs osedax japonicus. a an adult female living on a bone. white spots around the female are embryos spawned into transparent mucus. b an adult female exposed on a bone. the dot line indicates the position that was cut for rna extraction. upper and lower fragments are trunk palps  and root + ovisac , respectively. c a dwarf male. d a larva with settlement competency. b, bone; em, embryo; ov, ovisac; p, palp; r, root; t, trunk. scale bars: b = 2 mm; c and d = 20 μm




here, we performed transcriptome analysis and examined the spatial and developmental expression patterns of genes related to digestion and nutrient uptake in the bone-eating worm osedax japonicus, which can be reared for multiple generations under laboratory conditions  <cit> . comparing the transcriptomes from the three different tissues: root + ovisac , trunk + palp , and larva + male, we identified the genes that were specifically expressed in the root. we investigated the expression patterns of genes of interest that were considered related to bone digestion and nutrient uptake. the results revealed novel aspects of the molecular mechanisms of the metabolic process of osedax worms.

RESULTS
sequencing of o. japonicus transcriptome
we sequenced three types of rna samples: trunk, root, and larva + male  using a hiseq <dig> sequencer . males of o. japonicus are dwarf males and are approximately 500 μm in length . owing to the small amounts of total rna obtained from males and larvae, these two sample types were combined for sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained and the basic information regarding the raw data and assembly is shown in the supporting information . the raw reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  subcomponents by trinity software  <cit>  with a contig n <dig> of 1383 bp. although the read assembly was still incomplete, we considered these subcomponents to be distinct genetic loci. we set the threshold for gene expression intensity  to eliminate fluctuations or background noise and  <dig>  genes were found above the threshold in at least one sample. among  <dig>  genes, the numbers of trunk, root, and larva + male-specific genes were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the  <dig>  genes were compared against uniprotkb with blastx and  <dig> genes were homologous to known functional genes. among these  <dig> genes,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were trunk, root, and larva + male specific, respectively. the list of root specific gene is shown in the supporting information . raw data are available in the ddbj sequence read archive .

characterization of the root transcriptome
to elucidate the features of o. japonicus transcriptome, we attempted functional annotation of novel sequence data using gene ontology  annotation and a single enrichment analysis against the total o. japonicas transcriptome. go term enrichment analysis showed that  <dig>  nine, and six terms associated with “molecular function,” “cellular component,” and “biological process,” respectively, were significantly over-represented in the root-specific genes against all gene set backgrounds . the over-represented go terms included hydrolase activity, transferase activity, transport, and catalytic activity, which were all related to the nutrient uptake and metabolic processes. only two terms of “molecular function” and a term of “biological process” were under-represented in the root transcriptome .

we also looked for significantly enriched pfam domains  <cit>  in the proteins encoded by the root-specific genes against the total transcriptome . in the root-specific genes, we found  <dig> enriched pfam domains . matrixin , hemopexin , putative peptidoglycan binding domain , and peptidase families  are components of matrix metalloproteinase  proteins, which degrade the extracellular matrix  including various types of collagen. pfam domains related to other types of proteases were also enriched in the root-specific gene set. the peptidase family m <dig>  is a domain found in membrane metalloendopeptidase , which cleaves peptides at the amino side of hydrophobic residues. zinc carboxypeptidase  and carboxypeptidase activation peptide  are domains related to carboxypeptidase activity that hydrolyze peptides at the carboxyl-terminal end of proteins and peptides. we also found an enrichment of domains related to substrate transportation. the amino acid permeases  domain is a component of amino acid transporters belonging to the solute carrier  family transporters, such as the slc <dig> and slc <dig> families. we found that three domains related to another member of the slc transporter family were enriched in the root transcriptome. sodium:sulfate symporter transmembrane region  and citrate transporter  are components of the slc <dig> family na+-sulfate/carboxylate cotransporter. the domain related to a sugar transporter  was also enriched in the root-specific gene set. the abc transporter transmembrane region  and abc transporter  are domains related to the atp-binding cassette  transporter, which translocates a variety of substrates.table  <dig> pfam domains enriched in the root transcriptome




expression of protease genes in the root
to identify cells responsible for protease secretion, we examined expression pattern of genes encoding protease, which degraded the ecm. because pfam domains related to the mmp protein were enriched in the root-specific gene set, we first examined the expression of mmp genes. from the transcriptome of all samples,  <dig> mmp genes containing the catalytic domain with a conserved zinc-binding motif were found. among them,  <dig> mmp genes were detected from the root transcriptome and  <dig> mmp genes were expressed only in the root . we examined the expression of  <dig> mmp genes and performed double staining with a probe against the 16s rrna gene of neptunomonas japonica  infected with o. japonicus to clarify the localization of bacteriocytes harboring symbiotic bacteria.

eight of the  <dig> mmp genes were solely expressed in the epidermis of the root : oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  and oja-mmp <dig>  the details of the expression patterns in these genes differed. oja-mmp <dig> was most broadly expressed . counterstaining with 4′,6-diamino-2-2phenylindole  showed that oja-mmp <dig> was exclusively expressed in epidermal cells . with the exception of oja-mmp <dig>  all of these genes were specific to the root transcriptome  and positive signals were detected only in the peripheral branching region of the root and not in the epidermis of the ovisac. doublestaining with nj 16s rrna indicated that five mmp genes, oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  and oja-mmp <dig> were expressed in bacteriocytes  with all but oja-mmp <dig> also expressed in the root epidermis . three genes, oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  and oja-mmp <dig> were solely expressed in the internal tissues related to the reproductive system. the expression of oja-mmp <dig> and oja-mmp <dig> were detected in the epithelial cells of ovarian tissue . expression of oja-mmp <dig> was detected only in the epithelial cells of the uterus  <cit>  surrounding mature oocytes. counterstaining with dapi showed that oja-mmp <dig> was also expressed in connective tissues around the uterus . in o. japonicus, the ovarian lobe consists of two rows of previtellogenic oocytes. between the two rows of previtellogenic oocytes there are thin cells and oja-mmp <dig> expression was observed in these cells .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of mmp genes in osedax japonicus. purple signals are expression of mmp genes and yellow signals are expression of 16s rrna of neptunomonas japonica. sagittal sections. anterior is top. a–c broad epidermal expression of oja-mmp <dig>  d–j expression patterns of oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  and oja-mmp <dig> in the epidermis of the root. k–n expression patterns of oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  oja-mmp <dig>  and oja-mmp <dig> in the root epidermis and bacteriocytes. o expression of oja-mmp <dig> in bacteriocytes. p expression of oja-mmp <dig> in follicle cells and connective tissue surrounding oocytes. q–s expression of oja-mmp <dig> was detected in the connective tissue surrounding oocytes. counterstaining with dapi indicated that oja-mmp <dig> was also expressed in follicle cells. t

other varieties of proteases were also found in the root transcriptome. three cathepsin bs  were identified in osedax. oja-ctsb <dig> and oja-ctsb <dig> were present exclusively in the root transcriptome, whereas oja-ctsb <dig> was detected in all three transcriptomes . the expressions of oja-ctsb <dig> and oja-ctsb <dig> were detected in the root epidermis . the expression patterns of oja-ctsb <dig> and oja-ctsb <dig> were almost identical, with both genes expressed in the epidermis of the distal part of the branching root. no signal was detected at the proximal part, which is close to the ovaries. the expressions of oja-ctsb <dig> and oja-ctsb <dig> were not ubiquitous in root epidermis. there were negative cells in the distal part of the root, which were thin, whereas the positive regions were thick . mme is a type ii transmembrane glycoprotein and a neutral endopeptidase that belongs to the peptidase family m <dig>  as mentioned above, the peptidase family m <dig> domain was enriched in the root transcriptome . an mme gene, oja-mme was present only in the root transcriptome  and expressed in root epidermal cells .fig.  <dig> expression of protease genes. a, b expression of oja-ctsb <dig> detected in root epidermis. c

expression of transporter genes in the root
slc family transporters play crucial roles in the uptake and efflux of compounds such as sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, inorganic ions, and fatty acids  <cit> . in the o. japonicus transcriptome,  <dig> families in the slc gene superfamily, with at least  <dig> genes, were identified . although the slc gene nomenclature system has been defined in mammals  <cit> , due to low resolution of the phylogenetic analyses and the likely lineage-specific molecular evolution of the slc genes, the genes were named in an osedax-specific manner.

discussion
bone digestion by proteases
vertebrate bones are made of both organic and inorganic components. one of the main inorganic components is calcium phosphate. a previous study reported that osedax root epidermis cells are immunoreactive against anti-v-h+ atpase and anti-ca antibodies  <cit> . the v-h+ atpase and ca are also expressed in the osteoclasts in vertebrates and are involved in the resorption of bones through acidification  <cit> . vertebrate bones and cartilage also contain many different organic components, with the majority being ecm proteins, such as various types of collagens. mmps are a large family of zinc dependent endoproteinases and are able to degrade ecm components  <cit> . vertebrates have seven types of fibrillar collagens, encoded by eleven genes  <cit> . types i, v, and xxiv are components of mineralized bone, whereas types ii, xi, and xxvii are components of cartilage  <cit> . in this study, we found at least  <dig> mmps in o. japonicus. of these genes,  <dig> were expressed in the root epidermis. the number of mmp genes is small in invertebrates , except for in the sea urchin . in vertebrates, at least  <dig> different mmp genes have been identified with  <dig> of them present in humans  <cit> . in spiralians, little is known about mmp genes. we surveyed the genomes of three spiralians: the pacific oyster crassostrea gigas  <cit> , the owl limpet lottia gigantea, and a marine polychaete capitella teleta  <cit> , and found six, eight and five mmp genes, respectively.

this remarkable increase of mmps followed by amino acid substitutions and expression in the root epidermis in o. japonicus most likely enables them to digest various types of ecms in vertebrate bones. in addition to ecm degradation in bone and cartilage, mmps play essential roles in morphogenesis, immune system functioning, and reproduction through the remodeling of ecms in vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . we detected expression of some osedax mmp genes in root epidermis, bacteriocytes, and ovarian tissues. the peculiar shape of the root tissues implies that their morphogenesis is regulated by the repeated growth and remodeling of ecms. some mmps may also have a function during the formation of the root tissue.

in vertebrates, cathepsin k  is highly expressed in the osteoclast and is responsible for the digestion of type i collagen, which is the main component of mineralized bone  <cit> . in o. japonicus, we could not find ctsk in the transcriptome, but three ctsb genes were expressed in the root. ctsb is a papain-like cysteine protease that is usually located in the lysozome in normal cells and tissues in humans  <cit> . in the clam meretrix meretrix and the shrimp pandalus borealis, ctsb are expressed in the digestive tract  and have been reported to have a possible role in nutrient digestion  <cit> . we showed that some protease genes, mmps and ctsbs, were expressed at the early juvenile stage when the worms start to bore into bones, whereas no expression was detected during the larval stage. the expression patterns of protease genes in the host worm, together with the absence of collagenase genes in osedax symbionts  <cit> , strengthen the possibility that the root epidermal cells play critical roles in the digestion of bone matrix proteins .fig.  <dig> schematic illustration of bone digestion and nutrient uptake in osedax japonicus. calcium phosphate in vertebrate bone is digested through acidification of the microenvironment by v-h+-atpase  <cit> . organic components of bones, such as collagens are degraded by proteases secreted from root epidermis. the digested peptides and other nutrients contained in the bones are transported through various membrane transporters. some of the nutrients are transported to symbiotic bacteria, which use the nutrients as a metabolic resource




nutrient uptake and metabolic interaction between host and symbiotic bacteria
the slc superfamily is the largest group of membrane transporter proteins, and includes  <dig> families and  <dig> transporter genes in the human genome  <cit> . the slc transporters play essential roles in nutrient uptake in the intestine as well as in the translocation of various kinds of molecules in other tissues and cell types. the functions of each member of the slc transporter are well characterized in humans  <cit> ; however, little is known about the function of slc transporters in invertebrates. almost all families of the slc transporters are conserved among bilaterians  <cit> . in this study, we confirmed the expression of some slc genes encoding oligopeptide and amino acid transporters in the root epidermis of o. japonicus. in mammals, members of the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter family  are responsible for the absorption of dietary protein digestion products in the intestine  <cit> . in o. japonicas, we found that two genes encoding slc <dig> family transporters were expressed in the root epidermis. root epidermal cells started to express one of two slc <dig> genes at the early juvenile stage, when the animals began a sessile lifestyle and started consuming vertebrate bones. we also detected expression of a gene encoding the amino acid transporter family  in the root epidermis. these transporters are the candidate molecules playing a crucial role in nutrient uptake. further functional analysis will unveil the molecular mechanisms for digestion and absorption by the root of osedax worms.

in this study, we found the expression of genes encoding amino acid, glucose, and monocarboxylate transporters in bacteriocytes. the genome sequence of osedax symbionts showed that they encode a number of transporter genes for various substrates such as amino acids, peptides, and carbohydrates  <cit> . the exact function of symbiotic bacteria in osedax worms is still unclear; however, expression and possession of transporter genes in the host bacteriocytes and symbiont genome suggest the presence of metabolic interaction between osedax and symbiotic bacteria .

CONCLUSIONS
because there is no comparable counterpart close relative of osedax, the root is considered an evolutionary novelty. here, we investigated tissue-specific transcriptome and the expression pattern of genes, which appear to be related to the function of the root. expression of various proteinase including mmp and transporter genes in the root epidermis support the theory that the root epidermal cells are responsible for bone digestion and subsequent nutrient uptake. expression of amino acid, sugar and other metabolite transporter genes in the host bacteriocytes suggests the presence of metabolic interaction between osedax and symbiotic bacteria. further studies using the o. japonicus and n. japonica system, which allows us to examine the biology of both species and the interactions between them, should provide essential information regarding the evolutionary novelty of osedax.
