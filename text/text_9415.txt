BACKGROUND
with an estimated  <dig> million clinical cases and  <dig>  deaths in  <dig>  <cit>  malaria remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases. clinical manifestations are due to successive rounds of plasmodium parasite invasion, replication within host erythrocytes, egress and re-invasion. present efforts to reduce mortality and morbidity focus on the use of curative and preventive drug treatments as well as on vector control strategies  <cit> . those include first-line artemisinin-based combination therapies  that pair a highly potent artemisinin derivative with a longer-acting partner drug  <cit> . acts currently constitute the best regimens to treat 4-aminoquinoline- and antifolate-resistant plasmodium falciparum parasites that have swept across the world. while 20 years were necessary for chloroquine  resistance to spread from its origins in southeast asia to africa  <cit> , resistance to the antifolate combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine disseminated at a much faster pace  <cit> . the recent emergence of delayed parasite clearance following artesunate or act administration in western cambodia and thailand  reemphasizes the need to develop therapeutic strategies to treat drug-resistant p. falciparum malaria and define the molecular basis of resistance.

two key genetic determinants of p. falciparum resistance to antimalarial compounds are pfcrt  <cit>  and pfmdr <dig>  <cit> , which encode transporter proteins that localize to the digestive vacuole membrane of intra-erythrocytic parasites. while their native biological functions remain unknown, the inability to genetically disrupt pfcrt or pfmdr <dig> provides evidence for their essentiality  <cit> . laboratory and field-based studies have demonstrated that pfcrt mutations constitute the primary determinant of in vitro cq resistance and are associated with a substantially increased risk of cq treatment failure in patients . studies with transgenic parasites or heterologous expression systems have attributed pfcrt-mediated cq resistance to drug efflux out of the low-ph digestive vacuole, where cq becomes diprotonated, concentrates up to  <dig> -fold and acts by binding to heme products and preventing heme detoxification . pfcrt mutations can also mediate cross-resistance to amodiaquine and increase susceptibility to lumefantrine, mefloquine and artesunate  <cit> . pfmdr <dig> mutations as well as copy number variations have also been shown to impact p. falciparum susceptibility to several antimalarials  presumably via drug transport across the digestive vacuole  <cit> .

for pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  acquired resistance mutations, or in the case of pfmdr <dig> gene amplifications, are thought to generally impart a fitness cost , presumably via altering their endogenous transport properties to the detriment of normal parasite development and replication. in endemic settings, this fitness cost manifests as a reduced prevalence of mutant pfcrt or pfmdr <dig> following the release of selective drug pressure . however, additional mutations elsewhere in an organism can compensate for the cost of acquiring resistance  <cit>  and restore fitness, as shown for p. falciparum resistance to antifolates . furthermore, the long-term propagation of drug-resistant strains even in the absence of selective pressure suggests adaptive mechanisms that counteract the detrimental effects of resistance-conferring genetic changes  <cit> .

intriguingly, the question of how parasites transcriptionally adjust in the long-term to the acquisition of mutations or gene amplifications in drug resistance transporters has scarcely been addressed. an earlier comparison of the transcriptional profiles of pfcrt mutant strains generated by cq selection from a drug-sensitive parasite line suggested a limited number of changes in the parasite transcriptome  <cit> . that study, however, was restricted to a single time point of p. falciparum development within the host erythrocytes and as such it could not correct for temporal differences in the intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle  between parasite lines. indeed, while transcriptome studies have suggested an inability of the parasite to transcriptionally respond to short-term drug pressure  <cit> , conceivably parasites may be able to evolve over multiple generations to states of optimal growth that adjust for physiological impacts of altered sequence or expression of drug/solute transporters. this is a testable hypothesis for pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  whose expression kinetics are closely tied to the formation of the parasite digestive vacuole during the trophozoite stage. changes in the transcriptome profile of these mutant lines can be assessed in comparison with the carefully documented timeline of tightly regulated gene expression patterns that characterize the p. falciparum idc . these expression patterns underpin the biological processes of intracellular parasite development, replication and egress with accompanying morphological changes as parasites progress from rings to trophozoites to schizonts.

here, we investigated how parasites adjusted transcriptionally to genetic modification of pfcrt or pfmdr <dig>  resulting in altered drug resistance phenotypes following long-term culture. using dna microarrays, we conducted a genome-wide transcriptional profiling of genetically modified isogenic p. falciparum strains with either distinct pfcrt haplotypes or pfmdr <dig> functional copy numbers throughout their 48-hour idc. these previously engineered lines either display a loss of cq resistance following the removal of the k76t mutation  <cit>   or show increased susceptibility to multiple antimalarial drugs  following genetic disruption of one of the two pfmdr <dig> copies present in the multidrug resistant fcb line  <cit> . to analyze the data we developed a computational method that combines fast fourier transform  and gene set enrichment analysis  to correct for temporal differences between samples and compare microarray data between time series. we also used a reference pool of  <dig> profiled parasite lines to distinguish between stochastically variant genes and gene expression differences of biological significance, including those of subtle amplitude. our results revealed a striking and previously unreported correlation between the expression levels of pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  and identified several pathways whose regulation was altered in response to changes in either gene, reinforcing the hypothesis of their functional interplay and the existence of coordinated functional networks.

RESULTS
a fast fourier transform-based method to align microarray time series data between profiled isogenic parasite cell lines
to assess the genomic impact of p. falciparum acquiring genetic changes in transporters that mediate antimalarial drug resistance, we profiled the transcriptome of multiple isogenic lines characterized by altered pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> gene expression levels and/or corresponding protein haplotypes . we also transcriptionally profiled the parental strains and performed both gene-specific and combined comparative analyses of the data sets.table  <dig> summary of the p. falciparum lines used in the study. drug resistance phenotype and pfcrt/pfmdr <dig> phenotypes are indicated

cq: chloroquine,cn: pfmdr <dig> copy number, ctl: control, kd: knockdown, rec: recombinant, utr: untranslated region


aresistant to chloroquine through pfcrt mutations and partially resistant to lumefantrine, mefloquine and quinine through pfmdr <dig> gene amplification


bgenetic ablation of 2nd pfmdr <dig> copy number led to increased susceptibility to lumefantrine, mefloquine and quinine


creduced pfcrt expression through replacement of full-length 5′utr with shorter version resulted in reduced level of cq resistance


dreversion of pfcrt k76t to wild-type k <dig> led to loss of cq resistance


eamino acids that differ from wild-type haplotypes  are shown in bold


ftranscriptome and qrt-pcr studies indicated that 106/ <dig> expresses the equivalent of a single pfmdr <dig> copy, despite having two physical copies



the first data set  included fcbpfmdr1_3′kd, which was engineered via single-site crossover-based disruption of one of the two pfmdr <dig> copies within the duplicated 100-kb genomic region of the multidrug-resistant parasite strain fcb  <cit> . this resulted in a 50 % decrease in pfmdr <dig> gene expression and a reduction of approximately 40 % in its protein level . in addition to fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and its parental line fcb, our transcriptome analysis included 106/ <dig>  a parasite strain that genetically is nearly identical to fcb  <cit> . fcb and fcbpfmdr1_3′kd display the same pfcrt haplotype , whereas 106/ <dig> has a key difference at position  <dig> that expresses a lysine  and confers cq susceptibility  <cit> .

the second data set  included 7g8pfcrt_t76k and 7g8pfcrt_ctl parasite lines that were generated by allelic exchange via single crossover recombination targeting codon  <dig> of the mutant pfcrt allele in the cq-resistant strain 7g <dig>  <cit> . the encoded threonine residue was back mutated to the wild-type lysine in 7g8pfcrt_t76k, resulting in a complete loss of cq resistance, whereas it remained identical to 7g <dig> in the recombinant control 7g8pfcrt_ctl. additionally, the two recombinant lines are characterized by a two-fold reduction in pfcrt mrna and protein expression, allowing us to assess the impact of both the acquisition/loss of a point mutation and alteration in gene expression . of note, 7g8pfcrt_ctl is only moderately cq-resistant, with a mean cq ic <dig> value  that is close to half that of the parental 7g <dig> line  by virtue of the reduced pfcrt expression  <cit> .

to conduct our comparative analysis, tightly synchronous parasites were cultured for the length of a complete idc . rna was extracted from samples collected every 6 h for 48 h and assayed on a 70-mer dna microarray, representing more than  <dig>  p. falciparum genes  <cit> . alignment of each profiled time series to the transcriptome of the reference strain 3d <dig> showed small but significant differences in the idc duration. indeed, the transgenic strains displayed a shorter life cycle than their respective parents .fig.  <dig> alignment of all time series to the 3d <dig> reference transcriptome reveal differences in growth rates between the profiled parasite lines. a plot of all time courses before temporal alignment of the transcriptome data. for each transcriptome data set, the original  <dig> time points of each 48-hour time course ) were aligned to the transcriptome of 3d <dig> that earlier had been elucidated at a one-hour resolution  <cit> . b phaseograms of all parasite lines in the fcb set after dynamic time warping. genes  were ordered according to their phase of expression computed using fast fourier transform , which interpolated expression levels at unassayed time points. the resulting output generated a smooth sine curve with a single peak of maximum expression  for each gene across the entire 48-hour idc. c phaseograms of the three parasite lines in the 7g <dig> set after dynamic time warping. d principal component analysis  confirming the proper alignment of all transcriptomes. the ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig>  genes represented in each transcriptome were used to generate a matrix of values that was reduced to a tri-dimensional projection using pca. the first two principal components accurately recover the progression of the lines through the 48-hour lifecycle while the third principal component focuses on differences between the lines as symbolized by the size of the circles. circle colors refer to the parasite lines depicted in 



given the resulting slight time shifts between the time series, we developed a computational method to align the microarray expression data and to ensure that our comparative analysis would not be skewed by temporal differences in the developmental stage of the different parasite lines at the time of harvesting. we used fft to impute gene expression levels at  <dig> unassayed time points to obtain a  <dig> -minute resolution of each time course . to validate this approach, we first performed a simulation using published transcriptome data sets that constituted of hourly time course data for the strains hb <dig>  dd <dig> and 3d <dig>  <cit> . for each strain we selected  <dig> time points spread 6 h apart, from which we generated a curve of  <dig> imputed points. using pearson correlation values for gene expression, we then compared each actual hourly time point to the imputed curve to identify the closest matching time point. we observed that actual time points from the original time courses matched imputed time points that were fairly evenly spread along the imputation-derived curve, with correlations of average 83–91 % across the range of time points for each strain. this suggests that the imputation method can work on datasets that comprise only eight time points, such as ours.

using our imputed data sets, we then applied a dynamic time warping/pearson correlation coefficient  method to determine for each profiled parasite line the optimal post-invasion time point  along the idc . all time courses were then realigned to the 3d <dig> transcriptome and to each other when performing pairwise comparisons .

phaseograms representing the transcriptome of each strain were assembled by hierarchically clustering the mean-centered log <dig> expression ratios of the genes that passed the different filters , according to their phase of expression calculated as described above. transcriptomes of all strains reproduced the cascade of expression typical of p. falciparum, in which genes are expressed in a highly periodic mode  <cit>  . furthermore, all profiled strains demonstrated excellent synchronicity, with tight clustering of the expression data as observed using principal component analysis , thereby validating the alignment of the time series .

chromosomal mapping of gene expression changes reveals amplicon loss on chromosome  <dig> in fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and down-regulation of a chromosome  <dig> gene cluster in 7g8pfcrt_t76k
to identify genes that were differentially expressed between parasite time series within each data set, steady state transcript levels were analyzed across the idc for each profiled strain and compared to each other. we computed gene expression fold differences for each pairwise comparison as the difference between the areas under the curves, which were extracted from absolute temporal gene expression plots derived from the full  <dig> time point data.

we then generated chromosome maps in which fold changes in expression were plotted as a function of the chromosomal position of each gene. these maps revealed clusters of differential expression in telomeric regions of several chromosomes, possibly indicating hypervariable transcription of genes within these regions, as previously reported  <cit>  . surprisingly, an entire set of genes all located on chromosome  <dig> and overlapping with the 100-kb amplicon containing pfmdr <dig>  appeared to be differentially expressed between fcb and both fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> . all genes within this region except pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig> were expressed two- to four-fold less in fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> as compared to fcb . interestingly, global gene expression profiles within the amplicon region on chromosome  <dig> were extremely similar between fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> . given the overlap with genes that constitute the amplicon in the fcb strain , we performed quantitative real time pcr on parasite genomic dna to assess whether the observed transcriptional differences between fcb and both fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> originated from different copy numbers within the pfmdr <dig> region on chromosome  <dig>  quantitative pcr results indicated that the fcbpfmdr1_3′kd strain has a single copy of the genes that are found duplicated in fcb, including pfmdr <dig>  furthermore, although our microarray data showed a similar down-regulation of these genes in 106/ <dig>  the parasite strain harbored two physical copies of these. these results with 106/ <dig> indicate a different mechanism for reduced gene expression in that chromosomal region, potentially involving silencing of one of the two amplicons .fig.  <dig> differential gene expression detected by chromosome mapping. a chromosome mapping of gene expression fold differences between fcb and fcbpfmdr1_3′kd shows differential transcription of a large fragment on chromosome  <dig> corresponding to the pfmdr1-containing 100-kb amplicon region. for each gene located on chromosome  <dig>  the expression fold difference between fcb and fcbpfmdr1_3′kd was mapped using the chromosomal coordinates. interestingly, pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig>  show higher expression in fcb in comparison to both fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> . the inset shows the genes within the pfmdr1-containing amplicon region. b chromosome mapping of gene expression fold differences between fcb and 106/ <dig> for each gene on chromosome  <dig> with the inset showing genes within the pfmdr1-containing amplicon region. c chromosome mapping of gene expression fold differences between 7g <dig> and 7g8pfcrt_t76k shows differential gene expression of a large number of genes located on chromosome  <dig> . d chromosome mapping of gene expression fold differences between 7g <dig> and 7g8pfcrt_ctl for each gene on chromosome  <dig>  in each pairwise comparison, the fold difference in gene expression was calculated as the difference between the areas under the curve computed on the full  <dig> time point data



the same chromosomal mapping of gene expression fold changes revealed the down-regulation of a cluster of genes on chromosome  <dig> in the back-mutant strain 7g8pfcrt_t76k in comparison to the background strain 7g <dig> . this down-regulation was specific to the back-mutant parasites, as no gene expression difference was observed in that region when comparing the transgenic control strain 7g8pfcrt_ctl to 7g <dig> . interestingly, many of the affected genes encode proteins involved in parasite invasion of host erythrocytes, including merozoite surface proteins  and serine repeat antigen  gene products  .

genetic or transcriptional deamplification of the pfmdr1-containing amplicon has broad transcriptional consequences
to assess the transcriptional variations between the profiled strains, we performed gene expression and gene set enrichment analyses, considering both absolute and normalized gene expression fold changes . we also conducted pairwise comparisons of the transcriptome data sets for three developmental stage windows, corresponding to rings , trophozoites  and schizonts . we observed that more than 70 % of all genes peaked within the same 8-hour window in the pfmdr <dig> dataset while about 80 % of the genes peaked within the same 5-hour window in the pfcrt dataset . overall, the great majority of the observed changes was driven by changes in gene expression levels as opposed to altered timing of expression.

analysis of the pfmdr <dig> data set  showed that many of the genes with significant differences in expression level encoded proteins of unknown function. this analysis also revealed decreased expression of multiple genes involved in rna and protein metabolism upon deamplification of the pfmdr1-containing amplicon region on chromosome  <dig> . among these were genes coding for rna-binding proteins, splicing/exosome elements and protein chaperones and modifiers . in contrast, numerous genes encoding ribosomal protein subunits, or involved in rna translation initiation or protein turnover showed a more than two-fold higher expression level in both strains with lower pfmdr <dig> expression . furthermore, genes mainly involved in transcriptional control, including several elements of the basal transcription machinery, were  <dig> to  <dig> -fold up-regulated in fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> in comparison to fcb. for instance, those encoding a putative rna polymerase ii , and the ap2-containing transcription factors pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig>  <cit>  displayed higher expression in fcbpfmdr1_3′kd . genes encoding chromatin constituents such as the components of the nucleosome core histone h <dig>  and the histone variant h2b  were  <dig> to  <dig> –fold less expressed in fcb in comparison to 106/ <dig> . these results suggest an alteration of the global transcriptional and translational activities in both strains with reduced pfmdr <dig> expression in comparison to fcb.fig.  <dig> genes with significant expression fold changes organized by categories for pairwise comparisons of the transcriptomes in the pfmdr <dig> data set. gene expression fold changes were calculated as the difference between the areas under the curve generated on the full  <dig> time point data and were then normalized using a baseline created by a background pool of  <dig> transcriptomes. for each gene, all  <dig> possible pairwise combinations of transcriptomes created a distribution of expression fold changes, which was used as a normalization factor. a genes showing higher expression in the parental line fcb in comparison to pfmdr1-knock-down strain fcbpfmdr1_3′kd. to identify significant differences in gene expression, we applied a threshold of a fold change > <dig>  and a normalized fold change at least  <dig> standard deviations  above the mean. b genes showing higher expression in fcb in comparison to 106/ <dig>  c genes showing lower expression in the parental line fcb compared to the knock-down strain fcbpfmdr1_3′kd. we applied a threshold of a fold change < <dig>  and a normalized fold change  <dig> sd below the mean. d genes showing lower expression in fcb in comparison to 106/ <dig>  e venn diagrams depicting the overlap of genes with higher  or lower  expression in fcb for the fcb vs. fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and fcb vs. 106/ <dig> pairwise comparisons



multiple genes implicated in cellular metabolism, parasite remodeling and invasion also displayed higher transcript levels in fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> compared to fcb . these observations were confirmed by applying a statistical approach that we termed hypergeometric analysis of time series , which combined fast fourier transform and gsea, to further assess the functional significance of the variations in gene expression observed between the parasite strains . hats, although based on gsea, imputes a gene set enrichment score from the hypergeometric distribution of all gene sets calculated following  <dig>  random permutations, instead of using a weighted kolmogorov-smirnov-like test  <cit> . hats demonstrated that genes more highly expressed in fcb in comparison to fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> were enriched mainly for metabolic and enzymatic activities such as purine/pyrimidine and pyruvate/glutamate metabolic pathways . in contrast, several genes and gene sets associated with transcription regulation, translation initiation including ribosome biogenesis, and proteasome-mediated protein catabolism/turnover, were depleted in fcb in comparison to both strains with lower pfmdr <dig> expression . stage-enrichment analysis  revealed that these differences were detectable mainly during the trophozoite and schizont stages . some of these alterations, including those affecting protein synthesis and protein turnover via proteasome degradation have also been observed in the transcriptional profiles of artemisinin-resistant patient isolates carrying causal mutations in the kelch gene k <dig>  suggesting that these pathways might contribute to general mechanisms adopted by multi-drug resistant parasites  <cit> .fig.  <dig> hypergeometric analysis of time series  for pairwise comparisons of the transcriptomes in the pfmdr <dig> data set. hats was performed by combining fft to align the time series with a hypergeometric distribution approach based on random permutations to compute an enrichment score for each gene set. normalization of the enrichment scores was performed using an expression baseline constituted by a background pool of  <dig> transcriptome data sets . we applied a threshold of normalized gene set rank > <dig>  for gene sets we considered positively enriched and normalized gene set rank < <dig>  for gene sets considered negatively enriched. gene sets were built using go, kegg and the malaria parasite metabolic pathway . a gene sets that are enriched in fcb in comparison to fcbpfmdr1_3′kd . b gene sets that are enriched in fcb in comparison to 106/ <dig> . c gene sets that are depleted in fcb in comparison to fcbpfmdr1_3′kd . d gene sets that are depleted in fcb in comparison to 106/ <dig> . e stage-associated enrichment analysis in fcb in comparison to fcbpfmdr1_3′kd. gene sets with significant enrichment  or depletion  for three windows of the parasite idc correspond to rings , trophozoites  and schizonts . f stage-associated enrichment analysis in fcb in comparison to 106/ <dig>  gene sets with significant enrichment  or depletion  during the same three stages as in . g venn diagrams depicting overlaps of gene sets significantly enriched in fcb  for both fcb vs. fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and fcb vs. 106/ <dig> pairwise comparisons, as identified from our hats analysis. h venn diagrams depicting overlaps of gene sets significantly depleted in fcb  for both fcb vs. fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and fcb vs. 106/ <dig> pairwise comparisons, as identified using hats



further stage-specific analysis showed that gene categories comprising transporters or components localized to the parasite digestive vacuole were significantly enriched  in fcb in comparison to fcbpfmdr1_3′kd in mature asexual blood stages, i.e. when the digestive vacuole is functioning. these genes included two v-type atpases , an aaa family atpase , an abc transporter , and drug/metabolite and amino acid transporters , . these genes sometimes also displayed a higher expression in fcb in comparison to 106/ <dig> .

overall, the global transcriptional response to the deamplification of the pfmdr1-containing amplicon was highly similar between fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig>  for instance, expression analysis of individual genes revealed that both fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> strains in comparison to fcb showed a 2- to 3-fold down-regulation of the genes coding for an atp-dependent rna helicase  and the h <dig> ribonuclease  . these two genes were among the very few that were differentially expressed between the strains across all time points throughout the idc, as demonstrated by stage-specific analysis . hats also identified several gene sets that were enriched or depleted in both fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> in comparison to fcb, which included parasite transporters, components of the proteasome degradation machinery and ribosome constituents . overall, we observed an overlap of greater than 50 % in the gene sets enriched or depleted in both fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> in comparison to fcb . interestingly, we also detected enrichment for gene sets associated with mitochondrial activities such as energy production and electron transport in the fcb versus 106/ <dig> pairwise comparison, but not when comparing fcb with fcbpfmdr1_3′kd . these gene sets in addition to those related to aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis, redox regulation or associated with the parasite digestive vacuole were differentially enriched between both pfmdr <dig> knock-down strains . the contrasting nature of the pfcrt haplotypes between the two strains might account for these differences. this aspect was further addressed when analyzing the pfcrt data set.

drug-resistance mutations in pfcrt affect protein synthesis gene expression
we applied analytical approaches similar to those described above to the pfcrt data set  and performed pairwise comparisons of 7g <dig>  7g8pfcrt_ctl and 7g8pfcrt_t76k transcriptomes. expression analysis for individual genes showed that several genes encoding proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, such as histone deacetylases  and specific transcription factors  from the apiap <dig> family were globally less expressed in the transgenic back-mutant 7g8pfcrt_t76k and control 7g8pfcrt_ctl strains in comparison to the parental line 7g <dig> . additionally, genes involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and activity, such as the mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunits tim <dig> and tim <dig>  and one of the cytochrome c <dig> precursors , showed 2- to  <dig> -fold lower transcript levels in 7g8pfcrt_ctl and 7g8pfcrt_t76k in comparison to 7g <dig> . stage-specific analysis revealed that down-regulation of the genes encoding the tim subunits was most apparent during the schizont stage for both transgenic strains , which shared many of the genes displaying a decreased expression when compared to 7g <dig> . on the other hand pf3d7_ <dig>  which encodes a cardiolipin synthase equally central to the mitochondrial inner membrane, was among the limited number of genes with higher transcript levels in both transgenic strains , particularly at the trophozoite stage . these observations suggest that decreased pfcrt expression, regardless of its haplotype in the 7g <dig> background, might affect mitochondrial integrity and functions.fig.  <dig> genes with significant expression fold changes organized by categories for pairwise comparisons of the transcriptomes in the pfcrt data set. gene expression fold changes were calculated as the difference between the areas under the curve generated on the full  <dig> time point data and were then normalized using a baseline created by the background pool of  <dig> transcriptomes. for each gene, all  <dig> possible pairwise combinations of transcriptomes created a distribution of expression fold changes, which was used as a normalization factor. to identify significant differences, we applied a threshold of a fold change > <dig>  and a normalized fold change at least  <dig> standard deviations  above the mean for higher gene expression, and a threshold of a fold change < <dig>  and a normalized fold change  <dig> sd below the mean for lower expression. a genes with higher expression in the parental line 7g <dig> in comparison to the recombinant control strain 7g8pfcrt_ctl. b genes showing higher expression in 7g <dig> compared to the recombinant back-mutant strain 7g8pfcrt_t76k. c venn diagrams depicting the overlap of genes with higher  or lower  expression in 7g <dig> for both 7g <dig> vs. 7g8pfcrt_ctl and 7g <dig> vs. 7g8pfcrt_t76k pairwise comparisons. d genes with lower expression in comparison with the recombinant control strain 7g8pfcrt_ctl. e genes with lower expression in the parental line 7g <dig> in comparison with the recombinant back-mutant strain 7g8pfcrt_t76k




when examining the pfcrt-modified transgenic strains, we observed increased expression in several genes encoding putative proteins involved in protein folding, trafficking and turnover . these include heat shock and dnaj proteins, which were on average 2-fold more highly expressed in comparison to 7g <dig> . increased expression was also observed with pfhrp <dig> , whose product is hypothesized to be involved in hemozoin formation in the parasite digestive vacuole  <cit> . these observations were confirmed by hats , which provided evidence for higher expression of genes in the categories of chaperones and protein catabolism in both 7g8pfcrt_ctl and 7g8pfcrt_t76k . interestingly, there was a substantial overlap between the gene sets depleted in 7g <dig> in comparison to either 7g8pfcrt_ctl or 7g8pfcrt_t76k . altogether these results suggest that pfcrt transcript levels can influence both parasite-specific processes and general biological pathways irrespective of this transporter’s drug resistance phenotype .fig.  <dig> hypergeometric analysis of time series  for pairwise comparisons of the transcriptomes in the pfcrt data set. as for the pfmdr <dig> dataset, we performed hats analysis by combining fft to align the time series with a hypergeometric distribution approach based on random permutations to compute an enrichment score for each gene set. normalization of the enrichment scores was performed using the expression baseline constituted by the background pool of  <dig> transcriptome data sets. as before, we applied a threshold of normalized gene set rank > <dig>  for gene sets we considered positively enriched and normalized gene set rank < <dig>  for gene sets considered negatively enriched. the gene sets were built using go, kegg, and the malaria parasite metabolic pathway. a gene sets that are enriched  or depleted  in 7g <dig> in comparison with 7g8pfcrt_ctl. b gene sets that are enriched  or depleted  in 7g <dig> in comparison to 7g8pfcrt_t76k. c venn diagrams depicting overlaps of gene sets significantly enriched  or depleted  in 7g <dig> for both 7g <dig> vs. 7g8pfcrt_ctl and 7g <dig> vs. 7g8pfcrt_t76k pairwise comparisons



other genes whose expression was higher in the transgenic 7g <dig> strains in comparison to the parental line were mostly involved in parasite invasion and encoded merozoite surface proteins as well as glideosome and rhoptry components . interestingly, these effects were accentuated in the back-mutant 7g8pfcrt_t76k at both the individual gene as well as gene set levels, during most of the parasite idc .fig.  <dig> analysis of the transcriptional differences between 7g8pfcrt_ctl and 7g8pfcrt_t76k. a genes showing higher expression  in the recombinant control 7g8pfcrt_ctl in comparison to the recombinant back-mutant strain 7g8pfcrt_t76k. gene expression fold changes were calculated as the difference between the areas under the curve generated on the full  <dig> time point data and were then normalized using a baseline created by the background pool of  <dig> transcriptomes. b genes showing a lower expression  in the recombinant control 7g8pfcrt_ctl in comparison to the recombinant back-mutant strain 7g8pfcrt_t76k

we also compared the transcriptional profiles of 7g8pfcrt_t76k and 7g8pfcrt_ctl to assess the impact of the cq resistance phenotype defined by pfcrt k76t. genes differentially expressed between these lines were enriched for functions associated with dna/rna metabolism and protein catabolism . for instance, multiple genes encoding proteins possibly involved in dna replication, such as mini-chromosome maintenance proteins , dna helicases , a nucleotide excision repair enzyme  and the dna polymerase α subunit  were ~2-fold more highly transcribed in 7g8pfcrt_ctl . higher expression of some of these genes was observed throughout the idc as shown by stage-specific analysis . transcripts involved in rna processing such as components of the exosome complex  showed ~ <dig>  to 3-fold higher levels in 7g8pfcrt_ctl, mainly during the ring and trophozoite stages . these observations were confirmed by hats analysis .

expression analysis of individual genes and gene sets indicated that genes involved in translation and protein stability, trafficking and turnover, such as those encoding ribosomal subunits and protein chaperones, respectively were also more highly transcribed in the transgenic control line 7g8pfcrt_ctl . stage-specific analysis demonstrated that higher expression of some of these genes was detected throughout the entire idc . furthermore, hats revealed that the categories of amino-acyl-trna ligases and synthetases were depleted in the back-mutant strain in comparison to both parental and control lines , although several individual genes within these categories, including some encoding a glutamate-trna ligase , displayed higher expression in 7g8pfcrt_t76k at either ring or schizont stages . interestingly, hats showed that gene sets linked to trna aminoacyl biosynthesis were also enriched in 7g8pfcrt_ctl in comparison to the parental strain . several trna-ligases  and ribosyltransferases  also displayed higher transcript levels in a stage-specific manner , suggesting that translation may also be affected when mutant pfcrt expression is lowered . pathways linked to proteasome-mediated degradation and ribosome biogenesis were among the multiple genes and gene sets depleted in both control and parental strains in comparison to the back-mutant 7g8pfcrt_t76k . altogether these observations indicate that the acquisition of drug-resistance mutations in pfcrt may impact protein synthesis and turnover pathways.

expression analysis for individual genes identified several transporters in addition to pfcrt that were differentially expressed between the two transgenic strains , mostly in a stage-specific manner . this finding suggests a possible crosstalk between pfcrt and other transporters. for example, ~2-fold higher transcript levels of the abc transporter pf3d7_ <dig> and the folate transporter ft <dig>  were detected in 7g8pfcrt_ctl , while genes encoding amino acid  and abc transporters  were ~ <dig> -fold more expressed in the back-mutant during either the ring or trophozoite stages .

comparison of gene expression patterns across all profiled transcriptomes reveals a transcriptional network that encompasses both pfcrt and pfmdr1
our comparative analysis of the transcriptome profiles of the fcb- and 7g8-derived parasite lines demonstrated that mutations and/or altered transcript levels in pfmdr <dig> or pfcrt impacted the expression of similar gene categories. we therefore assessed whether a transcriptional association between pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> might account for the similarities we observed between the transcriptome data sets.

using the publicly available transcriptome data sets of the p. falciparum strains 3d <dig>  dd <dig>  and hb <dig>  <cit>  that we added to our own data sets, we first performed an expression-based hierarchical clustering of the data, using pcc distances between gene pairs computed across all possible pairwise comparisons of transcriptomic profiles. pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> ranked closely to each other, and formed two distinguishable clusters with high scores for gene pair correlations . one of these clusters included a v-type atpase localized in the parasite digestive vacuole , a dnaj chaperone protein  and a transcription factor of the apiap <dig> family  . the other cluster contained the rna polymerase i responsible for rrna transcription  . interestingly, the two clusters also contained pf3d7_ <dig> that encodes the histone acetyltransferase gcn <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig>  a gene involved in lipoamide synthesis, which is in concordance with a recent study reporting the co-expression of pfcrt with lipoamide synthesis genes  <cit> . altogether these observations suggest an association between pfmdr <dig> and pfcrt expression and that of genes with specialized functions in the digestive vacuole, in addition to genes having more general functions such as rrna transcription and protein translation.fig.  <dig> investigation of pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> expression networks: gene expression correlations between all p. falciparum genes and pfcrt/pfmdr <dig>  a cluster heatmap of expression data for p. falciparum genes. the hierarchical clustering was generated using pearson correlation coefficients  calculated using log2-transformed and normalized expression values of  <dig>  genes across  <dig> pairwise comparisons of  <dig> parasite transcriptome data sets. heatmaps of the hierarchical clustering show several domains of high correlation between gene pairs, including a large cluster corresponding to strong interactions between plasmepsin x  and multiple genes involved in cell motility such as myosin , kinesin-like protein  and invasion like rhoptry  or imc1-related  proteins. two smaller clusters  are shown including one containing both pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  b venn diagrams showing the number of genes whose expression highly correlates   or anti-correlates   with that of both pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  pcc values were calculated using log2-transformed and normalized expression values of  <dig> genes across  <dig> pairwise comparisons of  <dig> parasite transcriptome data sets



to further investigate the transcriptional association between pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  we conducted an additional hierarchical clustering of gene expression, this time, by ordering genes based on the level of correlation they displayed with either pfcrt or pfmdr <dig> expression . while more than a hundred genes showed a high transcriptional correlation  with each gene, we also detected a large number of genes that were strongly anti-correlated  . interestingly, many genes  with strong positive or negative transcriptional correlation with pfcrt were additionally strongly correlated with pfmdr <dig> expression . a dozen of those genes encode transporters, components of the digestive vacuole, or redox enzymes . others were linked to dna/rna-dependent processes, translation, and protein trafficking  . on the other hand, several genes implicated in either rna processing or protein catabolism, such as those encoding splicing factors and elements of the proteasome complex, respectively, showed a strong anti-correlation with both pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> expression . these findings suggest the existence of a transcriptional network that encompasses both genes and evoke a possible functional association between these two drug resistance transporters.table  <dig> table summarizing categories of genes with strong positive  and negative correlation  of expression with that of both pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  genes correlated or anticorrelated with pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> transcript levels

discussion
studies have previously defined the malaria parasite transcriptome as hard-wired, capable only of very limited changes at the transcript level in response to specific metabolic challenges  <cit> . nevertheless, more recent studies have predicted gene functions and networks using genome-wide transcriptional profiling of p. falciparum growth perturbations, and have provided evidence that the parasite can display transcriptional changes even if of low amplitude in response to chemical challenges  <cit> . in the present study, we have addressed how variant forms of two primary determinants of parasite drug susceptibility can affect the asexual blood stage transcriptome. this focused on a comparative analysis of the transcriptome profiles of p. falciparum parasite lines engineered to display distinct levels of expression and/or mutation in the genes coding for the drug resistance transporters pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  genome-wide analysis of the transcriptomes was performed both at the gene and gene set levels using computational approaches that identified and excluded transcriptional differences due to stochastic expression. this enabled us to define a transcriptional baseline and detect genes whose expression significantly diverged, implicating them as candidate factors in a parasite transcriptional adaptation to the pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> changes that were genetically introduced.

among the ~ <dig>  coding genes in p. falciparum genome, we surveyed the expression changes for a set of  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes for which the microarray data passed quality inspection across at least  <dig> of the  <dig> time points in the series. it is therefore possible that we missed additional genes with differential transcriptional profiles. despite this limitation, we found that genetic modifications of the loci coding for these two digestive vacuole transporters notably affect the transcription of genes coding for rna-binding proteins, transcription factors, elements of the translation initiation and elongation machinery, and components of both the spliceosome and proteasome complexes. this observation was particularly striking in the pfmdr <dig> data set that included the fcb isogenic strain, fcbpfmdr1_3′kd. deamplification of a large region on chromosome  <dig> that encompassed pfmdr <dig> led to the increased expression of genes involved in translation and reduced levels of transcripts implicated in protein catabolism and modifications. this represented in total more than 10 % of the global expression changes and is concordant with expression quantitative trait loci analyses that previously demonstrated an association between the pfmdr1-containing amplicon and both post-translational modifications and protein catabolic processes  <cit> . in agreement with that study  <cit> , we identified a large number of genes involved in proteasome-mediated degradation and protein ubiquitination that display differential expression between fcb and fcbpfmdr1_3′kd. this suggests that amplification of the pfmdr1-containing amplicon can be accompanied by a global reduction of dna and rna metabolic activities, and increased protein catabolism.

our study also identified mechanisms of transcriptional down-regulation across the pfmdr <dig> amplicon in both 106/ <dig>  and fcbpfmdr1_3′kd . earlier studies of thai field isolates had shown considerable variability in both pfmdr <dig> copy number and amplicon size, which would impact expression levels of both pfmdr <dig> and its neighboring genes  <cit> . our data highlight the need to account for expression when assessing the association between pfmdr <dig> copy number and drug susceptibility states, and underscore the potential for additional biological differences resulting from neighboring loci.

differential expression of genes with a role in fundamental biological processes such as rna translation, ubiquitin-dependent catabolic processes and protein folding/trafficking was also observed in the pfcrt data set, albeit to a lesser extent. gene sets associated with these pathways showed a greater enrichment in both 7g8-derived transgenic strains that were characterized by a decreased pfcrt transcript level, in comparison to the parental 7g <dig> line. this suggests an association between the degree of pfcrt expression and the regulation of cellular protein levels, regardless of pfcrt haplotype.

intriguingly, levels of pfcrt transcripts, irrespective of the transporter polymorphism, also impacted sets of genes implicated in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, as indicated by the significant decrease in expression of genes coding for multiple subunits of the translocase complexes of the mitochondria inner membrane  <cit> . in contrast, the transgenic strains that differ in the nature of the residue at position  <dig> in pfcrt displayed a differential enrichment of gene sets associated with amino-acyl trna synthases and ligases. several of the genes coding for these elements, which play a central role in rna translation, were more highly expressed in a stage-specific manner in the transgenic control in comparison to the back-mutant strain. these findings suggest that the impairment of pfcrt transport function through the acquisition of resistance mutations might impact the cellular level of amino acids. this hypothesis is consistent with the observation that pfcrt polymorphisms affect hemoglobin catabolism and that cq-resistant parasites such as 7g <dig> are characterized by a phenotype of excessive peptide accumulation, which might in turn impact the reserve of amino acids available for protein synthesis  <cit> . additionally, the differential expression of genes encoding putative transporters between the two transgenic strains suggest that pfcrt resistance mutations might more generally affect intracellular transport dynamics, possibly as a secondary effect of the peptide accumulation phenotype.

interestingly, both pfmdr <dig> and pfcrt transcriptome data sets displayed differences in the level of expression of genes coding for invasion proteins. higher transcript levels of rhoptry and merozoite surface proteins, or components of the glideosome were detected in parasite strains with either reduced pfmdr <dig> expression such as fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig> or with a pfcrt wild-type haplotype such as the back-mutant strain 7g8pfcrt_t76k. this, added to the observation that both cq-sensitive strains 106/ <dig> and 7g8pfcrt_t76k had a shorter idc than the other parasites, suggests an impact of these genetic changes on growth rates and parasite fitness  <cit> . interestingly, while 106/ <dig> and fcb have genome sequences that are almost identical  <cit>  , our data indicate notable differences in both their pfcrt haplotype and their levels of expression from the pfmdr <dig> amplicon region. by comparing fcb, fcbpfmdr1_3′kd and 106/ <dig>  we could disentangle the transcriptional changes due to lower expression/gene copy variation in the chromosome  <dig> amplicon from the effect of different pfcrt genotypes. for instance, 106/ <dig> appears to express higher levels of ribosomal protein genes compared to both fcb strains, suggesting a response to its particular pfcrt haplotype that lacks the cq resistance-conferring k76t mutation. on the other hand, our data suggest that the transcriptional downregulation of the pfmdr1-containing amplicon on chromosome  <dig>  might affect parasite physiology, notably through the reduced expression of genes coding for multiple transporters and components of the parasite digestive vacuole, such as abc and drug/metabolite transporters and v-type atpases. such an observation was particularly striking when performing a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes by stage, demonstrating how such an approach can complement analyses of gene expression averaged across time points.

our investigations across multiple lines uncovered evidence of co-regulation of pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  which both also positively correlated across the genome with a suite of genes coding for transporters, components of the parasite digestive vacuole that include peptidases involved in hemoglobin catabolism, or redox enzymes. conversely, pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> transcription anti-correlated with a set of genes encoding proteins involved in rna processing, including splicing factors. broader biological processes including transcriptional regulation, translation and post-translational processing contained genes that showed either positive or negative correlations with pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  overall this suggests the existence of an elaborate equilibrium in p. falciparum gene expression that maintains optimal states of parasite physiology that extend beyond the digestive vacuole.

our study builds on the recent work from siwo and colleagues who constructed pfcrt co-expression networks using transcriptional measurements at the early trophozoite stage for the progeny of a genetic cross between cq-sensitive and cq-resistant parental strains  <cit> . their analysis provided evidence that functional partners of both cq-resistant and cq-sensitive pfcrt include genes involved in hemoglobin catabolism, which agrees with our own observations. additionally, the authors attributed divergence in co-expression networks between cq-resistant and cq-sensitive pfcrt to genes involved in dna repair and histone acetylation. interestingly, we found that expression of the histone acetyltransferase gcn <dig>  clustered with that of pfcrt and pfmdr <dig>  further highlighting an association between the expression of these two transporters and general transcriptional processes.

furthermore, our data extend prior observations of joint contributions of pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> polymorphisms to drug resistance phenotypes  <cit> , including evidence of linkage disequilibrium, by now providing evidence of a strong correlation between pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> transcript levels. this has direct implications for drug resistance studies that measure pfmdr <dig> copy number as a marker of decreased parasite susceptibility to antimalarial drugs  <cit>  by implying an previously unrecognized role for accompanying changes in pfcrt.

CONCLUSIONS
pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> are two key determinants of p. falciparum parasite susceptibility to antimalarial compounds. both are transporters localized in the intra-erythrocytic digestive vacuole, whose primary functions in addition to carrying antimalarial drugs remain to date unknown. our transcriptome profiling of various p. falciparum strains, whose differences in pfcrt or pdmr <dig> coding sequence or copy number contribute directly to multidrug resistance, provide insight into how the acquisition of these genetic changes impact parasite physiology beyond the digestive vacuole. these changes include peptide catabolism, digestive vacuole homeostasis, rna metabolism and protein synthesis. our findings, based on the development of an analytical method that we term hypergeometric analysis of time series, also reveal a closely coordinated co-regulation of pfcrt and pfmdr <dig> transcript levels. of particular interest now will be to further study how these transcriptional crosstalks affect downstream processes, in particular at the level of the parasite proteome and metabolome.
