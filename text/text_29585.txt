BACKGROUND
saturated genetic linkage maps  are required for the efficient and effective deployment of markers in plant breeding and genomic analysis. linkage map applications include, but are not limited to: gene mapping, positional cloning, qtl analysis, mas, epistasis dissection, linkage disequilibrium analysis, comparative genomics, physical and genetic map integration, and genome assembly. the construction of highly saturated maps is often a time-consuming process, especially if investigators are employing different parental stocks and markers are not easily transferable. merged maps are attractive since their integration allows for an increase in marker density without the need of additional genotyping, increased marker portability , improved marker alignment precision , and broader inferential capabilities . a number of integrated linkage maps have been developed in numerous economically important crop plants including grapevine   <cit> , lettuce   <cit> , maize   <cit> , red clover   <cit> , ryegrass   <cit> , wheat   <cit> , among others.

the genome of melon  is relatively small , consisting of  <dig> chromosomes. the first molecular marker-based melon map was constructed in  <dig>  <cit>  using mainly restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers and morphological traits, although the markers did not cover the predicted  <dig> melon chromosomes. this was comparatively late for a major crop species like melon that is among the most important horticultural crops in terms of worldwide production  and which production has been increased around 40% in the last ten years  <cit> . subsequently, the first linkage maps that positioned markers on  <dig> linkage groups  were constructed few years later, using the f <dig> progeny of a cross between the korean accession pi <dig> and the melon type "pinyonet piel de sapo"  <cit>  and two recombinant inbred line  populations derived from the crosses "védrantais" × pi <dig> and "védrantais" × pi <dig>  <cit> . however, these maps had few markers in common and different lg nomenclature, making comparative mapping intractable. more recently, dense linkage maps have been constructed using simple sequence repeat   <cit>  and single nucleotide polymorphism   <cit>  markers. nevertheless, although these maps share common markers, they possess large numbers of map-specific markers that makes map-wide comparisons complicated.

melon germplasm displays an impressive variability for fruit traits and response to diseases  <cit> . recently, part of this variability has been genetically dissected by qtl analysis  <cit> . inter-population qtl comparisons among these maps are, however, difficult given the aforementioned technical barriers.

databases integrating genomic, genetic, and phenotypic information have been well developed in some plant species such as the genome database for rosaceae  <cit> , sol genomics network for solanaceae  <cit>  or gramene  <cit> , and provide powerful tools for genomic analysis. in  <dig>  the international cucurbit genomics initiative   <cit>  was created to further genomic research in cucurbitaceae species by integrating genomic information in a database . thirteen private seed companies funded this project, which sought to construct an integrated genetic melon map through merging existing maps using common ssr markers as anchor points. we present herein an integrated melon map, including the position of qtl controlling economically important traits, to facilitate comparative mapping comparison and to create a dynamic genetic backbone for the placement of additional markers and qtl.

RESULTS
construction of the integrated map
anchor molecular markers
based on their previously observed even map distribution, polymorphism, and repeatability,  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> snp marker  were chosen as anchor points to integrate the eight genetic maps . anchor marker segregation varied among maps, where the greatest number of polymorphic anchor markers were in irta   <cit>  and inra   <cit>  maps containing  <dig> and  <dig> anchor polymorphic markers, respectively. the minimum number of anchor polymorphic markers was recorded in the nercv   <cit>  map . most of the anchor markers were originally mapped in the irta population, that shared a common parent  with the inra population, while the other parent was an occidental cultivar , so it was actually expected that the proportion of markers that can be transferred successfully from irta to inra populations is larger than to the any other studied population developed from different germplasm.

summary of the mapping populations used to construct the integrated map. each map is named by the abbreviation of the collaborating institutions . the genotypes used as mapping parents belong to the subspecies , and the market class and horticultural group are classified according to pitrat et al.   <cit> . the dhl population of  <dig> genotypes is actually a selected sample for bin mapping of the  <dig> dhls  <cit> . the number of polymorphic anchor markers segregating within each map and the maximum number of markers shared by each map with at least one of the other maps are also shown.

molecular marker segregation analysis among individual maps
considerable and significant skewed marker segregations  were detected in seven genomic regions of the dhl-based irta map . although significant skewed segregations were also detected in a region on lg viii of the f2-based irta map  <cit> , on lgs i, iv, and vi in nivts  map  <cit>  and on lgs v, vii, viii and x in the aro  map  <cit> . no significant segregation distortion was detected in the other maps used herein . the relatively high number of genomic regions with skewed segregation detected in the dhl-based map reinforces the hypothesis that such distortion likely originated from unintentional selection during the in vitro line development process  <cit> . the low number of genomic regions showing skewed segregation in most melon maps contrasts with that reported in other crops such as lettuce  <cit> , red clover  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , and tomato  <cit> . the degree of such distortion has been correlated to the extent of taxonomic divergence between mapping parents  <cit> . the use of inter-specific hybrids in order to construct genetic maps is a common strategy to ensure the availability of a high number of polymorphic markers, and in such cases segregation distortion may be frequent  <cit> . however, depending on the relative frequency and intensity, segregation distortion may not interfere on the map construction. nevertheless, such distortion may hinder the transfer of economically important alleles during plant improvement. the comparatively low frequency of segregation distortion present in melon maps may be partially explained by the use of intra-specific crosses during population development. given the infrequent occurrence of segregation distortion in melon, the introgression of novel, economically important alleles from exotic melon germplasm into elite modern cultivars should be relatively unimpeded.

marker polymorphism and recombination rates among individual maps
the number of polymorphic markers for individual maps ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . inra and irta maps consisted of  <dig> lgs, coinciding with the basic chromosome number of melon, whereas the remaining maps consisted of more lgs . the number of common markers in pairwise individual map comparisons was quite variable, with a mean of  <dig> common markers among maps. each individual map shared between  <dig> and  <dig> markers with at least one of the other maps . marker order and recombination rates among markers were very consistent among maps, where significant recombination rate heterogeneities  were detected between only a few marker pairs . similar results have been found during genetic map integration in grapevine  <cit> , but more frequent recombination rate differences have been reported among integrated maps in apple   <cit> , brassica ssp.  <cit> , and lettuce  <cit> . differences in locus order and recombination rates may be attributed, in part, to bands that were scored as single alleles instead of duplicated loci or to evolutionary events . nevertheless, it must be concluded from the data presented that major chromosomal rearrangements have not occurred during the recent evolutionary history  of this species.

consensus linkage map
the construction of the integrated map described herein involved two stages: 1) the building of a framework map by merging all the available maps  using joinmap  <dig>   <cit> ; 2) the addition of subsequent markers using a "bin-mapping" approach  <cit> .

given the high co-linearity among melon maps,  <dig> markers from all maps were initially employed for map integration. however,  <dig>  of these markers could not be included in the final integrated map. this proportion was smaller than that obtained during map integration of lettuce , and larger than in the grapevine integrated map . the markers segregating within each individual map were quite complementary, what made the inclusion of a large number of markers into the final merged map possible. for example, the irta_f <dig> map was constructed with an important proportion of rflp markers that were not used in most of the other maps. however, this map had enough rflp markers in common with the irta_ldh map, which has a good proportion of common markers with inra  and nivts  maps, making possible to integrate the irta_f <dig> rflp markers in the final map.

given the congruency detected among melon maps, the inability to incorporate some previously mapped markers into the integrated map is likely due to the lack of sufficient linkage among markers in some genomic regions, especially in small lgs drawn from some individual maps where there was a paucity of common framework map markers.

the framework integrated map contained  <dig> markers  spanning  <dig> cm that were distributed across  <dig> lgs with a mean genetic distance between adjacent loci of  <dig>  cm . integrated map length was similar to previously published maps . while the largest marker gap was  <dig> cm , the remaining gaps were less than  <dig> cm, and occurred mainly on the distal ends of lgs . these gaps are likely due to the lack of sufficient common anchor markers in some maps or slight inconsistencies  among maps.

bin-mapping subsequently resulted in the addition of  <dig> markers  producing the final integrated map containing  <dig> markers  with a mean marker density of  <dig>  cm/marker . one hundred and seventy-eight of these markers were developed, released, or mapped for the first time for the icugi consortium. the marker saturation of this integrated map is far greater than previously published maps , increasing dramatically the number of easily transferable markers from  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig> snps and from  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig> ssrs. noteworthy is the fact that  <dig> previously bin-mapped markers were positioned on the integrated map after being genotyped in several populations. in each case, these markers mapped to their predicted positions inferred by the bin mapping approach , demonstrating the suitability of the bin mapping set  <cit>  to quickly map new markers onto the melon reference map.

distribution and density of markers across the  <dig> linkage groups, specifying the number of markers that were integrated using joinmap  <dig>   and bin mapping.

several markers previously mapped using the bin mapping strategy  <cit>  were included in the integrated map. the expected interval for position of the markers in centimorgans  in the integrated map based on the markers defining the bins according to fernandez-silva et al.   <cit>  is shown in the "bin position" column, while the actual position in the integrated map is given in the "integrated map position" column.

marker distribution in the integrated map varied depending on the marker type. for instance, aflp markers clustered mainly in certain regions of lgs i, ii, iii, v, vi, viii, and × . aflp clustering has been commonly reported , and it is usually associated with heterochromatic regions near centromeres. even though regions showing aflp clustering are likely indicative of centromeric positions, comprehensive cytogenetic analyses would be necessary to demonstrate this association in melon. in contrast, ssr, snp and rflp markers were generally more evenly distributed throughout the genome. similar conclusions can not be reached about the remaining markers  due to their low number. nevertheless, ssr marker clustering was observed in lgs iii, iv, vii, viii, xi, and xii, involving mainly ssr markers originated from genomic libraries , not from ests. this result might indicate that those ssrs are located in repetitive dna regions as centromeres or telomeres. however, such ssr marker clusters did not overlap those of aflps, even though these clusters were in the same lg , suggesting that ssr marker clustering may be due to reasons not associated with centromeric or telomeric regions.

integration of qtl information
eighteen previously reported melon-mapping experiments identified  <dig> qtl for  <dig> traits , and these were aligned in the integrated map described herein. the distribution of these qtl varied from  <dig> on lg iv to  <dig> on lg viii . the number of qtls defined per trait ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with qtl for fs, fw, and ssc being identified in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the previously reported  <dig> mapping experiments, respectively. the number of qtl experiments in melon must be considered modest when compared with other major species, with a significant number of the traits being genetically characterized in only one or two different mapping experiments, which thereby limits the meta-analysis of qtl in this species.

even though additional studies would be necessary to draw definitive conclusions, the position of fs qtl tend to be more consistent among experiments than those for fw and ssc qtl, mapping on lg i in six out of seven works, and on lgs ii, vi, vii, viii, xi, and xii in at least three experiments. clustering of fw and ssc qtl was, however, only observed in lgs viii and xi, and in lgs ii, iii, and v, respectively. fs is a highly heritable trait in melon, whereas fw and ssc usually show a lower heritability  <cit> . the differences in qtl detection among experiments might be partially explained by trait heritability differences. another possible explanation is that the variability of fs among the germplasm used in the experimental crosses might be controlled by a low number of common qtl with large effects, whereas a higher number of qtl with lower effects and/or more allelic variability among them might be underling ssc and fw.

utility of the integrated molecular and qtl map
the integrated map described herein dramatically enhances the development and utility of genomic tools  over previous melon maps. a large proportion of the markers in the integrated map are ssrs and snps, which are easily transferable across laboratories. moreover, the populations used to construct the integrated map include genotypes from the most important market class cultivars  in broad horticultural groups , guaranteeing the future utility of the markers in a broad range of cultivars and experimental crosses. the high marker density of the map allows for the selection of specific markers to customize mapping and molecular breeding applications, such as fine mapping, the development of novel genetic stocks , mas, and hybrid seed production.

the positioning of economically important qtl in the integrated map and the standardization of trait nomenclature will facilitate comparative qtl analyses among populations of different origins to provide deeper insights into the genetic control of the diverse phenotypic variability observable in melon germplasm. for example, qtl for ssc on lg iii co-localize with qtl associated with suc, glu, and sweet, suggesting perhaps the existence of pleiotropic effects . the search of candidate genes is also facilitated, as presently little correlation has been detected between candidate gene and trait for ethylene production  <cit> , fruit flesh firmness  <cit> , carotenoid content  <cit> , or sugar accumulation  <cit> . these associations were studied in single population, which limits the possibility of identifying associations between candidate genes and qtl. multi-population analysis is a more powerful approach for detecting qtl/candidate gene associations. for instance, two clusters of qtl involved in carotenoid accumulation and flesh color co-localized with carotenoid-related genes: cmcrtr and boh_ <dig> in lg vi and cmbcyc and lycb in lg viii , and as such become candidate genes for those qtl. similar associations can been found between genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism and transport and clusters of qtl related to fruit sugar content on lgs ii, iii, v, viii, and x. likewise, associations have been detected between ethylene biosynthesis genes and groups of qtl with effects on fruit ripening on lg viii.

preliminary synteny analyses have been conducted between cucumber and melon based on the irta snp and est-ssr based melon map  <cit>  and the cucumber genome sequence  <cit> . a large number of est-based markers  mapped in the integrated map will facilitate synteny studies with cucumber and other cucurbit species such as watermelon, squash, and pumpkins as genomic information on such species becomes available. most cucurbit species display a myriad of variability for economically important vegetative  and fruit  traits. comparative qtl mapping based on syntenic relationships will allow the evaluation of associations between the allelic constitution at the same genetic loci and the phenotypic variability among the different cucurbit species, as is the case with fruit size between pepper and tomato in solanaceae family  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
eight molecular marker melon maps were integrated into a single map containing  <dig> markers, with a mean marker density of  <dig>  cm/marker, increasing dramatically the density over previously published maps in melon. the integrated map contains a large proportion of easily transferable markers  and putative candidate genes that control fruit ripening, flesh softening, and sugar and carotenoid accumulation. moreover, qtl information for  <dig> traits from  <dig> different mapping experiments was integrated into the melon map that, together with the mapped candidate genes, may provide a suitable framework for qtl/candidate gene analysis. in summary, the integrated map will be a valuable resource that will prompt the cucurbitaceae research community for next generation genomic and genetic studies. all the individual maps, the integrated map, marker and qtl information are available at icugi web site . researchers interested in including their qtl data into the integrated map may contact the corresponding author.
