BACKGROUND
divergent selection is a major driving force in speciation models involving taxa with overlapping geographic distributions, either during sympatric speciation or via reinforcement of isolation between allopatric incipient species after secondary contact  <cit> . the capacity for divergent selection to promote reproductive isolation among populations depends on the strength of selection, the number of traits upon which selection is acting and the rates of realised gene flow  <cit> . initially, wu  <cit>  proposed that only strong selection concentrated on a few traits may overcome substantial gene flow, at least for those specific genomic regions which initiate sympatric speciation. however, recent studies have shown much wider divergence across numerous genomic regions between closely related insect ecotypes .

in insects of medical importance, the speciation process may also have a public health dimension. culex pipiens sensu stricto is a widespread mosquito species with an important medical and veterinary impact owing to its role in the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses  such as the potentially-fatal zoonotic west nile virus  <cit> . culex pipiens s.s. is comprised of two distinct forms, denoted pipiens and molestus, which are morphologically indistinguishable but exhibit behavioural and physiological differences that are likely to impact pathogen-transmission. the molestus form is differentiated from pipiens by four key ecological/physiological characteristics: autogeny , stenogamy , homodynamy , and mammophily   <cit> .

in southern european/mediterranean regions, the two cx. pipiens s.s. forms are sympatric in aboveground habitats, but in northern regions of europe, russia and the usa, molestus and pipiens segregate into underground and aboveground habitats, respectively . a continuous life cycle may be a limitation for surviving in colder climates which may restrain the habitat choice of molestus, while autogeny and stenogamy are important traits for survival in confined underground habitats with restricted access to blood meals. genomic regions associated with these differentiated traits are currently unknown, as is the degree of ecologically-driven genomic divergence between the forms.

populations with mixed characteristics between molestus and pipiens have been found in southern european regions  where inter-form gene flow has been detected, resulting in a pattern of asymmetric introgression from molestus into pipiens  <cit> . moreover, an unusual biting preference for birds has been described in the molestus form in southern europe  <cit> . populations with mixed characteristics were also found in usa  <cit> .

two hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of molestus and pipiens forms. one that the molestus form is polyphyletic; derived from the pipiens form through multiple independent adaptations to underground anthropogenic habitats  <cit> . the second hypothesis considers molestus as an evolutionarily independent entity from southern latitudes, which has secondarily colonized northern underground habitats  <cit> . microsatellite-based studies showed common ancestry of geographically distinct populations of molestus, supporting its status as a single evolutionary entity  <cit> . however, these studies did not compare aboveground european molestus  and american underground molestus with other geographic populations of this form.

in this study, we performed an aflp-based genome scan on geographically-distinct cx. pipiens s.s. samples. the main goals of this study were: i) to determine if european and american populations of each form present similar genetic backgrounds; ii) to infer the divergence between molestus and pipiens forms by fst estimates; and iii) to quantify outlier rates in inter-form comparisons. our results provide an insight into how the genetic background of pipiens and molestus forms varies based on their geography and population characteristics . this information is crucial for understanding the impacts of habitat adaptation and ecological speciation within this species.

RESULTS
dominant markers and error rates
a total of  <dig> dominant markers were obtained from  <dig> primer combinations used in the selective amplification . the markers obtained by the primer combinations ecori-acg/msei-cga  and ecori-acg/msei-acc  yielded high proportions of mismatches between replicates  and were removed prior to subsequent analysis. the proportion of mismatches from the remaining  <dig> dominant markers varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % . error rates for these  <dig> primer combinations averaged  <dig>  and  <dig>  % for the probabilities calculated by aflpscore  <cit>  of mis-scoring a peak as absent if present, and vice versa. error rates for each primer combination are detailed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

the dataset showed an average of  <dig> loci per primer-combination with only two combinations yielding more than  <dig> loci . the  <dig> loci presented a balanced distribution among fragment size groups:  <dig> loci  exhibited small fragment sizes  and  <dig> loci  largest fragment size , with all remaining fragments 125–299 bp. this dataset complies with the technical recommendation to avoid an imbalanced number of loci per primer-combination and an excessive proportion of loci of small fragment size, thus reducing potential for peak size homoplasy  <cit> .

population clustering analysis
structure  <cit>  analysis of all  <dig> female mosquitoes analysed for the  <dig> loci indicated an optimum of two clusters . division into the two clusters closely matched the previous form-identification used to select the mosquito samples . however, eight individuals previously identified as molestus  presented an individual assignment inferior to  <dig>  for this cluster . principal component analysis  performed by genalex  <dig>   <cit>  confirmed the division between the two forms and the placement of the eight previously-identified molestus females closer to pipiens form individuals . these eight individuals were excluded from the subsequent analysis owing to the conflicting classification between the aflp data and the other identification methods.fig.  <dig> bayesian cluster analysis conducted by structure  <cit> . a analysis with the eight populations of cx. pipiens s.s.

the average probability of membership  obtained by the structure varied among geographic samples. in pipiens samples, the uk sample showed a higher av.qi  than the chicago  sample  and comporta  samples . in the molestus form, portuguese samples displayed lower av.qi  than the chicago  sample . the consistently lower av.qi in portuguese samples suggests a higher degree of admixture than in the other geographic samples.

clustering analysis was also performed within each form separately; both analyses indicated a division into two clusters, which split chicago samples from european samples, within each form . pca supported the geographic  division within molestus  and pipiens , with european samples of each form comprising a single group but the samples from chicago  separated from all the other samples. a neighbour-joining tree based on fst values supported the division between the forms and also a high differentiation between the european and american samples, especially in the molestus form .fig.  <dig> unrooted neighbour-joining tree based on f

diversity estimates were calculated for each population by the aflp-surv  <cit>  . no significant differences were found between pipiens and molestus forms in number of polymorphic loci , and the proportion of polymorphic loci at the 5 % level .

for almost every measurement of fst intra-form comparisons were consistently higher between usa and europe than among populations within europe . between pipiens and molestus forms, fst values were higher between the usa samples than in any intercontinental comparison between europe and usa . inter-form comparisons between european samples yielded lower fst values than usa  and intercontinental comparisons .

in  <dig> out of  <dig> comparisons involving the usa molestus sample higher fst values were found in intra-form comparisons than in inter-form comparisons with european samples . the high divergence found between intercontinental samples of molestus is illustrated in the neighbour-joining tree .

detecting outlier loci
due to the marked genetic structure between american and european samples, the detection of outlier loci was performed separately for each continent. results of the outlier analysis performed using three different approaches among all the european population samples  and within each form in europe  are shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file 1: fig. s <dig> fig.  <dig> outlier detection results from bayescan  <cit>  analyses of european populations. n: number of samples; black asterisks: non-outlier loci  <  <dig> ); blue triangle: outlier loci within form analysis  ≥  <dig> ); red dot: outlier loci between pipiens and molestus  ≥  <dig>  only for all populations outlier analysis). note that logarithm of posterior odds to base  <dig> ) is arbitrarily fixed to  <dig> when the posterior probability is  <dig> 



in europe, a total of  <dig> loci  were scored as outliers across the three methods performed by bayescan  <dig>   <cit>  and mcheza  <cit> . however, this number varied among the methods and only six out of the  <dig> outlier loci were detected consistently by all methods: mix1d2_ <dig>  mix3d4_ <dig>  mix4d2_ <dig>  mix4d3_ <dig>  mix4d4_ <dig>  and mix4d4_ <dig> .fig.  <dig> number of loci detected as outliers in europe and usa by each method and replicated as outliers in multiple methods. bs: bayescan with binary code  <cit> ; bs bayescan with amplification intensity matrix  <cit> ; mcheza: mcheza with binary code  <cit> ; n: number of samples



mcheza detected  <dig>  loci as outliers between the molestus and pipiens samples from chicago  but neither of the approaches implemented by bayescan detected any outliers . of the  <dig> total outlier loci found either in europe or in usa, only two , mix3d4_ <dig>  and mix4d4_ <dig> , were found consistently across both continents .

however, usa samples exhibited only half the number of scored polymorphic loci  compared with european samples. in fact, for six of the within-europe outliers  no positive band was detected in the usa samples, precluding its inclusion in the usa analysis. this drastic reduction of polymorphic loci in the usa data set led to a higher proportion of small-sized loci  that significantly changed the loci distribution among fragment size groups when compared with the original .

discussion
in this study, a rigorously quality-controlled aflp procedure was applied to understand the nature of differentiation within and between pipiens and molestus forms of culex pipiens from two continents. this genome-wide aflp scan provides additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that molestus and pipiens forms correspond to evolutionarily distinct entities  <cit> . independent of geographic origin, molestus samples clustered together and were genetically distinct from pipiens samples highlighting a common ancestry between european and usa molestus populations. this result was consistent in all analyses of population structure conducted. in addition to the molestus/pipiens partitioning, population sub-structuring was found between continents within each form.

inter-continental differentiation was higher within the molestus than the pipiens form, possibly due to two factors. 1) colonization of an underground habitat by the usa molestus population studied . this may have increased genetic drift associated with founder effects/bottlenecks. high differentiation has also been observed between natural populations of molestus in chicago and new york  <cit> . 2) laboratory colonization of the samples analysed and their maintenance for  <dig> years is very likely to have inflated differentiation compared to that expected among equivalent natural source populations. however, the molestus form presents ecological traits more adaptable to laboratory conditions  when compared with the pipiens form, which theoretically could lead to higher differentiation in pipiens than molestus when the laboratory colonies were created. therefore, the highest differentiation observed for the molestus sample of chicago  may have resulted from the additive effect of underground habitat colonization that isolated this population and the subsequent laboratory colony establishment/maintenance .

multilocus screening by aflp is able to identify candidate loci linked to adaptive genetic variation  that may be associated with mechanisms of selection and species adaptation  <cit> . the anonymous random information of aflp does not allow determining the distribution of outlier loci in the genome but this technique is able to identify consistent signals among geographic populations and estimate the proportion of outlier loci in the genome. on average, the percentage of loci scored as outliers in incipient species comparisons varies between  <dig> and 10 % . thus, outlier rates between pipiens and molestus appear to be relatively low with  <dig>  %  of loci outlying in comparisons among european samples and  <dig>  %  between usa samples, with the latter actually being  <dig>  % if it is considered that only half as many markers were scored in usa samples .

such outlier rates are comparable to those obtained using a snp-chip  to compare the genomes of the m and s molecular forms of the malaria vector anopheles gambiae s.s. , from guinea-bissau  <cit> . interestingly, the proportion of outlier loci found in guinea-bissau, an area of exceptionally high hybridisation, was much lower than from inter-form comparisons in ghana and cameroon, where gene flow is much lower  <cit> . similarity between the outlier rates found in the present analysis in europe  and guinea-bissau  might be expected since both included the analysis of sympatric mosquito populations with elevated hybridization  <cit> . estimates below the average have also been found in other sympatric populations of closely related insects with gene flow  <cit> .

the low genomic divergence in europe between pipiens and molestus forms  and the lower av.qi in portuguese samples that indicate a higher background noise in pipiens than molestus samples are consistent with a pattern of asymmetric introgression from molestus into pipiens  <cit>  previously observed in two distinct geographical areas  of southern europe with similar landscapes . gomes et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that this pattern could be promoted by differences in mating strategies between the cx. pipiens s.s. forms: stenogamous molestus males  and eurygamous pipiens males . in fact, indoor mating has been associated with a breakdown of assortative mating between molecular forms of an. gambiae  <cit> .

the similar outlier rates of usa and europe inter-form analysis contrast with the higher fst estimates found in usa inter-form comparisons  than european inter-form comparisons . this low outlier rates in usa may be explained by form-specific signal lost in the molestus sample of chicago  due to founder effects and genetic drift in their colony establishment and maintenance, a phenomenon previously observed in anopheles spp. laboratory colonies  <cit> . this pattern is also consistent with high intra/inter-form differentiation observed in colony and field collected molestus of chicago  <cit>  suggesting that underground colonization may have played a role in this divergence pattern.

when the two inter-form outlier analyses  were compared, only two loci , mix3d4_ <dig> and mix4d4_ <dig>  were found with a consistent outlier signal in both europe and usa. these loci are likely to be associated with genomic regions involved in ecological speciation and/or in the adaptation to anthropogenic habitats by the molestus form. the capacity of molestus to occupy underground habitats associated with humans, such as subways, sewers and caves  <cit> , has been promoted by stenogamy and autogeny, which allow a continuous existence in confined habitats with low availability of blood meal sources. these traits are retained even when the molestus form coexists with the pipiens form in aboveground habitats, such as in the case of comporta, portugal  <cit> . likewise, there was a tendency for molestus individuals to occupy aboveground indoor habitats in this region  <cit> . in mosquitoes, habitat segregation has been considered a major factor underlying the divergence between the m and s forms of an. gambiae s.s.  <cit> . ecological postmating barriers are expected to act against maladapted hybrids in the alternate m versus s larval habitats  <cit> . moreover, autogeny and overwintering diapause are ecological traits essential to survive under non-ideal conditions  that may lead to energetic costs  <cit> . these two ecological traits may play an important role in ecological postmating barriers acting against maladapted hybrids of cx. pipiens s.s. forms.

CONCLUSIONS
this study supports the status of the molestus and pipiens forms as distinct evolutionary entities with low genomic divergence that are likely to be in a process of incipient speciation. however, the anonymous information  given by aflp screening makes identification of genomic regions, genes, and mutations involved in the adaptation and speciation process difficult  <cit> . further studies focusing on additional natural populations of cx. pipiens forms, using higher resolution genomic scans with high-throughput technologies are required in order to fully understand the genomic patterns in cx. pipiens s.s. and identify processes that may be involved in the incipient speciation and habitat adaptation of pipiens and molestus forms.
