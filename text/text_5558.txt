BACKGROUND
johne's disease  is caused by the intracellular pathogen, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis . several molecular techniques have been applied to differentiate and characterize map isolates from diverse hosts and geographic locations  <cit> . a recent study applied highly discriminatory molecular markers termed short sequence repeats  to analyze the diversity among map isolates from a variety of hosts  <cit> . the results provided evidence for interspecies transmission of several map genotypes with some showing host specificity. intriguingly, all genotyping studies addressing diversity using a variety of methods show that map isolated from human crohn's disease cases are a subset of map genotypes widespread in distribution among animal populations. these findings raise several questions regarding the association of specific genotypes with human disease and/or chronic sub-clinical versus overt clinical disease in animals. since no information on disease phenotypes was obtained when the isolates were acquired for genotyping in our laboratory, logical interpretation of genotype-phenotype associations was not possible. in the absence of clinical data associated with genotypes, and a suitable animal model to rapidly identify strain-associated differences, studying map interactions in a cellular  interphase provides an indirect tool to help dissect the early molecular events that occur during host-pathogen interactions.

despite the fact that hosts have only a limited number of pathways in which they respond to pathogens, macrophages show both pathogen-specific gene expression profiles and a shared gene expression pattern when infected with diverse bacterial pathogens  <cit> . an in vitro study of human macrophage responses to a repertoire of genotypically and epidemiologically well defined clinical isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis  showed a strain dependent host response  <cit> . a more recent study has shown a shared and a unique gene expression signature by human macrophages stimulated with four isolates of m. avium that varied in growth characteristics  <cit> . significant differences in cytokine-chemokine profiles or global gene expression profiles in either well-established cell lines  or peripheral blood mononuclear cells  in response to diverse pathogenic and non pathogenic mycobacteria, have also been documented by several recent studies  <cit> . taken together, available data in the current literature strongly suggests that macrophages infected with mycobacteria have differential gene expression profiles and that the infecting genotypes may dictate down stream host responses. surprisingly, there have been no reports so far about comparative analyses of diverse clinical isolates of map within a host/host macrophage, which is a well established fact in other mycobacteria. we believe that this crucial piece of evidence is important in order to understand complex mechanisms underlying the virulence of this economically important pathogen.

towards these long term goals, in this study we asked if genotypically distinct strains of map derived from different host species elicit differential responses in bovine monocyte derived macrophages. to test our hypothesis that there would be no strain-specific variation in host responses, we studied the growth kinetics of genotypically distinct strains of map in both bomac cells  <cit>  and bovine monocyte derived macrophages . we compared the modulation of cytokines such as il- <dig>  tnfα and matrix metalloproteinase  genes such as mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> as a function of infecting genotype. the importance of these cytokines in jd has been reported elsewhere  <cit> . cytokines il- <dig> and tnfα were evaluated because the relative balance in expression of these cytokines indicates macrophage activation. pbmcs isolated from cattle infected with jd have been shown to up regulate mmp <dig> and timp after stimulation with map  <cit> . mmps when secreted in lower quantities help in leukocyte migration but when secreted in larger quantities cause tissue destruction  <cit> . a balance between mmp and timp is important in the extent of tissue degradation  <cit> . in summary, in this study we report a differential response of bovine monocyte derived macrophages to a variety of map isolates.

RESULTS
intracellular survival kinetics of map strains
b <dig>  was efficiently phagocytosed by bovine mdms and persisted at fairly high numbers when compared to other isolates at all time points . s <dig>  decreased in bacterial numbers until 24-hr pi, started to multiply by 48-hr pi and dropped in total intracellular bacterial numbers by 96-hr pi. hu <dig>  declined in numbers until 16-hr post infection and began replicating until 48-hr after infection and started to drop until 96-hr pi. m. avium showed a persistent trend until  <dig> hrs after infection of mdms and replicated thereafter, until  <dig> hrs post infection.

in bomac cells s <dig> multiplied more rapidly and stayed in higher numbers at  <dig> hr pi relative to b <dig>  however, in bovine mdm cells b <dig> was efficiently internalized and stayed in higher numbers relative to s <dig> and hu <dig> map isolates .

il- <dig> expression profile
as intracellular bacteria began replication , mdms stimulated with bovine  and human  map isolates up-regulated il- <dig> mrna  and protein  levels over the entire infection period and this peaked from 48-hr to 96-hr pi. there was a positive correlation between il- <dig> mrna gene expression and il- <dig> protein secretion  observed in the cells stimulated with b <dig> and hu <dig>  cells stimulated with s <dig> and m. avium down regulated il- <dig> mrna by 96-hr pi . cells stimulated with m. avium showed a gradual increase in il- <dig> protein secretion until 48-hr pi and started to drop until 96-hr pi . interestingly, cells stimulated with s <dig> showed a sustained increase in il- <dig> protein secretion until 96-hr pi .

tnfα expression profile
mdms stimulated with b <dig> and hu <dig> isolates showed a down regulatory trend in tnfα mrna expression from 2-hr to 48-hr pi that switched course to an up-regulatory trend from 48-hr until 96-hr pi . cells stimulated with b <dig> gradually up-regulated tnfα protein secretion from 2-hr until 48-hr pi that dropped thereafter . cells stimulated with hu <dig> increased tnfα protein secretion until 24-hr pi that showed a down-regulatory trend until 96-hr pi . cells stimulated with s <dig> up-regulated tnfα mrna and protein levels by 96-hr pi . at 96-hr pi, the magnitude of tnfα mrna and protein level was significantly lower  in cells stimulated with b <dig> relative to cell stimulations by s <dig>  hu <dig> and m. avium . although, cells stimulated with m. avium down regulated tnfα protein secretion from 16-hr until 96-hr pi, the amount of protein detected was significantly higher  relative to other stimulations .

mmp <dig> mrna expression
mdms stimulated with b <dig> increased the production of mmp <dig> mrna at 16-hr which was followed by a rapid decline until  <dig> hrs pi . cells stimulated with s <dig> produced a peak level of mmp <dig> at 24-hr that declined by 96-hr. while mmp <dig> mrna production by cells stimulated with b <dig> was high at 16-hr relative to cells stimulated by s <dig> and hu <dig>  the data was not statistically significant . at 24-hr there was a significant increase  in the production of mmp <dig> mrna by cells stimulated with s <dig> relative to other stimulations. there was a gradual up-regulation of mmp <dig> mrna production by mdms stimulated with hu <dig> until  <dig> hrs and declined by 96-hr.

mmp <dig> mrna expression
cells stimulated with b <dig> showed lower levels of mmp <dig> mrna production at 48-hr and 96-hr pi relative to cell stimulations with other map isolates . cells stimulated with s <dig> had a peak mmp <dig> mrna production at 48-hr after infection, which was significantly higher  when compared with stimulations by other map isolates . cells stimulated with hu <dig> also showed an up-regulatory trend in mmp <dig> mrna production until 96-hr . cells stimulated with hu <dig> had significantly  low mmp <dig> mrna levels relative to cells stimulated with s <dig> at 24-hr and 48-hr pi .

timp <dig> mrna expression
lsmean values of timp <dig> mrna levels suggested that mdms stimulated with b <dig> showed higher levels relative to cell stimulations by s <dig>  . there was a peak production of timp <dig> mrna observed at 96-hr in mdms stimulated with b <dig> .

discussion
macrophages are the first line of host defense against any invading bacteria. despite the fact that macrophages offer a hostile environment to several pathogenic bacteria, map is able to persistently survive and replicate within the phagosome environment of host macrophages. studying the biochemical processes operating at the host-pathogen interface will help elucidate the mechanisms by which map has developed expertise to survive and replicate inside macrophages. over the years many researchers have employed techniques such as microarray, semi-quantitative pcr, q-rt-pcr to study the gene expression profiles in a cellular model after infection with pathogenic mycobacteria including type strains of map  <cit> . however, a possible map genotype-disease phenotype association has not been established despite the evidence that there is diversity in the genotypes of map strains isolated from several different hosts  <cit> .

in the absence of a well characterized experimental animal model to study host pathogen interactions of map in jd, cellular models have served as a helpful surrogate to researchers  <cit> . while bomac cells provide an easy to use immortalized cell line to study host-pathogen interactions, our studies with this cell line support earlier observations by sager et al.  <cit>  further highlighting that this bovine monocytoid cell line may differ in their behavior compared with mdms. thus, we chose to characterize map strain dependent host response only in bovine mdm cells.

bovine monocyte derived macrophages infected with map have been previously employed to study changes in cytokine profiles  <cit> . in the present study we have demonstrated a map genotype dependent phenotype characterized by differences in the cytokine profiles such as il- <dig>  tnfα and mmps in mdms. the importance of il- <dig> and tnfα in jd has been reported elsewhere  <cit> . il- <dig> inhibits macrophage activation and is one of the major anti inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . tnfα is a major inflammatory cytokine produced by activated macrophages and is involved in controlling bacterial replication  <cit> .

our results based on the data generated using mdm cells obtained from two different animals consistently showed that b <dig>  efficiently entered and remained in higher numbers within mdm cells relative to other map isolates. cells stimulated with b <dig> up-regulated expression of il- <dig> mrna  while expression of tnfα mrna was down-regulated relative to other map isolates. this was also evident in the relatively low proteins identified in the culture supernatant. previous studies also reported a similar phenotype for the atcc  <dig> strain of map in bovine macrophages  <cit> . khaleifh et. al  <cit>  reported an up regulatory pattern of il- <dig> secretion in bovine macrophages following infection with a type strain of map which is consistent with our findings, although the magnitude of up regulation at the protein level was much lower compared with their il- <dig> levels. when compared to b <dig>  hu <dig> and s <dig> strains significantly down regulated il- <dig> mrna and up regulated tnfα mrna. mdms stimulated with s <dig> and hu <dig> map strains had significantly high amounts  of tnfα and il- <dig> secreted into culture supernatants relative to b <dig> strain. a similar proinflammatory response by dendritic cells to whole cell map  infection has been recently demonstrated  <cit> . the study also documented that stimulation of dendritic cells by a recombinant immunodominant antigen of map included severe anti-inflammatory responses invoking the hypothesis that the differential in macrophage responses seen in our study may have occurred due to differences in expression of specific virulence genes by the strains studied. our studies with ssr analysis  <cit>  and snp analysis  suggest that specific genotypes may be associated with subclinical disease while others may lead to clinically overt disease. additionally, in vitro analysis of map survival within primary macrophage cells in the present study show clear distinction in entry, survival and persistence as a function of genotypes. dna microarray analysis of the genome content of map isolates employed in this study using maa <dig> array revealed that several large sequence polymorphisms  were missing in s <dig> when compared to b <dig> . while this may explain the variations between sheep  and bovine  isolates, the variations in host response to bovine  or human  genotypes of map may exist in snps and/or variations in bacterial gene regulation within the host. confirmation of this finding will require analysis of a larger genotypically diverse collection for both host and pathogen gene expression. comparisons of infections with a type strain of map and m. avium avium in bovine mdms have revealed an increased expression of tnfα in cells infected with m. avium avium and a down regulation of il- <dig>  <cit> . the m. avium intracellulare strain employed in our study showed similar trends in tnfα production when compared to other map strains studied. however, an increased il- <dig> level was detected in culture supernatants infected with m. avium intracellulare compared to other strains at 96-hr pi. the differences observed could be because the m. avium intracellulare strain utilized in this study was unique in that this strain carried is <dig>  an insertion element that was once considered unique to map.

matrix metalloproteinases  are a family of calcium-dependent proteinases  <cit>  involved in cell migration, tissue remodeling and destruction. tissue inhibitors of mmp  inhibit the activity of mmp. a balance between mmp and timp produced at the site of inflammation influences the ability of immune cells to migrate and the amount of tissue destruction caused  <cit> . pbmcs isolated from cattle infected with jd have been documented to up-regulate mmp <dig> and timp after stimulation with map  <cit> . mmp and timp are reported to play a functional role in infections caused by pathogenic mycobacteria  <cit> . in our study, cells stimulated with b <dig> down-regulated mmp <dig> while up-regulating timp <dig> production relative to mdms stimulated with hu <dig> and s <dig> strains. this is consistent with the idea that these map genotypes  lead to an anti-inflammatory and anti-invasive milieu allowing their persistence and survival within macrophages. thp- <dig> cells infected with mtb have shown significant production of mmp <dig> and timp <dig> but not mmp <dig>  <cit> . mmp <dig> when secreted at low levels aid leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. however, in large amounts, mmp <dig> causes tissue destruction  <cit> . it has also been shown that tnfα production at the site of inflammation correlates with mmp <dig> production  <cit> . our observations are consistent with the idea that s <dig> strain may elicit a relatively more invasive pathway during infection. taken together, our studies demonstrate a map genotype-dependent response in a bovine monocyte derived macrophage model.

CONCLUSIONS
the present findings provide key insights into the map genotype-disease phenotype associations. further analysis of this complex "ancient dialogue" between map and macrophages derived from its natural host  will help elucidate the pathogenesis associated with different genotypes isolated from diverse host species. these studies will aid in understanding the proximal events involved in the progression of jd and the virulence of map isolates thus enabling design of early intervention strategies. future studies with a broader range of map isolates with common and unique genotypes associated with jd are warranted.
