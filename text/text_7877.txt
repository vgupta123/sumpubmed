BACKGROUND
genome analysis is improved and becomes more meaningful when one considers genome context, pathway context and metabolic reconstruction. a focus on the prediction of encoded proteins and establishing links to experimentally characterized protein sequences from other organisms is particularly important in organisms where there has been characterized mainly the genome sequence. examples are obligate intracellular endosymbionts where direct experimental identification of their proteins is very challenging. as a case in point we analyze the genome sequence from the endosymbiont blochmannia floridanus, an obligate intracellular endosymbiont of ants of the genus camponotus. such symbioses between insects and bacteria are widespread in nature and the endosymbionts are of high importance for their hosts with implications for pest control. blochmannia floridanus, buchnera and wigglesworthia bacteria provide important nutrients to their insect host  <cit>  and live in intimate metabolic contact  <cit>  with the host as intracellular organisms in specialised cells, bacteriocytes  <cit> . the diet of the ant is not as specialized as those of aphids and tsetse flies, the hosts of buchnera and wigglesworthia, respectively, implicating specific metabolic capabilities in blochmannia  <cit> . however, endosymbiotic genomes are experiencing a steady reduction as the intracellular symbionts live in a constant intracellular environment. the recent genome sequence of blochmannia floridanus  <cit>  allowed first insights in its biochemistry and life style. however, important functions of the proteins encoded in the genome remained uncertain  or could not yet be recognized  and are the focus of this study.

the continuous growth of sequence data together with modern sequence alignment algorithms allow to detect homologies to well characterized proteins from other species which have been overlooked by previous efforts. any pathway in blochmannia floridanus has to be sufficiently complete to fulfil its biological function . furthermore, the full genome sequence of blochmannia floridanus is known. all these factors help in genome-wide sequence comparisons to identify a missing enzyme activity for a blochmannia floridanus pathway. comparisons of the pathway completeness with other species and biochemical data further refine such a "pathway alignment"  <cit> . two more complete pathways obtained here for blochmannia floridanus are shown in the figures .

genome context methods are a further independent method to deduce sequence function  <cit> . clearly, genes which are together in an operon are linked by the common function of the operon. this helps to assign function to sequences in such operons. comparing co-occurrence or common absence of gene sets in different genomes further enhances this: if an unknown gene is always present with a set of known genes its function is associated with this set of known genes. furthermore, we could show that proteins found in several prokaryotic genomes to be encoded by neighbouring genes tend to interact with each other  <cit> . if in one genome such neighbouring reading frames are found to be fused, this is an even stronger indication that the encoded proteins interact . when many genomes are compared in this way for the conservation and variation of genes, genome order and fusion, the method becomes quite powerful  <cit> . thus we used for this type of predictions a recent version of the database string which compares more than  <dig> genomes for these various criteria and includes in addition experimental and text mining data on protein-protein interactions.

combining these different methods allowed a number of new sequence assignments. error thresholds and combination criteria are indicated in the materials and methods section.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> genes and of these 583protein-coding genes are present in the blochmannia genome. according to the recently published complete genome sequence  <cit> ,  <dig> are conserved hypothetical proteins and in this way their assignment points to functions occurring in other species, either other endosymbionts or more general ones. another protein encoded in the genome was considered hypothetical, presumably species specific and of unknown function but is now found to be present also in other genomes and to be involved in transcription . furthermore  <dig> proteins had only a putative function assignment. these different proteins and their encoding gene sequences were analyzed using various bioinformatical tools .

proteins with previous putative function assignments
for the proteins encoded in the complete genome which were termed „putative", we first checked whether we could either further confirm or more solidly describe their function by the additional experimental and bioinformatical data gathered in databases and genomes since the first annotation. furthermore we investigated with detailed sequence analysis these putative proteins whether we could find more information about their molecular function either by specific motif searches  or by establishing links  to experimentally well characterized protein sequences in other genomes.

additional file  <dig> shows that using sequence to sequence comparisons, an informative assignment with high confidence  on the molecular function  of  <dig> proteins could be made and for  <dig> proteins there remained only minor uncertainties on the molecular function despite the low e-value of their sequence assignment . for  <dig> proteins there is still only a putative function assignment possible and for one protein no  prediction is possible. furthermore, in all the cases categorized as "good" and most of those categorized as "fair" the function could also be supported by several methods and databases we used . these allowed to clarify the function of the blochmannia floridanus sequence and established strong links to experimental well characterized protein sequences.

the revised cellular and molecular functions of  <dig> putative proteins are summarized in additional file  <dig>  two pseudo-genes were not included. as an example, bfl <dig> protein can now be assigned by sequence similarity to the rmuc family. experimentally well characterized proteins encoded by this family are involved in limiting inversions . furthermore, the sequences of these proteins show limited homology to myosins and to some of the smc  proteins  <cit> .

pathway additions from the previous putative proteins
nothing in a genome makes sense if not considered and validated by its interrelations and context  <cit> . to validate our predictions further and to confirm them in the light of previously recognized functions of encoded proteins, we considered the genome and metabolic context  of the re-analyzed previously putative proteins. the following pathways thus emerge for blochmannia:

bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , bfl <dig>  and bfl <dig>  are all predicted to be involved in the inositol pathway . a further component of this pathway and confirmed in this assignment by the kegg database is bfl <dig>  which would be a putative myo-inositol-1-monophosphatase related to the archaeal fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase and related enzymes of inositol monophosphatase family.

furthermore, we could assemble the following enzymes for vitamin b synthesis: bfl <dig>  is involved with erythronate-4-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphoserine aminotransferase , threonine synthase , pyridoxal phosphate biosynthetic protein pdxa , pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase . this addition to the original annotation has also been confirmed by the kegg database.

regarding nitrogen metabolism, we were able to confirm that the encoded proteins bfl <dig>  bfl <dig> and bfl <dig> annotated previously as putative  <cit>  build an urease complex . furthermore, there are bfl <dig>  bfl <dig> and bfl <dig> to build an accessory complex , which activates the urease  <cit> . moreover, to utilize the produced ammonia for l-glutamine production, glutamine synthetase is present in blochmannia . besides protein synthesis, the amino-group of glutamine can be used for synthesis of other amino acids in host and symbiont as well as for aminosugars and nucleotides. however, there is no functional glutaminase known in the blochmannia genome. we only found the conserved region of glutaminases to have low similarity to bfl <dig>  furthermore, there is ferredoxin . a conserved hypothetical protein  with a nifu domain is probably involved in nitrogen utilization in nitrogen fixing bacteria and plants. however, we suggest that in blochmannia it supplies a redox-activity  involved in nitrogen utilization.

bfl <dig>  is predicted by us to be involved in the ubiquinone pathway. potential interaction partners from the genome could be a series of proteins: bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyl transferase , 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase , ubiquinone biosynthesis protein , 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxyphenol hydroxylase , ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis methyltransferase ubie , putative monooxygenase , 3-demethylubiquinone- <dig> 3-methyltransferase ; all these functional associations are not only suggested by interaction analysis applying the string software, but are also supported by the kegg database comparing different proteobacteria.

the putative methyltransferase bfl <dig> is furthermore predicted to be involved in amino acid metabolism .

several of the putative proteins we identified to be transporters. these could be confirmed in their main function , using hmmer searches from the respective transporter families on the whole proteom . nevertheless the suggested substrate specificity still needs further experimental confirmation: bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> , bfl <dig> .

though there are several transporters, the hmmer searches confirmed that there is only one channel in the blochmannia genome: bfl <dig>  a membrane protein.

previously conserved hypothetical proteins
we used sequence, domain and gene context analysis  to further elucidate the function of the genome encoded  <dig> conserved hypothetical and the one previous hypothetical protein. their conservation in several genomes further supports the functional importance of these reading frames. furthermore, we tried to establish links  to experimentally better characterized protein sequences from other genomes. moreover, for some predicted proteins, there are links to experimental data available using homologous structures from structural genomics projects, e.g. for bfl <dig> and bfl <dig> 

the following predicted proteins remained nevertheless unclear: bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  however, recent data by doerks et al.  <cit>  suggest functions for the previously uncharacterized proteins encoded by the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins cog <dig> and cog <dig>  bfl <dig> protein is similar to the sequences encoded in the cluster cog <dig> which suggests for bfl <dig> having a functional participation in protein biosynthesis. bfl <dig> is similar to the sequences encoded in cog <dig>  and for the proteins encoded by cog <dig> a functional participation in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis is predicted.

for the remaining proteins, sequence comparisons allowed to assign them to specific protein families. we relied only on well described protein families described in high quality protein databases such as the databases cog  <cit> , pfam  <cit>  and go  <cit> . for some proteins, direct predictions from sequence analysis were possible such as prediction of transmembrane helices and specific residues or protein motifs. additional file  <dig> summarizes these different predictions. proteins encoded by the blochmannia genes bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig> and bfl <dig> were assigned to specific protein families. these functions, predicted by screening for most similar protein sequences using the sequence alignment algorithm blast  <cit>  and the non redundant database at the ncbi, could further be confirmed by predicted functions according to the databases cog and pfam. those encoded from the two genes bfl <dig> and bfl <dig> could initially only be assigned to their functional categories combining these different resources.

further we have been able to assign putative new functions by additional sequence and domain analysis for the following eleven previously conserved hypothetical proteins: bfl <dig> is probably an organic solvent tolerance protein. its sequence is similar to the entry cog <dig> of the cog database where no function is assigned. further sequence comparisons indicated then that the region 34– <dig> is significantly similar  to the osta protein from e.coli. in e.coli recent experimental data show  <cit>  that the osta protein is known as an organic solvent tolerance protein and so this prediction for blochmannia was derived. similarly, bfl <dig> should have transcription regulator activity  and there should be methyltransferase activity for bfl <dig> protein . sequence analysis finds a hes-b like domain in bfl <dig> . this may indicate a potential function in nitrogen metabolism. bfl <dig> may be a dsrna binding protein ; a nudix domain points to a hydrolase activity for bfl264; the protein bfl <dig> is probably involved in fe-s metabolism and export , bfl <dig> has electron transporter activity ; bfl <dig> is predicted to contain a zn-dependent hydrolase ; for bfl <dig> one can predict an o-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase activity , and a metalloendopeptidase activity for bfl <dig>  interestingly, the last protein contains a transmembrane domain .

in a third step, the following proteins were examined in more detail to suggest specific molecular or cellular functions:

bfl <dig>  of previously unknown function  <cit>  is a member of a cluster of orthologous genes . sequence analysis allows the following predictions on its function: the protein is predicted to contain a domain with a transmembrane region , three low complexity regions  and a coiled-coil region . more specifically, according to the pfam database, the protein sequence can be placed into the duf <dig> family. the function assignment of the duf <dig> family is not clear in the pfam database. however, considering the transmembrane domain prediction and suggested string predictions  both the yersinia and the blochmannia protein are putative membrane proteins. predicted associations of the q8zb <dig> yersinia protein further involve a putative exported protein and an adenylate cyclase. this putative function assignment for bfl <dig> is further supported by interactions known for the corresponding e.coli proteins. therefore we suggest here that bfl <dig> functions as a periplasmic membrane protein.

bfl <dig>  contains a hesb-like domain including the prosite pattern. its similarity to known structures allows a structure prediction applying swiss-model .

the exact function of bfl <dig>  was earlier described as unknown  <cit> . we now suggest that bfl <dig> protein functions as a septum formation initiator. clusters of orthologous genes  confirm the septum formation initiator function by looking what is known about the function for orthologous genes of ybgq in other genomes. thus the homology to the yersinia pestis protein sequence supports the finding that this is with high probability a cell division ftsb protein  homolog. further analysis by sequence comparison finds an amino-terminal coiled-coil domain according to the pfam database. moreover, a septum formation initiator domain is predicted for the regions  <dig> to  <dig> of the bfl <dig> protein by the conserved domain server. we note that in blochmannia several further fts proteins are predicted to be present : ftsj  and fts a,h,k,l,i,q,w and z. the pathway for cell division is only sufficiently complete to allow cell division if also fts b is present  and thus this function prediction also closes a gap in an otherwise incomplete pathway in blochmannia.

for the bfl <dig> protein  the functional assignment is a putative translation factor. the gene encoding the yeast homolog sua <dig> was identified as a suppressor of a translation initiation defect in cytochrome c and is required for normal growth in yeast. the sequence homology of bfl <dig> could be confirmed by sequence similarity using different algorithms and databanks as well as by the functional associations predicted for other yrdc proteins. moreover, in our structure prediction for bfl <dig>  the protein features a large concave surface on one side that exhibits a positive electrostatic potential. the authors of the e.coli structure suggested that the fold plays a role in double-stranded rna binding  <cit> .

bfl <dig> protein  was also assigned with an "unknown" function  <cit> . it was described as a conserved hypothetical protein and with cog category s  which is in line with the pfam and interpro  function assignment. with the growth of function assignment in the cog database cog <dig> yields now the putative function assignment fe-s cluster protection protein. further sequence analysis supports this. the sequence  has homology to the pirsf <dig> family, the fe trafficking protein yggx. the protein represented by this family, yggx, serves to protect fe-s clusters from oxidative damage  <cit> . the effect is two-fold in that the proteins which rely on fe-s clusters do not become inactivated, and the release of free iron and hydrogen peroxide – a dna damaging agent – is prevented. these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that yggx chelates free iron, and recent experiments show that yggx can indeed bind fe in vitro and in vivo in salmonella enterica  <cit> . furthermore, yggx has a positive effect on the action of at least one fe-responsive protein. the combined actions of yggx is reminiscent of iron trafficking proteins and yggx is therefore proposed to play a role in fe trafficking. in escherichia coli, yggx was shown to be under the transcriptional control of the redox-sensing soxrs system  <cit> , which is absent in blochmannia.

bfl <dig>  is a ntp pyrophosphohydrolase confirmed also by data from pfam and prosite. such activities are found in oxidative damage repair enzymes. no potential interactions could be predicted for the protein. structural homology allows to predict its structure using the solution structure of the nudix enzyme diadenosine 5',5"'-p <dig>  p4-tetraphosphate hydrolase from lupinus angustifolius as the modelling template .

bfl <dig>  was previously classified as functionally unknown . function prediction of a cog with previously unknown function profits from any experimental evidence for the function found in orthologous genes in other genomes. in the time after the original publication  <cit>  of the blochmannia floridanus genome sequence, it was revealed for the cog <dig> that such genes encode probably a metal-dependent hydrolase . independently, from the database prodom the sequence is predicted to be a metalloenzyme. according to the database pfam it has the upf <dig> signature with three conserved histidines at the c terminus. in the latter database, all upf protein family members have unclear function. however, the signature shows which residues are important in this family, in this case the three histidines at the c-terminus. taking the information from cog database, prodom and pfam together predicts for bfl <dig> already that it is a metalloenzyme, a hydrolase requiring the metal for catalysis and having three functional important and conserved histidines at the c-terminus. in the course of a structural genomics project on aquifex aeolicus the a. aeolicus protein orthologous to bfl <dig> was crystallized. its structure was solved, though its function was not yet known. this allowed us to obtain  a homology model for bfl <dig> using this a.aeolicus structure as a template. its predicted structure is shown in figure  <dig> . the rmsd to the template structure 1oz <dig> is  <dig>  Å. as the analysis above now gives an indication for its putative function, we offer now both structure information and the putative function for this protein. furthermore, there is even a prediction possible for a potential interaction partner of this blochmannia protein. gene context analysis using the string database  suggests the functional association of bfl <dig> with the phoh-like protein . we have to stress that each of these prediction types relies on independent methods and several databases were independently used. furthermore, the string prediction does not only look at the operon context of blochmannia but makes an estimate and prediction for functional association and interactions comparing well over  <dig> genomes, most of them prokaryotic.

bfl <dig>  was also annotated with unknown function  <cit> . it was originally described as a conserved hypothetical protein with cog <dig> and cog category r . with the growth of the cog database one can now infer that the protein clusters into the 3-carboxymuconate cyclases and has the new category is g . such an activity would indicate a 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme . muconate lactonizing enzymes  convert cis,cis-muconates to muconolactones in microbes as part of the beta-ketoadipate pathway; some also dehalogenate muconate derivatives of xenobiotic haloaromatics. there are three different mle classes unrelated by evolution, this one belongs to the bacterial cmle with sequence similarity to class ii fumarases and structurally similar to the g protein beta subunit. this allows homology modelling  of bfl <dig>  the predicted structure for the cycloisomerase is a beta-propeller . the rmsd of the bfl <dig> homology model to its template structure 1ri <dig> is  <dig>  Å. however, as the sequence similar ybhe protein from e.coli has just been confirmed by biochemical experiments to be phosphogluconolactonase  in the pentose phosphate cycle  <cit> , we can conclude with more confidence that this should be the same activity in blochmannia.

bfl <dig>  was unknown at the time of the genome annotation. it was declared as a hypothetical protein with cog <dig> and cog category s . now we find that it contains a dna-binding winged-hth domain . this could be confirmed as the protein contains a trans_reg_c domain . c-terminally  a transmembrane helix is present. taken together these results suggest that this protein may switch on and off transcription in response to a further signal, which may be a membrane signal detected by the transmembrane domain. there is no receiver domain detectable nor are any two component systems detected as individual components in the blochmannia genome using hmmer search with smart families on the complete genome.

protein bfl <dig>  was described as a conserved hypothetical protein. sequence analysis with searches in current non redundant sequence databases show now that it is a predicted rrna or trna methylase. these could be further confirmed by data from the databanks interpro and tigr. the n-methyltransferase activity, also apparent by comparative genome analysis could either use dna or rna as a substrate, both is possible for this hemk family member . to further support this we find that the sequence is an orthologue of the cog <dig> group of genes which have hemk family as functional annotation of the encoded protein. there is a hemk family member with experimentally solved protein structure in metanococcus jannaschii. this allowed us to obtain  a homology model for bfl <dig>  the predicted structure is shown in figure  <dig> . the rmsd to its template structure 1nv <dig> is  <dig>  Å.

bfl <dig> protein  was unknown . now it can be shown to be an oligoketide cyclase and with this function it may be involved as a lipid transport protein . pfam confirms that it belongs to pfam family pf <dig>  the aromatic-rich protein family. this family may be related to polyketide synthases. the synthesis of polyketides in blochmannia shows a more complex lipid metabolism. in blochmannia, polyketides can furthermore be involved supporting the lipid metabolism in the host, in particular regarding insect hormones.

the phylogenetic distribution of the previously conserved hypothetical proteins is shown in table  <dig>  interestingly, there are no blochmannia specific proteins among them, even the protein bfl <dig> is found in buchnera and wigglesworthia. on the other hand, the conserved hypothetical protein bfl <dig> belongs to a wide-spread family found in many non-proteobacteria. this is also true for the following proteins with some functional assignment: bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig>  bfl <dig> and bfl <dig> 

predicted functional associations and interactions for the previously conserved hypothetical proteins
the tool string  <cit>  allows to predict potential functional associations  for the new annotated proteins by comparison of conserved gene neighbourhood, gene fusion, common absence or presence as well as homology to proteins with experimentally characterized interactions in different bacterial and other genomes. one has to stress that these are only potential associations, which need further experimental confirmation. however, these predictions have been shown to be robust  <cit>  for the delineated functional clusters, genes associated by a common physiological function, even if an individual interaction turns out to be wrong in subsequent experiments. only predicted partners present in the blochmannia genome are considered in the following.

no potential interactions were predicted for the genome encoded proteins bfl <dig> and bfl <dig> 

the periplasmic protein bfl <dig> is associated and may functionally interact with the putative exported proteins bfl <dig> and bfl <dig>  as supported by predictions applying the string tool  <cit> . these conserved proteins are all involved in membrane formation, and may perhaps in this sense also participate in cell division.

the septum initiation formation ftsb-like protein bfl <dig> is tentatively functionally associated with the enzyme bfl <dig>  as well as with the n-methyl-transferase activity for dna and possibly also for rna substrates of bfl <dig>  furthermore it is functionally associated with bfl <dig> protein, for which a function is difficult to assign  and bfl <dig>  an enolase , most probable a 2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase).

functional associations predicted from other genomes suggest also for the bfl <dig> protein a functional involvement in the synthesis of complex sugars and nucleotide synthesis during dna synthesis and cell wall septum initiation in cell division. the neighbouring gene bfl <dig> encodes a dna binding purine specific glycosylase using an iron-sulphur binding domain. this points to an endonuclase iii-like dna glycosidase and a cellular function as a dna repair protein. further functional associations using the string interaction database suggest a function in nucleotide metabolism for bfl <dig>  there are two cellular functions predicted for bfl <dig> protein: bfl <dig> is predicted to be associated with bfl <dig>  the dna polymerase iii delta subunit, the bis-tetraphosphatase of bfl <dig>  as well as with bfl <dig> , the membrane-bound atp synthase f <dig> sector subunit a bfl <dig>  and the trna nucleotidyl-transferase acitivity of bfl <dig> 

the bfl <dig> gene has been considered essential based on its presence in distant reduced genomes, such as proteobacteria and mycoplasma  <cit> . the encoded metal dependent hydrolase bfl <dig> is furthermore predicted to be functionally associated with bfl <dig>  a cytoplasmatic protein and predicted atpase that is induced by phosphate starvation. furthermore, as may be expected from the molecular function of bfl <dig>  it is predicted to be functionally associated with the magnesium and cobalt efflux corc-like transporters bfl <dig> and bfl <dig>  further less strong associations are found for ribosomal proteins l <dig> bfl <dig>  and l <dig>  and the rna polymerase sigma  <dig> domain bfl <dig>  suggesting a role of the hydrolase in translation.

bfl <dig> protein is predicted to be associated with putative cytoplasmic protein  bfl <dig> 

besides the previously identified polyketide cyclase bfl <dig> we identify now bfl <dig> as an oligoketide cyclase. its trans-acetylation activity is predicted to be associated with several blochmannia genes for the ubiquinone pathway  as well as the succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b- <dig> subunit bfl <dig>  this may suggest that bfl <dig> trans-acetylates succinyl-coa or some of the lipids involved in ubiquinone synthesis. we suggest further that the protein may be involved in the exchange and trans-membrane-transport of metabolites to or from the host.

discussion
reannotation of prokaryotic genomes
our study combines a number of bioinformatics tools for function predictions of previously not assigned proteins in an endosymbiont genome where currently direct data on proteins are difficult to obtain. we have to stress that besides sequence analysis with latest sensitive alignment algorithms we combine here the latest versions of several protein family databases, protein motifs, intrinsic features from the amino acid sequence as well as pathway and genome context methods. all these methods compare the unknown reading frame to related sequences, genes or motifs in proteins where direct experimental information is available. for blochmannia these involve primarily various gram negative species. thus a direct link  or indirect link  to e.coli proteins with experimentally verified protein function allows reliable protein function predictions in blochmannia.

efficiency considerations
the growth in databases has resulted in a wealth of information on validated proteins and protein functions. this improves function prediction for previously not annotated  reading frames in proteobacteria. in an earlier study on the intracellular bacterium mycoplasma pneumoniae  <cit> , we estimated that five years after the original publication of the genome we could find a more accurate prediction for about a third of the reading frames. we still consider this value to be a good estimate of the benefits by database growth and algorithm development and demonstrate this here for the blochmannia proteins classified as "unknown function" or "putative" in the original blochmannia genome publication in  <dig>  <cit> . for 72% of previously putative proteins a more solid function prediction could be given. this level of function reassignment would be similar for other genomes. endosymbionts have the particular challenge that direct experimental data on expressed proteins are difficult to obtain. conservation of a large part of their reading frames in other proteobacteria is partially helpful. on the other hand, it is well known that the conserved reading frames in e.coli with unclear function remain a challenge which can only be coped with by combining the most advanced techniques of sequence analysis and the additional knowledge from larger and larger data bases. our new analysis profits from the larger database size two years later. however, this required reanalysis, all comparative sequence searches for the blochmannia floridanus proteins had to be done again. furthermore, it was important to collect and collate data from several databases as each stores other aspects of sequence function . we had to combine all of these different information sources to obtain the best information on the analyzed protein sequences.

analysis strategy
in general, we would recommend a re-consideration of the published genome sequence annotation after  <dig> to  <dig> years with a focus on the previously unknown proteins. further reannotation steps may then follow after longer time spans. a methodological routine to re-analyze a genome sequence of interest starts with sequence comparison and analysis first, querying and collating all major sequence databases. after this there is a detailed search for molecular function. this involves protein motif searches and a study of the intrinsic features of the sequences. for the proteins which remain badly characterized in their function, genome and pathway context methods are important to establish more reliable suggestions for their function.

blochmannia protein predictions
the study illustrates that additional function assignments for proteins with previously unknown or only putative function encoded in the blochmannia genome is possible combining the above techniques and ressources. in the light of the challenges to cultivate blochmannia or express blochmannia proteins in host cells such as e.coli, an analysis applying bioinformatics is an important first step to further investigate the genome and functional capabilities of this endosymbiont. furthermore, we established links to experimentally well characterized proteins in other genomes  using genome and metabolic context, the growth of databases, more powerful software and extensive sequence analysis. these analyses involved sequence similarities, however we included in addition also several other methods: confirmation of the specific protein motifs and signatures needed for the molecular function predicted ; functional predictions from a conserved genome context exploiting tools such as string  <cit> ; the metabolic pathway context and including confirmed other proteins from the pathway to further validate the prediction; homology to structures available from structural genomics projects.

implications for metabolism and regulation
blochmannia could be shown to be more complete in several pathways including ubiquinone synthesis, inositol and nitrogen metabolism. furthermore, functional clusters for important cellular functions such as initiation of septum formation, for cellular regulation and replication control could be further elucidated.

from the previously  <dig> putative proteins  <dig>  could now be given a clearer functional assignment. this study combines knowledge from a number of databases as well as direct sequence analysis and phylogenetic comparisons including prediction techniques for genome context  <cit>  and pathway context  <cit>  to establish a more complete repertoire of the exact molecular and cellular function of these blochmannia proteins .

the same is true for the proteins previously classified as conserved hypothetical. the exponential growth of data, notably in bacterial genomes, and further analysis allowed specific functional prediction in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases. the present paper concisely summarizes all these predictions including pathways and functional associations of protein clusters as a basis for further research and experimental tests.

remaining unclear reading frames
genes encoding proteins with unknown function conserved in several species  are currently a topic of interest, in particular regarding conserved functions contained in many bacteria, including the small endosymbiont or parasite genomes. unfortunately, six of the conserved hypothetical proteins and, after re-examination one of the previous proteins with putative function assignment, remain unclear in their function. however, many of the blochmannia proteins are conserved within proteobacteria . this includes all just mentioned functionally unclear proteins. among these, bfl <dig> is so wide-spread that it occurs also in non-proteobacteria. the good conservation in several different genomes is an indicator that they present important and frequently used cellular functionalities. the putative molecular function assignments given for eleven previously conserved hypothetical proteins are confirmed by data from several databases . the specific molecular and cellular functions suggested for ten further proteins previously considered conserved hypothetical proteins were only made after extensive sequence analysis including comparative genomics.

CONCLUSIONS
the data provided here by detailed sequence analysis, links to experimental data on related protein sequences as well as genome and pathway context extend the described repertoire of blochmannia capabilities. this includes molecular functions for many previously conserved hypothetical or putative proteins, the nitrogen and inositol metabolism, periplasmic proteins, cell division and dna, rna as well as ubiquinone synthesis including some structure predictions . the predicted additional functions for the studied blochmannia proteins can now be further tested and analyzed. furthermore, this study adds to the comparative characterization of the proteins considered to be the inventory of a "minimal cell"  <cit>  looking at a compact endosymbiont genome.
