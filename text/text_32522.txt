BACKGROUND
the exponentially increasing amount of sequence information has spurred the need for automated and accurate large-scale prediction and functional annotation of genes. a new generation of technologies is speeding up the sequencing even more, but this comes at the price of some biases and an increased error rate  <cit> . thus, it is important to investigate unexplained phenomena for systematic errors. one such phenomenon is a large number of annotated genes with long overlaps. overlapping genes are frequently observed in microbial chromosomes. although they were initially found in the genomes of bacteriophages, animal viruses and mitochondria  <cit> , they currently represent an important part of the genes in the fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . furthermore, it is already known that overlapping pairs are conserved across species  <cit> , and it is likely they have more homologs than genes that do not overlap. this makes the overlapping gene pairs highly valuable as a tool for function prediction as other structural prokaryotic features such as well-conserved operons, conserved distances between adjacent genes, cog groups or kegg pathways have been used to infer functions in genomic and metagenomic data  <cit> . however, they still remain strongly affected by sequencing and annotating errors  <cit> . among the fully sequenced microbial genomes, thousands of overlapping gene pairs have been predicted in all three transcriptional directional classes , convergent  and divergent   <cit> . the overlaps can arise when the 3'-end of one of the genes in a pair is extended because a stop codon has been deleted, or because the stop codon has been disrupted by a point mutation or a frameshift mutation  <cit> . however, the overlaps can also arise through the elongation of the 5'-end of a gene because an alternative upstream start codon has been used  <cit> . while there is plenty of evidence that small gene overlaps of several nucleotides enhance coordinated transcription of functionally related genes  <cit> , it is not known whether long overlaps are the product of special functional constraints or simply of large-scale misannotations. for bacterial genomes it has been reported that overlaps longer than  <dig> bps have a reduced shine-dalgarno  prediction percentage  <cit> . this regulatory motif appears to work in concert with the start codons as part of an elaborate regulatory system for gene expression. therefore, one possible explanation for this low percentage is that many of these genes are incorrectly annotated.

a number of previous studies of overlapping microbial genes suggested that annotation errors such as misprediction of start codons, loss of termination codons as well as the misidentification of the entire open reading frames  can influence the statistics of overlapping genes and hence their analysis  <cit>  . these studies used to exclude from their analysis both the genes coding for hypothetical proteins and the genes whose start codons have been assigned differently by the annotation programs and have therefore been deposited with different coordinates in the databases. on the other hand, the authors tend to accept the gene pairs that are conserved in the cog database  <cit> . only rogozin et al.  <cit>  have tried to find out how the overlapping genes evolve and have examined some long convergent overlaps. nevertheless none of the previous studies has attempted to quantify and characterize rigorously these possible misannotations to be able to study gene overlaps more reliably. here we analyse long overlaps between well-characterized genes to discriminate true events from misannotations and to use this knowledge to develop rules for improving gene annotation.

RESULTS
usually, adjacent genes in prokaryotic chromosomes tend to be separated by a short intergenic distance or overlap by some base pairs in a preferred phase  <cit> . particularly common are overlaps where the stop codon of the upstream gene is overlapping with the start codon of the downstream gene   <cit> . overlapping genes among prokaryotes represented around 17%  out of the total gene pairs contained in  <dig> microbial genomes . although it is lower percentage than some authors have reported before  <cit> , those overlapping genes are a consistent feature of the prokaryotic chromosomes and are worthy of study. of these  <dig>  overlaps we selected  <dig>  where both genes were well-characterized for our study. among the prokaryotic overlaps, those with co-directional overlaps were clearly the most frequent, reflecting the fact that this is the most common orientation of two adjacent prokaryotic genes  <cit> . furthermore, the genes in the prokaryotic chromosomes tend to be grouped into operons of functionally related genes and usually, those genes of a given operon are on the same strand  <cit> . in fact, co-directional overlaps represented around 92%  of the well-characterized overlaps considered here, while convergent overlaps represented 7%  and divergent overlaps 1% . of these overlaps, we chose a set of  <dig> overlaps longer than  <dig> bps that had consistent coordinates in three different databases.

types of misannotation
we were looking for functional overlaps among the  <dig> overlaps longer than  <dig> bps. every gene of the overlapping pairs was compared with its orthologs. if there is a difference in gene length between the gene and its orthologs the overlap is probably unreal and caused by a sequencing or annotation error in one of the genes of the overlap. this difference in gene length could also mean that the overlap is real though unconserved and therefore, not functional. although we can not definitively distinguish between these two facts, by categorizing the long overlaps manually, we can notice patterns that provide us with hints. for a list of all the overlaps manually analysed here see additional file  <dig> 

first of all, we manually analyzed  <dig> co-directional overlaps longer than  <dig> bps. surprisingly all of them fell into the following categories :

i) 5'-end extension of the downstream gene due to either a mispredicted start codon or a frameshift at 5'-end of the gene. the upstream gene had the same length as its orthologs, while the downstream gene was longer than its orthologs at the 5'-end. furthermore, in all the  <dig> cases classified, the downstream gene had alternative start codons which were downstream of the predicted initial codon, which could produce a product with a similar or even an equal length to its orthologs. these cases represented around 57% of the co-directional overlaps longer than  <dig> bps analysed. therefore this suggests that the most important cause of long overlaps is a misprediction of the start codon of a gene;

ii) fragmentation of a gene caused by a frameshift. in these cases the upstream gene was longer than its orthologs at the 3'-end and the downstream gene was clearly shorter than its orthologs. furthermore, in these  <dig> cases both members of the overlapping pair could be mapped to a single gene in a closely related species, suggesting that a frameshift mutation/sequencing error fragmented one gene into an overlapping pair. these cases represented around 23% of the co-directional overlaps longer than  <dig> bps analysed and therefore, this is the second most important group of misannotations.

iii) 3'-end extension of the upstream gene due to either a frameshift at 3'-end of gene or point mutation at the stop codon. the upstream gene was longer than its orthologs at the 3'-end, whereas the downstream gene had a similar length to its orthologs. either a frameshift at the 3'-end or a point mutation at the stop codon may cause the loss of the stop codon, thus extending the reading frame to the next in-frame stop codon. we found  <dig> cases  that showed this pattern.

iv) redundant gene prediction where the genes overlap entirely or almost entirely and are in the same reading frame. this is a really strange case and actually we only found  <dig> gene pairs , most of them labelled as putative genes.

v) 5' & 3'-end extension which is a combination of i) and iii). the upstream gene is longer than its orthologs at the 3'-end as well as the downstream gene being longer than its orthologs at the 5'-end. we classified in this group  <dig> overlaps .

regarding the overlapping lengths, the overlapping mean length of the 5', 3' and 5' & 3'-end extension groups was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bps respectively. nevertheless, the overlapping mean length of the fragmentation type was  <dig> bps, therefore this type of misannotations appears to cause longer overlaps. in order to know what type of misannotations causes the longest overlaps, we did not take into account the lengths of the overlaps caused by redundant gene prediction, because the gene pair is overlapping entirely or almost entirely and actually this type of misannotations occurs very rarely.

although we extensively focused on the co-directional orientation, we also examined the long overlaps in the other orientations, specifically,  <dig> divergent overlaps and  <dig> convergent overlaps longer than  <dig> bps. all the divergent long overlaps belonged to group i), which means that all of them were misannotations due to a 5'-end extension of one or both genes of the divergent overlap. however, among the convergent overlaps we found putative true overlaps. actually, as other authors have reported before  <cit> , conserved convergent overlaps are affected by annotation errors to a lesser extent because they are not affected by the high rate of misannotated start codons. however, we could classify  <dig> convergent overlaps into group iii) as misannotations. therefore, the misannotations are also affecting convergent overlaps, particularly those misannotations caused by a 3'-end extension in one or both genes of the pair. the other  <dig> convergent overlaps might be real, although most of them are only conserved in very close species.

thus, we can now suggest ways to correct  <dig> gene pairs and clear the respective overlaps that are the result of misannotations. these overlaps caused by misannotations represent around the 2% of the overlaps of well characterized genes . therefore, this is worth taking into account in the annotation processes.

misannotations in prokaryotic genomes
as expected, the number of overlaps decreases with an increasing overlap length . equally expected is the avoidance of multiples of  <dig> bps overlaps for adjacent co-directional genes  <cit> . although figure  <dig> shows multiples of  <dig> bps convergent and divergent overlaps, none co-directional overlap was found with an overlapping length of multiple of  <dig> bps. we also studied in co-directional overlaps whether some particular genomes stood out in terms of overlaps because of their annotation protocols. indeed, in some genomes large overlaps are more abundant with brucella melitensis  <dig> m leading with  <dig> likely misannotated events. interestingly,  <dig> of those pairs were due to fragmentations . second in the list is rhodopirellula baltica sh <dig>  which has a really strange genome. it contains  <dig> misannotated overlaps,  <dig> of them are due to 5' or 5' & 3'-end extensions and it is the genome which has more divergent overlaps misannotated. also we have observed that xanthomonas genomes accumulated a high number of misannotations. probably, the initial mispredictions in the first xanthomonas genomes sequenced were propagated within this taxon due to the high sequence similarity among their genomes. for a list of  <dig> genomes with high number of overlaps see additional file  <dig> 

we tried to further identify reasons that might cause frameshifts and misannotations in the genome projects . the genomes that accumulate a high number of errors are not the longest in size or the highest in gene content. for instance, the brucella melitensis  <dig> m chromosome has  <dig> nucleotides and  <dig> predicted genes and accumulated  <dig> misannotations, whereas the vibrio vulnificus yj <dig> chromosome has  <dig> nucleotides and  <dig> predicted genes but accumulated only  <dig> annotation errors. a high at content could be related to a high number of mispredictions of start codons. however, no correlation between a high number of misannotations and a high percentage of at was observed. we also did not observe any clear bias to any sequencing or annotation method, though  <dig> out of the  <dig> genomes worst annotated were done by glimmer predictor  <cit>  exclusively. however, the use of a determined gene predictor or a combination of different gene predictors, does not assure us that we will avoid the types of misannotations described here. the number of misannotations could also be related to the sequencing date. on one hand, an early sequencing date could be related to a high number of misannotations because less maturated technologies and tools were used. on the other hand, a recent sequencing date could be related to a high number of misannotations due to lower coverage and a higher degree of automation. however, no trend was observed in the number of misannotations regarding the sequencing date.

mispredicted start codons
5'-end extensions clearly have the highest number of misannotations because of mispredictions of start codons or upstream frameshifts whereby the former is clearly dominant . therefore we can say that the main problem in the annotation of real genes is the misprediction of start codons. most genes tend to start with aug while the alternatives gug and uug are used sparingly  <cit> . aug is a more potent initiator than gug or uug  <cit> , which are considered weak start codons. to quantify the observed effect regarding start codon usage, we compared the start codons of potentially misannotated genes with those from randomly chosen microbial genes. the genes which have putative mispredicted start codons , v) and from misannotated divergent overlaps group) had alternative start codons  downstream in the sequence. this could indicate that a gene with a mispredicted start codon has an additional correct one nearby. furthermore, we observed statistical differences  which were extremely significant among the start codon usage between genes with a putative mispredicted start codon and a random set of genes. it seems that the use of the weak start codons  is overrepresented among the genes with putative mispredicted start codons . we found that from the  <dig> genes, which potentially could have a mispredicted start codon,  <dig> start with aug, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> with gug and uug respectively. in contrast, among the random sets of genes around ~ <dig> start with aug, whereas only around ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> with gug and uug respectively. therefore, long overlaps, in conjunction with the use of weak start codons could be a sign that the 5'-end of an orf has been mispredicted and must be taken into account by the annotation algorithms. in fact, some previous sd studies agreed with this finding. starmer et al. explained genome annotation errors with a bias in the start codon prediction towards the usage of gug instead of aug  <cit> , whereas a previous study performed by ma et al.  <cit>  found in e. coli k <dig> a significant group of genes which started with gug or uug and which do not have an sd sequence and hence were erroneously annotated as putative or hypothetical proteins.

the longest real co-directional overlap
when studying co-directional overlaps below  <dig> bps, the longest real one we could identify was caused by two co-directional genes coding for the dna polymerase psi subunit  and an alanine acetyltransferase . figure  <dig> shows the alignment of the c-terminal end of the dna polymerase psi subunit and the n-terminal end of the alanine acetyltransferase as well as an arrangement of overlapping regions and amino acid conservation within the overlap among three representative enterobacteria species. this figure highlights the high similarity among the enterobacteria orthologs at the c-terminal end of the protein encoded in hold gene, at the n-terminal end of the protein encoded in rimi gene and within the overlapping region at the level of nucleotide sequence. this overlap was previously reported to be  <dig> bps long in escherichia coli  <cit>  which would correspond to around  <dig> overlapping amino acids; however orthologs gene pairs in the yersinia and salmonella genomes reached  <dig> bps, which would correspond to overlaps of about  <dig> amino acids. although the exact gene length seems genus specific, this particular overlap is well conserved among enterobacteria, and therefore unlikely to be due to a misannotation reported here.

CONCLUSIONS
misannotation of real genes leading to artificial extensions of genes seems to be more frequent than previously anticipated and can lead to frequent gene overlaps. we could show here that all co-directional and divergent overlaps extending  <dig> bps are artificial due to misannotations that can be classified into five categories. this clear-cut result enables us to propose a simple rule that can flag many thousand erroneous gene length predictions to facilitate automatic annotation. on the other hand, convergent orientation seems to allow longer overlaps than the other two orientations, although convergent long overlaps are also affected by misannotations.

the most common misannotation is the 5'-end extension, mostly caused by the misprediction of start codons. the respective genes carrying putative mispredictions of the start codon show an overrepresentation of weak start codons use. thus genes with a 5'-end extension involved in long overlaps with predicted weak start codons must be checked by the annotation algorithms.

although several species seemed to have a higher number of such potential misannotations, no correlation was found with genome size, gene content, gc content, sequencing or orf prediction method, annotation team or sequencing date. therefore these imprecise gene predictions have the potential to affect any microbial genome annotation process.
