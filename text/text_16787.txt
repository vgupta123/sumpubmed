BACKGROUND
a predominant portion of the eukaryotic genome harbors different repetitive sequences while a small portion  is transcribed and processed into mature transcripts  <cit> . repetitive sequences are dynamic genome components encompassing transposable elements, major satellites and simple sequence repeats   <cit> . the highly polymorphic and multiallelic ssrs  <cit>  are potentially involved in genome evolution by creating and maintaining genetic variability  <cit> . most of these ssrs are found in non-coding regions of the genomes while a small fraction is retained in the transcriptome  <cit>  participating in gene regulation through transcription, translation or gene silencing  <cit> . the expansion and contraction of ssrs within the protein-coding sequences are recognized to modulate disease risks such as huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy and fragile x syndrome  <cit> . however, the distribution of ssrs within non-coding and coding regions of the genomes, even in the best characterized ones such that of human, remains unclear. to explore the organization and expression of such repeat-tagged genes, we targeted the transcriptome of water buffalo bubalus bubalis as a model system, an important player in the agriculture, dairy and meat industries in the indian sub-continent. novelty also lie in the fact that buffalo genome is unexplored in terms of genes present and its association with the ssrs.

simple repeats, gata and gaca, were identified from the satellite dna of banded krait in snakes and thus named as banded krait minor . upon subsequent characterization, this was found to be conserved across the species including humans showing specific organization to the heterogametic  sex chromosomes  <cit> . high condensation of these repeats in somatic cells and decondensation in germ cells during early stages of development, sex-/tissue-specific expression in higher eukaryotes were all thought to be involved in sex differentiation  <cit> . however, the organization of gaca/gata repeats within the mrna transcripts from both somatic tissues and spermatozoa remains largely unabsolved.

ejaculated spermatozoa are terminally differentiated cells in which transcription and/or translation of nuclear encoded mrnas are unlikely. therefore, until recently, the male genome was the only cargo the spermatozoa were thought to carry. the discovery of many soluble signaling molecules, transcription factors and structures such as centriole being introduced by spermatozoan into the zygotic cytoplasm upon fertilization has changed this perception  <cit> . despite transcriptionally dormant state, the spermatozoa retain an entourage of transcripts, encoding transcription factors and proteins involved in signal transduction, cell proliferation, dna condensation, regulation of sperm motility, capacitation and acrosome reaction  <cit> .

owing to the tissue- and sex-specific organization of the gaca/gata repeats and participation of the spermatozoal rna during and post-syngamy, we studied the gaca/gata tagged transcriptomes from the somatic/gonadal tissues and spermatozoa of buffalo bubalus bubalis. the mrna transcripts so uncovered were further characterized for their sequence organization, homology status, expressional variation, copy number and evolutionary status. moreover, chromosomal mapping was done for the candidate genes tagged with gaca/gata repeats. in addition, distribution of the gaca/gata repeats within the genomes across the species was also studied.

RESULTS
genomic/transcriptomic distribution of gaca/gata across the species
the in-silico analyses of the available complete or incomplete genomes of archeas, eubacteria and  <dig> eukaryotes including human revealed total absence of the gaca/gata repeats in the prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes such as saccharomyces cerevisae and dictyostelium discoideum . however, a gradual accumulation of these repeats was observed in the higher eukaryotes . detailed analysis of  <dig> species showed differential occurrence of the tetramers of gaca/gata repeats among different chromosomes and species . of these, the human, dog and arabidopsis genomes were found to be gata rich whereas chicken genome showed similar occurrence of the gaca/gata tetramers. the cattle remained indecipherable due to its unfinished genome. the c. elegans genome was found to harbor only  <dig> regions containing tetramer of gaca and  <dig>  gata repeats. when considered individually, the highest occurrence of gaca was detected in chicken and that of gata in dog. however, both gaca and gata tetramers were concentrated on the y chromosome in the humans. in case of dogs, the  <dig> was predominant on the chromosomes  <dig> and x and  <dig> on the chromosome  <dig>  distribution of these repeats on the y chromosome of dogs could not be studied since their sequences have not been fully explored. the gallus gallus showed maximum occurrence of gaca tetramer on the chromosome  <dig> and that of gata on the chromosome y .

moreover, the analyses of the transcriptomes of the above mentioned species  revealed the association of these bkm derived repeats with several mrna transcripts across the species. comparative analysis showed that more number of transcripts was tagged with gaca repeat  compared to that with gata . however, the gaca repeat was abundant in the mouse transcriptome, while gata, in the human. thus, a differential distribution of gaca/gata repeats was observed in both the non-coding and coding regions of the genomes within and across the species.

identification and characterization of gaca/gata tagged transcripts
after divulgence of gaca/gata repeats in the mammalian transcriptomes, we pursued with the isolation, cloning and characterization of the transcripts tagged with these repeats in water buffalo bubalus bubalis using varying length of oligos  to conduct microsatellite associated sequence amplification  with cdna from somatic tissues, gonads and spermatozoa. briefly, a total of  <dig> amplicons encompassing  <dig> from somatic tissues/gonads and  <dig> from spermatozoa, each from  <dig> animals were uncovered with gaca repeat  and  <dig> amplicons encompassing  <dig> from different tissues and  <dig> from spermatozoa were uncovered with gata repeat .

# the transcripts uncovered from somatic and gonadal tissues are given in  whereas spermatozoal transcripts in . all of the gaca-tagged transcripts were submitted to the genbank and the accession numbers were obtained for each transcript. the analysis carried out for their homologues, size and chromosomal positions is also given. blast search showed homology of these transcripts with several genes/gene fragments across the species. notably, only few of them represented by '*' had homology along the length while others showed partial homology.

# the mrna transcripts detected in somatic tissues are described in  whereas spermatozoal transcripts in . note that these transcripts did not show any homology with genes present in databank.

cloning and sequencing of the gaca uncovered amplicons identified a total of  <dig> different transcripts in the somatic tissues and gonads whereas  <dig> types of transcripts were detected in the spermatozoa of buffaloes . upon subsequent sequence analyses and characterization, we observed that of the  <dig> tissue-originated transcripts, only  <dig> were common to all the tissues studied while remaining ones showed tissue-specificity . of these tissue-specific transcripts,  <dig> were exclusive to the testis,  <dig> each for kidney and heart,  <dig> common for testis and ovary while  <dig> were absent in the lung. of the  <dig> spermatozoal transcripts uncovered, only  <dig> were shared with somatic tissues whereas remaining  <dig> were exclusive to the spermatozoal rna pool . database search revealed that ~80% of the somatic and ~60% of spermatozoal transcripts have significant homologies  with various coding genes across the species. however, only two of them showed similarity along their entire length , whereas remaining ones were homologous either to the 5'/3' regions or intervening sequences of the characterized genes. remaining fragments were found to be novel as they showed non-substantial or no homology with the genes present in the databank. interestingly, >80% of the homologous genes were found to be involved either in signal transduction or cell-cell interaction pathways whereas remaining ~20% were implicated with several diseases reported in the human. details of the uncovered gaca-tagged transcripts, their homologous genes and corresponding accession numbers are given in the table  <dig> 

in contrast to gaca, gata repeat uncovered fewer transcripts but showed well-defined tissue-specific profiles . briefly, a total of  <dig> types of mrna transcripts were isolated and characterized from the somatic and gonadal tissues barring lung and heart which were conspicuously devoid of any amplicon . these transcripts further exhibited tissue-specificities such that  <dig> were exclusive to the testis, while remaining  <dig> common to all the tissues. also, we identified  <dig> types of transcripts from the spermatozoa  which upon characterization were found to be identical to that uncovered from the testis . however, other tissues shared only  <dig> out of  <dig> spermatozoal transcripts. further, >90% of these somatic and spermatozoal transcripts showed no homology with any of the genes. the remaining ones were similar to bovid specific bac clones, but none of the gata-tagged transcripts established homology along its entire length. details of the gata tagged somatic and spermatozoal transcripts including their accession numbers, origin and size are given in the table  <dig>  the observed tissue-specific nature of these gaca/gata tagged transcripts was confirmed by rna slot-blot hybridizations  and rt-pcr analyses .

sequence polymorphisms detected in gaca/gata tagged transcripts
following homology search, we analyzed the sequence organization of these mrna transcripts at inter-tissue or tissue-spermatozoal levels. the possibility of interclonal sequence variations was ruled out by analyzing  <dig> recombinant clones each of the gaca/gata uncovered amplicons.

our study demonstrated several single nucleotide variations and indels in most of the gaca-tagged transcripts. as mentioned above, only  <dig> transcripts were common amongst tissues and spermatozoa, and the remaining ones restricted to a single tissue or sperm. of the transcripts detected exclusively in the somatic tissues, a  <dig>  kb one  showed insertions of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides exclusively in the lung, several point nucleotide changes specific to lung/heart or testis/ovary besides a few randomly distributed ones across the tissues . the transcripts shared by spermatozoa and tissues also brought out some interesting features. for instance, a  <dig>  kb transcript  showing homology with nfatc <dig> gene demonstrated the insertion of  <dig> bp and several single-nucleotide variations exclusively in the spermatozoa . next, the point nucleotide changes detected in the transcript similar to hbgf- <dig> gene  were either common to the tissues, or to spermatozoa . similar random deletions, insertions, transversion and transition at various points of  <dig> bp transcript of wasf <dig> gene, were detected only in the testis . interestingly, ankyrin repeat domain of  <dig> bp  showed identical nucleotide sequences both in the testis and sperm, but polymorphism at several points in the ovary. this transcript was not detected in any of the somatic tissues . remaining transcripts such as β-transducin repeat and novel 450/ <dig> bp ones showed similar sequences amongst the tissues except few point nucleotide changes .

next, we analyzed the gata-tagged transcripts to explore possible sequence alterations. though, only  <dig> gata-tagged transcripts were uncovered,  <dig> common across the tissues and  <dig> restricted to testis/spermatozoa. sequencing of  <dig> recombinants of each of the  <dig> transcripts demonstrated their identical sequences in both the testis and spermatozoa. however, remaining  <dig> transcripts evinced several single nucleotide deletions, insertions and/or substitutions at many places. among them was a novel  <dig> bp transcript  harboring an insertion of  <dig> bp at one place exclusively in the spleen, and several point nucleotide changes in sperm/kidney . yet another  <dig> bp transcript  demonstrated variations such that the point nucleotide changes were either shared between the spermatozoa/gonads or spermatozoa/somatic tissues . remaining novel  <dig> and  <dig> bp transcripts  showed conserved sequences across the tissues and spermatozoa .

copy number status of the uncovered genes
following the sequence analyses, the copy number of gaca/gata-tagged gene/gene fragments was calculated by extrapolation of the straight curves obtained in the real time pcr assays using  <dig> fold dilution series of the respective recombinant plasmids. extrapolation of these standard curves demonstrated the copy number status of the identified gene/gene fragments  which varied from  <dig> to  <dig> per haploid genome in buffalo.

out of  <dig> gaca-tagged transcripts studied, nineteen had single copy; eleven, 2–3; one each, 8– <dig> and 25– <dig> copies, respectively . similarly, of the  <dig> gata-tagged transcripts, three were single copy and five had 2– <dig> copies each. briefly, the copy number varied from  <dig> for 50%, 2– <dig> for 45% and 8– <dig> for remaining 5% for all the gaca/gata tagged genes/gene fragments.

# the expression for gene fragments tagged with gaca repeat is described in  whereas for gata-tagged ones in . note the highest expression of most of the gaca-tagged and all gata-tagged genes in testis and/or spermatozoa.

differential expression of the gaca/gata tagged transcripts
after ascertaining the tissue-specific organizational variations in the gaca/gata tagged transcripts, their comparative expression profiles were studied to determine possible functional status in the somatic tissues, gonads and spermatozoa. the quantitative expressional analysis was performed for individual mrna transcript with β-actin as an internal control using sybr green assay in real time pcr. the results so obtained were substantiated further by expression data from the five additional animals.

a total of  <dig> gaca-tagged transcripts were studied  showing differential expression amongst tissues and spermatozoa. the comparative expression of the transcripts detected in the somatic tissues and gonads, evidenced highest expression of ~50% transcripts in the testis and spermatozoa, ~20% in spleen/liver, and remaining ones with uniform expression in all the tissues. further, the relative expressional studies for the spermatozoal transcripts demonstrated highest expression of ~65% transcripts in testis and/or spermatozoa, 15% in liver/spleen/heart and 20% carrying uniform expression in all the tissues . in conclusion,  <dig> gaca-tagged transcripts demonstrated high or exclusive expression in the testis and/or spermatozoa, encompassing  <dig> in the spermatozoa followed by testis,  <dig> in spermatozoa, and  <dig> specific to the testis. similarly,  <dig> transcripts demonstrated highest expression in liver/spleen and  <dig> showed consistent expression in all of the sources studied. among all the uncovered transcripts, the highest expression observed was of ankyrin repeat domain , followed by of wasf <dig> gene  . the testis specific expression was observed only for  <dig> transcripts namely ubap <dig> and β-transducin repeat . others showed either highest/exclusive expression in the spermatozoa  or uniform expression in all the tissues .

following, we pursued the expressional analyses of the gata-tagged transcripts which demonstrated their highest expression either in testis or spermatozoa or both, compared to that in other tissues . lung and heart showed almost negligible expression which substantiated the absence of gata-tagged transcripts in these tissues. thus, most of the gaca-tagged and all the gata-tagged transcripts were found to be specific either to the testis or spermatozoa. details of the expressional analysis of all gaca/gata tagged transcripts including their accession numbers and relative expression  have been given in the table  <dig> 

evolutionary status of the entrapped genes
to determine the evolutionary significance of the gaca/gata tagged transcripts, we studied their conservation across the species by cross-hybridization with genomic dna from  <dig> different species . among the gaca-tagged transcripts, ~75% were found to be conserved across the  <dig> species whereas the remaining ones were exclusively detected in the buffaloes or other bovids. contrary to this, all the gata-tagged transcripts showed their cross-hybridization across the species showing differential signal intensities  suggesting their wider distribution than that of the gaca-tagged ones.

chromosomal mapping
chromosomal mapping employing fluorescence in situ hybridization  was conducted for two gaca tagged mrna transcripts, ankyrin repeat domain- <dig> and ubiquitin associated protein  <dig> . the ubap <dig> was mapped onto the short arm of metacentric chromosome  <dig>  whereas ankyrin repeat domain- <dig> onto the proximal end of the short arm of sub-metacentric chromosome  <dig> .

discussion
simple sequence repeats  though present ubiquitously, are abundant in the non-coding regions  <cit>  which possibly counteract or minimize the ill effects of their frequent shrinkage and expansion causing genetic instability in the coding regions. presence of such repeats within the transcripts suggests their possible involvement in gene regulation  <cit> . in present study, we established the association of gaca and gata repeats with the buffalo transcriptome and detected sequence polymorphisms and differential gene expression in several uncovered genes. moreover, highest expression of gaca/gata tagged transcripts in testis and/or spermatozoa indicates their crucial roles in male gametogenesis.

extensive in silico analyses demonstrating absence of gaca/gata repeats in prokaryotes, and presence of a few or no repeats in s. cerevisiae, c. elegans, arabidopsis thaliana and drosophila melanogaster suggests the accumulation of these repeats in higher eukaryotes during the course of evolution. further, exploration of gaca/gata tagged transcriptomes from the lower to higher eukaryotes showing absence of gaca in arabidopsis thaliana, dictyostelium discoideum, drosophila melanogaster and c. elegans, and gata in sus scrofa, c. elegans and d. discoideum, and their presence in the respective non-coding regions established their species-specific distribution. these repeats seem to have been acquired in the transcriptomes alongwith the increased genetic complexities in higher eukaryotes. further, the highlighted sex-chromosomal occurrence and diversity of tagged transcripts suggested the involution of gaca/gata repeats in regulation of sex-differentiation.

tandem repeats residing within the coding regions mostly involved in transcription/translation, can also mediate phase variation, and alter the functions and antigenecity of the proteins encoded  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> different mrna transcripts ,  <dig> known and  <dig> novel ones, were identified using ssrs of gaca/gata, which can be used as a milestone for contemplating other repeats to establish their combined conclusive significance within and adjacent to the coding regions. however, gaca/gata tagged transcripts are particularly more important since these are detected in the buffalo spermatozoa as well. many signaling molecules and transcription factors have been reported in the spermatozoa which pass into the zygotic cytoplasm on fertilization yet ~3000– <dig> transcripts remains to be characterized  <cit> . the existence of gaca/gata tagged transcripts in buffalo spermatozoa is the first finding which brightens the involvements of these repeats and tagged transcripts during pre- and post-fertilization events. it also opens up newer vistas offering an opportunity to undertake functional characterization of individual mrna transcripts during fertilization and embryonic development.

interestingly, the buffalo transcriptome was found to be enriched with gaca repeat while other species including human were observed to be gata rich. the primates and cetartiodactyls' genomes are relatively gc poor  <cit> , the gc richness of buffalo genome and transcriptome seem to be unique for its organization and thus for replication timings, genetic recombination, methylation and gene expression  <cit> . the differential transcript profile uncovered may be explained either towards their diverse functions in somatic tissues, gonads , and spermatozoa, or specific functions at various stages of development. absence of gata-tagged transcripts in lung/heart is anticipated to be their transcriptional quiescence whereas tissue-specific transcripts entailed their exclusive requirement in the respective tissues. moreover, there are two possible explanations for the detection of  <dig> of  <dig> gaca-tagged and  <dig> of  <dig> gata-tagged transcripts in testis or spermatozoa. first, the transcripts could not be picked up in other tissues due to either polymorphic nature of ssrs or much lower number of transcripts, and second, they are transcriptionally dormant in other tissues barring testis/spermatozoa.

dna sequence variation can contribute to phenotypic variation by affecting the steady-level of mrna molecules of a particular gene in a given cell or tissue  <cit> . the tissue- and spermatozoa-specific sequence organizations in transcripts tagged with gaca/gata repeats substantiated this hypothesis. some transcripts showed nucleotide changes exclusively in the spermatozoa, few in the testis, whereas other variations were shared only between testis and spermatozoa. these findings may be explicated by silenced state of the representative transcripts in somatic tissues which are active in testis/spermatozoa or vice versa.

sequence polymorphisms have been shown to regulate the differences in gene expressions, and inter- and intraspecific phenotypic variations in various organisms  <cit> . the observed sequence polymorphism and expressional variation for the uncovered genes can be explained by this hypothesis. the uniform expression of ~30% gaca-tagged transcripts suggested their consistent necessitate in all the tissues and sperm, whereas ~10% with highest expression in liver or spleen indicated their involvement in hepatocellular and immunological activities, respectively. similarly, the highest expression of most of the gaca- and gata-tagged transcripts was observed in testis and/or spermatozoa. thus, male-specific expression observed herein corroborated with the earlier studies suggesting the involvement of gaca/gata repeats in sex-differentiation and their predominant roles in spermatogenesis and fertilization.

CONCLUSIONS
present study suggests that gaca/gata repeats have been gradually accumulated in the transcriptomes of higher eukaryotes with an increase of their genetic complexities. this work also established the gaca richness of buffalo transcriptome and the existence of gaca/gata tagged transcripts in spermatozoa. most interestingly, the exclusive expression of the gaca/gata-tagged transcripts in the testis and/or spermatozoa substantiated their involvement in various testicular functions. this is a pioneer study exploring the gaca/gata repeats in buffalo transcriptomes which highlight the possible key functions of these repeats and tagged transcripts in pre- and post-fertilization events. following this approach, other repeats can be used to excavate further the tagged transcripts in different species for their comparative organization and expression, which would assist resolving the enigma of such simple sequence repeats in the mammalian genome.
