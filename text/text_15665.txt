BACKGROUND
gibberellins  is a family of diterpenoid plant hormones, first detected in 1930s from culture filtrates of gibberella fujikuroi, a known pathogen of rice plants  <cit> . in  <dig>  ga was isolated and identified as plant hormone from the extracts of higher plants  <cit> . ga appear to be involved in every aspect of plant growth and development, but their most typical  property is the enhancement of stem growth  <cit> . ga may modify the sex expression of flowers, induce the parthenocarpic development of fruit and delay senescence. they obviate the need for exposure to red light in the germination of seeds and spores, and the need for vernalisation in the growth of bulbs and tubers. they are associated with the breaking of winter dormancy and stimulate the formation of hydrolytic enzymes in germinating cereal grain  <cit> . currently  <dig> gas have been identified, while  <dig> fungi, pathogenic and non-pathogenic, associated with plants and/or soil has been reported as ga producers  <cit> .

endophytic fungi have been found to colonize the roots of plants  <cit>  and have usually been defined as those fungi growing asymptomatically within the tissues of their host plants, excluding pathogenic fungi and mycorrhizae  <cit> . this relationship is subjected to change and replacement by other endophytes depending on environmental conditions  <cit>  and host requirement. fungal endophytes of roots can therefore be defined as those fungi located within apparently healthy, functional root tissues at the moment of sample collection  <cit> . unlike mycorrhizal fungi, endophytes reside entirely within host tissues and may emerge during host senescence  <cit> . endophytes have been shown to confer fitness benefits to host plants including tolerance to herbivory, heat, salt, disease, and drought, and increased below- and above-ground biomass  <cit> . endophytic colonization may also improve the ecological adaptability of the host by enhancing tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . penicillium citrinum has been reported as common endophytic fungus of cereal plants like wheat and soybean. it had been isolated from different environmental conditions, ranging from permafrost sediments to agricultural fields and forest soils. it is most vigorously studied laboratory taxon that gained importance after discovery of well-known mycotoxin citrinin. currently it is being explored for different secondary metabolites it can produce and their associated benefits  <cit> .

sand dunes in coastal regions of south korea are being destroyed due to anthropogenic disturbances such as military action as well as beach construction and recreational activities. the intensity of artificial activities had affected the speed and efficiency of their conservation and revegetation  <cit> . we investigated root endophytic fungi of sand-dune flora for gas production as such work had not been carried out in the past. this paper report screening of ixeris repens, a common plant of sandy beaches across east asian countries  <cit>  for plant growth promoting metabolites by root endophytic fungi.

RESULTS
screening for plant growth promoting activity of fungal metabolites on waito-c rice
fifteen endophytic fungi were isolated from roots of ixeris repens, collected from sand dune at pohang beach, korean peninsula. the fungal culture filtrates were applied on waito-c rice seedlings and the length of seedlings was checked after one week of fungal culture filtrate application. out of  <dig> isolated fungi,  <dig> fungal isolates considerably promoted shoot lengths of rice seedlings. the fungal isolate ir-3- <dig> gave maximum plant and shoot length of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively, while culture filtrate of ir-10- <dig> gave plant height of  <dig>  cm and shoot length of  <dig>  cm. the plant and shoot growth promotion by g. fujikuroi was much lower than ir-3- <dig>  which was thus selected for further investigation .

bioassy of ir-3- <dig> for plant growth promoting activity on atriplex gemelinii
since the growth rate of sand dune plants are much slower, shoot lengths of atriplex gemelinii seedlings treated with ir-3- <dig> culture filtrate were measured after  <dig> days of culture filtrate application. the growth promoting capacity of ir-3- <dig> was compared with the results obtained from the application of culture filtrate of wild type g. fujikuroi and czapek broth, separately. since czapek medium contain nutrients, its control was used to observe possibility of nutrients effect on shoot elongation. shoot length of ir-3- <dig> culture filtrate treated seedlings was  <dig>  cm, which was higher than that of g. fujikuroi culture filtrate  and czapek broth  treated seedlings .

analyses of culture filtrate of ir-3- <dig> for the presence of gibberellins
gibberellins analysis showed the presence of ga <dig> , ga <dig>  ga <dig> , ga <dig> , ga <dig> , ga <dig> , ga <dig> , ga <dig>  <dig>  ng/ml), ga <dig> , ga <dig>  and ga <dig>  in culture filtrate of ir-3- <dig>  among them, ga <dig>  ga <dig>  ga <dig> and ga <dig> are physiologically active gas . fungal isolate ir-3- <dig> showed higher gas productivity than wild type g. fujikuroi . important finding was the detection of ga <dig> in the culture filtrates of fungal isolate ir-3- <dig> and wild type g. fujikuroi .

phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic analysis of fungal isolate ir-3- <dig> was carried out by distance tree construction. we aligned its <dig> sequences of available p. citrinum through blast sequence using clustalw and a neighbour joining tree was constructed from  <dig>  aligned sequences. a. fumigatus was used as an out group for tree rooting. the fungal isolate ir-3- <dig> gave 95% bootstrap support for a monoclade of p. citrinum strains , thus suggesting ir-3- <dig> as a new strain of p. citrinum .

on the basis of sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis, isolate ir-3- <dig> was thus identified as a new strain of p. citrinum. the its <dig> sequence of this strain has been submitted to genbank database . the fungal isolate was deposited to the korean agricultural culture collection  and was allotted no. kacc <dig>  the ir-3- <dig> was thus named as p. citrinum kacc <dig> 

discussion
endophytic fungi form mutualistic interactions with their host, the relationship therefore being beneficial for both partners  <cit> . mutualism frequently leads to enhanced growth of the host. in current study, the presence of plant growth promoting metabolites in culture filtrates of our fungal strains were determined through a primary screening experiment on waito-c rice seedlings. use of rice seedlings is beneficial as they easily grow under controlled and sterilized conditions, hydroponically, using autoclaved water-agar media. since this media is devoid of any nutrient, the sole effect of culture filtrate can easily be estimated. waito-c rice is a known dwarf rice cultivar with reduced ga biosynthesis. treatment of its seeds with uniconazol, a ga biosynthesis retardant, further suppresses the endogenous gas production by blocking its biosynthesis pathway in the plant. shoot elongation of these seedlings can be easily attributed to the activity of plant growth promoting secondary metabolites from fungal culture filtrates  <cit> . the microbial extracts had been and will continue to be a productive source of biologically active compounds  <cit> . screening of microbial secondary metabolites is an established method for the identification of novel and biologically active molecules  <cit> .

the plant growth promoting capacity of fungal secondary metabolites was confirmed by conducting a bioassay experiment on seedlings of atriplex gemelinii, a commonly occurring plant of sandy shores in china, japan and korea  <cit> . seeds of this plant did not exhibit dormancy, and germinate by soaking in water in a week time. being dune-plant, it showed adaptation to nutrient deficiency, growing in hydroponic media  without any supply of nutrient solution. although germination is rapid in these plants, but they possess slow growth rate , therefore the seedling length was much lower than those of rice. however, considerable increase in its shoot lengths was observed, when treated with ir-3- <dig> as compared to control. current findings confirmed the previous reports of shoot length promotion by fungal culture filtrate application  <cit> .

ga analysis of the culture filtrates of ir-3- <dig> and g. fujikuroi showed that bioactive ga production capacity of ir-3- <dig> was much higher than wild type g. fujikuroi, which narrates the significance of this newly isolated fungal strain. the discovery of ga <dig> in the culture filtrates of both ir-3- <dig> and g. fujikuroi will lead to the modification of fungal ga biosynthesis pathway by providing the missing links for ga biosynthesis in fungi. gibberellins were analyzed with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer , which is a useful tool because of its ability to analyze highly complex mixtures and to detect compounds of different classes simultaneously. gc-ms techniques have been used in clinical medicine and were only recently introduced in plant research  <cit> . recently, advances of mass spectrometry in food-related research  <cit>  and aroma analysis  <cit>  have been reported. phytohormones quantification by gc-ms-sim is well established and most reliable technique in ongoing investigations worldwide  <cit> . the major advantage of gc-ms is its unbiased character. in comparison with non-ms detection based chromatographic techniques , where only compounds targeted by a special analytical protocol are found, gc-ms analysis can result in interesting and unexpected new knowledge about a particular extract  <cit> . quantitative analysis is done by acquiring compound-specific molecular ions in selected ion monitoring  to increase the signal-to-noise ratio  of the ms experiment  <cit> .

approximately 70â€“ <dig>  species of fungi exists  <cit> . due to possible existence of different morpho/biotypes of fungi within single species, traditional morphological and biochemical methods are not considered reliable for identification  <cit> . on the other hand, dna sequence analysis methods are objective, reproducible and rapid means of identification, and thus gaining importance and have commonly been used to identify non sporulating endophytes  <cit> . we used  <dig> s gene and flanking its1/ <dig> regions for fungal identification. it is because highly conserved  <dig> s gene is suitable for higher taxanomic level analysis while highly variable its regions are useful for analysis at lower taxanomic levels  <cit> . constructing phylogenetic tree is crucial in molecular identification, since blast search alone cannot overcome possibilities of statistical errors. bootstrap consensus is applied to the constructed tree so as to read maximum sequence replications. neighbour joining tree with bootstrapping gave us a clear picture for identifying fungal isolate ir-3- <dig>  it is because more than  <dig> blast hits belonged to penicillium genera, thus strongly recommending our isolate as a member of this group. although many phylogenetic trees exist and are used for analysis, neighbour-joining method has been designated most reliable tree construction method especially when dealing with closely related strains under varying rates of evolution  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
from our study we can conclude that root endophytic fungi play very important roles for supporting their host plants. under environmental stress condition like that of coastal zones, waterlogged and barren lands with few plants, the endophytic fungi with extraordinary metabolites might be isolated and identified, and their metabolites can be used for human and environmental benefits. further studies with p. citrinum kacc <dig> regarding characterization of gas encoding genes and optimization of gas production media are suggested.
