BACKGROUND
carp is one of the world’s most important group of aquaculture species, with production of rohu carp  accounting for around  <dig>  million tonnes in  <dig>  <cit> . production occurs in india, bangladesh, myanmar, laos and thailand and most of the fish is consumed within these countries. a selective breeding program established by the central institute of freshwater aquaculture in bhubaneswar india has a focus on increasing the growth rate of the fish and has been supplying a genetically improved variety of l. rohita called jayanti rohu to the farmers and hatcheries of various states in india since  <dig>  a 17% percent higher average growth rate per generation was achieved after  <dig> generations of selective breeding  <cit>  and eight generations of selection have now been completed with a similar selection response. rohu is efficiently grown in earthen ponds, however disease prevention in this environment is difficult, and mortality and growth loss from disease in india is high.

aeromonas hydrophila is an endemic motile pathogenic bacteria causing haemorrhaging and ulceration when fish are stressed as reviewed by  <cit> . a. hydrophila is widespread and difficult to control and treat as there are no effective drugs or vaccines. the disease aeromoniasis caused by a. hydrophila infection is a world-wide problem affecting many fish species. significant additive genetic variation affecting the survival of rohu exposed to experimental challenge tests with a. hydrophila has been found  <cit> ; however, rohu is not an ideal model species for studying the genetics of disease resistance. mortalities occur quickly  and differences in the challenge infection procedure are believed to affect expression of the genetic potential to survive this disease. even so, one generation of divergent selection based on challenge test data has been shown to result in significantly higher average rates of survival , blood phagocyte respiratory burst activity, serum myeloperoxidase activity and ceruloplasmin level in resistant compared to susceptible line rohu  <cit> . a major limitation to selective breeding is the inability to directly test highly valuable broodstock by challenging them to the disease.

knowledge about causative genes, or markers associated with genes affecting disease resistance, could be used to increase the rate of genetic improvement through selective breeding. markers for disease resistance have been detected and applied to the selective breeding of other teleost species  <cit> , but little knowledge exists for l. rohita, and resources needed to develop such tests  have been lacking. rna-sequencing has recently been performed to characterise the transcriptomes of selected lines of l. rohita, and to concurrently identify snps and indels in transcribed genes  <cit> . quantitative analysis of rna-seq data revealed that lines of rohu selected for resistance to a. hydrophila showed higher fold naïve expression and allele frequency differences for a number of genes with putative functions affecting immune response when compared to lines selected for susceptibility to a. hydrophila. these genes included major histocompatibility class i loci, heat shock proteins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  glycoproteins, serum lectin and galactoside-binding soluble lectin. ceruloplasmin is  <dig>  times more highly expressed in resistant than in susceptible line rohu carp that were selected based on family challenge test survival to a. hydrophila <cit> . snp polymorphisms at superoxide dismutase  <dig>  an antioxidant enzyme, has also been found to be associated with resistance to a. hydrophila in the freshwater mussel hyriopsis cumingii <cit> .

here we genotype full-sibling families using an illumina iselect array containing snps found in transcribed genes, in order to produce a genetic linkage map of the l. rohita genome and simultaneously scan the genome of challenge tested families for variation associated with resistance to a. hydrophila.

RESULTS
linkage map
a conversion rate of  <dig> % meant that the snp-array used in this study contained  <dig>  of the original  <dig>  assays . after automatic and manual clustering,  <dig> markers  fell into the usable “snp” marker category, with the remainder being fails, monomorphic or low call-confidence markers. approximately 2% of markers did not segregate according to mendelian expectations in some of the  <dig> families genotyped .

in total,  <dig> informative snp markers mapped to  <dig> linkage groups . the female and male maps contained  <dig> and  <dig> snp markers respectively and  <dig> snp markers were informative for both maps.

the female linkage map covered 1384 cm with an average interval of  <dig>  cm and a maximum interval of  <dig>  cm . the length of the  <dig> linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm and the number of markers varied from  <dig> to  <dig> per group. the genome length estimate for the female was 1407 cm resulting in coverage of 99% of the genome within 1 cm of a framework marker.

the male linkage map covered  <dig>  cm with an average interval of  <dig>  cm and a maximum interval of  <dig>  cm . the length of the linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm and the number of markers varied from  <dig> to  <dig> per group. the genome length estimate for the male was 1416 cm resulting in coverage of 99% of the genome within 1 cm of a framework marker.

little difference was detected between the total lengths and map distances between the male and female specific maps . the male map was 9 cm longer than the female map,  <dig> female informative markers were linked in the female map but unlinked in the male map, while  <dig> male informative markers were linked on the male map but not the female map.

overall, l. rohita linkage groups 1– <dig> corresponded with d. rerio chromosome numbers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. there was strong correspondence between the order of genes within linkage groups for l. rohita and the order of the same genes within chromosomes in danio rerio  although some differences in the ordering of blocks of genes within l. rohita linkage groups, compared to d. rerio chromosomes, were observed. for instance, the gene order from  <dig> – 47 cm of lg <dig> in l. rohita corresponds to much the same order as from  <dig> ,337 bp –  <dig>  bp of chromosome  <dig> in d. rerio, except that the block of genes between positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,460 bp on chromosome  <dig> in d. rerio run from  <dig>  –  <dig>  cm in l. rohita linkage group  <dig>  indicating that there has been a rearrangement at the end of this linkage group/chromosome. the similarity between l. rohita and d. rerio gene sequences was on average 87% . forty-one percent of the mapped l. rohita snps were annotated with gene identity using blast .

challenge tests
the most susceptible and resistant 20% of animals from each of the challenge tested families were sampled for dna extraction and a random set of these selected for genotyping giving an overall mean survival  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sd hours post a. hydrophila challenge. the spread of hours survival ranged from  <dig> to 26 hours. plots of hours survival for the animals genotyped within each of the  <dig> full-sibling family groups that were challenged and sampled are shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig> 

genetic parameters associated with a. hydrophila resistance
significant effects of tank and pedigree on hours of survival  and dead or alive traits  were detected. heritability of hours of survival and dead or alive traits were low  but significant . the genetic correlation between the hours of survival and dead or alive traits  was positive, high and significant .

quantitative trait loci  associated with resistance to a. hydrophila
the quality control steps excluded all markers whose inheritance was non-mendelian and all individuals who could be excluded with parentage analysis, leaving  <dig> markers and  <dig> phenotyped and genotyped progeny of  <dig> sires and  <dig> dams for association analysis. although tank and pedigree  were found to be significant fixed effects, their inclusion in the model for qtl analysis did not affect the snps found to be associated with either trait or the overall level of significance for the associations. results for the simplest model  are therefore presented here.

half-sib regression interval mapping analysis detected one genome-wide significant qtl for hours of survival on lg <dig>  and five suggestive qtl both hours of survival and the binary dead/alive trait . in only one case was a suggestive qtl detected for both traits on the same linkage group . in all cases we were able to infer that two of the seven analysed parents were segregating for the qtl.

the genome-wide association studies  detected many regions with suggestive qtl for a. hydrophila resistance for the two traits . twenty-one snps mapping to ten linkage groups , and covering possibly twelve distinct regions in total, showed significant associations with the trait hours of survival . of these, snps mapping to linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were significant at p < <dig>  level after bonferroni correction for some tests and one snp mapping to 0 cm on linkage group  <dig>  was significant at p < <dig>  after bonferroni correction for the gramma test . linkage group  <dig> corresponds to chromosome  <dig> of the d. rerio genome . genes of potential interest in terms of immune function mapping to this region of lg <dig> included dermatin sulphate epimerase .

of the snps with suggestive and significant associations with hour of mortality and alive or dead traits, several showed homology to genes of known immune function . snp 55086_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  showed homology to small heat shock protein, 87896_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  to complement protein component c7- <dig>  31265_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  to cd <dig> antigen, 113696_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  to perforin  <dig>  110434_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  to t-cell antigen receptor alpha chain c region, 115737_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg  <dig>  to mucin-5b precursor, 111569_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  to tributyltin -binding protein and 554_ <dig> at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  to dipeptidyl-peptidase  <dig> . two contigs coding for mucin-5b precursor were found to be on average  <dig>  times more highly expressed in resistant line than susceptible line fish , with contig_ <dig>  around  <dig> times more differentially expressed in resistant line fish.

in addition to these noteworthy snps, some regions containing snps showing suggestive or significant associations with hour of mortality and/or alive or dead traits also contained candidate genes of interest with respect to disease resistance . snps with homology to complement c <dig>  and heat shock protein 105kd  map approximately 5 cm from small heat shock protein 55086_ <dig> on lg <dig>  which has suggestive associations with both traits . snp 16321_ <dig> with homology to the integrin alpha fg-gap repeat maps to 48 cm on lg <dig>  within 1 cm of three snps with suggestive associations on hours of survival . snp 134389_ <dig> with homology to lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase maps approximately 2 cm from snp 89585_ <dig>  on lg <dig> . snp 98520_ <dig> with homology to proteasome subunit beta type- <dig> precursor maps to the same position,  <dig>  cm along lg <dig>  as snp 4797_ <dig>  . snps 111876_ <dig> and 53025_ <dig> with homology to the major histocompatibility locus i antigen  and the c-type lectin receptor c map to 13 cm and 18 cm on lg <dig> respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm from snps 4797_ <dig>  and 83820_ <dig>  respectively . a snp with homology to e <dig> ubiquitin ligase  occurs at the same location as snp 62374_ <dig> , while another snp with homology to immunity related gtpase e <dig>  maps to the same position as snp 87974_ <dig>  on lg <dig> . snp 117051_ <dig> with homology to ubiquitination factor e4b isoform  <dig> maps between two snps with suggestive associations,  <dig>  cm distant from snp 82862_ <dig>  and  <dig>  cm distant from 54734_ <dig>  on lg <dig> . snps 17842_ <dig>  53178_ <dig> and 69593_ <dig> all share homology with mucin  <dig> protein and map  <dig>  cm from snp 55609_ <dig>  on lg <dig> . snp 110434_ <dig> with homology to the alpha chain c region of the t cell antigen receptor  maps  <dig>  cm from snps 54100_ <dig>  and 60130_ <dig>  on lg <dig> . snp 133571_ <dig> with homology to mhc class ii antigen beta chain maps  <dig>  cm from 100422_ <dig>  and snp 52577_ <dig> with homology to heat shock protein  <dig> maps  <dig>  cm from snp 75070_ <dig>  on lg <dig> . snp 2465_ <dig> with homology to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> c maps  <dig>  cm from snp 111636_ <dig>  on lg <dig> . snp 83239_ <dig> with homology to fish virus induced trim protein maps between two snps with suggestive associations,  <dig>  cm from 554_ <dig> and  <dig>  cm distant from snp 58881_ <dig>  on lg <dig> .

temporal gene expression changes with a. hydrophila infection
significant up-expression of the perforin gene was observed over the time course post-infection with a. hydrophila, particularly in rohu spleen and gill tissues . perforin was highly up-expressed  at 12 h post-infection. the expression level in spleen did not significantly differ from pre-infection levels over the rest of the time periods sampled. up-expression in the liver began 1 hour post-infection infection , was highest at 12 h post-challenge , dropped to pre-infection levels at 24 h and again slight up-regulation was noticed from  <dig> – 72 h post-infection . expression levels in gill tissue fluctuated over the time course, with up-expression at 3 h , reduced levels of expression at 6 h and 12 h, increasing to the highest level at 24 h , remaining high at 48 h , decreasing to pre-infection levels at 72 h and increasing again at  <dig> d post-infection .

discussion
this study created an extensive new snp linkage map resource for l. rohita that was used to scan the genome for polymorphisms associated with a. hydrophila resistance. the snps occur in transcribed genes and were detected by looking for variation within and between populations of l. rohita that were differentially selected for either resistance or susceptibility to a. hydrophila <cit> . this strategy was taken to maximise the possibility that some of the snps detected were the actual causative variants, or, that they would map closely to the actual causative gene variants affecting resistance to a. hydrophila.

linkage groups and genome coverage
a dense genetic linkage map for l. rohita was created containing  <dig> snps mapping to  <dig> linkage groups  corresponding to the haploid number of chromosomes in l. rohita <cit> . other linkage mapping studies for carps have estimated map lengths of widely differing sizes. for example, common carp map sizes range from 1852 cm to 5506 cm . many of these size estimates are likely to be inaccurate due to poor coverage. genome lengths for the male and female maps in this study were  <dig> and 1416 cm respectively. the haploid genome of rohu has been estimated to consist of approximately  <dig> million base pairs   <cit> . given the genome length estimate from our study we would therefore expect approximately  <dig>  million bases per cm distance in the common carp genome. pairwise recombination rates between informative linked markers were not significantly different for male compared to female meiosis.

more than 90% of blast search homology for the snp annotation was with genes in the zebra fish  genome  <cit> . the correspondence between the organisation of these two genomes was determined by comparing the linkage map positions of annotated l. rohita snps to the chromosomal position of the same genes in d. rerio. some chromosomal rearrangement since these species diverged from a common ancestor some 10– <dig> million years ago  <cit>  was observed . a few scattered genes mapped to different d. rerio chromosomes than neighbouring genes on the l. rohita linkage map. this may be due to actual chromosome rearrangements  or due to errors of identification caused by blast similarity with closely related gene sequences on other chromosomes. most of these differences occur towards the end of the l. rohita linkage groups which is also where rearrangements of large blocks of genes within linkage groups/chromosomes were detected . the gene sequences themselves shared high similarity .

candidate genes mapping to qtl regions
a number of snps in contigs with homology to genes of known immune function were found to either be the snps, or map closely  to snps, with suggestive  or significant  associations with hours of survival and/or dead or alive traits after challenge with a. hydrophila .

the ubiquitin-protein ligases or e <dig> enzymes  are a diverse group of enzymes that, as part of an enzyme cascade, attach ubiquitin to a lysine on the target protein resulting in poly- or mono-ubiquination which targets specific protein substrates for degradation by the proteasome   <cit> . more than  <dig> distinct e <dig> enzymes have been found in mammals. silencing of ubiquitin ligase associated proteins has been shown to affect disease resistance in plants  <cit> . a snp coding for e <dig> ubiquitin ligase occurs at the same map position around  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> as snp 62374_ <dig> which is significantly associated with hours of survival .

the proteasome is a large complex which catalyses the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, a process requiring atp to unfold and translocate the substrate into the core of the proteasome for proteolysis  <cit> . the architecture of the proteasome ensures that only those molecules which are targeted for degradation are affected and the proteolytic enzymes at the core of the proteasome cleave peptide bonds with broad specificity. with degradation of intracellular proteins by the proteasome, some of the by-products are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum where they bind to major histocompatibility class i molecules and result in antibody production  <cit> . variation in the proteasome subunit genes  which affects the structure and function of the proteasome could therefore have downstream effects on cellular immunity.

lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase  is highly expressed in the thymus, initiates tyrosine phosphorylation cascade in t-cells and plays a crucial role in t-cell maturation, signalling and hence immunity  <cit> . the basic mechanisms that regulate expression of this gene have been shown to be highly conserved between teleost fish and mammals  <cit> .

the major histocompatibility class i antigen  alerts the immune system to the presence of foreign material inside a cell. mhc i presenting proteins  occur on the cell surface. the mhc ii interacting molecule cd <dig> communicates with t-cell receptors, and it is mhc ii  that is known to mainly fight bacterial pathogens  <cit> , although mhc i has evolved mhc ii type functionality in some fish species such as atlantic cod gadus morhua <cit> . three mhc class i alleles have been found to be associated with improved resistance and four mhc class ii alleles were found to be associated with increased susceptibility of atlantic salmon to aeromonas salmonicida infection  <cit> . fixed allele frequency differences were detected for several mhc i snps, including snp 111876_ <dig> which mapped  <dig>  cm from the qtl detected on lg <dig>  between samples from lines of rohu that were selected for resistance or susceptibility to a. hydrophila <cit> . more than 5-fold up- or down-regulation of mhc i transcripts was also detected in the resistant line fish using mrna-seq and differential expression was confirmed for one transcript  in the skin, gill and intestine using rt qpcr  <cit> .

the highly variable alpha chain of the t cell receptor  occurs on the surface of t lymphocytes, and along with the beta chain, recognises antigens bound to mhc molecules. two c alpha chain molecules have been detected in common carp   <cit> . a. hydrophila has been found to significantly increase the expression of beta chain t cell antigen receptors in nile tilapia peripheral blood leukocytes grown in culture  <cit> . activation of invariant natural killer t cells, with an invariant t-cell antigen receptor alpha chain, have been proposed as attractive targets for developing new vaccines for infectious diseases because of their ability to recognise glycolipid antigens from pathogenic bacteria including streptococcus pneumonia <cit> .

heat shock 70 kda  binds to antigen presenting cells via toll-like receptors and leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and broad immunostimulation  <cit> . hsp <dig> acts as an intracellular chaperone, which stabilises proteins, giving them a possible role in general stress tolerance. this protein plays a role in cell proliferation, stress response and maintenance of the mitochondria. seven contigs with homology to hsp <dig> were up-regulated more than 3-fold  in resistant compared to susceptible line rohu  <cit> . heat shock protein 105/ <dig>  is a member of the hsp <dig> family of molecular chaperones which functionally relates to heat shock cognate protein  <dig>  and hsp <dig>  and is known to prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins in cells under severe stress  <cit> . hsp <dig> , like hsp <dig>  is believed to play an important role in the control of the immune response  <cit> .

a number of genes with putative functions affecting mucous secretions  were associated with qtl of significant or suggestive association with the two traits. two rohu contigs with homology to the mucin-5b precursor gene  were on average  <dig>  times more highly expressed in resistant line than susceptible line fish . five contigs with homology to mucin  <dig>  were on average  <dig>  more highly expressed in resistant line than susceptible line rohu . high molecular weight glycoprotein polymers called mucins are found on the outer body surfaces and intestine of fish. these glycoproteins form a highly viscous gel that protects the epithelium from microbial and other disturbances. common carp increase the amount and total glycosylation of high molecular weight glycoproteins in the skin in response to increased bacterial loads  <cit> . twenty-six contigs with homology to zona pellucida glycoprotein have been found to show two- to seven-fold higher expression  in resistant compared to susceptible line rohu  <cit> . choriogenin is another high molecular weight glycoprotein and was found to be  <dig>  times more highly expressed in resistant compared to susceptible line rohu  <cit> . higher expression of these glycoprotein genes could result in the secretion of greater quantities of glycoproteins, including mucin, on the skin and gut surface leading to greater protection and readiness against bacterial disease.

serum lectins  are found in the mucus and have been shown to agglutinate with and alter the viability and pathogenicity of gram-negative bacteria including a. hydrophila <cit> . seven-fold higher expression of the serum lectin isoform  <dig> precursor gene was detected in resistant line than susceptible line rohu, and alternative isoforms of galactoside-binding soluble lectin  <dig> in resistant and susceptible line rohu were detected by  <cit> . along with a higher production of mucin, higher production of lectins found in the mucus of the skin and gut could lead to a greater preparedness to combat and resist infection by bacterial pathogens. cluster of differentiation  <dig>  is a lectin that is found on the surface of mature b cells and prevents over activation of the immune system  <cit> . cd <dig> is a negative regulator of antigen receptor signaling in b cells. in mice cd <dig> is down-regulated on wild-type b- <dig> cells in response to lps  <cit> .

tributyltin binding protein  is a glycoprotein  that is believed to be involved in the transportation, detoxification and excretion of xenobiotic compounds such as tributyltin in the blood of japanese flounder  <cit> . tributyltin-binding protein is excreted from the body of japanese flounder via the skin mucus. tributyltin-binding protein is up-expressed more than four fold in the spleen of turbot 3 days after challenge with aeromonas salmonicida <cit> .

complement protein component c <dig>  plays an important role in the membrane attack system of the innate and adaptive immune response by serving as a membrane anchor, facilitating the formation of pores in the plasma membrane of target cells  <cit> . in a condition known as complement component  <dig> deficiency, human patients are more susceptible to recurrent infections, particularly to bacterial diseases such as caused by meningococcal infection  <cit> .

other genes with putative immune function with snps of interest included pore forming protein  which is a key molecule involved in t-cell and natural killer-cell-mediated cytolysis, inserting itself into the target membrane forming a pore which allows cytolytic proteins to enter the cell and trigger it to self-destruct  <cit> , dipeptidylpeptidase  <dig>  which suppresses apoptosis of resting lymphocytes  <cit>  and immunity related gtpase e <dig>  which is one of a family of proteins that are activated as part of an early immune response  and that localises to and disrupts the phagocytic vacuole during infection. large temporal changes in perforin gene expression post-infection were detected by quantitative real-time pcr in spleen  and gill tissue . along with linkage and genome-wide association evidence for a qtl mapping to the perforin gene region on lg <dig> , these patterns suggest that differential expression of the perforin gene itself could play an important role in the immune defense of l. rohita against a. hydrophila infection, and that polymorphisms affecting the expression of this gene during the time course of infection could influence disease resistance.

comparison of traits and tests
in all cases except one, the position of qtl mapped using half-sib regression analysis co-located within 10 cm of a nominally significant snp in the gwas analysis for the two traits. in two cases on lg <dig> at 29 cm and lg <dig> at 0 cm, the qtl peak from the linkage analysis  co-located to the same position as significant snps in the gwas analysis for the hours of survival trait . there was good correspondence between the results for the assoc, fasta and qfam gwas test results . as the challenge tests were performed for the different families over different total time frames it was not valid to compare hours of survival between families using the “total” option in qfam. the concordance between the findings for the hours of survival and dead or alive trait analyses was fairly high. overall, many of the same regions  contained snps with suggestive or significant associations for both the hours of survival and dead or alive traits , heritability estimates for both traits were similar  and the genetic correlation between the two traits was high and positive , indicating that the same underlying genetic mechanisms may be affecting these traits.

as the heritability of hours of survival and dead or alive post-challenge with a. hydrophila is low   <cit>  this is likely to be a polygenic trait influenced by the small additive effects of many genes and by the environment. polymorphisms affecting the regulation of expression or amino acid structure of the proteins expressed by the immune genes highlighted in this study could be the type of causative mutations contributing to overall a. hydrophila resistance in l. rohita. it is not possible to identify the causative mutations from the results of this current study, but the genes and linkage group regions highlighted here provide clues that will direct the focus of future investigations, and provide potentially useful loci for marker assisted selection to improve a. hydrophila resistance in this and related species.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, an important resource has been developed and used to screen the l. rohita genome for quantitative trait loci associated with disease resistance. mrna-seq was used by a previous study to identify snps in transcribed genes using samples from susceptible and resistant line rohu  <cit> . in the current study  <dig> of these snps were mapped to  <dig> linkage groups  and used to detect quantitative trait loci associated with resistance to a. hydrophila. associations with resistance to a. hydrophila of significance after bonferroni correction mapped to linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  genes of immune function mapping closely to these qtl include heat shock protein  <dig>  heat shock protein  <dig>  heat shock protein  <dig>  “small heat shock protein”, mucin 5b precursor, mucin  <dig>  lectin receptor, cd <dig>  tributyltin-binding protein, major histocompatibility loci i, major histocompatibility ii, complement protein component c7- <dig>  perforin, ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitination factor e4b isoform  <dig>  ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme e <dig> c, proteasome subunit, t-cell antigen receptor and lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase. the snps detected in association with disease resistance traits could be useful markers for improving the disease resistance of farmed rohu populations with selective breeding. they may also prove to be useful markers for aeromoniasis resistance in closely related species such as common carp. further work should be undertaken to confirm the associations detected in rohu carp and to determine whether the results are transferrable to other carp species. genes of putative immune function mapping closely to these qtl provide leads for future work aiming to improve our understanding of the causative genetic variants affecting disease resistance. knock-out gene studies on rohu, or on closely related model species such as zebra fish, could be used to determine whether the regulation of expression of these genes affects disease resistance, or whether other functional differences are involved. elucidating the precise immune function of these genes will be a challenge, but such knowledge could hold large benefits for the world’s aquaculture production, which relies so heavily on carp species affected by this disease.
