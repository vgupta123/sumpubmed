BACKGROUND
resistance of streptococci and enterococci to different classes of antimicrobials is increasing worldwide  <cit> . reduced susceptibility or resistance to penicillin and other β-lactams have been reported with particular frequency in the case of streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci  <cit> . resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones has been described in viridans and β-hemolytic streptococci  <cit> . notably, glycopeptide resistance is an increasing threat among enterococcal species, especially enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis  <cit> .

since clinical isolates of all the above species may produce severe infections , rapid and accurate identification  and antimicrobial susceptibility testing  are of great significance. for these bacteria, evaluation of drug susceptibility using disk diffusion methods can be problematic since the technique does not provide quantitative values. in this context, the clinical laboratory standards institute  established that s. pneumoniae isolates should not be reported as penicillin-resistant or intermediate based solely on an oxacillin zone ≤  <dig> mm  <cit> . for these strains, minimum inhibitory concentration  values of penicillin and cefotaxime/ceftriaxone or meropenem are mandatory. correct detection of vancomycin resistance among enterococci is also critical, since diffusion is difficult for large molecules and interpretative criteria are based on limited differences in the inhibition zone. mic values may be of further assistance in discriminating enterococcal species carrying different van-type determinants.

reproducibility of results, accuracy of species id, precision of quantitative ast results, turnaround time, availability of data for epidemiological monitoring, and cost-effectiveness represent compelling reasons that support the choice of an automated system for clinical bacteriology. systems of this type are now available for catalase-negative gram-positive cocci  <cit> . in the year  <dig>  becton dickinson  introduced the phoenix automated microbiology system for id and ast of gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, and enterococci  <cit> . more recently, a panel for streptococcal species  has been added  <cit> .

the present study was designed to evaluate the performance of the phoenix system for the quantitative determination of drug susceptibility of streptococcal and enterococcal isolates carrying different resistance determinants. time to results was also analyzed.

RESULTS
bacterial isolates are listed in table  <dig>  ast results are expressed as raw data . for streptococcal isolates , the overall essential agreement  and categorical agreement  between the phoenix system and the etest method were satisfactory. no vme were produced. very low rates of major errors  and minor errors  were found. for enterococcal isolates , the overall ea and ca were 97% and 96%, respectively. small numbers of errors were found: vme , me , me .

as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the overall performance for different antimicrobials was rather satisfactory . poor performances were, however, noticed for streptococci in the case of clindamycin  and erythromycin , and for enterococci in the case of teicoplanin . ca rates ≥ 97% and ≥ 94% were obtained for streptococci and enterococci, respectively. however, the low ca rate obtained in the case of linezolid for enterococci  should be noticed.

time to results 
ttr values represent the overall time required for both id and ast results. the mean ttr ± sd was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h, with minor differences between streptococci  and enterococci . among streptococci, β-hemolytic species showed the lowest ttr . s. pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were characterized by longer ttr . among enterococci, ttr was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h for e. faecalis, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h for e. faecium.

discussion
over  <dig> streptococcal and enterococcal species have been implicated in animal and/or human infections  <cit> . of these, only a few cause important human infections .

streptococcal and enterococcal isolates characterized by a wide spectrum of drug susceptibility have been investigated to assess the performance of the phoenix system using both the new smic/id- <dig> panel for streptococci and the established pmic/id- <dig> panel for enterococci. both panels allowed testing clinically-relevant drugs: penicillins, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, and the newer molecules linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin.

the results demonstrate the overall satisfactory performance of the phoenix system. ca and ea values were consistently > 90% . the lowest ca values were obtained with s. pneumoniae and with enterococci other than e. faecalis and e. faecium.

for streptococci, results in agreement with ours have been obtained by japanese investigators  <cit>  that used smic/id panels differing from those used by us. as compared to the automated vitek system, the phoenix appeared more accurate in determining mic values for pneumococci  <cit> . excellent results were obtained with both systems with regard to s. agalactiae  <cit> . among enterococci, our results showed lower performances with respect to what has been reported by others using both the phoenix and the vitek systems  <cit> . in this respect, it should be noted that a high proportion  of our isolates carried glycopeptide resistance determinants and that 17/ <dig> isolates were of species other than e. faecalis and e. faecium. problems with ast results for the above species have also been reported by others using automated systems  <cit> .

unsatisfactory results have been obtained for clindamycin in the case of streptococci : mic values produced by the phoenix were, in fact, usually lower than those obtained with the etest. investigated strains, however, showed mics consistently within breakpoint values, thus limiting the clinical impact of the error. the reduced response to clindamycin was not related to the expression of resistance determinants . overall, small numbers of vme and me were obtained. most errors were classified as me, due to minor differences in mic values around breakpoint concentrations. regarding ten enterococcal isolates, the phoenix system gave mic values of  <dig> μg/ml for linezolid, thus classifying the isolates as "intermediate". mic values given by the etest were instead of  <dig> μg/ml . the finding appears to reflect a problem already noticed by phoenix users with regard to this drug. thus, increased linezolid mics need to be verified using a reference method. regarding penicillin, me were encountered in 6/ <dig> streptococci. in the latter cases, mics were overestimated by the phoenix system. overall, the results of the present study were superior to those previously reported for both the phoenix and the vitek  <dig> system  <cit> .

a me rate < 10% is recommended for accepting ast results, and up to  <dig> % me and  <dig> % vme are acceptable  <cit> . overall, the results produced by the phoenix were well within the recommended range. however, an me rate of  <dig> % was obtained for enterococci other than e. faecium and e. faecalis.

CONCLUSIONS
the phoenix system appears an effective diagnostic tool for infections caused by streptococci and enterococci. panels based on dilution tests were able to deliver adequate quantitative ast results in short times. this is especially relevant for severe infections caused by aggressive species such as s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, and e. faecium. for these organisms, interpretation of susceptibility data varies according to the infection site and – in the case of large molecules that hardly diffuse in solid media  – results obtained using dilution methods are to be preferred  <cit> .
