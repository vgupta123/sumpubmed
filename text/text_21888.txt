BACKGROUND
succinate dehydrogenase  is an essential enzyme complex that has dual roles in the krebs cycle and the electron transport chain  in mitochondria  <cit> . sdh is composed of four subunits encoded by the nuclear genes sdha, sdhb, sdhc, and sdhd. sdha at chromosome band 5p <dig> and sdhb at chromosome band 1p <dig> encode the two catalytical hydrophilic subunits flavoprotein  and iron-sulfur , respectively. sdhc at chromosome band 1q <dig> and sdhd at chromosome 11q <dig> encode the two membrane-spanning hydrophobic subunits, cybl  and cybs , respectively. the sdha, sdhb, sdhc, and sdhd gene products are encoded by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> exons, which span genomic distances of ~ <dig> kb,  <dig> kb,  <dig> kb. and  <dig> kb, respectively  <cit> .

the identification of the sdhd subunit gene as the hereditary paraganglioma type  <dig> locus  has uncovered unexpected links between sdh and tumor susceptibility, and highlighted the role of mitochondria in cancer  <cit> . since then, mutations in sdhb, sdhc, and sdhd subunit genes  have been established as an important cause of sporadic and familial paragangliomas  <cit> . the paraganglia specificity of pgl tumors  <cit>  and data from global gene-expression analysis  <cit> , cell biology  <cit> , animal-model studies  <cit> , and gene-environment interaction and population genetics  <cit>  support the hypothesis that constitutive hypoxic stimulation underlies the pathogenesis of pgl.

the role of sdh in disease pathogenesis has been implicated independently through a series of studies on a widely distributed plant and fungal neurotoxin, 3-nitropropionic acid  <cit> . acute food poisoning with 3-npa, which can lead to central nervous system defects with lifelong disability and to mortality in ~10% of the cases, have been associated with consumption of moldy sugarcanes in china  <cit> . the neurodegeneration induced by 3-npa poisoning often involves the basal ganglia, hippocampus, spinal tracts, and peripheral nerves, and the symptoms mimic those of huntington's disease  <cit> . 3-npa irreversibly inhibits sdh, owing to the similarity of the chemical structures of 3-npa to succinate  <cit> . it has been suggested that 3-npa may form a covalent adduct with an arginine residue at amino acid position  <dig> in the active site of the fp subunit  <cit> .

surprisingly, mutations in the major catalytical subunit sdha have yet to be associated with pgl. although homozygous mutations in sdha have been found in leigh syndrome  <cit> , a severe neurodegenerative disorder of childhood, and with neuromusculopathies, no genetic link between sdha and paraganglioma susceptibility has ever been established. current biochemical knowledge on sdh provides very few clues for the phenotypic dichotomy arising from the germline subunit gene mutations. sdha and sdhb subunits encode the two physically-interacting catalytical subunits, so it is surprising that their mutations would have such different phenotypic consequences  <cit> . recently, after identifying cdna sequences encoding a missense fp variant containing the y629f and v657i polymorphisms, tomitsuka et al  <cit>  proposed that distinct genetic loci encode two fp variants, namely type i and type ii. they reached this conclusion after observing tissue-specific and cell line-specific differential expression of the cdna variants and pcr amplification from genomic dna of processed sdha gene fragments that lacked introns . however, the genomic location of the retrogene that was proposed to encode the second sdha gene could not be determined. a retrogene for sdha is not present in the human genome, according to the march  <dig> assembly in the ucsc database.  <cit>  finally, briere et al  <cit>  showed the presence of the missense sdha variants in several different cell types and assumed that these variants originate from two different genes, although they provided no experimental or bioinformatic evidence for the genomic presence of a second sdha locus. briere et al  <cit>  suggested that the presence of two sdha genes in paraganglia prevents tumorigenesis. if fp were encoded by two different loci, this would indeed have provided a simple explanation for why sdha mutations would not be associated with pgl susceptibility.

an alternative approach to gain insights into gene function involves analysis of sequence variation in the population. to date, no study has systematically addressed the variation patterns in the sdh subunit genes in normal subjects from different racial or ethnic groups. to gain further insights into the multiple roles of sdh in disease predisposition and to help to integrate the seemingly disparate phenotypic consequences of sdh subunit defects, we examined sequence variation in the complete coding and partial flanking intronic sequences of the four sdh subunit genes in  <dig> samples from an african american population and  <dig> samples from a white population. these analyses uncovered an unexpected degree of nucleotide diversity in the sdha gene.

RESULTS
sequence variants in the sdh subunit genes
using pcr, each coding exon and the flanking introns of the four sdh subunit genes in  <dig> european american and  <dig> african american samples were amplified, and were then sequenced. in total,  <dig> coding and  <dig> non-coding nucleotides were sequenced for each sample, and  <dig> polymorphisms were detected . the heterozygous frequencies of all variants were consistent with hardy-weinberg expectations  in both sets of samples. except for two non-coding indels in sdha and one in sdhc, all variants were single nucleotide polymorphisms  involving base replacements. a full list of the identified sequence variants is provided in additional file  <dig> and has also been submitted to the sdh mutation database  <cit> . sdha variant density was  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher in the coding and non-coding regions, respectively, than the average of  <dig> genes  <cit> . the minor allele frequencies of all variants are shown in figure  <dig> 

nucleotide diversity in sdh subunit genes
we calculated the nucleotide diversity in sdh subunit genes using the population genetic parameters π and θs . as expected, all diversity indices were higher in the african american samples. the nucleotide diversity  in the total sample set was low at the pgl genes: sdhb , sdhc , and sdhd . in contrast, the nucleotide diversity of the sdha gene  was  <dig> -fold higher than the average of the pgl genes and  <dig> -fold higher than the average  of  <dig> autosomal genes  <cit> . the θs and π estimates of nucleotide diversities were similar for the membrane-spanning subunits sdhc and sdhd, but differed substantially for the two catalytic subunits. whereas the π estimate was ~ <dig> -fold higher than θs for the sdha gene, consistent with the enrichment of alleles with intermediate frequencies, the θs estimate was ~4-fold higher for the sdhb gene, indicating the very low frequency of the allelic variants. for comparison, 90% of the genes in a recent survey had θs estimates higher than the π estimates  <cit> , indicating an abundance of rare alleles, which is thought to be a result of recent population expansion in humans. fst statistics provided statistically significant evidence of population differentiation between the two racial groups for the sdha, sdhc, and sdhd genes, but not for the sdhb gene . this was attributable to the very low frequencies and the absence of sdhb allelic variants in the african american and european american samples, respectively.

comparison of the human and chimpanzee sdha genes for sequence diversity
to test whether high nucleotide diversity also characterizes the chimpanzee sdha gene, we used the human pcr primers to amplify and sequence  <dig> unrelated chimpanzee samples. we obtained high-quality sequences for exons 3– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which together comprise a total genomic sequence size of  <dig> bp . we identified one silent exonic and seven intronic fixed-nucleotide differences between the human and chimpanzee sdha genes , corresponding to a substitution rate of  <dig> %. the nucleotide substitution rate in sdha is lower than the average of  <dig> known genes  that were recently sequenced in human and chimpanzee  <cit> . the chimpanzee sdha gene has  <dig> polymorphic variants, compared with  <dig> in the human gene in the same region, and showed ~ <dig> -fold lower nucleotide diversity  than the human gene . furthermore, θs and π estimates of nucleotide diversities were similar in the chimpanzee, consistent with neutral expectations. these findings indicate that the mutation rate in sdha is not inherently high and that the increased nucleotide diversity in the human gene must have occurred after the split of the two species from their common ancestor 5– <dig> million years ago.

tests of neutrality
we employed three commonly used tests  to identify departures of the allelic distributions from neutral expectations. none of the pgl genes showed statistically significant departures from neutrality in samples from either racial group . in contrast, the allelic distribution of the sdha gene showed positive test values at statistically significant levels in both racial samples . notably, the neutrality statistics were supportive of balancing selection on sdha despite the presence of six singleton variants in the african american samples and one singleton variant in the european american samples . to obtain a clearer picture of the departure of sdha allelic distributions from neutral expectations, we analyzed non-coding, coding, synonymous, and non-synonymous variants separately . nominally significant departures from neutrality were obtained in seven of the nine test statistics for the non-coding variants, although the sdha coding region variation was also suggestive of an excess of variants in intermediate frequencies in the african american samples.

to test whether the level of silent diversity in sdha correlates with level of divergence between human and chimpanzee, as predicted by the neutral theory, we used the hudson-kreitman-aguadé  test. sequence data from four loci that were assumed to be evolving neutrally were used for comparison. these loci include non-coding regions on chromosome bands 1q <dig>  <cit> , 22q <dig>  <cit> , and xq <dig>   <cit>  and the promoter region of β-globin at 11p <dig>  <cit> . locus-by-locus comparison provided statistical significance in two of the four tests, suggesting increased diversity in sdha relative to these two loci . to further address whether the sdha variation pattern is unusual when information from the comparison loci is jointly used, we used a recently developed maximum-likelihood-ratio test  <cit> . the likelihood of two models were compared; the first assumes that all five loci evolve neutrally, whereas the other assumes that sdha is subject to selection while the other four loci evolve neutrally. the model assuming selection on sdha was statistically supported over the model of neutrality . these results further support the hypothesis that increased nucleotide diversity in sdha is maintained by balancing selection.

empirical assessment of neutrality in sdh subunit genes
because population history plays an important role in shaping the variation patterns in the genome, we sought to assess whether the nucleotide diversity of complex ii genes were unusual compared with other genes across the genome. we used the summary statistics for tajima's d test and nucleotide diversity of  <dig> genes listed in the seattlesnp database for comparison. when compared with the database genes, the statistics for nucleotide diversity and tajima's d were not outstanding for any of the complex ii genes in the european american samples or for the sdhc and sdhd genes in the african american samples. however, the sdha nucleotide diversity was higher than that of  <dig>  of the genes and the tajima d statistic was higher than that of  <dig>  of the genes in the african american samples . in contrast, sdhb had less sequence diversity than  <dig> of the seattlesnp genes  in the african american samples. a recent analysis of  <dig> loci in the seattlesnp set has indicated that the d statistic of the abo locus  retains its significance in an african american population under several demographic scenarios  <cit> . because the magnitude of d in sdha in our african american samples  is higher than that in the abo locus , it is likely that the statistical support for balancing selection on sdha would be retained by different population histories. in summary, the departure of sdha allelic distribution from neutral expectations is empirically supported in the african american samples, consistent with a balancing selection mechanism.

haplotype structures of the sdh subunit genes
haplotypes, haplotype-block structures and the tagging snps for each block were inferred using the web-based hap software . as expected, the haplotypes were more variable in the african american than in the european american samples. the sdha haplotype variation could be defined by  <dig> haplotype blocks and  <dig> tagging snps in the african american samples but only by  <dig> haplotype-blocks and  <dig> tagging snps in the european american samples . in contrast, haplotype variation in the pgl genes could be defined by single-haplotype blocks. the most common haplotype accounted for ~99% of the haplotypes of the pgl genes in the european american samples . similarly, the most common haplotype and its 1-nucleotide neighbors covered ~98%, 79% and 73% of the variation in the sdhb, sdhc, and sdhd genes, respectively, in the african american samples.

the commonness of a single haplotype and its 1-nucleotide neighbors in the pgl genes was in stark contrast to the presence of two common but highly dissimilar haplotypes in sdha in both racial groups. the two most common sdha haplotypes, a <dig> and a <dig>  accounted for ~19%  and ~9%  of all haplotype diversity, respectively, and differed from each other in  <dig> of the  <dig> variant positions . haplotype a <dig> and a <dig> encode the missense fp variants y629-v <dig> and f629- <dig>  by the snps  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, indicating an allelic association of the missense variants in these two amino-acid sites. notably, the variant fp amino acids y <dig> and v <dig> were conserved in mammalian fp sequences, including orangutan, macaque, mouse, dog, rat, and bovine. however, different amino acids were found in phylogenetically more distant species such as the zebrafish, which had y629-i <dig> and dirofilaria, an infectious nematode, which had e629-i <dig> 

all of the remaining  <dig> sdha haplotypes were highly similar to one of the two commonest haplotypes, and formed two distinct haplotype sets, referred to as haplogroup  <dig> and haplogroup  <dig>  the haplotypes within each group differed from the most common haplotype of the group in up to seven variant positions, with a median number of three differences. the frequencies of haplogroups  <dig> and  <dig> were ~56% and ~44% in the african american samples and ~82% and ~18% in the european american samples, respectively. a median-joining network of all haplotypes clustered all but one haplotype within two distinct haplogroup clusters . the only haplotype  that mapped outside of the two haplogroups clusters was probably a recombination product between haplogroup  <dig> and haplogroup  <dig> 

haplotype number test
to test whether the number of predicted sdha haplotypes in the african american samples is compatible with neutral evolution, we employed the depaulis and veuille haplotype number test  <cit> . in total,  <dig> variants in  <dig> african american sequences defined  <dig> different haplotypes . using depaulis and veuille simulations under assumptions of neutrality showed that when there are  <dig> variants in  <dig> sequences, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the expected number of different haplotypes is  <dig>  thus, the number of sdha haplotypes is statistically significantly higher than expected under neutrality, and is consistent with an ancient balanced polymorphism in the african american population.

estimating age of the sdha haplogroups
we estimated the age of the two haplogroups by comparing the sequence divergence between them with that between the human and chimpanzee genes, assuming a constant evolutionary rate of nucleotide substitutions. haplogroups  <dig> and  <dig> have eight fixed nucleotide differences, at snps 8– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , within  <dig> bp, whereas human and chimpanzee genes have eight fixed nucleotide differences within  <dig> bps. on the basis of these fixed nucleotide substitutions, we estimated haplogroups  <dig> and  <dig> to be as old as  times the divergence time of human and chimpanzees. thus, sdha balanced polymorphisms were estimated to be  <dig> – <dig>  million years old, assuming a divergence time of 5– <dig> million years for human and chimpanzees. this is probably a conservative estimate, as the fixed differences between the haplogroups erode in time by recombination and gene conversion.

discussion
our results establish a foundation to understand the selective and demographic forces that have shaped the variation patterns in sdh subunit genes, and have important functional implications. our findings indicate that the variation pattern in sdha is characterized by the presence of higher sequence diversity, two common and highly dissimilar haplogroups, and statistical and empirical support for the operation of a balancing selection mechanism. our data also refute the previous suggestions that the y629f and v657i variants originate from two distinct genetic loci because these missense variants are encoded by a single, highly polymorphic sdha gene.

the pgl genes had much lower nucleotide diversity, which was especially evident in sdhb, suggesting that the sdhb gene product might be under functional constraints that preclude the accumulation of variants. if slightly deleterious variants in pgl genes increase the risk of paraganglioma tumor development, such variants would be eliminated before they reach high frequencies in the population. this potential mechanism might apply especially to sdhb because its mutations are associated with malignancy and early-onset pheochromocytomas that could lead to severe hypertensive crises  <cit> . in contrast, because there is no evidence that heterozygous mutations in sdha are associated with a pathologic phenotype, negative selection of deleterious sdha alleles may operate only when they are in the homozygous state, which often leads to a lethal metabolic syndrome in childhood.

a major finding of our study is the unexpectedly high nucleotide diversity in the sdha gene in the african american samples. it has been suggested that high local recombination rates may increase snp density  <cit> . however, this mechanism is unlikely to contribute to sdha variant density, because a recent high-resolution recombination map indicates a very low recombination rate at the tip of chromosome  <dig> short arm, where sdha is located  <cit> . it is conceivable that the four sdha pseudogenes, generated by complete or partial gene duplications, may increase the de novo mutation rate in the sdha gene through illegitimate recombination or gene conversion during meiosis to increase variant density. however, lack of high nucleotide diversity in the chimpanzee sdha gene does not suggest that the mutation rate in sdha is inherently high, even though the chimpanzee genome also contains the duplicated sdha pseudogenes. rather, our findings suggest that the high nucleotide diversity of the human sdha gene is a consequence of persistence of two distinct haplogroups for long periods during human evolution, leading to acquisition of a distinct set of polymorphisms by each haplogroup.

the most important finding of our study is the statistical and empirical support for a balancing selection mechanism on sdha. a classic example of balancing selection is found at the major histocompatibility complex  loci  <cit> , where high levels of polymorphisms in the functional mhc genes may confer a selective advantage to the heterozygotes by enabling them to process a wider range of pathogen antigens on t cells. the variation in a few other human genes may also have been shaped by balancing selection. for example, the 5' cis-regulatory region of ccr <dig>  encoding the principal coreceptor for hiv- <dig>  <cit> , protocadherin alpha gene cluster promoters  <cit>  and the bitter-taste receptor gene, ptc  <cit> , have two major ancient haplotype groups and positive d test statistics, similar to sdha. however, in contrast to sdha, these genes did not show significant tajima d statistics in the african or african american samples. in general, the average tajima d value is positive in the european american population and negative in the african american population. positive tajima d statistics in european americans are often interpreted to reflect population contraction that occurred during the migration of modern humans out of africa, whereas negative tajima d statistics in african americans may reflect admixture between african and european populations  <cit> . thus, evidence of balancing selection on a gene, suggested by statistically significantly positive tajima d values, is more likely to be confounded by population history in european american samples than in african american samples.

it is conceivable that an environmental factor prevalent in africa may have contributed to the increased frequency of certain sdha variants that might have differential roles in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis by the sdh complex. a candidate environmental factor is the neurotoxin 3-npa and its aliphatic nitrocompounds derivatives. in addition to being a product of certain fungi such as arthrinium species, 3-npa and its derivatives are also found in several higher plants. the toxicity of these plants is well established, because their aliphatic nitrocompound contents have been linked to acute and chronic diseases in some domestic animals. major livestock losses were attributed to plant nitrocompounds in the western united states, canada and mexico  <cit> . thus, although human toxicity involving moldy sugarcane poisoning have to date been reported only in china, human exposure to 3-npa and other nitrocompounds might be more common throughout the world than is indicated by the numbe of clinical cases  <cit> . 3-npa exposure might be more prevalent in africa partly because a hot and humid climate promotes the growth of fungi. if certain sdha variants confer a selective advantage against 3-npa poisoning by affecting gene expression levels, protein translation efficiency, and/or the binding affinity for 3-npa, then such variants may provide a survival advantage for their carriers against 3-npa poisoning. alternatively, sdh may play a currently unrecognized role against infectious pathogens such as malaria, which are prevalent in africa. genetic studies of pgl suggest that inactivation of sdh by subunit mutations inappropriately activates hypoxia-inducible pathways. if the sdha variants that have increased in frequency during human evolution are hypomorphs or encode fps that have slight functional deficits, these variants might promote the activation of hypoxia-inducible pathways and help the immune cells to survive better under sustained hypoxic microenvironments of the infected tissues.

finally, our findings do not support the previous explanations as to why sdha mutations are not associated with pgl susceptibility because these explanations assume the presence of two sdha genes in the human genome. instead, the contrasting patterns of sequence variation between sdha and the pgl genes suggest the presence of two functionally distinct modules in sdh: one formed by the three closely-associated pgl gene products , and the other a loosely-interacting, highly-variable sdha protein product. this model provides an alternative explanation as to why sdha mutations do not cause pgl and predicts the following two conditions:

 the relative concentration of sdha protein product is much higher  than the pgl module in the paraganglionic tissues. thus, even a 50% reduction in sdha protein levels, as a result of heterozygous mutations, would not compromise the sdh function in paraganglia to initiate tumor formation.

 the physical interaction between the sdha protein product and the pgl module is loose and kinetically fast during catalysis, thus a mutant sdha protein product could not irreversibly trap a pgl module to initiate tumor formation.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that the sdha gene carries a strong signature of balancing selection in the african american population and that pgl and sdha gene products are subject to distinct selective constraints. collectively, these data provide new insights into sdh biology and may catalyze further research on the causes and the consequences of the unexpectedly high sequence diversity in the sdha subunit gene.
