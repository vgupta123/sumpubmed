BACKGROUND
tuberculosis remains one of the leading causes of worldwide mortality and morbidity, infecting an estimated  <dig> million people annually with approximately  <dig> million deaths  <cit> . the situation regarding the control of tuberculosis has significantly worsened over the last decades, with the spread of multidrug resistant strains. in the absence of an effective vaccine for tuberculosis, there is an urgent need for the development of novel antimycobacterial agents. the study of mycobacterial biochemistry assists this development through the identification and characterization of cellular enzymes amenable to therapeutic inhibition.

polyamine synthesis and its associated methionine  regeneration pathway  are known to be potential drug targets in a variety of microorganisms  <cit> . the synthesis of polyamines is essential during periods of dna replication, although the exact physiological role of these compounds remains unclear  <cit> . the production of spermidine from putrescine, or spermine from spermidine, consumes the amino acid met in a 1: <dig> stoichiometry yielding methylthioadenosine  as a byproduct. as met biosynthesis is energetically expensive, and many organisms lack the ability to synthesize the amino acid, a unique pathway exists which recycles met from mta. to date, the entire pathway has only been fully characterised in the gram-negative bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae  <cit>  and the gram-positive bacterium bacillus subtilis  <cit>  selected individual enzymes active in the pathway have been studied in a wide variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms  <cit> . for mycobacterium spp., only methionine adenosyltransferase has been cloned, expressed, and fully characterised  <cit> .

the final step in met regeneration is the transamination of ketomethiobutyrate  by an aminotransferase. the specific aminotransferase responsible for the reaction has been identified and characterised in a number of microorganisms, including malaria, african trypanosomes, k. pneumoniae, b. subtilis, and b. anthracis  <cit> . in the lower eukaryotes plasmodium falciparum, trypanosoma brucei brucei, giardia intestinalis, and crithidia fasciculata, this reaction is catalysed by the subfamily ia enzyme aspartate aminotransferase  <cit> . in k. pneumoniae, however, the reaction was performed by the close homologue tyrosine aminotransferase, which is also a member of subfamily ia  <cit> . gram-positive bacteria and archaea appear to lack any subfamily ia homologues in their genomes, and b. subtilis, b. cereus, and b. anthracis were recently found to catalyse met regeneration via a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase   <cit> . this enzyme is a member of family iii, along with d-amino acid aminotransferase , and is unrelated structurally to family i enzymes  <cit> . intriguingly, b. subtilis and b. cereus/b. anthracis utilised bcat enzymes from separate subfamilies . as mycobacterium spp. also appear to have no subfamily ia aminotransferase sequences , it would be expected that m. tuberculosis also catalyses the conversion of kmtb to met via a bcat. in this paper, we report the identification, cloning, and functional expression of a single bcat from m. tuberculosis. in addition, this enzyme has been demonstrated to actively catalyse met formation and is subject to inhibition by a variety of aminooxy compounds.

RESULTS
branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase in m. tuberculosis
the complete, published genome of m. tuberculosis h37rv was found to contain a single gene with a very high sequence homology to either b. subtilis ybge or ywaa, which are both known to be subfamily iiia bcats  <cit> . in contrast, the tuberculosis genome did not contain a homologue to b. subtilis yhem, b. cereus bcat, or b. anthracis bcat, which are all subfamily iiib aminotransferases  <cit> . this relationship can be clearly seen in figure 2a, where selected family iii aminotransferases have been aligned and an unrooted tree constructed. the putative m. tuberculosis bcat gene, rv2210c, has not been previously cloned, expressed, or characterised. it is interesting to note that the m. tuberculosis genome contains a single bcat homologue and no obvious daat homologue.

examination of complete and incomplete genome projects for mycobacterium spp. uncovered a single gene in m. leprae, m. bovis, m. marinum, m. ulcerans, m. avium, and m. smegmatis with an extremely high identity to rv2110c. together, with other subfamily iiia aminotransferases, the putative mycobacterial sequences were aligned and a cladogram constructed . the m. tuberculosis and m. bovis sequences were identical, as were the m. marinum and m. ulcerans sequences. aside from m. bovis, all the mycobacterial bcat sequences were found to be  <dig> – 88% identical to the m. tuberculosis sequence. however, the tuberculosis sequence was 57% identical to the putative bcat from streptomyces coelicolor and 45% identical to b. subtilis ybge. figure 2b highlights the fact that the mycobacterial bcat sequences are more closely related to eukaryotic enzymes than to most other bacterial homologues. there was little sequence conservation with enzymes found in subfamily iiib, with only 27% identity to the e. coli bcat, 18% to the b. anthracis bcat, and 15% to b. subtilis yhem.

the low level of sequence conservation outside of the genus can be seen in the alignment of selected bcat sequences shown in figure  <dig>  only  <dig> residues are completely conserved across even this small sequence sampling. interestingly, of the residues found by x-ray crystallography to be important in substrate binding to the e. coli bcat  <cit> , only k <dig> and t <dig> were conserved across the  <dig> sequences in figure  <dig>  the residues in parentheses represent the corresponding position in the e. coli bcat. of these two residues, k <dig> is the plp binding site and would be expected to be invariant. if one excludes the only daat in figure  <dig>  then y <dig>  f <dig>  y <dig>  and a <dig> can be added to this conserved list of residues important for substrate binding in the e. coli bcat. clearly, sequence conservation is very low across family iii.

expression and characterization of the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase
the putative m. tuberculosis bcat was cloned as a deca-histidine fusion protein for expression in e. coli. to prevent complete inclusion of the recombinant protein, it was necessary to induce expression with a relatively low concentration of iptg  at 20°c for  <dig> hr. under these conditions, sufficient soluble material was produced and purified over ni2+ affinity columns . assay of the eluted material with  <dig> mm each of adefghiklnqrstvwy and  <dig> mm kmtb resulted in appreciable met production , demonstrating that the enzyme was active and catalysed met formation.

the purified enzyme was screened against  <dig> mm of each individual amino acid and  <dig> mm kmtb to determine the amino donor range for met regeneration. isoleucine, leucine, and valine were found to be the most effective substrates , while glutamate and phenylalanine were also active as amino donors. tyrosine and tryptophan were found to have a much lesser ability to transaminate kmtb and all other amino acids were inactive. the five most active amino donors were more closely examined in order to determine their kinetic parameters . the km for leu, ile, and val ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig>  mm, while that for glu was  <dig>  mm and phe  <dig>  mm. the vmax for all five amino acids was similar at  <dig>  –  <dig>  μmol/min/mg protein. kmtb was found to have a km of  <dig>  mm. the enzyme was also examined for branched-chain amino acid and kg aminotransfer in order characterise the "classic" reactions associated with a bcat . the km of the substrates was found to be similar, while the vmax ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig>  μmol/min/mg protein. therefore, the tuberculosis bcat catalyses aminotransfer of kg about  <dig> times more readily than kmtb. this result is similar to that seen with the b. subtilis bcat, which also transaminates kg at a higher rate than kmtb  <cit> .

inhibition studies
thirteen aminooxy compounds were assayed for inhibitory effects on the tuberculosis bcat. the enzyme was incubated with  <dig>  mm leucine,  <dig>  mm kmtb and  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm inhibitor to assay for the effect on met regeneration . with the exception of o-trimethylsilylhydroxylamine, all of the compounds inhibited met formation to some extent. the four most active compounds at  <dig>  mm were o-allylhydroxylamine, carboxymethoxylamine, o-benzylhydroxylamine, and o-t-butylhydroxylamine, and these inhibitors were further examined in order to determine ki values . for all four compounds, the inhibition data was not consistent with a simple competitive or uncompetitive model, but fit very well with a model of mixed mode inhibition  <cit> . the competitive component of inhibition yielded a kic of  <dig>  –  <dig>  μm, while the uncompetitive component gave a kiu of  <dig>  –  <dig> μm. therefore, the inhibition of the tuberculosis bcat by these four aminooxy compounds is primarily competitive.

these four inhibitors and canaline, an aminooxy analogue of ornithine that has been demonstrated to be an effective aminotransferase inhibitor in other systems  <cit> , were screened against m. tuberculosis and m. marinum in vitro to determine potential antimicrobial activity. m. marinum is a close relative of m. tuberculosis that causes a similar disease in fish, grows faster than m. tuberculosis in culture, and does not cause serious infections in humans  <cit> . as such, it is an excellent surrogate for the initial screening of antimycobacterial agents, and we wished to validate its use for aminooxy compounds. all the inhibitors were found to have some degree of antimycobacterial activity , with mic values ranging from  <dig> μm –  <dig> mm and ic <dig> values of  <dig>  μm –  <dig> μm. the best inhibitor was found to be o-allylhydroxylamine. while o-t-butylhydroxylamine and o-benzylhydroxylamine appeared to be the best enzyme inhibitors, they were significantly less effective than o-allylhydroxylamine as growth inhibitors. unlike other organisms examined to date  <cit> , canaline was not a particularly good inhibitor of both enzyme activity and cell growth. the inhibition results for m. tuberculosis and m. marinum were very similar, with mic results being identical or within  <dig> dilution. in addition, m. tuberculosis was found to have an mic of  <dig> μg/ml for streptomycin while m. marinum had one of  <dig> μg/ml.

discussion
the specific aminotransferase involved in the formation of met from kmtb has been examined in a number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms  <cit> . however, within the low-gc content gram-positive bacteria, only b. subtilis, b. cereus, and b. anthracis have been studied  <cit> . in all of these bacillus spp., a bcat has been found to be responsible for catalysing the reaction, with b. subtilis and b. cereus/b. anthracis utilising enzymes from different aminotransferase subfamilies. no member of the high-gc content gram-positive bacteria has been previously examined. like b. subtilis, m. tuberculosis has been found to catalyse met regeneration using a subfamily iiia aminotransferase. in fact, the kinetic parameters for the two aminotransferases were almost identical. the m. tuberculosis bcat had km values of  <dig>  –  <dig>  mm and vmax values of  <dig>  –  <dig>  μmol/min/mg protein for branched-chain amino acids and kmtb, while the b. subtilis ybge had the corresponding values of  <dig>  –  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  –  <dig>  μmol/min/mg protein  <cit> . for branched-chain amino acids and kg, the values were  <dig>  –  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  –  <dig>  μmol/min/mg protein for the m. tuberculosis bcat, and  <dig>  –  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  –  <dig>  μmol/min/mg protein for b. subtilis ybge  <cit> . therefore, a 45% sequence identity between the two enzymes is sufficient to conserve both the substrate range and kinetic properties of the bcats. structural information is only available for the e. coli bcat  and the human mitochondrial bcat  <cit> , but the key residues involved in substrate specificity appear to be conserved in the m. tuberculosis bcat. however, while the human mitochondrial bcat is also a family iiia aminotransferase, there are some clear differences when compared to the m. tuberculosis enzyme. the human enzyme will not accept aromatic amino acids, whereas the tuberculosis bcat would use phenylalanine as an amino donor. in addition, the human enzyme contains the redox-active motif cxxc at positions 311– <dig>  which is essential for maintaining activity, while the tuberculosis bcat lacks these residues. structural analysis of the m. tuberculosis and/or b. subtilis enzymes would clarify these issues.

the m. tuberculosis bcat was also screened with a variety of aminooxy compounds as potential inhibitors. these compounds are known aminotransferase inhibitors and act by forming a stable schiff-base with the plp cofactor  <cit> . unlike previous studies  <cit> , canaline was not found to be one of the better inhibitors of aminotransferase activity. instead, o-benzylhydroxylamine, o-t-butylhydroxylamine, carboxymethoxylamine, and o-allylhydroxylamine were the most efficient inhibitors of met formation from kmtb. in addition, these compounds demonstrated mixed type inhibition with a lower ki for the competitive component. this result contrasts with that previously found for canaline with the bacillus spp. enzymes, where inhibition was uncompetitive  <cit> . it may be possible that this difference may be due to the structure of the inhibitors, as canaline is a γ-substituted amino acid analogue, while the present inhibitors are α-substituted or non-amino acid analogues. essentially, the inhibitors examined in this study do not present an α-amino group suitable for participation in the transamination reaction whereas canaline does.

further screening of the inhibitors against m. tuberculosis and m. marinum in vitro demonstrated that the compounds can act as effective antimycobacterial agents. the close correspondence of the mic values for m. tuberculosis and m. marinum validates the use of the latter organism as a more rapid and safe initial screen of the antimycobacterial properties of aminooxy compounds. the mic values found for streptomycin against these two organisms was also found to be consistent with previously published values  <cit> . m. marinum can thus be used to quickly test a larger number of potential inhibitors, with m. tuberculosis used as a follow up for more promising candidates.

interestingly, there was no direct correlation between the ki of the compounds against recombinant m. tuberculosis bcat and the mic/ic <dig> against cell growth. it is possible that there may be differences in the uptake rate of the various compounds into viable cells. alternatively, the most effective growth inhibitors act by inhibiting other plp-dependent enzymes in addition to bcat. in any case, o-allylhydroxylamine was the most effective antimycobacterial agent with an mic of  <dig> μm against m. marinum and  <dig> μm against m. tuberculosis. unfortunately, the compound is corrosive, and is thus unsuitable for further in vivo study. however, the structure of the compound might provide the basis for the design of less toxic, more active structural analogues. in future studies, it will be necessary to examine the effect of potential inhibitors on human bcat, in order to better assess the potential for host toxicity. any further development of aminooxy compounds as antimycobacterial agents will depend on discovering a selective inhibitor for the microbial enzyme.

several older studies have been conducted on the antimicrobial effect of aminooxy compounds, with m. tuberculosis included amongst the organisms tested  <cit> . from these papers, the only compound in common with the present study was carboxymethoxylamine, which was found to have an mic of  <dig> μm ,  <dig> μm  <cit> ,  <dig> –  <dig> μm  <cit> , or  <dig> μm  <cit> . given the variety of media used in these studies for determining the mic value, the results are quite consistent. the variety of non-commercially available aminooxy compounds synthesized and tested in these older studies included aminooxy acids, aminooxy amides, aminooxy hydroxamic acids, aminooxy hydrazides, aminooxy alkanes, and aminooxy guanidines. several of these compounds were very effective growth inhibitors in vitro, with mic values as low as  <dig>  μm against m. tuberculosis. one of the compounds has been administered to mice, with favourable, albeit sparsely detailed, results with regard to toxicity and in vivo antitubercular effect  <cit> . while it is unclear what effect these inhibitors would have against the m. tuberculosis bcat, it would appear to be possible to design more effective, less toxic aminooxy compounds for use against m. tuberculosis.

several interesting findings arose during the course of this investigation. first, while m. tuberculosis has only the one branched-chain aminotransferase, it does contain a coding sequence  with a high similarity to the b. subtilis ykrv gene product. ykrv was found to be a subfamily if aminotransferase and could also catalyse the conversion of kmtb to met using glutamine as the only effective amino donor  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the rv0858c gene product might be capable of kmtb transamination. it should be stressed that while the recombinant b. subtilis ykrv could transaminate kmtb with glutamine, b. subtilis cell homogenates did not produce met from kmtb when supplemented with glutamine  <cit> . similarly, cell homogenates of m. smegmatis grown in middlebrook 7h <dig> incomplete medium were only able to produce met from kmtb when supplemented with valine, isoleucine, leucine, glutamate, or phenylalanine, as was seen for the recombinant m. tuberculosis bcat in figure  <dig> .

m. tuberculosis was found to contain no putative gene product with significant homology to a daat. in fact, the organism appeared to contain no subfamily iiib aminotransferases. the physiological significance of a lack of a daat is unclear, but many organisms do not contain a homologue of this enzyme. with daat, there might be a diminished capacity to catabolise d-amino acids for energy, although the same reactions could be performed by a d-amino acid oxidase. m. tuberculosis is known to be reliant on carbohydrate catabolism during the active growth phase and lipid metabolism during the chronic, dormant phase  <cit> . therefore, the lack of a daat might be reflective of a lifestyle where protein and peptide catabolism is relatively unimportant.

similarly, m. tuberculosis was found to lack clearly identifiable homologues of several enzymes in the met regeneration pathway. the most glaring omission is the lack of an s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase  homologue . m. tuberculosis contains the preceding enzyme, methionine adenosyltransferase  <cit> , and has an easily identifiable homologue for the succeeding enzyme, spermidine synthase  <cit> . therefore, m. tuberculosis must catalyse samdc activity via another enzyme in order to be able to synthesize polyamines. a previous study has demonstrated samdc activity in m. bovis homogenates, but has not identified the enzyme responsible  <cit> . resolution of this issue is critical for a more complete understanding of polyamine biosynthesis in tuberculosis, and may yield a novel enzyme as an additional drug target. the m. tuberculosis genome also appears to be missing homologues of the enzymes converting methylthioribose to kmtb . however, outside of k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis, these enzymes have not been well studied, and, between these two organisms, there are key differences in the enzymes catalyzing several steps  <cit> . in silico analyses have suggested that pseduomonas aeruginosa, xylella fastidiosa, leptospira interrogans, and thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis have readily identifiable, complete met regeneration pathways  <cit> . however, the presence or absence of the pathway in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms remains to be determined by functional analysis. therefore, there is much left to examine before concluding that m. tuberculosis contains neither homologues nor analogues to these met recycling enzymes. however, even in the absence of a complete met salvage pathway, m. tuberculosis, as an intracellular pathogen, might utilise exogenous kmtb as a met source.

CONCLUSIONS
branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase has been cloned and characterised from m. tuberculosis. this enzyme was found to be responsible for the formation of methionine from ketomethiobutyrate, and could be inhibited in vitro by a series of aminooxy compounds. several of these compounds were found to be effective inhibitors of m. tuberculosis or m. marinum growth in culture, with mic values as low as  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm respectively. these studies demonstrate the importance branched-chain amino acid and methionine metabolism to the survival of mycobacteria, and open up the potential for the development of more potent and less toxic aminooxy inhibitors of the branched-chain aminotransferase.
