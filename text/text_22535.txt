BACKGROUND
gene expression is regulated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional pathways, which are crucial for optimizing gene output and for coordinating cellular programs  <cit> . one of the recently discovered mechanisms in plants was short non-coding rnas mediated gene silencing at post-transcriptional  level  <cit> . short rnas  are diverse and can be categorized into two major classes: short interfering rnas  and micrornas   <cit> . sirnas, processed from perfectly double-stranded rna , posttranscriptionally silence transposons, viruses, and transgenes are important for dna methylation  <cit> . micrornas , a near ubiquitous class of short rnas in plants, are orchestrated by dcl-like family from single-stranded rna precursors that possess imperfect stem-loop foldback structures  <cit> . base pairing is used by mature mirnas to guide riscs to specific mrnas bearing fully or partly complementary sequences  <cit> . repression of the target transcripts by mirnas may occur through translational inhibition or slicing, with the two layers of regulation not necessarily coinciding spatially or temporally  <cit> . based on the sheer abundance and diversity of plant mirnas, it is likely that most, if not all, physiological and biochemical processes in plants involve at some point the action of one or more mirnas  <cit> .

tomato is an emblematic system to study molecular basis of fleshy fruit ripening and senescence, ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction owing to its genetic and molecular tractability  <cit> . recently, involvement of srnas in tomato fruit has been received attention. the homology search and molecular biology methods were used for characterizing novel and conserved mirnas at the outset  <cit> . as deep sequencing technology has emerged and been employed extensively to identify mirnas in model plants such as arabidopsis and rice because of its high throughputs and accuracy, which make explore mirnas in large scale possible  <cit> . the  <dig> pyrosequencing sequencing platform was first used to sequence tomato srnas from young leaves and a young green fruits of microtom  <cit> . several conserved and non-conserved mirnas were identified in this study, and mir <dig> was found to be involved in fruit ripening which raised the possibility that fruit ripening process may be under mirna regulation  <cit> 

tomato fruit ripening and senescence are genetically regulated processes. ripening of fleshy fruits involves evolution of ethylene, accumulation of pigments such as carotene and lycopene, development of aroma and flavor, softening of fruit tissues and increased susceptibility to pathogens  <cit> . to date, functional analysis has been carried out only for a few tomato mirnas, most of which were validated to be involved in leaf and flower development  <cit> , and a few of which were proved to be involved in the stress-response and host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . in order to study the functions of mirnas in tomato fruit ripening and senescence, and their possible roles in ethylene pathway, the next generation sequencing method  was employed to identify mirnas in tomato fruit. bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches were combined to profile the mirnas expression patterns of fruits at three different ripening stages . the influences of exogenous ethylene on the mirnas expression levels were also explored.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing of short rnas of three fruit ripening stages
to explore the possible regulatory roles of mirnas in fleshy fruit ripening process, we select fruits at three different ripening periods  of the solanum lycopersicum . the srna fraction was subject to deep sequencing on the illumina 1g platform which produced  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads, respectively. after removal of the adaptor sequences and filtering by sequence properties,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> redundant srna reads were remained for further analysis, respectively .

two distinguishing features of the small rnas libraries are the populations and distributions. the composition of small rnas often reflects roles of different categories of small rnas in a particular tissue or species or associated biogenetic machines. since most of the small rnas with known functions are 20- <dig> nt long, we only investigated the distribution of small rnas of 18- <dig> nt in the three libraries . in the three ripening stages, the 24-nt size class was the overall most abundant class of srnas , which was consistent with that of arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> , but different from that of wheat, chinese yew and grapevine  <cit> . the higher percentage of 24-nt small rnas in tomato fruit may reflect the complexity of the tomato genome because 24-nt sirnas are known as predominant heterochromatin-associated srnas  <cit> . the 21-24nt srnas exhibited a peak at breaker stage, and showed a sharp reduction at the red ripening stage, suggesting potential roles in ripening process.

identification of known and novel mirnas in tomato fruit
conserved mirnas were found in many plant species and have important functions in plant development and stress response  <cit> . to identify the conserved mirnas in tomato, srna sequences obtained by deep sequencing were compared with the currently known mature plant mirnas in mirbase  <cit> . after blastn searches and further sequence analysis, a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas , belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified and all of which can be consulted in two important database .

in addition to the conserved mirnas, there are known mirnas that are not-conserved, but are found in only one or a few plant species such as arabidopsis or physcomitrella patens  <cit> . ten members belong to  <dig> non-conserved mirnas  were present in our data sets at a low abundance, with the exception of mir <dig> that were represented by a relative high number . all of the non-conserved mirnas were validated by the construction of the small rna cdna library method   <cit> .

mirna
a number of criterions are used for evaluating whether a small rna is a genuine mirna, such as formation of a stable hairpin structure, starting with a 5' uridine, lower minimal free energies  for hairpin structure of its precursors, and detection of mirna*s  <cit> . by using these rules, we identified  <dig> novel mirnas belonging to  <dig> families . except for mirz <dig>  most of the novel mirnas were in low copies. the possible reason is that the encoding genes are not broadly conserved and expressed at much lower levels  <cit> .

prediction of the targets of identified mirnas in tomato fruit
target prediction for mirnas is straightforward because it is assumed that most of them match their targets with almost perfect complementarity  <cit> . the putative target genes for all identified conserved and non-conserved mirnas were searched by using the web-based computer psrna target server  which identifies putative targets regulated at post-transcriptional or translational levels.

most conserved mirna targets that are conserved across several plant species, including arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , grape  <cit> , poplar  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . and most mirna families have multiple target sites, suggesting that these mirnas are functionally divergent. in our study,  <dig> targets of conserved and non-conserved mirnas were predicted . the majority of such targets are various transcriptional factors including sbp , myb , nam , and mads-box  that regulate plant development  <cit>  or phytohormone signal transduction  <cit> . other conserved mirnas targets include f-box protein , atp sulfurylase , pectate lyase , endo- <dig>  4-beta- glucanase , laccase , all of which are involved in regulation of metabolic processes. several targets of the mirnas are ago protein  which regulate their own biosynthesis pathway. in addition, targets of the conserved mirnas include disease resistance proteins  which are related to pathogen resistance  <cit> . furthermore, acs and ein <dig>  which are involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction  <cit> , are putative targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively.

the targets of the novel mirnas identified in our library were predicted, most of which were unknown . mirz <dig> was predicted to be related to disease response, mirz <dig> was predicted to be involved in virus infection response. interestingly, a target of mirz <dig> is beta-galactosidase which is an important enzyme affects fruit softening. another member's target of mirz <dig> family is starch synthase which participates in starch biosynthesis, including transient starch  <cit> .

expression profiles of the mirnas involved in tomato fruit ripening
it has been shown that high throughput sequencing provides an alternative way to gain the genome-wide transcript profiles of mirnas abundance  <cit>  and allows us to determine the abundance of various mirna families and even to distinguish different members of a given family of one organism. to elucidate the potential roles of mirnas in tomato fruit ripening process, we profiled the expression levels of known and novel mirnas. we computed the normalised counts of known mirna sequences, plotted them across the three ripening stages and validated some results by stem-loop rt-pcr .

the abundance of most known mirnas decreased during fruit ripening, and some were found only in the mature green stage . a few known mirnas were expressed at high levels in fruit, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  on the other hand, other mirnas, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were expressed at relatively lower levels and can only be detected in mature green stage, particularly, the expression levels of mir <dig> decreased at the breaker stage and increased at red ripening stage compared with that of the mature green stage which reveals its probable specific roles in fruit ripening or ethylene pathway, as one of the predicted targets is 1-aminocyclopropane -1-carboxylate synthase which is a crucial enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . expression of another mirna, mir <dig>  increased from mature green to breaker stage, then dropped sharply in the red stage. interestingly, targets of mir <dig> include mads-box protein and endo- <dig>  4-beta-glucanase, both of which are involved in fruit ripening and softening process  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> mirnas  predicted to have targets related to fruit ripening and softening and ethylene response were validated .

colorless non-ripening , a member of the squamosa-promoter binding protein  family that was shown to be involved in fruit ripening  <cit> , is targeted by mir <dig>  <cit> . the expression levels of mir <dig> also decreased during fruit ripening . two mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  whose targets are ethylene-insensitive  <dig>  and serine/threonine protein kinase  which are vital regulators in ethylene signal transduction <cit> , reported previously  <cit>  and not shown in our sequencing results, showed reduced expression during fruit ripening . a novel mirna  expression levels were also analyzed which was predicted to relate to fruit softening.

overwhelming the majority of the stem-loop rt-pcr results was in agreement with sequencing results. only two mirnas  were exception which could be detected by stem-loop rt-pcr but were not detected or barely detectable by sequencing. this could be due to cross amplification of other highly homologous small rna members or biases occurred during library generation or sequencing in some samples.

expression profiles of the mirnas responses to exogenous ethylene in tomato fruit
ethylene is a regulator of various physiological and morphological responses, including seedling development, leaf and flower senescence, induction of fruit ripening, floral sex determination, resistance to pathogen infection, and adaptation to stress conditions  <cit> . tomato has proven to be a highly successful model system for fruit development and ripening. and the role of ethylene during fruit ripening has been most thoroughly studied in tomato fruit  <cit> . in order to find out the relationships between ethylene treatment and mirnas expression, exogenous ethylene and 1-methylcycloproene were used to treat the mature green fruits. the expression levels of a number of known and novel mirnas were tested by stem-loop rt-pcr. three mirnas  were down regulated; five mirnas  were up regulated, while one mirna  whose target is ein <dig> was not affected, by exogenous ethylene treatment .

discussions
high-throughput sequencing of short rnas in tomato
high-throughput sequencing has been used to study mirnas at the whole genome level in several model plant species, including arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> . the successful application of high-throughput sequencing technology to systemically identify plant mirnas in recent years has greatly advanced our knowledge on the functions of mirnas in plants.

the composition of small rnas often reflects roles of different kinds of small rnas in a specific tissue or species. several plant species, such as pinus cordata, populus balsamifera and grapevine were shown to contain substantially more 21-nt than 24-nt srnas  <cit> . however, we observed an unusually high level of 24-nt srnas compared with the 21-nt class , as in several other plant mirnas studies  <cit> . the number of 24-nt small rnas was almost three times that of the 21-nt class, such a high percentage of 24-nt small rnas may reflect the complexity of the tomato genome because 24-nt sirnas are known to be involved in heterochromatin modification, especially for genomes with high content of repetitive sequences  <cit> .

plant mir genes are possible to arise from gene duplication events which then evolved by random mutations into short, imperfectly paired hairpins  <cit> . those non-conserved mirnas are believed to be evolutionarily recent and generally represented by single copy mir genes  <cit> . recently, many non-conserved mirnas were reported in several species  <cit> . some of these non-conserved mirnas are not found in other species/families and several non-conserved mirnas are found in different phylogenetic families. we also found nine non-conserved mirnas in our database, although most of them were present at a very low level. however, the low number of sequence reads does not rule out that they could be expressed at a high level in specific cells. few non-conserved mirnas were expressed at a relatively high level, suggesting that they may represent an intermediate status between the deeply conserved and the less conserved mirnas.

new species-specific mirnas are considered to be young mirnas that have evolved recently, and are often expressed at a lower level than conserved mirnas, as was reported for arabidopsis and wheat  <cit> . this observation is true for many new tomato mirnas identified here. however, few new mirnas were expressed at a high level in a tissue-specific manner . in some cases we observed inconsistency between the level of mirnas identified by solexa sequencing and experimental verification. it is possible that during library generation or sequencing some bias could occur for certain sequences in some samples.

in contrast to the  <dig> pyrosequencing sequencing in tomato previously  <cit> , more reads were obtained in each of our three libraries, and mirnas at different fruit ripening stages were additionally analyzed in our study. in our database, most conserved mirnas have been detected, including  <dig> conserved and non-conserved mirna families, which cover all the published mirnas in the two databases for tomato mirnas .

dalmay and colleagues studied the correlation between the short rnas and fleshy fruit development using deep sequencing technology  <cit> . however, mostly srnas were analyzed, which is different from our mirnas study. but they reported several mirnas, and validated one novel mirna related to the glutamate accumulation which contributes to the tomato fruit taste.

targets of known and novel mirnas in tomato fruit
target prediction is necessary for assessing mirnas' putative functions. currently, the most efficient tool available for this is the bioinformatics approach facilitated by the high degree of homology between mirna and its target sequences in plants  <cit> . our analysis reveals that most of the predicted targets in tomato have a conserved function among a variety of plant species  <cit> . consistent with previous reports, the largest of these targets in tomato fruit were plant-specific transcription factors, such as ap <dig>  nac, sbp and the arf family  <cit> . the second largest targets encoded a range of different proteins implicated in a variety of metabolic processes, such as atp sulfurylase, pectate lyase, endo- <dig>  4-beta-glucanase, laccase. in addition, functions of several targets are largely unknown.

although many conserved mirna targets were predicted, only a limited number of mirna targets were identified experimentally  <cit> . several mirnas slice their targets and can be validated by race. alternatively, other mirnas inhibit target gene expression through translational arrest, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which have been shown to regulate their target genes  predominantly by inhibiting their translation  <cit> . indeed, genetic and biochemical evidence is accumulated that plant mirna-guided silencing has a widespread translational inhibitory component  <cit> .

the novel tomato mirnas target different genes with a wide variety of predicted functions. it may be worthy to note that those mirz <dig> targets six members of disease resistance protein , which are likely to be involved in host-pathogen interactions. surprisingly, one target of mirz <dig> is beta-galactosidase which is a crucial enzyme for fruit softening, which is beneficial for clarify the cooperating roles in freshly fruit ripening and senescence. the target of another member in mirz <dig> family is starch synthase which participates in regulating starch biosynthesis   <cit> .

fruit ripening and softening related mirnas
functional analysis has been carried out only for role of a few tomato mirnas morphological development  <cit> . conserved and non-conserved mirnas regulate genes involved in fleshy fruit development were reported previously  <cit> . a target gene of mir <dig> belong to squamosa-promoter binding protein  family called cnr was validated, which plays pivotal roles in fruit ripening  <cit> . over-expression of mir <dig> can cause the fruit red colour slightly lighter than the wild type, which was thought that the expression of mir <dig> and cnr overlaps only partially and the function of the mirna is to suppress cnr expression in specific cell types. cnr mrna is up-regulated in fruit at the breaker stage  <cit> , coincidently, our sequence results showed a negative correlation as expected. two important targets of mir <dig> are endo- <dig>  4-beta-glucanase and mads-box protein, both of which are important regulators in fruit ripening and softening  <cit> . our sequencing results showed that the abundance of mir <dig> peaked at the breaker stage and decreased sharply in red ripening stage suggesting its possible function in fruit ripening. a target of mir <dig> is pectate lyase which is an important enzyme in fruit softening  <cit> . meanwhile, a novel mirna, whose target is beta-galactosidase, which is also a key softening related enzyme  <cit> . the expression levels of the two mirnas were also coinciding with the assumption including the softening ripening stage .

intriguingly, an in-depth study of the tomato transcriptome and proteome unraveled the regulation mechanisms during fruit ripening stages. the transcriptional regulation is mostly responsible for global reductions in plastid gene expression prior to or at the onset of fruit formation whereas post-transcriptional events become predominant at the breaker stage  <cit> . these post-transcriptional events did not lead to significant reductions in mrna levels, although mrna stability was reported to be modestly affected for some genes  <cit> . mirnas and their targets have been shown to regulate in translational inhibition way in a fairly large fraction  <cit> .

ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction related mirnas in tomato
recent researchers have witnessed the great progress in the area of identification of interaction between mirnas pathways and phytohormone responses, which improves our understanding of mechanism of plant development controlled by mirnas and hormone action to a large extent. one of the most important phytohormone is ethylene which plays vital roles during all stages of the plant life cycle, functioning through seed germination to ripening and various abiotic stress conditions  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> were reported to be associated with ethylene in rice  <cit> . most targets of mir <dig> are myb, and a novel target not related to myb in tomato recently  <cit> . another important target of mir <dig> is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase which plays vital roles in ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . as a typical climacteric plant, abundance ethylene was synthesized at the breaker stage approximately, and the expression level of mir <dig> was suppressed which match our results well. mir <dig> and mir <dig> also target f-box family proteins which are important participants in the signal transduction pathways of different plant hormones  <cit> . the stability of the ethylene signaling regulators ein <dig> and ein <dig> are modulated by the f-box proteins etp1/2and f-box proteins ebf1/ <dig> respectively. ethylene insensitive  <dig> , a target of mir <dig>  is the key positive regulator of ethylene signal transduction and other hormones such as abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin and jasmonate and thus may represent a point of crosstalk between multiple hormone signaling pathways  <cit> . ctr <dig> is a negative regulator of ethylene response that likely interacts directly with receptor molecules to form a signaling complex  <cit> . as with the ethylene receptors, all tissues evaluated express ctr <dig> genes and their mrnas are differentially accumulated depending on tissue. lectr <dig> induction is associated with tissues at stages of development associated with increased ethylene, including fruit ripening and is a validated target of mir <dig>  <cit> . exogenous ethylene can influence the mirnas expression patterns, most of which shown negative correlation to their targets well except for mir <dig>  was not affected by exogenous ethylene treatment . the most likely reason was that mir <dig> affected this target slightly and we cannot catch the discrepancy.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used a combination of high throughput sequencing and molecular biology approaches to explore the involvement of mirnas during fruit ripening process. total  <dig> conserved and non-conserved mirna families and  <dig> novel mirna families were indentified. the expression profiles of mirnas at different ripening stages were analyzed and validated simultaneously, most of which were in agreement with the sequencing results. the influences of exogenous ethylene on mirnas expression were also studied. these findings provide valuable information for further functional verification of mirnas in tomato fruit ripening and ethylene response.
