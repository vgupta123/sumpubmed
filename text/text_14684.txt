BACKGROUND
mycoplasma pneumoniae is a cell wall-less bacterium belonging to the mollicutes class, which invades the human host respiratory epithelium by adhering with a tip-like attachment organelle. several proteins, including the major surface adhesins p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and proteins hmw <dig> to hmw <dig>  as well as proteins a, b and c, interact to constitute this tip-like attachment organelle  <cit> . m. pneumoniae causes atypical pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections  such as tracheobronchitis, and is responsible for up to 20% of all cases of community-acquired pneumonia, especially among school-aged children and young adults  <cit> .

m. pneumoniae is intrinsically resistant to beta-lactams antibiotics usually given as the first-line treatment of rtis. macrolides and related antibiotics represent the treatment of choice for m. pneumoniae respiratory infections. therefore, an early and specific diagnosis is necessary to give the patient the correct antibiotic treatment.

serology, including the complement fixation test  and different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays , is the most common laboratory method used for the diagnosis of m. pneumoniae infection although culture methods and pcr are also performed. the cft may have limited value because it also measures antibodies derived from earlier infections and antibodies to m. pneumoniae glycolipid antigens; thus, it can react with antigens of different origins  <cit> . previous studies comparing the cft to the pcr detection of m. pneumoniae, however found good sensitivity and specificity for the cft  <cit> . many elisa-based assays, using protein extracts, membrane preparations, glycolipid extracts or whole cell lysates have been developed for the detection of m. pneumoniae infection  <cit> . in particular, good sensitivity has been observed for assays with p <dig> adhesin-enriched extracts  <cit> . in a study by beersma et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> commercial serologic assays for m. pneumoniae specific immunoglobulins m and g and the cft were evaluated with pcr used as the "gold standard". the igm assay that showed the best sensitivity and specificity were from the ani labsystems  corresponding to p1-enriched extracts. other studies have reported the superiority of assays using the p1-enriched antigen on the basis of a comparison of the strength of the immune response  <cit> . nonetheless in the same studies, high igg seroprevalence has been observed in the control sera ranging from 36%  to 93% . the variability of the elisa results observed in these studies suggests the need for improved sensitivity and specificity among commercialised serological assays used to detect m. pneumoniae infection  <cit> .

recently, many studies have reported great interest in using a recombinant protein corresponding to the c-terminal portion of the p <dig> adhesin, which has been described as the immunodominant antigen in m. pneumoniae  <cit> . antigenic properties of recombinant proteins p <dig> and p <dig> have also been shown  <cit> . a combination of frequently recognized antigens could be useful for diagnostic purposes. thus, the identification of antigenic m. pneumoniae rti-related proteins appears to be a prerequisite for the development of serological test kits based on recombinant antigens.

in this study, we used serologic proteome analysis of m. pneumoniae m <dig> total extracts to simultaneously identify candidate antigens inducing an antibody response  <cit> . we focused on the atp synthase beta subunit  of m. pneumoniae as it was likely to generate an antibody response in m. pneumoniae-infected children and adults at an early stage of infection. the atpd gene  contains an open reading frame of  <dig>  nucleotides and encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  da  <cit> . it was cloned and expressed in e. coli to obtain recombinant protein. we then compared the serological performance of this antigen with a previously described recombinant c-terminal fragment of the p <dig> adhesin   <cit> , using in-house igm, iga and igg elisas and the commercial ani labsystems elisa that uses an adhesin p1-enriched whole extract. we further evaluated the performance of the combination ratpd and rp1-c igm by binary logistic regression analysis to compare results between the recombinant antigens, either alone or together, and the enriched whole extract.

RESULTS
identification of the atpd antigen by serologic proteome analysis
the total protein fraction obtained from the m. pneumoniae m <dig> strain was separated by two dimensional gel electrophoresis   and the staining pattern of the 2d immunoblots was probed with  <dig> different serums samples from patients with rtis  or healthy blood donors . the protein identities of six spots that were detected by at least one of the serum samples from the  <dig> rti patients were determined using maldi-tof mass spectrometry following in-gel tryptic digestion . of the six proteins identified, four  were highly detected by serum samples from patients , but only two proteins, the p <dig> protein and the atp synthase beta subunit, showed no reactivity with serum samples from healthy blood donors .

a antigenic proteins were separated by 2-de, and their identities were determined by peptide mass fingerprinting.

expression, characterization and purification of ratpd and rp1-c proteins
the atpd gene and the c-terminal fragment of p <dig> were amplified by pcr and expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  cells after cloning into the expression vector pdest  <dig>  these proteins were further purified by affinity column and ion exchange chromatography. the expression and purification of the ratpd and rp1-c proteins were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and western blot . two irrelevant purified his-tagged recombinant proteins of the same mass as ratpd  and rp1-c  were included in the analysis. both ratpd and rp1-c were successfully expressed in e. coli  and purified with a purity estimated to be 100% by densitometry . the apparent molecular masses of ratpd and rp1-c were about  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively, in agreement with the theoretical values.

the ratpd and rp1-c proteins were both recognised by pooled m. pneumoniae-positive serum samples , but not by healthy blood donors . the two irrelevant proteins were not recognised by serum samples from either patients or healthy blood donors . these results show that m. pneumoniae-infected patients have circulating anti-atpd and anti-rp <dig> -c antibodies, thereby confirming that these two recombinant proteins are antigenic.

ratpd and rp1-c elisa tests
serum samples from  <dig> patients  with m. pneumoniae rtis and  <dig> healthy blood donors were screened for anti-m. pneumoniae igm, iga and igg antibodies using an in-house elisa with ratpd and rp1-c . we set positive criteria as a value above the cut-off determined by receiver operating characteristics curve  analysis. the cut-off values of the igm, iga and igg elisa tests were determined as an absorbance value of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, for ratpd, and of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively for rp1-c. the ratpd protein demonstrated a higher discriminating score  â‰¤  <dig> ) than rp1-c for all of the ig classes in children and adults . among the  <dig> serum samples from children tested,  <dig>  showed a high igm titre compared with ratpd, whereas  <dig>  were iga-positive and  <dig>  were igg-positive. serum samples from  <dig>  children were positive for igm against the rp1-c protein, whereas  <dig>  and  <dig>  were iga- and igg-positive, respectively . out of the  <dig> serum samples from adults infected with m. pneumoniae,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tested positive for igm antibodies against the ratpd and rp1-c proteins, respectively. of these samples,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reacted with the ratpd and rp1-c proteins, respectively, for the iga class, whereas  <dig>  and  <dig>  were igg-positive for the ratpd and rp1-c proteins, respectively . specificity values ranging from 90% to 97% were found for igm, iga and igg ratpd and rp1-c protein elisas, meaning that no more than 3% to 10% of the serum samples from healthy donors had absorbance values above the cut-off .

serum samples from  <dig>  children and  <dig>  adults were igm-positive based on the ani labsystems elisa. the iga and igg ani labsystems eia assays showed the best sensitivity for serum samples from both children and adult patients, with iga being detected in  <dig>  children and  <dig>  adults and igg being detected in  <dig>  children and  <dig>  adults . it should be noted that although the igm ani labsystems showed good specificity for children and adults , its specificity for iga and igg were much lower, at 56% and 29%, respectively . indeed, 44%  and 71%  of the blood donor serum samples were found to be positive by the iga and igg ani labsystems commercial kits, respectively .

for the three elisa tests, a significant increase in igm, between two- and three-fold, was detected between the first  and second of the six paired serum samples. a two-fold increase in the iga and igg responses was also seen between the first and second samples .

statistical analysis of the ratpd - rp <dig> combination
to evaluate whether a combination of multiple antigens increased the ability to distinguish patients with rtis from healthy donors, we compared the seroreactivity with a single antigen  to a combination of these antigens and to a p1-enriched total extract from the ani labsystems kit .

the auc score increased with the number of recognised antigens, going from  <dig>  for a single recognised antigen to  <dig>  for two recognised antigens for igm class in children and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the igm class in adults. moreover, the auc scores of the combination of the igm class were higher in children and adults than the respective scores seen with the ani labsystems kit .

the ratpd - rp1-c elisa igm combination showed the best sensitivity, detecting  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the serum samples from infected children and adults, respectively, compared with the sensitivity obtained with the recombinant antigens alone or the p1-enriched total extract from the ani labsystems kit . combination of the two antigens primarily improved the igm sensitivity for adult serum samples .

the best sensitivity for the detection of igg and iga in serum samples from children and adults sera was obtained with the ani labsystems elisa using p1-enriched total extract. nonetheless, with regard to specificity, no more than 10%  of the blood donor serum samples were detected positive for iga and igg by the recombinant protein combination, contrasting with the 44%  and 71%  found to be positive for iga- and igg, respectively, with the ani labsystems kit .

cross-reaction studies
we preliminarily evaluated the specificity of the ratpd elisa-based assay for igm, iga and igg with a panel of  <dig> serum samples from patients with non-m. pneumoniae rtis including chlamydia pneumoniae , legionella pneumophila , coxiella burnetii , streptococcus pneumoniae , bordetella pertussis  and chlamydia psittaci . the ratpd elisa assay showed good specificity  for all three antibody classes, with no more than  <dig> of the  <dig> serum samples cross-reacting .

discussion
respiratory disease due to m. pneumoniae can be assessed by serological methods, and of these the cft and elisa are most widely used. the conserved c-terminal region of the p <dig> adhesin  was recently confirmed as the main antigen for the immunodiagnosis of m. pneumoniae infections  <cit> .

this work reports the first immunoproteomic study for m. pneumoniae, leading to the identification of new antigenic proteins such as the atp synthase beta subunit, enolase, the pyruvate dehydrogenase beta subunit  and fructose bisphosphate aldolase. antibodies against the groel protein have previously been reported in serum samples from patients with rtis  <cit> . all of the antigens described in this study, except the enolase protein, were previously described as "proteins of the triton x- <dig> insoluble fraction of m. pneumoniae"  <cit> . these proteins may be associated or bound to a cytoskeleton-like structure, which could provide the necessary framework to maintain and stabilize the shape of m. pneumoniae  <cit> , to allow motility  <cit>  and to allow the formation of an asymmetric cell. the correct assembly of this organelle is a prerequisite for the binding of m. pneumoniae to specific receptors on the host cell  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that the enolase and the pdh-b protein in addition to their major biosynthetic and metabolic roles in the cytoplasm, could be translocated to the surface to serve as plasminogen- and fibronectin-binding proteins, respectively, facilitating interactions between mycoplamas and the extracellular matrix  <cit> . thus, these data suggest a pivotal role for these proteins in the infection mechanism of m. pneumoniae.

serologic proteome analysis showed that the atpd and the p <dig> proteins were highly detected by serum samples from patients with rtis and not from healthy blood donors. the other proteins identified were less able to discriminate between patients and controls as they were lightly antigenic to blood donors . thus the atpd and the rp1-c proteins were selected for further serological study focusing on comparisons of the performance of assays using these recombinant proteins with assays using adhesin p1-enriched total extracts such as the commercial ani labsystems kit.

to this end, the atpd gene and the p1-c sequence were cloned, expressed in e. coli, and purified. the serological performance of the two recombinant proteins either alone or in combination , and of the ani labsystems kit were further compared using a panel of  <dig> serum samples from m. pneumoniae-infected patients  and  <dig> serum samples from healthy blood donors. the ratpd protein-based assay, either alone or in combination with rp1-c, identified more patient serum samples  than the ani labsystems test for igm, but fewer than the ani labsystems eia tests for iga and igg. in particular, 80% of the serum samples from infected adult were found to be igm-positive by the combination of the two antigens compared with 70%, 44% and 48% by ratpd alone, rp1-c alone and the ani labsystems assay, respectively . previous studies have shown that young people tend to have higher level of igm antibodies in acute infections, while adults may lack igm during this phase  <cit> . in recent studies, however, most of the igm assays tested showed inaccurate sensitivity ranging from  <dig> to 80%  <cit> . thus the good sensitivity of the ratpd - rp1-c combination, especially in adults, seems promising and could be suitable for a rapid igm assay  <cit> .

when studying responses of healthy blood donors, the ratpd or rp1-c or ratpd-rp1-c based assay detected a few sera positive for igm, iga and igg. in contrast, a high number was detected positive with the iga and igg-eia ani labsystems assays. such a high igg seroprevalence in the control serum samples has been observed in previous studies with the same kit  <cit> , suggesting the possibility of false-positive results for that assay. the evaluation of the performance of igg assays, however, is complicated by the lack of information on previous m. pneumoniae infections for the control serum samples. as described in a previous study of the prevalence of m. pneumoniae igg and iga antibodies in a healthy population  <cit> , the seroprevalence increases with age but doesn't exceed 58% for igg or 28% for iga, even among the ederly. the elevated levels of specific m. pneumoniae igg antibodies may be caused by past m. pneumoniae infections  <cit> . in addition, a variety of non specific antibodies may develop in association with m. pneumoniae infection due to the sequence homology of adhesin proteins and glycolipids of the m. pneumoniae cell membrane with mammalian tissues  <cit> .

the iga and igg assays using recombinant proteins  may lack sensitivity compared to the results obtained with the commercial assay. nonetheless, the use of recombinant proteins may be more specific than the whole extract used in the ani labsystems assays, avoiding the detection of cross-reactive antibodies to m. pneumoniae. many studies have reported the advantage of using a purified recombinant protein in serodiagnosis arguing that better defined antigen preparations should give more accurate results and should be more specific than the use of a glycolipid or whole-cell antigen  <cit> .

preliminary cross-reactivity studies were performed to assess the specificity of the ratpd elisa assay and showed weak cross-reactivity with other organisms involved in respiratory disease, including s. pneumoniae, c. pneumoniae and c. psittaci, l. pneumophila, b. pertussis and c. burnetii. three serum samples from c. pneumoniae-infected patients and two serums samples from s. pneumoniae-infected patients were detected by the ratpd assay. this could have been due to antigenically similar epitopes, but we could not exclude the possibility of co-infection as these serum samples were found to be positive by the rp1-c assay, as well . these data suggest a low risk of cross-reactivity of this assay with an immune response to other respiratory tract bacterial infections, but more rti serum samples should be tested to confirm these results. the false-positive results could be also explained by cross-reactivity between the ratpd proteins of m. pneumoniae and m. genitalium, a phylogenetically closely related species to m. pneumoniae. however, we were not able to collect and study some serum samples from m. genitalium-infected patients as the diagnosis of these infections is only based on molecular methods. it would be very interesting to further include some serum samples from m. genitalium-infected patient in the study.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study presents a new antigen, atpd, that could contribute to improvements in the diagnosis of m. pneumoniae infection in the early and acute phase and could be more specific than the commercial assays using complex extracts. we have shown that the combination of ratpd with rp1-c antigen to detect igm contributed to improvements in the early specific diagnosis of m. pneumoniae infection. indeed, several studies have recently reported that combination of selected antigens provide higher sensitivity than single antigens  <cit> .
