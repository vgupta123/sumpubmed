BACKGROUND
nitrogen  is an essential macronutrient and a key factor controlling plant growth and development. nitrate is the main form of n available in agricultural soils  <cit> . nitrate is taken up by the cell by specific nitrate transporters and is reduced to nitrite in the cytoplasm by nitrate reductase. nitrite is reduced to ammonium in the plastid by nitrite reductase and is incorporated into amino acids by the glutamate synthase/glutamine synthetase cycle . nitrate metabolism is tightly coordinated with carbon metabolism, since carbon skeletons in the form of 2-oxoglutarate are required for ammonium assimilation  <cit> . one of the most striking examples of plant plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions is root system architecture modulation by changes in nitrate availability . in order to identify molecular mechanisms underlying these changes, transcriptomics analyses of the nitrate response of arabidopsis have been performed, most of them utilizing the affymetrix ath <dig> genechip. analyses with the ath <dig> chip showed that nitrate is able to regulate more than  <dig>  genes in roots, some of them responding as fast as 3–6 minutes after nitrate exposure  <cit>  and including genes involved in nitrate transport, reduction and assimilation, hormone signaling pathways, transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases, among others  <cit> . however, a detailed view of the transcriptomics changes triggered by nitrate has been limited by the representation of genes in the ath <dig> microarray. ath <dig> contains probe sets representing approximately  <dig>  genes allowing for the detection of only 71% of the genes annotated in the arabidopsis genome v. <dig>  moreover, these probes do not include important regulatory elements of the genome such as small .

high-throughput sequencing technologies allow for quantitative determination of rna levels and rna sequencing  is becoming the technology of choice to investigate the transcriptome. rna-seq offers several advantages over hybridization-based techniques like microarrays  <cit> . rna-seq is not limited to detection of transcripts that correspond to annotated genes, thus it allows for identification of new genes. rna sequencing can also be utilized to analyze the srna component of the transcriptome when libraries are prepared from low-molecular weight rna fractions  <cit> . micrornas , short interfering rnas  and other types of srnas have been shown to play important roles in a broad range of biological processes, such as plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> , including plant responses to various nutrients  <cit> .

in plants, the srna transcriptome is primarily composed of 23– <dig> nt sirnas and 21– <dig> nt mirnas  <cit> . since mirna precursors have distinctive secondary structures, many bioinformatics programs have been developed to predict new mirnas based on sequencing of a srna in a library and inspection of the genome sequence containing this sequence for putative mirna precursors  <cit> . combination of deep sequencing approaches and bioinformatics predictions have identified  <dig>  mirnas related sequences across different phyla out of which  <dig> correspond to arabidopsis mirnas in mirbase v. <dig>  <cit> .

mirna regulation of nitrate-responsive genes has been shown to be a key mechanism of plant responses coordinating nitrate availability and root developmental responses. mir <dig> is down-regulated by nitrate treatments in pericycle cells and this leads to an induction of its target, the auxin response factor arf <dig>  <cit> . regulation of arf <dig> by mir <dig> causes a change in the ratio of initiating and emerging lateral roots in response to nitrate  <cit> . another nitrate regulatory module, consisting of mir <dig> and the afb <dig> auxin receptor has been shown to control root system architecture in response to external and internal nitrate availability  <cit> . microarray analysis suggests that other mirnas can be involved in root responses to nitrate, since several mirna targets are regulated by nitrate  <cit> .

in this paper, we used illumina sequencing technology to characterize the poly-a + and srna component of nitrate- and control-treated arabidopsis roots to identify new nitrate-responsive genes. using bioinformatics analysis of our libraries and mirna prediction algorithms we were able to find new root expressed genes including new mrnas and mirnas. we discovered a new mirna/target module that might act as an integrator of n and carbon metabolism in arabidopsis roots.

RESULTS
deep sequence analysis of the root transcriptome
in order to determine poly-a + and srna expression of arabidopsis roots and their changes in response to nitrate, we grew plants in hydroponic nitrate-free medium with  <dig>  mm ammonium succinate as the only n-source for two weeks and treated them with 5 mm kno <dig>  or 5 mm kcl as control, for 2 hours. these experimental conditions have been previously shown to elicit robust gene expression responses to nitrate  <cit> . total rna from two independent sets of plants  was extracted from roots, and poly-a + enriched and srna fractions were used to construct libraries for illumina sequencing . the sequencing yielded ~ <dig> to  <dig> million 35 bp long  or 50 bp long  raw reads per sample library. after quality control filtering and trimming adaptor sequences , the reads were mapped to the arabidopsis thaliana genome using the arabidopsis genome annotation available at the arabidopsis information resource  v. <dig> . approximately two thirds of the total illumina reads perfectly matched the genome and were used for further analysis .

analysis of the size distribution of sequences in the srna libraries showed that  <dig> nt long rna molecules were the most abundant followed by  <dig> nt long sequences . the pattern of srna sizes reflects a typical population of srnas with abundant mirnas and tasirna  and sirnas  . however, we did not find accumulation of trna fragments as described in roots of phosphate-starved plants  <cit>  or nitrate-starved seedlings  <cit> . we did not observe any obvious effect of nitrate provision on rna size distribution , suggesting that nitrate treatments under our experimental conditions do not have a global effect on srna population structure. next, valid sequences were classified according to the genomic regions they match. most srna sequences matched intergenic regions , followed by mirna  and rrna genes  . we were able to detect  <dig> distinct mature arabidopsis mirna sequences, corresponding to  <dig> different mirna families, according to the mirbase database v. <dig>  . the number of mirna sequences identified represents  <dig> % of the  <dig> mirnas reported in mirbase v. <dig>  indicating that a considerable proportion of known mirnas are expressed in the root organ. this number greatly exceeds the previously reported number of mirnas expressed in roots, that indicated expressed mirnas are less than 40% of the annotated total mirnas  <cit> . we were also able to identify sequences corresponding to trans-acting sirnas , including ta-sirnas arising from the tas <dig>  tas <dig> and tas <dig> genes . it has recently been shown that a significant number of mirnas have specific root developmental zone or root cell type expression profiles  <cit> . most root mirnas showed low expression levels under our experimental conditions , suggesting developmental control or expression in specific cell-types of the arabidopsis root.

for illumina libraries made from poly-a + rna, a considerable amount of sequences map to intergenic regions  . inspection of sequences matching intergenic regions showed that most of them arise from telomeric or centromeric regions. transcription from intergenic zones has been reported in previous high-throughput sequencing and tiling array experiments  <cit> . when we considered sequences with a unique match to the genome, only  <dig>  sequences  mapped to intergenic regions . a high proportion of these sequences is supported by arabidopsis ests or cdnas  obtained from tair.

as shown in additional file  <dig>  most of these sequences are located near the 5’ or 3’ of annotated genes. we found sequences matching intergenic regions from poly-a + enriched libraries matching the same strand as annotated genes . interestingly, we also found sequences near annotated genes in antisense orientation . these could represent novel transcripts that could have a role in controlling the expression of corresponding genes.

reads matching protein coding genes  represent ~60% of the unique reads in poly-a + libraries . the number of expressed protein coding genes detected unambiguously  represents 73% of the total annotated in the arabidopsis genome. similar to srnas, a considerable proportion of genes are expressed in a cell-specific manner  <cit> , thus some of the low-expressed transcripts detected under our experimental conditions might be developmentally controlled and/or expressed in specific cell-types of the root.

to date, most transcriptomics studies on the root nitrate response have been performed using the affymetrix ath <dig> genechip  <cit> . in order to determine how our sequencing data compares with data obtained with the affymetrix ath <dig> genechip, we used the same rna samples for illumina library preparation and ath <dig> microarray hybridization. we used the affy package library from bioconductor  to determine the number of present calls in the ath <dig> microarrays as a measure of gene detection. we were able to find  <dig>  probes with a present call, approximately 67% of the gene specific probes that are present in the ath <dig> microarray . the illumina sequencing data detected  <dig>  of these genes  and  <dig>  annotated elements that were called absent in the ath <dig> array. we found that these  <dig>  elements had low expression values when compared with the  <dig>  illumina-detected elements that had present calls in affymetrix . additionally, illumina was able to detect  <dig>  elements that had no probe on the ath <dig> microarray .

in order to determine how data on nitrate-responsive genes obtained with rna-seq and affymetrix ath <dig> chips correlated, we calculated the correlation between the kno3/kcl ratio for rma normalized affymetrix gene expression and the kno3/kcl ratio obtained for normalized libraries at different average gene coverages . we defined agc as the number of reads matching a gene multiplied by read length and divided by gene length. we found correlation between kno3/kcl ratios increase hyperbolically as average gene coverage increases . this indicates correlation between the two techniques depends on gene expression levels. we found excellent correlation  between rna-seq and ath <dig> arrays when gene coverage was  <dig>  or higher  . these results highlight the potential of the sequencing strategy to identify novel nitrate-responsive genes in arabidopsis roots.

deep sequencing reveals a new nitrate-responsive component of the arabidopsis root transcriptome
in order to identify known mirnas that are n-regulated under our experimental n-treatment conditions, we used the deseq package in r to analyze digital gene expression in the rna-sequencing data  <cit> . replicates were used independently for statistical analysis of gene expression. surprisingly, we were not able to identify known mirnas  regulated by nitrate in roots based on our rna-sequencing data. in order to distinguish between a technical and biological explanation for this result, we calculated an rna rarefaction curve considering increasing number of random sequences from our srna libraries and the number of different sequences that could be determined from each sample . we found that even when considering the total number of sequences available in our experiments, almost  <dig> million reads, we were far from saturation. this analysis indicates that most molecules in our srna libraries were sequenced only a few times, making it difficult to obtain accurate quantitative results. using the same rna samples and quantitative real time pcr, we were able to corroborate induction of mir <dig> , a mirna previously identified as nitrate responsive  <cit> . this result indicates that a significantly higher depth of sequencing than the current standards  <cit>  is required for quantitative comparison of the srna fraction of the arabidopsis transcriptome. in contrast, when quantifying mrnas a considerably lower number of sequences is required to reach saturation .

among the poly-a + sequences, we found  <dig> regulated genes, considering only sense sequences that have a unique match to known genes. from these genes,  <dig> were induced and  <dig> were repressed by the nitrate treatment . regulated genes had an overrepresentation of genes belonging to the “nitrate response”, “nitrate transport”, “nitrate metabolic process”, “nitrate assimilation”, “nitrogen cycle metabolic process” and “cellular nitrogen compound biosynthetic process” gene ontology annotation, indicating that rna-seq was successful for identifying nitrate responsive genes. among these nitrate-regulated genes, we found  <dig> protein coding genes without probes in the ath <dig> genechip . we selected eight genes and validated them using real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  . among the new nitrate-responsive genes, we found transcription factors and components of signaling cascades such as a γ subunit of the heterotrimeric g protein, agg <dig>  these genes may represent novel targets in the nitrate regulatory pathways in plants.

reads were mapped to the arabidopsis genome and regulated genes were determined using deseq. we identified protein coding genes that were not represented on the affymetrix ath <dig> microarray. we show the log <dig> value for  <dig> biological replicates.

prediction of new genes
in order to identify regions of the arabidopsis genome that could encode new genes expressed under our experimental nitrate-treatment conditions, we searched for clusters of sequences that match the genome uniquely in regions without annotation . these clusters could overlap annotated genes but in anti-sense orientation. average exon length in the arabidopsis genome  is  <dig> nt, therefore we only considered clusters of  <dig> nt or more. we found  <dig> clusters with these criteria ,  <dig> of which were located in the complementary strand of annotated genes and might represent natural antisense transcripts . two clusters have been previously reported as cis-nats in an analysis of arabidopsis full-length cdnas, at5g <dig> and at3g <dig>  <cit> . we found that one of the  <dig> clusters was induced by nitrate treatments. we labeled this cluster tcp23as as it is antisense to the tcp transcription factor tcp <dig>  . we also found srnas matching the same region both in sense and antisense orientation , however we did not find a correlation between their expression and tcp23as regulation by nitrate, suggesting these sequences most likely represent degradation products of tcp <dig> and tcp23as. tcp <dig> was found not to be regulated by nitrate in our rna-sequencing data . in order to validate expression of this putative antisense transcript, we reverse-transcribed root rna using strand-specific primers for tcp <dig> and for its antisense transcript and performed pcr with gene specific primers. as shown in figure 3c, both tcp <dig> and tcp23as are expressed in roots, but only tcp23as is induced by the nitrate treatment. our data suggest tcp23as could represent a novel nitrate-regulated transcript that might regulate tcp <dig> expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. given the low expression levels of tcp <dig> in whole root sample, it is likely that its regulation by tcp23as occurs only in a subset of root cells.

prediction of novel mirna genes
numerous approaches have been utilized to predict and discover mirnas  <cit> . however, few experiments have been performed under contrasting n nutrient conditions  <cit> . to generate a list of putative new mirnas that may be expressed under our experimental conditions, we used the mirna gene prediction tool available in the university of east anglia  srna toolkit, mircat   <cit> . we chose this prediction tool because it is optimized for the identification of plant mirna hairpins, and it has been trained and tested with published arabidopsis thaliana high-throughput srna sequence data. we used as input for mircat the filtered srna sequences obtained from our  <dig> srna libraries. mircat was able to predict  <dig> mature mirna sequences corresponding to 87% of the known mirnas identified in our samples, indicating that the prediction algorithms implemented in mircat are highly efficient in identifying plant mirnas. the mircat program was able to predict  <dig> new mirna sequences when compared with mirbase v <dig> . from these  <dig> new mirna sequences our studies uncovered,  <dig> were recently cross-validated by other groups, suggesting the veracity of our results  <cit> .  <dig> putative new mirna sequences were found in intergenic regions, likely representing new transcriptional units .  <dig> mirna sequences were found inside introns and  <dig> were found in the 5’utr of protein coding genes suggesting they are transcribed along with the gene they overlap and  <dig> mirna was found in a pseudogene .  <dig> new mirna sequences were located inside the region coding for the stem loop of known mirnas . sequences that map onto mirna precursors and that do not correspond to the mature mirna or mirna* sequences have been previously reported in arabidopsis and are potentially functional mirnas that are generated by the mirna pathway  <cit> . all these new mirnas have low expression levels, most of them being sequenced less than  <dig> times in our libraries, which probably explains why they have not been reported previously.

sequences from the illumina libraries were queried for sequences representing putative new mirnas with the mircat program from the uea srna toolkit. we show the genomic location and sequences of these mirnas. presence of reads corresponding to mirna* are indicated . mirnas that are not included in mirbase  <dig> but that have been cross-validated by other groups are indicated.

the name of mature sequences derived from the same arm of known hairpin precursor were named with the suffix . <dig> or . <dig>  if the sequences derive from the opposite arm from the previously annotated sequence,were named with the suffix -5p, -3p.

a novel nitrate-responsive mirna/target regulatory module 
in order to further characterize the role of the novel mirnas in the root nitrate response, we predicted target genes for new mirnas sequenced in our libraries using the target prediction tool target finder from the uea srna toolkit, . the program is based on a set of rules determined specifically for plant mirna/target interactions  <cit> . we looked in the target list for genes that could be related to n metabolism or to root growth regulation and that were either induced or repressed by nitrate based on our illumina results. one of the predicted targets was the transcript for phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase  <dig>  , an enzyme that catalyzes co <dig> incorporation with phosphoenol pyruvate to form oxaloacetate  <cit> . atppc <dig> is induced in roots after nitrate treatment based on our sequencing data . the mirna predicted to target atppc <dig> has recently been reported as mir <dig>  <cit> . mir <dig> has been shown to be expressed in arabidopsis primary root in the apical half of the meristematic zone , the elongation zone, and the maturation zone, according to sequencing data, but no additional validation on its expression or additional characterization of its function or target prediction has been performed  <cit> . in order to validate mir <dig> as a bona fide mirna, we confirmed its expression and expression of its precursor in roots using rt-qpcr. in addition, mir <dig> precursor accumulated in the dcl <dig>  mutant plants , indicating that mir <dig> precursor is processed by dcl <dig> as most mirna precursors  <cit> . in order to experimentally confirm that atppc <dig> is a mir <dig> target and to map the mir <dig> cleavage site, we performed a modified rlm-race procedure  <cit> . we were able to detect and clone an amplification product corresponding to the expected size of a mir5640-cleaved atppc <dig> fragment. it has been described that cleavage of the target transcripts occurs near the middle of the base-pairing interaction  <cit> . as shown in figure 4b,  <dig> out of  <dig> clones sequenced had a cleavage site inside the mirna complementary sequence, between the 8th and 9th complementary bases from the mirna 5’ end. this result suggests that atppc <dig> is a target of mir <dig> and further corroborates mir <dig> as a bona fide mirna. based on our sequencing data, we did not find differential expression of mir <dig> 2 hours after nitrate treatment, although atppc <dig> is induced by this treatment. in order to determine if mir5640/atppc <dig> could represent a nitrate-responsive mirna/target module, we analyzed the nitrate response of the mir5640/atppc <dig> pair on a time course using rt-qpcr. as shown in figure 4c, atppc <dig> peak of induction by nitrate correlates with mir <dig> repression by nitrate. the reduction of atppc <dig> levels over time also correlates with the de-repression of mir <dig>  suggesting that atppc <dig> levels are post-transcriptionally regulated by this mirna in response to nitrate. thus, mir5640/atppc <dig> represents a nitrate-responsive module that could be important for modulating carbon/n balance for nitrate assimilation in arabidopsis roots.

discussion
high throughput sequencing approaches have become powerful tools to identify the transcriptome of arabidopsis and other systems. besides the ability to profile novel genes expressed at low levels which could not be identified by traditional cloning and sequencing approaches, the high depth of sequencing obtained by these techniques allows for the absolute quantification of genes, and the comparison of gene expression under different experimental conditions  <cit> . our high throughput sequencing results provided a detailed view of poly-a + rnas and srnas expressed in arabidopsis roots. we found that roots express a considerable portion of known protein coding genes and mirna genes. however, most of these genes are expressed at low levels. these transcripts might represent cell specific transcripts whose expression is diluted when considering the whole root. transcriptomics analysis of specific root cell types has shown that gene expression has an important cell-specific component that gives rise to functional diversification of cells  <cit> .

even though the sequencing depth used to characterize the srna component did not allow for accurate quantitative estimates, we were able to discover novel mirnas that have eluded previous efforts. our bioinformatics analysis predicted  <dig> putative mirnas expressed in roots under the experimental conditions. most of these sequences were poorly expressed with less than  <dig> transcript per million transcripts. a recent publication that analyzes mirna expressed in specific developmental zones and cell types of the root shows that  <dig> of these new mirnas have cell or developmental zone specific expression  <cit>  which can explain their low expression in the whole root samples. we were able to validate one of the predicted mirnas, mir <dig>  as a putative mirna expressed in roots. this mirna is located inside intron  <dig> of the callose synthase  <dig> gene . intronic mirnas represent the majority of the mirnas of animal systems but there are only a few examples in arabidopsis  <cit> . characterized intronic arabidopsis mirnas include mir162a and mir <dig> which are involved in the regulation of dcl <dig> <cit> . however, analyzing our sequencing results, we found that the cals <dig> transcript was not regulated by nitrate, thus mir <dig> could have an independent nitrate-responsive promoter or pri-mir <dig> processing to generate the mature mirna could be a nitrate-regulated process.

we found mir <dig> targeted the transcript that codes for atppc <dig>  one of the four phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzymes in arabidopsis  <cit> . atppcs are important enzymes of carbon metabolism that catalyze the β-carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to yield oxaloacetate. in c <dig> plants and algae, it has been shown that atppcs are important for the production of carbon skeletons for nitrogen assimilation  <cit> . although there has been an extensive biochemical characterization of the atppcs enzymes in arabidopsis, there are no reports of their function in n metabolism. atppc <dig> is a root specific atppc  <cit>  and we found that it was nitrate-induced in our experiments, which is in agreement with the positive effect on nitrate assimilation predicted for this atppc. we also found evidence indicating that nitrate induction of atppc <dig> might depend on a mir5640-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of atppc <dig> levels in response to nitrate. although we found atppc <dig> cleavage products that might be generated by mir <dig> action over this transcript, we need further experiments to validate atppc <dig> as a mir <dig> target , and to validate the role of this mirna/target module in nitrate assimilation in roots.

an advantage of using high throughput sequencing is the ability to interrogate gene expression without the representation bias present in microarray experiments. we discovered  <dig> protein-coding genes that have not been reported to be nitrate-responsive in previous transcriptomics analysis of arabidopsis roots. among them, we found highly responsive genes such as bt <dig> , a calmodulin-binding scaffold protein that acts redundantly with other bt proteins in female gametophyte development  <cit> . the closest homolog of bt <dig>  bt <dig>  has been reported to be responsive to multiple hormonal, stress and nutritional signals, including nitrate  <cit> . interestingly, bt <dig> is only expressed when nitrate is supplied, suggesting that it might have a nitrate-specific function in roots. the agg <dig> gene, one of the two genes encoding the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric g protein was also induced by nitrate. heterotrimeric g protein in arabidopsis has been involved in various developmental processes. in roots, it is involved in lateral root formation  <cit>  and root apical meristem growth  <cit> . we have found that nitrate has an effect in primary and lateral root growth  <cit> , thus nitrate regulation of agg <dig> might contribute to this response.

nats are transcripts that fully or partially overlap with other transcripts. these pairs can mediate production of sirnas to silence gene expression  <cit> . additionally, nats can modulate transcription, can affect mrna stability and translation and can induce chromatin and dna epigenetic changes  <cit> . computational predictions have shown that the arabidopsis genome potentially encodes sense-antisense transcript pairs representing approximately 7% of the protein coding genes  <cit> . we were able to identify  <dig> putative nats of >300 bp in our sequencing data. one of these nats was antisense to tcp <dig> gene and was induced by nitrate. tcp genes are transcription factors that promote growth and proliferation  <cit> . tcp <dig> is predicted to contain a chloroplast-targeting peptide, suggesting it might control transcription of chloroplast genes  <cit> . although tcp <dig> has no described function, other class i tcp factors have been shown to be expressed in meristematic tissues and to control cell cycle genes such as pcna and cycb1; <dig> <cit> . thus, tcp23as induction by nitrate might repress tcp <dig> expression, controlling meristematic activity of the primary root. however, further studies are needed to analyze tcp23as role over tcp <dig> expression on roots and on tcp <dig> regulation by nitrate.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the sequencing of small rnas and mrnas uncovered new genes, and enabled us to develop new hypotheses for nitrate regulation and coordination of carbon and n metabolism. a highlight is the discovery of a novel microrna, mir <dig> and its target, atppc <dig>  the data suggest that the nitrate-responsive mirna/target module might be involved in controlling carbon flux to assimilate nitrate into amino acids. these findings suggest that micrornas can have metabolic regulatory functions, as well as previously described developmental functions  <cit>  in the nitrate response of arabidopsis roots.
