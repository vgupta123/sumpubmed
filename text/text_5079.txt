BACKGROUND
the ubiquity of microsatellite or simple sequence repeats  in eukaryotic genomes and their usefulness as genetic markers has been well established over the last decade. microsatellites are mainly characterized by high frequency, co-dominance, multi-allelic nature, reproducibility, extensive genome coverage and ease of detection by polymerase chain reaction with unique primer pairs that flank the repeat motif  <cit> . as a result of these characteristics, microsatellites have become the most favoured genetic markers for plant breeding and genetics applications such as, assessment of genetic diversity, constructing framework genetic maps, mapping of useful genes, marker aided selection and comparative mapping studies  <cit> .

in general, ssrs are identified from either genomic dna or cdna sequences. the standard method for development of ssr markers involves the creation of small insert genomic dna libraries, followed by a subsequent dna hybridization selection by probing them either with radioactively labeled probes or trapping them with biotinylated ssr motifs, and clone sequencing  <cit> . these processes are time consuming, and labour intensive. furthermore, ssrs acquired by these methods are limited with probed ssr motifs , and hence the advantages are partially offset. availability and continuous enrichment of expressed sequence tags  database  in most of the crop species can serve as an alternative strategy for identification and development of microsatellite markers. ssrs can be directly sourced from such databases, thereby reducing time and cost for microsatellite development. however, non-availability of sufficient sequence information  and redundancy that yield multiple set of markers at the same locus are among the major drawbacks of est derived microsatellite markers. more recently unique gene sequences  have been developed via clustering of overlapping est sequences, which overcomes the problem of redundancy in est database and detect variation in the functional genome with unique identity and position  <cit> . parida et al.  <cit>  identified and characterized microsatellite motifs in the unigenes available in five cereal crops  and arabidopsis. these unigene derived microsatellite  markers are expected to possess high inter specific transferability as they belong to relatively conserved regions of the genome.

tea is the oldest, widely consumed and least expensive natural beverage grown mostly in the tropical countries of asia , africa  and to some extent latin america . three camellia species namely c. sinensis l. , c. assamica  and c. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx , traditionally referred as china, assam and cambod varieties, respectively are the important source of foreign exchange for almost all the tea producing countries in the world, including india. the complex life cycle and out breeding nature of tea poses several limitations for its genetic improvement through conventional breeding. the discrimination between true archetypal china, assam and cambod varieties is difficult due to heterogeneous nature of tea  <cit> . furthermore, morphological characteristics are unable to reflect the inherent genetic variation within the crop, which actually shows high plasticity with respect to biochemical and physiochemical descriptors  <cit> . therefore, identification of highly reliable molecular tools such as microsatellite or ssr markers is extremely important to reveal the unexplored genetic variation in tea. despite the obvious advantages of microsatellite markers in terms of inferring allelic variation, estimating gene flow and development of genetic linkage maps  <cit> , only a few microsatellite makers have been reported in tea  <cit> . over the past few years, various est projects and studies  <cit>  have generated publicly available est sequence data in tea. these ests were mostly derived from different organs/tissues such as, young & mature leaves and tender shoots under natural environmental conditions. considering the multiple applications of such data in gene discovery and comparative genomics, publicly available est sequence data  in c. sinensis was mined in the present study for ssr identification via clustering random ests into unigenes/contigs. these unigenes were also searched for abundance, repeat motif types and pattern of distribution of ssrs in the non-redundant  expressed genome of tea. functional analysis of unigenes containing ssrs was done through gene ontology  annotations with the arabidopsis information resource .

we report the development of ugms primer pairs flanking these microsatellite motifs additional to those reported by zhao et al.  <cit> . the ugms markers developed were also tested for cross species transferability to different camellia species. locus orthology was monitored by analyzing the amplification patterns and by sequencing selected amplicons. polymorphisms detected within the accessions of one species and between a set of camellia species was also analyzed to assess as to whether these markers could be useful for diversity studies and also for distinguishing the camellia species.

RESULTS
ests/unigenes data set
a total  <dig>   unigenes were predicted from  <dig>  publicly available est database in c. sinensis by clustering of  <dig> –  <dig> random est sequences. non-redundant  sequence data set represented ~ <dig>  kb expressed genome of tea .

abundance and distribution of ssrs
all  <dig>  potential unigenes were searched for the presence of microsatellites. a total of  <dig>  unigenes containing  <dig> ssrs with motif length ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp were identified . one sequence contained three ssrs and three sequences contained two ssrs each. six ssrs were of compound types . of these, four compound ssrs were uninterrupted, while remaining two were interrupted by the presence of ≤  <dig> arbitrary nucleotides. one ssr was detected for every  <dig>  kb of the est sequences. further analysis of ssr containing unigene sequence data revealed that majority of them  were perfect repeat and/or class i . however, remaining  <dig> %  were found to be of class ii types .

data analysis of ssr motifs in unigenes revealed  <dig> di repeats ,  <dig> tri repeats ,  <dig> tetra repeats ,  <dig> penta repeats  and  <dig> hexa repeats  . among the di-nucleotide repeats the n.n motifs were most abundant  followed by n.n and n. among the mirosatellites containing tri-repeats, n.n and n.n were the maximum , which was followed by n.n and n.n. abundance of other tri repeat containing ssrs were more or less in the similar range. frequency of tetra, penta and hexa repeat containing ssrs was the least.

ugms primer designation
of the  <dig> nr unigenes containing one or more ssrs,  <dig>  were amenable to design flanking oligonucleotide primer pairs. ninety six ugms primer pairs  flanking to different repeat motifs could be designed. primer pairs flanking di repeats  were the most abundant followed by tri , penta , tetra  and hexa  repeats containing microsatellites. primers could not be designed for the rest eighteen  ssr containing unigenes because of either insufficient flanking sequence  or inability to fulfill the criteria for primer design. five  of the  <dig> unigenes were used to design more than one primer pairs targeting nr ssr loci. thus, a non-redundant set of ugms primers could be designed for  <dig> % of the total unigene sequences in our study.

annotations and functional classification
of the  <dig> unigenes that had successful primer pairs developed and validated,  <dig>  matched to arabidopsis genes with high expectation value . to get a better view of the annotated unigenes, we downloaded gene ontology  annotations  <cit>  from the tair website  <cit>  to classify ssrs containing unigenes into functional categories. relative frequencies of go hits for c. sinensis unigenes were assigned to the functional categories. biological process, cellular components and molecular function as defined for arabidopsis proteome are presented in figure  <dig>  in case of biological processes, the c. sinensis unigenes were assigned to thirteen categories. majority were assigned to the two categories namely "other metabolic processes"  and "other cellular processes" . however, other important categories were "protein metabolism" , "response to stress" , "cell organization and biogenesis" , etc. for the cellular components, the unigenes were assigned in thirteen categories with majority of them representing genes participating in "other intracellular components" , "other cytoplasmic components"  and "other membranes components" . the remaining were assigned to important cellular components of "chloroplast" , "ribosomes" , "mitochondria" , etc. when grouped according to likely molecular functions, the unigenes were assigned to fourteen categories and covered "protein binding" , "other binding domains" , "structural molecular activity" , "various catalytic protein groups"  etc. there was considerable representation of unknown processes or fractions irrespective of the go categories such as "unknown molecular functions" , "unknown biological processes"  and "unknown cellular components" .

in general, the ssrs containing unigene sequences detected in tea were homologous to proteins having distinct molecular functions such as, binding, catalytic, transport, enzyme regulators, and structural activities in different biological processes, and cellular and sub-cellular organization.

marker evaluation and polymorphism detection
ninety six primer pairs designed in this study were used to amplify dna from a panel of  <dig> accessions of cultivated tea and related species. of these,  <dig>  primer pairs produced repeatable and reliable amplifications in at least four accessions of tea, while  <dig>  primer pairs either completely failed or led to weak amplifications and thus were excluded from further analysis. marker evaluation details are given in table  <dig>  pcr products of the expected size were obtained in all the cases except in one ugms primer  that had amplified larger size additional amplicons in some cases. multi-locus amplifications were recorded in case of tugms <dig> and tugms <dig>  over all, amplification success rate was the maximum in case of tugms primer pairs containing tri repeats , followed by di-repeat . the pcr success rate of ugms classes having tetra, penta and hexa repeats were ranged from 50% to 60%. seven polymorphic primer pairs namely tugms <dig>  tugms <dig>  tugms <dig>  tugms <dig>  tugms <dig>  tugms <dig>  tugms <dig> gave amplification in all the tested genotypes irrespective of species  and hence can be utilized as universal markers for molecular analysis in tea. however, these markers need to be validated in a larger panel of camellia species.

sixty one primer pairs amplified  <dig> alleles of which  <dig>  were found to be polymorphic. all the ugms markers identified in the present study remained highly polymorphic . the number of alleles detected in the present case ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig> . the ugms markers namely tugms <dig> and tugms <dig> recorded a maximum of  <dig> and  <dig> alleles, respectively. total number of alleles detected among the accessions belonging to three varietal types i.e. assam, cambod and china were  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig>  respectively. a high level of polymorphism has been observed at the species level. no significant difference was detected in percentage polymorphism of china and assam , however, due to hybrid nature of c. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx, a slightly higher level of polymorphism  was recorded in cambod. the he and ho ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   and  <dig>  to  <dig>  , respectively . all the ugms markers showed a significant departure from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  at p <  <dig>  level. the polymorphism information content  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . there was significant difference in the average pic values was recorded in ugms locus harboring different repeat types. average pic values ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . however, an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  pic values were recorded in tugms primers with di and tri repeats, respectively . of the  <dig> ugms primer pairs with pic values ≥  <dig> ,  <dig>  namely tugms <dig>  tugms <dig>  tugms <dig>  tugms <dig>  tugms <dig> recorded amplification in ≥ <dig> accessions were identified as informative and thus would be useful in future marker assisted studies in tea. further, at least  <dig> primer pairs with pic values ≥  <dig>  were identified, which may also be categorized as informative primers after their validation in a larger panel of tea accessions.

in mutation drift equilibrium, heterozygosity excess/deficiency under different mutation models  generated by bottleneck showed significant excess of heterozygosity in both the models. all the tested loci showed excess heterozygosity in sign test and found to be significant in both standardized and wilcoxen test .



cross-species transferability
to assess the conservation of c. sinensis ugms loci across the camellia species, we tested the cross amplification of  <dig> primer pairs on five species representing ten accessions each of c. assamica and c. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx  and one accession each representing c. lutescens, c. irrawadiensis, c. japonica white flower and c. japonica red flower . except for the annealing temperature , identical pcr conditions were used to assess the extent of transferability to related species. all the  <dig> primers recorded transferability in c. assamica and c. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx showing high degree of locus conservation in the cultivated species. however,  <dig> ugms primers gave reproducible amplification at least in a single related species  and recorded an overall  <dig> % cross transferability rate. marker wise amplification pattern of successful ugms primers is presented in table  <dig>  furthermore, transferability rate was significantly higher in tugms primers containing tri or hexa repeats  followed by the primers with di and penta repeats . least transferability was recorded in primers with tetra repeats. as a whole,  <dig>  ugms primers recorded cross-transferability in all the tested species.

sequence comparison of ssr locus
to validate the conservation of ssrs across the varieties and species, at least one amplicon from different genotypes/species and multiple amplicons from the same genotypes were sequenced. multiple amplicons from single genotype were selected to determine the orthology and paralogy of the sequence. when a locus wise dna sequences data in each case was compared, it showed electromorphic size variation solely attributed either due to expansion/contraction of the ssrs, or due to interruptions in the ssr regions. this was most notable among different alleles where the size differences resulted from either simple or complex variation in ssr motifs. even at the multiple amplicons from the diploid genotypes similar situation was noticed. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the size of the multiple amplicons having n motif and consumed primer sites were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> bp longer in case of genotype upasi- <dig> for marker tugms <dig>  similarly, for the kangra jat genotype amplicon size  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp were obtained for tugms <dig> that amplified tc repeats. similar situation was observed with identical amplicon size, and repeat motifs for allelic amplicons from different genotypes as in case of tugms <dig> and tugms <dig>  respectively. further, in order to confirm dna polymorphism and cross-transferability at the sequence level, selected amplicons from c. lutescens, c. irrawadiensis and c. japonica  were sequenced for three ugms primers namely tugms <dig>  tugms- <dig> and  <dig>  the presence of the target microsatellites were observed in all the cases .

inter and intra specific genetic variations among the tea accessions
in the present study, correlations observed between the genetic similarity  matrixes based on jaccard's and nei and li's coefficients methods was  <dig> . the average gs among the  <dig> accessions of camellia species was 22%. within c. sinensis, gs ranged from 26% between kangra jat and sikkim- <dig> to 59% between teesta valley- <dig> and sikkim- <dig>  within c. assamica gs was ranging from 15% to 71%, where as gs ranged from 26% to 46% in c. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx. the average gs remained almost similar in case of c. assamica  and c. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx , while slightly less among the accessions of c. sinensis . we recorded 37% gs between the two accessions of ornamental types c. japonica with red and white flowers.

cluster analysis
the phenetic analysis of the ugms data by two methods showed distinct groups and subgroups . the cluster analysis with jaccard's similarity matrix corresponded well with the nei and li's matrix. though minor changes were evident within the subclusters of the major varietal types, the relative position of the major clusters remained preserved. the neighbour joining  tree was more precise in differentiating the closely related accessions with high bootstrap values . clustering of thirty four accessions of genus camellia into three major groups was strongly supported by high bootstrap values . however, accession of c. lutescens remained isolated as a single solitary genotype with 100% bootstrap value and defined as outgroup. all the china accessions were clustered together in group i. however, two accessions namely upasi  <dig>  and c- <dig>  were also clustered in this group. majority of assam and cambod tea accession clustered together in group ii with bootstrap values of 65%. all but one , tv series accessions representing either assam or cambod also clustered together in group ii. interestingly, two accessions namely upasi  <dig> and upasi  <dig> known for excellent spread and are the source of good quality tea, remained together as intermediates between groups i and ii. accession 124/48/ <dig>  an extreme cambod type with broad-elliptic leaves without distinct marginal veins with pink pigmentation at the petiole base, along with tv- <dig>  clustered as an intermediate group between ornamentals and cultivated tea accessions. as expected, all the three species  clustered separately in the present case.

discussion
abundance and distribution of ssrs and ugms primer development
the present study was designed to utilize the publicly available tea ests for development of reliable ugms markers. we assembled ests into unigenes, consisting of consensus sequences of contigs and the singleton sequences for ssr analysis. the assembly generates longer sequences, which gives a better chance of association of sequences with the proteins. generation of longer sequences can be useful for ssr studies since it can give longer ssr surrounding sequences for primer designing. in addition, the use of nr sequences can give a better estimation of the sequence features in the genome.

in case of tea, we found that  <dig> % unigenes contained nr ssrs. this est-ssr frequency was in the  <dig>  –  <dig> % range obtained for  <dig> dicot species  <cit> . however, it was higher than the  <dig>  –  <dig> % range reported for monocots  <cit> . frequency of est-ssrs in various plant genomes is significantly influenced by the repeat length and the criteria used to search the ssrs in database mining  <cit> . if the repeat length is  <dig> bp, in general 5% of ests have recorded the presence of microsatellites  <cit> . the present study recorded a relatively higher abundance of ssrs as compared to earlier reports in tea  <cit>  and also in other plant species such as grapes  <cit> , sugarcane  <cit> , cereals  <cit>  and coffee ests  <cit> . cardle et al.  <cit>  in a comprehensive computational and experimental characterization of publicly available est sequence database of different plant genomes recorded a significant difference in the type and abundance of ssrs. the average distribution of ssrs estimated to be ranging from  <dig>  kb in rice to  <dig>  kb in soybean,  <dig>  kb in maize,  <dig>  kb in tomato,  <dig>  in arabidopsis,  <dig>  kb in popular and  <dig> kb in cotton. furthermore, occurrence of high frequency of class i  and or perfect repeats in the present case is possibly due to the criteria that had been implemented for mining of ssrs. experimental data originally reported for human  <cit>  and then confirmed in many other organisms including rice  <cit>  had suggested that longer perfect repeats are more polymorphic. the rate of strand slippage has been shown to increase with increasing length of blocks of repeats. therefore, longer perfect repeats are highly variable. however, the lower rate of polymorphism of repeat sequences containing interruptions may be due to the fact that strand slippage of these sequences produces structures with non-complementary bases.

the frequency analysis of various nucleotide repeats in c. sinensis ests revealed that di nucleotide ssrs were the most abundant ssrs followed by tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa repeats. this is in agreement with the frequency trend has been earlier reported in tea  <cit> . in general, microsatellites containing tri-repeats remained most common among the monocots and dicots  <cit> . however, kumpata and mukhopadhyay  <cit>  recorded the abundance of di-repeats in most of the dicots species investigated. high frequency of di-nucleotide repeat has also been reported in case of eucalyptus  <cit>  and citrus  <cit>  ests. high frequency of dinucleotide repeats as observed in the present case could be because ~70% of the overall sequences included in analysis correspond to 5' end of the transcript  <cit> , which included 5' utrs. hence, representation of di nucleotide repeats in this region would not affect the reading frame and thus tolerated more as compared to amino acid coding regions. however, certain frequency of di nucleotide could be abundant in the coding regions such n.n in the present case, which might represent gag, aga, ucu and cuc codon in a mrna population and translate into the amino acids arg, glu, ala and leu, respectively. ala and leu are present in proteins at high frequencies of 8% and 10%, respectively  <cit> . n.n motifs were also the most frequently observed ssrs in different plant species including coffee, cereals and forage crops  <cit>  and also in other perennial crops, such as eucalyptus  <cit> , apple  <cit> , strawberry  <cit>  and citrus  <cit> .

the most abundant tri nucleotide repeats observed in present study were n.n and n.n making up  <dig> % each of total tri-repeats mined, which is the second most abundant motif in arabidopsis  <cit> . further, n.n repeats, which accounted for half of the tri repeats in rice, were rare in dicots  and moderately abundant in monocots other than rice  <cit> , were found to be ~8% of mined tri-nucleotide repeats in present case. parida et al  <cit> , while analyzing the unigenes sequence data of five cereals and arabidopsis observed that monocot and dicots possess common tri repeats. agc/agt/tca/tcc/tcg/tct  coding for serine was the most abundant motifs in arabidopsis, followed by glutamic acid  and leucine . abundance of small/hydrophilic amino acid repeat motifs like that of alanine and serine in the unigenes of cereals and arabidopsis was perhaps because these are tolerated in many proteins, while strong selection pressure possibly eliminates codon repeats encoding hydrophobic/other amino acids  <cit> . this observation suggested that considerable sequence divergence, since their early separation about  <dig> million year ago, between monocot and dicot has led to differential amino acid repeat motifs in the proteins, and that the selection has played a significant role in greater retention of those which are tolerated more.

the overall frequency of nr ugms primer designation was  <dig> % of the unigene sequence data. this figure is significantly higher than that found in the case of grapes and sugarcane  <cit> , where the frequency of non-redundant ssrs in the total population of the clones in the cdna library was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

functional characterization
we characterized a set of unigenes containing successful ugms markers by function. since, the ests utilized here were obtained mostly from leaf and tender shoot tissues under natural environmental conditions hence, functional classification in relation to the organ or physiological conditions is not possible with the available data. however, a considerable frequency  of unigenes containing ugms markers was identified that correspond to the arabidopsis gene sequence data base. these markers were present either in 5' utr  or in the orfs . as observed in earlier studies, majority of the transcripts detected through go annotations represent enzymes of general metabolism  <cit> . however, transcripts related to biological process such as response to abiotic and biotic stresses can be readily mapped using the existing populations. this might reveal functional identity of particular marker locus. since, these markers have recorded allelic variation across selected tea accessions, thereby working with these ugms markers may arguably provide a shortcut to candidate genes and gene based functional markers. one of the approaches for their functional validation could be the establishment of association between trait phenotypes and ugms markers based on these unigenes. in this context, ugms primer pairs designed in tea would be very important assets for understanding functional diversity and also in marker-assisted breeding in this important commercial crop.

marker evaluation and polymorphism detection
only  <dig> % of the designed ugms primer pairs proved to be functional. similar findings were made for sugarcane  <cit> , where 40% of all primer pairs failed to amplify the products. possible explanation for this could be that primers extend across a splice site, the presence of large intron in the genomic sequence, or primers that were derived from chimeric cdna clones. in general, because of conserved nature, limited polymorphism has been detected for est-ssrs than the ssrs derived from genomic libraries  <cit> . contrarily, a high level of polymorphism was detected in present case irrespective of the camellia species. this is in agreement with some earlier studies that reported high  <cit>  to even higher level of polymorphism with est-ssr markers than genomic ssrs markers  <cit> . furthermore, the ability to detect per primer a higher number of alleles than zhao et al.  <cit>  might be due to high abundance of di-repeats containing ugms primer pairs . however, the average number of alleles observed in this study remained comparatively lower than that for genomic microstellites  reported by freeman et al.  <cit>  and hung et al.  <cit> . detection of larger amplicons than the expected in few cases was probably due to the presence of introns which were excluded during processing of hnrna into mrna. alternatively, multi-locus amplification detected with limited cases, were probably due to duplication and heterozygosity in tea, as was previously reported in tall fescue  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . the mean pic estimated for genomic ssrs in tea  <cit> , is higher than the estimated mean pic for ugms markers in the present study. the mean heterozygosities expected  and observed  estimates were also slightly less in the present study  <cit> . further, test for iam  and smm models  for the ugms loci showed excess heterozygosity in sign test and found to be significant in standardized and wilcoxon test suggested that the studied marker loci did not show any bottleneck operating in the tea population and remain highly out breeding.

cross species amplification and sequence comparison of ugms markers
ugms markers identified in present study are highly transferable with in species and, frequently among species as reported in barley  <cit> . for instance, all the  <dig> ugms markers developed for c. sinensis are fully transferable to c. assamica &c. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx, and at the various levels to c. lutescens; c. irrawadiensis, c. japonica white flower and c. japonica red flower. similar pattern of cross transferability has been recorded in case of genomic ssrs in earlier studies in tea  <cit> . interestingly, there were  <dig>  of the ugms primer pairs which recorded cross-transferability in all the tested species. this suggested possible representation of highly conserved genes with some important biological/cellular/molecular functions. further, conservation of repeat motif sequences at the species level and even at the multiple amplicons from the diploid genotypes suggests the wider utility of ugms markers. conservation of multiple repeats in diploid genotypes suggests presence of paralogs due to duplication of a particular locus within the genome.

ugms markers for evaluation of inter and intra specific genetic variations
the results obtained with  <dig> accessions tested from six tea species indicate that ugms markers could be utilized for evaluation of genetic relationships within and at the species level. the genetic similarity matrix obtained from the two methods  was significantly correlated confirm the utility of ugms markers in tea. the genetic relationship among the cultivated c. sinensis, c. assamica and c. assamica ssp lasicalayx accessions reported in this study  is comparable with rapd based genetic relationship in  <dig> keneyan accessions by wachira et al.  <cit> . however, overall an extensive genetic variation was obtained at the intra and inter species level among the  <dig> accessions  <cit> . the difference in gs might be due to the use of different markers which most likely assay variation in the different genomic regions. however, ssr variation within the genic regions should be very critical for gene activity. few of the ugms markers that have shown significant hits in the arabidopsis proteome can occupy certain positions in coding regions. expansion and contraction of ssr repeats with known function in these regions might help to establish the association with phenotypic variation as reported earlier in the case of rice  <cit>  and should detect "true genetic diversity" in crop species  <cit> .

cluster analysis of  <dig> tea accessions representing c. sinensis and related species revealed genetic affinities , which were broadly in agreement with known taxonomic classification of tea  <cit> . traditionally, cambod is considered a sub group of assam type or sometimes referred to as a subspecies of assamica known as lasiocalyx  <cit> , therefore, majority of c. assamica  and c. assamica ssp. lasiocalyx  tea accessions were clustered together in group ii with high bootstrap values. betjan 3/ <dig>  a fast growing, high quality tea accession, being an extreme assam type was also clustered in this group  <cit> . tea accessions namely tv- <dig> and tv- <dig> are moderately tolerant to tolerant to drought and hence clustered as a distinct subgroup under the major group ii. possible explanation of clustering tv- <dig>  and 124/53/ <dig>  as an intermediate group between ornamental and cultivated accessions is due to their development from progenies of open pollinated seeds. tv- <dig> developed, introduced by t.c. tunstall in the year  <dig> was selected from progenies 124/53/ <dig> and 124/41/ <dig> of st. <dig> developed through open pollinated seeds collected from plants of 19/ <dig>  <cit> . further, c. irrawadiensis clustered along with two accessions of c. japonica, with red and white flowers in group iii suggesting a possibility of introgressive hybridization between these two species. in general, limited introgressive hybridization had occurred in wild/ornamental species because of small populations and narrow geographical distributions. this might also be the reason for clustering of c. lutescens as a single solitary out-group in the present study. conversely, self incompatibility and long term allogamy make the cultivated tea accessions highly heterogeneous and consequently with broad genetic variations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed the insight of abundance and distribution of microsatellite in the expressed component of the tea genome. sixty one ugms markers developed and experimentally validated for genetic diversity analysis in different camellia spp. will be enriching the limited existing microsatellite markers resource in tea. most of the ugms primers were highly polymorphic and were able to unambiguously differentiate the tea germplasm at the inter and intra specific levels. the use of these markers would reduce the cost and facilitate genetic diversity assessment, gene mapping and marker-aided selection in tea. functional categorization of these ugms markers corresponded to many genes with biological, cellular and molecular functions, and hence offer an opportunity to investigate the consequences of ssr polymorphism on gene functions.
