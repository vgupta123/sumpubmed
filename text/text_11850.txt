BACKGROUND
chlorinated dioxins are a large class of environmental contaminants generated as by-products of a variety of industrial processes  <cit> . dioxin exposure can lead to a variety of toxic outcomes, and concerns surrounding widespread human exposure have led many of these to be extensively studied in model organisms . to date, most studies of dioxin-induced toxicity have focused on the most potent and toxic congener,  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin . at high doses, tcdd has been associated with numerous toxic outcomes in humans, including severe chloracne, neurotoxicity and tumourigenesis . in animal models, even small doses of tcdd have been shown to cause a wide range of toxicities, the severity and duration of which differ among species  <cit> . although the exact mechanism of tcdd-induced toxicities is not completely understood, many studies have demonstrated that the interaction between tcdd and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , a ligand-dependent transcription factor, plays a critical role in mediating them . the ahr typically resides quiescently as a cytoplasmic complex with its chaperone proteins heat shock protein  <dig>  and ahr-interacting protein . upon ligand binding, the ahr translocates to the nucleus where it disaggregates from the chaperone proteins and. heterodimerizes with the ahr nuclear translocator   <cit> . the resulting complex binds to aryl hydrocarbon response elements  in dna and alters the transcription of target genes such as cyp1a <dig> .

the link between ahr-regulated transcriptional events and tcdd-induced toxicities was established by several experimental approaches. ahr knockout mice demonstrated increased resistance to most tcdd-induced toxicities, relative to wild-type mice  <cit> . similarly, mice expressing mutations which prevent nuclear translocation, heterodimerization of ahr with arnt, or ahre binding are highly refractory to dioxin-induced toxicities  <cit> . in addition, mice lacking hepatic arnt show reduced hepatotoxicity following treatment with tcdd  <cit> . these studies indicate that dna binding of ligand-activated ahr is essential for the development of tcdd-induced toxic effects. in order to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which tcdd and the ahr elicit toxic outcomes, several groups have examined the ahr-mediated transcriptional events in various animal models and tissues following tcdd exposure . interestingly, the sensitivity of animals to tcdd-induced lethality was found to vary largely among species as well as between different strains within a species  . one possible explanation for this variation involves the structure of the ahr: different isoforms were found to exist between species and strains which can be associated with the various toxicity phenotypes .table  <dig> tcdd sensitivity differences among animal models

the role of the ahr becomes less clear when evaluating differences in toxic outcomes observed between male and female animals within the same strain  <cit> . while there was no difference in the sequence or structure of the ahr between male and female c57bl/ <dig> mice, females were refractory to the typical toxic outcomes of tcdd  <cit> . other studies have demonstrated differential susceptibility of male and female c57bl/ <dig> mice for a wide range of endpoints, including acute lethality, wasting syndrome, leukocytopenia and liver damage  <cit> . several studies suggest a complex interaction between the ahr and estrogen   and androgen receptors   <cit> , which may partly explain the different tcdd-induced outcomes between sexes. however, the specific role of these receptors remains unclear. female mice and guinea pigs are more resistant to tcdd-induced lethality than their male counterparts, while in rats, the sensitivity profiles are reversed, with females being the more tcdd-sensitive sex  <cit> .

to further investigate this issue, a dose–response experiment was conducted on male and female c57bl/6kuo mice and the hepatic transcriptomic profiles were evaluated with the intention of identifying sex-dependent/tcdd-mediated transcriptional events. furthermore, a meta-analysis was performed using data from a similar time-course experiment in male and female mice  <cit>  and using previous studies of rats under similar conditions  in hopes of unravelling the mechanisms involved in producing the divergent tcdd-induced toxicities.

RESULTS
to identify specific changes in mrna abundance associated with differential tcdd-induced toxicities observed in male and female c57bl/ <dig> mice, the hepatic transcriptome was profiled. specifically, male and female c57bl/6kuo mice were treated with either corn oil alone or a single dose of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 1000 μg/kg tcdd in corn oil. it was previously demonstrated that survivor rates varied significantly between male and female animals within this range  <cit> , with the lower tcdd doses being below the ld <dig> for male mice, and all doses being well tolerated by female mice . in addition, a significant difference in plasma alat  activities between sexes existed 4 days post-exposure regardless of dose  <cit> . therefore hepatic tissue was profiled 4 days after exposure to identify sex-specific transcriptomic changes . it is important to note that while the higher doses of tcdd  are lethal to male mice of this strain, lethality does not occur until day  <dig> at the earliest  <cit>  hence animals were not yet moribund at this early time point.fig.  <dig> experimental design. adult c57bl/6kuo mice  were divided into five treatment groups per sex. each group received a single dose of tcdd in corn oil  or corn oil alone. livers were excised 4 days after treatment and rna was isolated and hybridized to affymetrix mouse gene  <dig>  st arrays. data for each sex were pre-processed and modelled separately. results for male and female cohorts were then combined. those genes determined to be significantly altered by treatment were identified and downstream analyses, including pattern recognition and function analyses, were performed. a meta-analysis was performed through integration of data from  <dig> rodent-tcdd studies and additional analyses were performed to identify trends



overview of transcriptomic profiles
following data pre-processing, transcripts showing the most variable intensities were subjected to hierarchical clustering to visualize abundance patterns between treatment groups . unsurprisingly, distinct transcriptomic profiles exist between male and female animals , with further differences easily observed between tcdd treated and control animals within each sex. the adjusted rand index  was calculated to quantitate this clustering. cluster sizes of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were evaluated. as expected, perfect agreement was identified for the partition based on sex , moderate agreement existed for the combination of sex and dose , while no agreement existed for treatment or dose alone .fig.  <dig> summary of transcriptomic profiles. a rma normalized intensity values for genes with the highest variance across all samples  were visualized; clear sex-specific and treatment-specific  abundance patterns were observed. intensity values for each sample were clustered with the diana hierarchical clustering algorithm, with pearson’s correlation as a similarity metric. shading  represents rma normalized intensity values. b linear modeling was performed to identify differences between treatment and control groups. each sex was evaluated separately and results combined after modeling was applied. the legend indicates the experimental  relative to male vehicle control animals). the number of genes determined to be significantly altered at a range of fdr-adjusted p-value thresholds were examined across experimental groups. c results  were compared between male and female mice for each dosage group. pearson’s correlation indicated increasing similarity between transcriptomic profiles of male and female mice as tcdd dose was increased. overlap of significantly altered genes following each dose of tcdd in  male and  female cohorts



to quantify transcriptomic differences, linear modeling was performed to compare treated and control groups for each sex. coefficients from the linear model provide the magnitude of difference between treated and control animals , while modified t-tests were used to determine significance of differences between groups, followed by false discovery rate adjustment. the number of genes altered at various significance thresholds was assessed for each treatment group . in general, male mice showed more transcriptional changes following tcdd exposure than female mice at the same dose. to compare magnitude of change following treatment, the coefficients for each dose were compared between male and female mice, with pearson’s correlation used to ascertain similarity across the transcriptome . the largest divergence between the sexes occurs at the lowest dose ; a subset of transcripts showed increased abundance relative to control animals in only male animals following this dosage.

to further evaluate the extent of changes across the dose–response spectrum, the number of genes determined to be significantly altered  were compared for each sex. using these thresholds, male mice showed  <dig> transcripts altered across all doses, however a greater number of transcripts were consistently observed at doses below the ld <dig> for these animals . conversely, females showed more genes altered at higher doses, and had only  <dig> transcripts altered at all four doses .

conserved transcriptomic responses
exposure to tcdd elicits transcriptional regulation through activation of the ahr  <cit> . therefore, we examined  <dig> “ahr-core” genes  that have previously been established to be altered following exposure to tcdd in various species and tissue types  <cit> . these are genes typically involved in xenobiotic metabolism and the adaptive response to cellular stress. in general, the abundance profiles of these genes were similar between male and female mice . six genes  showed significant alteration in all cohorts. nfe2l <dig> demonstrated similar magnitudes of induction following tcdd exposure in all treatment groups; however differences in abundance between treated and control groups were more statistically significant in female mice. similarly, inmt was altered only in female mice ; however the magnitude of induction was below our threshold. therefore, none of the “ahr-core” genes were deemed to show sex-dependent differences in response to tcdd exposure.fig.  <dig> transcriptomic responses of genes of interest. two subsets of genes were selected for visualization and comparison with additional datasets:  <dig> “ahr-core” genes and  <dig> genes determined to be significantly altered  following all four doses of tcdd in either male or female mice. the magnitude , direction  and significance  of changes relative to control animals are shown. results for the “ahr-core” genes  and genes of interest  are shown from both  dose response and  time-course analyses. covariates along the top indicate sample treatment while  demonstrate the presence or absence of ahre motifs and ahr-binding, as determined by chip-chip analysis



the current dose response experiment only allows us to observe mrna abundance changes 4 days after exposure. therefore, results from a published time-course study  <cit>  were added for comparison and the “ahr-core” genes were examined as above . aldh3a <dig> and fmo <dig> were unaltered following tcdd treatment, regardless of dose or length of treatment. interestingly, ahrr and cyp1b <dig> were altered in livers of both male and female mice only at later time points. differences in hepatic response between male and female mice for nqo <dig> and inmt may be due to differences in the number of animals in each group between the studies .table  <dig> number of animals available per experimental group

in order to better interpret the role of the ahr in regulating these genes, both transcription factor binding site  analysis and ahr-binding analysis were performed . the presence or absence of various ahre motifs, as well as the detection of ahr-binding by chip-chip for “ahr-core” genes is shown . only fmo <dig> displayed an absence of ahre motifs in the region examined, while only tiparp demonstrated ahr-binding in this study.

sex-dependent transcriptomic responses
since male and female c57bl/ <dig> mice present divergent susceptibilities to dioxin-induced acute lethality, we sought to identify sex-dependent tcdd-responsive genes. using the same dual threshold of log2|fold-change| >  <dig> and padj 
<  <dig>  used above,  <dig> genes were significantly altered at all four doses in either male  or female  mouse liver. overlap between male and female hepatic transcriptomic response following each tcdd dose is shown in additional file  <dig>  to further refine this list a more stringent threshold of log2|fold-change| >  <dig>  and padj 
<  <dig>  was applied, resulting in a set of  <dig> “candidate” genes with sex-dependent responses to tcdd . of these, the most notable sex-dependent response was observed for flavin containing monooxygenase  <dig> . the protein product of this gene is involved in the oxidation of numerous xenobiotics. this gene is significantly induced following tcdd exposure in male livers, a result that has been described previously  <cit> . while fmo <dig> was significantly altered in all cohorts examined, the magnitude of change in female livers was smaller than that in male livers. similarly, five additional genes were significantly altered across both males and females in the dose response study; however the magnitude of these changes reached the selected threshold in only male  or female liver .

the identification of sex-specific tcdd-responsive “candidate” genes was based solely on a single time-point and may be picking up secondary transcriptional events. however, the reduced tcdd sensitivity in female mice may be a result of rapid adaptive capabilities. therefore, the “candidate” genes were further examined along time-course  <cit>   to identify whether the candidates exhibit early or late changes. as expected, fmo <dig> mrna abundance displayed an evident temporal response in male liver, with abundance increasing along the time-course. many “candidate” genes  showed altered abundance at only the later time-points examined , likely indicating secondary responses to exposure. strikingly, dclk <dig>  which encodes a protein kinase, displayed significantly altered hepatic abundance in only female mice along the dose response study, but was primarily altered in only male mice along the time-course study, with modest changes observed at 6 h post-exposure in females  <cit> . also of interest, uncharacterized protein loc <dig>  – a lncrna implicated in guiding site-specific methylation of rrnas and moderately expressed in normal liver of male mice  <cit>  – showed increased abundance in male hepatic tissue at all doses at 4 days post-exposure, as well as at 3 days post-exposure in the time-course study. in contrast, this transcript showed decreased abundance at early time-points in female hepatic tissue .

as with the “ahr-core” genes, “candidate” genes were examined for ahre motifs and ahr-binding . although ahre motifs were detected in most candidate genes , only two  demonstrated ahr-binding by chip-chip  <cit> . abtb <dig> was significantly down-regulated following treatment  in only male livers. no ahre motifs were discovered within the searched region of the serpina <dig> gene, which was significantly down-regulated in female livers along the dose response, as well as in both male and female livers at later time points  <cit> .

functional analysis tcdd-responsive genes
to provide insight into the biological functions of tcdd-responsive genes in hepatic tissue of male and female mice, a pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the significantly altered genes  within each cohort. gene ontologies that were significantly enriched  in each cohort were identified and comparisons were made between the sexes at each dose . surprisingly there were no significantly enriched go terms in male liver at the lowest dose , despite this cohort having the most altered genes . conversely, female liver showed  <dig> enriched terms at this low dose, despite a fewer number of genes. at higher doses, male and female hepatic tissues demonstrate similar numbers and significant overlap  of enriched pathways . we identified  <dig> go terms that displayed significant enrichment in a sex-specific manner . interestingly, the majority of these were female-specific and include ontologies such as carbohydrate and alcohol metabolic processes . two pathways were enriched in a male-specific manner: translation elongation and fatty acid biosynthesis . interestingly, these pathways are enriched following only lethal doses  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pathway analysis. significantly altered genes  were identified for each sex/dose combination and used for pathway analysis . gene ontologies that were determined to be significantly enriched  at multiple  tcdd doses in either male or female mice are shown. dot size indicates enrichment values while background shading represents fdr-adjusted p-values



alterations of tcdd-responsive genes in different biological contexts
finally, we sought to exploit our understanding of sex-associated transcriptional profiles to identify candidate drivers of dioxin toxicities. because male and female mice show differential sensitivity to dioxin toxicities, we hypothesized that genes showing transcriptional differences between them might also drive differential sensitivity to dioxin toxicities in other model systems. we therefore integrated sex-specific changes with tcdd-dependent transcriptomic alterations in a variety of biological contexts . these studies administered equitoxic doses of tcdd in sensitive rats and mice   <cit> . regardless of species, the transcriptomic changes induced by tcdd treatment were more pronounced in hepatic tissue, particularly at the later time-point examined. few transcripts were statistically significantly altered in either hypothalamic or adipose tissues in rats. in hepatic tissue, a higher number of altered genes were observed in the dioxin-sensitive groups  than in the dioxin-resistant groups  both at 1 day  and 4 days  post-exposure. in hepatic tissue, there was minimal overlap among phenotypic groups, 4 days after treatment.table  <dig> summary of datasets for meta-analysis

with the exception of cyp1a <dig> and nqo <dig>  minimal conservation was observed among the response of “ahr-core” genes to tcdd exposure across studies. nfe2l <dig> and tiparp were altered in hepatic tissue of all organisms, while altered aldh3a <dig> was limited to rat liver . outside of the “ahr-core” genes,  <dig> genes were determined to be significantly altered  in both tcdd-sensitive cohorts  while  <dig> genes were altered primarily in the resistant subtypes .

of those genes showing a sex-specific response 4 days after exposure to tcdd,  <dig> demonstrated significantly altered abundance in only male liver  while  <dig> were altered in only female liver . when compared with other biological contexts, gpd <dig> was altered in only the liver of male mice  while gls <dig> was additionally altered in liver tissue of l-e rats at both  <dig> and 4 days after exposure . in female mouse liver, gstp <dig> and ugdh were altered at both time points however were not altered in any of the additional cohorts examined. alternatively, eml <dig> and exoc <dig> were additionally altered in hepatic tissue of both rat strains at both time points, while il1r <dig> was altered in only the resistant subtypes . ultimately, no genes were significantly altered exclusively to all of the sensitive- or resistant- phenotypes examined suggesting that these diverse models of dioxin sensitivity and resistance are driven by different genes. however, gls <dig> was altered in livers of both the tcdd-sensitive male mouse and l-e rat. gls <dig> encodes a glutaminase involved in reducing levels of reactive oxidative species   <cit> . the reduced abundance of this transcript observed in tcdd-sensitive organisms may lead to increased intracellular ros and subsequent toxicities. livers of both female mice and h/w rat demonstrated significant induction of il1r <dig>  suggesting an enhanced immune response by these organisms.

discussion
sensitivities to tcdd-mediated toxicities differ vastly across animal models. we have previously studied the hepatic transcriptomic responses to tcdd exposure in various strains of rats and mice, where various ahr isoforms have been shown to play a role in mediating differential sensitivity phenotypes  <cit> . unfortunately, identifying the specific mechanisms by which differential toxicity occurs has proven difficult. recently, studies have attempted to minimize the effect of genetic variation among different species and/or strains through the use of transgenic mice  <cit> . the current study attempts to minimize the impact of genetic variation by exploiting the differences in dioxin-sensitivities among male and female animals within the same genetic background. therefore, characterization of the sex-specific tcdd-mediated transcriptomic changes may provide valuable information on the mechanisms of divergent tcdd-induced toxicities, independent of the ahr.

our examination of hepatic transcriptomic profiles along both dose response and time-course experiments revealed several key findings. first, the general response patterns to tcdd exposure of male and female mice in terms of hepatic mrna abundance are evidently different between the sexes  <cit> . of the ~ <dig>  actively expressed hepatic genes in mice  <cit> , ~72 % have been described as being sexually dimorphic, with a fairly equal split between female- and male-biased genes  <cit> . following treatment with tcdd, livers of female mice displayed a smaller number of altered transcripts relative to their corn-oil-treated counterparts than did male livers. this difference between male and female hepatic response is consistent along the dose response, however this was not the case early in the time-course  <cit> , suggesting that this is a result of the longer exposure time. these results affirm that exposure to tcdd induces more transcriptomic alterations in the livers of male mice regardless of dose and as early as 1 day after exposure. this suggests a relationship between the quantity of transcriptomic changes and the increased sensitivity to lethality observed in male mice  <cit> .

second, the “ahr-core” gene response is relatively conserved across all cohorts. transcriptomic changes can be categorized as either primary, mediated directly by dioxin-activated ahr, or secondary, those changes brought about by the onset of toxicity. the observed conservation of the “ahr-core” gene responses between the sexes, in particular the induction of classic ahr-regulated genes, such as cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig> and cyp1b <dig>  suggests that ahr activity alone may not be the key factor determining the differential phenotypic response. further evidence for this hypothesis comes from previous studies of cyp1a1-null mice  <cit>  in which susceptibilities to tcdd toxicities, including acute lethality, remained consistently different between the sexes. in addition, response patterns of these mrna species have been shown to be conserved in both the tcdd-sensitive long-evans  and tcdd-resistant han/wistar  rats  <cit> . this further suggests that a group of genes outside of the “ahr-core” subset may be responsible for the difference in tcdd-induced toxicities.

third, as alluded to above, a subset of “candidate” genes that exhibit sex-dependent response patterns was found to exist. therefore, it is hypothesized that changes in abundance of these genes may result in either harmful  or beneficial  effects regarding tcdd toxicity. further, altered abundance of these “candidate” genes may lead to downstream changes in pathway activities, and ultimately result in the observed toxicity outcomes.

in particular, our results demonstrate strong induction of fmo <dig> by tcdd at all doses examined in hepatic tissue of male mice. while basal expression of fmo <dig> is considerably higher in female liver than in male liver, this induction results in mrna levels that are similar to those observed in tcdd-treated female liver. fmo <dig> has been extensively studied in tcdd-treated mouse models  <cit> . the expression pattern of fmo <dig> varies largely between mouse and rat - this enzyme is constitutively expressed at higher levels in livers of female mice but virtually absent in livers of adult males while, in rats, abundance levels appear to be independent of sex  <cit> . it is also important to note that sex steroids have opposite effects on abundance of fmo <dig> between the two species. testosterone has been shown to suppress expression and activity of fmo <dig> in mice, while female sex hormones had the opposite effect  <cit> . conversely, testosterone has been shown to positively regulate the fmo gene family, while treatment with estradiol reduced fmo expression in rats  <cit> . similarly, nr1i <dig>  which encodes the constitutive androstane receptor , was shown to be significantly upregulated following all doses  of tcdd and multiple time points  in male mice. nr1i <dig> can also be significantly suppressed by testosterone exposure  <cit> . tcdd-mediated sex steroid reduction has been well-demonstrated in previous studies, where exposure of tcdd significantly decreased testosterone, progesterone and estradiol in an ahr-dependent manner  <cit> . reduced testosterone levels following tcdd-exposure may relate to the increased abundance of nr1i <dig> observed in our studies  <cit> . in addition, complex interactions have been described between the ahr and the estrogen  and androgen  receptors, in which ligand-activated ahr acts as both a transcriptional co-regulator for and promotor of degradation of the erα and ar  <cit> . taken together, this suggests that tcdd treatment alters the actions of sex hormones, either directly or indirectly through modulation of receptor activity, negatively regulating testosterone activities in male mice, thereby reducing the suppression of fmo <dig>  the opposite effect of testosterone on fmo <dig> in rats may also explain the reverse patterns of sex-dependent sensitivity to tcdd exposure. multiple biological pathways were identified that displayed significant enrichment of altered genes following exposure to tcdd in a sex-dependent manner. while none of these were directly related to the above discussion of sex steroids and receptors, female livers showed an enrichment of altered genes involved in the inhibition of peptidase activity and cofactor binding, as well as various metabolic processes. this may allow female mice to better handle toxic metabolites and oxidative stress brought on by exposure to tcdd. the livers of male mice demonstrated enrichment of pathways related to translational elongation and fatty acid biosynthesis. many of those genes demonstrating altered abundance associated with the translational elongation pathway are ribosomal components. a connection could be hypothesized between expression of these rrnas and the increased abundance of the lncrna 1500012f01rik . enhanced synthesis of fatty acids may relate to the decreased body weight experienced by male mice following exposure to tcdd.

CONCLUSIONS
the divergent responses to tcdd exposure in male and female c57bl/ <dig> mice have been verified at the transcriptomic level. the primary responses directly regulated by the classical ahr-activation pathway are consistent, regardless of sex. several sex-specific tcdd-responsive genes have been identified in hepatic tissue which may be associated with the differential sensitivities to tcdd induced toxicities. moreover, different biological pathways demonstrated a significant enrichment of altered genes following tcdd exposure between the sexes. previous studies have demonstrated a complex interaction between ligand-activated ahr and the activities of sex hormones and receptors  <cit> . the current findings indicate altered abundance of specific genes may be involved in the differential phenotypic toxicities observed in male and female mice following exposure to tcdd. further work is necessary to fully understand the specific mechanistic roles of sex hormones and associated receptors in these tcdd-induced toxicities.
