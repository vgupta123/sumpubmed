BACKGROUND
dna replication is an essential event for all living organisms, and thus the basic mechanism is conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes. genomic dna replication must be executed accurately and only once during the s phase of the cell cycle. rapid and accurate dna replication requires the assembly of a large number of proteins, termed the replisome, which directs major reactions, such as origin recognition, template dna unwinding, and primer extension. accumulating evidence has identified the essential proteins for dna replication, which have helped to provide a better understanding of the complex puzzle of dna replication  <cit> . for example, in eukaryotes, a heterohexamer composed of the mcm2-mcm <dig> subunits works as the mcm helicase to unwind the template dna, but this helicase activity is very low in vitro  <cit> . while schwacha's group demonstrated the significant helicase activity of yeast mcm2- <dig> alone  <cit> , extra protein factors, which enhance the mcm helicase activity, have been found, and in particular, cdc <dig>  mcm, and gins form a complex called the unwindosome or the cmg complex, which plays an essential role in the template dna unwinding reaction, and thus this complex is considered to be the functional replicative helicase  <cit> . gins, named from the japanese go-ichi-ni-san, meaning 5-1-2- <dig>  is a heterotetramer in eukaryotes, comprising the sld <dig>  psf <dig>  psf <dig>  and psf <dig> subunits, and is essential for both initiation and elongation in dna replication  <cit> . gins is recruited to the replication origin with dpb <dig> and sld <dig> for the initiation and may functionally interact with dna polymerase ε  <cit> . a functional interaction between human gins and dna polymerase α/primase complex is also reported  <cit> , indicating its important role to move from initiation to elongation of the dna replication. gins actually forms a transient complex, designated as the preloading complex , with dna polymerase ε, sld <dig>  and dpb <dig>  in a cyclin-dependent kinase -dependent manner in budding yeast  <cit> .

in  <dig>  three research groups reported the crystal structures of human gins. together, they showed a rigid and stable tetrameric core structure, with multiple flexible surface regions that are important for functional interactions with other dna replication proteins  <cit> . each subunit of human gins consists of an α-helical main domain and a β-stranded small domain, and assembles into the heterotetramer, which exhibits a unique trapezoidal or ellipsoidal shape. interestingly, the four subunits share a similar fold, in spite of the low amino acid sequence identity of at most 15%. furthermore, they are classified into two groups. one group, including human sld <dig> and psf <dig>  possesses the α-helical  domain at the n-terminus and the β-stranded one  at the c-terminus , and the other group, comprising human psf <dig> and psf <dig>  is the permuted version   <cit> .

it is well known that the dna metabolizing proteins from archaea are similar to those from eukaryotes, in both structure and function  <cit> . furthermore, the archaeal dna replication system appears to be a simplified version of the eukaryotic one. therefore, structural studies of the archaeal system could be beneficial to understand the more complex dna replication mechanism of eukaryotes. bioinformatics analyses using genomic information from archaea and eukaryotes suggested that the archaeal gins complexes are simplified versions of the eukaryotic complexes. the archaeal complexes are probably either α2β <dig> type tetramers composed of the two types of subunits or α <dig> type homotetramers of a single subunit, suggesting that the four different eukaryotic gins subunits had diverged from a common ancestor  <cit> . the functional tetrameric assembly of the archaeal gins has been proved by biochemical analyses. an archaeal gins homologue was first identified in sulfolobus solfataricus, as a binding partner of mcm  <cit> . the gins complex from pyrococcus furiosus increases the cognate mcm helicase activity, in a similar manner to eukaryotic gins, in spite of the lack of a eukaryotic cdc <dig> homolog  <cit> . due to the low sequence similarity between the archaeal and eukaryotic gins subunits, information about the three-dimensional structure of archaeal gins complexes is crucial to obtain clearer insights into the functional subunit assembly.

in this paper, we report the crystal structure of the α2β <dig> gins tetramer from thermococcus kodakaraensis , which consists of the gins <dig> and gins <dig> subunits. this first crystal structure of an archaeal gins was compared with that of human gins. the overall fold of each subunit and the tetrameric assembly of tkogins are essentially similar to those of human gins. however, the locations of the c-terminal small domains are strikingly different between the two gins, thus resulting in the formation of different subunit contacts in the complexes. based on the two gins crystal structures, we built a homology model of the putative homotetrameric gins from thermoplasma acidophilum , and found that tacgins could form the tetrameric subunit structure, in a similar manner to the α2β <dig> tkogins tetramer and the human gins heterotetramer. these results suggest that the basic function of gins in dna replication is conserved across the domains of life.

RESULTS
structure of tkogins
the crystal structure of tkogins was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method with anomalous dispersion , and the atomic model was refined at  <dig>  Å . the crystal contains one pair of the gins <dig> and gins <dig> subunits in the asymmetric unit, and the protein forms the α2β <dig> tetramer generated by the crystallographic two-fold symmetry operation .

armerge = /Σi |ii|, where < ii > is the mean ii over symmetry-equivalent reflections.

brwork =Σ|fo - fc |/Σ|fo| for all data excluding data used to calculate rfree.

crfree was calculated using 5% of the total reflections, which were chosen randomly and omitted from the refinement.

gins <dig> is composed of the larger α-helical domain at the n-terminus, and the smaller β-stranded domain at the c-terminus. in the gins <dig> subunit, the long linker region between the two domains is disordered in the crystal, and  <dig> residues could not be assigned in the electron density map. therefore, although we built an atomic model with the c-terminal domain contacting the nearest n-terminal one, the positions of the c-terminal domains may be swapped between the two gins <dig> subunits to those in the tetrameric structure. gins <dig> also possesses similar structural domains as in gins <dig>  but the order of the two domains in the sequence is permutated. each domain of gins <dig> can be separately superimposed on that of gins <dig>  the gins <dig> n-terminal domain superimposed on the gins <dig> c-terminal one with a root mean square deviation  of  <dig>  Å, using the corresponding  <dig> cα atoms, and the gins <dig> c-terminal domain superimposed on the gins <dig> n-terminal one with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å, using  <dig> cα atoms.

architectural comparison between the t. kodakaraensis and human gins complexes
the tko gins tetrameric structure is similar, in terms of shape and size, to the human gins complex, comprising the four different subunits, sld <dig>  psf <dig>  psf <dig> and psf <dig>  <cit> . while both crystal structures contain a narrow central hole, an electron microscopic analysis of human gins revealed a horseshoe-shaped structure with a large central hole  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that gins undergoes a conformational change between the open and closed forms, and the crystal structure exhibits a closed state. as expected, the spatial location of the tkogins <dig> subunit in the tetramer corresponds to those in human sld <dig> and psf <dig>  and that of tkogins <dig> corresponds to those of psf <dig> and psf <dig> . tkogins <dig> from the upper layer superimposed onto human sld <dig> and psf <dig> with rmsds of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, using  <dig> and  <dig> cα atoms in the a domains, respectively . in the case of the lower layer subunits, the two gins <dig> subunit structures are entirely similar to their human counterparts, including the relative locations between the two domains. indeed, tkogins <dig> superimposed onto psf <dig> with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å using  <dig> cα atoms, and onto psf <dig> with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å using  <dig> cα atoms. these structural similarities highlight the evolutionary conservation between the archaeal and eukaryotic gins complexes . notably, swiatek and macneill reported the structural similarity between the b domains of the human gins proteins and the c-terminal domain  of the primase small subunit -ctd) from sulfolobus solfataricus  <cit> . the b domains of the tkogins subunits are also similar to pris-ctd , supporting an interesting hypothesis that archaeal pris acquired its ctd by straightforward sequence duplication.

despite the similarities in the internal architecture of each subunit and the overall morphology of the tetrameric subunit assembly, notable differences are observed between the archaeal and human gins complexes. firstly, the locations of the c-terminal b domains are strikingly different between the archaeal gins <dig> and the human sld <dig>  in the superimposed structures, the tkogins <dig> b domain is located about  <dig> Å away from that of human sld <dig> . in the human complex, the b domain of sld <dig> contributes to the stable tetramer formation, and the observed location in the crystal structure is in fact important for its function  <cit> .

on the other hand, the corresponding domain of human psf <dig> is highly mobile. kamada et al. and choi et al. crystallized the gins proteins lacking the psf <dig> b domain  <cit> . although chang et al. solved the crystal structure of the full-length gins, they could not observe the electron density for the psf <dig> b-domain in the crystal  <cit> . thus, to determine whether the gins <dig> b domain is required for the stable tetramer formation, we examined the oligomeric state of a tkogins truncation mutant, lacking the b domain of gins <dig>  by gel filtration. as shown in figure 3a, this truncation mutant forms a stable tetramer, establishing that the c-terminal b domain of gins <dig> is not essential for stable tetramer formation. notably, the isolated gins <dig> subunit forms a dimer irrespective of the presence or absence of the c-terminal b domain, and the isolated gins <dig> also eluted as a dimer . it is presently unclear whether the tkogins <dig> b domain occupies a functional position, as in the corresponding domain of human sld <dig>  or is incidentally fixed there, due to crystal packing . however, the mobility of this b domain is conserved from archaea to human, and hence it seems likely that these movements of the b domain are required for the function of gins complexes.

comparison of subunit contacts
a second difference was observed in the subunit contacts, particularly between the upper and lower layers . overall, the archaeal gins51-gins <dig>  and gins23-gins <dig>  interactions are similar to those of the corresponding contacts, sld5-psf <dig> and psf2-psf <dig>  of the human gins, respectively. they all exhibit a similar intermolecular four α-helix bundle structure, in which two α-helices from each subunit contribute to the contact. on the other hand, the contact between gins <dig> and gins <dig>  is strikingly different from the corresponding sld5-psf <dig>  or psf1-psf <dig>  interactions of human gins. this difference could be attributed to the relative orientations between the upper and lower subunits.

the contact between the upper and lower layer subunits could be divided into two areas: one involves the a domain from the upper layer subunit and the b domain from the lower layer subunit , while the other involves the a domain from the lower layer subunit. in tkogins, the first contact area is formed mainly between the aα <dig> helix of gins <dig> and the prominent bα <dig> helix of gins <dig>  and additionally between the aα <dig> helix of gins <dig> and the n-terminal loop of gins <dig> . we found that the intermolecular helix-helix interaction is similarly observed in the human gins structures, although the detailed contact modes, that is, the amino acid residues, contributing to the contact, are different between them . however, a tryptophan residue is notably conserved among tkogins <dig>  and human psf <dig>  and psf <dig>  in this area . our preliminary analysis suggested that this tryptophan residue is conserved among the lower layer subunits from eukaryotes and archaea . therefore, it is tempting to speculate that this contact may be a key factor to generate the similar tetramer formation between the archaeal and human gins complexes.

on the other hand, the upper-lower layer subunit contact in the second area varies among the three interactions, in terms of the relative orientations between the upper and lower subunits. tkogins <dig> is located close to gins <dig>  allowing the c-terminal aα <dig> helix to interact with the aα <dig> helix of gins <dig> . in the corresponding area of the human sld5-psf <dig> interaction, the c-terminal a domain of psf <dig> is farther away from sld <dig>  as compared to tkogins. instead, it is the b domain of sld <dig> that faces psf <dig>  to form a broad contact surface . this could be the reason why the sld <dig> b domain in human gins is required for stable complex formation  <cit> . conversely, the corresponding b domain of tkogins <dig> may be dispensable for tetramer formation, because gins <dig> and gins <dig> can interact with each other without the gins <dig> b domain. in addition, the corresponding interaction is missing between human psf <dig> and psf <dig>  due to the high mobility of the b domain of psf <dig> and the distance between the c-terminal a domains of psf <dig> and psf <dig>  instead, the n-terminal loop of psf <dig> contacts the a domain of psf <dig>  but this segment is reportedly dispensable for tetramer formation  <cit> . notably, tkogins <dig> lacks the corresponding segment at the n-terminus .

the observed similarities and differences between the two-fold symmetric tkogins and the asymmetric human gins may reflect the different evolutional processes from the last universal common ancestor. archaea may have kept the simple subunit composition of gins, which functions better in their simple dna replication system. on the other hand, eukaryotes probably required the heterotetrameric gins so that gins can play multiple roles in their highly coordinated systems.

homology modeling of the tacgins homotetramer
the α2β <dig> tkogins and αα'ββ' human gins complexes share a similar tetrameric assembly, in spite of the above-mentioned differences in the subunit contacts, implying that this conserved architecture is essential for the gins functions. thus, there is a strong interest in the structure of another type of gins, that is, an archaeal α <dig> homotetrameric gins. gel filtration and electron microscopic analyses showed that tacgins indeed forms a homotetramer . in the absence of the three-dimensional structure of tacgins, we performed homology modeling using the present crystal structure of tkogins.

the crystal structures of the tkogins tetramers revealed a stack of a two-fold symmetric dimer of the ab-type subunits  onto another two-fold symmetric dimer of ba-type subunits . the geometric transformation linking both homodimers requires a simple translation without any rotational component. this is also the situation in the human gins complex, although in that complex, the homodimers are heterodimers. in both cases , the open interfaces at the top and bottom of the tetramer are different from those used for dimer stacking. this asymmetry is the reason why another dimer does not pile up on top of the tetramer. however, if tacgins forms a similar tetramer, composed of a single subunit, then there is no reason why it might not polymerize to form a fiber-like assembly. indeed, in this case, the interface used for dimer-dimer stacking would also exist at the top and bottom of the tetramer and would allow other dimeric modules to assemble. the second problem is the location of the small b domain in the tacgins homotetramer. all of the gins subunits are composed of an a domain and a b domain, but the two domains can be permutated. sld <dig> and psf <dig> of human gins and gins <dig> of tkogins are the ab-type, with the a domain at the n-terminus and the b domain at the c-terminus. the location of the two domains in the sequence is opposite in human psf <dig> and psf <dig> and tkogins <dig>  forming the ba-type. a structure-based sequence alignment  revealed that tacgins is an ab-type subunit. thus, the question arises as to how the authentic gins tetramer can be formed with the only ab-type subunit in the tacgins α <dig> tetramer.

the flexibility in the spatial position of the b domain relative to the a domain, which was revealed by the comparison of tkogins and human gins, and the disorder of the interdomain loop observed in the tkogins structure could provide a reasonable solution for these problems. the solution assumes two types of structural models for the tacgins subunits , which could be possible by using the long  interdomain loop. this loop is much longer than those of the other homologous subunits and is rich in glutamic acid, glutamine, and proline residues, and therefore is likely to form an intrinsically disordered  structure . figure 5c shows a possible homotetramer model of tacgins. this tetramer model appears to simultaneously solve the above-mentioned two problems. on the upper layer, we tentatively placed the b domains of tacgins in a similar orientation to those in the tkogins <dig> subunits . it should be noted that other locations are possible, because as seen in the two gins crystal structures, the b domains of the ab-type subunits could be mobile. for example, human gins was crystallized by truncating the mobile b domain of psf <dig>  <cit> , and in tkogins, the gins <dig> b domain is not required for stable tetramer formation . however, regardless of the location of the b domains, the id-loop should protrude above the two domains, which could prevent the stacking of another dimer on the top interface . on the other hand, on the lower layer, we constructed a model in which the ab-type tacgins mimicked the domain positioning of the ba subunit . the id-loop is long enough for this domain positioning. taken together, the interdomain id-loop of tacgins could play two roles in the homotetramer: to block non-functional polymerization on the tetramer surfaces, and to form a long connector to allow large domain repositioning. in other words, we propose that this long id-loop allows the differential positioning of the b-domains and, as a consequence, exclusively leads to an asymmetric homotetramer, rather than a symmetrical one.

to experimentally validate the predicted tacgins tetramer model, we performed an electron microscopic analysis of tacgins . the two-dimensional class averages thus obtained exhibited various shapes, according to the different orientations of the complex. interestingly, a number of these class averages were very similar to the projections simulated from the predicted tetramer model.

CONCLUSIONS
we determined the  <dig>  Å resolution crystal structure of the first archaeal gins complex from t. kodakaraensis, which forms a α2β <dig> heterotetramer composed of the gins <dig> and gins <dig> subunits. the overall tetrameric structure of the archaeal gins is similar to those of the reported human gins complexes, but the locations of the small domains and the contact modes between the subunits are different between the archaeal and human gins complexes. the gel filtration experiment revealed that the b domain of tkogins is not required for tetramer formation. this mobility is similar to the corresponding domain of psf <dig> of human gins, but different from the other corresponding domain of sld <dig> of human gins, which is required for stable tetramer formation. these differences imply that minor variations exist in the interactions with other dna metabolizing proteins, in terms of the atomic details. next, we built a reasonable model of the t. acidophilum gins homotetramer, which has a highly similar structure to those of the t. kodakaraensis and human gins crystal structures. taken together, these structural analyses suggest that the gins function is essentially conserved between archaea and human. considering this important viewpoint, an archaeal homolog of the eukaryotic cdc <dig> protein, which would participate in a replicative helicase complex similar to that of eukaryotes, could exist, although it has not been identified yet, presumably because of its highly divergent sequence. the present structure and the homology model of archaeal gins will provide a structural basis for clarification of the gins functions, including the formation of the cmg unwindosome complex.
