BACKGROUND
one of the emerging health problems in poor urban slum communities in developing countries is leptospirosis caused by pathogenic leptospira, which is the most widespread zoonotic disease <cit> .

the immune responses to leptospires appear complex. both animal model and human clinical studies have indicated that during the infection, leptospires can still persistently present despite robust immune responses suggesting that leptospires are capable of evading both innate and adaptive immunity and the immune responses triggered by leptospires in nature are not effective in the elimination of this pathogen  <cit> . accumulating evidence support a key role for cd4+ t cells in the acute and chronic stages of the infection in many bacterial diseases  <cit> . immunity is specific for leptospiral types that have closely related agglutinating antigens, that is, the same or closely related serovars  <cit> . at present, the full genome sequences of some leptospira strains have been sequenced  <cit> , but the target antigens which are important in the induction of the host immune responses during infection have not been fully identified.

leptospiral outer membrane proteins exposed on the leptospiral surface are conserved proteins among pathogenic leptospira and are potentially associated with pathogenesis, and have become a major focus of current leptospiral vaccine research  <cit> . some evidence has shown that outer membrane proteins play a critical role in the infection of leptospira, because these proteins are at the interface between the pathogen and the mammalian host immune responses  <cit> . ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> are antigenically conservative among pathogenic leptospira species; their promise as vaccine candidates is enhanced by the finding that ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> are expressed during infection of the mammalian host  <cit> . recombinant outer membrane proteins ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> were used as subunit vaccines and the protective effects were synergistic in a hamster model of leptospirosis  <cit> .

in the present study, we expressed selected combined t and b cell epitopes of ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> using a phage display system, and evaluated their ability of antibody recognition, as well as stimulation of t lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine expression.

identification of b cell epitopes
western blot assay was used to detect the reactivity of b cell epitope with antibodies in the rabbit sera raised against l. interrogans, rompl <dig> or rlipl <dig>  purified recombinant phage particles  were separated by electrophoresis in an 8% sds-page gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane . the membrane was blocked in 6% newborn bovine serum-tbst  for  <dig> h and incubated overnight at 4°c with rabbit serum against leptospira lai  followed by blotting with hrp-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies  for about  <dig> h at 37°c. blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and exposed to x-ray films. in some cases, the blots were reprobed using rabbit serum against rompl <dig> or rlipl <dig> after stripping off the first antibody by incubation in the stripping buffer . wild type m13ke particles were used as controls.

the reactivity of each epitope with antiserum mixture from igm- and igg-positive leptospirosis patients who were infected by different leptospiral serovars was also evaluated by western blot  <cit> . igm- and igg-positive serum samples from leptospire-infected humans were pooled together and used as primary antibody . the antisera were incubated with the pvdf membrane at 37°c for about  <dig>  h. after a washing step, goat anti-human igg-hrp  was used as secondary antibody. wild type m13ke particles were also used as controls.

mice and immunization
 <dig> μg rompl <dig> or rlipl <dig> protein pre-mixed with complete freund's adjuvant  was used to inject subcutaneously in the four limbs of 6- <dig> week old female balb/c  mice,. same dose of proteins for boosting immune responses were given with incomplete freund's adjuvant  two weeks later. after  <dig> days, the mice were used for further experiments. control mice were administered with pbs by the same procedures.

detection of t cell response
for the analysis of specific cd4+ t cell proliferation, spleens were aseptically removed and mechanically homogenized with a 3-ml syringe plunger, and then splenocytes were isolated by lymphocyte separation medium  according to the manufacturer's instruction. complete rpmi  <dig> media  was used to cultivate the cells.

 <dig> μl isolated t cells  and mitomycin-inactivated allogeneic splenocytes  were seeded into 96-well flat bottom culture plates and restimulated in vitro with different epitopes at a concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> recombinant phage particles per cell.  <dig> μg/ml mitogen concanavalin a  was used as control. cells were incubated at 37°c with 5% co <dig> for  <dig> h. the cell proliferation was measured using cell counting kit - <dig> according to the manufacturer's instruction. briefly,  <dig> μl cck solution was added to the culture medium and incubated for additional  <dig> h. the absorbance was determined at  <dig> nm with a  <dig> nm reference wavelength using elisa reader . unstimulated cells were used as negative control and cona-stimulated cells were used as positive control. tests were repeated at least three times independently. phages expressing each epitope were mixed together to evaluate if there is synergistic effect of these epitopes in the stimulation of the splenocytes isolated from the immunized mice.

effect of each epitope peptide on the secretion of cytokines
th <dig>  or th <dig>  cytokine secretion was examined. ifn-γ or il- <dig> elisa kit was used to evaluate the cytokine level in  <dig> μl t lymphocyte cell culture supernatants according to the manufacturer's instruction. production of each cytokine was calculated through the titration of the supplied calibrated cytokine standards.

RESULTS
prediction and expression of combined t and b cell epitopes of ompl <dig> and lipl41
the online softwares were used to map the combined b and t cell epitopes in ompl <dig> and lipl <dig>  eight high-score combined t and b cell epitopes, including  <dig> ompl <dig> epitopes and  <dig> lipl <dig> epitopes were selected as candidates for peptide expression and immunological analysis .

the residues possibly anchoring mhc ii molecular were underlined; the residues possibly binding b lymphocyte are bold.

each selected epitope of ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> was first amplified from genomic dna of lai strain , and then subcloned into the ecor <dig> i and kpn i sites of phage vector m13ke. the insertion of each epitope into the recombinant phage was confirmed by colony pcr . the sequences of the epitopes in the recombinant phage were confirmed via sequencing. then the recombinant phage dna was used to transform e. coli er <dig> competent cells. the recombinant phage particles were purified and separated on an 8% sds-page gel. wild type phage m13ke was used as control. as shown in figure 1a, after visualization by in-gel protein staining, there was a single band in each lane near 63- <dig> kd which was close to the molecular weight of m13ke  according to the protein ladder.

detection of b and t cell epitopes
b cell epitope was confirmed by western blot assay as described in the methods. as shown in figure 1b and 1c, all recombinant phages containing epitopes of ompl <dig> or lipl <dig> reacted with the serum against leptospire , rompl <dig> and rlipl <dig>  through quantitative analysis using quantity one  <dig> . <dig> software , we found that there were differences in the reactivity among the anti-sera of recombinant proteins and leptospire. the band representing ompl <dig> residues 173- <dig>  showed most significant reactivity with anti-rompl <dig> serum, and ompl1297- <dig> was more reactive than the rest two epitopes. all the four recombinant phages reacted with the anti-leptospire serum. phages containing ompl187- <dig> reacted most significantly. the reactivity of phages containing ompl159- <dig> and phages containing ompl1297- <dig> was close. when the phage particles were incubated with anti-rlipl <dig> serum, the reactivity of phages containing epitope lipl41181- <dig> or lipl41263- <dig> was more remarkable than phages containing the other two epitopes. when incubating with anti-leptospire serum, the reactivity of phages containing lipl41233- <dig> was the lowest comparing to the other three epitopes. five anti-leptospire sera from leptospire-infected humans were pooled together to test the reactivity against each b cell epitope. the result showed that epitope ompl187- <dig> reacted the strongest among the four ompl <dig> epitopes, and lipl41233- <dig> was the lowest among the four lipl <dig> epitopes .

t cell epitope was examined using proliferation assay of cd4+ t cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  in comparison with that from pbs control mice, splenocytes harvested from rompl1- or rlipl41-immunized mice proliferated vigorously upon stimulation with phages expressing epitope peptides of ompl <dig> or lipl <dig> 

haake and his coworkers  <cit>  previously reported that ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> exhibited synergistic immunoprotection in golden syrian hamster model. to determine if there are also synergistic interactions among the epitope peptides, phages expressing each peptide of ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> were pooled together and were used to stimulate the splenocytes. as shown in figure  <dig>  proliferation of splenocytes stimulated with the 8-epitope mixture  was more significant comparing to single-epitope phages or 4-epitope mixture of ompl <dig> or lipl <dig> alone .

evaluation of cytokine secretion in splenocytes induced by ompl1- or lipl41-derived epitopes
elisa assay was employed to determine the in vitro polarization of t helper cells. cells from both ompl1- and lipl41-immunized mice released large amount of ifn-γ but not il- <dig> comparing to cells from pbs control mice . ompl1173- <dig> epitope showed the strongest activity of stimulation, and other three ompl <dig> epitopes showed similar abilities in the stimulation of ifn-γ secretion. among the lipl <dig> epitopes, the secretion of ifn-γ in the cell cultures was induced by lipl41181- <dig>  lipl41233- <dig> and lipl41263- <dig> to the similar level; all of them were stronger than lipl4130- <dig>  when the  <dig> epitopes of ompl <dig> were pooled together to stimulate the splenocytes, the secretion of ifn-γ cytokine in the splenocyte supernatants was mildly increased. phages expressing each epitope of lipl <dig> failed to stimulate the secretion of ifn-γ or il- <dig> .

discussion
leptospira interrogans causes disease in both animals and humans throughout the world. leptospirosis in humans may be fatal due to the involvement of severe damage to multiple organs such as liver, lung, kidney and brain and is an increasing concern to the public health  <cit> .

l. interrogans can rapidly disseminate to multiple organs to induce programmed cell death  <cit> . the essential properties of a vaccine are safe, immunogenic, and effective in the prevention of leptospiral infection at both acute and carrier state. it has been a challenge to develop an effective and safe l. interrogans vaccine  <cit> . the currently available vaccines include multiple-valence inactivated leptospiral vaccine and subunit leptospiral vaccines  <cit> . however, these vaccines often have serious adverse effects  <cit> . and more importantly, most recombinant protein vaccines used against leptospira in animals are serovar-specific and therefore their efficacy is limited when leptospira of a different serovar is circulating  <cit> . the current emphasis in research laboratories is to discover conserved antigens that may induce long term protection across the species or serovars of leptospira. a better understanding of the mechanisms of the humoral as well as cell-mediated immune responses that are protective during leptospirosis of animals or human is critical to the development of a good leptospiral vaccine.

epitopes are small particular segments in antigen molecules which usually affect the antigenic specificity of the cellular and humoral immune responses. epitopes are attracting in the development of leptospiral vaccines, because it is convenient to make a seasonal vaccine by simply changing the formulations of the epitopes of relevant species. there are two types of epitopes of antigens, linear and conformational. a linear or a sequential epitope is an epitope that is recognized by the antibodies by its linear sequence of amino acids, and a conformational epitope is the sequences of subunits composing an antigen  that directly binds to a receptor of the immune system  <cit> . commonly, t cell epitopes are regulated by antigen presenting cells  to induce cellular immune response  <cit> . b cell epitopes including linear and conformational structure mostly induce humoral immune response  <cit> . multi-epitope peptide vaccine has become an attractive strategy in the development of vaccines against pathogens. usually, a good epitope vaccine contains both b cell and t cell epitopes.

in silico epitope prediction is a useful tool in the development of new vaccine formulations  <cit> . we set out to identify combined t and b cell epitopes of the leptospiral outer membrane proteins which are closely associated with leptospirosis. in silico epitope prediction led to the identification of four combined t and b cell epitopes of ompl <dig> and four combined t and b cell epitopes of lipl <dig>  respectively. the predicted epitopes were distributed along the entire protein sequence of each outer membrane protein. we compared the sequences of these epitopes to the sequences of  <dig> official chinese standard strains, and found that all the epitopes were identical to the corresponding regions of ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> of these different leptospira strains. to confirm b cell epitopes, we used phage display system and western blot analysis which were efficient methods in the study of b cell epitopes  <cit> . our result showed that these selected epitopes were specifically recognized by the antibodies in the rabbit sera against leptospira interrogans, rompl <dig> or lipl <dig> but the reactivity of each epitope to the antibodies was different. we speculate that this might be due to the interference of the recognition by the recombinant proteins still present in the sera. pathogenic microorganisms induce humoral immune responses during infection, which specifically responses to the antigens through specific interactions between the antibodies and the epitopes of the antigens  <cit> . recognition of the epitopes by antisera from immunized balb/c mice was confirmed, suggesting that these epitopes displayed by phages resemble the ones in the native antigen protein. in this study, we have shown that t and b cell combined epitopes of leptospiral outer membrane proteins ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> induced leptospire-specific immune responses, which suggests that these epitopes instead of entire proteins may be used to develop leptospiral vaccines.

cd4+ t lymphocytes play a critical role in the host immune responses during bacterial infection  <cit> . cd4+ t cells have been shown to differentiate into th <dig>  th <dig> and lately th <dig>  cells. th <dig> cells are characterized by their production of ifn-γ and are involved in cellular immunity  <cit> , and th <dig> cells produce il- <dig> and are required for humoral immunity  <cit> . in this experiment, the secretion of ifn-γ was more distinct than that of il- <dig> when the splenocytes were stimulated with the epitopes. we did not detect any significant secretion of il- <dig> in epitope-stimulated splenocyte cultures. it is possible that the levels of il- <dig> were below detection limit. the results implied that the selected epitopes were balb/c-specific th1-type epitope. immune protection against leptospires in mice is primarily correlated with th1-mediated immunity and ifn-γ secretion  <cit> . this result is consistent with our previous findings on leptospira antigens lipl <dig> and lipl <dig> proteins <cit> , suggesting that epitopes of outer membrane proteins  can induce strong cell-mediated immune response as well humoral immune responses. these epitopes may help us to investigate the role of th <dig> or th <dig> responses in the pathogenesis and immunity during leptospira interrogans infection.

CONCLUSIONS
the western blot data present here indicated that the combined t and b cells epitopes in outer membrane proteins of l. interrogans can be recognized by antibodies in the sera from leptospire-infected patients or rabbits immunized with recombinant proteins of outer membrane proteins. the data from t cell proliferation assay and cytokines secretion analysis showed that the selected epitopes can induce a th1- orientated response. the present study revealed that peptides ompl1173- <dig> of ompl <dig> and lipl41233- <dig> of lipl <dig> are both t cell and b cell epitopes which collaborate in the production of antibodies against leptospire and induction of lymphocyte differentiation. the identification of these immune dominant epitopes may greatly facilitate the development of novel leptospiral vaccines which may provide protections across different serogroups or serovars.
