BACKGROUND
ecstasy  is an amphetamine derivative widely abused for its euphoric and entactogenic effects in developed countries
 <cit> . the acute indirect monoaminergic agonist effects of mdma are mainly mediated by an increase in serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission of the brain by reversing transmembrane transporter functions, which are normally responsible for the uptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft
 <cit> . however, in the long-run, a decrease in serotonergic markers was reported in experimental animals and also in human users suggesting a long-term selective vulnerability of the serotonergic system
 <cit> . functional deficits could also be observed in humans and in rodents, e.g. impaired decision making, sleep disturbances, increased anxiety and impulsivity levels, elevated aggression, learning and memory impairments and depression
 <cit> . additionally to the selective damage observed in serotonergic neurons, mdma may also cause more wide-spread neurotoxicity, possibly by its hyperthermic effect and the production of toxic metabolites and free radicals or via the disruption of local cerebral blood flow and glucose utilization, which might cause alterations in the nutrition-supply of neurons
 <cit> .

the serotonergic projections in the mammalian brain, the primary targets of mdma’s effects in rats, originate from the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. dorsal  and medial raphe nuclei innervate upper brain structures, including the frontal cortical regions and the hippocampus 
 <cit> . the frontal cortex  plays major roles in risk evaluation
 <cit> , executive functioning
 <cit> , and working memory
 <cit> , while its malfunctions may be associated with neuropsychiatric diseases
 <cit> . at the same time, hc has a pivotal role in contextual and hereby spatial memory formation
 <cit>  thus all of the latter regions are candidates for long-run functional deficits caused by mdma.

parallel to the neuronal damage, however, neuroprotective mechanisms also occur and, later in time, recovery processes also may begin. heat-shock proteins  can ameliorate the damage caused by cellular stress of different origin, e.g. hyperthermia, ischemia, or excessive production of free radicals
 <cit> . elevated levels of hsp  <dig> in the fc and hc  <dig> days after mdma treatment was demonstrated by adori et al. and this elevation persisted until at least  <dig> days in the hc but normalized in the fc by this time
 <cit> . brain-derived neurotrophic factor , a well-characterized member of neurotrophic factors, is involved in several processes maintaining central nervous system  functions like dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis and activity-dependent potentiation . a study elucidating mdma’s effects on bdnf mrna expression reported ever increasing elevations in fc up to  <dig> days after mdma administration while in the hc a decrease was evident
 <cit> . investigation of mdma’s long-term effects revealed that in the parietal cortex bdnf protein levels peaked at  <dig> weeks after an initial decline but in the hc no significant change could be reported
 <cit> . all of the latter results suggest different recovery capacities of the hc and fc, but the detailed biochemical mechanisms responsible for these differences remained so far less investigated at later time points. we speculated that these consequences might be already visible at  <dig> days following a single dose of mdma thus we performed our analysis  <dig> weeks after drug administration to investigate both the recovery processes and the downstream mediators of damages.

studies examining transcriptional changes following mdma administration are scarce, only few reports evaluated alterations in mrna levels of genes which were assumed to be related to mdma effects
 <cit> .

thus, the aim of this study was to address the downstream transcriptional consequences of mdma’s effects and to find possible new targets of regulatory mechanisms by using large-scale gene expression profiling in the hc, fc, and dr regions of da rats  <dig> days after a single-dose mdma administration. additionally, we also addressed whether signs of functional recovery on the molecular level can occur in the fc and hc regions and if so, whether they differ in quality or quantity in these two regions. furthermore, for comparable results with our earlier studies, we used the same dosage regimen  in the dark agouti  rat strain, which represents the human "poor metabolizer" phenotype
 <cit> .

frontal cortex
differentially expressed genes
mdma caused a significant underexpression of genes related to the calcium signaling pathways  and the ionotropic glutamate receptor, nmda2b . the alpha subunit of the heat shock protein  <dig>  and the heat shock factor  <dig>  were upregulated, similarly to the high-affinity glial glutamate transporter  .

3: table s <dig> 

heatmap analysis
the heatmap  shows genes after two-way hierarchical clustering comparing their expression levels among all three regions. it provides a different insight into the transcriptional changes after mdma treatment. in the hc region nearly all of the genes were downregulated. in contrast, most of those genes that were downregulated in the fc were found to be upregulated in the hc, suggesting marked differences between the two regions. changes in the dr were scant independently of alterations in the other two regions.

discussion
in this study we evaluated the transcriptional consequences three weeks after a single neurotoxic dose of mdma in da rats with gene expression arrays. mdma’s effects on the transcriptional level suggest alterations in cognition and memory related processes with the possible involvement of the cb <dig> and ephrin receptors in the hc. on the other hand, fc region exhibits more wide-scale changes in basic catabolic processes within fc cells and the upregulation of the 'dendrite development’ , 'regulation of synaptic plasticity’ and 'positive regulation of synapse assembly’ gene sets suggest a partial new synapse formation/synaptic reorganization in this region. these differences between the hc and fc indicate markedly different transcriptional responses of these two brain regions three weeks after a single dose mdma administration.

hippocampus
in the hc we observed an upregulation of cb <dig> receptor mrna. nawata et al. also investigated cb <dig> receptor mrna levels in the hc regions of mice up to  <dig> days following the cessation from repeated mdma administration and they reported an increase  <dig> days, but not  <dig> day after the last treatment
 <cit> . our study shows that an increase of cb <dig> receptor levels can be caused even by a single-dose of mdma and can be detected three weeks after the drug administration in rats. the presence of elevated cb <dig> receptor mrna levels in both rats and mice, which have markedly different reactions to mdma on the long-run
 <cit> , raises the possibility of such effects in human ecstasy users alike.

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  treatment is known to cause alterations in cb <dig> receptor levels in the hc
 <cit>  and these alterations might be the consequences of the altered serotonergic tone. activation of serotonin 2c  receptors increases endocannabinoid production in the postsynaptic hc and amygdala neurons via the downstream activation of diacylglycerol  lipase
 <cit> . the released 2-arachidonoil glycerol  acts on the presynaptic neurons, and inhibits serotonin  release through cb <dig> receptor activation thus forming a negative feedback loop
 <cit> . mdma treatment leads to a long-term serotonergic deficiency and to the damage of serotonergic axon terminals
 <cit> . hence, the result of the decreased endocannabinoid release from postsynaptic neurons might result in the observed upregulation of the cb <dig> receptor.

cannabinoid agonists impair working memory and short term memory
 <cit>  and it has been also reported that mdma can cause impairments in cognitive functions in humans, rats and mice
 <cit> . nawata et al. also showed that cb <dig> receptor antagonist attenuated the mdma-induced cognitive deficit in mice
 <cit> . accordingly, we observed in the present study that genes involved in the regulation of memory and cognitive processes were downregulated after mdma treatment in da rats. the latter findings and the fact that both cb <dig> receptor elevations and cognitive deficits are present in multiple species suggest a central role of cb <dig> receptor and thus cannabinoid signaling in the reduced cognitive and memory functions following mdma administration.

cb <dig> receptors exert their effects in the cells via calcium-signaling, thus upregulation of some of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases , calcium transporters, an inositol transporter and the phosphorylation gene set may be in association with cb <dig> receptor signaling. in addition, enhancement in cannabinoid signaling usually indirectly reduces glutamate release by acting on gaba-ergic interneurons in the hc . accordingly, genes belonging to the regulation of the glutamatergic synaptic transmission were downregulated in the present study. finally, elevated cb <dig> receptor signaling has been shown to impair neurite growth and arborization in developing rodent brain and cannabinoid agents in adult mice were able to modulate synaptic plasticity
 <cit> . in accordance, we also observed downregulations in 'neuron projection development’ and synaptic plasticity related gene sets.

here we also show upregulations of the mrna levels of epha <dig>  epha <dig> and epha <dig> receptors in the hc after mdma administration. these receptors have been reported to modulate synapse formation and glutamatergic long-term potentiation  . since ephrin receptors are bidirectional receptors and regulate both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, the up- or downregulation of these receptors does not result in consequent elevation or suppression of synapse formation. instead, a proper level of these receptors is required for accurate neuronal projection termination
 <cit> . while epha <dig> and epha <dig> are widely expressed in the hc, epha <dig> is weakly labeled in this region under physiological conditions
 <cit> . epha <dig> was found to suppress synapse development in the hc
 <cit> , while epha <dig> knock-out  mice showed decreased spine density in other brain regions
 <cit>  and may be necessary for proper hippocampal projections
 <cit> . in another study, epha <dig> ko mice showed impaired cognitive functions
 <cit> . thus, it is clear that ephrin receptors modulate synapse formation in the hc and related cognitive functions.

frontal cortex
while alterations in the expression of 5-ht markers are well-defined, studies examining other effects of mdma on gene expression are scarce. thiriet et al. examined  <dig>  toxicology-related genes in adult sprague–dawley rats and followed expression patterns up to  <dig> days after a 20 mg/kg single-dose mdma administration in the fc
 <cit> . they found nerve growth factor alterations and suggested cytoskeletal reorganization while in another study by fernandez-castillo et al. emphasized neuroinflammatory responses in mdma-effects  <dig> hours after repeated-administration in adult mice
 <cit> . martinez-turillas et al. investigated brain-derived neurotrophic factor augmentations in the fc region of wistar rats up to  <dig> days after drug administration
 <cit> . in our present study we examined the gene expression patterns longer time  after a single neurotoxic dose of mdma in the vulnerable da rat strain. we report wide-scale downregulation of genes involved in chromatin organization, nucleocytoplasmic transport, ribosome-related functions, protein synthesis/folding and transmembrane transport processes in the fc region . it seems reasonable that the observed changes are the long-term consequence of the acute general neurotoxic processes, like toxic metabolite formation, hyperthermic effect or free radical production or the impairment in the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow
 <cit> . the latter is even further supported by the upregulation of the response to hyperoxia gene set in the present study. we could not confirm neuroinflammatory changes
 <cit>  or bdnf dysregulation
 <cit>  observed by other authors in our experimental setup. in comparison with the previous study of thiriet et al.
 <cit> , the growth factor activity gene set was upregulated, while some gene sets, related to neuronal cytoskeletal transport were downregulated in line with the previous study. however, this similarity existed only on the level of the mentioned biological processes, and was a result of the dysregulation of other genes, a possible result of the differences in the strain, time-scale and dosage regimen between the two studies.

motor regions in the fc are targets of thalamical inputs and contribute to motor system functions
 <cit> . studies in da rats with the same mdma administration protocol like in the recent experiment indicated chronic changes in motor activity
 <cit> . additionally, karageorgiou et al. reported alterations in right supplementary motor area activation in human mdma users in an fmri study
 <cit> . these results might reflect subsequent impairments in motor functions on the long-run and are in accordance with the observed wide-scale changes in the recent experiment.

as from another functional perspective fc and prefrontal cortical regions  are not only responsible for motor functions, but are also closely related to different cognitive tasks, e.g. working memory, goal-directed behavior, and executive functioning in rats
 <cit> . in our experiment fc samples contained regions from primary and secondary  motor cortices principally and likely some parts of the pfc
 <cit> . thus the inhibition of certain biosynthetic processes found in the present study may even participate in the cognitive decline of heavy mdma users.

at the same time, however, upregulation of neurite formation related gene sets and thus a partial reinstatement of fc networks is also suggested by our present data. additionally, the upregulation of hsp-related genes in the present study also suggests different extent in recovery processes. the latter results and the lack of similar processes in the hc might point out to different severity of damage of different memory types. indeed, the only study investigating such differences following binge administration of mdma, reported rats learning working-memory related tasks  faster on the long-run compared to spatial reference memory  in an 8-arm radial maze challenge
 <cit> .

taken together, the downregulation of almost  <dig> gene sets related to biosynthetic processes in the fc may reflect transcriptional adaptations to well-known general neurotoxic effects not related to specific pathways  <dig> weeks after the drug administration. at the same time, the upregulation of the gene sets responsible for synapse/dendrite formation in this brain region may point to a starting new synapse formation/synaptic reorganization and might be a sign of a compensatory mechanism ameliorating mdma’s acute effects  <dig> weeks after the administration.

dorsal raphe
the changes in the dr region were mild in line with our previous results suggesting that mdma-caused damage to these neurons are restricted to serotonergic axon terminals instead of neuronal cell bodies directly
 <cit> . the caspase activation gene set significantly changed in the present study was not supported by individual genes, or other gene sets related to apoptotical processes. the downregulation in 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  <dig> mrna levels might suggest a possible role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in mdma’s long-term consequences, an effect also proposed by others
 <cit> . however, the dr region seems to be mostly unaffected  <dig> weeks after a single-dose of mdma administration in da rats.

limitations
in the present study we have not elucidated the temporal patterns of the mrnas. further studies are needed addressing the time course of the described alterations to elicit the causative relations of these transcriptional processes in details.

we could not confirm the decreased expression of serotonergic markers in the present study. both 5-htt and tph mrna levels were unaltered in the treatment group, which is in conflict with previous results: well established prolonged serotonergic depletion and decreased expression of serotonergic markers in both protein and mrna levels after mdma-treatment were demonstrated by our group earlier
 <cit> . here we can assume that the collection of dr samples was not precise enough and as we did not apply laser capture microdissection in this case, significant amount of surrounding tissue was perhaps cut out together with the dr and it may result a bias in the measurement of serotonergic markers. notably, the decrease of 5-htt expression, measured by quantitative in situ hybridization, was approximately -20% in the same animal model  <dig> weeks after the mdma treatment, compared to the control level, and this moderate alteration was significant only in case of the fine measurement of grain densities of individual cells but not with the measuring of the autoradiography signal on film
 <cit> .

on the other hand, microarray method has well-known drawbacks, when compared to polymerase chain reaction methods or immunohistochemistry used in our earlier papers. namely, the limited amount of probes on the microarray may result in smaller fold change values, when compared to polymerase chain reaction methods , which can also be noticed on figure 
 <dig>  on the other hand, the shorter oligomers used can result in more mismatch hybridization, which can overcome smaller changes in gene expressions, like that in the case of 5-htt. however, for this very reason we assume that the results presented here, with our strict significance criterion, are robust enough to overcome this bias.

we did not find alterations in the bdnf gene expression, which is in agreement with our previous study where we demonstrated that  bdnf protein level was increased only  <dig> weeks after the same mdma dosage regimen in the same rat strain
 <cit> .

we must also note the major limitation of transcriptomic studies, namely, mrna levels do not necessarily reflect for the appropriate protein levels.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed a genome-wide evaluation of transcriptional changes  <dig> weeks after a single-dose of mdma in da rats. our results highlight cb <dig> and ephrin receptors as potential downstream mediators of mdma in the hc. in addition, gsea showed downregulation of the ‘cognition’ and ‘memory’ gene sets and also indicated a decreased functionality of long-term potentiation and the possible involvement of the hippocampal glutamatergic pathway in these processes. however, determination of causative relations or possible interactions between the observed changes requires further investigations.

on the other hand, the fc region showed markedly different changes. the differences compared to the hc were obvious by both the gsea and by the heatmap analysis. these differences may reflect for the different anatomical properties/connectivity and also the different neurotransmitter contents of these regions. the downregulated pathways in the fc were related to the basic mechanisms of the cell functionality in the absence of specific markers of certain pathways. in the fc the upregulation of the ‘dendrite development’, ‘regulation of synaptic plasticity’ and ‘positive regulation of synapse assembly’ gene sets raise the possibility of new synapse formation/synaptic reorganization mechanisms in this region. in contrast, these gene sets were not upregulated in the hc. all of these results point out to a starting reinstatement of the neuronal pathways and connections in the fc, but not in the hc, three weeks after a 15 mg/kg dose of mdma.
