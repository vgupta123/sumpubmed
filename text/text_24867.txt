BACKGROUND
the ability to signal and repair dna damage is essential to any cell and requires many pathways. among these pathways, recombination processes constitute an important set of systems acting in the repair of dna breaks and of stalled/collapsed replication forks  <cit> . besides the ubiquitous recombinase , the highly conserved rad <dig> and mre <dig> proteins must play important roles in these processes even if their precise function is still unclear. in bacteria, these proteins, known as sbcc and sbcd respectively, are involved in the elimination of palindromes in the course of dna replication and in the repair of double strand breaks , inter-strand dna cross links and collapsed replication forks  <cit> . in eucarya, rad <dig> and mre <dig> proteins are associated with a third eucaryal-specific partner, xrs <dig> in yeast, nbs <dig> in human, and play a key role in a surprising large range of pathways: the repair of dsbs by homologous recombination and, at least in saccharomyces cerevisiae, non-homologous-end-joining, the repair of collapsed replication forks, dna damage cell checkpoint, the maintenance of telomeres, and the generation  as well as the resection of meiotic dsbs  <cit> . in archaea, rad <dig> and mre <dig> homologs have been found in all species  <cit>  and characterization of recombinant proteins from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon pyrococcus furiosus showed that they form a tight complex exhibiting activities similar to their bacterial and eucaryal counterparts  <cit> . however, the role of these proteins in vivo is presently unknown.

in eucarya, rad <dig> and mre <dig> proteins were shown to act at the initiation step of homologous recombination in the resection of broken dna ends in 3' dna tails required for recombinase loading and strand exchange, but their precise role in this process is still unclear  <cit> . in bacteria, this step is primarily performed via the recbcd and the recq/recfor/recj pathways  <cit> . in both cases, initiation processes are well understood and emphasize the implication of helicases and 5' to 3' nucleases. the rad <dig> and mre <dig> proteins form a tight complex that exhibits single-strand endonuclease and 3'-5' exonuclease activities relevant to the phosphoesterase mre <dig>  <cit>  together with a mechanical function inherent to rad <dig>  this protein, related to smc proteins , might be involved in the tethering of broken dna molecules  <cit> . however, the activities associated with the rad50-mre <dig> complex even in the presence of xrs2/nbs <dig>  do not explain how dna ends are processed into 3' overhangs, suggesting the involvement of additional partners  <cit> .

we found previously that in most hyperthermophilic archaea, rad50-mre <dig> genes are clustered with two unknown genes that we called nura and hera and that the four genes are co-transcribed in the crenarchaeon sulfolobus acidocaldarius  <cit> . we characterized recombinant proteins from s. acidocaldarius and showed that nura defines a new nuclease family exhibiting both a single-strand endonuclease activity and a 5' to 3' exonuclease activity on single and double-strand dna  <cit> , and that hera is the prototype of a novel dna helicase family and exhibits the striking property to unwind the dna helix from both a 3' and a 5' single-strand overhang  that bind to dna ends of each dna strand and increase the processivity of the entire complex  <cit> . the bipolar helicase hera might play such a role except that both helicase activities reside in the same protein.

many hyperthermophilic archaeal species are highly resistant to gamma rays and repair fragmented chromosomes efficiently using pathways that have not been clearly established and that appear to be mostly constitutive  <cit> . as powerful genetic tools for hyperthermophilic archaea are just emerging, we took an immuno-detection approach to investigate the potential roles of the rad <dig>  mre <dig>  nura and hera proteins in post-irradiation dna repair in s. acidocaldarius. we analyzed the levels and sub-cellular partitioning of rad <dig>  mre <dig>  nura and hera along with the rada recombinase in mock-treated and irradiated cells and we checked for the interactions between this set of proteins. our main results show that 1) all proteins are synthesized in exponentially growing cultures and show constant levels, 2) all proteins display different sub-cellular partitioning 3) rad <dig>  mre <dig> and hera interact altogether in a constitutive way and 4) after gamma irradiation, both mre <dig> and rada are recruited immediately to chromosomal dna and remain dna bound in the course of dna repair. these data provide the first evidence supporting the involvement of mre <dig> in dna repair processes in the archaea and showing the interaction between rad <dig>  mre <dig> and the hera bipolar dna helicase.

RESULTS
irradiation of s. acidocaldarius cells, chromosome fragmentation and subsequent dna repair
we first determined the dose of gamma irradiation that does not lead to massive cell death but induces chromosome fragmentation and subsequent repair. s. acidocaldarius was previously shown to be as radiosensitive as e. coli under aerobic conditions  <cit> . as oxygen is known to dramatically increase radio-sensitivity  <cit> , we compared the survival rates of s. acidocaldarius irradiated under aerobic or limited-aerobic conditions. as shown in fig 1a, the radioresistance is higher under limited-aerobic conditions, with more than  <dig> % of cells alive after exposure to  <dig> gray of radiation. in order to verify that the  <dig> gray irradiation has induced dna fragmentation and to determine the timing of repair, we performed a time course analysis of the dna content of the irradiated cells. immediately after the irradiation, cells were re-inoculated into fresh medium and further grown up to the stationary phase. aliquots of post-irradiated cultures were harvested after different times  and chromosomal dna was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . whereas the survival rate determined by cells plating immediately after the  <dig> gray irradiation and corresponding to time  <dig> is about  <dig> %, chromosomal dna analysis shows that irradiated cells have sustained high levels of chromosome fragmentation . this indicates that a majority of the damaged cells has eventually recovered and resumed growth. furthermore, the time course analysis shows that chromosomal dna was restored in  <dig> h.

analyses of rad <dig>  mre <dig>  hera, nura and rada protein levels and partitioning
concomitantly to dna analysis, we performed a time course study  of the amount and the partitioning of each protein between chromosomal-enriched and soluble fractions both in non-irradiated and  <dig> gray irradiated cells. cell fractionations were performed by gentle lysis with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> and low-speed centrifugation through sorbitol allowing the recovery of more than  <dig> % of total dna in pellet fractions as shown in the next section. total, pellet and supernatant fractions from three independent experiments were analyzed in triplicate by western blotting with specific antibodies raised against each protein, and control cultures were submitted to exactly the same procedure without irradiation in order to rule out the effects of cell manipulation. loading controls were performed using antibodies raised against s. acidocaldarius dna ligase for which no variation was previously detected . as the dna-bound portion of the ligase is very weak, we also utilized this protein as an internal control of cell lysis and fractionation. furthermore, the reliability of these studies was ensured by the immunodetection of four proteins together with the dna ligase on the same blot.

rad <dig>  mre <dig>  hera, nura and rada proteins display different sub-cellular partitioning
we first examined protein patterns in non-irradiated cells . all proteins showed a constant level up to  <dig> h of growth . in cells from stationary phase cultures , the amount of rad <dig> and mre <dig> proteins decreased significantly whereas hera, nura and rada protein levels remained in the same range. with the exception of the nura protein, which was only detected in supernatant, a significant portion of all other proteins were recovered in pellet fractions. in order to confirm that these proteins were bound to dna, cell fractionation was applied on total extract  treated with dnase i. as shown in figures 2b and 2c, the dnase i treatment led to the disappearance of nearly all dna in pellet fractions and to a dramatic decrease of the amount of rad <dig>  hera, mre <dig> and rada. since we performed cell fractionation without any dna-protein fixation, this indicates a strong association with the chromosome. a statistic analysis of the dna-bound portion of the four proteins is shown in figure  <dig>  the protein that exhibited the highest percentage of dna-bound molecules was rad <dig>  showing that this smc-like protein is associated with dna constitutively. in the case of hera, the chromosomal-associated fraction increased along the time course, reaching about  <dig> % at  <dig> h, suggesting a progressive recruitment of hera to dna from the early exponential phase up to the stationary phase. the dna-bound portion of rada is less than  <dig> % except at time  <dig> for which a higher amount was observed. analysis of rada dna-bound fraction before cell manipulation indicated that growth arrest and cold shock induces this recruitment to dna . this phenomenon is also observed for the mre <dig> protein.

the mre <dig> protein and the rada recombinase are recruited to chromosomal dna following gamma irradiation
comparative analyses of protein patterns from mock treated and irradiated cells  show that concomitantly to the irradiation  and up to seven hours of post-irradiation growth, the dna bound fractions of both mre <dig> and rada increased significantly, indicating that both proteins were recruited to dna which suggests their involvement in post-irradiation dna repair. in total extracts, we observed a slight but reproducible increase of hera levels at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of post-irradiation growth, suggesting that hera synthesis might be slightly up-regulated. we also noticed that at  <dig> h, the amount of both rad <dig> and mre <dig> proteins in total extracts of irradiated cells showed a smaller decrease compared to the decrease observed in control cells, and that this phenomenon was also observed in soluble fractions. this difference might indicate that some un-repaired dna lesions lead to the maintenance of rad <dig> and mre <dig> synthesis or to their protection against protein degradation processes.

the hera bipolar helicase interacts with the rad50-mre <dig> complex both in vivo and in vitro
in order to check potential interactions between rad <dig>  mre <dig>  hera, nura and rada proteins, we performed immuno-precipitation assays using total extracts of exponentially growing sulfolobus cells. as shown in fig. 4a, both mre <dig> and hera were co-precipitated together with rad <dig> by anti-rad <dig> antibodies, whereas neither nura nor rada were recovered. the same result was obtained using either post-irradiated or non-irradiated cell extracts indicating that rad <dig>  mre <dig> and hera dependent complexes are formed constitutively in s. acidocaldarius. immuno-precipitation assays were also performed using soluble fractions and chromosomal-enriched fractions previously treated with dnase i. in both cases, the rad <dig>  mre <dig> and hera proteins were recovered indicating that dna is not required for the formation of these complexes. in order to determine if the interaction between rad <dig>  mre <dig> and hera required other protein partners, immuno-precipitation assays were performed on a mixture of purified rad <dig>  mre <dig>  hera and nura recombinant proteins. as shown in fig. 4b, rad <dig>  mre <dig> and hera proteins were co-precipitated by anti-rad <dig> antibodies indicating a direct interaction between the three proteins.

discussion
in this report, we first showed that rad <dig>  mre <dig>  nura, hera and the rada recombinase are synthesized in exponentially growing s. acidocaldarius cells and display constant levels. whereas all proteins exhibit different sub-cellular partitioning, we detected soluble protein complexes including rad <dig>  mre <dig> and the hera bipolar helicase. these results indicate that each protein might play specific roles in addition to its function when combined with its partners. indeed, the smc-like rad <dig> protein shows the highest level of chromosomal-bound fraction suggesting a constitutive role on dna. concomitantly to gamma irradiation and chromosome fragmentation, we observed that a significant portion of mre <dig> protein is recruited to dna  and is still dna-bound in the course of dna repair. this result strongly suggests that the mre <dig> nuclease is actively involved in dna repair processes and/or act as a dna damage sensor. as previously described for other archaeal species  <cit> , gamma irradiation does not lead to the increase of rada levels. however, rada is immediately recruited to dna which indicates that dna damaged products exhibiting single-strand portions such as 3' single-strand overhangs, gapped dna or stalled replication forks might be recognized by the recombinase and/or that rada also acts as a dna damage sensor. for both rada and mre <dig> proteins, the recruitment to dna is also observed to a weaker extent in control cells concomitantly to cold shock, growth arrest and consequently the arrest of dna replication. this finding suggests a role of mre <dig> and rada in the signaling and/or the repair of stalled replication forks.

gamma irradiation did not lead to dramatic variations of rad <dig>  mre <dig>  hera or nura total levels. however, the slight increase of hera at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of post-irradiation growth, the persistence of higher levels of both rad <dig> and mre <dig> at  <dig> h, and the physical interaction between rad <dig>  mre <dig> and the hera helicase support the involvement of the three proteins in dna repair and suggest fine regulations of this pathway. no protein interaction was found with the nura nuclease. either this nuclease exhibits no or weak protein interactions with rad <dig>  mre <dig> and/or hera, or a competition for binding site accessibility prevents the recovery of nura in our immunoprecipitation assays since the antibodies were raised against protein peptides. none of these proteins appears to display tight interactions with the rada recombinase since, in that case, immunoprecipitation assays performed with antibodies raised against the whole rada protein did not allow the recovery of any of the other proteins .

to date, dna helicases that have been shown to functionally interact with the rad50-mre <dig> complex correspond to eukaryotic recq-like enzymes involved in checkpoint activation and in the resolution of dna structure intermediates in the course of dna recombination/repair processes  <cit> . however, it has been recently shown in xenopus laevis, that the wrn  recq-like helicase also acts at the initiation step of homologous recombination in the unwinding of broken dna ends  <cit> . archaea lack any recq homolog but might harbor several functional analogs that could play specific or overlapping functions as in eucarya. indeed, in hyperthermophilic archaea, two helicases acting in the repair of stalled replication forks have been characterized, the hjm/hel308a helicase specific for branched dna species  <cit> , and hef, a composite helicase/endonuclease protein  <cit> . the hera helicase might also correspond to one of these recq analogs and could be primarily involved at the initiation step of homologous recombination in concert with the rad50-mre <dig> complex and the nura nuclease. intriguingly, we found that the dna-bound fraction of hera progressively increases along culture growth in both control and irradiated cells. recently, lundgren and bernander analyzed cell-cycle genes expression in s. acidocaldarius  <cit> . analysis of these data shows that hera expression is induced at first in s phase as it is the case for several dna repair genes such as rada, while a second induction of hera is observed at the s/g <dig> transition. these findings suggest that in addition to its functions in dna repair, hera could be involved in chromosome segregation processes. we previously showed that hera is the prototype of a novel helicase family distantly related to a ntpases family involved in dna transport processes such as trwb implicated in dna conjugation, vird <dig> implicated in dna translocation from bacteria to plant cells or ftsk involved in dna pumping during bacterial cell division  <cit> . as no true ftsk homolog is found in archaea, iyer et al. have thus suggested that hera could be the ftsk counterpart and could act as a dna translocase in the course of chromosome segregation  <cit> . considering the helicase activities associated with hera  <cit> , hera cell-cycle expression  <cit> , and our present data, another hypothesis on the potential role of hera in chromosome segregation processes could be that this helicase helps the correct segregation of newly replicated chromosomes as previously shown for the s. cerevisiae recq-like helicase sgs <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the rad <dig> and mre <dig> proteins have been conserved throughout the course of evolution. our results provide the first in vivo data supporting the implication of the mre <dig> protein in dna repair processes in the archaea and showing its physical interaction with rad <dig> and the archaeal-specific hera bipolar helicase. moreover, they suggest that each protein might play several roles. our current in vitro studies on the specificities and functional interactions between these proteins, the nura nuclease and the rada recombinase, combined to genetic analyses, should help define the roles and the mechanisms of action of these key proteins.
