BACKGROUND
transfer rna  is the adapter molecule mainly responsible for decoding mrna into the corresponding peptide sequence. trna molecules are generally 75- <dig> nucleotides long and form clover-leaf shaped structures through base pairing in the acceptor stem; d-stem, tΨc stem and anticodon stem . modified trna nucleosides are found universally in living organisms. some are conserved across all domains of life , indicating an evolutionary ancient enzyme  <cit> . according to the rna modification database http://library.med.utah.edu/rnamods/,  <dig> different modified nucleosides were found in rna as at  <dig>  among these,  <dig> are present on trna molecules. all modified nucleosides are derivatives of the four normal nucleosides: adenosine, guanosine, uracine and cytosine. the modifications vary from a simple methylation on the ribose or base moiety to complicated side chain modifications in different positions of the purine/pyramidine ring .

all nucleoside modifications except q are made on the polynucleotide level, i.e. they are made post-transcriptionally  <cit> . many variations exist, however, in the regulation of modifications. for example, some eukaryotic trna modifications require intron-containing trna. also, the modification of trnas can differ depending on the intracellular compartment, e.g. using yeast phe-trna as a substrate in phaseolus vulgaris, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes had m5c modification activity whereas chloroplast enzymes had m1a modification activity  <cit> . modification pathways vary from a single methylation to complicated pathways involving multiple protein complexes, e.g. at least  <dig> gene products have been found to be involved in mcm5s2u modification in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in e. coli, no modified nucleosides were shown to be essential for viability, however, the lack of certain modifying enzymes can lead to lethality  <cit> . in s.cerevisiae, three trna modifying enzymes  that modify m1a <dig>  <cit> , i <dig>  <cit>  and trnahis g- <dig>   <cit>  are known to be essential. modified nucleosides influence the coding capacity of trna by strengthening or weakening anticodon-codon interactions and by influencing codon choice and codon context sensitivity. deficiency of modified nucleosides can, therefore, lead to reduced translation efficiency and increased translation errors, which will affect gene expression regulation and cell metabolism  <cit> . growth conditions and the environment can affect trna modifications both quantitatively and qualitatively, e.g. bacteria growing under starvation conditions for certain amino acids or iron leads to under-modification of trna  <cit> . the link between the synthesis of modified nucleosides in trna and metabolism has been suggested to be a regulatory device and trna modification as a "biological sensor". studies in wheat have shown chromatographic changes of aminoacylated-trnas in different developmental stages  <cit>  and an increase of phe-trna y modification in older leaf tissues than in young leaf tissues  <cit> . studies of different tissue types of tobacco showed that the abundance and variety of methylated nucleosides are greater in intact plants than in habituated and tumorous tissues  <cit> . trna modifications also differ upon maturation and/or transport into subcellular compartments such as mitochondria  <cit>  or chloroplasts. finally, some trna modifications require the presence of introns  <cit> . clearly, therefore, which modified nucleosides are present on mature trna depends on when and where the modification occurs on the trna molecule.

nucleoside modifications of trna have been extensively studied in bacteria and yeast and most of the biochemical pathways and genes encoding modification enzymes have been identified. by contrast, the study of trna modified nucleosides in plants has rarely been documented. as a result of their key role in the translation machinery, the mechanisms of regulation of trna activity by modified nucleosides are quite well-conserved. some modified nucleosides are universally found in trnas from organisms of different domains of life, presumably because of their essential role for the structural stability of trna interactions with partner molecules during translation. in bacteria and s. cerevisiae trna, trna modifications have been suggested to act as biological sensors, changing quantity and quality according to the growth conditions. plants encounter great environmental changes throughout their life cycles. this begs the question; do modified nucleosides change at different developmental stages, in different plant tissues or in response to environmental stimuli? how many modified nucleosides exist in plants, and how are they synthesized? these are the questions we want to investigate in order to understand the function of modified nucleotides in plant development. we chose arabidopsis thaliana and hybrid aspen  for the study because both the arabidopsis and the hybrid aspen genomes have been fully sequenced and because pools of mutants exist for arabidopsis, facilitating the identification of genes for specific modified nucleosides. in addition, transgenic methods for both arabidopsis and aspen are well-established. hybrid aspen complements arabidopsis because it is a perennial plant and therefore more suitable for study wood formation.

the methods used for rna extraction and subsequent purification separate small rnas  from high molecular weight rna molecules . snrna  are extensively modified post-transcriptionally mainly by 2'-o-methylation and pseudouradylation at multiple positions. modification in u <dig> snrna from yeast and mammals have been shown to be important for the assembly and function of spliceosomes  <cit> . 2'-o-methylation of u <dig> snrna has been shown to be conserved in plants but different from yeast and animals. the sequences of snorna which guide u <dig> snrna modification by complementary sequences were also shown to be different between rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . plants have hundreds of mirna genes and the abundance of mirna might exceed trna under specific conditions . a considerable number of modifications  are known to exist in plant mirna  <cit> . the presence of modified nucleosides in plant trna is well accepted but modifying enzymes in plants has rarely been documented. one example of a modifying enzyme is the abo1/elo <dig> gene. mutations in this gene, encoding a homolog of the yeast elongator complex protein, elp <dig>  can increase abscisic acid sensitivity and drought tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . there are very few plant trna sequences available  <cit>  for the identification of modified nucleosides on different positions of individual trna species, and very few plant trna modifying enzymes have been purified  <cit>  or identified  <cit> .

in this study we established a method for trna purification for the analysis of modified nucleosides in arabidopsis and hybrid aspen . twenty one known and four novel modified nucleosides were detected in comparison with modified nucleosides found in other organisms. a combination-bioinformatics study and loss-of-function approach in arabidopsis was used to identify five genes involved in modification of four specific modified nucleosides: m1g, m2g, m7g and ncm5u.

RESULTS
 <dig> modified nucleosides and  <dig> novel nucleosides were detected in trnas of arabidopsis thaliana and hybrid aspen
the model plants, arabidopsis thaliana and hybrid aspen  were chosen for trna isolation and hplc analysis. because of the low yield of trna from plant tissues from previous experience, we used young seedlings of arabidopsis and young leaves and shoot apices from hybrid aspen due to higher abundance of rna in tissues of early developmental stages. from  <dig> g frozen tissue we were able to obtain approximately  <dig> mg total rna using trizol reagent. after removal of rrna and mrna by licl method we routinely obtained about  <dig> μg small rna. from the last step of de <dig> column purification about 40- <dig> μg trna were used for degradation and subsequent hplc analysis. gradient buffers consisting of three buffers were used to separate modified nucleosides and the elution time and spectrum of each peak were used to identify different modified nucleosides.

twenty-one modified nucleosides were detected in arabidopsis and hybrid aspen, listed according to the order of elution time from c <dig> column of hplc analysis in table  <dig>  hplc chromatograms of the two species were very similar ; all modified nucleosides present in arabidopsis were also present in hybrid aspen, with only slight differences for the relative abundance of some peaks. dihydrouridine  is difficult to detect because it elutes together with Ψ, however d is well conserved and is the second most widely distributed modified nucleoside, therefore it should be present in plant trnas. q was not analyzed because it is destroyed during the procedure used for trna extraction and digestion in this study. q is present in e. coli and mammalian trna but absent in yeast trna <cit> . because the tgt gene responsible for q biosynthesis is found in p. trichocarpa but not in a. thaliana, q should be present in trna from hybrid aspen but absent in arabidopsis. we compared the chromatogram with that from s. cerevisiae, calf liver and e. coli , certain prokaryotic trna modifications  were not found in plants, however m2a and ms2io6a which is present in bacteria but not in yeast and calf liver, was found in arabidopsis and hybrid aspen trnas . we also observed differences in trna modifications between plants, s. cerevisiae and calf liver. m3c and i6a are present in yeast trna but were not found in arabidopsis and hybrid aspen. genes for m3c modification were not identified. several modified nucleosides ) that were detected using purified single trna species from s. cerevisiae were not detected in this study. it is difficult to conclude whether these modified nucleosides were absent or of extremely low abundance. wybutosine  derivatives were not detected either, however, arabidopsis genes involved in y synthesis  have been proposed  <cit> .

a. nucleosides are listed in the order of retention time in hplc chromatogram, threshold for detection is approximately  <dig> % of total area in hplc chromatogram, any modified nucleoside below this threshold is designated as "-".

b. d  is not easily detected in hplc system because of the very early retention time and because of its close elution with Ψ.

c. mcm5u is detected in yeast single trna prep but not in bulk trna preps.

d. ar is present on initiator trna in s. cerevisiae , its position in hplc is unknown.

e. ncm5um is detected in yeast single trna prep , its position in hplc is unknown.

f. e. coli has ms2i6a but salmonella enterica has ms2io6a.

g. q is not being analyzed because it is destroyed during trna extraction and digestion.

n.a. data not available.

to summarize, four u derivatives, nine a derivatives, three c derivatives and five g derivatives were detected in a total of  <dig> modified nucleosides from arabidopsis and hybrid aspen trnas. four novel modified nucleosides were detected  and the identity of these plant-specific modified nucleosides requires further experimentation.

using bioinformatics to find trna modifying genes in plants
many genes for trna modifying enzymes have been identified in yeast and bacteria . we decided to look for trna modification genes by homology-based bioinformatics approaches  <cit> . we used protein sequences from s. cerevisiae or e. coli genes for the modified nucleosides detected in this study to find plant gene homologs from tair  and ncbi databases http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. homologous genes are listed in table  <dig> according to the order of modified nucleosides eluted from a c <dig> column from hplc analysis. phylogenetic trees for each family of genes were constructed using geneious basic  <dig> . <dig> tree builder http://www.geneious.com based on protein sequences .

trna modifying genes from s. cerevisiae or e. coli were used for blast search in tair database to find homologous genes in arabidopsis thaliana. arabidopsis genes for each modified nucleosides detected in this study is listed and gene used in query was shown in bracket. for multiple gene homologs found in arabidopsis the query gene is shown in bracket next to the last gene. genes for m2a and m6a modification were not available, tsaa for m6t6a did not give any homologous genes in arabidopsis. predicted subcellular localization of gene products was shown when at least two prediction programs gave the same result .

dihydrouridine  and pseudouridine  modification genes belong to dihydrouridine synthase superfamily or pseudouridine synthase superfamily, respectively. dus1p-dus4p are required for d modification at six different positions in yeast trna  <cit> . dus3p homologs in plants were well grouped, less well for dus1p homologs and no grouping was obvious for dus2p and dus4p . pseudouridine is the most widely distributed modified nucleoside. it has been identified at  <dig> different positions on yeast trna  <cit> . in total, almost  <dig> homologous genes were found in plants, which code for modification enzymes responsible for Ψ at different locations on plant trna . to completely understand the differences between these gene homologs requires more phylogenetic and motif analyses and will not be investigated in this study.

methylation is the most common rna modification, many methylated modified nucleosides exist in plant trna . m1g is one of the most conserved modifications in trna. trm5p and trm10p are enzymes involved in the modification of m1g at different positions in s. cerevisiae. although carrying similar biochemical activity, these two proteins do not share homology and are likely unrelated  <cit> . the trm5p enzyme for m1g <dig> modification is an ancient protein. it is also involved in m1i modification  <cit> . three trm <dig> gene homologs and one trm <dig> gene homolog were found in arabidopsis and gene homologs are widely distributed in other plant species. trm11p and trm112p are both required for m2g modification in yeast trna  <cit> . one trm <dig> and two trm <dig> gene homologs were found in arabidopsis. conserved residues d <dig> of motif i and d <dig> of motif iv which are crucial for trm11p catalytic activity  <cit>  were conserved in all plant trm <dig> gene homologs . trm <dig> codes for trna methyltransferase in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . three arabidopsis trm <dig> gene homologs were found. plant trm <dig> gene homologs were divided into two groups . trm8p and trm82p form protein complexes required for m7g modification  <cit> . two trm <dig> gene homologs were found in arabidopsis and plant trm <dig> gene homologs can be divided into two groups. plant trm <dig> gene homologs are recognized as wd40-domain proteins  which confer a wide variety of functions. m5u is one of the most conserved modified nucleosides, trm2p protein contains trna methyltransferase activity in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in arabidopsis, two trm <dig> gene homologs were found. the yeast trm4p protein catalyzes formation of m5c at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . eight trm <dig> gene homologs were found in arabidopsis belonging to the nop1/nop2/sun protein family. trm <dig> and trm <dig> are essential genes coding for the two subunits of trna methyltransferase in yeast. one homolog was found in arabidopsis thaliana for trm <dig> and trm <dig>  respectively. m1i modification requires two gene products in yeast, trm5p for methylation and tad1p for deamination of a  <cit> . trm <dig> homologs have been mentioned above. the tad1p protein contains a deaminase domain and the conserved residue, e <dig>  is maintained in all plant tad <dig> gene homologs .

in addition to base methylation, ribose methylation requires another group of methyl-transferases. trm13p is responsible for am and cm modification at position  <dig> in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . trm13p does not share obvious homology with other methyltransferases, plant trm <dig> gene homologs all contain the trm <dig> superfamily domain. one arabidopsis trm <dig> gene homolog was found, however, we failed to detect decreased amounts of am in t-dna knock-out mutants of this gene . the trm7p protein is responsible for both cm <dig> and gm <dig> modification in yeast  <cit> . three trm <dig> gene homologs were found in arabidopsis. trm44p was identified recently as trna methyltransferase in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . although um was detected in arabidopsis and poplar trnas in this study, trm <dig> gene homolog were not found. trm <dig> gene is responsible for gm <dig> modification  <cit> . one trm <dig> gene homolog was found in arabidopsis; however, once again we did not find any change of gm content in a t-dna knockout mutant carrying an insertion in an exon of this gene. this may be due to the presence of gm at other positions.

at least  <dig> proteins have been shown to be involved in ncm5u modification in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . elp1- <dig> are components of the elongator complex which are also involved in ncm5u modification by unknown mechanisms. sit4p, sap185p, sap190p and kti12p are a group of proteins that affect the phosphorylation status of elp <dig> protein  <cit> . one elp <dig> homolog was found in arabidopsis and a few were identified in other plant species. interestingly the arabidopsis abo <dig> mutant has been shown to be more resistant to drought and oxidative stress  <cit> . sit4p belongs to the calcuneurin-like phosphoesterase protein family and  <dig> sit <dig> gene homologs were found in arabidopsis. four arabidopsis genes were found to be sap185p and sap190p homologs. kti11- <dig> proteins are involved in resistance to k. lactis killer toxin of s. cerevisiae  <cit> : kti13p belongs to the rcc <dig> family  involved in regulating chromatin partitioning and cell division; kti14p belongs to the casein kinase i-like protein family and physically interacts with the elongator complex  <cit> . one arabidopsis gene was found for kti11p, one for kti12p, six were found for kti13p and around  <dig> homologs were found for kti14p.

inosine is a common modified nucleoside found in trnas. in s. cerevisiae tad2p and tad3p are subunits of adenosine deaminase for i <dig> formation  <cit> . both proteins contain a deaminase domain and position e <dig> in tad2p which is important for activity was retained in all plant tad <dig> homologs . tan1p is responsible for ac4c modification in yeast  <cit>  and one arabidopsis tan <dig> homolog was found. plant tan <dig> homologs can be divided into two groups . the sua <dig> gene has been identified as a trna synthase  <cit> . one sua <dig> homolog was found in arabidopsis and several were identified in other plants. ms2io6a modifications have two side chains: the ms2-group requires the miab protein in s. enterica and e. coli  <cit>  and for i6- group modification, the mod <dig> gene is required in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the miae protein is required for modifying i6a to io6a in s. enterica. we found ms2io6a present in both arabidopsis and hybrid aspen trnas. two miab gene homologs were found in arabidopsis and nine isopentenyl-transferases  have been identified in arabidopsis, however, only two  use trna as substrate  <cit> . no miae homologs were found in arabidopsis.

based on the trna modification candidate genes found in arabidopsis , we decide to use publically available t-dna mutant lines to identify genes specific for each modified nucleoside in arabidopsis. we have chosen the genes of small gene families for which less than three genes were potentially involved in a certain modifications.  <dig> t-dna insertional mutant lines were ordered from the european arabidopsis stock center  for  <dig> genes involved in nine different modified nucleosides. homozygote lines were isolated and modified nucleosides in total trna were subsequently analyzed. twelve homozygous t-dna lines were isolated, among them six lines were defective in four specific modified nucleosides: m1g, m2g, m7g and ncm5u , t-dna lines and their insertion sites are shown schematically in figure  <dig>  t-dna lines in gene at5g <dig>  showed a 50% decrease in m1g content compared to wild type plants . we named this gene attrm <dig>  no m7g could be detected in plants with a t-dna insertion in gene at1g <dig> . this gene is homologous to trm82p. at1g <dig> was named attrm <dig>  mutant plants from t-dna nasc lines n <dig> and n <dig> showed no detectable ncm5u . the corresponding genes, at5g <dig> and at1g <dig> were named atelp <dig> and atkti <dig>  at3g <dig> was homologous to trm11pthe gene required for m2g modification in s. cerevisiae. only  <dig> % of m2g remained in mutant plants compared to wild type plants , at3g <dig> was named attrm <dig> 

t-dna line
amount of certain modified nucleosides were shown using relative quantification to internal standard , percentage of wild type level was shown in bracket.

subcellular localization of trna modifying enzymes is an important issue, trna molecules are distributed in different subcellular compartments therefore modified nucleosides differ in mitochondria, chloroplast and cytoplasm. we performed prediction of protein subcellular localization using three programs: targetp, wolfpsort and eslpred . the results from the three prediction program complement each other because different algorisms were used. distribution of plant trna modification in different subcellular organelles is one of the future work to do, however we need to be cautious about cross-contamination to avoid false-positives because some of the modified nucleosides are present in low abundance.

trna modifications are involved in regulating organ growth, stress responses and flowering time in arabidopsis thaliana
among the five genes identified in this study, two genes showed phenotype in the knock-out mutants. attrm <dig> and attrm <dig> mutants which showed dramatic decrease of m1g  and m7g  modified nucleosides respectively, did not show any phenotype under ld conditions. the atkti <dig> mutant, which carries a t-dna inserted in an exon of at1g <dig> similar to the previously isolated drl <dig> mutant  <cit>  showed no detectable ncm5u , however, narrow leaves and meristem defect phenotypes in drl <dig> mutant were not observed in the atkti <dig> mutant.

the atelp <dig> mutant, which carries a t-dna insertion in the third exon of at5g <dig>  similar to the previously identified elo <dig> mutant <cit>  showed no detectable ncm5u . the elo <dig> mutant belongs to the elongata mutants that have pleitrophic phenotypes, generally identified as reduced organ growth: narrow leaf, reduced growth of primary roots, altered inflorescence architecture and reduced length, delayed seeding growth  <cit> . the elo2/abo <dig> mutant also showed increased resistance to drought and oxidative stress, hypersensitivity towards aba and elevated expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes <cit> . the atelp <dig> protein can complement the yeast Δelp <dig> mutant  <cit>  and physically interacts with atkit <dig>  <cit> . the atelp <dig> mutant in this study showed a narrow leaf shape , and also reduced leaf numbers compare to wild type plants  and serrated leaf edges of the third and fourth true leaves . these phenotypes were also observed under short-day conditions . atelp <dig> mutant plants showed reduced root growth on ms medium plate  compared to wild type plants . atelp <dig> mutants had reduced lateral shoot growth after the removal of the primary shoot. lateral shoots had difficulties with remaining erect due to a defect in vascular tissues . finally, silique morphology was aberrant in this mutant .

the attrm <dig> mutant, which carries t-dna insertion in the third exon of at3g <dig>  showed a small amount  of m2g . under ld conditions the attrm <dig> mutant plant showed an early-flowering phenotype  as well as reduced root growth on ms medium plates . in s. cerevisiae, trm112p is needed for m2g modification by regulating trm11p activity  <cit> . no t-dna lines are available for the two trm <dig> homologs in arabidopsis. modifying enzymes for m2g at other positions have not been reported.

analysis of gene expression and phylogeny
we have investigated the expression pattern of all the arabidopsis trna modification candidate genes identified in this study using the atgenexpress database .  <dig> tissue samples were included. the candidate genes were grouped according to predicted function in specific modified nucleosides and mean-normalized expression values from the atgenexpress database were transformed into log values for heat map construction using mev  software. most genes had prominent expression in rosette leaves and apex tissues, except for the d and ncm5u modification genes. the attrm <dig>  attrm <dig>  attrm <dig>  atkti <dig> and atelp <dig> genes identified in this study are marked with an asterisk. from the tilviz database, except for atkti <dig>  their expression was highest in apex tissues, and the expression level was higher in inflorescence apices than in vegetative apices according to the tiling dataset . atkti <dig> is only expressed in late stages of seed development. the expression heat map is a guideline for developmental and tissue specific expression of the candidate genes. the expression profile is very important for functional study. if the phenotype of the transgenic plants is consistent with the expression pattern, the following-up experiments will be performed in the right tissues and at the right developmental stages.

we searched for homologs for the  <dig> modified nucleosides and dihydrouridine present in arabidopsis and hybrid aspen. arabidopsis trna modification candidate genes are listed in table  <dig>  an unrooted neighbour-joining tree was constructed showing the phylogeny between plant genes in relation to yeast genes . the result shows that most gene families in arabidopsis also exist in other plants; however, the number of genes in each family varies. in this section we will discuss only the homologs for the five arabidopsis trna modification genes identified in this study: i.e. the homologs for attrm <dig>  attrm <dig>  attrm <dig>  atkti <dig> and atelp <dig>  trm10p is a conserved methyl-transferase, but it does not contain a typical adomet-binding domain and shares no homology with other classical trna methyltransferases, e.g. trm5p  <cit> . fourteen plant trm10homologs were found, including one arabidopsis gene , two from m. truncatula and three from p. trichocarpa . trm11p is required for m2g modification in yeast trna. the residues d <dig> and d <dig> that are essential for trm11p catalytic activity are retained in all plant trm <dig> gene homologs, including attrm <dig> . trm82p belongs to the wd40-domain protein family. members of this protein family have different biological functions. attrm <dig> is clearly responsible for m7g modification in arabidopsis thaliana. elp <dig> and kti12p are well conserved proteins and both are involved in ncm5u modification. only a few elp <dig> homologs were found in plants , in contrast to the kti <dig> homologs that are found from archea to human .

the majority of trna modification enzymes are not essential, in bacteria only trma enzyme has been shown to be essential, however the lethality is not due to lack of m5u modification on trna but from its effect on ribosome assembly by association with rrna. in yeast three trna modifying enzymes/complexes were found to be essential: gcd10p/gcd14p, tad2p/tad3p and thg1p. at present we could not conclude which plant genes encoding trna modification enzymes are essential, however during the preliminary screening of the t-dna lines for trna modification genes in arabidopsis we were not able to isolate homozygote plant from some of the lines , which is probably due to essentiality of the corresponding genes. to confirm this, we will increase the amount of plants for screening in the next generation , at the same time we will carry out more comprehensive identification and confirmation of the trna modification candidate genes.

discussion
in this study we investigated modified nucleosides in the model plant species arabidopsis thaliana and hybrid aspen. twenty one modified nucleosides were detected in young tissues from both species. the method used did not allow for dihydrouridine  and queosine  derivatives to be analyzed. however as d is much conserved in trnas from all domains of life, we assume that d is also present in plant trnas. the tgt gene responsible for q modification has been reported in aspen  but not in arabidopsis, suggesting that q should be found in hybrid aspen but not in arabidopsis. acp3u <cit>  and k2c <cit> , which have been reported in sequenced chloroplast trna were not detected either in total trna from  <dig> d whole seedlings of arabidopsis. this may be because these modified nucleosides are present in only a few chloroplast trna, meaning that their abundance is below the detection threshold for the method used in this study. trna enrichment from chloroplast compartments might allow us to see these modifications more easily. generally patterns of modified nucleosides in plants are similar to those observed in yeast and calf liver, however, several modified nucleosides, including mcm5u, mcm5s2u, y and yoh that have been detected in yeast individual trna species were not detected in plant trnas, potentially because of extremely low abundance. two prokaryotic modified nucleosides, m2a and ms2io6a, were present in plant trnas. it is likely that these are from chloroplast or mitochondria subcellular compartments. m3c is present in yeast trna but was not observed in the trnas in this study. at present we are unable to conclude whether this is because m3c is present in low abundance or that plants lacks genes responsible for m3c modification. four novel nucleosides were discovered in plant trnas. in subsequent work, we will further characterize the identities of these compounds by use of combined lc-ms method.

for the  <dig> known modified nucleosides mentioned above, we used a loss-of-function study and identified five genes responsible for four specific modified nucleosides, m1g , m2g , m7g  and ncm5u . modified nucleosides participate in fine-tuning the activity of trnas during translation. for example, defects of certain trna modifications result in decreased translation efficiency and increased translational error. depending on which codon the trna recognizes and the codon context, various aspects of cellular metabolism and signaling pathways may be altered. two of the arabidopsis trna modification mutants identified in this study showed an early flowering phenotype  and had reduced organ growth , respectively. to study the mechanism of early-flowering of attrm <dig> mutant, we will investigate expression of some flowering key regulators  to see which pathway is affected in the mutant. flowering regulation in arabidopsis is rather complicated network but investigating expression of the key regulators will help to unravel the molecular mechanism. atelp <dig> has been reported being involved in different developmental processes  and stress response ; we will study gene expression and regulation in the different pathways. with more genes to be identified in the future, we expect to see a more complex profile of the function of modified nucleosides in plant growth, development and stress responses. to understand the molecular mechanisms involved, we need to investigate the temporal and tissue specific expression of trna modification enzymes, to find the targets of genes underlying the phenotypic changes of each mutant. in addition to regulation on a translational level, certain arabidopsis trna modifying enzymes might also interact physically with other proteins.

in this study we have established a method for the analysis of modified nucleosides in transfer rna from plants. with this method we identified five genes responsible for specific modified nucleosides. the advantage of the hplc method is that we could observe global changes of all the modified nucleosides. the disadvantage is that the sensitivity of the hplc method we are using could not detect very low abundance modified nucleosides that may be present in only on a few trna molecules and the hplc method alone could not determine the identity of unknown compounds. however, in future experiments we should be able to overcome these problems by enriching for individual trna species using hybridization-based dynabead technology followed by hplc analysis; and by combining the hplc with lc-ms or by enriching the compound of interest by hplc followed by ms or nmr studies to resolve the structure. with the method established in this study, more trna modification genes in plants should be able to be identified. characterization of mutants for these genes will reveal the function of modified nucleosides in plant physiology and gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we established a method for analyzing modified nucleosides of trna from plant tissues, described the amount and recovery efficiency for each step. we detected  <dig> modified nucleosides in young seedlings of arabidopsis and from young tissues of hybrid aspen . more importantly, we have predicted and summarized the trna modification candidate genes in plants. through loss-of-function studies we identified five genes responsible for four specific modified nucleosides in arabidopsis thaliana: attrm <dig> for m1g, attrm <dig> for m2g, attrm <dig> for m7g, atkti <dig> and atelp <dig> for ncm5u modification. we conclude with the method established here, more modified nucleosides in plants can be investigated in order to understand the function of trna modifications in plant growth, development and stress responses. this systematic study on trna modification genes in arabidopsis is very useful as a tool for those in the same research area and those who are interested in developing new research projects related to nucleoside modification on small rnas. also the four novel plant-specific modified nucleosides will be of great interest for plant researchers.
