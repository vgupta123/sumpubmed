BACKGROUND
more than sixty different types of human enteroviruses have been identified  <cit> . species human enterovirus a  which include  <dig> members of the coxsackievirus a  group; cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv- <dig>  cv- <dig>  cv-a <dig> and human enterovirus  <dig>  are associated with several human diseases  <cit> . cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> are known to cause herpangina  <cit> ; cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> cause aseptic meningitis  <cit>  and cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and ev- <dig> usually cause hand, foot and mouth disease   <cit> . amongst these hev-a viruses, only ev- <dig> is associated with major outbreaks involving infections with severe neurological complications and deaths. recent outbreaks in malaysia, taiwan and vietnam claimed more than  <dig> deaths  <cit> . in these outbreaks, ev- <dig> was isolated from patients' specimens and post-mortem tissues, suggesting its direct involvement as the etiologic agent  <cit> . molecular epidemiological investigations performed using the partial gene sequences of all available ev- <dig> isolates suggested the presence of several ev- <dig> lineages co-circulating during most of the asian outbreaks  <cit> . ev- <dig> subgenotypes b <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> were reported in malaysia with subgenotype b <dig> being the most prevalent in the  <dig> outbreak  <cit> . the subgenotype b <dig> was present initially at a low level but became endemic and eventually replaced subgenotype b <dig> as the predominant virus in the subsequent outbreaks in malaysia and the region  <cit> . neither the b <dig> nor b <dig> subgenotype, however, was associated with any fatal infections outside the malaysia  <dig> outbreak. similarly, the c <dig> isolates were identified as the main causal agent of the hfmd-associated severe and fatal infections during the  <dig> taiwan outbreak  <cit> . these isolates also caused severe infections in the perth  <dig> outbreak  <cit>  but no report of serious infection or death attributed to these isolates was recorded from the malaysia  <dig> outbreak  <cit> . recently, two new ev- <dig> subgenotypes, c <dig> and c <dig> were proposed to accommodate ev- <dig> strains isolated from cases of aseptic meningitis and paralysis in korea and china, respectively  <cit> . there were no reports, however, that the subgenotype c <dig> isolates were associated with severe infections  <cit> . the emergence of the various ev- <dig> subgenotypes with varying degree of clinical severity is puzzling. the viruses together with other hev-a viruses are known to be present in the region and usually cause the typical mild hfmd  <cit> . in the present study, the potential mechanisms that could play important role in the emergence of the different ev- <dig> subgenotypes are phylogenetically investigated.

RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships between ev- <dig> and other hev-a viruses
the complete genome sequences of all the ev- <dig> isolates were aligned with other available hev-a complete genome sequences obtained from the genbank. the total length of the genomes varied between 7395– <dig> nucleotides and they encode for 2189– <dig> amino acids. the differences in genome length were caused by the presence of deletions or insertions within the 5' utr, capsid gene and 3' utr sequences. the capsid genome region of ev- <dig> was longer  or of the same length with other hev-a viruses, with the exception of cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> which have eight extra amino acid insertions. no deletions and insertions were observed in the p <dig> and p <dig> genomic regions, hence, the gene length within these genomic regions remained constant for all the hev-a viruses.

ev- <dig> vp <dig> gene sequences had an average sequence divergence of 17–22% at nucleotide level and 3–8% at amino acid level, respectively. the average sequence divergence between ev- <dig> vp <dig> and other hev-a viruses was 22–29% at the nucleotide level and 10–20% at amino acid level, respectively . these suggested that ev- <dig> in general, were distinct from all the other existing hev-a viruses and using the ev- <dig> vp <dig> gene sequence, several subgenotypes were identified  <cit> . an unrooted phylogenetic tree constructed using the whole genome sequences of all ev- <dig> and hev-a viruses had all the ev- <dig> isolates subdivided into three genotypes, a, b  and c . the phylogenetic tree was similar to that constructed using the vp <dig> gene sequence with all the hev-a viruses clustered into their respective groups . a similar tree topology depicting the characteristic grouping of ev- <dig> and other hev-a viruses was obtained using the complete amino acid sequences .

at the 5' utr genomic region, the prototype ev- <dig>  brcr branched out together with cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>  and segregated away from the rest of the ev- <dig> genotypes. isolates of ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> were phylogenetically closer to cv-a <dig> and this segregation was supported by a high bootstrap value . ev- <dig> genotype b and c <dig> remained as one cluster, while cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and two cv-a <dig>  cv-a16/g <dig> and tainan <dig> grouped into another distinct cluster. at the p <dig> genomic region, no segregation of any ev- <dig> isolates was observed and all the other hev-a isolates were distantly related to one another . the tree topology was very similar to that drawn using complete amino acid sequences . based on the tree drawn using the p <dig> genomic region, at least six clustering patterns were observed;  all the ev- <dig> isolates together with cv-a <dig>   cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>   cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>   cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>   cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> and  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>  these patterns received high bootstrap support  and corresponded to the neutralization cross-reactivity patterns observed previously  <cit> .

at the p <dig> genomic region, ev- <dig> brcr clustered with cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>  while the ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> isolates were phylogenetically closer to cv-a <dig> . ev- <dig> isolates of subgenotype b <dig> and c <dig> segregated from all other ev- <dig> and formed a cluster together with cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a16/g <dig> . cv-a <dig> tainan <dig> segregated away from the prototype cv-a16/g <dig> and grouped with ev- <dig> brcr, cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> . at the p <dig> genomic region, the different ev- <dig> lineages formed four distinct clusters together with other hev-a viruses. isolates of subgenotype c <dig> were phylogenetically closer to cv-a <dig> and this was supported by a high bootstrap value . isolates of subgenotype b <dig> and c <dig> isolates clustered with cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> and support for the clustering was also significant . ev- <dig> isolates of subgenotype b <dig> and b <dig> were phylogenetically closer to cv-a <dig>  although this did not receive high bootstrap support . the genotype a isolate brcr segregated from all the recent ev- <dig> subgenotypes and clustered with cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> . at the p <dig> genomic region, isolate cv-a <dig> tainan <dig> segregated away from cv-a16/g <dig> and grouped with ev- <dig> brcr, cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> .

an unrooted phylogenetic tree drawn using only the 3' utr showed clustering of ev- <dig> isolates of subgenotype of b <dig> and c <dig> with cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> . no significant segregation , however, was observed for the remaining isolates and this was perhaps due to the short sequence length of the 3' utr. the clustering of isolates of subgenotype b <dig> and c <dig> with cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig> at the 3' utr genomic region was consistent with the previous clustering at the p <dig> and p <dig> genomic regions. based on these results, it appeared that sequences of genes at the 3' half of the ev- <dig> genome contributed to the multiple and diverse ev- <dig> subgenotypes and these genes showed high similarity to different hev-a viruses.

inter-typic recombination between ev- <dig> and other hev-a viruses
the conflicting tree topologies in the 5' utr, p <dig> and p <dig> genomic regions raised the possibility that the different ev- <dig> genotypes contained chimeric genome sequences, perhaps as a result of a previous recombination event. similarity plot analysis performed using consensus sequences of each ev- <dig> subgenotype against other ev- <dig> subgenotypes and hev-a viruses showed that the p <dig> genomic region of all the ev- <dig> genotypes have relatively high genome sequence similar to each other  with very low sequence similarity  to other hev-a viruses. in the p <dig> and p <dig> genomic regions, however, three different similarity patterns for all the ev- <dig> isolates were observed. the first pattern grouped ev- <dig> genotype a, brcr with cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>  these viruses shared relatively high sequence similarity  to each other, and with low sequence similarity to other ev- <dig> genotypes . the second pattern grouped ev- <dig> isolates to their respective genotypes. isolates of genotype b were highly similar to each other for examples, subgenotype b <dig>  ms <dig> had high sequence similarity to subgenotype b <dig>  and vice versa, subgenotype b <dig> isolates had high sequence similarity to the subgenotype b <dig> . the third pattern included ev- <dig> isolates of subgenotype b <dig> and c <dig>  these isolates had high sequence similarity to ev- <dig> genotype b, cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a16/g <dig> at p <dig> genomic region  and high sequence similarity to cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a16/g <dig> at p <dig> genomic region , figure 3c, 3f, 3g). at the p <dig> genomic region, the sequence similarity of isolates of subgenotype b <dig> and c <dig> to the rest of the ev- <dig> genotypes was only between 75–79%. similarly, ev- <dig> of subgenotype c <dig> shared higher sequence similarity to cv-a <dig>  and low sequence similarity to other existing ev- <dig> genotypes . these phylogenetic segregations received a high bootstrap support value . using a smaller scanning window size of  <dig> nucleotides, the 5' utr of subgenotype c <dig> isolates also showed high sequence similarity to cv-a <dig> .

evidence of multiple recombination crossover points with at least five breakpoints delineating the whole genome was obtained from the similarity plot analysis of ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> isolate, shzh <dig> . for this analysis, a smaller scanning window size of  <dig> nucleotides and sequences of ev- <dig> isolates were used together with cv-a16/g <dig> as the outgroup virus. this was done to overcome the phylogeny noise problem. three genomic regions nucleotides 1– <dig>  3634– <dig> and 6770– <dig> showed 88%, 82% and 84% genome sequence similarity to ev- <dig> genotype a, respectively. one genomic region  shared ≥ 88% sequence similarity to ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> while another genomic region  had 83% sequence similarity to cv-a16/g <dig> . the χ <dig> values supporting the presence of ev- <dig> genotype c and cv-a16/g <dig> genome sequences within the genome of isolate shzh <dig> were maximal at the genomic region spanning nucleotides 378– <dig> and 4157– <dig>  respectively. these results reflect possible mosaicism of isolate shzh <dig> genome involving sequences of ev- <dig> genotype c structural genes, cv-a16/g <dig> non-structural genes and the remnants or perhaps fossilized ancestral sequences of the prototype ev- <dig> brcr, interspersed within the genome. it was noted, however, that the brcr-like sequences were no longer found in the non-structural regions of the more recent subgenotype c <dig> virus isolate, shzh <dig>  and based on the maximum χ <dig> values, only two crossover points were located within nucleotides 156– <dig>  and 3755– <dig> . at the 5' utr, however, the first  <dig> nucleotides were still similar to brcr sequences but the latter crossover point switched the genome from subgenotype c <dig> to cv-a16-like sequences with no insertion of brcr sequences. these results provided additional evidence that ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> isolates may have emerged due to recombination between subgenotype c <dig> and cv-a16/g10-like viruses.

support for inter-typic recombination involving cv-a <dig> and ev- <dig> were also obtained from the phylogenetic investigation of the cv-a <dig> tainan <dig>  several recombination breakpoints were revealed when the cv-a <dig> tainan <dig> whole genome sequence was queried against several potential parental genome sequences . a major recombination breakpoint was identified between nucleotides 3616– <dig> within the 2a gene , hence switching the cv-a <dig> tainan <dig> genome sequences to that of the non-structural gene sequences of ev- <dig> brcr . two additional breakpoints were noted between nucleotides 168– <dig> and 513– <dig> of the 5' utr sequences switching the genome sequence from cv-a16-like to that of ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> . acquisition of the ev- <dig> subgenotype c <dig> sequences also resulted in the cv-a <dig> tainan <dig> isolate acquiring the ev-71-like 5' utr rna stem loop structure . when the amino acid sequences of the non-structural genes were examined, at least  <dig> amino acids were found to be similar to that encoded by the ancestral ev- <dig> brcr and not to cv-a <dig> g/ <dig>  of these amino acids,  <dig> amino acid differences occurred within the 3d rna polymerase gene alone, suggesting that the gene was very much ev-71-like than cv-a <dig> . these results revealed that the recently isolated cv-a <dig> had most of its genome 5' half including all the structural genes except the 5' utr consisting of cv-a16-like sequences and the remaining 3' half of the genome consisting of the supposedly no longer circulating ev- <dig> genotype a brcr sequence.

discussion
results from the full genome sequence similarity plot analyses and phylogenetic investigations presented here support the possible occurrence of inter-typic recombination involving ev- <dig> and various hev-a, including cv-a <dig>  the common causal agent of hfmd. all the ev- <dig> isolates examined had conserved 5' half of the genome, which consisted of mainly the structural genes including vp <dig>  vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  these structural gene sequences particularly vp <dig> and vp <dig> when used to construct the phylogenetic trees clustered all ev- <dig> isolates into a unique clade of its own, away from other hev-a viruses. this justifies usage of these genes for the molecular identification of ev isolates  <cit> . it is possible that the structural genes especially the virus capsid gene, carries genetic restrictions required to ensure virus receptor recognition, binding and entry into host cells, and hence remain highly conserved. cv-a16-like sequences were present within the genome 3' end of ev- <dig> subgenotype b <dig> and c <dig>  conversely, ev-71-like sequences were also found within the genome 3' end of cv-a <dig> tainan <dig>  these highlight the possible occurrence of recombination events in the wild between the two common causal agents of hfmd. this possibility is not difficult to envisage considering that both ev- <dig> and cv-a <dig> viruses are known to co-circulate within the same population and cause a common disease. it is particularly true in parts of the world where the level of hygiene practices and sanitation are lacking or less developed, as in these circumstances the possibility of co-infection is expected to be higher.

results from the present study also suggest that inter-typic recombination events occurred between ev- <dig>  cv-a <dig> and other hev-a viruses. the incongruent phylogeny patterns observed suggest the possible occurrence of recombination in ev- <dig> in a similar manner to those previously reported for a number of enteroviruses  <cit> . it is reported that most of the current circulating hev-b viruses are actually recombinants relative to its prototype strains isolated in the 1950s  <cit> . recombination amongst hev-a viruses has also been described in cv-a <dig>  cv-a <dig> and cv-a <dig>  <cit>  and a novel group of hev-a consisting of ev- <dig>  ev- <dig>  ev- <dig> and ev- <dig>  <cit> . the p <dig> genomic region of ev- <dig>  a virus that causes acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis is highly similar to ev and rhinovirus. in addition, the p <dig> and p <dig> genomic regions are phylogenetically closer to cv-b and swine vesicular disease virus  <cit> . another ev, cv-b <dig>  has its major capsid proteins that are most closely related to swine vesicular disease virus, with the 5' and 3' utr and the p <dig> genomic region that are highly similar to the corresponding regions of other cv-b viruses  <cit> . other example of ev with highly diverse genome sequence origin includes the prototype ev- <dig> isolated in california in  <dig>  this ev has p <dig> genomic region that is highly similar to echovirus  <dig>  echovirus  <dig>  echovirus  <dig> and echovirus  <dig>  with the p <dig> and p <dig> genomic regions that share high similarity to cv-b <dig>  <cit> . together, these findings reiterate the suggestion that recombination is one of the potential mechanisms by which genetic diversity, is generated in ev- <dig> and other hev-a viruses especially within the non-structural genes where recombination hot spots are mainly located  <cit> . while recombination could occur within the structural gene region, it perhaps yielded nonviable or unstable progeny viruses that did not survive and this could be due to generation of less fit variants with deleterious mutations  <cit> . selection of a better fit virus is likely to have contributed towards the demise of the recombinant ev- <dig> b <dig> virus once found prevalent in peninsula malaysia and sarawak during the  <dig> outbreak, singapore and japan in  <dig>  <cit>  and perth in  <dig>  <cit> . this virus was shown to replicate less efficiently in comparison to ev- <dig> b <dig> viruses  <cit> , hence it could be the reason why it was rapidly replaced with ev- <dig> b <dig> viruses which remained endemic in the region for at least up to  <dig>  causing infections in sarawak, singapore, taiwan and japan  <cit> . the acquisition of a segment of genes from cv-a <dig> by ev- <dig> b <dig> virus  <cit>  could have rendered the virus less fit to adapt to a new environment especially the host immunity.

CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic evidence of possible inter-typic recombination amongst hev-a viruses including between the two causal agents of hfmd, ev- <dig> and cv-a <dig>  were obtained from analyses using the virus isolates' full genome sequences. the finding highlights the potential role of recombination in the emergence of the newer ev- <dig> lineages including those perhaps with varied virulence and clinical manifestations. active molecular surveillance of ev- <dig> and cv-a <dig> would help to ensure rapid identification of emergence of any potentially highly virulent ev- <dig> or cv-a <dig> strains. this is particularly pertinent in regions where recurring hfmd outbreaks involving the different hev-a have occurred.
