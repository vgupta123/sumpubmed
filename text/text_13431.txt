BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process of germ cell differentiation that can be subdivided into three main phases: spermatogonial proliferation, meiosis of spermatocytes and spermiogenesis of haploid spermatids. the meiotic and haploid phases of spermatogenesis are characterized by high transcriptional activity but suppressed translational activity. post-transcriptional control of gene expression in these phases is a significant feature of mammalian spermatogenesis  <cit> . micrornas  are a family of small non-coding rnas , which play important roles in regulating post-transcriptional gene silence through base-pair binding to their target mrna  <cit> . emerging evidences have suggested that the involvement of mirnas in mammalian spermatogenesis. first, numerous mirnas are exclusively or preferentially expressed in the mouse testis  <cit> . second, the pattern of mirna expression appears to be different between immature and mature mouse testis  <cit> . last but not least, spermatogenesis is disrupted at the early stage of proliferation and/or early differentiation in mouse in which the dicer gene, encoding an rnase iii required for mirna processing, has been deleted in the testis  <cit> . additionally, several studies have indicated that some mirnas participate in mammalian spermatogenesis. for example, mirna-122a reduces the expression of the post-transcriptionally regulated germ cell transition nuclear protein  <dig>  mrna in the mammalian testis  <cit> ; mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have been implicated as oncogenes in testicular germ cell tumors  <cit> ; mir- <dig> is associated with male infertility and promotes testicular embryonal carcinoma cell proliferation by targeting interferon regulatory factor- <dig>  <cit> .

it has been shown that mir- <dig> is mainly expressed in the testis and brain, and that its expression levels in the testis are much higher than those in the brain  <cit> . however, the role of mir- <dig> in mammalian spermatogenesis remains unclear. here, we reported for the first time that mir- <dig> expression levels increased with the postnatal development of the mouse testis and its expression was restricted to testicular germ cells. we further provided evidence that mir- <dig> could downregulate nuclear receptor corepressor  <dig>  by targeting its 3'- untranslated region  and inhibiting ncor <dig> protein translation. our findings suggest that mir- <dig> may be involved in the post-transcription regulation of mrnas such as ncor <dig> in mammalian spermatogenesis.

RESULTS
mir- <dig> expression levels increased during the postnatal development of the mouse testis
as shown in figure  <dig>  levels of mir- <dig> increased during the postnatal development of the mouse testis. at postnatal day  <dig> when zygotene spermatocytes appear  <cit> , mir- <dig> levels increased by  <dig> fold compared with postnatal day  <dig>  mir- <dig> levels continued to accumulate thereafter with an increase by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 289-fold at postnatal day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

mir- <dig> was located to the germ cells of mouse testis
the testis mainly contains two kinds of cell types: germ cells and somatic cells. which cell type expresses mir- <dig> in the testis? to answer this question, in-situ hybridization assays were used to examine the mir- <dig> localization in the adult mouse testis. as shown in figure  <dig>  mir- <dig> was mainly detected in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia, spermatocytes in all stages of seminiferous epithelium. round spermatids in stage i to stage viii also expressed mir- <dig>  while the elongating spermatids in stage ix and stage x, elongated and condensed spermatids in stage xi, stage i to stage vi did not show any positive signals. moreover, leydig cells in the interstitial tissue of the testis, peritubule myoid cells around the seminiferous tubule and sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubule were negative for mir- <dig> 

mir- <dig> overexpression promoted gc-1spg proliferation
to evaluate the characteristic of mir- <dig> in germ cells, we transfected a double-stranded rna that mimics the mir- <dig> precursor  into gc-1spg. gc-1spg is a kind of germ cell line that corresponds to a stage between type b spermatogonia and primary spermatocyte  <cit> . the cy3-labeled scramble oligonucleotide was used as a negative control. the high transfection efficiency was confirmed by observation red dots around nuclear under fluorescence light . the increased levels of mir- <dig> upon overexpression were demonstrated by quantitative rt-pcr . fcs analysis revealed that mir- <dig> overexpression resulted in significantly lower number of cells in the g <dig> phase  and significantly higher number of cells in the s/g/m <dig> phase  compared with the scramble negative control . this result suggests that overexpression of mir- <dig> in gc-1spg could promote cells from g <dig> phase to s/g/m <dig> phase, indicating that mir- <dig> could induce gc-1spg proliferation. to further evaluate the effects of mir- <dig> on gc-1spg, mts  assays were used. mts is a compound that is bio-reduced by living cells into a formazan product that is coloured and soluble in cell culture medium. the quantity of formazan product as measured by the amount of  <dig> nm absorbance is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. we measured the  <dig> nm absorbance at different time after transfection of mir- <dig> into gc-1spg. the mts assay showed that the relative cell number was significantly increased with overexpression of mir- <dig>  . these results indicate that mir- <dig> promotes gc-1spg proliferation.

mir- <dig> targeted ncor <dig> at its 3'utr
mirnas have been predicted to regulate genes expression through binding to the 3'utr of the target mrnas. which gene might be the target of mir-184? to answer this question, targetscan software  <cit>  was used to screen the potential targets of mir- <dig>  there are  <dig> predicted targets of mir- <dig> based on targetscan screening. we were interested in ncor <dig>  because it has been reported that ncor <dig> was expressed in the testis  <cit> . our data also showed that the expression levels of ncor <dig> mrna and ncor <dig> protein were higher in premature mouse testis than those in adult mouse testis , which showed an anti-correlation compared with the expression levels of mir- <dig> in developing mouse testis. moreover, the 3'utr of ncor <dig> contains critical binding site  of mir- <dig>  this sequence in the 3'utr of ncor <dig> is conserved among human, monkey, rat and mouse. interestingly, there are three or two overlapping binding sites in the 3'utr of ncor <dig> in mouse or rat, respectively . in addition, it has been shown that ncor <dig> can interact with b-myb to repress its transcription and thus inhibit cell proliferation  <cit> . our data showed that overexpression of mir- <dig> in gc-1spg could promote its proliferation, suggesting that mir- <dig> might target ncor <dig> to decrease its expression and reduce the amount of ncor <dig> available for interaction with b-myb. so the transcription level of b-myb was increased, which may explain the proliferation-promoting effects of mir- <dig>  based upon the above-mentioned reasons, we focused our efforts on mir- <dig> and ncor <dig> mrna interactions.

to test whether mir- <dig> can alter the expression of ncor <dig>  we cloned the 3'utr of ncor <dig> mrna containing the overlapping mir- <dig> binding sequences into a firefly luciferase reporter vector  and cotransfected ncor2-wt and a rellina luciferase reporter vector and mir- <dig> into hela cells, in which endogenous mir- <dig> was at very low or close to none levels . as negative control, a scrambled oligonucleotide was assayed at the same time. the increased levels of mir- <dig> upon overexpression were demonstrated by quantitative rt-pcr . by quantifying levels of the normalized luciferase activities in the presence of mir- <dig>  we observed an ~  <dig> % decrease in luciferase activity with the construct bearing the 3'utr of ncor <dig> mrna . no decreases in luciferase activity was seen when mir- <dig> was replaced with a scrambled mirna.

to investigate the specificity of interactions between mir- <dig> and ncor <dig> target mrna sequence, we created one mutation construct in the ncor <dig> binding site for mir- <dig> . in this construct, six nt of the overlapping binding site for mir- <dig> were mutated . the ncor2-mut did not decrease luciferase activity .

to determine whether ncor <dig> function as a target of mir- <dig> in vivo, western-blot assays were used to test the protein levels of ncor <dig> after overexpressed mir- <dig>  as shown in figure 4e, after transfected with mir-184-mim for  <dig> h, the ncor <dig> protein levels in hela cells were decreased compared with hela cells transfected with scramble oligonucleotide. .

taken together, we conclude that ncor <dig> is the target gene of mir- <dig> 

mir- <dig> downregulated ncor <dig> through inhibiting ncor <dig> protein translation in vitro
mirnas regulate gene expression at posttranscriptional levels by either preventing mrnas from being translated or causing them to be degraded. to determine the mechanism of mir- <dig> downregulation of ncor <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr and western-blot assays were performed. as shown in figure 5a, the normalized mrna levels of ncor <dig> did not change after overexpression of mir- <dig> in gc-1spg compared with the scramble control. however, the ncor <dig> protein levels normalized to Î²-actin decreased . similar results were also demonstrated in hela cells . these results indicate that mir- <dig> could downregulate ncor <dig> through inhibiting translation in vitro.

discussion
mirnas are small non-coding rnas that play important roles in regulating post-transcriptional fate of mrnas. hundreds of mirnas have been identified in plants and animals. about 68% of mirnas are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner  <cit> . based on their tissue-specific/preferential and developmental expression patterns, mirnas are believed to play prominent regulatory roles during development.

previous studies have tested that mir- <dig> is only expressed in brain, testis and cortical epithelium in mouse  <cit> . additionally, mir- <dig> expression levels in the testis were much higher than those in the brain  <cit> . here, we found that mir- <dig> was expressed during the postnatal development of the mouse testis and its expression levels were increased with age . and we also demonstrated that mir- <dig> was localized to the germ cells of mouse testis from spermatogonia to round spermatids . as we known, a striking feature of spermatogenesis is that the gene expression patterns of spermatogenic cells exhibit spatiotemporal characteristics  <cit> . taken together, the testis-preferential spatiotemporal expression pattern of mir- <dig> during postnatal development of the mouse testis indicates that mir- <dig> could play a role in mouse spermatogenesis.

based on our finding that mir- <dig> was localized to germ cells of the mouse testis, we chose a germ cell line, gc-1spg, to identify the biological characteristics of mir- <dig> in vitro. our data showed that overexpression of mir- <dig> in gc-1spg could induce gc-1spg cell cycle promotion and proliferation , which was similar to or different from the reports of other groups. wong et al found that inhibition of mir- <dig> in tongue squamous cell carcinoma  cell lines could reduce cell proliferation rate, which indicates that mir- <dig> might play an oncogenic role in the antiapoptotic and proliferative processes of tongue scc  <cit> . chen and forley et al found that mir- <dig> overexpression induced neuroblastoma cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through targeting the serine/threonine kinase akt <dig>  <cit> . the discrepancy could be explained by the different targets of mir- <dig> in the different cell lines among the above investigations.

the prediction of mrna targets for mirnas will help characterize the mirnas involved in biological processes and the molecular mechanisms via which mirnas act. in this study, we have found that ncor <dig> is a target gene of mir- <dig> . ncor <dig>  acts as a corepressor for a range of transcription factors including retinoic acid receptors , the retinoid x receptors  and the thyroid hormone receptors  etc. in the absence of hormone ligand, ncor <dig> binds to the unliganded nuclear receptors and serves as a platform for recruitment of additional components of a larger corepressor complex that includes histone deacetylase to inhibit gene transcription. and in the presence of hormone ligand, ncor <dig> releases from the nuclear receptors, resulting the corepressor complex disruption and de-repression of gene expression  <cit> . unlike the expression pattern of mir- <dig>  ncor <dig> is expressed ubiquitously. it is expressed in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle, intestine, brain and testis  <cit> . and the expression levels in brain are higher than those in testis  <cit> , which is also different from the mir- <dig> expression levels between these two organs. interesting, we also found that the expression levels of ncor <dig> were decreased from postnatal  <dig> day testis to adult mouse testis comparing with those in postnatal  <dig> day testis , which was also different from our data showing that mir- <dig> expression levels increased during the postnatal development of mouse testis . the inverse expression patterns between mir- <dig> and ncor <dig> are consistent with our data showing that mir- <dig> could downregulate ncor <dig> through targeting its 3'utr .

the downregulation of gene expression by mirnas is a complex process involving both translational repression and mrna degradation  <cit> . in this study, we have found that the mrna of ncor <dig> did not change after overexpression of mir- <dig> in gc-1spg and hela cells. however, the ncor <dig> protein levels did decrease after mir- <dig> overexpression in these two cell lines, indicating that mir- <dig> decreased ncor <dig> protein levels not by mrna degradation, but by translational repression in vitro. the mechanisms underlying translational repression by mirnas include inhibition of translation initiation by competition between risc  and eif4e  for cap binding or by impeding the association of the small and large ribosomal subunits, inhibition of translation elongation and cotranslational degradation of nascent polypeptides  <cit> . the mechanism of how mir- <dig> regulates ncor <dig> expression remains unresolved.

mir- <dig> was first observed in the murine eye  <cit> . later, its expression pattern was determined by two groups  <cit> . about the biological functions of mir- <dig>  studies have linked its overexpression to squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue  <cit> , its downexpression to gliomas  <cit>  and mycn-amplified neuoblastoma  <cit> . moreover, it has been reported that mir- <dig> has multiple roles in drosophila female germline development  <cit> . in this study, we have found that the mir- <dig> expression levels were increased during the postnatal development of the mouse testis, mir- <dig> localization was restricted to testicular germ cells from spermatogonia to round spermatids, overexpression of mir- <dig> could promote gc-1spg proliferation and mir- <dig> downregulated ncor <dig> by targeting its 3'-utr through inhibiting ncor <dig> protein translation.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our data, it is suggested that mir- <dig> may be involved in the post-transcription regulation of mrnas such as ncor <dig> in mammalian spermatogenesis.
