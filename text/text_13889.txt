BACKGROUND
in higher plants, the transition toward flowering occurs under the control of environmental and endogenous stimuli which are categorized in several partially overlapping genetic pathways  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, the final outputs of all pathways has been shown to converge on a limited number of flower-promoting proteins in the meristem, especially those encoded by the genes flowering locus t  and suppressor of overexpression of constans  <dig>   <cit> . these proteins activate floral meristem identity genes such as leafy  and apetala <dig> , which in turn activate floral homeotic genes responsible for floral organ differentiation  <cit> . however, floral transition can be delayed by floral repressors such as terminal flower <dig>  and brother of ft and tfl <dig> , which repress lfy and ap <dig>  <cit> . moreover, regulations involving ft repressors have been highlighted in arabidopsis grown under long day  or in non-inductive conditions. floral repressors, especially short vegetative phase , flowering locus c , and tempranillo , have been shown to interact with the constans -ft genetic pathway to determine the optimal timing of floral transition depending on day length and temperature  <cit> . tem <dig> and tem <dig> can regulate ft expression to an extent that changes during development  <cit> . also, two highly conserved micrornas , mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit>  target squamosa promoter binding protein-like  family transcription factors, which promote the transition from the juvenile to the adult phase, in populus  <cit>  and key floral repressors belonging to the ap2-like transcription factor family genes  <cit> , respectively. other age-dependent pathways involve carbohydrates directly  <cit>  or in conjunction with photoperiod  <cit> . in addition, the redox status of the plant, which is linked to its perception of environment and is involved in the control of plant growth and development through the reprogramming of metabolism, might be involved in the control of floral transition  <cit> .

although there are some fundamental differences in flowering biology between annual and perennial plants, knowledge acquired in model plants can be used for examining control of flowering in perennial species  <cit> . because of their great economic importance for the horticultural industry, numerous studies have contributed to decipher the flowering process in apple and in the model tree species poplar . a set of genes showing sequence similarity with known flowering genes in arabidopsis has been shown to have similar function in apple tree . moreover, the tree juvenile phase has been successfully reduced by knocking-out or over-expressing floral or floral-repressor genes  and the temporal expression of  <dig> flowering genes in apple apical buds suggests that they may play central roles in fi and flower organ development  <cit> . however, these studies focused on aspects of flowering related to the transition from juvenile to mature trees and to seasonal control of flowering date.

although flowering is recurrent in perennial plants over consecutive years, it only occurs in a subset of buds in each growth cycle  <cit> . in apple, inflorescences may form in terminal buds of all axes. they remain preformed in dormant mixed buds that include leaf primordia followed by the inflorescence and the first primordia of an axillary shoot . the short preformed growth unit carrying the inflorescence is usually called a bourse and its axillary sympodial shoot, the bourse shoot. even though this may differ among varieties, histological observations and mrna transcript analysis agree that fi occurs in apical buds of short shoots between  <dig> and 53 days after full bloom , and that morphological changes corresponding to flower bud initiation start approximately at  <dig> dafb  <cit> . however, the floral transition occurs only once the vegetative development of the axis is completed, the timing of which varies greatly depending on its type and position within the tree  <cit> . whatever their within-tree situation, fi and flower bud initiation occur during spring or summer, i.e. in long days  and under high temperatures, while fruit development is ongoing. fruit and vegetative growth are generally considered to be negatively correlated  <cit>  and fi to be strongly inhibited by concurrent fruiting. this may lead to biennial bearing, this term referring to trees having an irregular crop load from year to year. ‘on’ years characterized by significant production are followed by ‘off’ years, characterized by low production. the low production in ‘off’ years usually results from a lack of flower formation rather than a poor fruit-set  <cit> . therefore, biennial bearing, which is a problem observed in many fruiting trees, appears to be a problem of fi rather than floral differentiation.

hence, floral transition between consecutive seasons in fruit tree species is still poorly understood and the physiological processes triggering or inhibiting flower formation remain to be identified. in mandarins, the genes and proteins profiles have been compared between fruited and defruited trees, this demonstrating that proteins involved in primary metabolism and redox state were differentially expressed in leaves depending on fruit load  <cit> . in addition, photosynthetic genes and calcium-dependent iaa transport were induced rapidly after defruiting treatment and in ‘off’ citrus trees  <cit> . in mango, the autonomous ga pathways appear to be involved in both biennial bearing and flowering control  <cit> .

in the present study, our objective was to investigate biological processes that are involved in fi in apical buds of adult apple trees. to achieve this, we manipulated trees for being in either on ‘on’ or ‘off’ status and we assumed their apical buds to be more likely under inhibition or induction conditions, respectively. we then studied the effect of the presence of fruits on the differential expression of genes involved in floral transition in apical buds of bourse shoots in those adult apple trees, using a microarray analysis. quantitative reverse transcription pcr  was also performed to study the relative expression of key flowering genes between ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees during the critical periods for fi and floral differentiation and to validate the microarray. this study highlighted processes that are differentially regulated between buds more likely to flower than others within adult apple trees. how many of these processes actually regulate flowering remains an open question that will require further investigations.

methods
plant material
sixteen year old trees of malus x domestica ‘gala’  were grown at the cehm experimental station  , according to normal commercial practices. a set of five trees was set in the ‘off’ situation by completely hand deflowering the trees at full bloom. another set of five trees with no manual or chemical thinning applied was selected to create an ‘on’ situation. buds were sampled at the terminal position of bourse shoot spurs, bearing no fruit on ‘off’ trees or from bourses carrying at least one fruit on ‘on’ trees. in our conditions, full bloom occurred the 14th april  <dig>  five harvests were performed between  <dig> and 12 a.m. from april to august  <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dafb, corresponding to day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the following manuscript. this period was considered to cover floral induction, initiation and the early beginning of flower differentiation in spur apical buds  <cit> . four trees per treatment and three buds per tree were sampled at each harvest date . sam were dissected from the terminal buds and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. three trees and three buds over five time points were used for mrna profiling by qrt-pcr. based on mrna profiling by qrt-pcr of key flowering genes, three dates among the five were chosen. on each of these dates, three buds from the four sampled trees were used for microarray analyses .

in the spring following the collection of buds , the proportion of flowering terminal buds was observed. return to bloom was characterized on lateral branches depending on the treatment applied, i.e. ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees. trees conventionally thinned in  <dig> were used as controls to evaluate the effect of the deflowering versus no-thinning treatments. five trees per treatment were observed, evaluating  <dig> to  <dig> terminal buds per tree.

rna extraction and quantification
total rna was extracted from individual apical buds using the nucleospin® rna ii’ rna kit , including dna digestion on a column, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. quantification of total rna was performed using infinite®  <dig> pro nanoquant  and rna quality was controlled using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer  .

rna profiling by qrt-pcr
three key flowering genes that had been previously characterized in apple were used as molecular markers for flowering transition for the qrt-pcr study   <cit> . along with mdft <dig>  mdft <dig>  afl <dig> and afl <dig>  these genes enabled the comparison of our results with previous studies  <cit>  and the identification of the critical period for fi in our experiment.

rna transcript level was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription pcr  following the advice of udvardi et al.  <cit> . using the same samples as for the microarray analyses, three trees and three buds per tree over five time points were used for mrna profiling by qrt-pcr, except for day  <dig> and  <dig> where only two trees were available. first-strand cdna was synthesized from 500 ng of total rna using oligo   <dig> primers and the reverse transcriptase superscriptiii  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. quality of cdna was assessed using two pairs of primers 700 bp apart and located at the 5′ and 3′-end of the reference gene elongation factor-1α . samples which threshold cycle  difference between the 5′ and 3′-end exceeded three cycles were not used further in the analysis.

presence of genomic dna contamination was assessed by designing primers for pcr either on the junction of two exons to amplify only cdna or on separated exons to amplify longer fragments on genomic dna . gene sequences used for the primer design were retrieved from the genome database for rosaceae  malus x domestica whole genome v <dig>  assembly & annotation.

for the qrt-pcr reactions, 2 μl of the cdna samples  was used as template in a 6-μl final reaction volume containing 3 μl of 2x sybr green®  and 3 μm of each primer. real-time pcr reactions were run on the lightcycler®  <dig>  with an initial denaturation of 5 min at 95 °c followed by 50 cycles of 10 s at 95 °c, 30 s at 55 °c and 15 s at 72 °c. the pcr products were analyzed by melting curve analysis to verify the presence of a gene-specific pcr product and the absence of genomic dna contamination. the melting curve analysis was performed immediately after the pcr amplification using a single step at 95 °c for 1 min, 40 °c for 1 min and an annealing procedure starting at 65 °c to reach 95 °c with a time increment of  <dig>  °c/s. each reaction included negative and positive controls and each cdna sample was analyzed using two technical replicates. reactions showing difference in ct higher than one cycle between the two technical replicates were not considered in the analysis. the pcr efficiencies were determined with a dilution range of a pool of all cdna samples that was composed of seven data points . pcrs were run with two reference genes that are known to be stably expressed under the range of experimental conditions tested and have been previously used in apple: histoneh <dig> and α-actin  <cit> . transcript levels were calculated with the lightcycler®  <dig> software .

statistical analyses of qrt-pcr results were performed using r  <cit> . normalized transcript levels were analyzed by anova type iii, considering the treatment , date, tree, and bud nested in tree effects. the student’s t-test was performed to estimate the significance of the difference between ‘on’ and ‘off’ treatments at each date.

microarray analysis
the aryane_v <dig> microarray employed consists of  <dig>  probes corresponding to  <dig>  probes each replicated in the forward and reverse sense and including all the predicted genes from the ‘golden delicious’ apple genome sequence and controls  <cit> . probe length was 60 bp and probes were combined in a nimblegen microarray .

all spot comparisons were made between ‘on’  and ‘off’ trees at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . these time points were chosen to represent floral induction, floral bud initiation and the first steps of flower differentiation respectively for spur apical buds  <cit> . for each time point, total rna of two trees per treatment and three buds per tree and per date, corresponding to six separate rna extractions mixed in equal quantity, constituted a biological replicate . two independent biological replicates were performed with the ‘on’ and ‘off’ cdna clones labeled with cy <dig> and cy <dig> fluorescent dyes, respectively. a dye-swap was performed to eliminate any bias resulting from the two fluorescent dyes.

labeling of microarray samples, microarray hybridization, scanning, quantification, normalization  and analysis were performed as described in celton et al.  <cit> .

gene filtering and functional categorization
identification of transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed was performed using r  <cit>  as detailed in the procedure r available on github . only anti-sense probes, that hybridize sense transcripts, were considered in the analysis. transcripts with log difference higher than  <dig> or lower than − <dig> associated with a significant p-value  and probe specificity lower or equal to  <dig> were selected for further analysis. genes were then grouped depending on their expression profile. at each sampling date, each gene was tagged as “a” if its log <dig> ratio was less than − <dig>  “b” if its log <dig> ratio was more than  <dig> or “c” if it exhibited no differential expression. the  <dig> possible combinations of a, b and c  constituted  <dig> possible groups of genes. construction of venn diagrams was performed using the r function “draw.triple.venn” . functional categorization analyses were performed using arabidopsis thaliana genes homologous to apple transcripts present in the microarray, based on blast analysis against the tair database . functional classification of genes was made using the web tool agrigo  <cit> . first, gene ontology  was investigated for the whole subset of genes and then detailed date by date. secondly, to identify enriched go terms in the lists of differentially expressed genes at specific dates of the microarray analysis, singular enrichment analyses  were performed  <cit> . searches for protein interactions within gene sets were undertaken using string v <dig>   <cit> .

genomic position of genes and qtl
the genomic position of genes that showed significant differential expression for at least one of the three harvest dates was retrieved using the best hit reports of blastp of the malus x domestica genome v <dig>  proteins file  made available by the genome database for rosaceae .

previous studies based on a qtl detection approach in an apple segregating population, ‘starkrimson’ x ‘granny smith’ , identified eight genomic regions involved in control of biennial bearing and inflorescence yield  <cit> . positions of ssr markers used to detect qtl were retrieved either by blasting the marker sequence  available on the hidras database  to the apple reference genome  <cit> , or by using the genome database for rosaceae . for snp markers, the position of the gene prediction  used to design the marker  <cit>  was considered as the genomic position of the marker . qtl were defined between the two genetic markers flanking the qtl on the stk x gs integrated genetic map . since the chr <dig> qtl was detected at the very bottom of the linkage group and flanking markers exhibited inverted order between the genetic and the physical maps, in our analyses we considered the lower part of chr <dig>  below the ms06g <dig> genetic marker, as the qtl confidence interval.

RESULTS
evaluation of trees’ return to bloom
hand-thinned trees treated as ‘off’ in  <dig> massively induced flowers, with  <dig>  % of their buds being floral in  <dig> whereas  <dig>  % of the buds of ‘on’ trees remained vegetative . however,  <dig>  % of the buds of ‘on’ trees developed flowers in  <dig>  this percentage being on average lower than for the conventional thinned control trees . in ‘on’ and control trees, variation among trees was higher than among ‘off’ trees, characterized by a higher standard deviation .table  <dig> characterization of flowering intensity in  <dig> of apple trees bearing no crop , heavy crop  or conventional crop  in  <dig>  ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees labeled  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were used for mrna relative quantification by qrt-pcr, and trees labeled  <dig> to  <dig> were used for mrna microarray analyses

screening for expression of flowering genes by qrt-pcr and in the microarray
the expression profile of transcript levels of key flowering genes previously published in various apple cultivars were studied by qrt-pcr over five time points. this enabled us to compare our results with the literature, interpret the profiles based on the known function of these genes, and to choose three out of five time points available for microarray analyses.

specific and unique pcr-products were amplified for mdft <dig>  mdft <dig>  afl <dig>  afl <dig>  mdap1a, mdap1b, mdsoc1-like and mdtfl <dig>  which was confirmed by melting curve analyses and by sequencing of pcr amplicons . transcript levels were normalized against the mrna expression level of the reference gene histoneh <dig> of apple, which enabled us to compare our results with previous studies  <cit>  ; and similar profiles were confirmed using the α-actin reference gene . transcript levels of seven of these genes, afl <dig> and afl <dig>  mdap1a and mdap1b, mdft <dig> and mdft <dig>  and mdtfl <dig>  were used for microarray validation and revealed similar expression patterns with strong correlations .fig.  <dig> expression pattern of mdft <dig>  mdft <dig>  afl <dig>  afl <dig>  mdap1a, mdap1b, mdsoc1-like and mdtfl <dig> during the growing season in ‘gala’ apple trees measured by quantitative real-time pcr using spur apical buds harvested at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  graphics represent the average of the nine data points per date and per treatment with associated standard deviation. significance of the difference of relative expression between ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees for each studied gene and at each time point estimated by student t-test was reported on the graphics . relative expression was calculated using the histoneh <dig> housekeeping gene



flowering genes such as mdft <dig>  mdft <dig> and afl <dig> showed increasing transcript levels during the growing season but no significant differences in the expression pattern were observed between ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees . the relative expression profiles of mdsoc1-like  and afl <dig>  were similar, decreasing from day  <dig> to  <dig> and then slightly increasing up to day  <dig>  however, mdsoc1-like transcript levels of ‘off’ trees were above this tendency at day  <dig> and  <dig>  the difference between ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees was only significant at day  <dig> 

mdap1a and mdap1b exhibited similar expression patterns , as they were expressed at low level in the buds until day  <dig> and then significantly increased at day  <dig>  at this date, ‘off’ trees showed higher levels of transcript for both ap <dig> genes, the difference between the two treatments was not significant because of high standard error observed in ‘on’ trees, . mdtfl <dig>  had a contrasting profile as its expression decreased rapidly from day  <dig> and was very low at day  <dig>  transcript levels were higher in ‘on’ trees than in ‘off’ trees at day  <dig>  the difference was just below the significance threshold  .

finally, as the ft/tfl <dig> gene family is the main known flowering gene family in apple, we paid particular attention to these genes in the microarray. in the microarray experiment, both mdft <dig>  and mother of ft  expression levels increased between day  <dig>   <dig> and 222; however, no differential expression was observed between treatments. both tfl <dig> copies  exhibited the expected expression profile, with expression decreasing from day  <dig> to  <dig>  but without differential expression. neither mdft <dig> , brother of ft  nor tfl <dig>  showed significant differential expression in the microarray between treatments at any time point.

also, three apple homologous copies of soc <dig>  were not differentially expressed, their expression remained stable and constant  over time points. neither centroradialis  nor mother of ft  was expressed in the apical buds at any dates.

overview of genes differentially expressed in the microarray
among the  <dig>  probes targeting sense transcripts, only transcripts highly specific to the targeted gene  with log <dig> intensity higher than log =  <dig> above the background for at least one sample  were considered as positive for their expression. after the filtering procedure, a total of  <dig> transcripts were identified as significantly differentially expressed for at least one of the three time points, representing  <dig>  % of the sense genes targeted on the microarray. in the following, we reported mainly to genes up or down-regulated in ‘on’ trees, and mentioned the corresponding down and up-regulation in ‘off’ trees only when this was meaningful for gene interpretation.

the number of up-regulated  and down-regulated  transcripts in ‘on’ trees increased through time, with a number of up-regulated transcripts higher than of down-regulated transcripts . among these transcripts,  <dig> were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig>  whereas  <dig> were down-regulated trees. at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated and down-regulated in ‘on’ trees, respectively. at day  <dig>   <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees and  <dig> down-regulated. nine transcripts were consistently up-regulated in ‘on’ trees over the three dates,  <dig> transcripts were common to day  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> transcripts to day  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts to day  <dig> and  <dig>  only four transcripts were down-regulated in ‘on’ trees at both day  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> were common between day  <dig> and  <dig>  and one transcript was in common to day  <dig> and  <dig>  no genes in common were down-regulated during the time course of the experiment in ‘on’ trees. differential transcript profiles in apple buds from day  <dig> to  <dig> were visualized and transcripts that shared similar differential expression profiles were grouped into a user-defined number of  <dig> groups . among the  <dig> possible profiles described above, only  <dig> were observed. four groups contained  <dig> or  <dig> genes only and were therefore gathered with another group of similar profile . groups 1– <dig> contained transcripts up-regulated in apical buds of ‘on’ trees, whereas clusters 7– <dig> contained transcripts down-regulated.fig.  <dig> generalized venn diagram with three sets of transcripts at day  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  and their intersections for up-regulated genes between ‘on’  and ‘off’ ‘gala’ apple trees in  ‘on’ trees  and  ‘off’ trees 

fig.  <dig> gene expression profiles visualized in a user-defined number of  <dig> groups. at each sampling date, each gene was tagged as “a” if its log <dig> ratio was less than − <dig>  “b” if its log <dig> ratio was more than  <dig> or “c” if it exhibited no differential expression. groups are numbered 1– <dig> , and the total number of genes per set is noted into parentheses. for each diagram, the x-axis shows the three time points , while the y-axis corresponds to fold change in the set of genes. negative log <dig> ratio corresponds to transcripts up-regulated in trees inhibiting flowering , and positive log <dig> ratio corresponds to transcripts up-regulated in trees initiating flowering . the grey domain indicates the − <dig> and + <dig> limits used to filter gene expression



of the  <dig> transcripts differentially expressed in our experiment,  <dig> were homologous to an arabidopsis gene with a significant e-value, while the  <dig> remaining transcripts did not share significant homology with any arabidopsis gene. the  <dig> annotated apple transcripts corresponded to  <dig> unique arabidopsis genes.

single enrichment analysis  using agrigo showed that the ‘response to stimulus’ go  was the most significantly over represented in the subset of genes differentially expressed for at least one of the three time points. at day  <dig>  the genes with sequence homology to response to stimulus go including the response to abiotic stress, the response to stress and the cellular response to stimulus go were significantly up-regulated . at day  <dig>  four main biological processes were differentially expressed:  the response to stimulus, with the response to stress go being the most significant of the dataset  with, among others, the response to oxidative stress go ;  go belonging to cellular processes;  cell wall biogenesis  as part of the cellular component biogenesis go; and  metabolic processes, including the cellular carbohydrate biosynthetic process  and the lipid metabolic process  . at day  <dig>  the sea analysis showed that the response to stimulus was still the most significantly over-represented go , which included the response to gibberellin stimulus , the response to jasmonic acid stimulus  and the response to oxidative stress . in the developmental process go, which ends in anatomical structure development ,  <dig> transcripts were found to be differentially modulated between the two treatments. the metabolic process go included the carbohydrate biosynthetic process  and the transcription go  in which  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed between the treatments .

gde in metabolic processes suggest that apical buds of trees bearing a heavy crop are starved
among the nine transcripts up-regulated in ‘on’ trees over the three dates, five are homologous to genes involved in the response to stresses: asn <dig> , involved in cellular response to sucrose starvation, sen <dig> , a senescence-associated gene that is strongly induced by phosphate starvation, and mdp <dig>  a putative sugar phosphate exchanger .fig.  <dig> kinetics of the relative expression values  of transcripts differentially expressed involved in response to starvation , oxidoreductase activity  and hormonal regulation in response to stress  in apple spur apical buds between trees initiating flowering  and trees inhibiting flowering  at three developmental stages . the array data were normalized with the lowess method. normalized intensities  were then subtracted from the background. stars  indicate significant differences of expression between the two treatments

significant differences  between the two treatments were colored. light green indicate log² ratio values lower than  <dig> and dark green indicate values higher than  <dig>  light red indicate log² ratio values higher than - <dig> and dark red indicate values lower than - <dig> 



one transcript homologous to lpr <dig>  involved in cellular response to phosphate starvation was found to be over-expressed in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig>  at this same date, primary carbohydrate metabolism in apical buds of ‘on’ trees was oriented towards gluconeogenesis as indicated by the up-regulation of four homologous copies of pck <dig> . two homologous transcripts involved in carbon utilization ca <dig> and ca <dig> , and four glutaredoxin family proteins homologs  involved in the cellular homosteasis go were also up-regulated in ‘on’ trees. we also noticed a transcript homologous to atmt <dig>  participating in cellular copper ion homeostasis, known to be involved in the response to fructose stimulus, growth and in the positive regulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic process as well as a transcript homologous to sag <dig> , which encodes an acyl hydrolase involved in senescence, even though both these transcripts had relatively low percentage of homology, 50 % and 38 %, respectively .

among transcripts that were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig>  we particularly note mdp <dig>  a homolog of bmy <dig> coding for a beta-amylase, and mdp <dig>  a homolog of atphs <dig> coding for an alpha-glucan phosphorylase, both involved in starch degradation. at the same time, transcripts coding for a beta-fructosidase bfruct <dig> homolog  and sucrose-phosphate synthase atsps4f  were down and up-regulated, respectively. in addition, galactinol synthase homologs involved in the carbohydrate biosynthetic process  and a mannose 6-phosphate reductase homolog  were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees .

apical buds of trees bearing a heavy crop are in unfavorable cellular redox status
the oxidoreductase molecular function was significantly over-represented, with eight,  <dig> and  <dig> genes up-regulated at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this indicates that the reduction of oxygenized molecules was active over the three time points of the experiment. one transcript particularly relevant to the cellular redox status, homologous to oxs <dig> , which is involved in the tolerance to oxidative stress , was up-regulated in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig> and  <dig> .fig.  <dig> kinetics of the relative expression values  of transcripts differentially expressed involved in response to oxidative stress , cellular components biogenesis  and meristem fate and floral transition  in apple spur apical buds between trees initiating flowering  and trees inhibiting flowering  at three developmental stages . the array data were normalized with the lowess method. normalized intensities  were then subtracted from the background. stars  indicate significant differences of expression between the two treatments



transcripts involved in the oxidoreductase activity and the catalytic activity go, which were both significantly over-represented, were down-regulated at day  <dig> in apical buds of ‘on’ trees . five homologous copies of at1g <dig>  a quinone oxidoreductase-like protein, possibly involved in detoxification of reactive carbonyls, were found in the transcript set. genes belonging to the sulfate reduction and assimilation go were also down-regulated in ‘on’ trees. organic sulfur compounds, such as thiols, sulfolipids, glucosinolates or alliins, are known to play important roles in the normal plant lifecycle and in protection against stress and pathogens. homologs of apr <dig> and apr <dig>  which encode key enzymes of the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway and for which a decrease in enzyme activity leads to sulfate accumulation in the plant, were down-regulated in ‘on’ trees for the three time points . however, the difference was only statistically significant at day  <dig> for the homolog of apr <dig> and at day  <dig> and  <dig> for apr <dig> homolog. two homologous copies of atsdi <dig> , which has a role in the regulation of stored sulfate pools and is induced by sulfur starvation, were down-regulated in ‘on’ trees at both day  <dig> and  <dig> . another homologous copy of atsdi <dig>  was down-regulated in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig> only. finally, three transcripts homologous to mif <dig> , an oxidoreductase involved in multiple hormonal regulation, were up-regulated at day  <dig> in apical buds of ‘on’ trees as well as a transcript homologous to sro <dig> , a gene involved in the oxygen and reactive oxygen species metabolic process, which was up-regulated at day  <dig> .

gde involved in hormonal regulation
at day  <dig>   <dig> transcripts homologous to genes involved in hormonal regulation in response to stress were up-regulated in apical buds of ‘on’ trees, among them: rd <dig> , involved in response to abscisic acid stimulus; abr <dig> , a member of the ethylene response factor  subfamily involved in regulation of aba-mediated stress response; athb- <dig> , involved in abscisic acid-mediated signaling and response to abscisic acid stimulus. four homologous transcripts were also involved in response to ethylene: jmt , which catalyzes the formation of methyljasmonate from jasmonic acid; and bee <dig> , a transcription factor induced by brassinosteroid, auxin and ethylene, and repressed by abscisic acid; erf <dig>  . moreover, six leucine-rich-repeat  receptor-like transcripts were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees, in particular mdp <dig>  mdp <dig>  mdp <dig> and mdp <dig> at day  <dig>  mdp <dig> at day  <dig>  and mdp <dig> at day  <dig> and  <dig> . these lrr proteins are known to be involved in protein amino acid phosphorylation, which is one of the most important and frequent regulation mechanisms in plants.

at day  <dig>  two transcripts homologous to ga2ox  and one homolog of ga20ox  were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees. we also noted brc <dig> , a transcription factor indirectly required for the auxin-induced control of apical dominance and known to arrest axillary bud development, prevent axillary bud outgrowth and delay early axillary bud development, along with br6ox <dig> , which encodes a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme that catalyzes the last reaction in the production of brassinolides which regulate the plant growth and productivity, and are known to alleviate various biotic and abiotic stress effects.

snak <dig> homologs coding for proteins involved in responses to gibberellin stimulus were down-regulated at day  <dig> . in the developmental process go, in addition to brc <dig> previously mentioned, another transcript homologous to a major gene involved in branching control was up-regulated in ‘on’ trees, max <dig> . this gene is a specific repressor of vegetative axillary buds generated by the axillary bud, known to be involved in the regulation of meristem organization, positive regulation of flavonoid biosynthetic process, carotenoid biosynthetic process, secondary shoot formation and auxin polar transport .

floral repressor transcripts are up-regulated in apical buds of trees bearing a heavy crop, whereas floral enhancer transcripts are up-regulated in defruited trees
among transcripts involved in the flowering time pathway, mdp <dig> which shares  <dig>  % of homology with tem <dig>  in malus x domestica whole genome v <dig>  was found significantly up-regulated in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig> . tem <dig> is known as a floral repressor possibly linked to the photoperiod and ga-dependent flowering pathways. also, two homologous copies of the transcription factor no apical meristem   were up-regulated in trees inhibiting floral induction  at day  <dig>  this transcription factor belongs to the nac protein family which is involved in various plant developmental processes such as sam development and stress inducible floral induction. the transcription factor knat <dig> , known to be expressed in mid-meristem to promote leaf fate, was also up-regulated at day  <dig> in sam of ‘on’ trees.

two other homologous transcripts of interest were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees, maf <dig>  and prr <dig> , but at day  <dig> only. in arabidopsis, maf <dig> is known to be homologous to flowering locus c and m , which are repressors of flowering and major determinants of natural flowering time variation in response to cold temperatures whereas prr <dig> encodes components involved in a negative feedback loop in the circadian clock in arabidopsis thaliana and could be a floral inhibitor.

furthermore, one homologous copy of ftm <dig>  coding for a stearoyl-acp desaturase was down-regulated in ‘on’ trees at both day  <dig> and  <dig>  and therefore up-regulated in ‘off’ trees . three transcripts sharing homology with spl  family members were also down-regulated in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig> , spl <dig>  and spl <dig>  . in arabidopsis, these transcripts are known to be involved in the vegetative to reproductive phase transition and flowering regulation. expression of both spl <dig> and spl <dig> is regulated by the microrna mir <dig>  however, in our experiment mir <dig> did not showed differential expression between the two treatments .

apical buds of defruited trees are under active biogenesis at day  <dig> and 222
the sea analysis indicated that cell wall biosynthesis go, and metabolic processes including the cellular carbohydrate biosynthetic process and the lipid metabolic process were significantly up-regulated in ‘off’ trees . furthermore, processes linked to cellular processes and cellular component biogenesis ending in cell wall biogenesis were also up-regulated, consistently with an increased cellular activity and meristem re-organization activity in trees initiating flowering . transcripts homologous to arabidopsis members of the cellulose synthase family involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis: irx <dig> , irx <dig> , irx <dig>  and irx <dig> , along with the cellulose synthase a  <dig>  and cesa <dig>  were up-regulated in ‘off’ trees at day  <dig> and  <dig>  except irx <dig>  which was not significantly up-regulated at day  <dig> .

distribution of differentially expressed genes on the genome and co-localization with qtl for biennial bearing
of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes in our experiment,  <dig> genes were positioned on one of the  <dig> chromosomes of the apple genome . these were evenly distributed over the  <dig>  mb of the genome, with on average one gene every  <dig>  mb .

in total,  <dig> genes were located within the eight qtl regions linked to the control of biennial bearing in a ‘starkrimson’ x ‘granny smith’ segregating population  <cit> . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were annotated . the sea analysis showed that the oxidoreductase activity was over-represented with eight genes . transcripts with sequence homology to seven leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein kinases that were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees were located within qtls: mdp <dig> , mdp <dig>  mdp <dig>  mdp <dig> and mdp <dig> , mdp <dig> , mdp <dig> .

besides genes encoding a catalytic activity, genes involved in hormone stimulus response and plant developmental processes were located within qtls. within the chromosome  <dig> qtl interval, two copies homologous to a gene involved in the response to gibberellin stimulus  were down-regulated in trees bearing heavy crop  at day  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  the transcriptional regulator spl <dig>  involved in the vegetative to reproductive phase transition was down-regulated in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig>  in the qtl interval for inflorescence production , one transcript homologous to the transcription factor no apical meristem   was up-regulated in ‘on’ trees at day  <dig> 

discussion
the defruiting treatment significantly induced flowers in apical buds of ‘off’ trees
the deflowering treatment that was applied to the trees proved effective in raising the amount of fi in the following spring. trees induced to the ‘off’ state by removing all flowers at full bloom flowered heavily in the subsequent year, with more than 90 % of their buds producing inflorescences, with a low variance among treated trees. in contrast, heavy fruit load  had a lower fi than the conventionally thinned trees used as controls. however, a proportion of buds  were induced to flower in the ‘on’ trees, probably because of the tendency of ‘gala’ to bear regularly  <cit> . it is likely that cultivars with a more severe biennial bearing tendency than ‘gala’ might bear less after an ‘on’ year. however, cultivars even prone to be regular can be pushed to irregularity by manipulations as shown by  <dig>  % of the buds of ‘on’ not-thinned trees that remained vegetative. moreover, the high variability observed in ‘on’ and control trees demonstrates that bud fate is heterogeneous and desynchronized within a tree, contrasting to the high degree of synchronism among apical buds observed in ‘off’ trees where flowers had been removed in the preceding year. the tendency to sam synchronization versus desynchronization has been proposed to be genotype dependent  <cit> .

expression pattern of flowering genes as molecular markers of transition in apical buds
flowering gene expression was studied using qrt-pcr during the critical phases of bud fate, from day 118– <dig>  this period being assumed to include fi, transition to inflorescence meristem and early beginning of floral differentiation  <cit> . because there is no single and obvious marker of fi in sam of apple, we used qrt-pcr to study the expression patterns of key flowering genes. our results are consistent with those of previous studies, especially for mdft <dig>  mdsoc1-like, afl <dig> and afl <dig> which exhibited similar expression patterns, although with lower levels of expression and less contrast between dates than those observed by hättasch et al.  <cit> . in particular, we did not observe expression peaks of mdtfl <dig> at day  <dig>  expression profiles of mdtfl <dig>  mdft <dig> and mdft <dig>  and mdap <dig> were similar to those observed by kotoda et al.  <cit> , but again with less contrast between dates. the differences observed among the studies might be due to different normalization of the transcript level , or to the different environments in which the trees were grown and to the use of different cultivars.

ap <dig> has been proposed as a molecular marker for flowering differentiation in eucalyptus . in arabidopsis, the mode of action of ap <dig> is dynamic, since it acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor during the earliest stages of flower development; however, it activates regulatory genes required for floral organ formation at more advanced stages  <cit> . ap1’s role in floral organ formation has also been confirmed in apple  <cit> . in our qrt-pcr, the high expression of mdap1a at day  <dig> in ‘on’ trees might be interpreted as being related to its transcriptional repressor activity on fi, whereas the high expression levels of both mdpa1a and mdap1b in the same trees after day  <dig> suggest that floral differentiation occurred after this date. similarly, the lower expression of mdap1a and mdap1b at day  <dig> in ‘on’ buds compared with that in ‘off’ buds may reflect the lower rate of fi in these buds. the lack of significant differential expression of mdap <dig> in the microarray may result from a mix of flowering and not-flowering buds and to the relatively early date considering the timing of flower differentiation that is assumed to occur between day  <dig> and day  <dig>  <cit> . the concomitant down-regulation of mdtfl <dig> from day  <dig> is also consistent with previous studies showing that in apple, as in arabidopsis, tfl <dig> represses ap <dig> expression  <cit> . the late expression of mdpi, enhanced by mdap <dig>  has been related to the development of floral organs in apple  <cit> , which is consistent with the very low expression of mdpi detected at day  <dig> only . this also suggests that the formation of floral whorls began around day  <dig> and that mdpi expression increases later in the season. the qrt-pcr profiles developed for key flowering genes, together with previous studies that have determined the timing of fi in apple  <cit> , led us to choose three time points for the microarray analysis to represent the period of fi , floral bud initiation  and the beginning of flower differentiation . these three time points are the most likely to pinpoint some important mechanisms of biennial bearing and highlight differences between ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees.

moreover, the transcript levels of afl <dig> and afl <dig>  mdap1a and mdap1b, mdft <dig> and mdft <dig>  and mdtfl <dig>  were highly correlated between qrt-pcr and microarray, and were considered as a validation of the microarray results.

triggering fi in apical buds of adult apple trees: a number of candidate processes
the results of the microarray analysis suggest that a number of processes could be involved in fi in apical buds of adult apple trees. indeed, positioning the major genes differentially expressed in buds sampled in ‘on’ or ‘off’ trees in the pathways described in the literature as controlling fi in model plants suggest that several of these pathways could be involved in fi triggering in adult apple trees. many authors have previously underlined the multifactorial nature of fi in plants, with accelerated flowering in response to shade, drought, low nutrients, decreased light quality, heat and general oxidative stress  <cit> . in perennial tropical trees, in absence of cold temperatures, fi can be triggered by water stress or other stressful practices  <cit> .

starvation and unfavorable redox status in apical buds of trees bearing heavy crop
in this experiment, apical buds of ‘on’ trees exhibited differential expression in transcripts involved in metabolic processes, which suggest that they could be starved and under oxidative stress . depletion in carbohydrate supply in apical buds, which is one of the earliest observed events, is likely to result from high crop load. even though the presence of fruit has been shown to enhance photosynthesis in adjacent leaves  <cit> , the competition for carbohydrates between vegetative and reproductive growth is a well-known and documented phenomenon  <cit> . the necessary balance between vegetative and reproductive growth, as well as the requirement for a minimum number of leaves for fruit set and development to take place, was suggested by huet  <cit>  and nielsen and dennis  <cit> , who demonstrated that the fi rate increases with the number of leaves associated with the bourse in apple and pear. however, if the autonomous pathway is described as the number of leaves necessary to induce flowering  <cit> , it will be almost impossible to distinguish this effect from that of carbohydrate availability due to the corresponding photosynthetic activity of leaves. the source/sink relationships and genetic control of precise cell territories will need further investigation to explain the diversity of bud fates and topology that are observed at a more integrated plant scale  <cit> .fig.  <dig> main metabolic, hormonal and redox status regulations revealed by microarray analyses comparing differentially expressed transcripts in apical buds of spurs sampled on adult ‘gala’ apple trees, between ‘on’  and ‘off’  trees. in apical buds of ‘on’ trees, more likely to be in vegetative state, transcripts highlighted responses to stresses such as starvation for sucrose and phosphates, stress hormonal signaling and down-regulated cell detoxification processes, whereas transcripts homologous to genes known as repressor of flowering induction  and involved in sam maintenance in the vegetative state  were up-regulated. in apical buds of ‘off’ trees, more likely to be induced to flower, transcripts showed active cell biogenesis and detoxification, with several promoters of floral induction  up-regulated. timing and transitions stages from vegetative state  to domed meristem  and floral meristem , as defined by foster et al.  <cit>  are exemplified by photos of histological longitudinal sections in apical buds of ‘gala’ apple trees



in addition, the influence of carbohydrate allocation to the development of specific tissues or organs could also preside over “go/no go” decisions such as organ drop, sam death or fi triggering. indeed, carbohydrates are considered not only as nutrients but also as signaling molecules  <cit> , and the signaling role of starch and sucrose metabolism in fi has been proposed for a long time  <cit> . in our study, there was no evidence of a differential expression of transcripts involved in primary carbohydrate metabolism between apical buds of ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees; however, large differences in expression were identified in genes encoding enzymes that control secondary metabolism, including phosphatase-reductases, glycosyl-transferases, cellulose synthases, which were all down-regulated in apical buds of ‘on’ trees. this suggests that, even though active photosynthesis can be assumed in ‘on’ trees bearing heavy crop, carbon may not be enough available to apical tissues, and could lead to local carbon depletion and reduced cellular activity. indeed, the maintenance of cell division and differentiation has been shown to generate a strong carbohydrate requirement in sam  <cit> . the up-regulation in ‘on’ trees of two transcription factors involved in sam maintenance  is consistent with this assumption. knat <dig>  a member of the knox family  <cit>  and nam  <cit> , which is involved in the sam constitution during embryogenesis, are both involved in sam patterning and prevent meristematic cell differentiation. therefore their up-regulation in ‘on’ trees is consistent with a reduction in carbon demand, fi inhibition and maintenance of vegetative fate in sam. moreover, two genes known to be involved in the control of axillary bud, max <dig> and brc <dig>  were also up-regulated in ‘on’ trees. the up-regulation of max <dig>  which is an inhibitor of am development and branching  <cit>  is consistent with antagonism between vegetative growth and fruit load. brc <dig>  a homologue of the maize teosinte branched <dig>  is also known to be involved in control of axillary branching  <cit> . interestingly, brc <dig> has been also shown to interact with ft and tfl <dig> in arabidopsis during the floral transition of axillary meristems  <cit> .

the link between nutritional and redox status is known to be mediated by the circadian clock that enables daily regulation of cell metabolism, energy balance and redox status  <cit> . in our study, several genes involved in the control of oxidative stress tolerance, cellular ion homeostasis, cellular redox status and senescence were up-regulated in apical buds of ‘on’ trees. this suggests that ros could accumulate in these buds. in arabidopsis, the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase has been associated with enhanced accumulation of oxidized proteins  <cit>  and a mutant lacking thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase and cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase <dig> exhibited an early bolting phenotype  <cit> . it has thus been suggested that plants subjected to stress flower earlier and that there might be a commensurate response to stress intensity, stepping up from a strategy based on tolerating the effects of stress, for instance through oxs expression, to stress escape via reproduction  <cit> . however, depending on the species both delayed and early flowering have been observed under stress conditions and the decision on fi triggering may differ between annual and perennial plants. further characterization of the putative link between cell redox status in sam and flowering could contribute to deciphering the physiological mechanisms involved in fi in adult apple trees.

the hormones could contribute to the decision to flower
the hormonal responses differentially expressed between ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees appeared consistent with the nutritional and oxidative stress perceived by apical buds in ‘on’ trees compared with that in ‘off’ trees. in particular, the redox hub activity is linked to hormonal signaling and results in plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. for instance, in addition to its antioxidant function, ascorbic acid is required for the biosynthesis of the plant hormones abscisic acid, ga, and ethylene  <cit> . moreover, low amounts of ascorbic acid promote the accumulation of the phytoalexin camalexin  <cit>  as well as salicylic acid  <cit>  and this has been demonstrated to influence flowering time  <cit> . as genes and transcription factors induced by brassinosteroid and auxin were also differentially expressed in our study, most hormonal functions were differentially oriented between ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees.

among them, ga biosynthesis represents the strongest candidate function for its direct involvement in the regulation of flowering control in apple, even though the roles of the different forms of ga have not so far been elucidated. application of ga to apple trees has showed that ga <dig> has the most inhibitory effect on fi  <cit> , and horticultural practices commonly involve the application of ga during ‘off’ years to prevent an excessive fi and thus attenuate the biennial bearing cycle  <cit> . hence, bioactive gas appear to have an inhibitory effect on key flowering genes/steps in apple, and are considered to have an opposite effect on fi in perennial plants, compared with their role in annual plants  <cit> . it is noteworthy that in our study several differentially expressed transcripts involved in the ga biosynthesis pathway were identified in qtl cluster intervals that control tree production and alternation: mdga20ox1a and mdga3ox-like-b on lg <dig> and mdga2ox8a on lg <dig>  <cit> . in addition, two copies of ga2ox and one copy of ga20ox, which contribute to catabolism and metabolism of active ga forms, respectively, were up-regulated in apical buds of ‘on’ trees. these results reinforce the assumption that, in apple, bioactive gas may play a role in the control of key flowering genes/steps.

putative flowering genes and floral repressors involved in fi in adult apple trees
transcripts with sequence homology to major genes known as key actors in control of fi were differentially expressed in apical buds of adult apple trees: two were floral repressors  that were up-regulated in ‘on’ trees, whereas genes enhancing flowering such as spl genes were up-regulated in ‘off’ trees.

in our experiment, tem <dig> was up-regulated in ‘on’ trees at both day  <dig> and  <dig>  this gene belongs to the complex rav family of transcription factors  <cit> , in which there may be functional redundancy, since both tem <dig> and tem <dig> act as direct repressors of the ft gene. tem <dig> transcription is induced when leaf senescence is accelerated by phytohormones such as ethylene or methyl jasmonate  <cit>  and tem <dig> has been described as an integrator of different flowering pathways   <cit> . tem <dig> has been shown to be expressed in vascular and mesophyll tissues in leaves although the levels and spatial distribution change through development  <cit> . in the present study, we found that tem <dig> is expressed in apical buds at early stages after full bloom  and with differential expression levels consistent with an inhibitory role on fi in ‘on’ trees. as tem <dig> and tem <dig> exhibit a circadian-clock dependent expression profile with a maximum at midafternoon  <cit> , further investigations on the diurnal pattern of tem <dig> expression in apple tree apical buds should be performed before drawing any conclusions.

up-regulation in ‘on’ trees of the transcription factor maf <dig> , which belongs to a large mads-box family of flowering repressors was found, but at day  <dig> only, i.e. after the normal fi period. in arabidopsis, maf <dig> is known to be homologous to flowering locus c and m  and to be involved in the vernalization pathway and in the adaptation of flowering time of arabidopsis thaliana to cold temperatures  <cit> . since flc and flc-like transcription factors have been reported to be up-regulated by oxidized glutathione  <cit> , the late expression of maf <dig> could result from the redox status in apical buds of ‘on’ trees. similarly, the differential expression of the pseudo response regulator  protein prr <dig>  which was observed in this experiment and which is known to encode components of the circadian clock in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  might be linked to the daily cellular detoxification and regulation of redox status. however, these suggestions will need further investigations.

other putative actors in our system were squamosa promoter binding-like  transcription factors. in arabidopsis, expression of both spl <dig> and spl <dig> is regulated by the microrna mir <dig>  however, in our experiment mir <dig> did not show differential expression between ‘on’ and ‘off’ trees, consistently with the up-regulation of spl-like genes found in citrus without differential expression of mir <dig>  <cit> . however, the role of mir <dig> in floral induction will need further investigations since mir <dig> abundance is reduced with plant age and is associated with vegetative phase transition in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in our data, spl <dig> and spl <dig> were up-regulated in ‘off’ trees at day  <dig> only and had similar expression patterns to those of mdap1a and mdap1b. this could be in line with spl <dig> role in promoting the expression of ap <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> , but as a late event in the fi process. interestingly, recent results highlighted interactions between ga and spl transcription factors in sam of arabidopsis thaliana under long days  <cit> . these authors showed that ga is required in vascular tissues to increase the levels of ft and twin sister of ft  mrnas which encode a systemic signal transported from the leaves to sam during fi. they suggest that ga might have spatially separated functions between leaves and sam since ga could facilitate the activation of ft in leaves and spl genes in the meristem. in addition, torti et al.  <cit>  described a ft-independent pathway, in which ftm <dig> was expressed in sam under long days. our results could be consistent with this scheme, since ftm <dig> transcript was differentially expressed at the time of floral bud initiation  and afterwards, until flower meristem differentiation . even though it is impossible to speculate on ft involvement in fi triggering since leaves were not considered in this experiment and despite short vegetative phase , which could be suspected to be present, was not differentially expressed in the microarray, several major genes were present and differentially expressed in apical buds between ‘on’ and ‘off’ apple trees: ga2ox, ftm <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the transcripts differentially expressed between inductive  and non-inductive  conditions in adult apple trees suggests that different flowering pathways could be involved in the control of fi in adult apple trees. changes in the nutritional and redox status could be part of the autonomous pathway, whereas ga  and circadian clock  and ambient temperature  pathways could be involved as well. the main hypothesis emerging from our results is that unfavorable redox and nutritional status of buds could induce hormonal response that may in turn activate key regulators of meristem fate. however, at that stage causes and effects cannot be inferred from the data. in addition, we found that key regulators of stress signaling  and of meristem transition in arabidopsis thaliana  were present in qtl intervals for traits linked to biennial bearing in apple. studying allelic diversity of the apple tree genes and comparing them to the phenotypic behavior can yield powerful tools for use in breeding regular varieties using molecular markers.
