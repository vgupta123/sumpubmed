BACKGROUND
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli , also called verocytotoxin-producing e. coli , have emerged as pathogens that can cause food-borne infections and severe and potentially fatal illnesses in humans, such as haemorrhagic colitis  and haemolytic uraemic syndrome . stec strains that cause human infections belong to a large number of o:h serotypes. certain stec strains belonging to serotypes o26:h <dig>  o103:h <dig>  o111:h <dig>  o145:h <dig>  and o157:h <dig> have been more frequently isolated from humans with severe illnesses. furthermore, most outbreaks of hc and hus have been attributed to strains of the enterohemorrhagic serotype o157:h <dig>  however, as non-o <dig> stec are more prevalent in animals and are food contaminants, humans are probably more exposed to these strains  <cit> . in spain, stec represent a significant cause of sporadic cases of human infection  <cit> . stec isolates have caused eight outbreaks in spain: six produced by the serotype o157:h <dig> , one by the serotype o26:h <dig>  and one by the serotype o111:h- <cit> .

pathogenicity of stec is associated with various virulence factors. the main factor is the capacity to form two potent phage-encoded cytotoxins called shiga-toxins  or verocytotoxins   <cit> . in addition to toxin production, another virulence-associated factor expressed by stec is a protein called intimin encoded by the eae gene and responsible for intimate attachment of stec to the intestinal epithelial cells, and which causes attaching and effacing  lesions in the intestinal mucosa  <cit> . the association between infections with intimin-positive stec and severe illnesses in humans was demonstrated previously, but it was also shown that intimin is not essential for the virulence of certain stec strains. at present,  <dig>  types and subtypes of intimins encoding in the eae gene have been identified  <cit> . it is discussed that different intimins may be responsible for different host- and tissue cell tropism  <cit> . a factor that may also affect virulence of stec is the enterohemolysin , also called enterohemorrhagic e. coli haemolysin , encoded by the ehxa gene  <cit> .

ruminants, and especially cattle, represent one of the largest reservoirs of stec, undercooked minced beef and raw milk being the major vehicles of stec outbreaks  <cit> . the results of our previous studies indicated that stec colonization is widespread among cattle in spain. between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>  healthy cattle were examined for stec colonization. stec-positive animals were found in 95% of the farms examined and the estimated proportion of positive cattle in each farm ranged from  <dig> to 100%. the overall prevalence rates of non-o <dig> stec colonization were estimated to be 37% in calves and 27% in cows. in a survey between  <dig> and  <dig>  stec o157:h <dig> was isolated from  <dig>  of  <dig> feedlot calves . although only a mean of three animals per herd were sampled, stec o157:h <dig> isolates were detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig> feedlots examined  <cit> .

our current investigation is the first large study in spain on prevalence of stec o <dig> and non-o <dig> in raw beef products. in view of the increasing importance of stec as emerging food-borne pathogens, the high stec prevalence in cattle and the lack of data from stec isolated from food in spain, the objective of this study were to determine the prevalence of stec o157:h <dig> and non-o <dig> in a large sampling of minced beef collected from  <dig> local stores in lugo city between  <dig> and  <dig>  another objective was to establish the serotypes, virulence genes and intimin types of those stec isolated from minced beef to determine their potential pathogenicity to humans.

RESULTS
in the present study stec were detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig> minced beef samples collected. stec o157:h <dig> was isolated from eight  samples and non-o <dig> stec were isolated from  <dig>  . in three samples, both stec o157:h <dig> and non-o <dig>  were isolated. the best results for detection and isolation of stec were obtained when the cells were plated onto cefixime tellurite sorbitol macconkey  agar  and macconkey  agar . the highest prevalence of stec was detected in the samples with higher level of fecal contamination. thus, stec were detected in 33% of minced beef samples with more than  <dig> e. coli per gramme .

the comparison of data on stec prevalence in food is subject to certain limitations. first, the use of different sampling methods on different types of products. second, protocols for isolation and detection of these pathogens vary and are not uniform among and within laboratories. third, most studies are focused on o157:h <dig>  and thus underestimate stec prevalence by ignoring the presence of non-o <dig> stec. in any case, figures found in our laboratory do not differ greatly from those reported abroad  with studies carried out on the prevalence of both o <dig> and non-o <dig> stec in minced beef  <cit> . higher prevalences were reported in other countries . thus, three main studies were carried out in washington state with prevalences of 23%  <cit> , 17%  <cit> , and a quite different 1%  <cit> . in argentina, parma et al.  <cit>  detected a prevalence of 30% in  <dig> minced beef samples. in india, khan et al.  <cit>  found 50% of  <dig> minced beef samples positive for stx by pcr.

in our study stec o157:h <dig> was isolated from eight  samples. a similar prevalence was detected in different countries: 1% and  <dig> % in united kingdom  <cit> ; 1% in the netherlands  <cit> ;  <dig> % and 2% in italy  <cit> ;  <dig> % in czeck republic  <cit> . in usa, prevalences reported varied from 0%  <cit> ,  <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig> %  <cit> . higher prevalences were detected in argentina  <dig> %  <cit> , china 5%  <cit> , perú 19%  <cit> , and in canada, with two studies of 2% and 29% of prevalence, respectively  <cit> .

analyzing table  <dig>  we can appreciate a longitudinal maintenance of the prevalence of non-o <dig> stec in minced beef samples, with a decline prevalence occurred during  <dig>  however, it should be considered that only  <dig> samples were analysed during this year. the same happens with stec o157:h <dig>  whose prevalence fluctuates from 0% to  <dig> %, with the exception of  <dig>  when it increased to 5%. the present study comprises data from  <dig> to  <dig>  and data from this longitudinal period does not reflect any control measures to reduce contamination in raw minced beef sold in different stores from lugo.

stec strains that cause human infections belong to a large number of o:h serotypes , o91:h <dig> or h-, o103:h <dig>  o111:h-, o113:h <dig>  o117:h <dig>  o118:h <dig>  o121:h <dig>  o128:h <dig> or h-, o145:h <dig> or h- and o146:h <dig> are frequently associated with severe illnesses in humans, but the role of other non-o <dig> stec types in human illnesses needs further examination  <cit> .

in the present study we have characterized  <dig> stec isolates . these isolates belonged to  <dig> o serogroups,  <dig> o:h serotypes . the majority  of stec isolates belonged to serotypes previously found in human stec and 38% to serotypes   associated with stec isolated from patients with hus. by pcr the  <dig> stec isolates showed that  <dig>  carried stx <dig> genes,  <dig>  stx <dig>  and  <dig>  both stx <dig> and stx <dig>  enterohemolysin  and intimin  virulence genes were detected in  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the isolates, respectively. a total of  <dig> different seropathotypes  were detected, being seropathotype o157:h <dig> stx1stx2eae-γ <dig> ehxa the most common , followed by o8:h <dig> stx <dig> and ont:h <dig> stx <dig> , o26:h <dig> stx1eae-β <dig> ehxa, and o64:h <dig> stx <dig> . like other authors  <cit> , we have observed that stec isolated from beef and human stec of the same serotype have similar known virulence-associated properties.

at least  <dig> phage types have been reported for stec o157:h <dig>  <cit>  but only seven of these  accounted for the majority  of the human strains isolated in europe and canada  <cit> . phage types pt <dig> and pt <dig> were predominant in human stec o157:h <dig> strains in spain as well as in many other european countries, including belgium, finland, germany, italy, england and scotland; whereas pt <dig> was the most frequently isolated in canada. six different phage types were detected among the eight o157:h <dig> strains isolated in this study: pt <dig> and pt <dig> ; pt21/ <dig>  pt <dig>  pt <dig>  pt atypical . interestingly, seven of those eight isolates belonged to the most common phage types associated with severe human illnesses in europe and canada  <cit> .

the eae gene, which has been shown to be necessary for attaching and effacing activity, encodes a 94- to 97-kda outer membrane protein  which is termed intimin  <cit> . numerous investigators have underlined the strong association between the carriage of eae gene and the capacity of stec strains to cause severe human illnesses, especially hus  <cit> . this important virulence gene was detected in 100% of stec o157:h <dig> and in 19% of non-o <dig> isolates from beef in the present study. nevertheless, production of intimin is not essential for pathogenesis, because a number of sporadic cases of hus have been caused by eae-negative non-o <dig> stec strains. thus, stec o104:h <dig> and o113:h <dig> strains lacking eae gene were responsible for an outbreak and a cluster of three hus cases in usa and australia, respectively  <cit> .

differentiation of intimin alleles represents an important tool for stec typing in routine diagnostics as well as in pathogenesis, epidemiological, clonal and immunological studies  <cit> . the c-terminal end of intimin is responsible for receptor binding, and it has been suggested that different intimins may be responsible for different host tissue cell tropism. the 5'regions of eae genes are conserved, whereas the 3'regions are heterogeneous. this observation led to the construction of universal pcr primers and allele-specific pcr primers, which has made possible to differentiate at present  <dig> variants of the eae gene encoding  <dig> different intimin types and subtypes   <cit> . in this study, four eae variants were differentiated: γ <dig> , β <dig> , ε <dig> , and θ .

CONCLUSIONS
seropathotypes o26:h <dig> stx <dig> eae-β <dig>  o157:h <dig> stx <dig> stx <dig> eae-γ <dig> and o157:h <dig> stx <dig> eae-γ <dig> are the most frequently observed in stec that cause human infections in spain  <cit> . these highly virulent seropathotypes were detected in  <dig> of  <dig> stec isolates characterized in the present study, confirming minced beef as potential source of stec isolates pathogenic for humans and reinforces the need of haccp  programs all through food chain, from abattoirs to markets, in order to reduce contamination and consequently, illnesses related to minced beef. in addition, consumers should reduce their risk for stec foodborne illnesses by following safe food-handling recommendations and by avoiding consumption of raw or undercooked meat products.
