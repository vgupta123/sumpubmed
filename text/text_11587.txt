BACKGROUND
three crops account for over 60% of all food calories grown in the world; wheat , rice  and maize  with thirty crops in all accounting for around 95% of total calories consumed  <cit> . this over-dependence on a limited number of major crops has narrowed the genetic and species base of agriculture. growing monocultures of crop genotypes selected to respond to intensive inputs potentially makes major crops more vulnerable to pest and diseases and can lead them to perform poorly in low input systems. exploring the potentials of underutilised and minor crops to contribute to agricultural biodiversity may also help agricultural production to cope with the effects of climate change, through improving the resilience of future agricultural systems, using crops that have been selected in-field for millennia under low input agriculture.

underutilised and minor crops often have limited research or development funding with little or no interest from commercial seed companies. limited resource is often a major challenge in expediting the improvement of any promising underutilised crops through marker-assisted breeding programmes. the ability to translate trait information from model and major crops species to underutilised crops is important to be able to fully exploit available resources, effectively developing research simultaneously into a complex of species, rather than a single species in isolation. working with species complexes also allows important insights into genetic networks responsible for performance and environmental responses in the context of evolutionary relationships and ecological differences in these crops and their progenitors.

bambara groundnut  is widely grown as a plant protein source for poor farmers, particularly in sub-saharan africa with the seeds containing good levels of protein  for human nutrition  <cit> . the crop is drought tolerant and as a legume fixes nitrogen, it is able to tolerate low fertility soils  <cit>  and can contribute nitrogen to agricultural systems.

bambara groundnut is cleistogamous, highly inbreeding and has  <dig> pairs of chromosomes   <cit> . the first genetic linkage map of bambara groundnut was reported by basu in  <dig> using a f <dig> segregating population  derived from an interspecific cross between the non-domesticated wild type  and a domesticated form . an initial qtl analysis was carried out on trait differences observed for growth habit, maturity and yield production  <cit> . the developed map consists of  <dig> linkage groups and was 516 cm in length, based on  <dig> amplified fragment length polymorphism  and one cross-species simple sequence repeat  marker, with the inter-marker distance varying from  <dig>  to 32 cm. the first intraspecific genetic map used a f <dig> segregating population  derived from a cross between two domesticated forms of bambara groundnut , sharing the domesticated common parental line with the interspecific cross  <cit> . this intraspecific map was constructed from  <dig> ssr and  <dig> dart array markers covering  <dig>  cm in  <dig> linkage groups. both parental genotypes have significant contrasting features in growth habit and seed eye pattern. tiga nicuru from mali has a bunchy growth habit with longer peduncle length  and does not have eye pattern around the hilum whereas dipc collected from botswana has a semi-spreading morphology with longer petiole and shorter internode length , greater leaf area  and has a dark eye pattern around hilum, in addition to higher pod number , seed weight per plant  and shelling percentage . a dart array-based upgma genetic distance analysis grouped the two parents into different sub-sections based on a previous population structure analysis  <cit> , which has made these two crosses useful in unravelling our understanding of the domestication events in bambara groundnut and the genetic control of a number of morphological and physiological traits. in the future, a completed and annotated genome sequence will become available through the efforts of the african orphan crops consortium  which includes bambara groundnut as one of its targets  <cit> . this will greatly facilitate research in this species, but it will be some time before a fully assembled and annotated genome is available. beyond the  <dig> crops identified for sequencing by aocc, there are believed to be around  <dig>  plant species which have been used by humankind, so the development of translational methodologies for the location of genetic components of traits and their underlying candidate genes is a priority for underutilised crop species. the current research presents one such generic approach, using bambara groundnut as an exemplar species.

here we report the construction of two genetic linkage maps in two intraspecific crosses using genotyping-by-sequencing  dartseq markers , followed by the identification of the most likely syntenic locations for the markers shared between the genomes of common bean , adzuki bean  and mung bean  . these three species have  <dig> pairs of chromosomes and they were chosen not only because they have been sequenced and annotated , but also because of the close evolutionary relationship among these legumes. the divergence time between phaseolus and vigna has been estimated to be  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . the putative synthetic blocks identified across legume genomes would facilitate more effective comparison of gene order in the legume species and assist in the identification of the location of genes underlying qtl involved in controlling agronomic and yield traits in bambara groundnut, facilitating the marker-assisted selection process.

RESULTS
characterisation of dartseq markers
 <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total dartseq markers generated from populations ia and td, respectively, could be mapped to the common bean genome using the marker sequence tag, with 55% of these matches occurring in genomic contexts expected to be transcribed. in line with expectations based on genetic relatedness, a higher percentage of markers showed good sequence homology hits with the vigna genomes, with more than 45% of the bambara groundnut dartseq markers locatable on the adzuki bean and mung bean genomes , nevertheless, some were less informative as they were found to be homologous to the remaining superscaffolds within the genome assemblies which had not been assigned to chromosome locations in the sequenced species.

selection of markers for genetic maps
in our approach, two sets of dartseq markers were used for the construction of the genetic maps; population-specific high quality snp markers and pre-selected common ‘link’ dartseq markers . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> population-specific snp markers were used for the construction of the ia map and the td map, respectively. in addition to these high quality markers chosen using a conventional mapping approach, a set of pre-selected common dartseq markers having the following criteria were added during map construction; 1) polymorphic in the parental lines of both populations, 2) no more than five missing genotypes, 3) sequence mappable to the common bean, adzuki bean and mung bean genomes at high stringency . a total of  <dig> markers passed these selection criteria from an unselected initial pool of  <dig>  snp markers and  <dig>  dominant markers. among these  <dig> pre-selected markers,  <dig>  were snp markers with the remaining  <dig>  being dominant dart markers. of these two sets of high quality selected dartseq markers,  <dig> out of  <dig>  markers showed the expected segregation pattern  in the ia f <dig> segregating population and  <dig> out of  <dig>  markers segregated in the expected pattern in the td f <dig> population  at a significance level of p <  <dig> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of our overall approach in constructing genetic maps of population ia and td having informative common markers from pre-selection




genetic linkage maps from selected markers
the distribution of dominant dart and co-dominant snp markers across each linkage group in both populations is summarised in table  <dig>  using a combination of population-specific and pre-selected markers, two framework genetic maps were constructed from the two crosses; the genetic map of ia: from 263 f <dig> lines of iita <dig> x ankpa <dig> gave  <dig> linkage groups comprising of  <dig> markers and covered  <dig> .2 cm and the genetic map of td: from 71 f <dig> lines of tiga nicuru x dipc gave  <dig> linkage groups consisting of  <dig> markers and covered  <dig> .7 cm . the  <dig> pre-selected common markers in both maps showed consistent positions within the two maps, with minor local marker order differences  probably due to the limited numbers of recombination events separating the different potential marker orders, particularly in the smaller td cross   <cit> . where the orthologous marker order is consistent among the three comparison physical genomes, the chance of having a chromosomal translocation occurring within the same region of bambara groundnut genome is likely to be small, so conserved synteny can be used as a guide to marker order.table  <dig> the distribution of dartseq markers  across each linkage group in both bambara groundnut populations

syntenic relationships with other legume species
the syntenic relationship of the bambara groundnut genetic map derived from two populations to common bean, adzuki bean and mung bean genomes is illustrated in fig. 4a, b and c. from  <dig> linkage groups, four linkage groups  were found to map at the macro level to a single chromosome from each legume species. as an example, lg <dig> shared homology with p. vulgaris chromosome  <dig> , v. radiata chromosome  <dig>  and v. angularis chromosome  <dig> . it is observed that the mung bean genome appears to have the highest similarity with bambara groundnut with the fewest translocations , while there are seven with common bean, although, there is currently lower sequence coverage on the mung bean genome which could affect these conclusions. for example, lg <dig> was found to have better conserved synteny with mung bean as it corresponds to a single chromosome of mung bean and potentially adzuki bean, but two partial chromosomes of common bean. on the other hand, lg <dig> corresponds to pv <dig> and vr <dig> but two partial chromosomes of adzuki bean. a species tree constructed from the de novo transcriptomic assemblies of  <dig> accessions of  <dig> vigna species has suggested that the divergence between bambara groundnut and other studied vigna species is ~ <dig> mya except v. vexillata  <cit> . our observation provides further evidence that bambara groundnut is comparatively more closely related to mung bean than to adzuki bean.fig.  <dig>

as this syntenic mapping approach is achieved through a cross-species comparison, we have been conservative in terms of mapping stringency so that the possibility of having more than one single good match location for a particular bambara groundnut marker sequence tag in the query genome was minimised. however, there is a possibility that the mapping algorithm has misidentifying the best match within the genome of the other species, or that the best match may not have been represented in the comparison species genome sequence. for example, snp <dig> snp |f|0- <dig> marker located at  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> in map ia has a best match position to a genomic region of va <dig>  whilst the adjacent markers in this linkage group mapped to va <dig>  a comparison of the potential sequence matching location suggested that while the va <dig> position gave the higher blast score due to a higher percentage of matching bases , the second best aligned position at va <dig> with a slightly lower match  is the better alignment and agrees with the adjacent pre-selected common markers between 0 cm and  <dig>  cm of this linkage group . therefore, for cases where the genetic location and comparative syntenic position did not match with flanking markers, we manually used blast to determine whether the marker was likely to be a genuine breach of conserved synteny or whether other syntenic target sites might exist. from  <dig> markers which do not show syntenic coherence with their neighbouring markers in either the common bean, adzuki bean or mung bean genome comparison, nine markers could be reassigned through a blast analysis to a syntenic location on the same chromosomes as their flanking markers. a dotted line in lg <dig> indicates that snp <dig> |f|0- <dig> marker has the best match position on pv07;  <dig> ,999 bp with one insertion, one deletion and eight mismatched bases observed but not having any good match to pv <dig> as expected from its flanking markers on the same linkage group. the mapped location on pv <dig> is at a genomic region flanked by at rich sequences  and it could be mapped to the same chromosomes of adzuki bean and mung bean as the other  <dig> pre-selected markers on the same linkage group. together, all these observations suggest that this locus detected a genuine divergence between vigna and phaseolus species.

to illustrate our approach, we have located a significant internode length qtl in the td f <dig> population with a lod score of  <dig>  to lg <dig>  <dig>  cm , explaining  <dig> % of phenotypic variation observed in this cross . the nearest flanking markers from the pre-selected common marker set are snp100025953|f|0- <dig> and snp100027611|f|0- <dig> , which have syntenic blocks at pv <dig> , va <dig>  and vr <dig> . in an attempt to maximise the use of the genomic and genetic resources generated during the mung bean sequencing effort, kang et al. identified the syntenic blocks of soybean qtl compared to the mung bean genome  <cit> . this has further allowed us to observe that soybean internode length 1– <dig> qtl falls within this bambara groundnut qtl conserved synteny region. this region is  <dig>  mbp in length spanning  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp of vr <dig> . the soybean internode length qtl was identified from a ril population of essex x forrest , with a lod score of  <dig>  explaining  <dig> % of phenotypic variation  <cit> . by referring to the well-annotated common bean genome, there are a total of  <dig> genes underlying this corresponding regions , which could help in narrowing down the potential candidate genes for further investigation. to increase the marker resolution in this region, more population-specific markers could also be mapped to the common bean genome  which would provide further information to refine the search area for candidate genes .table  <dig> the qtl analysis of internode length from td f <dig> population




collectively, the finding of a predicted soybean internode length qtl  is in accordance with our bambara groundnut internode length qtl study and has demonstrated that our approach could be adopted in other minor and underutilised species, both to translate existing information in more studied species and to identify de novo candidate lists. the current coincidence of the qtl in soybean and bambara groundnut for internode length needs further investigation and the gene content within the target region between species of interest is by no means guaranteed to be the same, although the closer the species are related taxonomically, the more likely it is that they will have similar gene content in the regions of conserved synteny.

CONCLUSIONS
the ability to use pre-selected gbs markers in two bambara groundnut crosses to generate consistent and coherent linkage maps which have conserved synteny links to the sequenced chromosomes of common bean , adzuki bean  and mung bean  suggests that this approach could be applied to other species of interest which have limited ex 
ante sequence information, but have closely related sequenced genome relatives. our preliminary results overlaying the location of within-species qtl onto sequenced genomes suggests that translation of information  can be used in an attempt to identify candidate controlling genes for further analysis within the species of interest which has no genome sequence. in bambara groundnut, before the release of whole genome sequence by aocc, the identified potential candidate genes involved in internode length regulation could be further investigated for a better understanding of the domestication events in this species and a key trait for growth habit in different environments.
