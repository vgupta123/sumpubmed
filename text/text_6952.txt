BACKGROUND
specific identification of cell types in bovine tissues is hindered by the limited availability of anti-bovine antibodies. the species cross-reactivity information of other commercially available antibodies is also often limited. thus, suitable antibodies must be searched for by trial and error. this is further complicated by the fact that for many antibodies a successful immunostaining is only accomplished after an optimized antigen retrieval treatment.

as a by-product of a research project on stem cell fates <cit> , we have evaluated a selection of antibodies for identifying major bovine cell types in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. some of these have been raised against bovine antigens, some are previously known to be bovine cross-reactive, and others we have tested without such prior knowledge. optimal antigen retrieval methods for each antibody are reported. in addition to antibodies, two lectins are presented. the emphasis is on paraformaldehyde-fixed tissues, but as some antibodies are incompatible with such material, we have also used ethanol fixation.

RESULTS
the marker panel is summarized in table i, with results from various antigen retrieval treatments tested. succesfully stained tissue sections are presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the results are further commented below, including notes on any nonspecific staining detected.

epithelium
several anti-keratin antibodies were evaluated for epithelial markers. the ae1/ae <dig> monoclonal antibody cocktail <cit> , raised against human epidermal keratin, was the most useful pan-epithelial marker. with alkaline antigen retrieval , most types of epithelia were strongly and specifically stained with this antibody. neutral or protease-induced retrieval was sufficient for some but not all tissues.

another pan-keratin antibody lu- <dig> <cit>  also stained most epithelia with protease-induced retrieval, but did not cover all epithelia as comprehensively as ae1/ae <dig> in our hands.

the polyclonal pan-keratin antibody tested yielded nonspecific staining of cells. the high molecular weight cytokeratin antibody 34β e <dig> <cit>  provided very strong staining of some epithelia , but is obviously not as comprehensive as the pan-keratin markers.

few bovine endothelial markers are available. the anti- von willebrand antibody <cit>  tested stains many but not all endothelia. notably, new blood vessels in granulation tissue were strongly stained. the lectins ml-i <cit>  and especially gsl i-b <dig> <cit>  yielded strong staining of endothelial cells, but they also stain some leukocyte populations. we failed to obtain a good staining with the anti- type iv collagen antibody m3f <dig> <cit>  or with the polyclonal anti- endothelial nitric oxide synthase antibody <cit> .

connective tissue
vimentin is a general marker for cells of the mesenchymal lineage. the monoclonal anti- porcine vimentin antibody v <dig> <cit>  provided strong and specific staining even without antigen retrieval.

the type i procollagen antibody sp <dig> d <dig>  <cit>  stained active fibroblasts in various connective tissues. the best staining was obtained with the alkaline retrieval method. some nonspecific staining was seen, in sebaceous glands for example.

muscle
the desmin antibody d <dig> stained all muscle types, performing best after neutral antigen retrieval  <cit> . the muscle actin antibody hhf <dig>  <cit>  recognizes the alpha and gamma isotypes present in all muscle types. the acid and alkaline retrieval methods yielded optimal results. the α-smooth muscle actin antibody 1a <dig>  <cit>  stains only a subset of smooth muscle tissues, due to the more restricted expression pattern of the antigen. the circular muscle layer in the intestine was not stained. the neutral antigen retrieval method produced the best results with this antibody. all these antibodies were specific for muscle tissues.

nervous tissue
the monoclonal anti- neun antibody a <dig>  <cit>  was the most comprehensive neuronal marker tested. it stained most neurons, purkinje cells being a notable exception. best results were obtained with alkaline retrieval.

tubulin and neurofilament antibodies are also useful as general neuronal markers. majority of neurons were stained by both tubulin βiii antibodies  <cit>  and the pan-neurofilament cocktail <cit> , and more restricted subgroups by the neurofilament 160/ <dig> kd antibody <cit> , as expected.

astroglia were beautifully stained with the polyclonal anti-gfap antibody, with most pretreatments. oligodendroglia were successfully stained with the anti-cnpase antibody 11-5b, whereas the anti-o <dig> antibody  <dig> <cit>  failed to produce any specific staining in our hands. s <dig> <cit>  is a more general marker for glial cells. it is also expressed in several cell types outside the nervous system.

the microglial cells were very weakly stained with the pan-leukocyte and macrophage markers tested. the mistletoe lectin ml-i <cit>  yielded successful staining with all pre-treatments. it also stains most endothelial cells.

leukocytes
leukocyte markers are often species-specific, and most commonly used in flow cytometry. thus, most of the antibodies tested were raised against bovine antigens, but information on histological applications was limited.

of the pan-leukocyte markers, the anti- cd <dig> antibody cactb51a <cit>  worked well on ethanol-fixed material with mild protease treatment, except for the microglia, which were weakly stained. the quality of the cc <dig> antibody <cit>  appeared to suffer from a change in the production method during the research project.

we tested two cd11a/ <dig> antibodies, of which bat75a <cit>  was useful with acid antigen retrieval, while muc76a <cit>  failed with any pre-treatment.

for lymphocytes, the cd3ε  and cd79α  antibodies  <cit>  raised against synthetic cytoplasmic peptides worked well with antigen retrieval, providing a strong and specific staining. the anti- immunoglobulin antibodies successfully stained b cells with alkaline retrieval <cit> .

myeloid cells were stained with the anti- cd11b antibody mm10a <cit>  using acid retrieval or ethanol-fixed material. the macrophage marker cd <dig> <cit>  was also useful with protease-treated sections, but did not stain microglia. the cd <dig> antibody mm61a <cit>  was only useful with ethanol-fixed material. the polyclonal anti-lysozyme antibody <cit>  stained a number of cells in the intestinal epithelium, for example, but we failed to confirm the specificity of the staining.

cell status
the proliferation marker mib- <dig> <cit>  yielded good staining with alkaline antigen retrieval. apoptotic cells were successfully stained with the cleaved caspase  <dig> antibody <cit>  using neutral retrieval, although the staining was not very strong.

CONCLUSIONS
in order to facilitate identification of major cell types in paraffin sections of bovine tissues, we evaluated a number of markers for immunohistochemistry and lectin histochemistry. antibodies raised against bovine antigens or known to be bovine cross-reactive were used where possible. if no information on bovine reactivity was available, antibodies with broadest species cross-reactivity were selected. two lectins were used in addition to the antibody markers.

the panel of  <dig> useful markers allows the identification of all major cell types in cattle tissue sections. with paraformaldehyde-fixed material, heat-induced antigen retrieval is beneficial for most antibodies. by selecting a suitable retrieval protocol, most markers can be successfully applied to this type of material.
