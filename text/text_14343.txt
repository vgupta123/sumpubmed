BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens is a γ –proteobacterium that is found throughout terrestrial ecosystems but is most commonly isolated from the surface of plant roots and leaves. strains of p. fluorescens are physiologically and ecologically diverse, representing at least five biovars  <cit> . the extreme heterogeneity among p. fluorescens isolates has led scientists to propose that strains of p. fluorescens form a complex of species  <cit> . recent analyses that compare the genomes of several p. fluorescens strains support that hypothesis  <cit>  and demonstrate that strains of p. fluorescens arose from at least three separate lineages  <cit> .

the large genomes of p. fluorescens provide an extensive biochemical repertoire that enables some strains to produce and secrete bioactive molecules that mediate microbe-microbe, plant-microbe, and insect-microbe interactions  <cit> . these secondary metabolites include antimicrobial compounds like phenazines, polyketides, cyclic lipopeptides, pyrrolnitrin, hydrogen cyanide, and others  <cit> . because these compounds may play a critical role in both microbial and plant ecology, there is continuing interest in characterizing secondary metabolites produced by isolates of p. fluorescens.

p. fluorescens wh <dig>  a strain originally isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat  <cit> , has been shown in our laboratories to produce and secrete a low molecular weight compound that has selective herbicidal and antimicrobial properties  <cit> . this compound, which we termed a germination-arrest factor , selectively and irreversibly arrests the germination of a large number of graminaceous species, including a number of invasive grassy weeds  <cit> . we identified gaf as the non-proteinogenic amino acid 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine   <cit> . fvg was subsequently shown to also have selective antimicrobial activity against a few strains of bacteria , including erwinia amylovora, the bacterial plant pathogen that is the causal agent of the disease of orchard crops known as fireblight.

the genome of p. fluorescens wh <dig> has been sequenced  <cit>  and compared to other sequenced strains of p. fluorescens <cit> . among sequenced strains of pseudomonads, these comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that wh <dig> was most closely related to sbw <dig>  these two strains appear to represent a distinct clade within the lineage that includes p. fluorescens a <dig> and bg33r  <cit> . these analyses have shown that 69% of p. fluorescens wh <dig> genes have an orthologous sequence in sbw <dig>  and they share extensive long-range synteny  <cit> . nonetheless, in spite of the overall similarity of the sbw <dig> genome to that of wh <dig>  sbw <dig> lacks a gene cluster we have shown to be essential to the biosynthesis of fvg  <cit> .

p. fluorescens sbw <dig> was first isolated from the leaf surface of a sugar beet plant  <cit> . since then it has been used as a model organism for evolutionary and plant colonization studies  <cit> . sbw <dig> has also been extensively studied for its plant growth-promoting properties and its ability to protect peas from seedling damping-off caused by the oomycete pythium ultimatum <cit> . the secondary metabolites known to be produced by sbw <dig> include pyoverdine siderophores  <cit>  and a viscosin-like cyclic lipopeptide  <cit> . the latter compound exhibits zoosporicidal activity towards a different oomycete, phytophthora infestans, but its primary role appears to be in biofilm formation and facilitating the surface motility of sbw <dig>  <cit> .

although the p. fluorescens sbw <dig> genome does not contain the gene cluster we have found to be essential for fvg production, the overall similarity of the wh <dig> and sbw <dig> genomes attracted our interest in the latter strain and in the possibility that sbw <dig> might also produce some type of non-proteinogenic amino acid. in the present study, we report that p. fluorescens sbw <dig> produces and secretes a ninhydrin-reactive compound that selectively inhibits the growth of several bacterial plant pathogens. this compound was purified from p. fluorescens sbw <dig> culture filtrates and identified as the amino acid l-furanomycin. to our knowledge, this is only the second report of furanomycin production by a microbe and the first report of furanomycin production by a pseudomonad.

RESULTS
presence of ninhydrin-reactive compounds in p. fluorescens sbw <dig> culture filtrate
as a preliminary test for the production of non-proteinogenic amino acids by p. fluorescens sbw <dig>  and to compare sbw <dig> culture filtrates with filtrate from wh <dig>  dried culture filtrates of sbw <dig> and wh <dig> were extracted with 90% ethanol. aliquots of the concentrated extracts were fractionated by thin-layer chromatography  on cellulose and silica plates. the resulting chromatograms were then stained with ninhydrin . the extract of sbw <dig> culture filtrate yielded a single, strongly-staining, ninhydrin-reactive band on both cellulose and silica tlc plates. on cellulose tlc plates, this band exhibited greater mobility than the fvg band visible in the chromatogram of the extract from wh <dig>  on silica tlc plates, the sbw <dig> band had a slightly lower rf than fvg from wh <dig> 

biological activity of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> culture filtrate
the antimicrobial properties of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> culture filtrate were tested against a panel of bacteria that included multiple races, pathovars, and strains of eleven bacterial species . of the nineteen bacterial strains tested in our standard agar diffusion assay, six were sensitive to the filtrate as evidenced by a large zone of clearing about the central well containing the sbw <dig> culture filtrate. these six strains are listed in table  <dig> and included five plant pathogens. typical results of the agar diffusion assay are illustrated in additional file  <dig>  which shows results with five of the sensitive strains and one of the insensitive strains tested. of the strains inhibited by sbw <dig> culture filtrate, p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> was the most sensitive. however, because p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> harbors its own antibacterial properties  <cit> , we chose dickeya dadantii  <dig>  a pathovar that causes bacterial soft rot of corn, to use in following antibiotic activity in subsequent purification work. the bacterial plant pathogens inhibited by sbw <dig> culture filtrate included erwinia amylovora, which is also selectively inhibited by culture filtrate from p. fluorescens wh <dig>  <cit> . however, unlike wh <dig>  sbw <dig> culture filtrate did not inhibit the germination of poa annua in our standard germination arrest assay  <cit> .

association of the antimicrobial activity of sbw <dig> culture filtrate with a ninhydrin-reactive compound
the possibility that the antimicrobial activity of sbw <dig> culture filtrates was associated with the ninhydrin-reactive component of the filtrate was examined in additional fractionation studies. preliminary experiments determined that most of the ninhydrin-reactive compound from sbw <dig> culture filtrate was extracted from the dried culture filtrate solids by extraction with 85% ethanol. to determine if the antimicrobial activity of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> culture filtrate could be attributed to the ninhyrin-reactive component of the filtrate, aliquots of the 85% ethanol extract were fractionated on replicate cellulose tlc plates. one of the chromatograms was stained with ninhydrin, and the remaining cellulose plate was divided into twelve 1-cm zones that were then extracted with water. the resulting extracts were tested for antimicrobial activity in our standard assay. all of the antimicrobial activity towards d. dadantii  <dig> was coincident with the position of the ninhydrin-band on the replicate plate . similar results were obtained with p. syringae pv. maculicola m <dig> 

purification of the ninhydrin-reactive component of sbw <dig> culture filtrate
purification of the ninhydrin-reactive compound from p. fluorescens sbw <dig> culture filtrate was undertaken by a modification of the strategy used by mcphail et al. <cit>  to purify fvg. sbw <dig> culture filtrate  was taken to dryness in vacuo, and the dried solids were extracted with 85% ethanol. following evaporation of the 85% ethanol extract, the solids were dissolved in a small volume of water and applied to a sephadex g- <dig> column equilibrated with deionized water for fractionation by ion exclusion chromatography. the elution profile of this column  was monitored by assaying aliquots of each column fraction with chromeazurol reagents according to the protocol previously developed by mcphail et al. <cit> . the profile exhibited a distinct peak of cu-binding activity  followed by a smaller peak, both of which overlapped an extended peak of fe-binding activity . the fractions corresponding to the larger peak of cu-binding activity were pooled, taken to dryness in vacuo, and the recovered solids dissolved in 76% ethanol for preparative tlc fractionation. following preparative tlc, the area on the tlc plate corresponding to the position of the ninhydrin-reactive compound was scraped from each plate and extracted with deionized water. the combined aqueous extracts were dried in vacuo and dissolved in a small volume of deionized water for rechromatography on a sephadex g- <dig> column.

the elution profile for sephadex g- <dig> column fractionation of the material recovered from preparative tlc purification exhibited a cu-binding peak that was clearly separated from a smaller fe-binding peak, indicating that the ninhydrin-reactive compound was separated from the contaminating phosphate . the fractions from the cu-binding peak were pooled as indicated, and an aliquot of this pooled material was tested for antimicrobial activity in agar diffusion assays. the tested aliquot strongly inhibited the growth of d. dadantii  <dig>  the pooled fraction was then taken to dryness and re-dissolved in 76% ethanol. tlc analysis of an aliquot of the 76% solution gave a single ninhydrin-staining band at the expected rf, and no uv-absorbing or fluorescent compounds were detected. the remainder of the 76% ethanol solution of the purified compound, corresponding to ca.  <dig> ml of original culture filtrate, was concentrated in vacuo and yielded  <dig>  mg of a white amorphous solid, of which  <dig>  mg was dissolved in  <dig> μl of deuterated water  for nuclear magnetic resonance  analysis. the remaining  <dig>  mg was submitted for high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry  to determine molecular composition.

identification of the purified ninhydrin-reactive compound
hresims data for the purified compound provided a molecular ion + at m/z  <dig> . examining the microbial natural products database antibase  <dig>  the natural compound identifier  reported  <dig> nitrogen-containing compounds from a search of the mass range  <dig>  to  <dig>  da. six of these were alpha amino acids. inspection of the 1h nmr spectrum  for the purified compound revealed an upfield methyl doublet , and five deshielded multiplets consistent with five heteroatom-substituted or olefinic methines . these six signals were correlated in a single spin system as judged from the cosy spectrum. two additional complex multiplets appearing mid-field in the 1h nmr spectrum did not integrate to relative integer values, and showed no cosy correlations to the established spin system. in combination with two additional mid-field 13c resonances in the 13c nmr spectrum  these 1h signals could be attributed to contaminating glycerol and discounted from further consideration. the 13c nmr spectrum also showed a quaternary 13c signal , as well as heteronuclear single quantum coherence-correlated resonances for five methines and one methyl carbon in the purified compound. the methine 13c chemical shifts represented two olefinic carbons , two oxygenated carbons , and an amine-substituted carbon . in combination with the hreims data, these nmr data support a molecular formula of c7h11no <dig> and the molecular structure of the alpha amino acid furanomycin   <cit> . as anticipated, the nmr data for the purified compound matched closely with those reported for l-furanomycin  <cit>  and differed significantly from those for four reported synthetic diastereomers  <cit> . therefore, the 2s, 2′r, 5′s configuration of l-furanomycin could be assigned, although the presence of the small amount of contaminating glycerol prevented an accurate optical rotation value from being assigned. the molecular structure of l-furanomycin is shown in figure  <dig> 

reversal of the antimicrobial activity of sbw <dig> culture filtrate with selected amino acids
the ability of furanomycin to inhibit the growth of various bacteria was reported to be reversed by the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, or valine  <cit> . to determine if the mode of action of furanomycin in inhibiting plant pathogenic bacteria is similar to the mode of action previously described, we added these individual amino acids to sbw <dig> culture filtrates  and assayed their ability to inhibit the growth of d. dadantii  <dig>  glutamine, alanine, and serine, which we had found previously to reverse the effects of fvg in inhibiting the growth of erwinia amylovora, were also tested in this manner. d. dadantii  <dig> was not sensitive to sbw <dig> culture filtrate containing isoleucine, leucine, or valine . however, d. dadantii remained sensitive to sbw <dig> culture filtrate supplemented with glutamine or alanine and to the unmodified filtrate control . these results indicate that the capacity of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> culture filtrate to inhibit the growth of d. dadantii  <dig> was reversed in the presence of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, but not glutamine or alanine. the ability of serine to block antimicrobial activity in these tests was less clear. when serine was added to the culture filtrate, smaller zones of reduced lawn density were observed. however, because these zones were difficult to measure, the data were not included in our statistical analyses.

discussion
the identification of furanomycin in p. fluorescens sbw <dig> culture filtrate is the first report of this compound occurring as a natural product of a pseudomonad. previously, streptomyces threomyceticus atcc  <dig> was the only microbe known to produce this antibiotic  <cit> . the biosynthesis of furanomycin in s. threomyceticus was investigated by parry and co-workers  <cit> , who obtained evidence from feeding studies that the synthesis proceeded via a polyketide pathway that originated from propionate and acetate. subsequent chemical mutagenic studies suggested that the pathway involved at least six intermediate steps after assembly of the polyketide chain  <cit> . however, the specific genes affected by these mutations were not identified. the pathway in sbw <dig> has yet to be investigated.

the identification of furanomycin as a secondary metabolite of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> adds to a small list of non-proteinogenic amino acids that are known to be produced and secreted by pseudomonads. in addition to furanomycin, this list includes fvg, produced by wh <dig>  <cit> , rhizobitoxine  vinylglycine), produced by p. andropogonis <cit> , methoxyvinylglycine , produced by p. aeruginosa   <cit> , and 3-methylarginine, produced by p. syringae pv. syringae <cit> . we have observed that a number of other strains of pseudomonads produce and secrete ninhydrin-reactive compounds that may represent non-proteinogenic amino acids, but these compounds have yet to be identified.

the non-proteinogenic amino acids identified as secondary metabolites of pseudomonads all display some type of selective antimicrobial properties in in vitro tests. for example, fvg and mvg selectively inhibit the growth of erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fireblight, an important disease of roseaceous orchard crops  <cit> . mvg also inhibits growth of acanthamoeba castellanii <cit>  and bacillus sp. 1283b  <cit> . likewise, 3-methylarginine suppresses the growth of p. syringae pv. glycinia, the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight  <cit> . furanomycin has been shown previously to strongly inhibit t-even coliphage, as well as the growth of several microorganisms   <cit> . our study expands the known range of bacteria that are susceptible to furanomycin to include several plant pathogens, including d. dadantii, p. syringae, and e. amylovora, as well as the nonpathogenic strain bacillus megaterium. the specificity of these effects is of particular interest in relation to the potential utility of these organisms for the biocontrol of plant pathogens.

the production of furanomycin by sbw <dig> appears to account for the selective antibacterial activities of the culture filtrates from this organism grown under our culture conditions. the reversal of these effects in the presence of isoleucine is consistent with previous reports that this antibiotic functions as an isoleucine analog  <cit>  and is recognized by the isoleucyl-trna synthetase from escherichia coli, where it is charged to isoleucine-trna and interferes with protein synthesis in that organism  <cit> . it is less obvious why valine and leucine also interfere with the antibiotic activity of furanomycin, but it is possible that furanomycin interferes with the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids, and the presence of an exogenous source of isoleucine, leucine, or valine reverses or compensates for this interference. whether the numerous pseudomonads and bacterial strains that are insensitive to furanomycin possess isoleucyl-trna synthetase activities of more stringent specificity or resist the effects of this antibiotic by other mechanisms remains to be determined.

in addition to their antimicrobial effects, some of the amino acid analogs produced by pseudomonads elicit a response in higher plants. as noted previously, fvg, produced by p. fluorescens wh <dig>  inhibits germination of a large number of graminaceous species  <cit> . rhizobitoxine can either act as a phytotoxin , or it can facilitate nodulation in host legumes   <cit> . it is not yet known if furanomycin mediates any of the plant growth promoting properties of sbw <dig> or if it is involved in any other type of plant-microbe interaction.

the biological role that non-proteinogenic amino acids play in pseudomonad physiology and ecology in natural environments has yet to be defined. phenazine antibiotics have been reported to contribute to the ecological competence of pseudomonads in soil habitats  <cit> , but it is uncertain whether the antimicrobial activities of furanomycin and other amino acid analogs, or the observed effects of some of these compounds on plant growth, are important in natural settings. this class of pseudomonad secondary metabolites has received limited attention to date, and further investigations will be needed to determine their function and importance.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study demonstrate that the secondary metabolites produced by p. fluorescens sbw <dig> includes the non-proteinogenic amino acid known as l-furanomycin. this compound is shown here to inhibit the growth of several bacterial strains, including a number of plant-pathogenic microbes. previously, furanomycin was only known to be produced by a single strain of s. threomyceticus. the antimicrobial activity of furanomycin observed here was reversed in the presence of exogenous leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which is consistent with the previously reported ability of this compound to act as an isoleucine antagonist. this study adds furanomycin to the small group of non-proteinogenic amino acids that are known to be produced by pseudomonads, suggesting that these compounds may have a more ubiquitous presence and a more universal role in pseudomonad ecology than has been previously recognized.
