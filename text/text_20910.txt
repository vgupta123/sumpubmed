BACKGROUND
genetic linkage maps are highly valuable tools for comparative genome analyses and the identification of genomic regions carrying major genes and quantitative trait loci  controlling agronomical traits. they are a prerequisite for further map-based cloning or marker-assisted breeding programs. in recent years, the establishment of genetic maps have benefited from the development of new types of molecular markers which take advantage of automated sequencing and genotyping technologies. while the first marker-based genetic maps were built with restriction fragment length polymorphisms , random amplified polymorphic dnas  and amplified fragment length polymorphisms , dense genetic maps now include simple sequence repeats  and more recently single nucleotide polymorphisms . dense genetic maps based on sequence-derived markers allow finer comparative genome analyses to be performed based on comparisons with sequenced related genomes and to accelerate the process of map-based cloning of major genes and qtl. they are also very useful tools to assist sequence assembly in whole de novo genome sequencing projects  <cit> . moreover, by integrating genetic map data with genotyping data generated from collections of accessions/varieties linkage disequilibrium  pattern along the genome of a given species can be investigated, which is a prerequisite for precise genome wide association studies . gwas performed with a large number of snps have been reported in a number of crop species such as maize  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , barley  <cit> , and rice  <cit>  the success of gwas to locate genes responsible for complex traits depends on the extent of ld, the number, the distribution and the diversity of markers and the underlying structure in the studied collections. since the diversity of markers and the extent of ld may vary depending on the history of the collections  <cit> , they should be investigated prior to gwas design.

oilseed rape  is a prominent oilseed crop in most world continents including america, europe, australia and asia and is cultivated for food  and feed  as well as for non-food uses such as biofuels or lubricants. it is the second world oil crop after soybean  with a world production of more than  <dig> million tonnes per year. b. napus is an amphidiploid species  that arose from hybridization between b. rapa  and b. oleracea  diploid species  <cit>  within the past  <dig>  years  <cit> . b. napus includes spring and winter oilseed rape, rutabaga or swede, and some fodder crops. it likely originated from a few interspecific hybridization events  <cit>  and has only a short domestication history of about 400–500 years  <cit> . for these reasons, the genetic diversity within b. napus germplasm is rather low compared to that of its two progenitor species b. rapa and b. oleracea. moreover, two bottlenecks have occurred during breeding of modern oilseed rape varieties through the selection for low erucic acid content in the oil and low glucosinolate content in the seeds, which reduced the genetic diversity in modern varieties  <cit> .

over the last 20 years, many genetic b. napus maps have been built, which have been progressively integrating various types of markers  <cit> . these maps have been used for genetic studies of various agronomical traits including development traits  <cit> , seed quality  <cit> , yield components  <cit>  and disease resistance  <cit>  as well as for genetic study of chromosome pairing  <cit> . the establishment of genetic maps of diploid and amphidiploid brassica species, and their comparison and alignment to arabidopsis genome sequence provided insights into brassica genome organization and evolution after the different rounds of polyploidization and diploidization occurring in these species history. extensive collinearity observed between a. thaliana and b. napus led to the description of a genomic block system determined by parkin et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that the structure of the brassica a and c genomes could be described with approximately  <dig> conserved blocks. a framework built of  <dig> genomic blocks  within the ancestral karyotype was then proposed that represents an extension of the above mentioned study  <cit> . this conserved block structure was then further investigated in related species such as b. juncea <cit>  or b. oleracea <cit>  and led to a block arrangement comparison in the a, b and c genomes  <cit> . it was also recently confirmed in b. napus using dense genetic maps with ssr  <cit> , and snp  <cit>  markers.

the availability of high numbers of markers now makes it possible to investigate more precisely genome wide diversity and the extent of ld in oilseed rape . to date, the published studies relied on either a low number of lines or low number of markers. ecke et al.  <cit>  used  <dig> aflp markers to examine the extent of ld in a set of  <dig> winter oilseed rape lines. bus et al.  <cit>  investigated patterns of genetic diversity and the extent of ld in  <dig> inbred lines corresponding to different germplasms of oilseed rape with  <dig> ssr markers. xiao et al.  <cit>  assessed the genetic diversity and the extent of ld in a panel of  <dig> inbred lines from all over the world but with a great proportion originating from china using  <dig> ssr markers. harper et al.  <cit>  carried out associative transcriptomics on  <dig> b. napus lines using >60 k snps and confirmed the low overall level of ld in b. napus.

in this context, our objectives were to  obtain a dense integrated snp genetic map of b. napus built from four segregating populations  investigate the polymorphism of these snps within and among different germplasm types of a large b. napus collection and  assess the extent and pattern of ld between densely mapped snp markers.

RESULTS
map description
a total of  <dig> snps was selected for infinium genotyping according to the criteria described in methods section. of these,  <dig> were retained to build the four individual maps as they exhibited clear segregation patterns after genome studio analysis. the numbers of snp markers mapped were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the dydh , tndh , aadh  and amdh  populations, respectively . in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> pcr markers  were mapped in the dydh and tndh populations. individual maps covered 1947 cm for the tndh and amdh populations, 2049 cm for the dydh and 3495 cm for the aadh ones and the numbers of markers per cm were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the percentage of mapped snps that showed segregation distortion was estimated at  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the dydh, tndh, aadh and amdh populations, respectively. most of the linkage groups in the dydh and tndh maps showed segregation distortion except a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> on dydh and a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> on the tndh maps . on the amdh map, only a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> showed segregation distortion. many regions were distorted in more than one map such as regions on a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> 

the integrated map comprised  <dig> markers  and covered 2250 cm, which corresponds to a density of  <dig>  markers  per cm . twice as many snp markers were assigned a position on the a genome compared to the c genome:  <dig>  and  <dig>  were mapped on the a and c genomes, respectively, which correspond to  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps per cm. this difference between genomes a and c was less pronounced for the amdh population. of these  <dig> snp markers,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were mapped in only one or were common to two, three or four populations, respectively. the amdh population had the smallest number of markers  in common with the other populations whereas  <dig> to 40% of the markers were common between the aadh, dydh and tndh populations. these percentages were similar if we consider the snps that were mapped to the a and c genomes, respectively.

the recombination rate on the aadh map was higher than on the others  as expected due to the mating scheme used to produce the population. this increase was relatively homogeneous across all the linkage groups, except for the bottom of a <dig> and the top of c <dig>  an increase in recombination rate was also observed at the top of a <dig> on the tndh map. overall, very good collinearity was observed between all the maps with the exception of three inversions that were observed at the bottom of a <dig> on the tndh map, at the top of c <dig> on the aadh map and at the bottom of c <dig> on the amdh map. the amdh population was the least polymorphic with the lowest number of markers and an overall lower marker density: many regions were not polymorphic at all or had a very scarce number of markers. non-polymorphic regions were observed on almost all the linkage groups and in particular very low coverage was obtained for linkage groups a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> 

we anchored the genetic maps onto the arabidopsis genome using homology searches with the snp context sequences and the previous anchorage method described in wang et al.  <cit>  for ssr and other pcr markers. out of the  <dig> mapped markers,  <dig> gave hits with arabidopsis genes. from these hits,  <dig> collinearity blocks were identified and represented in relation to the  <dig> blocks defined by schranz et al.  <cit>  . since the collinearity between the different individual maps was very good, the conservation of the block organization between these individual maps was also very good with some additional blocks on some maps due to the different number of markers mapped in these regions . however, few polymorphic markers were identified in some blocks especially on the amdh map, which, as mentioned above, showed the lowest polymorphism rate. indeed, on this map some blocks were totally or partially monomorphic . the a block was also partially monomorphic or missing on a <dig> of the dydh map as well as the r block on a <dig> and c <dig> of the tndh map.

in addition to these  <dig> markers included in the integrated map,  <dig> markers were assigned to different linkage groups across the individual maps . further investigation of these cases showed that these markers were included in the same synteny blocks and mapped to duplicated regions present on different linkage groups. thus they appear to be homoeologous or duplicated loci.

validation of a  <dig> snp public set in a goldengate assay
a set of  <dig> snps was selected for even distribution over the integrated linkage map and a good level of polymorphism in the osr collection. the characteristics of these  <dig> snps including their anchorage onto arabidopsis and b. rapa sequences are described in additional file 6: table s <dig>  of these  <dig> snps,  <dig>  were successfully genotyped on the illumina beadxpress platform. twenty-nine could not be localized on the integrated map as they were assigned to different linkage groups on the individual maps. the distribution of the remaining  <dig> snps, that were located on the integrated linkage map , showed that the mean distances between two snp markers were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm for the original set and the goldengate validated set, respectively, which on average corresponded to a 35% increase. consequently, the number of gaps over 10 cm increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  out of  <dig> and  <dig> intervals, respectively in these two sets. out of the  <dig> snps,  <dig> and  <dig> showed a significant hit with arabidopsis genes or b. rapa sequences, respectively. a total of  <dig> snps had a significant hit on the b. rapa pseudo-chromosomes:  <dig> and  <dig> were located on the a and c linkage groups, respectively. ninety-five percent of the snps located on a linkage groups showed a hit on the corresponding pseudo-chromosomes. eighty-six percent of the snps located on the c linkage groups showed a hit on the expected pseudo-chromosomes according to the known collinearity between the a and c genomes.

polymorphism in the b. napus collection
a total of  <dig> snps were validated and scored on the b. napus collection. on average, only  <dig> % of the data  was missing and  <dig> %  was heterozygous  per variety. only  <dig> varieties showed more than 10% of heterozygosity. a total of  <dig> snps with a minor allele frequency  greater than 5% on the whole collection was retained for further polymorphism study and analysis of molecular variance . an amova was carried out to assess genetic differentiation between fodder, spring oilseed rape and winter oilseed rape varieties, and between the three seed quality subgroups  within the spring and winter oilseed rape types. the level of within subgroup variation was  <dig>  and  <dig> % whether we considered fodder varieties or not, with fst indices of  <dig>  and  <dig>  and differentiation indices between types of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the fst indices were  <dig>  and  <dig>  within winter and spring oilseed rape types, respectively.

of the  <dig> snps above,  <dig> were localised on the integrated map and were further used for principal component analyses . three pcas were performed using either i) the whole set of mapped snps; ii) the  <dig> snps that were mapped on the a genome or iii) the  <dig> snps that were mapped on the c genome. the first two axes accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the variation, respectively in these three pcas . out of the  <dig> snps selected subset,  <dig> snps were located on the integrated map. in the pca performed with these  <dig> snps or with the  <dig> and  <dig> snps mapped on the a and c genomes, respectively, the first two axes accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the variation. in each case, the first axis differentiated the spring oilseed rape from the winter oilseed rape accessions and the fodder rape varieties were between the two groups. the second axis mainly discriminated european and canadian  spring oilseed rape from asian spring “++” oilseed rape. no clear differentiation between “++”, “+0” and “00” winter oilseed rape subgroups was observed.

the  <dig> snps that were localised on the integrated map were further used for investigating polymorphism variation across the linkage groups. table  <dig> and additional file 7: figure s <dig> show the mean polymorphism information content  values for each linkage groups in the whole collection, the fodder, spring and winter oilseed rape types, as well as in the “++”, “0+” and “00” winter oilseed rape subgroups. the polymorphism level was significantly higher in spring oilseed rape than in fodder and winter oilseed rape and was significantly lower in winter oilseed rape than in fodder rape. the exception was the c <dig> linkage group where the polymorphism was much lower in the spring oilseed rape types. on average, the polymorphism level was slightly lower for the a than for the c linkage groups except for the spring oilseed rape types and there was a great variability between linkage groups. a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> were the least polymorphic linkage groups for the a genome, especially in winter oilseed rape. for the c genome, c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  c <dig> were the least polymorphic in winter oilseed rape and fodder types, respectively. for winter oilseed rape, the polymorphism level was quite similar between the “++”, “0+” and “00” subgroups for the a linkage groups whereas there was a greater variability for the c linkage groups with some linkage groups such as c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> showing lower pic values in the “0+” and “00” subgroups and other linkage groups such as c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> showing higher pic values in the “00” subgroup. the mean pic values were also estimated for the whole collection with the mapped snps from the  <dig> snp subset. these were significantly higher than the ones estimated with the full snp set , due to the criteria used for their selection.

mean pic values estimated on the a, c and whole genomes are given for each subgroup of the collection and on the whole collection with the full set of snps or the  <dig> snp subset. the number of accessions in each subgroup is indicated in parentheses.

additional file 7: figure s <dig> shows that the pic values varied differently along the different linkage groups. when we compared fodder rape, spring oilseed rape  and winter oilseed rape , there were large regions on most a linkage groups except a <dig> where the level of polymorphism was higher in the spring oilseed rape types. the polymorphism level in winter oilseed rape was either lower or similar to the one observed in fodder rape, depending on the a regions. on the c linkage groups, the level of polymorphism was lower in some regions in winter oilseed rape e.g. on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> linkage groups but elsewhere the variation in pic values between the different types was more erratic. the c <dig> and to a lesser extent the c <dig> linkage groups showed a contrasted situation with a lower polymorphism in spring oilseed rape along most of their length. when we compared the three winter oilseed rape subgroups , variation in pic values along the different linkage groups was very contrasted since it decreased or increased in the “0+” and/or “00” subgroups depending on regions. nevertheless, regions showing a decrease in polymorphism were more numerous.

ld mapping
the  <dig> snps that were localised on the integrated map and had a maf above 5% were then used for mean ld estimation and ld pattern study along the different linkage groups depending on the oilseed rape types. the whole collection or spring, winter and “00” winter oilseed rape were considered so that a sufficient number of varieties was included to estimate the ld.

the mean pairwise r <dig> was estimated at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the whole, the spring, the winter and the “00” winter oilseed rape collections, respectively. this corresponded to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the snp pairs showing a r <dig> value higher than  <dig>  . in the whole collection and the spring types, a high percentage of the pairs with a significant ld were between snp markers located on different chromosomes  whereas in the winter types, most were intra-chromosomic pairs. the r <dig> value was greater than  <dig>  for  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the pairs and greater than  <dig>  for less than  <dig> % of the pairs. very few pairs with r2 >  <dig>  were observed between snp markers located on different chromosomes.

ld decay was estimated globally and for each linkage groups from the four collections. the non-linear regression of the ld measure  relative to genetic map distance and the genetic distance at which the estimated r <dig> fell below  <dig> , as well as the effective size, were estimated . the trend lines of these non-linear regressions are shown in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  the genetic distance at which the estimated r <dig> fell below  <dig>  was  <dig> - <dig>  cm for the whole collection, the spring and winter types whether it was estimated on the whole genome or the a and c genomes. however on the c genome for the spring types, this distance was estimated at  <dig>  cm. for the “00” winter types, it was estimated at  <dig>  cm on the whole genome as well as on the genomes a or c. this value varied depending on the linkage group and the collection, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. on all the linkage groups, the extent of ld was overall higher for the “00” winter types than for the winter types that included the “++”, “0+” and “00” varieties. different linkage groups showed a higher extent of ld depending on whether it was estimated from the spring or the winter types e.g. a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> for the spring types and a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and c <dig> for the winter types. the effective size varied accordingly. the very different ld patterns between spring and winter types was also evident from the ld plots obtained for each linkage group. this was true for the linkage groups cited above such as for c <dig>  but some other differences could be seen on most of the groups .

discussion
in this study, we could built a high density snp integrated b. napus map and depict polymorphism level and ld decay over the linkage groups across different b. napus collections by integrating genotyping data of a large set of snps in both segregating populations and diverse collections.

as reviewed by kaur et al.  <cit> , snp discovery is challenging in allopolyploid species such as b. napus. snps may arise both between allelic  sequences within subgenomes and between homoeologous sequences among subgenomes but also from polymorphisms between paralogous duplicated sequences. snp discovery has been based on b. napus ests sequence analysis  <cit>  or on second generation high throughput sequencing  <cit> . snp genotyping using illumina goldengate assays was shown to be possible in b. napus species after careful selection of the snp  <cit> . here, we report the first high throughput genotyping study in oilseed rape using illumina infinium and goldengate technology. from the  <dig> snps tested on the two platforms,  <dig> were validated on both, suggesting that it should be possible to use one platform or the other depending on the required number of snps.

in this study, we generated an integrated map with  <dig> markers including  <dig> snps, which corresponds to  <dig>  markers every cm. this large number of mapped markers was obtained by integrating four mapping populations. marker density actually increased from one marker  every  <dig>   cm on the individual maps to one marker  every  <dig>   cm on the integrated map. this density was comparable to that obtained in wang et al.  <cit>   but the number of markers in common between populations was much higher in our study . the size of the population was also larger in our study, which led to a more accurate ordering of the markers on the integrated map. bancroft et al.  <cit>  built a b. napus map with  <dig> snps by transcriptome sequencing of  <dig> tndh lines. these snp were distributed in  <dig> recombination bins . our integrated maps exhibited  <dig> bin loci , thus the mapping resolution increased considerably with the increase in population size. the collinearity blocks we identified were compared to those reported in panjabi et al.  <cit> , parkin  <cit> , wang et al.  <cit>  and bancroft et al.  <cit> . compared to bancroft et al.  <cit> , which is at present the most complete study, five and  <dig> small blocks were missing on the a and c genomes, respectively. nevertheless, three new blocks were identified in our study: s on a <dig>  v-w on c <dig> and b on c <dig>  in bancroft’s study, two markers corresponding to these blocks were identified but not declared as a block. moreover, the v-w and b blocks were identified in the homoeologous regions on a <dig> and a <dig> linkage groups, which supports their occurrence in these genomic regions.

a higher number of markers was mapped on the a genome than on the c genome, as previously reported by bancroft et al.  <cit> . as in their study, here, this difference between the a and c genomes was more pronounced on the three crosses involving asiatic parental lines. the hypothesis is that asiatic cultivars are partly derived from crosses involving its progenitor species b. rapa <cit> , which increased the genetic diversity of the a genome. this introgression of b. rapa genetic information was recently shown for ‘nignyou7’  by bancroft et al.  <cit> . indeed, there was less difference between the number of markers mapped on the a and c genomes in the amdh population which is derived from a cross between two french winter osr varieties. no such difference was observed in wang et al.  <cit>  but the markers mapped in their study were mainly contributed by two crosses involving resynthetised b. napus, which is enriched in polymorphisms in both genomes. we probably succeeded in capturing this high level of polymorphism on the a genome because the original sequencing to identify the snp was performed on material that included asiatic varieties.

we observed a high level of segregation distortion especially in the dydh and tndy populations. such segregation distortions were reported in many b. napus maps . segregation distortion and clustering of the skewed loci are common features of microspore-derived dh populations in various species , including oilseed rape and may be related to differential responsiveness to microspore culture between the two parental lines, which leads to skewed loci in regions involved in the microspore culture responsiveness.

very good collinearity was observed between all the individual maps, which made it easy to integrate the four individual maps accurately. only three inversions were identified on the a <dig> and c <dig> linkage groups. these inversions could be due to mapping inaccuracies and need to be confirmed. due to careful selection at the beginning of the study to target homologous snps, very few snps were not assigned a position on the same linkage groups among the different maps. those snps that did map to different linkage groups were located in duplicated regions within or between the a and c genomes where there is a high level sequence similarity. the map derived from the aadh population was 75% bigger than those derived from the other crosses, which was expected from the way the dh population was obtained. dh lines were produced after intermating f <dig> plants, which increased the number of recombination events. this type of highly recombinant population is of interest for obtaining better mapping resolution  <cit> . the map derived from the amdh population was the least dense with some regions missing, due to the lack of polymorphism between the two parental lines. in many cases, the monomorphic regions corresponded to quite complete b. napus/arabidopsis collinearity blocks. the lower marker density can be related to the lower level of polymorphism revealed within winter oilseed rape or “00” winter oilseed rape compared with spring oilseed rape.

a moderate level of differentiation was observed between the different b. napus types  as revealed by the estimated differentiation indices . a similar result was reported by bus et al.  <cit> . they used  <dig> ssr primer combinations to assess the diversity in a set of  <dig> oilseed rape lines which included wosr, sosr, fodder and swede rape lines from diverse origins. xiao et al.  <cit>  found a lower level of differentiation between their groups defined from a collection of  <dig> oilseed rape lines genotyped with  <dig> ssr markers. however, each of their groups, as defined by structure analysis, was constituted of lines from china, europe, canada and australia. within the sosr and wosr groups, a very low level of differentiation was observed between the three subgroups which corresponded to the three quality types  with 91% and 83% of the variation present within the subgroups in wosr and sosr, respectively. examination of the collection structure with pca showed distinct clustering of wosr, sosr and fodder rape lines while the first two axes did not account for a large part of the variation . this differentiation was previously reported by diers and osborn  <cit> , hasan et al.  <cit>  and bus et al.  <cit>  and can be related to the relatively distinct breeding history between these pools and their adaptation to different environments or uses. however, our data allowed two groups to be differentiated within sosr which mainly contained european and canadian or asian spring oilseed rape, thus corresponding to a differentiation due to geographic origin. some sosr lines were located at an intermediate position between these two groups such as ‘grouse’ and ‘marnoo’ , ‘chine wuhan’ and ‘yeong dang’  or ‘industry’ . no such differentiation was observed within the wosr lines which all originated from europe, as previously reported by ecke et al.  <cit>  and bus et al.  <cit> . fodder rape lines were located at an intermediate position between sosr and wosr although closer to wosr than to sosr. the exception was ‘liho’ which is a spring fodder rape and grouped with the sosr. this result is consistent with the fact that fodder types and oilseed types were derived from the same ancestral spring and winter pools and were bred for different uses, as reported by bus et al.  <cit> . the same structuration was obtained whether we consider snps from the a or the c genomes. the percentage of variation accounted for by the first two axes was higher with the snps from the a than from the c genome when we used the whole snp set where the markers from the a genome were overrepresented. when we considered the  <dig> chosen snp markers, the percentage of variation accounted for by the first two axes was similar with the snps from both genomes, indicating that an overrepresentation of markers in some regions can biased the results. a selection of evenly spaced markers over all the linkage groups is thus recommended for genetic structuration. the optimal number has to be assessed by testing different sample sizes.

to assess the genetic diversity in the collection and within the different germplasm groups, we examined the mean pic and its evolution along each linkage group. the pic values ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  depending on the position on the linkage groups and depending on the collections used. similar observations were made in barley and maize with the same type of markers  <cit> . our set of snps was only derived from exonic sequences, which could have lowered the level of revealed diversity compared to intronic snps  <cit> . on average, pic values were lower in wosr than in sosr. this difference was more important for snps derived from the a genome rather than the c genome. this might be because the sosr lines have more diverse geographic origins than the wosr lines and have undergone differential selection to adapt to the different continents. in wosr, the mean pic values were not very different between the three seed quality types. the mean pic value was only slightly higher in “++” wosr type but this result should be taken with caution due to the different sizes of the three subgroups. bus et al.  <cit>  reported a lower genetic diversity for “00” seed quality wosr varieties and the difference was also quite low. the variation in pic values along the different linkage groups between the three wosr seed quality types was very contrasted, with more numerous regions showing a pic decrease for the “0+” and/or “00” types. these variations could be related to potential selection signatures within and between these types. in barley, specific chromosomal regions exhibited contrasting levels of diversity in different germplasm subgroups. a region of reduced diversity in winter barley in the central part of chromosome 5h was attributed to the small number of founding genotypes that contributed to the winter seasonal growth habit locus hrn- <dig>  similarly, an abrupt decrease in diversity on the short arm of chromosome 3h observed in all groups coincided with the locus of non-shattering of ears after ripening  <cit> . we therefore investigated whether the regions with reduced diversity in either the “0+” and /or the “00” subgroups could be related to the position of genes controlling erucic acid and glucosinolate content. erucic acid genes are located on a <dig> and c <dig>  numerous genes are involved in the glucosinolate pathway  <cit>  but the major qtl controlling total glucosinolate content are located on a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  <cit> , delourme, unpubl. data. their positions are indicated in additional file 2: table  <dig>  however, there was no decrease in diversity clearly surrounding erucic acid genes in the “0+” and the “00” subgroups or total glucosinolate qtl in the “00” subgroup. the only exception could be at the top of c <dig>  it can be hypothesized that many recombination events have occurred around the selected genes in these regions during different rounds of intercrossing between the varieties since the original crosses were made with the genitors of low erucic and low glucosinolate content. significant decreases in diversity were observed in other regions, which could be related to breeding for other agronomical traits but a more precise investigation of qtl located in these regions should be made before drawing any conclusions.

the mean pairwise r <dig> values are close to previous estimates of  <dig>   <cit>  or  <dig>   <cit>  and confirms the low overall level of linkage disequilibrium in b. napus. ld was observed to decay below a critical level  within a map distance between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm among the subgroups. this value is in accordance with previous studies performed either on smaller oilseed rape collections or with a smaller number of markers  <cit> . this level is lower than that detected in a collection of  <dig> wosr lines genotyped with  <dig> aflp markers, where the ld decayed within 2–3 cm at r2 <  <dig>   <cit> . this could be due to the fact that this latter collection comprised only “00” seed quality types. in our study, the extent of ld was also higher in the “00” wosr collection than in the whole wosr or the sosr collections. from the size of the genetic maps and of the genomes in brassica species, on average 1 cm can be roughly estimated to correspond to ~500 kb  <cit> . this means that on average for the whole genome, the extent of ld is between 300–1000 kb depending on the collections but great variations were observed across the linkage groups . in many species, ld decay varied across the germplasms used. for example, ld extends less than 1 kb for maize landraces  <cit>  and roughly 2 kb for diverse inbred maize lines  <cit>  but can be as high as 100 kb for commercial elite inbred lines  <cit> . ld decay can also vary considerably from locus to locus 1–4 kb  <cit>  up to 800 kb  <cit> . similar differences were observed in rice, 50–500 kb,  <cit> , arabidopsis, 10–250 kb  <cit>  or barley, 90–210 kb  <cit>  or 4–8 cm  <cit> . generally, the extent of ld is related to the mating system of the species, the breeding history of the species  and the genetic diversity of the different germplasms  <cit> . ld decay is more rapid in outcrossing species and in pools with higher genetic diversity. oilseed rape is bred as a selfing species and has undergone two bottlenecks for seed quality improvement , which led to a ld decay similar to other selfing species and to a higher ld extent in the “00” wosr collection.

the ld patterns varied greatly among the linkage groups and these variations were different between the sosr or wosr types. similar results were reported in maize  <cit> , barley  <cit>  or rice  <cit> . different patterns of ld along the chromosomes in various pools can be related to variation in recombination rate and in the history of recombination for specific chromosome regions within these pools. the centromeres were localised approximately on the integrated map by mapping centromeric markers developed by pouilly et al.  <cit>  to the dydh map. these were then included on the integrated map and on the ld heatmaps . on many linkage groups, ld seems to be extended across the centromeric regions as reported in barley  <cit>  but other regions which do not correspond to centromeres also showed extended ld such as on a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> or c <dig>  differences in allele frequencies  <cit>  could have also influenced the distribution of ld along the chromosomes. in barley, larger ld extent in some chromosomic regions was caused by markers with low allele frequencies  <cit> . in rice, ld decay rates in indica and japonica subspecies were only weakly correlated across the genome in relation to a relatively long history of partial reproductive isolation of these self-fertilized subspecies  <cit> . since sosr and wosr have a relatively distinct breeding history, a similar hypothesis can also be proposed in our case.

CONCLUSIONS
with high throughput snp genotyping on four segregating dh populations, we developed an integrated genetic map for oilseed rape that comprises  <dig> snp and  <dig> pcr markers. this significantly improves the marker density or mapping accuracy compared to previously published genetic maps. the genotyping of these mapped snp markers in collections allowed polymorphism level and linkage disequilibrium to be studied in oilseed rape. both were shown to vary across the different collections  and across the linkage groups. taking into account the length of the genetic map  and the mean ld extent , a relatively low number of evenly spaced snps  would be necessary to perform genome wide association studies in oilseed rape. however, this number should be adjusted to obtain a sufficient snp density throughout the genome and to take into account the variation in ld along the linkage groups. a set of  <dig> public snps was set up, of which 72% were validated on a goldengate platform. they provide evenly spaced snps showing a good level of polymorphism in oilseed rape. information regarding the other snps can be requested from j pauquet . our study provides a valuable resource for further genetic studies through linkage or association mapping, marker assisted breeding and brassica sequence assembly and comparative mapping.
