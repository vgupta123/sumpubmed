BACKGROUND
arabinogalactan-proteins  are members of the hydroxyproline -rich cell wall glycoprotein superfamily and are hyperglycosylated by o-linked ag polysaccharides. agps are found in cell walls, plasma membranes, and extracellular secretions of virtually all plant cells, tissues and organ types  <cit> . moderately sized gene families encode a variety of agp protein backbones throughout the plant kingdom. for example, based on bioinformatics studies, arabidopsis contains  <dig> agp genes, while rice contains  <dig> agp genes  <cit> . moreover, these genes are spatially and temporally expressed in a variety of patterns, which likely relates to their multiple functions.

agps are implicated to function in various aspects of plant growth and development, including root elongation, somatic embryogenesis, hormone responses, xylem differentiation, pollen tube growth and guidance, programmed cell death, cell expansion, salt tolerance, host-pathogen interactions, and cellular signaling . however, there remains a lack of understanding of the biophysical and biochemical modes of action of any individual agp. this lack of understanding regarding function also extends to the carbohydrate moieties or ag polysaccharides, which extensively decorate agp core proteins and largely define their interactive surfaces.

given the importance of understanding plant cell wall biosynthesis particularly with respect to biofuel production, much of the recent work on agps has focused on their biosynthesis. such efforts have identified several of the biosynthetic glycosyltransferase  genes/enzymes responsible for ag polysaccharide production  <cit> . in particular, the following enzymes were identified and cloned: two α- <dig> -fucosyltransferases  which are members of the cazy gt- <dig> family , two hydroxyproline-o-galactosyltransferases  which are members of gt- <dig> and contain a galectin domain  <cit> , three other hydroxyproline-o-galactosyltransferases  which are members of gt- <dig> but lack a galectin domain  <cit> , one β- <dig> -galactosyltransferase  which is a member of gt- <dig>  <cit> , one β- <dig> -galactosyltransferase with elongation activity which is a member of gt- <dig>   <cit> , one β- <dig> -galactosyltransferase with branch initiation and branch elongating activities which is a member of gt- <dig>   <cit> , three β- <dig> -gluronosyltransferases which are members of gt- <dig>   <cit> , and a putative agp β-arabinosyltransferase  which is a member of the gt- <dig> family  <cit> .

the hydroxyproline-o-galactosyltransferases  that add galactose onto the peptidyl hyp residues in agp core proteins represent the first committed step in ag polysaccharide addition and represent an ideal control point to investigate the contribution of ag polysaccharides to agp function. previously, we demonstrated that galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  are members of a small multigene family and encode hyp-galts  <cit> . in addition, extensive phenotypic characterization of allelic galt <dig> and galt <dig> single mutants and galt2galt <dig> double mutants at the biochemical and physiological levels was performed which corroborated the roles of these two enzymes in ag biosynthesis and elucidated the contributions of ag polysaccharides to agp function. here, we extend that work by characterizing the remaining galt members  of this small six-membered gene family, which are distinguished by encoding a galt domain as well as a galectin domain.

RESULTS
in silico analysis of galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt6
this study focused on the six-member gene/protein family in arabidopsis, which is found within the cazy gt <dig> family and distinguished by the presence of both a galt  and a galectin  domain. recently, two of these six members, galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  were demonstrated to catalyze the addition of galactose onto hyp residues of agp backbones  <cit> . another member of this family, galt <dig>  encoded by at1g <dig>  was previously characterized and identified as a β– <dig> -galactosyltransferase involved in the formation of the lewis a epitope on n–linked glycans  <cit> . the open reading frames of the remaining members, at3g <dig> , at1g <dig> , and at5g <dig>  correspond to  <dig>   <dig> and 2046 bp and specify proteins with  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  amino acids, respectively . the six proteins share amino acid identities ranging from  <dig> to 70 % . in addition, comparisons of these six members were performed with the three recently identified agp-specific hyp-o-galts , which are also within the gt <dig> family and contain a galt domain but lack a galectin domain  <cit> . all nine proteins were predicted to be type ii golgi localized integral membrane proteins by several subcellular localization prediction programs   <cit> , additional file 1: table s2). these nine galts were also submitted the tmhmm server  for prediction of transmembrane domains , a typical type ii membrane topology commonly found in gts  <cit>  . all were predicted to have a single tmd except for galt <dig>  hpgt <dig>  and hpgt <dig>  which instead contained hydrophobic regions that may serve as an anchor to the golgi membrane. hydrophobic cluster analysis  was performed by submitting the protein sequences to the drawhca server  and used to identify the hydrophobic pockets containing the “dxd” motifs of the six galts; this analysis also included two previously characterized agp-related gt <dig> members, galt31a and at1g <dig>  which are involved with the elongation of β- <dig> -galactan side chains and the β- <dig>  backbone of ag polysaccharides, respectively   <cit> . hca analysis revealed conserved ddd motifs in all the proteins contained within various hydrophobic pockets. the dxd motif is implicated in the binding the divalent metal ion that assists in anchoring the pyrophosphoryl group of the udp-sugar donor in the enzyme’s active site  <cit> . co-expression analysis was performed using genemania  and revealed that galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> expression is tightly correlated with well-characterized agp-specific gt <dig> members as well as with a number of agps   <cit> .

transiently expressed galt genes in nicotiana have agp-specific hyp-o-galt activity
for biochemical characterization, full-length galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> gene constructions, each harboring an n-terminal 6xhis tag, were transiently expressed in the leaves of nicotiana tabacum. leaves infiltrated with desired constructs were initially separated into three fractions: supernatant, total microsomal membranes and golgi-enriched microsomal membranes. the highest galt activity was observed in golgi-enriched detergent permeablized microsomal membranes , and thus this fraction was subsequently used as the enzyme source in transient assays . here, five of the six galts  displayed hyp-o-galt activity, when compared to controls . previously characterized galt <dig> and galt <dig> were used as positive controls for this assay, while galt <dig> effectively served as a negative control, given its involvement with n-glycan biosynthesis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> hyp-o-galt activity of galt1-galt <dig> transiently expressed in n. tabacum. galt1-galt <dig> were expressed in epidermal cells of tobacco leaves by agrobacterium-mediated transient expression, which were used for the preparation of golgi-enriched microsomal membrane proteins for the hyp-galt assays. synthetic peptide  <dig> was used as substrate acceptor. wt tobacco leaves infiltrated with agrobacterium gv <dig> strain , wt tobacco leaves, and wt tobacco leaves infiltrated with st fused with gfp were used as controls. experiments were performed using duplicate samples and data represent the mean ± sd from two independent experiments. asterisks indicate mean values significantly different from the wt 



substrate specificities of galt2-galt6
various potential substrate acceptors were tested to investigate enzyme specificity of galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  namely,  <dig>   <dig>  and d <dig>  consisting of non-contiguous peptidyl hyp residues, were used to examine the effect of these model agp peptide sequences of various lengths on galt activity.  <dig>  consisting of alternating ala and pro residues, was tested for the requirement of peptidyl hyp for galactosylation. extp, a chemically synthesized extensin peptide consisting of contiguous peptidyl hyp residues, tested whether contiguous peptidyl hyp residues act as potential acceptors. two commercially available pectic polysaccharides, rhamnogalactan i from potato and rhamnogalactan  from soybean, were also tested as potential substrates acceptors. all the non–agp substrate acceptors, including  <dig>  failed to incorporate gal, indicating the galt activity was specific for agp sequences containing non-contiguous peptidyl hyp . it is interesting to note that galt <dig> and galt <dig> expressed in tobacco displayed higher activity than when expressed in pichia, even after taking into account the relatively high background activity in tobacco. this indicates that there are plant-specific factors or accessory proteins critical for hyp-o-galt activity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> substrate specificity of transiently expressed galt2- <dig>  detergent permeablized tobacco microsomal membranes obtained from transiently expressed galt2- <dig> served as the enzyme source in the galt reactions. various peptide and polysaccharide acceptor substrates were tested including: 1)  <dig>   <dig>  and d <dig> which contain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  units, respectively, 2) a chemically synthesized extensin peptide  containing repetitive so <dig> units, 3)  <dig> which contains  <dig>  units, 4) rhamnogalactan i  from potato pectin, and 5) rg from soybean pectin. microsomes obtained from wt tobacco leaves infiltrated with empty pmdc <dig> vector were used as a negative control and depicted as wt. enzyme reactions were done in triplicate and mean values ± se are presented. asterisks indicate values significantly different from the wt 



additional biochemical characterization of hyp-o-galts
heterologously expressed hyp-o-galts required the divalent cation mn+ <dig> for maximal activity and utilized udp- galactose solely as the sugar donor . this is in contrast to galt <dig> and galt <dig> expressed in pichia, which required mg+ <dig> for its optimal activity  <cit> .

expression profiles of the hyp-o-galt genes
qrt-pcr and data mining of public databases were used to analyze expression profiles of the hyp-o-galt genes. qrt-pcr analysis indicated that galt1-galt <dig> are broadly expressed and have overlapping but distinct expression patterns . these q-pcr data were in good agreement with public expression data available from genevestigator and the efp browser  <cit>  as well as from the previous study by strasser et al.  <cit>  . data from large-scale transcriptomic databases were used to provide insight into galt expression and provide clues as to where to focus phenotypic analysis of galt knockout mutant plants. notable patterns of expression were as follows: highest expression of galt <dig> was observed in senescent leaves followed by seed, seed coat, root hairs, flowers, and siliques, whereas galt <dig> was predominantly expressed in young flowers, mature flowers with siliques and mature siliques. galt <dig> was abundant in roots, mature pollen, and hypocotyl .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of the six membered galt gene family. qpcr analysis of galt1-galt <dig> expression arabidopsis organs and cell cultures. roots were obtained from 14 day old seedlings grown on ms plates with 1 % sucrose and a week old cell suspension culture was used for rna extraction. the level of expression was calculated relative to the ubq <dig> gene 



numerous studies indicate that pollen tubes undergo dramatic transformations while growing in the pistil, where they rapidly grow, perceive and respond to navigational cues secreted by the pistil, with agps playing a critical role in such interactions . nonetheless, genes expressed by pollen tubes in response to growth in the pistil are poorly characterized. qin et al.  <cit>  utilized the novel combination of semi in vitro pollination followed by microarray analysis to identify genes specifically involved in pollen-pistil interaction, including the hyp-o-galts. galt <dig> had the highest expression followed by galt <dig> and galt <dig>  whereas hpgt <dig> was only expressed in later stages of pollen elongation. furthermore, it is interesting to note that there was a temporal difference in the expression patterns of these hyp-o-galts during pollen elongation .

in addition, transcriptome analyses using rna extracted from laser-capture dissected seed coat tissue  indicated that all five hyp-o-galt transcript levels displayed unique expression patterns in the seed coat during embryogenesis   <cit> . notably, galt <dig> was expressed throughout seed development, while expression of galt <dig> and galt <dig> transcripts was higher in the early stages compared to the later stages of seed development. in contrast, galt <dig> was only observed at later stages of seed development, while galt <dig> showed the least expression in seeds.

galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> are targeted to golgi vesicles
transient expression of c-terminal yfp fusions to galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> were infiltrated in n. tobaccum epidermal leaf cells to examine the subcellular localization of these enzymes . overlays of galt3-yfp, galt4-yfp, and galt6-yfp individually co-expressed with the golgi marker protein, sialyl transferase, fused to gfp  indicated that all three galts were localized to the golgi apparatus. furthermore, the possibility that they were localized in the er was excluded, as the galt-yfp fusion constructions were not co-localized with the er marker, hdel fused with gfp . singly infiltrated controls for st-gfp, hdel-gfp, and galt-yfp were analyzed to optimize gain and pinhole settings for each channel and to exclude any bleed through fluorescence between channels .fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of transiently expressed galt3-yfp, galt4-yfp, and galt6-yfp in n. tabacum. galt3-yfp, galt4-yfp, and galt6-yfp fusion constructions were expressed under the control of the camv 35s promoter in n. tabacum. transiently expressed galt3-yfp, galt4-yfp, and galt6-yfp co-localized with sialyl transferase -gfp fusion protein , but not with hdel-gfp fusion protein . these constructs were examined by laser-scanning confocal microscopy under fluorescent and white light, and the fluorescent images were merged to observe co-localization. size bar = 10 μm



galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants show agp biochemical defects
two independent allelic mutant lines with t-dna insertions were identified for each of the six galt genes in order to examine the biochemical roles of the hyp-o-galts in vivo. homozygous mutants were generated, identified by pcr, and confirmed by sequencing . rt-pcr and qrt-pcr analysis showed that virtually no transcripts could be detected in the mutants . significant reductions in galt activity as well as β-gal-yariv precipitable agps obtained from 14-d old seedlings were observed in knock-out mutants of galt <dig> , galt <dig> , and galt <dig>  compared to wt . such reductions were previously reported for knock-out mutants of galt <dig> , galt <dig> , and a galt2galt <dig> double mutant and were used here as positive controls  <cit> . consistent with the findings that galt <dig> synthesizes lewis a structures and lacks hyp-o-galt activity , knock-out mutants of galt <dig>  demonstrated no such reductions and were indistinguishable from wt   <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic gene models, locations of t-dna mutant insertions, and transcript analysis of galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  a

detergent-solubilized microsomal fractions were used for performing a standard hyp-galt assay, and agps were extracted, precipitated by β-gal-yariv reagent, and quantified from 14-day-old plants. the values are averages of at least two independent experiments from two biological replicates. letters ‘a’ and ‘b’ denote a significant difference from the wild type  respectively



given the differential expression of these hyp-o-galts and the broad expression of agps, agps were also quantified from other organs in the mutants. similar patterns of reductions in β-gal-yariv precipitable agps were observed in these other organs for these mutants. in general, disruption of any of the five galts  caused a significant reduction in agp content, with most significant effects being exhibited by galt <dig> in stems, galt <dig> in siliques, and galt <dig> in senescent leaves . these data on agp quantification in the mutants were consistent with the expression profile data for galt2-galt <dig>  profiles of these β-gal-yariv precipitable agps produced by rp-hplc were also examined for various galt mutants and revealed that virtually all these agps, as opposed to a single or subset of these agps, were affected when compared to wt or galt <dig> control profiles . furthermore, the agp peaks in the galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants eluted later and thus had less glycosylated protein compared to the wt or galt <dig> control agp peaks, consistent with reduced hyp-galactosylation.table  <dig> amount of β-gal-yariv precipitated agps in wt and galt mutants

galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants exhibit root hair defects
to investigate the physiological function of these six galts in vivo, mutants were grown on ms plates and compared to wt. no significant phenotypic differences in primary root growth were observed with the exception of the root hairs. single mutant knock-out lines for galt <dig>  as well as for galt <dig> and galt <dig> and the galt2galt <dig> double mutant, consistently displayed shorter and less dense root hairs compared to wt; knock-out lines for galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> displayed either less severe or no such root hair phenotypes .fig.  <dig> root hair length and density reduced in the galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants. a wt, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> plants were grown on ms agar plates for 10 days. bar = 1 mm. b quantification of root hair length and c root hair density of the galt mutants. asterisks indicate significantly reduced root hair length and density compared with wt controls according to dunnett’s test 



galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants display reduced seed set
the galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants displayed a  <dig> and 13 % reduction in seed set, respectively . reciprocal crosses of the galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants to wild type plants were performed to determine whether this defect was conferred by the male or female gametophyte. such crosses indicated that the male gametophyte of these mutants was mainly responsible for conferring reduced seed set . pollen were consequently examined with alexander’s stain which indicated that pollen were viable . furthermore, in vitro pollen germination did not exhibit altered germination frequency in galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants compared to wt .fig.  <dig> silique morphology of galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutant plants along with reciprocal crosses of these mutants to wt plants. siliques were treated with ethanol to allow for easy observation of the seeds. absence of ovules is indicated with an asterisk. bar = 100 μm

galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants demonstrate reduced staining of adherent seed coat mucilage
prior evidence for the involvement of agps  and galt2/galt <dig> in seed coat mucilage prompted an examination of the potential functions of galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> in modifying seed coat mucilage  <cit> . the effect of disruption of the six galt gene family members on adherent seed mucilage was investigated by staining hydrated seeds with ruthenium red, which stains negatively charged biopolymers such as pectin  <cit> . the galt3- <dig>  galt3- <dig>  galt6- <dig>  galt6- <dig>  and galt2galt <dig> mutant seeds showed a thin staining pattern of the adherent mucilage, whereas wt, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> seeds showed an intense, regular, spherical staining pattern . in addition, adherent mucilage mass and volume were measured to confirm the reduction of adherent mucilage thickness. no difference was observed in adherent mucilage mass between wt and galt single and double mutant seeds, whereas the adherent mucilage size of galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt2galt <dig> was substantially reduced  compared with wt . in contrast, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants were less dramatically altered  compared to wt.fig.  <dig> pectin staining of seed coat mucilage in wild type, galt1-galt <dig> single mutants, and galt2galt <dig> double mutants. seeds of the indicated genotypes were prehydrated with water for 90 min and stained with ruthenium red to visualize pectin using a nikon phot-lab <dig> microscope coupled with a spot rt color ccd camera and spot  <dig>  analysis software. bar = 100 μm

galt <dig> mutants demonstrate premature senescence
only the galt <dig> mutants  displayed early onset of senescence compared to wt and the other galt mutants. this was visualized by premature yellowing of leaves and was correlated with a slightly greater reduction in chlorophyll content and protein content in galt <dig> mutants compared to wt . these observations were consistent with the abundance of galt <dig> transcripts in senescent leaves as well as with the markedly greater reduction of β-gal-yariv precipitable agps in galt <dig> senescent leaves .

galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants exhibit pollen tube and root growth which is less sensitive to β-gal-yariv reagent
the galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants displayed reduced inhibition of pollen tube and root growth elongation in response to β-gal-yariv reagent compared to wt or α-gal-yariv reagent control treatments . as expected, galt <dig> mutants did not exhibit any difference in either pollen tube or root growth elongation compared to wt. moreover, no significant difference in pollen tube or primary root growth elongation was observed in unsupplemented germination media, indicating the conditional nature of this phenotype .fig.  <dig> the galt single mutants demonstrate reduced inhibition of pollen tube growth in the presence of β-gal-yariv reagent. a representative images of pollen tubes from wt, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants after 16 h in pollen germination medium, and b in pollen germination medium supplemented with 30 μm α-gal-yariv, and c in pollen germination medium supplemented with 30 μm β-gal-yariv reagent. bar = 50 μm. d pollen tube lengths from wt, galt1-galt <dig> mutants, and galt2galt <dig> double mutants were measured over 16 h in the pollen germination medium supplemented with 30 μm β-gal-yariv reagent. twenty flowers from each genotype and  <dig> pollen tubes from each flower were measured using image j software. the experiment was done in triplicate, and the asterisks indicate mean values significantly different from the wt

conditional salt hypersensitive phenotypes of the galt mutants
galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  mutants, and to a lesser extent the galt <dig>  mutants, exhibited significant reductions in root elongation compared to wt when grown in the presence of  <dig> and 150 mm nacl . such reductions in root elongation were previously reported for knock-out mutants of galt <dig> , galt <dig> , and the galt2galt <dig> double mutant  <cit> . as expected, galt <dig> mutants did not show salt hypersensitive growth and were indistinguishable from wt in this assay. the galt single and double mutants were not sensitive to osmotic stress as illustrated by mannitol .fig.  <dig> salt-induced inhibition of primary root elongation in galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants. five-day-old wt, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> seedlings germinated on ms medium were transferred onto media containing 100 mm nacl and grown vertically. root elongation  was measured after  <dig>   <dig>  and 21 days of growth in the non-permissive media. data are the means ± se of measurements from five independent experiments . asterisks indicate mean values significantly different from the wt 



microscopic examination of the galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and to a lesser extent the galt <dig> mutants also revealed defective anisotropic root tip growth  in the presence of 100 mm nacl, which was not observed in wt and galt <dig> mutants . such salt hypersensitive root tip swelling responses were previously reported in galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt2galt <dig> mutants and were included here as positive controls  <cit> .

a root bending assay was used as another means to evaluate salt hypersensitivity of the galt mutants . this assay is commonly used by plant researchers to evaluate salt sensitivity/tolerance and involves monitoring root growth reorientation after a  <dig> degree reorientation of the seedling to gravity. results of this experiment indicated that galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  mutants, and to a lesser extent the galt <dig>  mutants were slow to reorient their root growth compared to wt when grown in the presence of 100 mm nacl. such delayed reorientation was previously reported for knock-out mutants of galt <dig> , galt <dig> , and the galt2galt <dig> double mutant; these mutants were used here as positive controls  <cit> . as expected, galt <dig> mutants  reoriented quickly and were indistinguishable from wt in this assay.

discussion
galt2-galt <dig> encode hyp-galts for agps and are widely expressed in arabidopsis
bioinformatic approaches were previously used to identify a small, six-membered gene family within the gt  <dig> family of the cazy database as potential candidates for encoding hyp-o-galts for agps  <cit> . protein members of this family were designated galt1-galt <dig> and distinguished by the presence of a galt domain as well as a galectin domain. previously, galt <dig> was shown to catalyze galactose addition for formation of the lewis a epitope on n–linked glycans  <cit> , while galt <dig> and galt <dig> were shown to act as hyp-galts specific for agps  <cit> . in this study, biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> also act as hyp-galts for agps.

heterologous transient expression of galt1-galt <dig> in tobacco epidermal cells demonstrated a significant increase in hyp-galt activity compared with various tobacco control plants, with the notable exception of galt <dig> . the absence of hyp-o-galt activity over background levels in case of galt <dig> is consistent with its reported, non-agp related function and provided a useful control for the studies reported here  <cit> . moreover, this transient expression study in tobacco corroborates previous findings that galt <dig> and galt <dig>  which were expressed in pichia pastoris, act as agp-specific hyp-galts  <cit> . it should be noted that the amount of activity detected in these two heterologous expression systems varied; the tobacco system showed much higher levels of activity than the pichia system, even when taking into account the higher level of endogenous activity associated with the tobacco system. this observation could be explained by the need for other plant-based proteins or factors to enhance or optimize hyp-o-galt activity.

substrate specificity of galt2-galt <dig> was investigated using various potential acceptor substrates and demonstrated that galt2-galt <dig> is specific for model agp sequences . these findings are consistent with the hyp contiguity hypothesis, which states that clustered, non-contiguous hyp residues are sites of ag addition, whereas contiguous hyp residues are sites for the addition of ara oligosaccharides  <cit> . despite the higher enzyme activity observed in the transient tobacco expression system compared to pichia, the same size-dependent preference for agp substrates was observed for galt <dig> and galt <dig> in both systems, where  <dig> was the preferred substrate  <cit> . galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> also acted in a similar manner within the tobacco system.

heterologous transiently expressed galt2-galt <dig> in tobacco microsomes have similar biochemical properties to the galt present in arabidopsis microsomal membranes and to galt <dig> and galt <dig> expressed in pichia, specifically all require udp-gal as the sugar donor  <cit> . they have a requirement for mn2+ followed by mg2+ for their optimal activity, in contrast to mg2+ followed by mn2+ in pichia microsomes.

genetic mutant analysis provides additional in vivo evidence that galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> function as hyp-galts, similar to galt <dig> and galt <dig> . allelic galt knock-out mutants for all these genes exhibit reduced  hyp-galt activity and contain considerably less  glycosylated  agps. in addition, agp profiling of the galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants extends these findings and indicates that their activity is not limited to a particular agp or a small subset of agps, but instead broadly acts on coexpressed agps, similar to that previously reported for galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants .

qrt-pcr analysis of galt1-galt <dig> was performed to examine their expression patterns and provide information relevant to phenotypic analysis of their corresponding allelic mutants . all six genes were widely expressed, and in the cases of galt2-galt <dig> are consistent with the widespread distribution of agps and the multiple functions associated with them. these patterns were corroborated by searching public expression databases, which revealed even broader organ and tissue expression patterns . hpgt1-hpgt <dig>  three recently identified hyp-o-galts for agps that lack galectin domains, were also included in this analysis and showed equally broad patterns of gene expression  <cit> . nonetheless, within a given organ or tissue, the hyp-o-galt genes exhibit both temporal and spatial differences in their expression patterns. transcriptome analyses using rna extracted from laser-capture dissected seed coat tissue  <cit>  provides a particularly striking illustration of the diverse tissue-specific expression patterns of galt2-galt <dig> and hpgt1-hpgt <dig> .

galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> are localized to golgi vesicles
various approaches have indicated that agp glycosylation occurs in golgi vesicles. these approaches include bioinformatics predictions using signal p and golgi predictor, biochemical experiments on hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein  biosynthesis , a proteomics technique for localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging  <cit> , and localization studies performed with other agp gts, including galt <dig>  galt <dig>  hpgt1-hpgt <dig>  at1g <dig>  galt31a, galt29a, glcat14a, and fut <dig>  <cit> . given their similarity to galt <dig> and galt <dig> and their demonstrated hyp-galt activity, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> were expected to reside in the golgi vesicles, and this was confirmed by heterologous expression of fluorescently tagged protein fusions in tobacco leaves . interestingly, only galt <dig> is found in both the er and golgi, indicating that hyp-galactosylation may be initiated in the er, but completed in the golgi where the bulk of the hyp-o-galts are located  <cit> .

galt mutant phenotypes reveal functional roles of agp glycosylation in normal growth and development
genetic mutant analysis was used to investigate and compare the in vivo functional contributions of agp glycosylation by galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> with that of galt <dig> and galt <dig> . to date, a variety of functions are attributed to certain agps or gts acting on agps based on mutant analysis; these mutants show embryo lethality, conditional defects of primary root growth, cell elongation, and pollen tube growth   <cit> . like galt <dig> and galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> single mutant lines showed subtle or no detectable growth phenotypes under normal soil-based growth conditions, which is likely attributed to the functional redundancy within the galt2-galt <dig> gene family  <cit> . the phenotypes that were displayed by the single mutants here included reduced root hair length and/or density for galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> , reduced seed set for galt <dig> and galt <dig> , reduced adherent seed mucilage for galt <dig>  and galt <dig> , and accelerated leaf senescence for galt <dig> . although these phenotypes are consistent with the expression profiles of these genes, it would be difficult to predict such phenotypes from expression data alone. it is anticipated that double and multiple galt mutants will show more pronounced mutant phenotypes, as was the case when galt2galt <dig> double mutants were produced and characterized  <cit> .

with respect to root hair length and density, knock-out mutants of galt <dig> and to a lesser extent galt <dig> and galt <dig>  displayed shorter and/or less dense root hairs, indicating glycosylated agps play a role in tip growth of root hairs in arabidopsis . the galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt2galt <dig> double mutants also demonstrate this response and were used here as positive controls  <cit> . reduced density of root hairs can be attributed to an increase in longitudinal length of epidermal cells and/or to a decrease in the number of root hair-forming cells leading to the formation of less root hairs  <cit> . other studies, using β-gal-yariv reagent and prolyl hydroxylase genetic mutants, have also indicated that hrgps  are involved with root hair growth .

with respect to seed mucilage, galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants display the most significant decrease in the width of the adherent seed mucilage layer, along with galt <dig> and galt <dig> upon staining with ruthenium red when compared to wt seeds, which indicates that glycosylated agps are involved in maintaining the adherent mucilage layer in seeds . the galt2galt <dig> double mutants also demonstrate this response and were used here as positive controls  <cit> . harpaz-saad et al.  <cit>  reported that both fei <dig>  a cell wall leucine–rich receptor-like kinase and sos <dig>  a fasciclin like agp are critical for the synthesis and proper deposition of cellulosic rays in seed coat mucilage, which coincides with an increase in solubility of the pectinaceous component of seed coat mucilage. the galt <dig> expression profile during seed coat differentiation is identical to that of fei <dig>  moreover, galt <dig> is expressed at a higher level during late embryogenesis compared to the early embryogenesis stages, consistent with its involvement with seed coat development and in seed coat mucilage adherence. taken together, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  galt <dig> and galt <dig> likely glycosylate agps, like sos <dig>  that are essential for maintaining mucilage adherence in seeds during hydration.

with respect to seed set, galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants phenocopied knock-out mutants of two pollen-specific agps genes, agp <dig> and agp <dig>  in terms of reduction in number of seeds per silique, but not in abnormal pollen structures, although occasionally some collapsed pollen were observed in galt <dig> and galt <dig> mutants  this suggests galt <dig> and galt <dig> may be involved in glycosylation of pollen -specific agps. several studies have indicated that agps play key roles in pollen biogenesis, pollen tube growth and development, pollen tube guidance, and pollen–pistil interactions during post pollination events . indeed, a number of agp genes are reported to show pollen-specific expression in arabidopsis, including agp <dig>  agp <dig>  agp <dig>  and agp <dig>  reciprocal crosses of the mutants with wt confirmed that genetic transmission of this phenotype is contributed by the male gametophyte . in contrast, it is interesting to note that agp <dig> is reported to be essential for female gametogenesis, given that functional megaspores in rnai plants fail to enlarge and divide, resulting in ovule abortion and reduced seed set  <cit> .

with respect to leaf senescence, galt <dig> mutants displayed age-dependent early onset of leaf senescence, indicating agp glycosylation is related to plant aging . several lines of evidence implicate the involvement of agps in regulating programmed cell death and senescence . for example, β-gal-yariv treatment is known to promote programmed plant cell death, while overexpressing agps results in tomato plants with enhanced lifespans  <cit> . in this context, it is noteworthy that galt <dig> is highly expressed in senescing leaf tissue and that only galt <dig> mutants demonstrate a significant reduction in the β-gal-yariv precipitable agps in senescent leaves .

any one defect leading to reduced ag glycosylation is likely to impair the function of multiple agps, leading to pleiotropic effects as observed here. at least some of the genes involved in agp glycosylation, however, exist in small redundant or partially redundant genes families and may compensate for one another when a given gene in the family is knocked out . in some cases, aberrant phenotypes may not be discernable under normal conditions, but may be revealed under suboptimal growth conditions.

conditional phenotypes indicate galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> function in tip growth
the galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants display several conditional pollen and root phenotypes in response to β-gal-yariv treatment or salt treatment similar to those observed in galt <dig> and galt <dig> single mutants as well as galt2galt <dig> double mutants  <cit> . in both pollen tubes and roots, β-gal-yariv treatment is known to bind agps, specifically to their β- <dig> -galactan chains, and inhibit pollen tube and root elongation  indicating agps are important for such growth. this inhibition is alleviated in single mutants, which have reduced agp glycosylation due to the lack of respective galts . under normal conditions , no inhibition is observed in the single mutants, most likely due to gene redundancy, a conclusion supported by the observation that galt2galt <dig> double mutants show inhibition under normal conditions  <cit> . thus, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  like galt <dig> and galt <dig>  are important for pollen tube and root growth and indicate that the ag polysaccharides are required for these growth functions.

in roots, salt treatment results in reduced root growth, which can be measured directly or by the root bending assay, which is commonly used to screen plants or mutants for salt sensitivity. here, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig> mutants display salt hypersensitive root growth in both of these assays . thus, galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  like galt <dig> and galt <dig>  function in root growth and indicate the importance of ag polysaccharides in this process. galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  like galt <dig> and galt <dig>  also function to prevent root tip swelling in response to salt stress . since sos <dig>  a fasciclin-like agp, and fei <dig> and fei <dig>  two cell wall receptor-like kinases, also prevent such root tip swelling, and are in the same genetic pathway as galt <dig> and galt <dig>  it appears that agp glycosylation via any of the five galts  likely generates a carbohydrate signal on sos <dig>  which is detected and transduced by the fei1/fei <dig> kinases to promote cell wall integrity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, biochemical and genetic evidence presented here indicates that galt <dig>  galt <dig>  and galt <dig>  like galt <dig> and galt <dig>  function as agp-specific hyp-galts. the largely, but not completely, overlapping pleiotropic effects observed in genetic null mutants for each of the genes with respect to multiple aspects of plant growth, development, and reproduction indicate the importance of ag polysaccharides to the functions of agps. thus, these hyp-galt genes function in a largely redundant manner, and it is anticipated that more severe biochemical and physiological phenotypes will occur when multiple genetic mutants are studied, revealing additional agp functions. indeed, future work aimed at examining such multiple mutants, the role of the galectin domain, the potential for enzyme complex formation between and among hyp-galts and other gts involved with agp biosynthesis, hyp-galt/agp trafficking, and the potential signaling roles of ag polysaccharides will provide deeper insight to the evolution and biology of this small enzyme family and the agp family members that serve as their substrates.
