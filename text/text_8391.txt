BACKGROUND
polychlorinated biphenyls  are a class of compounds composed of  <dig> congeners previously used as industrial chemicals, for example in electrical equipment as flame retardants, in paints, pesticides, lubricants and sealants  <cit> . although pcbs were banned in the late 1970s in the western world, they are still one of the most problematic environmental contaminants due to their extreme persistence in the environment  <cit> . because of their lipophilic nature and resistance to metabolic degradation, pcbs bioaccumulate in animals and biomagnify in the food chain  <cit> . consumption of fish from contaminated areas is one of the main sources of exposure to humans  <cit> . based on chemical structure, pcbs are classified into two major groups with different modes of toxicity, i.e. the dioxin-like co-planar pcbs that bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor   and the non-coplanar pcbs such as pcb  <dig>  <cit> . the co-planar pcbs have toxicity mechanisms mainly mediated by ahr, with a range of toxic effects including carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, immune suppression and endocrine disruption  <cit> . the non-coplanar pcbs such as pcb  <dig> do not bind to and activate ahr, and their mechanisms of toxicity are at present less well understood. the non-coplanar pcbs such as pcb  <dig> may act via the steroid and xenobiotic receptor , also known as pregnane x receptor , and the constitutive androstane receptor   <cit> .

pcb  <dig> is one of the pcb congeners often detectable in biological samples  <cit> , and it is commonly used as a representative compound for the non-dioxin-like  pcb congeners in toxicological investigations. it is among the most persistent congeners, with residence time in the environment exceeding 100 years  <cit> . toxic effects of pcb  <dig> include possible endocrine disruption  <cit> , neurotoxicity  <cit> , and liver tumor promotion  <cit> . accumulating evidences suggest that pcbs and other persistent organic pollutants  may also act as metabolic disruptors contributing to growing incidence of metabolic diseases . a recent study showed that pcb  <dig> exacerbated obesity in mice when administered in combination with a high-fat-diet resulting in increased visceral adiposity, hepatic steatosis, plasma adipokines, as well as up-regulation and down-regulation of genes for hepatic lipid biosynthesis and degradation, respectively  <cit> . in mouse fibroblast 3t3-l <dig> cells, pcb  <dig> and other environmental chemicals have been shown to promote adipogenesis  <cit> . studies using zebrafish  suggest that fish can be useful models in exploring effects of environmental chemicals that may act as metabolic disruptors . to date, no studies have explored effects pcb  <dig> toxicity in fish liver using high throughput approaches, perhaps partly due to lack of sequenced and annotated genomes for many fish species. the atlantic cod is a commercially important species that is also commonly used in monitoring environmental pollution and laboratory toxicological investigations . the sequencing of its genome  <cit>  has recently enabled us to apply genomic approaches to study toxicant effects in this organism  <cit> . exposure to individual pcb congeners, such as pcb  <dig>  and subsequent analysis using global approaches like transcriptome assays should enable a better understanding of the toxic effects and the mechanisms involved. such mechanistic toxicogenomics studies are increasingly recognized as important components in developing models that can help in risk assessment of environmental contaminants . furthermore, high throughput transcriptomics approaches may facilitate identification of new biomarkers that can be applied in improved monitoring of pollution in the aquatic environment.

the aim of this study was to map the range of molecular targets of pcb  <dig> and gain better insights into its toxicity mechanisms in the liver of atlantic cod, using recently developed oligonucleotide arrays  <cit> . a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of atlantic cod liver was performed after exposure to pcb  <dig>  and various bioinformatics approaches were applied to explore the major genes and pathways affected, and the possible toxicity mechanisms involved.

RESULTS
differentially regulated genes
analysis of the microarray data resulted in  <dig> candidate genes differentially regulated in the highest dose  group, using sam  at fdr   10% . five genes found to be differentially regulated by qpcr  assay  were also included in additional file 1: table s <dig>  this list of  <dig> differentially regulated genes was used for pathway enrichment analysis in david  and metacore . although no differentially regulated genes were detected for the lower  <dig>  and 2 mg/kg bw pcb  <dig> doses , a dose–response trend is apparent in the expression of the differentially regulated genes as indicated by hierarchical clustering analysis . in the hierarchical clustering, the pcb  <dig> treated samples are well separated from the control samples, and the dose groups are co- clustered except one  sample that was grouped with the lowest dose group. in general high individual variability was observed in the microarray data, which combined with a limited number of samples , appear to have contributed to moderate levels of statistical significance for differential regulation. thus, gene set enrichment analysis , which is an independent approach for pathway enrichment analysis that uses the whole set of genes without pre-selection  <cit> , was also performed in addition to pathway analysis using david and metacore performed with the differentially regulated genes. in addition, selected genes in the affected pathways were assayed by qpcr on a larger sample size to confirm the microarray data .figure  <dig> 
hierarchical clustering analysis of genes differentially regulated by pcb  <dig>  analysis was performed based on log2-transformed ratio values of  <dig> genes differentially regulated, between the 8 m/kg bw pcb  <dig> dose and control groups. rows represent genes and columns represent samples. samples: cont, control;  <dig>  mg, 2 mg and 8 mg indicate,  <dig> ,  <dig> and 8 mg/kg bw pcb  <dig>  respectively. color bar indicates log2-transformed ratio values and corresponding colors .



qpcr assay
to confirm the microarray results in a larger number of samples , the mrna levels of  <dig> up-regulated genes selected based on their relevance in the most enriched lipid metabolism and cell cycle related pathways were analyzed by qpcr . half of these genes were selected from the differentially regulated list . another five genes  that were up-regulated by microarray but not at significant levels  were also included in the pcr assay. a dose–response trend was observed for all the genes and statistical analysis using one-way anova showed  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated in at least one dose group of pcb  <dig> treated fish as determined by qpcr assays , thus confirming and strengthening the microarray results.figure  <dig> 
selected genes up-regulated in pcb  <dig> treated fish in qpcr assay. each panel represents a graph of fold-changes in mrna levels for the indicated gene in lipid metabolism  and cell cycle  related pathways. qpcr was performed on a larger sample size  for all genes except fabp <dig>  for which, n =  <dig> for 2 mg/kg bw dose and n =  <dig> for each of the other groups. contr,  <dig>  mg, 2 mg and 8 mg indicate control,  <dig> ,  <dig> and 8 mg/kg bw pcb  <dig> doses, respectively. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  .data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.



validation of the microarray method by qpcr was also performed by direct comparison of fold-changes obtained by the two methods only in the subset of samples analyzed by microarrays . expression levels of  <dig> of the above genes and additional randomly selected  <dig> genes  from the differentially regulated list  were analyzed. for most of the genes, fold-changes in expression levels with the two methods showed good correlations . only two of the  <dig> genes  showed poor correlations with microarray data . confirming the microarray data,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated  in the highest dose group . thus, in general there is good concordance between the two methods.

functional enrichment analysis
pathway and gene ontology analysis in david
the  <dig> differentially regulated genes  were used in pathway analysis using david  <cit>  to see to most enriched pathways and biological processes. functional annotation in david showed that two of the top three significantly enriched clusters of pathways and gene ontology  biological processes  are related to lipid metabolism and dna replication/ cell cycle . the different significantly enriched go bp and pathways in each of these two major enriched pathways have overlapping list of constituent genes as illustrated by the venn diagrams for lipid metabolism  and dna metabolism related genes . for example, all or the majority of the genes in dna replication, dna repair and cell cycle pathways and processes are the subset of genes in the dna metabolism biological process . as expected, reactome dna replication genes are a subset of cell cycle genes, and all the genes in go bp cellular response to stress are a subset of the genes in cellular response to stimulus . the bp cellular response to stimulus shares many of the genes  with dna metabolism and cell cycle, suggesting that the stress response activated here is related to dna replication/ cell cycle . the last significantly enriched term  in the last cluster contains  <dig> genes  and is related to programmed cell death . in summary, the significantly enriched functional annotations suggest that pathways related to lipid metabolism and cell cycle were affected by pcb  <dig> in cod liver. the up-regulation of many dna replication and mitotic cell cycle genes suggests proliferative effect of pcb  <dig>  similarly, up-regulation of all the genes in the lipid metabolic process   suggests lipogenic effect of pcb  <dig> table  <dig>

functional ontology analysis using metacore
analysis of the differentially regulated genes using the functional ontologies in metacore  resulted in significant enrichment of many pathways and networks mainly related to lipid metabolism, cell cycle, tissue remodeling and wound repair, immune response, stress response, apoptosis and various signaling pathways . larger number of processes and pathways were significantly enriched using metacore, perhaps because of differences in annotations between the databases used. significantly enriched top  <dig> genego pathways, go processes and top  <dig> process networks are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. pathways and go processes associated with lipid metabolism and dna metabolism are among the top significantly enriched , which is consistent with the enrichment analysis using david . the map of the top scoring pathway related to lipid metabolism , scap/srebp transcriptional control of cholesterol and fa biosynthesis, is shown in figure  <dig>  all the genes indicated on this pathway including genes coding for the sterol regulatory element-binding protein  <dig>  and key genes of enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis  were up-regulated , suggesting increased synthesis of fatty acids. srebp <dig> plays key role is transcriptional activation of the lipogenic enzyme genes in the liver  <cit> .table  <dig>

the organ-specific toxicity ontologies in metacore combine normal and pathological processes with organ-specific gene markers . enrichment analysis of liver-specific toxicity ontologies was performed to explore effects on liver specific functions. again, the top enriched liver-specific toxic pathology biomarkers, toxicity processes, pathway maps, go processes, go molecular functions, go localizations and drug and xenobiotic metabolism enzymes highlight mainly lipid metabolism and cell proliferation related events . for example, the two top enriched toxic pathology biomarkers, liver-lipid accumulation, macrovesicular  and liver-degeneration  are pathologies that might be attributed to up-regulation of lipogenic genes . the most significant interaction network generated in metacore using the  <dig> genes in liver-lipid accumulation, macrovesicular is shown in . this network shows potential involvement of the genes in development of pathology related to lipid accumulation. similarly, the top liver-specific toxicity processes, steatosis, development  and cell cycle, processes involved in s-phase   are related to lipid accumulation and cell proliferation, respectively. the list of liver-specific enriched maps and go processes  are similar to the list in additional file 2: table s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. go molecular functions and localizations also reflect the top enriched lipid metabolism and cell cycle pathways . the analysis also showed enrichment of pathways mediated by ahr and the nuclear receptors  associated with drug and xenobiotic metabolism enzymes . in mammals, the nuclear receptors lxr, car and pxr are involved in regulation of lipid metabolism, mainly through cross-talk with srbp <dig> pathway   <cit> . enrichment of pxr/ car mediated pathway is expected as pcb  <dig> is known to activate these receptors  <cit> . surprisingly, ahr mediated regulation of drug and xenobiotic metabolism enzymes is the top enriched pathway with  <dig> genes involved , although pcb  <dig> does not activate ahr. the  <dig> genes in this pathway are ccl <dig>  cntnap <dig>  fos, hmgcr, itpkb, mapk <dig>  myo1d, pcna, pola <dig>  psma <dig>  srebf <dig> and tead <dig>  the ahr signaling pathway may however interact with these genes indirectly and the enrichment here may reflect its diverse biological functions and possible alternative mechanisms involved.

interactome and network analysis using metacore
the metacore interactome analysis tool was used to explore statistically significant interactions of the differentially regulated genes . the analysis option “transcription factors” was used to perform enrichment analysis of interactions based on transcriptional regulation mechanisms, which generated a list of significantly enriched  transcription factors . here, enrichment shows that a significantly higher proportion of genes in the up-loaded list  show interactions with the transcription factor. many transcription factors involved in regulation of the cell cycle  and lipid metabolism  were significantly enriched , consistent with the top enrichment of these two pathways. interestingly, the top enriched transcription factor n <dig>  is a regulator of adipocyte differentiation and the lipogenic transcription factors pparg and srebp <dig> <cit> . among the transcription factors enriched, early growth response  <dig>  and sterol regulatory element-binding protein  <dig>  were also up-regulated in this study .

to build a network of interaction among the differentially regulated genes in our experiment, the network building tool in metacore with the “direct interaction” algorithm was used, which resulted in a statistically significant  network . remarkably, this network reveals regulatory relationships between the transcription factors and their target genes in the differentially regulated list, highlighting activation of the two main pathways lipid metabolism and cell cycle. particularly well illustrated is the interactions of egr <dig>  pparg and srbp <dig> transcription factors that result in activation of the lipogenic genes hmdh, fatty acid binding protein, acaca, acly, scd <dig> and acsa, which is supported by the top enriched canonical pathway . the network suggests activation of the transcription factors through the mapk  pathway and potential cross-talk between the cell proliferation and lipogenic pathways. the gene coding for the transcription factor egr <dig> is one of the most up-regulated in this experiment , which may suggest its importance in the regulation of the differentially regulated genes. as indicated egr <dig> appears to occupy a central role in the network as it is possibly activated via the p <dig> mapk signaling pathway, and interacts downstream with both proliferation and lipogenic transcription factors . egr <dig>  known to regulate many genes related to cell proliferation, apoptosis and immune response  <cit> , has also been implicated in regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes  <cit> , supporting the interactions depicted in the network shown here.figure  <dig>

gene set enrichment analysis 
gsea uses the whole set of genes without pre-selection to determine if a pre-defined set of genes constituting a functional category show significant, concordant differences in expression between two biological states  <cit> . gsea was performed here as an independent and complementary method to the pathway analyses using david and metacore, which were performed only on the differentially regulated genes. gsea is suited for modest changes in gene expression since it draws its statistical power from concordant differential expression of many genes within a gene set and their correlation to one of the two biological states under comparison  <cit> . in this analysis, all cod genes on the array that could be mapped to putative human orthologs were ranked based on relative expression correlation from highest absolute levels in the pcb  <dig> groups to the lowest levels. the predominant gene sets significantly enriched are the reactome gene sets related to dna metabolism and cell cycle . table  <dig> shows the significantly enriched gene sets of the reactome , genmapp  and kegg  databases. gene sets related to lipid metabolism, triglyceride biosynthesis and glycerophospholipid metabolism were among the significantly enriched . many more reactome gene sets  were significantly enriched , compared to only  <dig> and  <dig> for genmapp and kegg, respectively . most of the reactome gene sets are associated with dna repair, replication and cell cycle . other top enriched reactome gene sets are mainly related to immune response, apoptosis, respiratory electron transport, translation and circadian clock. the top significantly enriched gene sets  are largely similar to the enriched pathways using david and metacore , which mainly highlighted pathways associated with dna metabolism, cell cycle, lipid metabolism, apoptosis, immune response and, stress response. in figure  <dig>  enrichment plots for top enriched reactome pathways, synthesis of dna  with the corresponding leading edge genes , and triglyceride biosynthesis , with the corresponding leading edge genes  are shown. genes in the enriched gene sets have higher enrichment scores  and tend to have hits clustered towards the top of the sorted gene list , suggesting their modulation by pcb  <dig>  the leading edge list in the top gene set synthesis of dna  contains most of the genes in the reactome pathways dna replication and cell cycle enriched in pathway analysis using david . similarly, the leading edge list in the gene set triglyceride biosynthesis  consists of genes coding for enzymes in de novo synthesis of glycerolipids such as acly, acaca, fasn, gpat, agpat <dig>  agpat <dig>  and agpat <dig>  some of which are also present in the enriched lipid synthesis biological processes in david . the up-regulation of these genes may indicate increased lipid synthesis in pcb  <dig> treated fish liver, in agreement with the results from analysis using david and metacore.table  <dig>

in summary, pathways, processes and networks related to dna replication, cell cycle and lipid metabolism were consistently enriched using the different methods of analysis employed. the coordinated up-regulation of dna replication and cell cycle related genes suggests that pcb  <dig> increases cell proliferation in the liver of cod. in agreement with our results, pcb  <dig> has been shown to increase hepatocyte proliferation and act as liver tumor promoter in rats  <cit> . some of the up-regulated genes coding for enzymes such as acly, acaca and fasn  are important in de novo lipid biosynthesis pathway  <cit> , suggesting increased lipogenesis in pcb  <dig> treated fish. for example, acaca catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids  <cit> .

transcriptional activation of both cell cycle and lipogenic genes has been observed during adipogenesis in mammalian model systems  <cit> . it is not clear if the simultaneous up-regulation of cell cycle and lipogenic genes in cod liver is mechanistically related to these adipogenesis processes in mammalian systems. it is possible that up-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression is related to activation of immune response pathways observed here or liver tumor promoting effects of pcb  <dig>  as shown in rats  <cit> . however, the transcriptional activation of lipogenic genes in cod liver treated by pcb  <dig> appears to be supported by recent studies that have documented adipogenic effects of pcbs and other environmental chemicals  <cit> . in mice, it was reported that bisphenol a increased hepatic expression of lipogenic genes and lipid accumulation  <cit> . in pre-adipogenic fibroblast 3t3-l <dig> cell culture studies, pcb  <dig> and other chemicals have also been shown to increase transcription of lipogenic marker genes, lipid accumulation and adipogenic differentiation  <cit> . a recent study showed that mice fed with a combination of pcb  <dig> and high-fat-diet showed increased visceral adiposity, hepatic steatosis, plasma adipokines, and up-regulation of hepatic lipid biosynthesis and down- regulation of β-oxidation genes  <cit> . in our experiment, significant changes were not observed in expression of β-oxidation genes, although mrna levels of the key gene of this pathway, liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a  showed a non-significant  decrease . phospholipase b <dig>  among the down-regulated genes  may also be related to lipid degradation. our hypothesis that transcriptional activation of lipid biosynthesis genes could be attributed to lipogenic effect of pcb  <dig> is supported by these studies. although species differences should be considered in the comparison with mammalian systems, our results appear to be consistent with conservation of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis processes in fish and mammals  <cit> . indeed, zebrafish  is increasingly used as a model organism in research on obesity and related metabolic diseases . thus, our results showing increased transcription of lipogenic genes in the liver of cod treated with pcb  <dig> can provide relevant insights into potential effects in mammals.

apart from cell cycle and lipid metabolism pathways, other significantly enriched pathways are mainly associated with immune response, apoptosis, stress response and tissue remodeling, and they are probably related to general toxicity by pcb  <dig>  some of the genes in these pathways  have also significant overlap with the genes in lipid metabolism and cell cycle pathways . apoptosis and immune response pathways have been previously reported to be affected in transcriptomics and proteomics studies in response to environmental contaminants in cod and other fish . studies in higher organisms have also shown that pcb  <dig> can modulate the immune system  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression analysis in the liver of cod treated with pcb  <dig> indicated transcriptional activation of genes mainly associated with cell cycle, dna replication, lipid metabolism, immune response, apoptosis and stress response pathways. the constituent genes in the two major affected pathways, cell cycle and lipid biosynthesis were mostly up-regulated, suggesting increased cell proliferation and lipid synthesis in pcb  <dig> treated cod liver. the results provide new insights into mechanisms of toxicity of pcb  <dig>
