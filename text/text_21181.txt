BACKGROUND
the pancreas has two major functions fulfilled by distinct tissues: i) production of digestive enzymes by the exocrine cells and ii) release of various hormones by distinct endocrine cell types . these mature pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells derive from a pool of endodermal progenitor cells located in the embryonic gut. differentiation of these cells is controlled by a regulatory cascade involving a battery of pancreatic transcription factors . the hox-like homeoprotein pdx <dig> is expressed in pancreatic progenitor cells and plays a crucial role in pancreas development. its absence results in an early arrest of pancreatic bud growth and blocks both exocrine and endocrine cell differentiation  <cit> . pdx <dig> regulates the expression of downstream target genes by acting in concert with regulatory proteins, including other homeodomain proteins such as pbx and meis/prep  <cit> . subsequent commitment of pdx1+ pancreatic progenitors to the endocrine lineage is controlled by a set of other transcription factors such as ngn <dig>  neurod, isl <dig> and insm1/ia <dig>  <cit> . specification of the various endocrine cell subtypes involves the action of downstream regulators such as the homeodomain-containing proteins pax <dig>  pax <dig>  arx, nkx <dig>  and nkx <dig>   <cit> . in mouse, pax <dig> is expressed in all pancreatic endocrine cells and its disruption leads to a reduction of α, β and δ cells and an increase of ε cells  <cit> . pax <dig> plays crucial functions in the development of several organs/tissues besides the endocrine pancreas, such as the eyes, olfactory system, brain, spinal cord, enteroendocrine cells and the pituitary .

expression of the pax <dig> gene is controlled by a highly complex system of regulatory elements comprising at least three distinct promoters  and many cis-acting elements or enhancers, located along the gene  <cit> . long-range control elements have been identified in the human pax <dig> locus located more than  <dig> kb downstream from the transcription unit  <cit> . sequence comparisons of different vertebrate pax <dig> genes have revealed that most of these cis-acting elements are evolutionarily conserved. reports published so far indicate that expression in a specific tissue can be driven by several distinct enhancers. experiments focusing on the zebrafish, quail, mouse, and human pax <dig> genes have highlighted several distinct enhancers targeting expression to the neuroretina. in vitro experiments with the quail pax <dig> gene have revealed a region located  <dig>  kb downstream from the quail p <dig> promoter, acting as an enhancer in neural retina cells  <cit> . several in vivo transgenic studies have led to identification of at least five other retinal enhancers, located respectively at  <dig> kb upstream from the murine p <dig> promoter  <cit> , just upstream from the promoter pα  <cit> , within intron  <dig>  <cit> , and even  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb downstream from the pax <dig> gene  <cit> .

two enhancers have been identified as participating in the control of pax <dig> expression in the lens. the first, driving expression in the lens placode and corneal ectoderm, lies about  <dig>  kb upstream from the p <dig> murine promoter  <cit>  and is recognized by a multi-protein complex composed of the homeoproteins meis <dig> and meis <dig>  <cit> . this enhancer is also bound by a complex containing the sry-like hmg box sox <dig> transcription factor and the oct- <dig> factor, which are essential for pax <dig> expression in the lens placode and its derivatives  <cit> . the second lens enhancer consists of the ei/simo elements located  <dig> kb downstream the last pax <dig> exon  <cit> .

regulatory regions involved in pancreatic expression have also been identified within the pax <dig> locus. two different groups have shown that in the mouse, the pancreatic regulatory elements are located upstream from the p <dig> promoter  <cit> . these groups disagree, however, as to the precise location of these elements: kammandel and coworkers observed disrupted pancreatic expression of the lacz reporter gene after deletion of sequences located  <dig> kb upstream from exon  <dig>  indicating the presence of an essential pancreatic element in this region  <cit> . in contrast, zhang and co-workers found the first  <dig>  kb of the pax <dig> p <dig> promoter to be sufficient for expression in the pancreas and observed that a further  <dig> bp 5' deletion of the promoter entirely abolished reporter expression  <cit> . the reason for this discrepancy is still unknown.

in zebrafish, partial duplication of the genome during teleost evolution has led to two pax <dig> paralogs named pax6a and pax6b  <cit> . both genes are expressed in overlapping areas during development. they are activated in the anterior neural plate at the end of gastrulation; however, their expression pattern diverges slightly at later stages  <cit> . although the embryonic expression patterns of the two zebrafish pax <dig> genes have been well-characterized in ocular structures and the cns, few data are available on their pancreatic expression. we have previously reported expression of pax6b in the pancreas at early stages   <cit> , but whether pax6a gene is activated in the pancreas at later developmental stages is still unclear.

in the present study, we have compared in detail the expression of both zebrafish homologs. we show that only pax6b is expressed in the pancreas during embryogenesis and we highlight cis- and trans-regulatory elements responsible for this differential pancreatic expression.

RESULTS
zebrafish pax6b is expressed in endocrine pancreatic cells in contrast to the zebrafish pax6a gene
we first compared, by whole mount in situ hybridization , the temporal and the spatial expression patterns of the pax6a and pax6b genes between the 10-somite stage and  <dig> days of zebrafish development . at 10-somite stage, we found both genes to be expressed in the eye field, the presumptive diencephalon and hindbrain and the spinal cord   <cit> . by  <dig> onward, clear differences in expression were noted between the two genes at the level of the hindbrain and pancreas, pax6a being expressed more strongly than pax6b in the hindbrain while only pax6b was detected in the pancreatic anlagen at all stages examined . to further characterize the expression of pax6a and pax6b, double-fluorescent wish was carried out. at  <dig> hpf, pax6b colocalizes with neurod expressed in all pancreatic endocrine cells . as mentioned above, pax6a was never detected in the pancreas as revealled by the absence of colocalization with the pancreatic marker pdx <dig> . at the pancreatic level, the results clearly show that pax6b is expressed in the α, β, δ and ε endocrine cell types .

sequence comparison of vertebrate pax <dig> genes reveals three conserved regions upstream from the p <dig> promoter
to identify the cis-regulatory elements responsible for pax6b expression in the pancreas, we first aligned the sequences of the two zebrafish pax <dig> genes with the mouse pax <dig> gene. both zebrafish pax <dig> genes have a structure similar to that reported for the mouse and human pax <dig> genes   <cit> . a comparison of the zebrafish genomic sequence with cdna and est sequences revealed the presence of at least  <dig> exons. the location of the 5' ends of the pax6b transcripts confirms the presence of three promoters, p <dig>  p <dig> and pα as described for the mouse and human genes. a comparison of the zebrafish pax6a and pax6b genes with the mouse pax <dig> gene revealed that most exons are conserved . conserved regions were also found in non transcribed sequences , most of which are located within previously described regulatory regions. interestingly, some of these regulatory sequences are more conserved in one of the two zebrafish pax <dig> genes and thus might be responsible for the slightly different expression patterns. for example, one conserved element in the p <dig> promoter and one element in intron  <dig> are well conserved in pax6a but not in pax6b. conversely, one element upstream from the p <dig> promoter is well conserved in the pax6b but not in pax6a .

to identify the sequence motifs of the p <dig> promoter conserved among all known vertebrate pax <dig> genes, we performed multiple alignments of the sequences encompassing conserved regions a, b, c . in the figure, the nucleotide positions that are identical in all species are shown in yellow, while those conserved in all vertebrate pax <dig> genes except zebrafish pax6a are highlighted by red stars. these alignments clearly show that region a is less conserved than regions b and c in the zebrafish pax6a gene, especially at the level of one particular motif, named pa <dig>  region a actually corresponds to the pancreatic element reported for the mouse pax <dig> gene by kammandel and coworkers  <cit> . region b overlaps with the lens placode enhancer  <cit>  and region c maps to the pancreatic element reported by the group of maas  <cit> . as expression in the pancreas is observed for all vertebrate pax <dig> genes except zebrafish pax6a, sequence divergence within region a might be the cause of this differential expression. this would be in agreement with kammandel's results locating a pancreatic regulatory element in region a.

the upstream regulatory region of the zebrafish p <dig> pax6b promoter targets expression to the endocrine pancreas
to determine whether the p <dig> promoter of pax6b can target expression to the pancreas, we fused  <dig>  kb of the pax6b p <dig> promoter, including the conserved regions a, b and c, upstream from the gfp or dsred coding region. these two reporter constructs were injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs and the resulting embryos were analysed for gfp/dsred expression  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after injection. transgene expression was detected in cells of the retina, brain and pancreas . to establish stable transgenic lines, injected embryos displaying high gfp or dsred expression were raised to adulthood and then tested for germline transmission of the pax6b transgene. we identified one pax6b:gfp founder and five pax6b:dsred founders. embryos generated from all these founders displayed very similar expression patterns. the only differences observed between lines concerned the level of transgene expression. expression of the pax6b transgenes is first detected in the pancreatic anlagen around 14-somite stage, and is clearly visible by  <dig> hpf in all transgenic lines . between  <dig> and  <dig> hours post fertilization, gfp/dsred also appears in the ventral telencephalon, the optic stalks and the dorsal diencephalon .

about  <dig> hpf, first signs of gfp/dsred expression also appear in a small cluster of cells in the ventronasal part of retina, near the optic stalks and the optic choroid . this expression gradually expands and spreads to the entire retina, from the ventral to the nasal retina first and subsequently to the temporal and dorsal regions . this expression pattern is reminiscent of the wave of neurogenesis occurring in the retina  <cit>  and coincides spatiotemporally with the differentiation wave of retinal ganglion cells . on day  <dig> of development, transgene expression is also detected in the axons of the rgc within the optic nerves, revealing the optic chiasma . in  <dig> dpf embryos, gfp/dsred expression is detected in several layers of the neuroretina corresponding mainly to the inner plexiform layer, subset of cells in the inner nuclear layer , the outer plexiform layer and to the outer nuclear layer . from  <dig>  dpf onwards, pax6b transgenes are also detected in scattered cells of the gut corresponding to the enteroendocrine cells and in some neurons of the mesencephalon . expression of the transgenes gradually disappears in pancreas by  <dig> dpf, and in the enteroendocrine cells by about  <dig> dpf, while being maintained in the other tissues, including neurons of the brain and some layers of the retina .

pancreatic expression of pax6b relies on the two highly conserved regions a and c
to pinpoint regulatory regions essential to expression in these various tissues, we generated deletions of the conserved regions a, b and c and tested the corresponding constructs in both transient and stable transgenic zebrafish . for the transient expression approach, we used two different transgenesis methods: the sce-i meganuclease method  <cit>  and transposon tol2-mediated transgenesis  <cit> . the embryos were analysed  <dig> and  <dig> hours after transgene injection, and the percentage of injected embryos displaying gfp/dsred expression in the retina, telencephalon, and pancreas was determined . with the sce-i method, about half of the embryos injected with the full length construct showed dsred expression, 66% of which displayed it in the retina, 32% in the pancreas and 85% in the telencephalon. the observed transient and mosaic expression is in agreement with the expression detected in the stable lines. deletion of enhancer a led to a decrease of the percentage of embryos expressing dsred in the endocrine pancreas, from  <dig> to 18%, and to reduction of the number of dsred expressing cells in this tissue . when region b was deleted, the proportion of embryos expressing the reporter protein in the retina and telencephalon was significantly reduced, while expression in the pancreas remained unchanged . deletion of region c led to a strong decrease in dsred positive embryos, and the percentage of embryos expressing dsred in the pancreatic tissue was reduced from  <dig> to 5%.

when the tol2-transposon method was used, the efficiency of the transgenesis was drastically increased, and about 95% of the embryos injected with the full length p <dig> construct transiently expressed gfp in the retina; 79% expressed it in the pancreas, and 91% expressed it in the telencephalon , showing that tol2-mediated transient expression reproduces fairly well the expression pattern detected in the stable transgenic line. deletion of element a led to a decrease in the number of embryos expressing gfp in the pancreatic islet , suggesting that this element is necessary for high pancreatic expression. when we removed enhancer c, the overall transgene expression was greatly diminished and expression in the pancreas was also reduced to only 28% of injected embryos .

for each deletion construct used for sce-i transgenesis, the injected embryos were raised to adulthood and tested for germline transmission . one transgenic line was obtained for the a-box deletion construct. while dsred expression was still clearly observed at the level of the retina and enteroendocrine cells in this transgenic line, much weaker expression was observed in the pancreas as compared to the transgenic lines harboring the full-length p <dig> promoter construct . two stable transgenic lines were obtained with the b-box deletion construct. these two lines displayed very strong dsred expression in the pancreas but no detectable expression in the retina, the enteroendocrine cells or the telencephalon . finally, three stable lines harboring the c-box deletion construct were identified by pcr but none of them displayed detectable dsred expression .

taken together, these transient and stable expression data indicate that region a is required for expression in the telencephalon and for maintaining a high expression level in the pancreas, while element b is crucial to retinal expression. enhancer c is crucial to the overall activity of the p <dig> promoter, since transgene expression was prevented in stable transgenic lines or strongly reduced in transient expression assays, when this region was missing. moreover, the results of the sce-i transient expression assays suggest that region c may play a role in pancreatic expression.

to further determine the roles of these regions, we examined whether they are sufficient for driving pancreatic expression. for this we produced constructs containing regions a, b and c of the zebrafish pax <dig> genes cloned in front of a minimal cfos promoter fused to the gfp sequence  and flanked by tol <dig> inverted repeats . these constructs were injected in zebrafish eggs with tol <dig> transposase and the embryos were tested for gfp expression at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . we found that the region abc of pax6b can drive gfp expression in the pancreas but that the homologous region of pax6a cannot . this demonstrates that the differential pancreatic expression of the two zebrafish pax <dig> genes is due to sequence differences within the conserved abc regions. it also should be noted that mosaic expression of pax6b-abc-cfos transgene was detected within the retina . in experiments where either the c region or the ab regions were inserted alone in front of the heterologous cfos promoter, we observed that the c region of pax6b was sufficient to drive some gfp expression in the pancreas, whereas that of pax6a was not . yet the level of pancreatic expression observed was much lower with pax6b region c alone than with the pax6b abc construct. no pancreatic expression was observed with the construct carrying regions a and b of either pax6a or pax6b . altogether, these data indicate that high pancreatic expression relies on the combined action of regions a and c.

the pa <dig> and pa <dig> elements of pax6b are recognized respectively by a cellular complex containing the pdx1-pbx-prep trimer or the pbx-prep dimer
as regions a and c are involved in pancreatic expression, we looked for pancreatic transcription factors binding to these regulatory regions. a detailed sequence comparison of the a regions of different vertebrate pax <dig> genes revealed two highly conserved motifs, named pa <dig> and pa <dig> . the pa <dig> motif, which is divergent only in the zebrafish pax6a gene, contains the motif atcaatca, exactly matching the consensus binding site of pbx factors  <cit> . the pa <dig> motif, present in the zebrafish pax6a gene but with a mismatch at the 3' end and one at the 5' ends, also contains a related-pbx consensus binding site tcaatc. pbx factors are homeoproteins belonging to the pbc tale class, that have been shown to form heterodimeric complexes with homeproteins of the hm-tale class, the meis and prep factors  <cit> . these dimeric pbx-meis/prep complexes bind specific motifs within enhancers or promoters and can cooperate with hox-type homeoproteins bound to neighboring elements  <cit> . for example, we have previously shown that in pancreatic cells, the ue-a element of the somatostatin promoter is recognized by a dimeric pbx-prep complex cooperating with the pancreatic factor pdx <dig>  a hox-type homeoprotein, bound to the adjacent tse <dig> element  <cit> . this prompted us to investigate whether the pa <dig> and pa <dig> motifs of pax6b  might be recognized by pbx-meis/prep complexes. emsas were performed on the pa1b and pa2b elements with nuclear extracts from pancreatic endocrine cell lines  . incubation of pancreatic nuclear cell extract with pa1b led to the formation of two strong closely migrating complexes named s and l, and two fainter, more slowly migrating bands named t and t'. all the complexes were easily displaced by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled pa1b, demonstrating the high affinity of the nuclear factors for this element . addition of unlabeled somatostatin element ue-a, which binds to the pbx-prep complex, also displaced the binding on the probe, but the ue-a element mutated in the pbx consensus motif was unable to compete . this indicates that the same proteins in the pancreatic extract recognize both cis-elements pa1b and ue-a. we also noticed a specific increase in the intensity of complexes t and t' when the amount of pancreatic tu <dig> cell extract was raised . to determine whether the pbx and prep <dig> factors actually bind to these elements, supershift assays were performed with antibodies raised against the pbx and prep <dig> homeoproteins. when the pancreatic extracts were incubated with an antibody reacting specifically with the long pbx isoforms  but not with the short isoforms , the formation of the slower migrating complex l and the higher t'complex were specifically blocked . likewise, when pancreatic extracts were incubated with prep <dig> antibody, the four complexes s, l, t and t'were disrupted . these results indicate that complexes s, l, t and t' contain pbx and prep homeoproteins. furthermore, complexes s and l were observed with nuclear extract from all tested non-pancreatic cell lines , but the t and t' complexes were observed only with extracts from pancreatic cells  . as tale homeoproteins are cofactors for hox-type homeoproteins and as pdx <dig> is a major pancreatic homeoprotein, we tested whether the pdx <dig> protein might be present in t and/or t'complexes. addition of an anti-pdx <dig> antiserum to the pancreatic extract supershifted both t and t'complexes, whereas complexes s and l were not affected . we next attempted to reconstitute the protein-dna complexes observed, using in vitro-translated pdx <dig>  pbx1a and prep <dig> factors. no protein-dna complex was observed with pbx1a and prep <dig> proteins were tested separately . however, when pbx1a  and prep <dig> were added simultaneously, a protein-dna complex was generated at the same level as the l complex . the t'-like complex could also be generated by incubating the pa1b probe with recombinant pdx <dig>  pbx1a and prep <dig> . it is noteworthy that pdx <dig> alone was unable to bind the pa1b element in the absence of pbx and prep <dig> factors . when the corresponding sequence of pax6a was tested by emsa, no binding of pdx <dig>  pbx or prep proteins was detected, as demonstrated by the lack of competition with pa1b or ue-a element ; conversely, the binding of pdx <dig>  pbx and prep factors on the pa1b probe was not displaced by adding an excess of unlabelled pa1a . thus, all these results show that the conserved pa <dig> element of the pax6b promoter  binds a pancreatic trimeric proteins complex comprising the ubiquitous factors pbx, prep <dig> and the pancreatic factor pdx <dig> 

when emsas were performed with the pa2b probe , we also observed formation of complexes s and l due to binding of the pbx-prep dimer . indeed, both the s and l complexes were specifically displaced by unlabelled pa2b, pa1b or ue-a elements  and blocked by the addition of prep <dig> antibody . furthermore, the l complex was prevented by the antibody recognizing the long forms of pbx proteins . in these experiments, we never detected any slower migrating t or t'complex, and the s and l complexes were observed with extracts from both pancreatic and non-pancreatic cell lines, in agreement with the ubiquitous expression of prep <dig> and of pbx proteins.

pdx <dig> and pbx-prep heterodimer bind two cis-elements within the c region of the zebrafish pax6b gene
as region c of the zebrafish pax6b gene was able to drive some expression in the pancreas, we looked for transcription factors binding to this element. a sequence comparison of the c regions of various vertebrate pax <dig> genes, including both zebrafish pax <dig> genes , revealed several motifs well-conserved through evolution. surprisingly, region c of pax6a, displaying no pancreatic activity , differs by only  <dig> nucleotides from the consensus sequence of the other vertebrate pax <dig> genes . it is noteworthy that the pc <dig> element, reported to be required for pancreatic expression and to bind a pbx-prep dimmer  <cit> , is found in both pax6a and pax6b and thus cannot explain the differential activity of these genes. in accordance to the reports of zhang and collaborators, we also observed binding of pbx-prep dimer on the zebrafish pc <dig> element of the pax6b gene . interestingly, one of the two positions, where the pax6a gene diverges from the pax6b gene, is located in a conserved motif, named pc <dig>  this element contains a well-conserved taat motif present in all vertebrate pax <dig> genes except chicken pax <dig> and the zebrafish pax6a . this motif is highly similar to the pdx1-binding p element of the insulin promoter  <cit> . when we tested the pc <dig> element of the zebrafish pax6b in emsa  with pancreatic cell extract, we observed formation of one major specific complex  which is perturbated by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled pc3b, demonstrating the high affinity of the nuclear factor for this element . no significant competition was observed with unlabeled ue-a or ue-amut  and no supershift was observed by the pbx and prep <dig> antibodies . on the other hand, incubation of the extract with anti-pdx <dig> antibody caused the disappearance of the complex , and addition of the recombinant pdx <dig> protein to the pc3b probe was sufficient to reconstitute a complex showing the same mobility . this demonstrates that the pancreatic homeobox pdx <dig> factor binds as a monomer to the conserved pc3b element. importantly, when the corresponding pc <dig> element of pax6a  was tested by emsa, no binding of pdx <dig> could be detected .

synergistic activation of the p0-pax6b promoter by pbx, prep <dig> and pdx1
as several conserved elements of the pax6b p <dig> promoter are bound by pdx <dig> and/or the pbx-prep complex, we next investigated how these proteins affect the activity of the p <dig> promoter. to this end, we generated a reporter plasmid carrying the pax6b p <dig> promoter inserted upstream from a gfp/luciferase gene. we then tested the activity of this construct by transient cell transfection in the presence of expression vectors for pbx1a, prep <dig> and pdx <dig>  the activity of the p0-pax6b promoter is very low in non pancreatic cells, such as the intestinal carcinoma cell line hct <dig> . while co-transfection of both pbx1a and prep <dig> expression vectors had no profound effect, co-transfection of the pdx1-expressing vector alone was sufficient to enhance the pax6b p <dig> promoter activity significantly, and this activity was increased still further in the presence of pbx1a and prep <dig> to reach a global activation of about 100-fold.

discussion
pax <dig> is an essential transcription factor that plays a role in several developmental processes, such as endocrine pancreatic cell differentiation and eye morphogenesis. identification of cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors driving pax <dig> expression will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the development of these tissues. here we have analyzed expression of the two zebrafish paralogs pax6a and pax6b, showing that only pax6b is expressed in the pancreas. our results of genomic sequence comparisons, transient and stable transgenesis assays in zebrafish, and in vitro studies, show that this differential expression is due to the regulatory regions a and c, located upstream from the p <dig> promoter. these regulatory regions contain two key pancreatic elements, pa <dig> and pc <dig>  present in the pax6b gene and not  in the pax6a gene. we show that the pa <dig> element is specifically bound by a heterotrimeric complex composed of the homeoproteins pdx <dig>  pbx and prep, whereas the pc <dig> element is recognized by pdx <dig> alone.

pancreatic expression of the zebrafish pax6b gene relies on the combined action of the conserved regions a and c
two different groups have previously shown by mouse transgenesis that the regulatory elements targeting expression of pax <dig> to pancreatic endocrine cells are located upstream from the p <dig> promoter  <cit> . yet on the basis of results obtained with 5' deletions within this promoter, they disagree as to the precise location of these pancreatic elements: whereas kammandel et al. highlight an essential element at  <dig>  kb upstream from exon  <dig>  <cit> , the group of maas locates the element  <dig>  kb upstream from this same exon  <dig>  <cit> . to resolve this ambiguity, we have carried out detailed comparisons of genomic sequences upstream from the p <dig> promoter among various vertebrates. we show that three regions  are conserved from teleosts to mammals. region a, corresponding to the pancreatic element identified by kammandel and co-workers, contains two motifs  that are strictly conserved in all vertebrate pax <dig> genes examined, except in the zebrafish pax6a gene, where the pa <dig> motif is missing. in contrast, both region b and region c are well conserved in the two zebrafish pax <dig> genes, region b overlapping with the lens-specific enhancer  <cit>  and region c corresponding with the pancreatic element identified by xu  <cit> .

the results of our study indicate that the pancreatic expression actually relies on the combined action of the two regulatory regions a and c, identified in the two previous studies. this is supported by at least three observations: i) deletion of region a significantly decreases pancreatic expression but does not abolish it completely; ii) region c is sufficient to drive weaker but detectable pancreatic expression, but deletion of that region, in the context of pax6b p <dig> promoter, does not abolish pancreatic expression in transient assays; iii) the pax6b p <dig> promoter, deleted of region b and retaining regions a and c, is strongly active in the pancreas in both mosaic  and stable transgenic embryos. our results clearly show that region c is also important for the overall activity of the pax6b p <dig> promoter, since deletion of region c completely abolishes p <dig> promoter activity in all tissues in the three distinct stable transgenic lines obtained, and since it causes a major reduction of the total number of dsred/gfp-expressing cells in transient transgenic embryos. the stronger effect of region c in stable transgenics may be due to stronger epigenetic regulation processes  . indeed, the expression being analysed  <dig> days, in case of transient transgenics, or more than  <dig> days in case of stable transgenics , after injection of the transgenes, we can assume that the epigenetic processes controlling transgene expression are more stringent in the stable transgenic lines. very recently, another study reported the differential expression of the two zebrafish pax <dig> genes and analysed the cause of this differential expression  <cit> . while they used a similar strategy based on the transient expression of pax6bp0:gfp constructs in mosaic transgenic embryos, these authors pointed up the importance of the conserved region  for the pancreatic expression, but not of region c. the reason of this discrepancy is unclear but could be due to the different designs of promoter deletions and swappings, and/or to a different level of assay sensitivity. in the present study, we analyse in more details the sequence motifs divergent in the two zebrafish promoters and we succeed to identify the transcription factors binding to these motifs.

binding of the pdx <dig>  pbx and prep proteins to cis-elements within regions a and c
we show here that the two most conserved elements of region a, pa <dig> and pa <dig>  are bound by the tale class homeoproteins pbx and prep. furthermore, the pa <dig> motif is recognized by a trimeric complex composed of pbx, prep and the pancreatic factor pdx <dig>  these three transcription factors cooperate to stimulate the activity of pax6b p <dig> promoter in transfected cells . the pa <dig> motif is not conserved in the pax6a gene, and the pancreatic trimeric complex is unable to bind to region a of pax6a. it is noteworthy that pdx <dig> does not bind the pa1b element at all when tested alone. it absolutely requires the cooperative binding of the dimeric complex pbx-prep. in contrast, although the ue-a element of the somatostatin gene contains the same motif, atcaatca, this ue-a site is recognized by a pbx-prep heterodimer but not a pdx1-pbx-prep heterotrimer  <cit> . this reveals the importance of the sequences flanking pa1b in formation of the trimeric complex.

zhang and coworkers have reported the binding of a pbx-prep dimer on another conserved sequence of the pax <dig> p <dig> promoter, located in region c  <cit> . they found mutation of that particular element to strongly affect the activity of the p <dig> promoter. in agreement with their results, we also detected binding of a pbx-prep dimer to the homologous zebrafish sequence. yet this element, here referred to as pc <dig>  is also present in the zebrafish pax6a gene, which is not expressed in the pancreas. furthermore, it is bound by a ubiquitous pbx-prep complex and not by a pancreas-specific complex. thus, the pancreatic regulatory activity of region c cannot be attributed to the pc <dig> site per se. on the other hand, we demonstrate binding of the pancreatic factor pdx <dig> to the pc <dig> element of the pax6b gene, while the corresponding sequence in the paralogous zebrafish pax6a gene is mutated and cannot bind to pdx <dig>  this provides a good explanation of the differential activity of the c regions between the two zebrafish pax <dig> genes. the function of pc <dig> site could be further tested by introducing point mutations in the pc3b site within the pax6b-c-fos:gfp fusion construct. the pc <dig> element is well conserved through evolution and was found in all analysed vertebrate pax <dig> genes  except in the zebrafish pax6a gene and in the chicken pax <dig> gene . the absence of the pc <dig> element in the chicken pax <dig> gene is quite surprising, as pax <dig> is expressed in pancreas in chick embryos  <cit> . it is nevertheless possible that another pc3-like element, elsewhere in the chicken p <dig> promoter, compensates for the absence of region c and acts cooperatively with the elements of region a.

regulatory elements of zebrafish pax6b driving expression in the retina, in enteroendocrine cells, and in the telencephalon
while the zebrafish pax6b p <dig> promoter drives reporter expression in pancreatic endocrine cells in agreement with data reported on the mouse pax <dig> p <dig> promoter, striking differences are found as regards expression in the other tissues. firstly, we never detected any gfp/dsred expression in the lens tissue of the six stable zebrafish transgenic lines, whereas all studies on the mouse p <dig> promoter have demonstrated a lens-specific enhancer located  <dig>  kb upstream from the mouse p <dig> promoter   <cit> . our study indicates that the region b of zebrafish pax6b is required for expression, not in the lens, but in the retina of zebrafish embryos. our data are in agreement with results obtained by woolfe and collaborators showing that the homologous region b of the zebrafish pax6a is suffcient to target expression also in the retina  <cit> . secondly, xu and collaborators report that the conserved c region, enables the mouse pax <dig> p <dig> promoter to drive reporter expression in some progenitor cells within the retina  <cit> . our transgenic zebrafish do not show any gfp/dsred expression in retinal progenitor cells, but only at later stage, in differentiated retinal neurons .

our study also demonstrates that the zebrafish pax6b p <dig> promoter drives expression in the telencephalon and in enteroendocrine cells, whereas no such expression has been reported with the mouse p <dig> promoter. such differences are quite surprising and puzzling. the activity of the mouse pax <dig> p <dig> promoter in the enteroendocrine cells of transgenic mice has probably been missed, as the developing gut produces a non specific lacz background staining likely to mask expression in the scattered enteroendocrine cells. thus, it would be interesting to re-examine the developing gut of the pax6:lacz transgenic mice by other approaches . our study identifies, for the first time, a regulatory region in the pax <dig> locus driving expression in enteroendocrine cells; this enhancer requires the conserved b and c regions.

finally, there are no reports of lacz reporter expression in the telencephalon with the mouse pax <dig> p <dig> promoter, in contrast to our data on the zebrafish pax6b p <dig> promoter. telencephalon-specific enhancers have been detected within the murine pax <dig> locus but they are located upstream from the p <dig> promoter, in intron  <dig> and far downstream from the gene  <cit> . translocation of such enhancers within the zebrafish pax6b promoter is very unlikely, as bioinformatic analyses have failed to reveal any significant sequence similarity to these enhancers. furthermore, our data of stable transgenic fish show that expression in the telencephalon requires all the conserved regions a, b and c. more deletion constructs will be necessary to delineate more precisely the regulatory elements controlling pax6b transcription in the telencephalon.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study shows that the two zebrafish pax <dig> genes are differentially expressed and that this is attributable to divergence in two conserved regulatory cis-elements binding the pancreatic factor pdx <dig>  we also demonstrate that the zebrafish pax6b p <dig> promoter targets expression not only to the endocrine pancreas, but also to the retina, the telencephalon, the diencephalon and to enteroendocrine cells. further interspecies sequence comparisons and analysis of additional transgenic constructs will help to delineate precisely the regulatory elements targeting these different tissues.
