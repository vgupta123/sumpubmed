BACKGROUND
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ  is a ligand activated transcription factor with particularly high abundance in small intestine, colon, liver, and skin  <cit> . in these tissues, pparβ/δ likely has a constitutive physiological role, possibly modulated by the presence of an endogenous ligand. this is consistent with the fact that pparβ/δ is required to mediate the induction of terminal differentiation in epithelial cells  <cit> . pparβ/δ also attenuates inflammation and regulates glucose and lipid homeostasis  <cit> . these important physiological roles underscore the potential for targeting pparβ/δ for the prevention and/or treatment of diverse diseases, including cancer, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemias  <cit> .

pparβ/δ modulates cellular function by regulating gene expression through several mechanisms. for example, pparβ/δ can interact and bind with other transcription factors, including nfκb, erk <dig>  and stat <dig>  and attenuate their signaling  <cit> . pparβ/δ can also repress gene expression by dynamically binding to chromatin in association with co-repressors  <cit> . the most commonly described mechanism by which pparβ/δ was thought to regulate gene expression is that binding of ligand to receptor induces a conformational change in the protein. this change in structure is accompanied by the release of co-repressors, heterodimerization with the retinoid x receptor , recruitment of co-activators and rna polymerase ii and increased transcription when this complex is bound to peroxisome proliferator response elements  proximal to target genes. however, more recent studies indicate that nuclear receptors actually regulate gene expression through dynamic and sometimes transient interactions with chromatin rather than through static complexes occupying chromatin  <cit> . this suggests that the dynamic and transient occupancy of pparβ/δ on chromatin must be considered when attempting to interpret receptor-dna binding studies  <cit> . there are many different classes of enzymes that can modify nucleosome location and/or chromatin structure that will allow for nuclear receptors to dynamically and transiently bind to chromatin, and this binding can be markedly changed in response to the presence of endogenous and exogenous ligands  <cit> . further, there is evidence that the dynamic interactions between agonist-activated nuclear receptors with their co-regulators and dna binding sites can lead to highly variable responses including differences in: 1) the regions of chromatin occupied by the receptor, 2) expression of target genes and 3) the ultimate biological effect. conformational changes in a receptor caused by different agonists, antagonists and partial agonists can cause differential recruitment of co-regulators resulting in alteration of the dynamics of transcriptional complexes and interactions with dna binding sites. thus, there are multiple levels of regulation by which pparβ/δ can influence the expression of target genes.

characterization of bona fide target genes directly regulated by pparβ/δ in all tissues is incomplete. angiopoietin-like  <dig>  and adipocyte differentiation-related protein  are two genes that can be modulated by pparβ/δ by direct transcriptional regulation. that angptl <dig> and adrp are direct target genes is based on analyses demonstrating: 1) that functional ppres exist proximal to these genes, and 2) confirmed promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ following ligand activation  <cit> . in addition to these experimentally confirmed pparβ/δ target genes, in silico screening based on genomic ppre frequency predicted as many as  <dig> to  <dig> targets for ppars in the human genome  <cit>  and a comparable number of binding sites for ppars in some cells have been confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing   <cit> . this suggests that many pparβ/δ binding sites and target genes remain unidentified. moreover, recent studies have used next generation sequencing to elucidate novel regulatory roles for pparβ/δ. for example, chip-seq was used to demonstrate that pparβ/δ and pparγ can be exchanged on target gene in adipocytes, following ligand activation of pparγ  <cit> . thus, the present studies were designed to examine novel regulation of pparβ/δ-dependent gene transcription in keratinocytes.

RESULTS
pparβ/δ-dependent regulation of genes in keratinocytes
six hundred and twelve genes were identified by genome-wide expression profiling that were differentially regulated by either ligand, disruption of pparβ/δ, or both . these genes were categorized into four major response types:  repression without exogenous ligand ,  activation without exogenous ligand ,  activation with exogenous ligand , and  repression with exogenous ligand . qpcr confirmed these four common types of pparβ/δ-dependent changes in gene expression detected by microarray analysis . combined, these comprised  <dig> % of the genes identified that were differentially regulated by either ligand, disruption of pparβ/δ, or both. an additional four response types exhibiting combined responses were also observed:  repression without exogenous ligand and activation with exogenous ligand ,  activation without exogenous ligand and repression with exogenous ligand ,  activation with and without exogenous ligand , and  repression with and without exogenous ligand  . the latter four response types only comprised ~5% of the genes modulated by gw <dig> and/or disruption of pparβ/δ.

the effect without exogenous ligand reflects the response in expression of a particular gene observed in control pparβ/δ-null keratinocytes as compared to control wild-type keratinocytes. for this column, repression indicates that gene expression is higher in pparβ/δ-null cells as compared to wild-type cells and activation indicates that gene expression is lower in pparβ/δ-null cells as compared to wild-type cells. the effect with exogenous ligand reflects the response in expression of a particular gene observed in wild-type keratinocytes treated with the highly specific pparβ/δ ligand gw <dig> as compared to control wild-type keratinocytes. for this column, activation indicates that gene expression is higher in gw0742-treated wild-type cells as compared to control wild-type cells and repression indicates that gene expression is lower in gw0742-treated wild-type cells as compared to control wild-type cells.

characterization of the pparβ/δ target genes and their transcriptional responses was undertaken by functional category enrichment analysis  <cit> . 50% of the enriched functional categories were common between type i and type ii responses . genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism were common between type iii and type v responses . the level of gene expression observed following ligand activation was compared to changes in gene expression observed by disruption of pparβ/δ . this analysis revealed clustering for the eight different response types, but there were differences in the magnitude of change found for each of the response types . the conventional view accounting for combined responses involving activation/repression in both the presence and absence of exogenous ligand  suggests that a ligand-mediated switch occurs between repression and activation  or vice-versa   <cit> . for example, in the absence of pparβ/δ, expression of lpcat <dig> is enhanced because pparβ/δ represses expression, whereas ligand activation of pparβ/δ increases expression of lpcat <dig>  this phenomenon was also observed with type vi genes, consistent with a ligand-mediated release of an activating complex. however, it is important to point out that the level of ligand-dependent expression typically exhibited in type v genes was of generally greater magnitude  as compared to the level of expression observed when pparβ/δ was disrupted, but this effect was not found for type vi responses . this suggests that ligand and receptor-dependent regulation of gene expression can be mediated by distinctly different mechanisms, even for a single gene.

genome-wide characterization of pparβ/δ occupancy on chromatin
chip-seq was performed to examine the molecular mechanisms by which pparβ/δ regulates gene expression. to accomplish this, a chip-grade antibody is required. a polyclonal anti-pparβ/δ antibody  <cit>  was ~94x more efficient for immunoprecipitation of vitro translated pparβ/δ as compared to one commercially available anti-pparβ/δ antibody  <cit> . further, this antibody was effective for demonstrating increased promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ on the angptl <dig> promoter in mouse keratinocytes following ligand activation of pparβ/δ  and was used for chip-seq to identify pparβ/δ cistromes in keratinocytes. between  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads per sample were obtained by chip-seq and more than 98% of these reads were retained after quality control. of these reads, between  <dig> and 73% were successfully mapped to the mouse genome for the control and gw0742-treated samples .

the number of reads per sample is shown for each of two runs, along with the total number of reads obtained for bioinformatic analysis. the percentage of total reads that passed quality control as described in materials and methods  and the number  and percentage of reads that were successfully mapped to the mouse genome  are shown.

bioinformatic analysis of chip-seq data revealed occupancy of pparβ/δ on  <dig>  sites in chromatin from control cells  and  <dig>  sites in chromatin from gw <dig> treated cells ; their absence in equivalent pparβ/δ-null cells confirmed specificity . the region of dna amplified by chip qpcr showing increased promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ on the angptl <dig> gene following ligand activation  was also associated with significant occupancy of pparβ/δ based on chip-seq analysis  confirming specificity of promoter occupancy detected by chip-seq. annotation of the genomic features associated with the identified peaks revealed unique patterns of pparβ/δ occupancy on specific chromosomes . as compared to the percentage of bases in the entire mouse genome per chromosome, the percentage of peaks identified by chip-seq that were associated with pparβ/δ binding was significantly greater on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and significantly less on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x in control, wild-type keratinocytes . as compared to the percentage of bases in the entire mouse genome per chromosome, the percentage of peaks identified by chip-seq that were associated with pparβ/δ binding was significantly greater on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and significantly less on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> following ligand activation of pparβ/δ . annotation of the genomic features associated with the identified peaks also revealed that the majority of pparβ/δ binding to chromatin is found at intronic sites , with significant enrichment also observed in the upstream  and downstream  regions from the tss; which varied depending on the distance upstream from the transcriptional start site ; figures 4c, 4d). however, as compared to the percentage of bases in the entire mouse genome that represents intronic sequences , the percentage of peaks identified by chip-seq that were associated with pparβ/δ binding  was not strikingly different . in contrast, as compared to the percentage of bases in the entire mouse genome that are in relatively close proximity to the tss , the percentage of peaks identified by chip-seq that were associated with pparβ/δ binding  was between 3- and 7-fold higher .

integrative analysis of the pparβ/δ transcriptome and cistrome
binding regions were assigned gene names according to the nearest tss. as transcription factors may regulate genes at distal loci , a high-confidence binding site and direct target gene set was obtained by identifying genes exhibiting both pparβ/δ occupancy within ±  <dig> kb of the gene, and pparβ/δ-dependent differential expression as revealed by microarray analysis .  <dig> genes were identified that exhibited pparβ/δ occupancy on chromatin without exogenous ligand and exhibited pparβ/δ-dependent differential expression . further,  <dig> genes were identified that exhibited pparβ/δ occupancy on chromatin with exogenous ligand and exhibited pparβ/δ-dependent differential expression . twenty-six of these genes exhibited pparβ/δ occupancy on chromatin with and without exogenous ligand and exhibited pparβ/δ-dependent differential expression . this integrated, high-confidence “direct target gene set” and “binding region set” was utilized for analyses of pparβ/δ-chromatin interactions .

of the  <dig> pparβ/δ-dependent differentially regulated genes detected with the microarray analysis,  <dig>  of these genes also displayed pparβ/δ occupancy within  <dig> kb of the tss . fifty-seven of the  <dig> direct target genes exhibited a type i response and promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ was found in  <dig>  of these genes within  <dig> kb of the tss in the absence of exogenous ligand . interestingly, in  <dig> of these genes, pparβ/δ occupancy was only detected in the presence of exogenous ligand . of the  <dig> direct pparβ/δ genes exhibiting a type ii response, promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ was found in  <dig>  of these genes within  <dig> kb of the tss in the absence of exogenous ligand  but in  <dig> of these genes, pparβ/δ occupancy was only detected in the presence of exogenous ligand . the occupancy of pparβ/δ within  <dig> kb of the tss found with and without exogenous ligand was relatively equally distributed with more predominant occupancy near the tss for both type i and type ii response genes . thirty-one of the  <dig> direct target genes exhibited a type iii response and promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ within  <dig> kb of the tss was found for all of these genes but was found in the absence and/or presence of exogenous ligand . for type iii response genes, occupancy of pparβ/δ without exogenous ligand occurred more predominantly near the tss with some skewness in the region downstream of the tss . in the presence of exogenous ligand, the occupancy of pparβ/δ observed for type iii response genes was predominant near the tss but there was a shift in binding towards the region upstream of the tss compared to the occupancy of pparβ/δ observed without exogenous ligand . of the  <dig> direct pparβ/δ genes that exhibited a type iv response, promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ within  <dig> kb of the tss was found for all of these genes in the absence and/or presence of exogenous ligand . for type iv response genes, in the absence of exogenous ligand occupancy of pparβ/δ was near the tss with a cluster of binding in the region upstream of the tss and some skewness in the region downstream of the tss . the occupancy of pparβ/δ observed for type iv response genes in the presence of exogenous ligand was shifted towards the region upstream of the tss compared to the occupancy of pparβ/δ observed without exogenous ligand . four of the  <dig> direct target genes exhibited a type v response and promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ within  <dig> kb of the tss was found for all of these genes in the absence and/or presence of exogenous ligand . of the  <dig> direct pparβ/δ genes that exhibited a type vi response, promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ within  <dig> kb of the tss was found for all of these genes in the absence and/or presence of exogenous ligand . the single type vii response gene detected by microarray analysis did not exhibit occupancy of pparβ/δ based on this analysis. three of the  <dig> direct target genes exhibited a type viii response and promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ within  <dig> kb of the tss was found for all of these genes in the absence and/or presence of exogenous ligand . chip-qpcr was performed for representative genes from the four major response types to confirm pparβ/δ occupancy and chromatin modifications .

unique dna binding motifs near sites of pparβ/δ occupancy on chromatin
a consensus ppre motif for pparβ/δ was generated using a list of  <dig> validated ppre consensus sequences obtained from the literature  <cit>  using stamp  <cit>  . this sequence was used to search for matches in the chip-seq peaks in both control and gw0742-treated samples. the consensus ppre motif identified from this analysis was gggncaaaggtca . the rxr half-site was conserved whereas the pparβ/δ half-site showed some variation as compared to the consensus ppre motif based on the published literature . consensus binding sites for a number of other transcription factors were also found in proximity to regions where pparβ/δ occupancy was noted . for example, in control chromatin from wild-type keratinocytes not treated with an exogenous ligand, a high percentage  of consensus binding sites for elf <dig>  elk <dig>  etv <dig> and pax <dig> were also found in chip-seq peaks . additionally, in chromatin from wild-type keratinocytes treated with gw <dig>  a high percentage  of consensus binding sites for atf <dig>  e4f <dig>  erg, nr1h <dig>  and zfp <dig> were also found in chip-seq peaks . differences in the presence of consensus binding sites for a number of transcription factors were also found in regions where pparβ/δ occupancy was noted between response types . for genes exhibiting a type i response, a high percentage  of consensus binding sites for mycn, nr1h2:rxr, and rfx <dig> were also found in chip-seq peaks in chromatin from wild-type keratinocytes . a high percentage  of consensus binding sites for elk <dig>  elk <dig>  erg, ts <dig>  fli <dig>  and gm <dig> were also found in chip-seq peaks in chromatin from wild-type keratinocytes for genes exhibiting a type ii response . for genes exhibiting a type iii response, a high percentage  of consensus binding sites for atf <dig>  duxbl, e4f <dig>  mecp <dig>  and znf <dig> were also found in chip-seq peaks in chromatin from wild-type keratinocytes . related transcription factors were grouped by phylogenic analysis revealing two major families of transcription factor binding sites, ets and creb/atf/ap <dig>  that were associated near regions where pparβ/δ was found to occupy . interestingly, binding sites for the ets family of transcription factors were found near regions of chromatin occupied by pparβ/δ in either the presence or absence of exogenous ligand, whereas binding sites for the creb/atf/ap <dig> family of transcription factors were more commonly found in regions of chromatin occupied by pparβ/δ only in the presence of ligand . no significant enrichment of consensus binding sites for other transcription factors were found in chip-seq peaks from the type iv-viii response genes.

co-regulation of pparβ/δ target genes by atf4
because atf <dig> binding motifs were commonly observed proximal to pparβ/δ binding regions, chip assays were performed to confirm that both transcription factors occupied these regions of dna. interestingly, for three type iii response genes  and one type v gene , ligand activation of pparβ/δ was associated with an increase in promoter occupancy of both pparβ/δ and atf <dig> . this effect was not observed in pparβ/δ-null cells. because effective knockdown of atf <dig> could not be achieved in primary keratinocytes, the sp <dig> keratinocyte cell line  <cit>  was used to examine the effect of atf <dig> knockdown. of the three atf <dig> shrna vectors used, effective knockdown of atf <dig> was achieved with two of the vectors . interestingly, when atf <dig> was knocked down, the relative increase in gene expression of the type iii genes adrp, prickle <dig>  and snai <dig> observed following ligand activation of pparβ/δ was reduced . additionally, the relative increase in gene expression of the type v gene angptl <dig> observed following ligand activation of pparβ/δ was also markedly reduced when atf <dig> was knocked down .

discussion
results from the present study are the first to demonstrate genome-wide changes in gene expression mediated specifically by pparβ/δ in mouse keratinocytes. keratinocytes provide an outstanding model to examine gene expression mediated by pparβ/δ because of the constitutively high expression of the receptor  <cit> . comparison of wild-type and pparβ/δ-null keratinocytes revealed that pparβ/δ constitutively regulates expression of  <dig> genes. further, activation of pparβ/δ altered expression of  <dig> genes that required pparβ/δ. the ultimate phenotype resulting from ligand activation of pparβ/δ in keratinocytes cannot be determined based solely on the gene expression profiles obtained from these studies but they are consistent with previous studies showing that activating pparβ/δ in keratinocytes and/or skin promotes terminal differentiation, inhibits cell proliferation, improves barrier function and inhibits inflammation  <cit> . thus, it is also worth noting that activating pparβ/δ can induce terminal differentiation and modulate lipid metabolism in keratinocytes coincident with changes in the regulation of target genes observed in these studies, consistent with previous work  <cit> . expression of pdpk <dig>  ilk, or pten was not altered by ligand activation of pparβ/δ in the present studies, which is also in line with a previous study  <cit> , but in contrast to another study  <cit> . increased expression of hb-egf and many pro-inflammatory genes was also reported in human keratinocytes and skin of transgenic mice over-expressing human pparβ/δ, respectively, following activation with a pparβ/δ ligand  <cit> . however, changes in expression of these genes were not observed in the present studies. further work is needed to determine the reason for these inconsistencies.

genes were categorized into eight distinct response types representing essentially every combination of transcriptional activation and/or repression in response to exogenous ligand and/or pparβ/δ disruption. interestingly, the type i and ii responses that occur independent of exogenous ligand were the most commonly observed . there are two existing models that could explain this regulation. first, pparβ/δ can dynamically occupy chromatin in association with co-repressors leading to repression of gene expression  <cit> . this model explains why type i genes are induced in pparβ/δ-null keratinocytes in the absence of exogenous ligand. whether an endogenous ligand is part of this complex remains uncertain. chip-seq analysis confirmed promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ in some genes exhibiting a type i response. the second model is that the pparβ/δ-rxr heterodimer in association with co-activators and rna polymerase ii is dynamically binding chromatin as a result of the presence of an endogenous ligand or ligands, and available chromatin binding sites as a result of the activities of dna modifying enzymes  <cit> . thus, when pparβ/δ is disrupted, the expression of these type ii genes is reduced. this is in agreement with the promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ detected by chip-seq for some genes exhibiting a type ii response. the fact that occupancy of pparβ/δ was not detected for all of the type i and ii genes is likely due to: 1) the dynamic fluid nature of pparβ/δ binding with chromatin, which has multiple levels of regulation, 2) the fact that ppres for these genes could exist in chromatin at distant sites not in close proximity to the tss  <cit> , or 3) local chromatin status at some ppres may preclude binding at those sites  <cit> . of the functional categories of genes that exhibited type i or ii responses, approximately 50% of these categories were altered by both response types, suggesting common factors that induce these changes are somewhat independent of the direction of the regulation observed .

type iii and iv responses that were dependent on exogenous ligand activation, were the next most common type of gene regulation observed . these responses were characterized by a lack of constitutive regulation by pparβ/δ, but regulatory changes arising after treatment with exogenous ligand. type iii responses are consistent with dynamic nuclear receptor-mediated up-regulation of target gene expression  <cit> . indeed, less promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ was found in the absence of exogenous ligand and increased promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ was noted following ligand activation. it is curious to note that expression of type ii target genes was not increased by an exogenous ligand, since it appears that constitutive expression of type ii genes is driven by an endogenous ligand. in contrast, constitutive expression of type iii response genes did not appear to be altered by an endogenous ligand, and was only increased by an exogenous ligand. there are at least two mechanisms that could explain these differences. first, the presence of an endogenous ligand in relatively high concentration  that also exhibits higher affinity for pparβ/δ as compared to gw <dig> could explain why an exogenous ligand does not further increase expression of a type ii response gene. this would suggest that there are different endogenous ligands that cause differential conformational changes in the receptor following ligand activation and/or differences in the recruitment of co-effector proteins to the complex to modulate specific subsets of pparβ/δ target genes. alternatively, the concentration of an exogenous ligand could be greater than an endogenous ligand and sufficient to activate the receptor, and/or have higher affinity for pparβ/δ than an endogenous ligand . this scenario also implies that the ligand could uniquely alter receptor conformation and/or recruitment of co-effector proteins to the transcriptional complex as compared to that which occurs in response to an endogenous ligand. the data from the present studies also indicate that pparβ/δ does not influence expression of type iv genes in the absence of exogenous ligand, but that ligand activation causes recruitment of pparβ/δ to regions near the tss and this increase in occupancy is associated with repression of gene expression for  <dig> genes. whereas repression of gene expression observed for type i response genes could be mediated by dynamic occupancy of pparβ/δ in the absence of exogenous ligands in complex with co-repressors as suggested by other studies  <cit> , the precise mechanism that underlies this exogenous ligand-dependent effect is uncertain and requires further studies. in general, there was a lack of overlap between the functional categories of regulatory pathways modulated by type i/ii as compared to type iii/iv response genes. this supports the view that pparβ/δ is integrated into distinct transcriptional response pathways mediated by distinct mechanisms that may be influenced by more than one endogenous ligand. the fact that pparβ/δ has a relatively large ligand binding domain as compared to other ppars  <cit>  and nuclear receptors supports the idea that pparβ/δ can accommodate more than one endogenous ligand. moreover, this analysis also suggested that pparβ/δ can tightly bind more than one type of fatty acid, a feature that interfered with solving the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain  <cit> , consistent with the hypothesis that more than one endogenous ligand exists for pparβ/δ.

mixed responses were observed for a much smaller cohort of pparβ/δ target genes . type v response genes exhibited responses that were similar to those found with type i and iii genes because in the absence of exogenous ligand and pparβ/δ, expression was higher yet ligand activation of pparβ/δ caused an increase in expression. conversely, type vi response genes exhibited responses that were similar to those found with type ii and iv genes because in the absence of exogenous ligand and pparβ/δ, expression was lower and ligand activation of pparβ/δ caused a decrease in expression. one mechanism that explains these response types is that a ligand-mediated switch occurs between repression and activation  or vice-versa   <cit> . for example, when pparβ/δ is disrupted, expression of angptl <dig> is enhanced because pparβ/δ represses expression, whereas ligand activation of pparβ/δ increases expression of angptl <dig>  this phenomenon was inversed but also observed with type vi genes, consistent with a ligand-mediated release of an activating complex. however, it is important to point out that constitutive expression angptl <dig> and other type v response genes were typically much lower than the levels observed following activation by an exogenous ligand. this is consistent with a model where pparβ/δ represses without an endogenous ligand and that binding of ligand to the receptor causes recruitment of transcriptional proteins and increased transcription after forming a transcriptional complex that increases transcription and/or outcompetes the repressive complex for repression. alternatively, an exogenous ligand could alter the ratio of repressive pparβ/δ complexes to activated pparβ/δ complexes limiting the availability of pparβ/δ to form repressive complexes on chromatin. results from the analysis of type v genes in the present studies is in contrast to previous work by others showing comparable levels of expression of genes following either pparβ/δ knockdown or activation by an exogenous ligand in human wpmy <dig> myofibroblast cells  <cit> , for genes exhibiting similar regulation as observed in the present studies. this could reflect differences in: 1) the concentration of available ligand, 2) chromatin structure near the angptl <dig> gene, and/or 3) co-effector proteins recruited to alter chromatin structure. the single type vii response gene exhibited a response that was similar to that found with type ii and iii genes because in the absence of exogenous ligand and pparβ/δ, expression was modestly lower and ligand activation of pparβ/δ with gw <dig> caused an increase in expression. the type vii response is consistent with a model whereby an endogenous ligand drives constitutive expression and an exogenous ligand increases this expression through mechanisms described above for type ii and iii response types. in contrast, type viii response genes exhibited a response that was similar to those found with type i and iv genes because in the absence of exogenous ligand and pparβ/δ, expression was modestly higher and ligand activation of pparβ/δ with gw <dig> caused a decrease in expression. the type viii response is consistent with a model whereby constitutive expression is repressed and exogenous ligand also causes repression through mechanisms described above for type i and iv response types.

there are several possible explanations for the lack of detecting pparβ/δ occupancy near the tss of the different response type genes. it is possible that pparβ/δ regulates these genes in regions further away than ±  <dig> kb from the tss, or that regulation is mediated by another direct pparβ/δ target gene that in turn directly regulates the target genes. this mechanism is likely for the type vii response gene because promoter occupancy of pparβ/δ was not detected within  <dig> kb of the tss. alternatively, pparβ/δ could occupy the regulatory regions of the response genes, but the chip may not be sensitive enough to effectively pull down chromatin with bound pparβ/δ, which could be influenced by the relative ability of the antibody to bind with pparβ/δ. the relative antibody binding to pparβ/δ occupying chromatin could be impaired if: 1) conformational changes resulting from different co-effector molecules bound to pparβ/δ are present, limiting access of the receptor to the antibody, 2) pparβ/δ is indirectly bound to chromatin as part of a larger regulatory complex, 3) proteins are bound to pparβ/δ as a result of the crosslinking step of the chip, and/or 4) the residence time of pparβ/δ is too brief to register a signal in the chip-seq analysis because the receptor is rapidly exchanging with chromatin as observed with many other receptors  <cit> .

pparβ/δ target genes were recently identified from microarray analysis of human myofibroblast-like cells following either sirna knockdown of pparβ/δ or ligand activation of pparβ/δ in these cells  <cit> . adhikary and colleagues identified  <dig> genes that were regulated by a pparβ/δ ligand in human wpmy <dig> cells  <cit> , whereas only  <dig> genes were specifically regulated by ligand activation of pparβ/δ in mouse keratinocytes in the present study . of the  <dig> genes that were regulated by ligand activation of pparβ/δ in mouse keratinocytes,  <dig>  were also regulated by ligand activation of pparβ/δ in human wpmy <dig> cells  <cit> . adhikary and colleagues also identified  <dig> genes that were regulated following knockdown of pparβ/δ in human wpmy <dig> cells  <cit> . in contrast,  <dig> genes were differentially regulated in the absence of pparβ/δ expression in mouse keratinocytes in the present study. of the  <dig> genes that were differentially regulated by pparβ/δ in mouse keratinocytes as detected by comparing wild-type and pparβ/δ-null cells,  <dig>  were also regulated by disrupting expression of pparβ/δ in human wpmy <dig> cells  <cit> . thus, of the  <dig> genes that were regulated by pparβ/δ in mouse primary keratinocytes,  <dig> of these genes were also regulated by pparβ/δ in wpmy <dig> cells . for approximately 50% of these genes, the response type exhibited was identical between mouse primary keratinocytes and wpmy <dig> cells . many interchanges of response types were observed between the remaining genes but interchanges from type ii to type i, type iii to type i, and type i to type ii were slightly more commonly noted in mouse primary keratinocytes as compared to wpmy <dig> cell . collectively, these observations demonstrate that pparβ/δ regulates some common sets of genes in human and mouse cells, but that there can also be differences in the molecular targets and the types of regulation observed. these differences might be due to the presence or absence of one or more endogenous ligand, differences in accessibility to regulatory regions of chromatin, species differences in the sequences of binding motifs, differences in the approach used to delete/knockdown pparβ/δ , and/or possible species differences in the expression levels of the three ppars between the two cell types.

the present studies identified eight different, pparβ/δ-dependent response types of genes in mouse keratinocytes. in contrast, others characterized only three different pparβ/δ-dependent response types in human wpmy <dig> cells  <cit> . to facilitate comparisons with the present study, data from adhikary  <cit>  was re-examined and indeed, all eight different response types were evident in these data. in mouse keratinocytes, constitutive expression of  <dig>  target genes was regulated by pparβ/δ through type i and ii responses. in human wpmy <dig> cells,  <dig> genes  were also regulated through either a type i or type ii response  <cit> . type iii and iv responses observed following activation of pparβ/δ with an exogenous ligand were observed for  <dig> genes  in mouse keratinocytes while  <dig> target genes  were regulated by similar mechanisms in human wpmy <dig> cells  <cit> . lastly, types v-viii responses were observed for  <dig> genes  in mouse keratinocytes, whereas  <dig> genes  were modulated similarly in wpmy <dig> cells  <cit> . these data suggest that regulation of gene expression in mouse keratinocytes and human wpmy <dig> cells is likely mediated in large part by the one or more endogenous ligand, and that activation of pparβ/δ with an exogenous ligand modulates expression of a relatively smaller set of genes as compared to those that are regulated by pparβ/δ endogenously.

chip-seq analysis revealed new insight into the functional role of pparβ/δ in the regulation of gene expression in keratinocytes. pparβ/δ is constitutively enriched on chromatin on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and in response to exogenous ligand activation, pparβ/δ is enriched on chromatin located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these findings indicate an important role for pparβ/δ in regulating genes encoded on these chromosomes. interestingly, while chip-seq demonstrated that pparβ/δ was present near ~ <dig> genes in the mouse genome, only  <dig> of these genes were regulated by pparβ/δ when compared with microarray analysis. this is likely due in part to the presence of pparβ/δ in intronic sequences that may or may not be functional. one mechanism that might explain the occupancy of pparβ/δ on chromatin not associated with genes that were found to be regulated based on microarray analysis is that pparβ/δ may require the presence of other transcription factors or signaling molecules in order to modulate gene expression. for example, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  occupies the interleukin  <dig>  promoter but does not modulate expression of il <dig> unless nf-kb becomes activated through il1β-dependent signaling  <cit> . this type of signaling paradigm has not been examined to date for pparβ/δ, and results from the present studies suggest this possibility could exist and should be examined in future studies. this suggests that while  <dig> genes were regulated specifically by pparβ/δ, many of these changes appear to be mediated by mechanisms that are secondary to effects induced by the direct target genes. alternatively, it remains possible that there are more direct target genes, but the regulatory elements are more distal than ±  <dig> kb from tss.

chip-seq analysis provided a unique opportunity to begin to examine the molecular mechanisms by which pparβ/δ differentially regulates gene expression. a consensus ppre was derived from these analyses and was comparable to ppres identified for other pparβ/δ target genes  <cit> . no consistent differences in the ppre sequences were identified that were able to distinguish between the different response types. however, the presence of binding site motifs for other transcription factors was observed that distinguished between effects observed with and without exogenous ligand. for example, the ets binding sites were commonly present near the ppre of genes that were modulated in the presence or absence of exogenous ligand, whereas the creb/atf/ap <dig> binding sites were commonly present near the ppre of genes that were modulated only in the presence of exogenous ligand. interestingly, different patterns of consensus binding sites of various transcription factors were also noted near the ppre of genes that exhibited types i, ii and iii responses, but not for the other five response types. of particular interest, is the novel finding that pparβ/δ cooperates with atf <dig> in modulating expression of some target genes. this suggests that pparβ/δ requires cooperation with other transcription factors to specifically regulate subsets of genes. a similar phenomenon has also been found for other transcription factors  <cit> . while the physiological role of atf <dig> in modulating pparβ/δ-dependent gene expression and function requires further investigation, this type of interaction might begin to explain some of the complex regulation associated with the dynamic and fluid nature of nuclear receptor binding with chromatin.

CONCLUSIONS
keratinocytes express high levels of pparβ/δ and thus provide an ideal model to study the role of this transcription factor in gene expression. comparisons of gene expression profiles between wild-type and pparβ/δ-null keratinocytes treated with and without a highly specific ligand identified  <dig> genes that were modulated either constitutively or by the addition of an exogenous ligand. many of these changes in gene expression appear to be modulated by the presence of an endogenous ligand because expression is altered when pparβ/δ is genetically silenced. chip-seq analysis revealed that only  <dig> of these  <dig> genes exhibit direct binding of pparβ/δ within ±  <dig> kb of the tss. this suggests that: 1) pparβ/δ may indirectly regulate some of the  <dig> genes, 2) the dynamic nature of pparβ/δ binding and interacting with chromatin prevents detection of receptor occupancy by chip-seq, and/or 3) pparβ/δ may directly regulate these genes by binding with chromatin at more distant sites. the diversity in response types detected from this analysis supports a model of pparβ/δ interacting with chromatin through dynamic binding and interactions; differences in receptor activity induced by endogenous versus exogenous ligands may explain part of this diversity. the presence of additional transcription factors can influence the activity of pparβ/δ in keratinocytes. interestingly, there can be considerable overlap in target genes and response types observed between human and mouse cells.
