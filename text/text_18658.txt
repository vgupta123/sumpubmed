BACKGROUND
pigs are one of the most important sources of animal proteins for the human population. however, due to intensive rearing, pigs are also highly susceptible to various pathogens including those with zoonotic potential. salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is an example of a zoonotic agent for which pigs represent a reservoir for the human population. in fact, pigs represent the second most common source of salmonella for humans after poultry and are the most important source if only serovar s. typhimurium is considered.

salmonella in pigs is transmitted by the oral-fecal route. infections of pigs with s. typhimurium are often asymptomatic  <cit>  although mild diarrhea may be recorded at the early stage of infection  <cit> . after initial multiplication in the gut lumen, s. typhimurium invades the intestinal epithelial cells and comes into contact with the host’s immune system  <cit> . the innate immune responses of different parts of porcine intestinal tract have been repeatedly described . of the different leukocyte subpopulations, mononuclear phagocyte cells are of key importance for the outcome of salmonella infection which comprise of macrophages  and dendritic cells . when these cells come into contact with bacterial pathogens, they recognize the pathogens through the presence of pathogen associated molecular patterns  present in prokaryotic pathogens but absent from eukaryotic host cells. this leads to the modification of gene expression in mΦ and dc, and secretion of signaling molecules to coordinate responses of other cells of the host immune system. in addition, both mΦ and dc are able to take up, process and present antigens to lymphocytes, thereby inducing the development of an adaptive immune response  <cit> .

although only particular subsets of mΦ and dc can be differentiated from a monocyte precursor, their capacity to take up, process and present antigen differ significantly. there are several papers to date describing the expression profiles of selected genes in porcine monocytes, dendritic cells or macrophages in response to external stimuli . however, these studies compared the responses either monocytes and monocyte derived dendritic cells   <cit> , two differently generated macrophages  <cit>  or two different dc populations  <cit> . the response of mΦ and dc derived from monocytes has never been compared. moreover, all the studies either determined the expression of preselected genes such as tlrs, mhc-ii molecules, chemokines and cytokines by quantitative rt-pcr or used the affymetrix microarray, so the measurements were limited to the level of transcription. since the general understanding of antigen presentation and associated processes, especially in a porcine model, is far from being completely understood, in this study, we therefore differentiated porcine monocyte-derived macrophages  and modc, and compared their response to s. typhimurium and one of the most potent bacterial pamp, bacterial lps. to avoid any bias, expression was determined by protein lc-ms/ms and verified at the level of transcription by qrt-pcr. using such an approach, we concluded that the difference in the response of momΦ and modc was quantitative rather than qualitative, i.e. modc responded less extensively than momΦ to lps or s. typhimurium stimulation.

RESULTS
cell differentiation
depending on culture conditions, peripheral blood monocytes differentiated into two populations with distinct morphology within 4 days of culture. adhered monocytes differentiated into momΦ of spherical shape with characteristic short hairy protrusions on their surface. on the other hand, monocytes treated with il <dig> and gm-csf differentiated into modc characteristic by elongated cells with numerous dendrites typical of dendritic cells .figure  <dig>

flow cytometric analysis further confirmed the difference between the two cell populations. the most remarkable difference was a more than  <dig> times higher expression of mhc-ii molecules on the surface of modc compared to momΦ. the expression of cd <dig> and cd11a, when compared to momΦ, was numerically but not significantly higher in modc . on the other hand, expression of cd172α, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  tlr- <dig> and tlr- <dig> did not differ between both cell types . the expression of surface molecules on modc and momΦ was also determined after s. typhimurium infection. in response to infection, the amount of cd <dig> increased in both cell types whereas the expression of the remaining cell surface molecules did not change .figure  <dig>

protein mass spectrometry
the previous experiment showed that cd <dig> increased both in momΦ and modc after s. typhimurium infection. in the next experiment, we therefore determined what other proteins might have increased in expression in both momΦ and modc. in addition to s. typhimurium infection, protein expression was also determined in the lps exposed cell cultures.

mass spectrometry detected at least once  <dig> proteins in momΦ and  <dig> proteins in modc . however, when we applied the filter criteria described below, the number of proteins decreased to  <dig> proteins which were repeatedly detected in momΦ and  <dig> in modc . out of the filtered proteins,  <dig> were detected in both momΦ and modc,  <dig> proteins were identified only in momΦ and  <dig> proteins were identified only in modc. the comparison of the momΦ and modc response to lps and s. typhimurium showed that momΦ were more responsive as the number of proteins induced more than  <dig> fold was higher in momΦ than in modc . the momΦ also showed a higher mean fold induction than the modc when comparing the proteins induced in both cell types .figure  <dig>

qrt-pcr
since mass spectrometry was performed in cells originating from only two donor pigs , proteomic expression data were therefore confirmed at the transcriptional level by quantitative real-time pcr to which additional samples from  <dig> different pigs were included. genes selected for qrt-pcr verification included those in which the summed fold inductions determined by lc-ms/ms following lps stimulation and s. typhimurium infection exceeded a factor of  <dig> in the case of the less responsive modc, or a factor of  <dig> in the case of the more responsive momΦ. the selection resulted in  <dig> genes/proteins  and the differential expression was confirmed by qrt-pcr in  <dig> genes .table  <dig>

out of these,  <dig> genes were induced both in momΦ and modc,  <dig> genes  were significantly induced in momΦ only and oldlr <dig> and cdc <dig> were significantly induced exclusively in modc. out of the  <dig> genes up-regulated in both cell types,  <dig> the most up-regulated ones encoded cytokines , cxcl <dig>  il <dig> and il1α). in agreement with the proteomic data, the fold inductions determined by qrt-pcr were usually higher in momΦ than in modcs, despite the fact that the differences between momΦ and modc responsiveness reached statistical significance only in  <dig> genes after exposure to lps and  <dig> genes after infection with s. typhimurium. this also means that the responsiveness of momΦ and modcs to lps was similar but dcs, unlike mΦ, did not extensively respond to s. typhimurium infection.

discussion
in this study we were interested in the interactions of porcine momΦ and modcs with lps and s. typhimurium. both cell morphology and flow cytometry indicated that the culture conditions led to the differentiation of distinct cell types. expression of surface molecules observed on modc was in agreement with the previous observations  <cit> . the up-regulation of cd <dig> in porcine alveolar macrophages following stimulation with lps or salmonella infection was also reported earlier  <cit> .

similar responses to free lps and s. typhimurium of both cell types indicate that lps is one of the dominant antigens of s. typhimurium. the infection of momΦ with s. typhimurium did cause induction of only  <dig> additional proteins compared to lps stimulated cells . in case of modc there were  <dig> proteins solely induced by s. typhimurium which represents less than one fifth of all proteins induced in modc. the higher stimulating potential of lps compared to infection with s. typhimurium was likely caused by the soluble character of lps which was present in media and homogenously stimulated all the cells. on the other hand, only about 10% of cells were invaded by s. typhimurium , so the remaining uninfected cells could respond only to lps released from bacterial cells into the medium during the experiments. the effect of indirect stimulation of infected cells toward their uninfected by-standers remains to be determined. both lc-ms/ms and real-time pcr showed that the differences in the expression of genes inducible both in momΦ and in modc were more pronounced in momΦ. together with the high expression of mhcii, this shows that the primary role of dc is antigen presentation whereas macrophages are involved in modulation of the environment by cytokine signaling.

eleven genes/proteins, il1β, amcf <dig>  cxcl <dig>  il <dig>  il1α, isg <dig>  marcksl <dig>  sod <dig>  iκbα, cd <dig> and vcam were induced by more than  <dig> fold. out of these, il1β, cxcl <dig>  amcf <dig>  il <dig>  il1α and the secreted form of isg <dig> have a cytokine and/or chemokine function and their expression is related to the nf-κb dependent proinflammatory pathway. the central role of the nf-κb pathway is further supported by the fact that more than half of the identified genes  contain the nf-κb binding site in the promoter. these genes could be considered as either involved in the nf-κb feedback loop   <cit>  or act as nf-κb targets: il1β, il1α, amcf <dig>  il <dig>  sod <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  opn, oldlr <dig>  hmox <dig> and vcam <dig> . il1β, amcf <dig>  il <dig>  cxcl <dig>  il1α, marcksl <dig>  sod <dig>  ppa <dig> and isg <dig> were also found among the top 10% of the most inducible genes of bone marrow derived porcine macrophages treated with lps  <cit> .

the differences between momΦ and modc responses were quite low. this could be caused by the fact that we selected the most inducible and highly abundant proteins, which had similar expression profiles following exposure to lps or s. typhimurium, and minority proteins responsible for the specificity of momΦ and modc remained unrecognized. the exceptions were represented by marcks-related gene/protein . this gene was expressed and induced in momΦ after exposure to both lps and s. typhimurium at a significantly higher rate than in modc. finally, its induction in lps stimulated momΦ was more than  <dig> fold indicating that this was a highly inducible gene.

marcksl <dig>  is expressed mainly in the brain, reproductive tissues, and macrophages  <cit>  and belongs to a family of the unstructured proteins that mediate cross-talk in cell-to-cell signaling. marcksl <dig> is involved in the regulation of cell migration, adhesion and phagocytosis, as well as in neurosecretion and brain development . transcription of marcksl <dig> is also strongly increased upon stimulation with bacterial lps . mancek-keber et al.  <cit>  showed that the marcksl <dig> protein binds lps with an affinity sufficient enough to sequester a large fraction of the internalized lps or intracellular gram-negative bacteria within the endosome/phagosome.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that s. typhimurium and lps in particular represent one of the most potent activators of signaling pathways of momΦ and modc leading to a similar response in both cell types. despite the similarity of the responses, compared to modc, the momΦ were more pro-inflammatory. this difference was less obvious in response to lps and more obvious in response to s. typhimurium. our results showed that increased pro-inflammatory signaling by momΦ compared to modc might be, at least in some subsets of mononuclear phagocytes, associated with differential marcksl <dig> protein expression though the exact role of these proteins in differential responsiveness of momΦ and modc to s. typhimurium infection remains to be determined.
