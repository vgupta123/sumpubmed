BACKGROUND
real-time quantitative pcr  has become a very powerful tool for gene expression studies. one of the main difficulties associated with this highly sensitive technique is the necessity of accurate normalization, to account for varying amounts of cdna input. this variation is inherent to the multistep process required to extract and process the rna. the use of internal controls or reference genes has become the method of choice to account for this source of variation. the choice of an appropriate internal standard is therefore critical for relative gene expression analysis in order to obtain consistent and reliable results, especially when measuring small expression differences. a suitable reference gene to which expression can be normalized should have constant expression in all samples under investigation and should be insensitive to varying experimental treatments.

although the nematode c. elegans is a commonly used model organism that has proven its importance in the unraveling of many important signaling pathways, to date no comprehensive analysis has been performed to validate candidate reference genes for gene expression analysis. therefore, commonly used reference genes such as act- <dig> and ama- <dig> are often used without validating their usefulness. however, several reports indicate that the expression of commonly used reference genes can vary under different experimental conditions  <cit> , possibly leading to dramatic misinterpretation of the expression level of a target gene. although there is no universally accepted approach for data normalization, the method of using multiple stably expressed reference genes is currently the golden standard  <cit> . the straightforward method developed by vandesompele and colleagues  <cit>  to identify the most stably expressed reference genes from a set of candidate control genes can be used to normalize gene expression levels . their method also allows the determination of the optimal number of genes required for reliable normalization of qpcr generated gene expression data. they advocate use of the geometric mean of multiple stably expressed reference genes for normalization of relative quantities. this approach has been widely implemented by many researchers and has been statistically validated by szabo et al.  <cit>  and by the bootstrap procedure of gabrielsson et al.  <cit> , but surprisingly seems to be neglected in the c. elegans research field.

the ins/igf- <dig> signaling  pathway is a well-known life span regulator in c. elegans, drosophila and mice  <cit> . a reduced activity of the pathway in c. elegans leads to nuclear localization of the transcription factor daf- <dig>  causing dauer formation and extended adult life span. long-lived iis mutants are highly resistant to a wide diversity of stressors, including enhanced survival upon exposure to the superoxide generator paraquat  <cit> . given the potential role of reactive oxygen species in the ageing process, it is assumed that enzymes involved in the breakdown of ros play an important role in the longevity phenotype of dauers and long-lived iis mutants. five different genes encoding superoxide dismutase  have been predicted in c. elegans. sod- <dig> and sod- <dig> encode cytosolic cuznsods. sod- <dig> expresses two splice variants, one membrane bound and one secreted. sod- <dig> and sod- <dig> encode mitochondrial mnsods. it is well-established that increased life span is often associated with increased stress resistance and high antioxidant activity. for example, the long life span of dauers and iis mutants is associated with increased stress resistance and high sod activity  <cit> . northern blot and microarray analysis have shown that sod- <dig> and possibly also sod- <dig> are upregulated in dauers and daf- <dig> mutants  <cit> .

we demonstrate the usefulness of genorm to determine the expression levels of the sod genes in c. elegans. genorm analysis evaluates the stability of candidate reference genes based on the mean pairwise variation of a gene with all other tested genes. we compared the expression level of the candidate reference genes in  <dig> different c. elegans samples to validate internal controls for the analysis of sod gene expression. the presented approach can be applied to accurately normalize the expression of any c. elegans gene of interest.

RESULTS
we carefully selected  <dig> potential reference genes from different functional classes to minimize the chance of coregulation using two different approaches . first we selected commonly used reference genes such as ama- <dig> , act- <dig> , eif- <dig> c , gpd- <dig>  and tba- <dig> . in a second approach we screened publicly available c. elegans microarray expression data  <cit> . in this procedure we ranked all genes according to their standard deviation in  <dig> experiments and chose potential reference genes within the top ranked ones based on the following three criteria:  functional description available,  expression data available for at least  <dig> experiments and  cdna confirmed . this strategy resulted in cdc- <dig>  pmp- <dig>  rgs- <dig>  unc- <dig> and y45f10d. <dig> as candidate reference genes. after initial screening, we found that two genes  from the available expression data in kim et al.  <cit>  were expressed at very low levels and therefore excluded for further analysis.

in an attempt to validate the remaining  <dig> candidate reference genes as internal control for analysis of sod gene expression in c. elegans, we set up an experiment containing young adult wild-type , three strains carrying mutations in the ins/igf pathway , wild type dauer worms and wild-type l <dig> stage larvae. data were collected using rna from  <dig> replicate c. elegans cultures.

since the reverse transcription step is the source of most of the variability in quantitative pcr  <cit> , cdna synthesis was performed in duplicate from each of the three different biological replicates and pooled to use as template in the pcr experiments. for every primer pair concentrations were optimized in a range between  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, based on a standard curve made with dilution series of a mixture of all cdna templates. these standard curves produced efficiencies between  <dig>  and  <dig>   with standard deviations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and correlation coefficients greater than  <dig> , as determined by qbase  <cit> . three identical real-time qpcr experiments were performed. in each experiment, the expression levels of the candidate reference genes and sod genes were measured in duplicate in  <dig> different worm samples. the candidate control genes display a wide expression range with mean cycle threshold  values between  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

to identify the most stable reference genes we applied the genorm program. the ranking of the candidate reference genes according to their stability measure value  in every biological replicate is displayed in table  <dig>  this gene expression stability measure m is the mean pairwise variation between a candidate reference gene and all other tested candidates. a higher value of m means greater variation in expression. the stepwise elimination of genes with the highest m values allows the ranking of the tested genes according to their expression stability. interestingly, in the three biological repeat experiments cdc- <dig> and pmp- <dig> turned out to be among the three best performing reference genes. moreover, in each of the three biological repeats the ranking of the least stable genes included mdh- <dig>  act- <dig> and gpd- <dig>  the consistent ranking of the best and worst reference genes illustrates the excellent correspondence and reproducibility between the  <dig> independently grown nematode cultures. pairwise variations vn/n+ <dig> between each combination of sequential normalization factors  were calculated by genorm to determine the optimal number of reference genes required for accurate normalization. based on the recommendations by vandesompele et al.  <cit>  we used a cut-off value of  <dig> , below which the inclusion of an additional reference gene does not result in a significant improvement of normalization . following this criterion the inclusion of a third reference gene is required for assay set  <dig>  but not for analyzing replicate sets  <dig> and  <dig> . for consistency reasons we prefer to use the  <dig> most stably expressed genes for all  <dig> replicate assays .

to demonstrate the need for accurate relative quantification using suitable reference genes, the expression of the sod genes was studied. in each of the three assays a normalization factor based on the geometric mean of cdc- <dig>  pmp- <dig> and y45f10d. <dig> expression level was used to determine the relative expression level of all  <dig> sod genes. the average normalised sod mrna values and the 95% confidence intervals are shown in figure  <dig>  the 95% confidence intervals clearly illustrate that sod- <dig> and sod- <dig> are significantly upregulated in daf- <dig> relative to n <dig>  in agreement with microarray studies of mcelwee et al.  <cit>  and murphy et al.  <cit> . in dauers, sod- <dig> is significantly downregulated relative to l <dig>  sod- <dig> is significantly upregulated relative to l <dig>  and sod- <dig> and sod- <dig> are significantly upregulated relative to both l <dig> and n <dig> 

we illustrate that normalization to a single reference gene without appropriate validation can lead to erroneous results by normalizing sod- <dig> to act- <dig>  gpd- <dig> and mdh- <dig>  respectively. when normalized only to act- <dig> the expression level of sod- <dig> in daf- <dig> differs by more than  <dig> % and is not found to be significantly upregulated. moreover the expression level of sod- <dig> in the dauer is upregulated instead of downregulated relative to l <dig>  this shows that act- <dig> is unsuitable as a reference gene. when using mdh- <dig>  only a modest, but not significant, increase by 2-fold in daf- <dig> could be seen, and the expression level of sod- <dig> appears to be strongly upregulated in dauers. moreover, if gpd- <dig> or ama- <dig> had been used, no significant differential expression would have been detected in daf- <dig> mutants or dauers.

discussion
an ideal reference gene is expressed at the same level in all cell types and under all experimental conditions. numerous publications demonstrate that no single gene is able to fulfill these criteria. to reliably measure small expression differences, normalization using  stably expressed reference genes is of crucial importance. this forced us to undertake a comprehensive analysis of different potential reference genes in  <dig> different c. elegans samples, including distinct developmental stages of the wild-type and adults of ins/igf pathway mutants.

we here provide validated assays for a newly developed set of multiple candidate reference genes.

the genorm analysis revealed that cdc- <dig> and pmp- <dig> are among the  <dig> best performing reference genes identified in each of  <dig> biological replicates. they were picked up from a microarray screen of differentially regulated genes  underscoring the reliability of this strategy to identify new candidate reference genes. they are far more stably expressed than conventional reference genes, at least in this study. since in all  <dig> biological repeats addition of a fourth reference gene did not substantially improve the newly calculated normalization factor, there was no need to include more reference genes. therefore we recommend to use three reference genes since we generally found that this number allows reliable and accurate quantification with a minimal effort.

our analysis showed that mdh- <dig> is the least stable reference gene, which is in concordance with a previously published paper of mcelwee et al.  <cit>  who demonstrated by microarray analysis that mdh- <dig> was downregulated in dauers. similarly, mendenhall et al.  <cit>  have recently shown that gpd- <dig> was upregulated in daf- <dig> worms. both studies suggest that gpd- <dig> and mdh- <dig> are downstream genes of daf- <dig>  as expected, genorm ranked these genes as the two least stable reference genes in two of the three biological repeats. interestingly, the most commonly used reference gene act- <dig> is one of the least stable reference genes as indicated by the genorm analysis.

we used the reference genes to reveal the expression levels of sod-genes in long-lived ins/igf mutants and dauers. our results largely confirm and extend previous studies using norhern blots, sage and microarray analysis. the increased expression of sod- <dig> in dauers and daf- <dig> mutants has been well documented  <cit> ,  <cit> . elevated expression of sod- <dig> in dauers was reported by jones et al.  <cit> . we also detected an increased expression of sod- <dig> in daf- <dig> mutants which is in accordance with the increased activity of cytosolic sod in long-lived ins/igf- <dig> pathway mutants  <cit>  given that sod- <dig> appears to be the most active cuznsod  <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the importance of appropriate validation of internal reference genes chosen for gene expression analysis using real-time qpcr. we show that candidate reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression levels in c. elegans can be identified from publicly available microarray databases. the methodology used in the present study enables accurate analysis of differential gene expression of any set of candidate genes.
