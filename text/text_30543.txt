BACKGROUND
genetic transformation is an important tool for crop improvement and research in genetics. the transformation of bioenergy crops with genes that alter plant development rate, growth habit, cell wall structure and/or composition has been deemed a promising approach to reduce cell wall recalcitrance  or to increase biomass yields  <cit> . switchgrass , a c <dig> perennial grass species native to the prairies of north america, is a candidate lignocellulosic feedstock for bioenergy  <cit> . the development of tissue culture and transformation systems has led to significant breakthroughs and applications in switchgrass biotechnology  <cit> . recent increases in transformation efficiency  <cit> , along with recent demonstrations of transgenic modifications  <cit> , suggest that genetic improvements of switchgrass through transgene expression and down-regulation of native genes will be accomplished with increasing regularity in the coming years.

transformation of switchgrass and other monocots is facilitated by reliable molecular tools, including improved promoters for transgene expression. a variety of promoters used in monocot plant species have been reported in the literature, such as the rice  actin  <dig>  and actin  <dig>  promoters  <cit> , the maize ubiquitin  <dig>  promoter  <cit> , and multiple rice ubiquitin  promoters  <cit> . however, relatively few promoters have been used in the production of transgenic switchgrass. richards et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the osact1and zmubi <dig> promoters are able to drive transgene expression in switchgrass, and these promoters have been used in subsequent switchgrass transformation studies  <cit> . while the cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter has been used in switchgrass, it typically resulted in lower levels of expression  <cit> . somleva et al.  <cit>  used the rice ubiquitin  <dig>  promoter with limited success, whereas the cab-m <dig> light-inducible promoter from the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein in maize fused to the heat shock protein  <dig>  intron resulted in significantly higher levels of transgene expression. however, cab-m <dig> expression is only expressed in a limited number of plant tissues and cell types  <cit> . most recently, the rubi <dig> promoter was used to drive sgfp expression in switchgrass callus, stem, axillary bud and anther tissues  <cit> . discovery and characterization of new promoters with enhanced levels of constitutive expression are needed  <cit> , and would be highly beneficial to improve bioenergy feedstock crops through genetic transformation. while tissue-specific and inducible promoters are desirable for certain applications  <cit> , constitutively expressed promoters are still the most commonly used promoters in transgenic plants and are advantageous for their wide range and stable levels of transgene expression.

ubiquitin is a protein that consists of tandem repeats of a  <dig> amino acid monomer and is among the most conserved proteins in eukaryotes; only three amino acid polymorphisms exist among sequences from higher plant and animal species  <cit> . ubiquitin is present in all eukaryotic cells. therefore, the promoters from polyubiquitin genes are good candidates to regulate the constitutive expression of transgenes. polyubiquitin gene promoters have been isolated from a variety of plants and tested for their ability to drive transgene expression, including from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , sunflower   <cit> , parsley   <cit> , tobacco   <cit> , potato   <cit> , tomato   <cit> , sugarcane   <cit> , gladiolus sp.  <cit> , soybean   <cit>  and lotus japonicus  <cit>  as well as the rice and maize polyubiquitin genes mentioned above. in contrast with the highly conserved nature of the protein-encoding portions of polyubiquitin genes, their promoters and introns have extensive sequence variability between paralogs and across organisms. however, all the polyubiquitin genes isolated from monocot and dicot plant species share similar structures, including a 5' utr intron that significantly contributes to the strong expression capabilities of the polyubiquitin promoters  <cit> .

in this study, we identified two novel polyubiquitin gene sequences  from a switchgrass genomic library and characterized the native expression patterns of these genes. additionally, reporter constructs were assembled containing the isolated 5' upstream regulatory regions of the coding sequences  of these genes fused to the uida coding region . these constructs were tested for transient and stable expression in a variety of plant species and tissues. our results demonstrate the potential use of the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters in driving transgene expression in switchgrass, rice and tobacco. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing native switchgrass promoter sequences for transgene expression.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of pvubi <dig> and pvubi2
two polyubiquitin genes were cloned from a switchgrass fosmid library constructed by j. hawkins and r. percifield . these two genes were designated as ubiquitin  <dig>  and  <dig>  and are closely linked to each other within the genome . pvubi <dig> consists of  <dig> bp containing cis-acting regulatory elements, a 5' untranslated region  containing a  <dig> bp non-coding exon and a  <dig> bp intron, a  <dig> bp open reading frame  and a  <dig> bp 3' utr. pvubi <dig> consists of  <dig> bp containing cis-acting regulatory elements, a  <dig> bp 5' utr, a  <dig> bp intron, a  <dig> bp orf and a  <dig> bp 3' utr. for pvubi <dig>  the  <dig> bp orf encodes four tandem, head-to-tail repeats of  <dig> bp, commonly referred to as ubiquitin monomer repeats, with minimal sequence variation from one repeat to another. similar results were found from sequence analysis of pvubi <dig>  however, instead of four repeats, the orf contained five tandem head-to-tail repeats resulting in a coding region of  <dig> bp. the ubiquitin monomers of pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> contained identical amino acid sequences compared to each other and several other plant species, including maize  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . to test for promoter activity, the promoter candidate region of pvubi <dig> that spans  <dig> bp of the 5' region upstream from the transcriptional initiation site, along with the  <dig> bp 5' utr non-coding exon and the  <dig> bp 5' utr intron was cloned, resulting in a fragment of a total of  <dig> bp. for pvubi <dig>  the isolated candidate promoter region was  <dig> bp, including  <dig> bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site, the 5' utr exon  and the  <dig> bp 5' utr intron .

by analysis of the genomic dna in the selected promoter region, introns were identified immediately upstream of the atg start codon in the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> genes. these introns were identified based on the consensus sequences caag/gtac at the 5' splice site and cag/atg at the 3' splice site , which are identical for characterized polyubiquitin genes from plants  <cit> . to validate these intron splice sites and identify the transcriptional initiation site, switchgrass mrna was subjected to race-pcr with primers specific for pvubi <dig> or pvubi <dig>  for pvubi <dig>  results revealed a transcriptional initiation site at an adenine located  <dig> bases upstream from the atg translational initiation codon of the polyubiquitin gene. subsequently, the transcriptional initiation site for pvubi <dig> was identified at an adenine  <dig> bp upstream from the translational initiation codon of the polyubiquitin gene. using cdna clones from the race-pcr, along with expressed sequence tags  from genbank and tobias et al.  <cit> , the intron splice sites were confirmed, revealing  <dig> and  <dig> bp introns present in pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig>  respectively. the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> introns exhibited limited homology , similar to the level of identity that has been reported when comparing different rice ubiquitin introns  <cit> .

the plantcare database  <cit>  was queried for putative cis-element sequences within the candidate promoter regions of pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig>  several motifs of putative functionality were identified for pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> . for pvubi <dig>  these consisted of motifs involved in anaerobic induction , light-responsiveness ccc, positions - <dig> to 216; - <dig> to -165; and - <dig> to -49), response to methyl jasmonate  , low-temperature responsiveness , endosperm expression , a myb transcription factor binding site involved in drought-inducibility , three caat boxes  and a tata box . for pvubi <dig>  the identified motifs for putative cis-acting regulatory elements were those involved in meristem expression  and meristem specific activation , anoxic-specific inducibility , low-temperature responsiveness , endosperm expression , light responsiveness ccc), two caat boxes and a tata box . however, it is important to indicate that these elements were determined from in silico data and remain to be functionally validated.

tissue expression profiles of pvubi <dig> and pvubi2
a survey of switchgrass ests from the genbank and tobias et al.  <cit>  databases revealed expression of pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> in all examined tissue types and growth stages: leaf, root, apex and stem, crown, callus, early floral buds and reproductive tissue, late flowering buds and seed development, and etiolated seedlings. to confirm these in silico data, specific primers were designed for pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> to perform quantitative reverse transcriptase-pcr  in different switchgrass tissues . the qrt-pcr results confirm that both pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> are expressed in all tissues tested . pvubi <dig> showed higher levels of expression in all tissues except stem when compared to pvubi <dig> 

transient and stable gus expression regulated by the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters
the capabilities of the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoter candidate regions to drive transgene expression were evaluated through the construction of expression vectors . all promoter variants were cloned upstream of the uida coding region  to create promoter-gus fusions. vector constructs were transformed into switchgrass callus by particle bombardment, and transient expression was observed by gus histochemical staining. all constructs showed gus expression, verifying that the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters can be used successfully to drive transgene expression. in order to compare expression levels of the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters with those of other promoters, several plant promoters commonly used in monocot transformation were selected and cloned into the same identical vector  to eliminate any discrepancies in expression levels as a result of vector backbone or vector size .

in switchgrass and rice, the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters resulted in higher levels of gus compared to the camv 35s and 2x35s promoters . in switchgrass, the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters drove significantly higher gus expression when compared side-by-side with all other plant promoters , with the pvubi <dig> promoter reaching  <dig> -fold higher levels than camv 35s . in rice, the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters resulted in  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher levels of expression when compared to camv 35s, respectively . no enhancement of gus activity was observed when three and nine amino acids of the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> ubiquitin coding regions were fused to their respective promoters . when comparing promoter expression levels between switchgrass and rice, the relative difference in absolute gene expression was  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold higher for rice. to further validate these transient assays, rice callus was bombarded with promoter- phlucgwgus constructs and selected for stable transformation. when transgenic plants were grown to maturity, the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters produced gus in leaves, stems and roots of mature rice plants, while no gus was detected in the untransformed control .

the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoter constructs were stably transformed into tobacco  to evaluate expression levels of these promoters in a dicot expression system. additional promoter variants containing three or nine amino acid fusions downstream of the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> intron sequences were tested for the potential of increased transgene expression. stably transformed t <dig> plants were randomly selected and grown to obtain seed for generation of t <dig> progeny. gus from the pvubi <dig>  pvubi1+ <dig> and pvubi1+ <dig> promoter constructs could not be visually observed in t <dig> seedlings at  <dig> and  <dig> days after germination, so these promoter variants were not studied in subsequent experiments . while the pvubi <dig> promoter drove gus expression in leaves, stems and roots at  <dig> and  <dig> days, the levels of expression were minimal when compared to 2x35s . however, the gus expression dramatically increased with the pvubi <dig> promoters containing an additional three and nine amino acid fusions from the ubiquitin coding region , exhibiting visibly detectable levels of gus activity in the vascular tissue of leaves, stems, and roots. there was no visible enhancement of gus from the pvubi <dig> promoter constructs in tobacco following heat shock induction treatment for  <dig> minutes at 42°c. however, heat shock induction was not experimentally tested within the native pvubi <dig> or pvubi <dig> genes in switchgrass.

since the pvubi <dig> promoters showed expression in seedlings, plants containing these promoter constructs were grown to maturity for further analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  adult t <dig> plants showed staining of gus in the pollen, pistil and leaves for the pvubi <dig> promoter variants . similar to the data from young seedlings, the pvubi2+ <dig> and pvubi2+ <dig> promoters containing fusions showed the highest levels of expression. expression of gus in mature leaves under the control of pvubi <dig> promoter variants appeared to be specific to the vascular tissue. gus expression driven by the pvubi2+ <dig> and pvubi2+ <dig> promoters in mature t <dig> plants was observed to be lower than those in seedlings. gus staining was consistently higher for the 2x35s promoter in both tobacco seedlings and mature adult t <dig> plants.

discussion
this study demonstrates the isolation and characterization of two switchgrass polyubiquitin genes, pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig>  the identical amino acid sequences of the ubiquitin monomer repeats in pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> further reveal the highly conserved nature of the polyubiquitin gene family across both monocot and dicot genes  <cit> . both pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> displayed high levels of native expression in all tissue types analyzed, consistent with the broad function of ubiquitin in cell-cycle regulation  <cit> , dna-repair  <cit>  and other processes required of all cell types  <cit> . additional sequence data  suggest that more than one copy of polyubiquitin genes could exist in switchgrass containing 5' and 3' utr regions identical to that of pvubi <dig>  these data are not unique to this study, as similar observations have been made in sugarcane, where 5' and 3' utr sequences were identical for two individually isolated clones, while the number of ubiquitin monomer coding repeats varied  <cit> . whether these findings are the results of different polyubiquitin genes present in the switchgrass genome or of post-transcriptional splicing and modification remains to be determined. in either case, the presence of multiple genes is consistent with the polyploidy nature of these species.

intron-mediated enhancement of gene expression has been shown in a number of plant species  <cit> , and multiple ubiquitin promoters have shown enhanced transgene expression when the intron is included in the promoter region  <cit> . therefore, the intron regions  were retained with their respective 5' upstream promoter candidate regions during vector construction. however, the regulatory elements of some monocot promoters retain high expression despite large deletions in the internal portions of the intron sequence, as long as efficient intron splicing is retained  <cit> . therefore, future deletion analysis for the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoter candidate regions could yield beneficial results, since the removal of internal ubiquitin intron sequences may have no detrimental effect  <cit> .

the fusion of ubiquitin monomers to the n terminus of expressed proteins has been observed to lead to site-specific and highly efficient cleavage, resulting in free ubiquitin and free protein of interest in the cell  <cit> . these fusions are not only efficiently processed and cleaved by ubiquitin-specific proteases, but can also result in enhanced gene expression and protein accumulation  <cit> . ubiquitin fusions have been applied for higher production of therapeutic recombinant proteins  <cit> . additionally, plant vectors have been developed that employ ubiquitin fusions for the coexpression and cleaving of two proteins from a single transcript  <cit> . this approach has also been used for the enhancement of ubiquitin promoters in regulating transgene expression by the addition of an entire ubiquitin monomer or select amino acids from the n terminus of the polyubiquitin coding region downstream of the promoter region  <cit> . in this study, comparative expression levels of the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoter candidate regions and their three  or nine  amino acid ubiquitin fusion promoter variants revealed minimal changes in levels of gus expression for switchgrass and rice. however, the three and nine amino acid fusions of the polyubiquitin coding region to the pvubi <dig> promoter and intron drastically increased gus staining in the vascular tissue of tobacco. while an additive effect has been observed when the first three or nine amino acids of the polyubiquitin coding region are fused to the n-terminus of a transgene and coupled with a ubiquitin promoter  <cit> , these enhancing effects were later attributed to the removal of a gus 5' untranslated leader sequence  <cit> . therefore, the enhancing effect of these fusions in tobacco is striking, since the majority of ubiquitin fusion enhancements have been demonstrated fusing an entire ubiquitin monomer to the transgene  <cit> . fusion of the entire ubiquitin monomer was not tested in this study, but the high levels of expression in switchgrass and rice using the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters and introns without the ubiquitin monomer fusions demonstrates that these promoter and intron regions alone are highly useful for plant biotechnology applications in monocots. likewise, the pvubi2+ <dig> and pvubi2+ <dig> promoter variants could be useful for tissue-specific applications in tobacco and other dicots.

data from transient biolistic bombardment assays can be highly variable in nature. therefore, the rice and switchgrass transient expression assays were repeated in six independent replicates to increase the reliability of the resulting data. in addition, the phlucgwgus vector used in these experiments contained the zmubi <dig> promoter and the firefly luciferase coding sequence  in the vector backbone as an internal control to further improve the reliability and reproducibility of these transient expression data, as previously reported  <cit> . the methodology used for the bombardment assay in switchgrass and rice is the first plant transformation study of promoter expression using an internal luc cassette control within the same vector backbone as the experimental promoter-gus fusion cassette, as opposed to the standard use of co-transformation  <cit> .

the promoter-gus fusions were observed to produce high levels of transgene expression in both switchgrass and rice. the comparisons of the expression levels of promoters pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> to other promoters are worth noting, since the camv 35s and zmubi <dig> promoters are the two most commonly used in monocot transformation. the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters showed levels of expression higher than or equal to those of the zmubi <dig> and camv 35s promoters. the pvubi <dig> promoter should be the most effective for driving expression of transgenes in switchgrass; promoter pvubi <dig> resulted in significantly higher expression levels than zmubi <dig> and camv 35s. in rice, the differences were even more striking, with the pvubi <dig> promoter resulting in expression levels  <dig> -fold higher than that of camv 35s, the most commonly used promoter in this species. the levels of gene expression detected in rice for the zmubi <dig>  osact <dig> and camv 35s promoters in this study reflect previous findings of high gene expression levels in maize  <cit> . the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters resulted in higher transgene expression in rice than in switchgrass, demonstrating the flexibility of these promoters in a monocot species other than switchgrass, and the potential for similar results in other monocots as well. the stable expression of gus driven by pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters in rice leaves, stems and roots also demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of these promoters in mature plants. these data suggest that the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters should be very effective for driving constitutive transgene expression in switchgrass, rice and potentially other monocots.

while expression of the pvubi <dig> promoter was not observed in tobacco, the tissue-specific regulation of the pvubi <dig> promoter and fusion variants could make these promoters advantageous for some applications that require expression limited to vascular or reproductive tissues. the decrease of gus expression in adult leaf tissue is consistent with the findings that ubiquitin levels are higher in younger plant tissues  <cit> , although conflicting observations have been made with other ubiquitin promoters  <cit> . when the pvubi <dig> promoter variants were tested for heat shock-induced transgene expression in tobacco, there was no effect observed on the level of gus expression. however, it is worth noting that the ubq1- <dig> promoter from tomato exhibited increased native transcript levels under heat shock conditions, but once fused to the gus gene and stably expressed in tobacco, exhibited no response to heat shock induction  <cit> , suggesting that the heat shock of ubiquitin promoters can yield different results when compared between native species and transgenic plant expression. in contrast, heat shock induction of the zmubi <dig> promoter resulted in increased expression levels in native maize tissue as well as transgenic rice callus and protoplasts  <cit> , and sugarcane  <cit> . however, heat shock has been reported to have a variety of effects on polyubiquitin promoters including up-regulation  <cit> , down-regulation  <cit>  and no change  <cit> . the heat shock element consensus sequence  reported by pelham  <cit>  was not found in the promoter regions of pvubi <dig> or pvubi <dig>  and no heat shock elements were identified from the plantcare database queries  <cit> . however, the numerous putative cis-acting regulatory elements identified in the promoter regions of pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> could be functionally validated in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
because ubiquitin is a necessary component of all eukaryotic cells, polyubiquitin genes are prime candidates for the isolation of highly expressed constitutive promoters. we identified and characterized promoters from two polyubiquitin genes  in switchgrass. experiments using these promoters resulted in high levels of expression in switchgrass and rice that equaled or surpassed all of the commonly used plant promoters tested in this study . in addition, stable transformation of tobacco with the pvubi2+ <dig> and pvubi2+ <dig> promoter fusion variants showed expression in seedlings as well as the leaves, pistils and pollen of mature plants. these data suggest that the pvubi <dig> and pvubi <dig> promoters are valuable for genetic transformation studies and demonstrate the potential broad versatility of these promoters in monocot and dicot species.
