BACKGROUND
macrophages are key cells of innate immunity to different mycobacterial infections, including human and bovine tuberculosis caused predominantly by mycobacterium tuberculosis  and mycobacterium bovis , respectively. the functions of mΦ after infection with mycobacteria are strictly dependent on the activation phenotype, which is determined by bacteria- induced signaling through the pattern-recognition receptors , leading to innate mΦ activation, and is also regulated by a variety of signals from the surrounding microenvironment. the most important of these signals are cytokines produced by activated lymphocytes and other cells.

macrophages primed with th <dig> cytokine  polarize to proinflammatory m <dig> cells, readily increasing the level of activation in the presence of microbial ligands, and developing the phenotype typical of classically activated macrophages, cam  <cit> . these cells produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and generate reactive oxygen  and nitrogen  intermediates which enhance bactericidal and cytotoxic mΦ functions. in contrast, macrophages activated with th <dig> cytokines , exposed to immune complexes in combination with tlr ligands, or il- <dig>  polarize to distinct m <dig> phenotypes, m2a, m2b and m2c, respectively, associated with alternatively activated macrophages , which display anti-inflammatory and tissue repair activities  <cit> . the m <dig> macrophages are characterized by expression of typical markers, including increased arginase  <dig>  expression and activity, increased expression of scavenger and mannose  receptors, and production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine , which is more pronounced in the aam induced by exogenic il- <dig>  the mΦ primed by il- <dig> were demonstrated to secrete none, or very low levels, of proinflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial lps, but produce anti-inflammatory il- <dig> and tgf-β, that prompted gordon to term this m <dig> state the ‘innate/acquired inactivation’  <cit>  and include these cells to group of ‘regulatory’ mf  <cit> . the cytokines produced by th <dig> and th <dig> cells or il- <dig> induce extreme phenotypes of mΦ activation characterized by distinct markers. after infection, microbial products can modulate mΦ activation through prr-dependent signaling, providing a wide range of mΦ phenotypes between the two extremes  <cit> .

during acute inflammatory responses to mtb, macrophages are typically polarized to m <dig> under the effects of mycobacterial agonists for prrs and ifn-γ produced by th <dig>  and exert potent anti-microbial effects  <cit> . the transcriptomic analysis of responses of murine bone marrow- derived macrophages  to mtb and ifn-γ revealed an overlap of genes modulated by mycobacteria and ifn − γ, which corresponded to a m <dig> profile  <cit> . in contrast, pretreatment of the bmdm with il- <dig> resulted in the m <dig> transcriptional profile, and these cells presented delayed, and partially diminished, anti-mycobacterial responses  <cit> . these data were obtained employing the ‘laboratory’ mtb strain h37rv, widely used as a reference virulent strain for studies of tuberculosis pathogenesis. however, there is mounting evidence that strains of mtb and mbv circulating in human and animal populations are more genetically and functionally diverse than previously appreciated, demonstrating strain-dependent variation in virulence  <cit> . in the model of mΦ infection, highly virulent and epidemiologically successful strains of mtb were able to grow faster than the less virulent isolates  <cit> . the enhanced bacterial growth was observed not only in the intact murine mΦ, but also in those primed by ifn-γ  <cit> , suggesting, that at least some virulent strains of mtb were able to inhibit cam. additionally, highly virulent mtb were able to switch the initial th1-type reaction, associated with high levels of ifn-γ production in the infected mice, to potent treg cell response leading to production of il- <dig>  which reduced the bactericidal activities of mΦ  <cit> . in contrast to mtb, modulating effects of pathogenic mbv strains, differing in virulence-associated properties, on the mΦ activation phenotypes, determined by main regulating cytokines, ifn-γ and il- <dig>  have not been yet elucidated.

in this work, we studied the effects of pathogenic mbv isolates and reference mtb strain h37rv, differing in their ability to grow intracellularly in murine mΦ, on polarization of these cells to m <dig> and m <dig> phenotypes induced by the treatment with ifn-γ and il- <dig>  respectively. expression levels of typical m <dig> and m <dig> markers were evaluated. additionally, we verified intracellular signaling pathways that could regulate production of microbicidal rnis, through the modulation of inos and arg- <dig> expression.

our results demonstrated that the mbv strain mp287/ <dig>  characterized by increased intracellular survival and growth, in contrast to other strains, inhibited classical mΦ activation, switching the m <dig> activation profile of the cells, stimulated with ifn-γ, to a mixed m1/m <dig> phenotype. increased expression of arg- <dig>  observed in these cells, coincided with low levels of nitric oxide production, suggesting that reduced exposure of bacteria to nitrosative stress contributed to increased intracellular survival of these bacteria.

RESULTS
pathogenic isolates of m. bovis differed in their capacity to grow in the cultured macrophages
to investigate the mechanisms employed by pathogenic mbv to modulate mΦ activation, we selected for this study two clinical isolates of mbv which showed significant difference in capacity of bacteria to grow in mΦ. as shown in figure 1a, growth kinetics of one of the mbv isolates, strain b <dig>  was similar to that of the reference mtb strain h37rv. in contrast, the mbv strain mp287/ <dig> grew in mΦ significantly faster . after six days of incubation, an increase in the numbers of intracellular bacteria was 3-fold higher in cultures infected by the strain mp287/ <dig>  than those infected by strain b <dig>  in contrast to the intracellular growth, growth rate of the tested strains in specific middlebrook 7h <dig> media was similar, demonstrating that the intrinsic abilities of the different strains to replicate were similar . these data suggested that the observed differences in intracellular growth of these bacteria could be associated with differential resistance of the bacterial strains to microbicidal effects of mΦ.

the main cytokines regulating proinflammatory mΦ activity, ifn-γ  <cit>  and il- <dig>  <cit> , are known to increase or decrease the bactericidal functions of these cells, respectively. to verify whether intracellular survival of the different mycobacterial strains are equally regulated by the effects of ifn-γ and il- <dig> on mΦ, we tested intracellular growth rates of the studied bacterial strains in bmdm cultured in the presence of these cytokines. as shown in figure  <dig>  the treatment of macrophage cultures with recombinant il- <dig> had no significant effect on the growth of the studied strains. treatment with ifn-γ significantly reduced the growth rate of the strains b <dig> and h37rv, but this effect was less pronounced in the cell cultures infected with the strain mp287/ <dig>  these data demonstrated the resistance of rapidly growing strain  to the effects of ifn-γ, which is probably mediated by the ability of the mycobacteria to inhibit classic macrophage activation induced by this cytokine.

innate macrophage activation by the pathogenic mycobacterial strains differing in growth kinetics in macrophages
to study the effects of pathogenic mbv isolates on mΦ activation, we evaluated characteristic markers of m1- and m2- type macrophage polarization induced in infected bmdm, in the presence or absence of ifn-γ and il- <dig> 

first, we investigated the innate mΦ activation induced by infection. evaluation of expression of the m <dig> proinflammatory markers, including factors mediating recruitment of the phagocytic cells , and contributing to the mΦ microbicidity , demonstrated that the studied pathogenic mycobacterial strains induced different patterns of cytokine secretion by the bmdm . both clinical isolates of mbv induced less il- <dig> and mcp- <dig>  and, additionally, the mbv strain mp287/ <dig> induced less tnf-α, than the reference strain h37rv. in contrast, the level of secretion of mip- <dig>  an important chemokine regulating migration of granulocytes, was significantly increased in cultures infected with the mbv strains. these cells secreted 10-fold more mip- <dig> than the cells infected by h37rv strain, and 3-fold more than those infected by the strain b <dig>  neither mycobacterial strain tested in this study was able to induce in mΦ the production of no or il- <dig>  although production of these mediators was induced by the lps .

evaluation of the expression of typical m <dig> markers  by the infected cells demonstrated that neither strain induced production of the il- <dig> . in contrast, all the studied mycobacterial strains were able to induce expression of arg- <dig>  and the highest level was observed in the cells infected with the strain mp287/ <dig> . the expression of mr, which was constitutively high in the intact uninfected bmdm, was suppressed by treatment of the cells with lps, or infection with the less virulent h37rv and b <dig>  whereas the cells infected with the strain mp287/ <dig> continued to express high level of this receptor .

these data demonstrated that the proinflammatory activation of mΦ by clinical isolates of mbv, and particularly by the fast growing strain mp287/ <dig>  was significantly lower than that induced by the lps or reference mtb mycobacteria. additionally, the strain mp287/ <dig> induced in the mΦ a more pronounced expression of some m <dig> markers.

however, strong secretion of proinflammatory mip- <dig> chemokine observed in cell cultures infected by the strain mp287/ <dig> suggested that these bacteria induced in mΦ an atypical, mixed m1/m <dig> activation phenotype.

modulating effects of the pathogenic mycobacterial strains on the macrophage activation phenotypes induced by the cell treatment with ifn-γ and il-10
to study the mΦ activation phenotypes resulted from combining effects of bacteria and regulating cytokines, we evaluated expression of the markers of m <dig>  and m <dig> cells , by the pretreatment of infected bmdm with ifn-γ , and il- <dig> . the markers expressed by the infected cells, which were treated with the cytokines, were compared with those of the infected cells, which were left untreated. treatment with ifn-γ enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators in cultures infected by all the strains studied. however, the levels of secretion varied in a strain-dependent manner. macrophages infected by the mbv strains in the presence of ifn-γ  secreted significantly less tnf-α, il- <dig> and mcp- <dig>  than those infected by the h37rv strain. in contrast, production of mip- <dig> by the cells infected with mbv was significantly higher. as expected, treatment with ifn-γ induced in the infected mΦ, or those treated with lps, production of no , which is an important mediator of mΦ microbicidity, tightly regulated by the ifn-γ-dependent intracellular pathways. however, the cells infected with virulent mbv strain b <dig>  and particularly by the strain mp287/ <dig>  secreted significantly less no than those infected with the h37rv strain.

to verify whether signaling pathways leading to no production were differentially modulated by the mycobacterial strains, we evaluated induction of inos, the essential enzyme for the conversion of arginine to citrulline and no. the results obtained showed that treatment with ifn-γ induced inos expression in the cultured macrophages, and subsequent infection of these cells with bacteria enhanced the level of enzyme expression in a similar manner , demonstrating no strain-specific difference in the regulation of ifn-γ-dependent signaling which leads to transactivation of the inos gene.

evaluation of expression of m <dig> markers in the cells pretreated with ifn-γ demonstrated suppression of arg- <dig> expression induced by the strains b <dig> and h37rv, but not those infected with strain mp287/ <dig> . expression of mr by mΦ was slightly inhibited in the cell cultures treated with ifn-γ, and further reduced after infection of these cells with the strains b <dig> or h37rv. in contrast, infection with the strain mp287/ <dig> restored a high level of expression of this receptor , suggesting induction of mr gene transcription due to mycobacteria in these cells. neither bacterial strain was able to induce il- <dig> in the cells pretreated with the ifn-γ .

to verify the effects of mycobacterial infection on the il-10-induced m <dig> polarization, the cell cultures were treated with recombinant il- <dig>  this treatment induced in the bmdm expression of arg- <dig>  and secretion of il- <dig>  and mcp- <dig> . infection of these cells with the mycobacterial strains promoted expression of m <dig> markers, further increasing expression of the arg- <dig> and suppressing inhibition of the mr expression induced by the h37rv and b <dig> strains . the infected cultures continued to secrete low levels of il- <dig>  induced by the exogenic il- <dig> pretreatment . additionally, the treatment of mΦ with il- <dig> suppressed ability of some mycobacterial strains to induce increased levels of secretion of proinflammatory mediators. significant reduction of secretion of il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> by mΦ infected with the h37rv strain and mip- <dig> chemokine secretion, induced by the strains b <dig> and mp287/ <dig>  was observed .

these data show that the proinflammatory activities of mΦ induced by mycobacterial infection were significantly inhibited in the cells that were infected after priming by il- <dig>  these cells expressed mr and increased levels of arg- <dig>  which were particularly high in the cells infected with mp287/ <dig> strain. thus, the treatment with il- <dig> favored m2-type activation of the infected mΦ.

discussion
in this study, we aimed to investigate the modulating effects of pathogenic mbv strains, differing in virulence-associated properties, on activation phenotypes in mΦ treated with the main cytokines regulating proinflammatory mΦ activation: ifn-γ and il- <dig>  rapid growth of pathogenic mycobacteria in mΦ is one of the known factors contributing to bacterial virulence  <cit> . therefore, for this work, we selected two mbv isolates differing significantly in the capacity to grow in mΦ. one of these isolates, strain b <dig>  was capable of growing in bmdm at a rate similar to that of moderately virulent mtb strain h37rv, whereas the intracellular multiplication of other mbv strain  was significantly faster. additionally, we demonstrated that bacteria of mp287/ <dig> strain continued to grow rapidly in cells activated by ifn-γ, whereas the growth of the strains b <dig> and h37rv was significantly inhibited under this treatment. these data suggested that the mp287/ <dig> strain was either more resistant to the bactericidal effects of macrophages classically activated by ifn-γ, or were able to inhibit mΦ activation induced by this cytokine.

the modulating effects of the mbv strains were evaluated in comparison to those of the reference mtb strain h37rv, which was demonstrated in previous studies to induce in mΦ a proinflammatory activation and synergize with ifn-γ in induction of m1-type polarization of infected cells  <cit> . in accordance with these observations, our data demonstrated that the mtb strain h37rv induced m <dig> type activation of the infected bmdm, although the level of activation was less pronounced in comparison with that induced by lps. activation of mΦ by the mbv strains was even weaker than that induced by the h37rv strain. the lowest level of proinflammatory cytokine expression was observed in mΦ infected with the fast growing mbv strain mp287/ <dig>  although these cells produced high levels of mip- <dig> chemokine. additionally, these cells displayed increased levels of expression of m <dig> markers . thus, the mp287/ <dig> mycobacteria induced in mΦ an atypical, mixed m1/m <dig> activation phenotype that coincided with enhanced intracellular growth of the bacteria.

most important was observation, that this strain induced weaker production of the key bactericidal factors, such as tnf-α and no, even after pretreatment of mΦ with ifn-γ, priming these cells for m1-type activation. to study the mechanisms that could underlie the observed differences in rni production, we looked at intracellular signaling pathways leading to no production by the infected cells. the major regulators of no production are inos and arg - <dig>  competitive enzymes which utilize a common substrate  to produce no and citrulline, or urea and ornithine, respectively  <cit> . in previous study  <cit> , induction of arg- <dig> expression in mΦ by attenuated mbv strain bcg was found to be essential for reduction of no production, through the arginine substrate depletion mechanism, leading to promotion of the intracellular survival of these mycobacteria.

in this study, we demonstrated that pathogenic mbv were also able to induce expression of arg- <dig> in the infected mΦ. importantly, the fast growing strain mp287/ <dig> induced higher levels of the arg- <dig>  than any other studied strain, and strongly up-regulated expression of arg- <dig> in ifn-γ-treated cells. although all of the studied strains enhanced expression of inos, induced in cells by ifn-γ, in a similar manner, the increased level of arg- <dig> observed in mΦ infected with the mp287/ <dig> strain contributed to reduction of no secretion by these cells. these data suggested that highly virulent mbv, characterized by enhanced growth in mΦ could induce arg- <dig> as a component of the strategy to subvert the antimicrobial activity of cam, by hydrolyzing the substrate required for no production.

mechanisms leading to induction of arg- <dig> expression by mycobacteria are only recently starting to be elucidated. autocrine loop of secretion of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and g-csf, leading to phosphorylation of stat <dig> was determined as an essential mechanism for induction of arg- <dig> expression in bcg-infected mΦ  <cit> . however, in our study, the increased arg- <dig> expression induced by the strain mp287/ <dig>  coincided with low levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion by the infected mΦ. these data suggested that the signaling pathways, leading to the pronounced induction of the arg- <dig> by highly virulent mbv, could differ from those induced in the bcg-infected mΦ and should be investigated further in separate study.

another mechanism, underlying the reduced microbicidity of mΦ infected with the strain mp287/ <dig>  could be associated with capacity of these bacteria to induce in the cells expression of mr. infection with the strain h37rv and incubation with ifn-γ, synergistically inhibited expression of mr gene in murine bmdm  <cit> , constitutively expressing high levels of mr  <cit> , resembling in this manner, alveolar macrophages  <cit> . in line with these observations, infection of the cells pretreated with ifn-γ by the moderately virulent strains, h37rv and b <dig>  in our experiments resulted in down-regulation of mr expression. in contrast to these strains, infection of mΦ by the strain mp287/ <dig> restored expression of mr reduced by the ifn-γ treatment. high and persistent levels of mr expression in the mΦ infected with strain mp287/ <dig> in the presence or absence of ifn-γ suggested that these cells could be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of mannosyl-capped lipoarabinomannan  expressed by the pathogenic mycobacteria. interaction of man-lam with mr has been demonstrated to inhibit fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes in the infected mΦ, interfere with ifn-γ-mediated signaling in mΦ activation, as well as suppress tlr-dependent induction of expression of il- <dig> and other proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . in line with this suggestion, the infected cells expressing higher levels of mr in our experiments were permissive to enhanced intracellular growth even in the presence of ifn-γ.

the ability of the strain mp287/ <dig> to induce in mΦ some properties of the m <dig> cells, suggested that infection of the mΦ, pretreated with il- <dig>  by these bacteria may synergize in il-10- dependent m <dig> polarization of these cells. the obtained results demonstrated that the treatment with il- <dig> led to reduction of the proinflammatory mΦ activation by the studied mycobacterial strains. these cells displayed increased expression of the m <dig> markers, mr, il- <dig> and arg- <dig>  the highest levels of arg- <dig> were observed in the cells infected by mp287/ <dig> mycobacteria, demonstrating that the treatment with il- <dig> favored the m2-type activation of these cells.

although the cells infected with mp287/ <dig> strain displayed increased levels of the m <dig> markers in the presence or absence of regulating cytokines, these cells secreted high levels of the proinflammatory mip- <dig> chemokine. in contrast to the mcp- <dig> chemokine, regulating monocyte recruitment which is essential for formation of functional granuloma, the continues production of mip- <dig>  and other chemokines attracting granulocytes, was demonstrated to cause excessive recruitment of neutrophils to the infected lungs, contributing to tissue damage in pulmonary tuberculosis, reviewed by  <cit> . the high level of mip- <dig> secretion and inappropriate proinflammatory mΦ activation, observed in the bmdm cultures infected with mp287/ <dig> strain in this study, may have aggravating implications for in vivo infection with these, fast-replicating intracellular bacteria. verification of this important issue is currently under investigation in our laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
the data obtained in this study show that the pathogenic mbv strains differed in their capacity to modulate the m1-type activation phenotype induced by ifn-γ. in contrast to the mycobacterial strains demonstrating moderate ability to grow intracellularly which enhanced classical activation of mΦ by inf-γ, the fast growing strain of mbv induced an atypical, mixed m1/m <dig> phenotype, leading to inhibition of mΦ bactericidal activity. these data demonstrate functional diversity of mbv strains circulating in animal population, highlighting novel strategies of intracellular adaptation of the pathogenic mycobacteria. elucidating the functional significance of diversity of virulence-associated properties of mbv is important for understanding the diverse outcomes of infection and mechanisms of pathogenesis of bovine tuberculosis.
