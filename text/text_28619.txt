BACKGROUND
non-coding rnas , particularly those transcribed from genomic regions spanning introns of spliced genes, have been proposed as a fundamental advance in the genetic operating system of higher organisms by influencing the genomic program of differentiation and development in individuals and species  <cit> . many functions, such as transcriptional or translational regulation, rna splicing, gene silencing, imprinting and dosage compensation, have been assigned to mammalian ncrnas  <cit> . most functionally characterized ncrnas belong to classes of small rnas such as micrornas  <cit>  and small nucleolar rnas   <cit> . while several novel long ncrnas have been described in mammalian organisms  <cit>  few have been characterized in more detail, the ~ <dig> kb xist rna involved in inactivation of chromosome x being an exception  <cit> .

recent studies based on computational analysis and experimental validation have revealed that both introns and intergenic regions constitute major sources of ncrnas  <cit> . extensive analyses of the human expressed sequence tags  database have focused particularly on spliced mrnas, and ests that overlap at least one exon have identified an abundant number of sense-antisense transcript pairs in humans  <cit> , mice  <cit>  and plants  <cit> , pointing to a well-conserved mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.

recently, micrornas have been shown to be consistently altered in normal and tumor cells, allowing the identification of tissue-specific expression signatures  <cit> . using a custom-built cdna microarray enriched in ests corresponding to fragments of intronic transcripts, we previously detected transcription of a set of totally intronic ncrnas, which are long , unspliced, and oriented in the antisense direction relative to the corresponding protein-coding transcript  <cit> . moreover, expression levels of  <dig> intronic ncrnas were shown to correlate with the degree of tumor differentiation in prostate cancer  <cit> . the potential role of long ncrnas in human cancer is also exemplified by malat- <dig>  a 7-kb rna that was reported to be associated with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> . other reports have shown that totally or partially intronic long antisense transcripts may have regulatory functions, such as modulating the methylation status of promoters  <cit>  or the alternative splicing pattern of the corresponding protein-coding gene  <cit> . however, little attention has been given to the mechanism used by the cell to control the expression of these long intronic rnas.

androgens have been implicated in central events governing the regulation of distinct and diverse physiological processes in normal and neoplastic prostate cells. these hormones are known to promote cell division and proliferation of epithelial cells, to modulate programmed cell death and cell quiescence  <cit>  and to regulate cellular metabolism  <cit> . more recently, several studies have characterized the temporal transcriptional program reflecting the cellular response to androgens, which led to the identification of novel androgen-regulated protein-coding genes  <cit> .

in the present study, to identify androgen-responsive non-coding intronic rnas, we used a custom-built spotted cdna microarray enriched in intronic transcribed sequences and a prostate cancer cell line  cultured in the presence of a synthetic androgen. using orientation-specific reverse transcription followed by pcr  we determined the sense or antisense direction of a subset of intronic transcripts. we found that the levels of these intronic rnas in androgen-treated and control cells correlate with the levels of message or to the alternative usage of exons in the corresponding protein-coding transcript. additional approaches such as rapid amplification of the cdna ends  and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays  demonstrated that these intronic messages represent long and unspliced rna transcripts that may be directly regulated by the androgen receptor  in vivo. these findings indicate that transcription of long intronic ncrnas may be controlled by mechanisms common to protein-coding transcripts, such as those involving hormonal control of gene-promoter activation. in addition, our results indicate that a fraction of this class of long unspliced intronic rnas may have a role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by modulating transcript stability and alternative splicing.

RESULTS
identification of intronic rnas regulated by androgen
we used a spotted cdna microarray platform enriched in intronic transcripts  <cit>  to identify intronic rnas and exonic protein-coding messages that had significant changes in transcription levels when hormone-responsive lncap prostate cancer cells were treated with the synthetic androgen r <dig>  expression levels of klk <dig>   <cit>  and tmepai  <cit> , two genes previously shown to be upregulated by androgens in prostate epithelium, were determined by real-time pcr, confirming the effectiveness of androgens to induce responsive genes in our experimental conditions . next, we used significance analysis of microarrays   <cit>  to identify transcripts that showed statistically significant changes in levels after exposure to androgen for periods of 6– <dig> hours. only transcripts showing significant expression changes  for at least three consecutive time points were selected for further analysis. we found  <dig> protein-coding exonic messages  and  <dig> intronic rnas  that had statistically different patterns of temporal expression in androgen-treated cells compared with untreated controls .

androgen-regulated intronic rnas could be grouped into three clusters based on their different temporal patterns of expression after androgen exposure . cluster i contained rnas whose levels were 2–3-fold downregulated within  <dig> h after androgen exposure and were restored at  <dig> h. clusters ii and iii included intronic rnas that were upregulated by androgen within  <dig> h and later restored. cluster ii grouped rnas that were 2-t3-fold increased, and cluster iii grouped rnas that were upregulated 3–6-fold. all of these intronic rnas are unspliced messages, and apparently have no coding potential as determined by estscan analysis  <cit>  .

most mammalian snornas  <cit>  and a large fraction of micrornas  <cit>  are derived from intronic sequences of protein-coding and noncoding genes. to investigate the possibility that some of the androgen-regulated intronic transcripts might be primary transcripts that, after processing, could generate known small rnas of those classes, we compared the sequence of the  <dig> androgen-regulated intronic rnas with those of  <dig> snornas  <cit>  and  <dig> micrornas  <cit> ; no similarity was found.

we then investigated the enrichment of specific gene ontology  categories for androgen-regulated exonic and intronic transcripts using bingo, a gene ontology comparison tool  <cit> . we postulated that intronic transcripts represent a new class of rnas that might act as cis-regulatory factors  <cit> . thus, for each androgen-regulated intronic transcript we used the go annotation assigned to the corresponding protein-coding mrna mapping to the same genomic locus. we found no significant enrichment of specific go categories  among the selected sets of exonic or intronic androgen-regulated transcripts when a correction for multiple testing was applied. however, we noted that  <dig> of the set of  <dig> androgen-regulated intronic transcripts belonged to the signal-transduction go category . indeed, some of these loci have already been implicated in cellular events related to prostate cell growth and differentiation. for example, the protein encoded by gas <dig> mrna is a ligand of the axl receptor tyrosine kinase, and the gas6/axl complex has been shown to exhibit mitogenic activity in human prostatic cancer cell lines by modulating the pi3k/akt and mek signal-transduction pathways  <cit> . similarly, the transcription factor encoded by erg, a member of the ets family of central genes involved in integrating signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation, stress responses and tumorigenesis, has been previously identified as the most frequently overexpressed proto-oncogene in malignant prostate epithelial cells  <cit> .

characterization of androgen-regulated intronic rnas
orientation-specific rt-pcr was performed  on a selected set of androgen-regulated intronic rnas . sense or antisense orientation of the intronic rna relative to the corresponding protein-coding gene could be unambiguously assigned in most cases . for most of these  an intronic antisense rna could be detected . for six of these antisense rnas  we detected an overlapping intronic sense message transcribed in the opposite strand. four rnas  were only detected in the antisense orientation, and three intronic messages  were only detected in the sense orientation . the intronic sense transcripts of actn <dig>  stard <dig> and erg did not show coding potential as determined by estscan. without further experimentation, we could not determine if these intronic sense transcripts are novel non-coding exons present in alternative splicing forms, or if they represent ncrnas originated from independent intronic transcriptional units located in the sense strand. however, the latter explanation concurs with sense intronic transcriptional units that have been observed elsewhere  <cit> .

next, race-pcr experiments with cdna from prostate adenocarcinoma cells were performed for a selected set of intronic rnas to obtain their full-length sequences. this selected set comprised intronic rnas transcribed in the antisense , sense  or both antisense and sense orientations  as determined by orientation-specific rt-pcr. race experiments revealed that antisense intronic rnas from dnajc <dig> myo5a and itga <dig> were long , unspliced transcripts that mapped totally inside the intronic regions of the corresponding protein-coding gene . an unspliced, totally intronic sense transcript from stard <dig> of approximately  <dig>  kb was obtained . further analysis of the coding-potential by estscan indicated that extended intronic stard <dig> could generate a 74-residue peptide, but subsequent blastp searches  <cit>  did not show any similarity of this small predicted product to known proteins in genbank or to conserved protein domains at cdd  <cit> . we found in genbank a  <dig> -kb mrna cloned from a brain cdna library  that confirmed and extended the intronic antisense rna mapping to the gas <dig> locus. next, we performed pcr with primers complementary to the cdna probe mapping to an intron of gas <dig> deposited in the microarray and to the ak <dig> mrna. we obtained a  <dig> -kb amplicon, demonstrating that the gas <dig> antisense intronic rna transcribed in prostate cells was even longer  than the previously known rna .in silico analysis using estscan  <cit>  failed to identify open reading frames for extended intronic sequences transcribed from dnajc <dig>  itga <dig>  myo5a and gas <dig> loci.

a strand-specific northern blot confirmed the expression of a long  gas <dig> antisense transcript in various human tissues . the observation that androgen-regulated intronic rnas could be detected in tissues that are not particularly responsive to this hormone  suggests that regulation of the steady-state levels of these transcripts may also proceed through an androgen-independent pathway.

effect of androgen in the levels of intronic rnas and corresponding protein-coding transcripts
of the androgen-regulated transcripts identified in our analysis, only kdelr <dig> and add <dig> showed detectable changes in expression levels of both intronic and exonic transcripts. the intronic add <dig> transcript increased  <dig> -fold  in androgen-treated cells, whereas the corresponding protein-coding transcript decreased  <dig> -fold  in the same experiment. intronic kdelr <dig> transcript levels increased 2-fold , and the corresponding exonic transcript increased  <dig> -fold  in cells exposed to androgen relative to control cells . these results indicate that for a given intronic-exonic pair transcribed in the same locus, the intronic message may be directly or inversely modulated with respect to the exonic message after androgen treatment.

orientation-specific reverse transcription, followed by quantitative real-time pcr using rna from treated and control untreated cells, was used to confirm the change in levels of intronic transcripts after androgen exposure. we tested two intronic rnas that were detected only in the antisense orientation , and two intronic messages in which both antisense and sense transcription were measured  . in each case, we quantified in parallel the expression levels of exons of the corresponding protein-coding gene . we confirmed by quantitative pcr a 10-fold decrease of the intronic antisense transcript to gas <dig> after androgen stimulation . interestingly, protein-coding messages for gas <dig> that contain exons  <dig> and  <dig> were upregulated  under identical experimental conditions . we observed that the levels of sense and antisense intronic rnas at the dnajc <dig> locus were modulated in opposite directions after androgen treatment . the upregulation observed for the sense intronic rna from dnajc <dig> after androgen exposure was in agreement with the results from the microarray experiments , and was also observed for the protein-coding dnajc <dig> transcript . modification in the relative levels of intronic rnas from kdelr <dig> and itga <dig> after androgen treatment was confirmed . for kdelr <dig>  both antisense and sense intronic rna levels were upregulated by androgen . likewise, the antisense intronic rna at the itga <dig> locus was  <dig> -fold increased in the presence of androgen . however, in these cases we could not detect notable changes in the relative levels of the respective protein-coding transcripts when primers designed to measure constitutive exons were used .

to accumulate further evidence of functional involvement of antisense intronic non-coding transcripts on the splicing mechanism  <cit> , we investigated the existence of correlation between their relative levels and the levels of the corresponding protein-coding mrnas, using primers designed to probe regulated exons, that is, exons that are absent in at least one documented transcript isoform. at the kdelr <dig> locus, we found that exons  <dig> and  <dig> were upregulated  after androgen treatment . notably, exon  <dig> was absent in one kdelr <dig> transcript isoform . therefore, it is conceivable that the observed increase in the level of intronic antisense rna for kdelr <dig> after androgen treatment may induce increased retention of exon  <dig>  we could not detect any notable androgen-driven change in the levels of transcripts containing exons  <dig> and  <dig> or exons  <dig> and  <dig> . notwithstanding, we observed that exon  <dig> for kdelr <dig> was downregulated  <dig> -fold after androgen treatment when a pair of primers designed to probe only this exon was used . this result can only be accounted for by the accumulation after androgen treatment of an as yet uncharacterized alternative kdelr <dig> transcript with a shorter 3' end.

at the itga <dig> locus we found that the levels of a protein-coding transcript isoform containing a longer terminal exon  were downregulated  <dig> -fold after androgen treatment , and thus inversely correlated with the  <dig> -fold increase observed in the antisense intronic rna under the same conditions . however, it was not possible to determine whether this result was actually due to downregulation of the itga <dig> mrna isoform containing exon 22d, as we also detected downregulation of another intronic transcript naturally transcribed in the itga <dig> locus  that spans the 3' terminal exon of the gene .

non-coding rnas have been shown to affect splicing of protein-coding genes  <cit> . hbii- <dig>  a snorna was found to regulate alternative splicing of the serotonin receptor gene 5-ht2cra in trans, by binding to a silencing element in exon vb of 5-ht2cra  <cit> . lack of hbii- <dig> expression causes defective 5-ht2cra pre-mrna processing and probably accounts for the behavioral problems observed in patients with congenital prader-willi syndrome  <cit> . a previous study on the fas locus has identified a partially intronic antisense rna that is naturally transcribed from the first intron of the gene, which was named saf  <cit> . in vitro overexpression of saf induced skipping of several 3' exons of fas mrna, resulting in a fas protein that was no longer able to anchor to the cell membrane or to induce fas-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . our results identify novel intronic antisense rnas that might be involved in regulatory mechanisms of alternative splicing of protein-coding genes, in analogy to those observed for hbii- <dig> and fas/saf.

increased binding of the androgen receptor to an androgen response element motif upstream of asmyo5a
androgen-mediated transcriptional regulation involves direct hormone interaction with the ar protein and the translocation of this complex to the nucleus, promoting specific interactions with dna  motifs located near or within the target sequences  <cit> . to support a mechanism of direct transcriptional control of androgen-regulated intronic rnas, we used a bioinformatics approach  <cit>  to look for putative are motifs located upstream of the identified androgen-regulated intronic rnas. at least one putative are motif was identified for  <dig> androgen-regulated intronic transcripts .

chip assays were performed to verify functional binding of ar to a putative regulatory are motif located upstream of the intronic antisense rna mapping to the myo <dig> locus. the assays revealed that after androgen treatment there was a 2–3-fold increase in asmyo5a are motifs bound to ars . the asmyo5a are motif is located at a 5' genomic region  <dig> bp upstream of the region where the antisense myo5a intronic transcript maps. binding of ar to a previously described functional are that regulates transcription of the psa gene was tested in parallel as a positive control for the chip assay . a genomic region upstream from tuba <dig>  a gene that does not contain putative are motifs in its promoter region, was used as a negative control for non-specific immunoprecipitation of dna fragments .

the presence of a weak band for asmyo5a are in control cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-ar , indicating that binding of ar to asmyo5a are may occur to some extent in untreated cells. this may be explained by the presence of trace amounts of androgen remaining in charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum added to the cell-culture medium. an alternative explanation for the background signal of asmyo5a are measured in control cells may be the existence of small amounts of ar constitutively bound to the chromatin, as described for another transcription factor, cyclic amp-responsive element-binding protein   <cit> .

the increased binding of ar to the asmyo5a are motif is in agreement with the androgen-induced increased expression of the antisense intronic myo5a rna  detected by microarray , and confirmed by orientation-specific reverse transcription followed by real-time pcr . myo5a encodes an actin-based processive motor involved in intracellular trafficking and exocytosis  <cit> . tissue-specific myo5a isoforms are originated from alternative exon usage of the primary transcript, which in turn is thought to modulate the protein specificity for different cargoes within the cell  <cit> . it is conceivable that the increase in asmyo5a levels in prostate cells in response to androgen affects the relative levels of the alternatively spliced forms of myo5a, thus modulating protein activity or specificity. together, these results suggest that functional binding of androgen-ar activated complexes to regulatory are regions is required to modulate the levels of intronic antisense rnas after androgen treatment of prostate cells.

CONCLUSIONS
although there is still no conclusive evidence about the molecular mechanisms involved in response to androgen, we postulate that intronic transcripts exert their regulatory functions by acting in cis through watson-crick base-pairing to complementary sense pre-mrna  <cit> . the results presented here corroborate the notion that at least a fraction of these intronic transcripts may directly affect the levels and/or splicing of the protein-coding transcript originating in the opposite strand, and concur with previous reports in the literature  <cit> .

it is not yet clear if the intronic transcripts identified in this work exert their potential regulatory functions as long  rnas, or alternatively, as shorter rnas resulting from processing of the primary transcript. processing of these androgen-regulated ncrnas into shorter rnas of defined sizes would also raise the possibility that some may modulate transcriptional or post-transcriptional events in messages from different loci, in a manner similar to micrornas  <cit> . the identification of possible short rnas modulated by androgen will require further work, such as 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or northern blots of prostate cells exposed to androgen in time-course experiments to document the accumulation of the long intronic rnas, the time course of their conversion to short rnas, and the accumulation of possible short rna intermediates.

previous reports have shown that a large number of transcription-factor binding sites  for well-characterized transcription factors such as sp <dig>  c-myc, p <dig> and creb lie upstream to transcriptionally active intronic regions  <cit> , some of which generate transcripts that are oriented antisense relative to the known gene  <cit> . notably, cawley et al  <cit>  found that comparable fractions of protein-coding genes and ncrnas having an experimentally determined upstream tfbs region were regulated after exposure to retinoic acid. the results presented here provide further evidence that ncrnas transcribed from intronic segments of the human genome may be regulated by physiological signals that commonly act on protein coding-transcripts such as hormones. similar results were observed in mice when the effect of lipopolysaccharide stimulation on the levels of several long ncrnas was measured  <cit> . together, these results strongly suggest that at least in mammalian cells intronic ncrnas are transcribed in a regulated fashion and therefore must exert physiological roles, which corroborates the existence of a yet underappreciated complex rna-based regulatory system involving non-coding messages in higher organisms  <cit> .
