BACKGROUND
plant disease resistance and susceptibility are governed by the combined genotypes of host and pathogen, and depend on a complex exchange of signals and responses occurring under given environmental conditions. during the long processes of host-pathogen co-evolution, plants have developed various elaborate mechanisms to ward off pathogen attack  <cit> . a key difference between resistant and susceptible plants is the timely recognition of the invading pathogen, and the rapid and effective activation of host defense mechanisms. the activation of defense responses in plants is initiated by host recognition of pathogen-encoded molecules called elicitors  <cit> . the interaction of pathogen elicitors with host receptors likely activates a signal transduction cascade that may involve protein phosphorylation, ion fluxes, reactive oxygen species , and other signaling events  <cit> . subsequent transcriptional and/or posttranslational activation of transcription factors eventually leads to the induction of plant defense related genes  <cit> . in addition to eliciting primary defense responses, pathogen signals may be amplified through the generation of secondary plant signal molecules such as salicylic acid  <cit> . both primary pathogen elicitors and secondary endogenous signals may trigger a diverse array of plant defense related genes, encoding glutathione s-transferases , peroxidases, cell wall proteins, proteinase inhibitors, hydrolytic enzymes, pathogenesis-related  proteins and phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> .

at the macroscopic level, induced defense responses are frequently manifested in part as a hypersensitive response , which is characterized by necrotic lesions resulting from localized host cell death at the site of infection  <cit> . plant cell death occurring during the hr plays an important role in preventing the growth and spread of biotrophic pathogen into healthy tissues  <cit> . in addition to the localized hr, plants may respond to pathogen infection by activating defense responses in uninfected parts of the plant, expressing so called systemic acquired resistance  that can be long-lasting and often confers broad-based resistance to a variety of different pathogens  <cit> .

stripe rust , caused by puccinia striiformis westend. f. sp. tritici eriks. , is one of the most important diseases of wheat  worldwide. severe yield losses can result as a consequence of the rapid development and large-scale spread of the disease epidemic under optimal environmental conditions. furthermore, the ability of pst to form new races that can attack previously resistant cultivars, along with the capacity of fungal spores to travel long distances, can make control of stripe rust difficult. over the last few years, epidemiological  <cit> , genetic  <cit> , histological  <cit>  and molecular  <cit>  studies on the disease and pathogen have been reported. the wheat-pst interactions have been studied at the molecular genetics and ultrastructural levels  <cit> . due to special features of hexaploid wheat with large and complex genome and difficulties for transformation, and of pst without sexual reproduction and hard to culture on media  <cit> , the use of most genetic and molecular techniques in studying genes involved in the wheat-pst interactions has been largely limited. thus, a global gene expression approach should be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the wheat-pst interactions.

significant progresses have been made for understanding the signaling processes involved in several plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . a few studies on the wheat-rust fungus interaction have been carried out using the wheat genechip®  <cit> . the use of the wheat genechip® technique is often conditioned by known gene sequences arrayed on the chip, with limited ests unspecific to different wheat materials. in contrast, cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism  does not require prior sequence information and is universal for any organisms or interactions, and is, therefore, a powerful tool for identifying novel genes in non-model organisms  <cit> , such as wheat  <cit> . as described by bachem et al., cdna-aflp is an efficient, sensitive, and reproducible technique to detect differentially expressed genes dynamically  <cit> .

in our previous study, we identified  <dig> genes likely involved in a compatible interaction between wheat  and pst  using the cdna-aflp technique  <cit> . a parallel study for an incompatible interaction should allow us to compare genes involved in the compatible and incompatible interactions, which should provides insights to molecular mechanisms of the different interactions of the important wheat-pst pathosystem. the objective of this study was to determine wheat genes that are transcriptionally regulated in response to pst infection using the cdna-aflp technique in a whole-genome scale. the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  analysis was also used to validate the expression patterns of some important genes. here, we report a number of transcript derived fragments  that were found to be activated or suppressed during the incompatible interaction between wheat and pst. in particular, a large number of genes encoding signal molecules were identified as early pathogen responsive genes and potential defense-related genes. genes specifically expressed during the incompatible interaction were identified through comparing the transcription profiling in the present study with that of our previous study on compatible interaction  <cit> .

RESULTS
infection process of stripe rust fungus and hr
in the incompatible interaction, at  <dig> hpi when haustorial mother cells were in contact with mesophyll cells, hr was observed at the infection sites . at  <dig> hpi, the host cells undergoing hr still looked intact . with advancing incubation time, an increasing number of host cells took up hr and started to lose their original shape. necrotic host cells could be observed at almost every infection site by  <dig> hpi, . up to  <dig> hpi, large number of host cell deceased and fungal spread were inhibited at infection sites . however, in the compatible interaction, there was no indication of cell death at infection sites . the results showed that these samples were suitable for further experiments and analyses.

isolation of differentially expressed genes
transcript derived fragments displayed by cdna-aflp analysis ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, depending on primer combinations and time points. for each of the  <dig> primer combinations, 55~ <dig> bands were observed. figure  <dig> showed an example of the expression patterns of the genes revealed using cdna-aflp with the primer pair mtt+tac. a total of  <dig>  fragments were obtained with  <dig> primer pairs. the cdna-aflp fragments were highly reproducible as the band intensities were similar from the three biological replications for each time-point. altered expression patterns after inoculation were detected for  <dig>  tdfs compared to the near  <dig> hpi mock-inoculation control and among the different time points, accounting for  <dig> % of displayed fragments. of the  <dig>  tdfs,  <dig>  were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. a total of  <dig> tdfs were selected based on their intensity differences at various time points for attempted further analysis, of which  <dig> were recovered from gels, re-amplified, cloned and sequenced.

the blastn searching of the p. graminis f. sp. tritici genome database for the  <dig> tdfs indicated that  <dig>  of the sequenced tdfs were likely from pst and  <dig>  were likely from wheat, and remaining  <dig>  were unclear about their origin because they had no hit. of the  <dig> tdfs, putatively encoding atp synthase, glycine dehydrogenase, fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase, atp-dependent rna helicase, t-complex protein, enolase and conserved hypothetical proteins,  <dig> had significant homologies  to p. graminis f. sp. tritici genes. however, all of the  <dig> tdfs were finally determined to be from wheat through pcr amplification of the genomic dna of the suwon  <dig> wheat and cyr <dig> pst pathotype, as  <dig> fragments were amplified only from the wheat, and  <dig> from both wheat and stripe rust pathogen but the wheat sequences were identical to those of the tdfs.

the comparative analysis between the incompatible and compatible interactions by the tblastn searching showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> tdfs identified in the incompatible interaction were also induced in the compatible interaction  <cit> , indicating that the  <dig> tdfs are involved in the basal defense. the remaining  <dig> tdfs were considered to be expressed more specifically in the incompatible interaction ,  <dig> of  <dig> tdfs were further analyzed by qrt-pcr.

validation of expression patterns by qrt- pcr analysis
to validate the results of the cdna-aflp and comparative analyses, twenty tdfs were studied for verifying the expression patterns identified in the cdna-aflp study using  <dig> time-points  , forty three tdfs were analyzed mainly for comparing their expressions in the incompatible and compatible interactions, and therefore, only  <dig> time-points  were chosen based on their major differences in the cdna-aflp study . the results showed that  <dig> of  <dig> tdfs were induced in both incompatible and compatible interactions. although in similar expression patterns, the  <dig> genes expressed earlier and at higher levels in the incompatible interaction than in the compatible interaction, of which  <dig> tdfs had expression levels great than  <dig> folds of the mock inoculated controls . the transcriptional products of  <dig> tdfs were decreased slightly in both interactions, compared with those in the controls . the remaining  <dig> tdfs were up-regulated in the incompatible interaction, but did not have significant changes or were down-regulated in the compatible interaction .

the  <dig> genes selected to verify the cdna-aflp results included  <dig> genes  putatively involved in disease defense,  <dig> genes  putatively involved in signal transduction,  <dig> gene  in the "no-hit" group, and  <dig> genes  in other categories. all of the genes were up-regulated and their transcripts increased as early as  <dig> hpi, except for tdfs s11_cy23_contig <dig> and s11_cy23_130- <dig>  whose expression did not increased until  <dig> hpi and for s11_cy23_469- <dig> until  <dig> hpi. the accumulation of transcripts of eight genes  peaked at  <dig> hpi with pst, and the others peaked at  <dig> hpi, except that the maximum induction of s11_cy23_469- <dig> and s11_cy23_130- <dig> transcripts occurred at  <dig> hpi and then steadily decreased to the original levels. tdf s11_cy23_contig <dig> was activated as early as  <dig> hpi, and followed by a slight decrease, this gene reached their maximum accumulation of transcripts at  <dig> hpi. for all of the  <dig> genes, the expression patterns of the qrt-pcr were similar to those observed in the cdna-aflp tests. the results showed that the cdna-aflp technique was more efficient in identified expressed genes and also indicated that all of the studied genes were induced by the pst infection

discussion
transcriptomics is a powerful approach for the global analysis of plant-pathogen interactions. using the cdna-aflp technique, we observed widespread modulation of transcriptional activity, with  <dig> % of all transcripts showing some form of differential expression. the gene expression patterns revealed by the cdna-aflp and qrt-pcr analyses were largely consistent with the physiological and biochemistry changes corresponding to the pst infection events in the wheat leaf tissue.

about 73%  of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes in wheat were up-regulated during the infection process. most of these genes peaked at 12~ <dig> hpi, possibly reflecting the exploitation of cellular resources and/or the activation of defense responses  <cit> . the up-regulated genes were similar to that of a recent study reported by coram et al.  <cit> . they reported that  <dig> genes specifically involved in the incompatible reaction between the yr <dig> single gene line with a us pst pathotype, pst- <dig>  and these genes were up-regulated and peaked at 12- <dig> hpi. in these study, we identified  <dig> genes preferably induced in the incompatible interaction, also around 12- <dig> hpi. the most of the genes identified in both studies were characterized in the same functional categories. in contrast, coram et al. identified only one gene down-regulated in the incompatible interaction  <cit> . comparatively,  <dig> tdfs of  <dig> differentially expressed genes showed down-regulation in the present study. such difference might be due to the fact that the probes of affymetrix genechip were designed based on known wheat genes. meantime, the transcriptional profiling obtained by cdna-aflp technique largely covered overall wheat transcriptome. moreover, different genotypes of wheat or pst pathotype, as well as different temperatures used in the tests, might also contribute to the difference. given that genetic manipulation for pst is unavailable, along with unstable wheat transformation system, the putative functions of a large number of genes identified in this study have only been predicted by bioinformatical approaches combined with altered expression patterns. of the  <dig> sequenced tdfs,  <dig> had relatively clear functions in various categories when searching the non-redundant protein database. thus, these genes can be valuable resources for understanding molecular changes in the incompatible interaction.

a fascinating discovery in this study is the quenching of divergent expression of pst-regulated genes in both incompatible and compatible interactions in the middle stages of pst infection. similar to the results of our previous study  <cit> , the expression of nearly all wheat genes that were differentially regulated at the early time frame returned to the levels of the mock-inoculted plants by  <dig> hpi. the low level of expression remained up to  <dig> hpi. the lack of differential gene expression at the period from  <dig> to  <dig> hpi could be because pst might initiatively inhibit the early host responses in both incompatible and compatible interactions. haustorium-forming fungi and oomycetes secrete many proteins from the haustoria into the extrahaustorial matrix during the parasitic stage of host infection, subsequently, a subset of proteins are further transported into the host cell  <cit> . presumably, to establish infection, these proteins enable the pathogens to obtain nutrients, or to evade or manipulate host defenses  <cit> . it is thought that the oomycete phytophthora also forms haustoria and secretes molecular signals that functions in the plant apoplast and cytoplasm to reprogram molecular host defenses  <cit> . the response of resistant plants at 48- <dig> hpi suggests that an avirulence gene is recognized by a resistance gene prior to this time, which appears to lead to a depression of host defenses. our results may reflect that the resistance gene can be recognized by avirulence gene prior to  <dig> hpi in the interaction of wheat-pst. similar to our results, a study of the soybean response to asian soybean rust  controlled by the rpp <dig> gene also found many asr-regulated genes responded early during the infection , followed by a period  in which expression levels returned to the mock levels and a new differentiation in gene expression during late infection   <cit> .

the development of pst on resistant and susceptible wheat cv. suwon  <dig> was found to be similar in urediniospore germination, appressorium formation, and penetration . however, after penetration , distinct differences in fungal spread between the compatible and incompatible interaction could be observed. in the compatible interaction, hyphae of cyr <dig> rapidly colonized host tissues intercellularly and numerous haustoria in the adjacent host cells were formed. in the incompatible interaction, the host cells showed hypersensitive cell death and the density of the intercellular hyphae and the number of haustoria were greatly reduced compared to the compatible interaction  <cit> . these results suggested that resistance to stripe rust in wheat cv. suwon <dig> is executed after penetration has occurred. yet, for host response to pst, h2o <dig> accumulation was detected in host guard cells as early as 6- <dig> hpi  <cit> , therefore, the perception of the pst fungus by wheat and the ability of the pathogen to avoid or overcome the host's defense imply a complex, dynamic network of communication, a series of signal events should be operated before the resistance gene is expressed. relative specifically expression of the  <dig> genes in the incompatible interaction and their diverse putative functions in various metabolisms support the hypothesis. however, how and when the signal is perceived by the host and transduced is still poorly understood. in this study, we focused on genes that accumulated preferentially in the incompatible reaction before  <dig> hpi. dissection of these genes and their involved biochemical pathways in the future studies might provide answers to the questions.

because the regulation of gene expression is a dynamic process, the expression profiling was presented over a time course by cdna-aflp, which allowed us to study the dynamic behavior of gene expression and characterize their changes over time. the induction and signal transduction of defense responses specific to the interaction require up- or down- regulation of many genes. we were primarily interested in genes whose expression might be used to distinguish incompatible from compatible interactions in wheat. a different analysis was conducted to achieve the goal by comparing gene expressions in suwon  <dig> challenged with cyr <dig>  or cyr <dig> . the comparison analysis of  <dig> tdfs in the incompatible interaction with those in the compatible interaction as previously described  <cit>  showed that of the  <dig> transcripts induced during the incompatible interaction,  <dig> tdfs  were also induced during the compatible interaction, and thus were classified as basal defense-related.  <dig> tdfs were expressed preferably in the incompatible interaction. the large proportion of tdfs were shared in both interactions, these results were similar to the reports of coram et al.  <cit>  with the same pathosystem. coram et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> genes commonly induced in both incompatible and compatible interactions between wheat and pst. tao et al.  <cit>  also found that plant responses in compatible and incompatible interactions are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different soon after infection. another study of the barley response to powdery mildew controlled by the mla <dig>  mla <dig> and mla <dig> single resistance genes also provided evidence for a shared response between compatible and incompatible interactions up to the point of pathogen penetration  <cit> .

of our special interest is that  <dig> of  <dig> tdfs were up-regulated in the incompatible interaction, but did not change or were repressed in compatible interaction through the qrt-pcr validation. of the  <dig> tdfs,  <dig>  have unknown functions and  <dig>  encode leucine rich repeat family protein, cbl-interacting protein kinase, serine/threonine kinase, ethylene-responsive rna helicase and protein phosphatase type 2c, respectively. protein phosphatase type 2c is a negative regulator of aba responses. gosti et al.  <cit>  reported that suppressor mutants were more sensitive to applied aba than the wild type and displayed increases in seed dormancy, whole-plant drought tolerance, and drought rhizogenesis intensity. however, aba is required for plant defense. adie et al.  <cit>  measured aba hormone levels in wild-type and ja/et/sa/aba-related mutants after pythium irregulare infection to determine whether aba is required for overall plant resistance. they found that aba mutants showed an increased susceptibility to p. irregulare compared with the wild-type background, indicating that aba is a positive signal involved in the activation of effective defenses against this pathogen. however, several reports showed that aba increases susceptibility by counteracting sa-dependent defenses, and aba-dependent priming of callose biosynthesis promotes enhanced resistance to some pathogens  <cit> . these results supported that aba should have a negative effect on resistance. our results also indicated that aba should be expected to play a negative role in response to pst. dead-box rna helicases had been reported to play an important role during development and stress responses in various organisms  <cit> . rice osbirh <dig> encoding dead box rna helicase was shown to function in defense responses against pathogen and oxidative stresses  <cit> . strs <dig>  and strs <dig> encoding dead box rna helicases were shown to function as negative regulators of aba-dependent and aba-independent signaling networks  <cit> . zegzouti  <cit>  isolated an ethylene-responsive  <dig> , their results indicated the potential for er <dig> rna helicase activity to be involved with ethylene-regulated gene expression at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. similar to their results, s11_cy23_contig <dig> encoding ethylene-responsive rna helicase, was only induced in incompatible interaction, which should attribute to resistance to pst, however, the precise role played by s11_cy23_contig <dig> still needs to be further elucidated.

caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferases  is an important enzyme that participates in lignin biosynthesis especially in the formation of cell wall ferulic esters of plants. ccoaomt was proposed to play a pivotal role in cell wall reinforcement during the induced disease resistance response. lignin is often deposited at the sites of wounding or pathogen invasion, which may provide a physical barrier for protection of adjacent tissues from further damage. in the previous study  <cit> , immunogold localization of lignin revealed a markedly higher labeling density in host cell walls of the infected wheat leaves of the resistant cultivar than in cell walls of the infected wheat leaves of the susceptible cultivar. in this study, s11_cy23_360- <dig> encoding ccoaomt, induced at  <dig> hpi, and peaked at  <dig> hpi in the incompatible interaction, the transcripts accumulations occurred after the resistance gene was triggered, which indicated that lignification appears to be also an active resistance mechanism in the wheat-pst panthosystem.

suwon  <dig> showed hr to cy <dig> infection. plant cells involved in the hr generate an oxidative burst by producing reactive oxygen species , superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and nitrous oxide  <cit> . peroxidases were thought to play an important role in ros production  <cit> . in the present study, two genes  were predicted to encode peroxidase and peroxisomal membrane protein, respectively. their transcripts peaked as early as  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively. our gene expression data were coincident with the previous report of a rapid increase of o2-- and h2o <dig> at infection sites and a strong accumulation of h2o <dig> in mesophyll cells from 12~ <dig> hpi using histochemical staining in the suwon  <dig> leaves inoculated by cyr <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, o2- and h2o <dig> could not be detected in most of the infection sites in the compatible interaction between suwon  <dig> and cyr <dig>  in the present study, we found that the expression of these two genes were much less in the compatible interaction than in the incompatible interaction.

several studies have provided evidence supporting that the pr- <dig> protein plays an active role in resistance mechanisms in cereals  <cit> . transcripts of four pr protein genes were analyzed during fusarium graminearum infection, with pr- <dig> transcript accumulated as early as  <dig> to  <dig> hpi and peaked at  <dig> hpi  <cit> . we also found s11_cy23_ <dig> homologous to a wheat pr-5-like protein gene. s11_cy23_ <dig> transcript accumulated strongly at 24- <dig> hpi. a stronger induction of this gene could be observed in the incompatible interaction than the compatible interaction, suggesting a general role of this protein in wheat resistance to stripe rust. similarly, gene s11_cy23_274- <dig> from wheat was deduced to encode a receptor related to antifungal pr proteins. the predicted protein contained an extracellular domain related to the pr  <dig> protein, a central transmembrane spanning domain, and an intracellular protein serine/threonine kinase. wang et al. isolated a pr5k gene from arabidopsis thaliana and found that pr5k transcript accumulated at low levels in all tissues examined  <cit> . they suggested a possible interaction of pr5k with common or related microbial targets. nevertheless, the interrelation of pr5k and pr <dig> protein during the interaction between wheat and pst need further studies.

protein kinase is known to play a central role in signaling during pathogen recognition and the subsequent activation of plant defense mechanisms  <cit> . we identified six tdfs encoding different protein kinases. s11_cy23_contig <dig> was highly homologous to the arabidopsis mkp <dig> gene, which was showed to be induced at the transcriptional level during the interaction of wheat-pst. the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> genes encoding mitogen-activated protein kinases , which interact with mkp <dig>  <cit> . using expression profiling, a specific group of genes that probably represent targets of mkp <dig> regulation was also identified  <cit> . surprisingly, the identity of these genes and interacting mapks suggested involvement of mkp <dig> in salt stress responses. indeed, mkp <dig> plants have increased resistance to salinity  <cit> . accordingly, the gene s11_cy23_contig <dig> may play a role in the integration and fine-tuning of plant responses to stripe rust pathogen challenging.

this study uncovered a number of new candidate genes possibly involved in the interactions of wheat and pst. more than 42% of the sequenced tdfs had no homologous sequences in the est databases. de torres et al.  <cit>  reported that the plant response to pathogen challenge evoked a large number of transcriptomic components not yet present in est libraries. over 60% of the differentially regulated transcripts in their cdna-aflp were absent from standard  <dig>  feature affymetrix gene chips  <cit> . therefore, cdna-aflp analysis is a suitable tool for discovering new potential genes that are differentially expressed during the wheat-pst interactions. because most of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathosystem interactions are yet to be determined, the large number of tdfs identified in this study will serve as candidates for further studies to determine their functions and dissect the molecular networks involved in the plant-pathogen interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have obtained a broad overview of the behaviour of the wheat transcriptomes to the stripe rust fungus and this has provided many interesting clues to the interaction of the wheat and pst. we have also seen the differences between the incompatible  and compatible  interaction. with regard to many genes, we observed patterns of transcript accumulation that reflect those observed by other groups in their studies. however, as a consequence of this study, we have also made observations that give additional insight in the complexities of the interactions that occur in both interactions, and uncovered a number of new candidate genes possibly involved in the interactions of wheat and pst. especially,  <dig> tdfs expressed specifically in the incompatible interaction were observed, and these genes should play important roles in the interaction of wheat and pst. however, how and when they function in the infection process, need to be further studied.
