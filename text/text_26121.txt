BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, metabolically versatile and environmentally ubiquitous bacterial species that is capable of surviving in a variety of animal and plant hosts and causing opportunistic infections in humans. it is responsible for serious chronic and often fatal lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and acute infections in patients that are immune compromised or have serious burns  <cit> . infections caused by p. aeruginosa often are difficult to treat due to their intrinsic resistance to diverse antibiotics and their capacity for adaptive resistance  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa, major mechanisms of multidrug resistance include the production of enzymes that inactivate β-lactamases and aminoglycosides through modification, alterations in topoisomerases, reduced expression of genes encoding outer membrane proteins such as oprd, and increased expression of genes encoding efflux pumps  <cit> . additionally p. aeruginosa can exhibit adaptive resistance, whereby sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics transiently increase resistance to lethal doses. this adaption occurs largely as a result of expression of the mexxy-oprm efflux  <cit>  and arnbcadtef-ugd lipopolysaccharide modification operons  <cit> .

the versatility of p. aeruginosa in adapting to different environments has been attributed in part to the complex regulatory networks that coordinate the control of genes involved in adaptation, including coordination of two-component signal transduction  systems and quorum sensing  <cit> . the p. aeruginosa genome appears to be especially rich in two-component signal transduction  systems, which use phosphorylation as a mechanism for responding to specific environmental cues  <cit> . annotations of p. aeruginosa genomes have identified  <dig> potential tcsts, most of which have not been characterized functionally  <cit> . the pars/parr tcst is a key regulatory component for intrinsic and adaptive multidrug resistance in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . as is typical of tcst systems, the pars/parr system consists of a membrane-bound histidine sensor kinase  and a cytoplasmic response regulator . mutations in parr result in susceptibility to a wide range of antibiotics including polymyxin b, gentamycin and tobramycin  <cit> . previous microarray analyses identified over  <dig> genes controlled by the pars/parr system in the presence of antimicrobial agents  <cit> . among them are genes encoding the outer membrane porin protein oprd, the rnd efflux pump mexxy-oprm, and the arnbcadtef-ugd lipopolysaccharide modification operon.

the p. aeruginosa genome also contains a diversity of quorum-sensing  systems. qs gene regulation has been described as a method of cell-cell communication used by bacteria to synchronize gene expression within a population  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa, qs depends on the autoinducer synthases lasi, rhli and pqsabcdh/phnab as well as their cognate transcriptional regulators lasr, rhlr and pqsr , respectively  <cit> . lasi and rhli synthesize the canonical autoinducers 3-oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone  and butanoyl-homoserine lactone  respectively, which cause transcriptional responses by interacting with lasr and rhlr. in contrast, pqsabcdh/phnab catalyzes the synthesis of 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone , which in turn regulates gene expression through the pqsr protein  <cit> . the three qs systems function in a hierarchical manner whereby the lasr/i system positively regulates the rhlr/i system, and pqs is considered the terminal signal  <cit> . this interlinked qs network controls the expression of multiple virulence factors including exoenzymes, toxins, and secondary metabolites  as well as the ability to form biofilms  <cit> . indeed, activation of the qs signaling systems in p. aeruginosa causes significant transcriptional changes. for instance, transcriptome analysis using microarrays identified  <dig> qs-induced and  <dig> qs-repressed genes, representing about 6% of the p. aeruginosa genome  <cit> .

rnd efflux systems  are important not only for intrinsic and/or adaptive resistance to antimicrobial compounds in p. aeruginosa, but they affect the transport of qs signals and precursors and thus qs-dependent phenotypes  <cit> . each rnd efflux system typically consists of a cytoplasmic membrane component that functions as a transporter , an outer membrane component presumed to form channels , and a protein presumed to link the two membrane proteins   <cit> . the rnd efflux systems differ somewhat in substrate specificities. for example, mexxy-oprm is capable of excreting aminoglycosides and certain unrelated antibiotics , whereas mexab-oprm and mexcd-oprj are responsible for excreting other antibiotics including quinolones and β-lactams  <cit> . the mexef-oprn rnd efflux pump transports fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim, as well as chloramphenicol  <cit> . in addition to its role in resistance to antibiotics, the mexab-oprm efflux pump has been shown to play a role in the selective transport of quorum sensing signals  <cit> . the mexef-oprn efflux pump also exports the pqs precursor 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline  and affects many qs-dependent virulence phenotypes  <cit> . indeed, 40% of the genes  regulated by mexef-oprn belong to the qs regulon  <cit> .

to date most of what is known about the linkage between tcst regulation, especially via the pars/parr operon, quorum sensing, and rnd efflux pumps in the control of adaptation and virulence traits comes from studies comparing mutants to wild-type in the presence of antimicrobials. interestingly, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  analysis revealed that parr-dependent genes such as arnbcadtef-ugd, pmrb, pagl and pa <dig> are not induced by parr in the absence of indolicidin, suggesting that the pars/parr system regulates gene expression in an environment-dependent manner  <cit> . the objectives of the current study were to identify, using rna-seq whole transcriptome analysis, genes differentially regulated by the pars/parr system in the absence of antimicrobials. we discuss the hierarchical relationship of the regulatory elements and the suites of traits controlled by each.

RESULTS
growth dependent expression of pars and parr in wild type p. aeruginosa pao1
transcriptomic analysis revealed that in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the pars  and parr  genes are located in a single operon, as indicated by the absence of non-coding nucleotides between the two genes. to determine the cell density at which expression of pars and parr are optimal for transcriptomic analysis, qrt-pcr was conducted using wild-type pao <dig> at six different cell densities. the transcript abundances of pars and parr were similar to each other over time and the highest values were observed at an od <dig> of  <dig>   . moreover, the qrt-pcr results showed that the transcript abundance of pars and parr  was 3– <dig> fold higher when grown in ab minimal medium + 2% casamino acids  as compared to lb medium. thus, subsequent work was performed using p. aeruginosa grown in ab minimal medium + 2% caa at od600 ~  <dig> .

quantitative analysis of the wild type p. aeruginosa pao <dig> transcriptome
rna-seq data representing the alignment of sequences  to coding sequences  were quantified as reads per kilobase cds length per million reads analyzed , as described previously  <cit> . the rna-seq analysis provided a gene expression map showing log  values for all  <dig> annotated genes in the pao <dig> genome . the mean and medium values were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicting a pronounced skew toward highly expressed genes . a total of  <dig> genes were expressed higher than  <dig> , whereas the remaining  <dig> genes were expressed at lower levels than the mean value . genes within large genomic loci  showed similar patterns in transcript abundance. for example, genes within the region between pa <dig> and pa <dig>  were expressed at a relatively low level compared with the more highly expressed genes in the chromosomal segment from pa <dig> to pa <dig>  .

the top  <dig> highly expressed genes  are included in additional file 2: table s <dig> and many are indicated in figure 1a. the gene with the greatest transcript abundance in the wild type strain under our experimental conditions was pa <dig> , having a log  value of  <dig>  . two other membrane protein genes  also had high transcript levels  . consistently, the protein levels of opri, oprf and oprg were shown previously to be highly abundant in p. aeruginosa <cit> .

genes in the top twenty include virulence-related genes such as pila  <cit> , flic <cit> , azu  <cit> , oprf  <cit> , fabf  <cit> , capb  <cit> , lon  <cit>  and sodb  <cit> . in contrast, the transcripts of  <dig> genes were not detected  suggesting these genes are barely expressed under the conditions tested. as expected, among the genes with rpkm +  <dig> values of  <dig> were  <dig> genes annotated as encoding hypothetical proteins or proteins with unknown functions.

the relative transcript abundance of the  <dig> genes annotated as being part of tcst systems  are provided in additional file 3: table s <dig>  the average of the log  values for the tcst genes was  <dig> , which is relatively low compared to the mean value of  <dig>  for all genes. in fact, none of the tcst gene had a log  value above  <dig>  the pars and parr genes were expressed at medium levels . overall, response regulator genes were expressed at higher levels compared with the sensor kinase genes. for instance, among the top twenty highly expressed tcst system genes , sixteen were response regulator genes. in contrast, sixteen sensor kinase genes were found among the twenty least expressed tcst system genes under these growth conditions .

pars and parr regulated genes
in order to identify genes regulated by the pars/parr system in pao <dig>  mean rpkm values for both pars and parr mutants were compared with the wild type. the ratios of rpkm values  were log-transformed to better illustrate genes that were differentially expressed in pars and parr mutants. as shown in figure  <dig>  mutations in pars or parr caused similar changes in the pao <dig> transcriptome at the mid log phase. the transcript abundance of a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were changed in the pars and parr mutants compared to wild type, respectively . of these genes,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in both pars and parr mutants  . these results suggest that mutations in pars and parr have both common and differential influences on the bacterial transcriptome.

among the  <dig> genes activated by both pars and parr, only  <dig> genes  have been functionally characterized in p. aeruginosa  and further discussion of these genes appears below. among the  <dig> genes repressed by both pars and parr were genes encoding enzymes , genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis , and genes involved nitrous oxide reduction . to validate the expression profiles obtained by rna-seq, qrt-pcr was performed on  <dig> genes; these included genes encoding for components of the quorum sensing systems, enzymes involved in chitin degradation, phenazine and rhamnolipid synthesis, and proteins previously shown to respond to toxic compounds. the data  from the qrt-pcr analysis were comparable to those obtained by the rna-seq analysis for all selected genes , thus verifying the rna-seq data.

alog expression ratio ≥ <dig>  indicates genes are up-regulated in mutants and ≤ − <dig> indicates genes are down-regulated in mutants.

the pars/parr system activates the mexef-oprn operon through mexs
the sequence reads from the wild type and parr mutant were mapped to the genome sequence of the mexef-oprn region and displayed using artemis and bamview . compared to the wild type strain, which had abundant reads over the mexef-oprn operon, few reads were detected across this region for the parr mutant. the pars mutant showed a similar expression pattern to that of the parr mutant . consistently, the log  values were around  <dig>  for mexe, mexf and oprn, for the wild type, whereas deletion of pars or parr reduced the values to less than  <dig>  . qrt-pcr also confirmed that the expression of mexf and oprn was highly down-regulated by log  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the parr mutant and by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the pars mutant compared with wild type, consistent with the rna-seq data .

as reported previously, expression of the mexef-oprn operon is under the positive control of the dna-binding protein mvat  <cit> , the oxidoreductase mexs  <cit>  and the lysr family protein mext  <cit> . transcripts of mvat were expressed at similar high levels in the wild type and mutant strains: log  values for wild type, pars and parr mutants were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. although the expression of mext was not appreciably altered, mutation in pars/parr reduced the transcript levels of mexs . since regulation of mexef-oprn by mexs depends on mext  <cit> , these results suggest that the pars/parr system activates the mexef-oprn operon through the mexs-mext pathway.

the pars/parr system negatively controls quorum sensing
it was shown previously that the mexef-oprn efflux pump interferes with quorum sensing by extruding hhq and kynurenine in p. aeruginosa <cit> . moreover, a quorum sensing regulatory gene encoding the quorum threshold expression element qtee  <cit>  also was differentially expressed in pars and parr mutants . therefore, the pars/parr system has regulatory effects on qs in p. aeruginosa. indeed, transcripts of rhli and rhlr were elevated in pars and parr mutants compared with the wild type . although the expression levels of lasi and lasr were not altered, the rsal gene was slightly increased in the parr mutant. the pqsabcde and phnab operons also were expressed at higher levels in the mutant strains. the pqsabcde-phnab cluster is known to be positively controlled by the cognate regulator pqsr, also named mvfr  <cit> . interestingly, pqsr was expressed at similar levels in the wild type  and mutant strains  suggesting that the pars/parr system regulates the level of pqsabcde-phnab independently of pqsr.

to better understand how pars-parr regulates the three qs systems in p. aeruginosa, the transcript abundances of lasi, rhli and pqsa were monitored at six different cell densities in the wild type and parr mutant . the lasi gene appeared to be constitutively expressed and reached the highest level at an od <dig> of  <dig>  in both wild type and parr mutant. in contrast, wild type and the parr mutant exhibited different patterns in the expression of the rhli and pqsa genes. first, the expression levels of both rhli and pqsa were not detectable until cultures reached an od <dig> of  <dig>  in the wild type, whereas these genes were detected at od <dig> of  <dig>  in the mutant strains. secondly, the transcripts of rhli and pqsa genes reached their highest levels at an od <dig> of  <dig>  for the wild type, but at an od <dig> of  <dig>  for the parr mutant. together, these results confirm a role of the pars/parr system in controlling the timing of qs gene expression in p. aeruginosa.

genes known to be activated by pars/parr system in the presence of antimicrobials
in the presence of antimicrobial agents such as indolicidin, the parr protein promotes drug resistance through several known, distinct mechanisms including: activating the mexxy efflux genes, suppressing the expression of oprd porin, and enhancing lipopolysaccharide modification through the arn genes . the rna-seq analysis showed that in the absence of antimicrobials the expression of oprd increased by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold in pars and parr mutants, respectively , similar to the effect of mutations observed in the presence of antimicrobials. however, the transcript levels of mexxy-oprm and arnbcadte-ugd were not appreciably different suggesting that the pars/parr system does not have a strong influence on these two operons in defined minimal medium. one possible reason is that the arnbcadte-ugd and mexxy operons were expressed at low levels in the wild type strain under our growth conditions. indeed, the log  values of arnbcadte-ugd and mexxy were  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively.

negative impact of the pars/parr system on phenazine production and motility
we noticed previously that the pars/parr system controls the production of the phenazine pyocyanin. especially in pigment-production medium , the pars and parr mutants produce more pyocyanin  than the wild-type . the impact of the deletion of pars or parr on phenazine production was quantified using chloroform extraction of cultures grown in ppmd medium followed by spectrophotometric assays as described previously  <cit> . the amount of phenazine produced by the pars and parr mutants was greater than two fold the amount produced by the wild-type strain . complementation of the mutants by introducing pars-parr in trans on a medium-copy-number vector reduced phenazine production below wild type levels, confirming its negative regulatory role in phenazine biosynthesis.

rhamnolipids are an essential component for p. aeruginosa swarming motility  <cit> . to determine whether the increased expression of rhamnolipid biosynthetic genes  resulted in increased motility in the mutant strains, swarming motility was assessed by inoculating bacterial cells on a motility plate  and measuring the diameter of the circle covered by bacterial cells for up to 36 h as described previously  <cit> . both pars and parr mutants exhibited enhanced motility compared with that of the wild type strain . these results suggest that the pars/parr system is a negative regulator of bacterial motility in p. aeruginosa.

qrt-pcr was used to verify phenazine- and motility-related gene expression in these bacterial strains, including phza <dig>  phza <dig>  phzm, rhla and rhlb, in ab medium + 2% caa at mid-logarithmic phase. expression of phza <dig>  phza <dig>  phzm, rhla and rhlb in the pars and parr mutants was up-regulated by 2– <dig> log , as compared to that of the wild type . these results further confirmed the regulatory roles of pars/parr on phenazine and motility genes.

discussion
in this study, we determined the transcript levels of all  <dig> of the annotated coding sequences within the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> genome. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative transcriptomic atlas of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  rna-seq analysis also identified genes regulated by pars and parr and linked the pars/parr tcst system to the well characterized mexef-oprn operon and the three quorum sensing systems. this linkage was not identified previously by transcriptomic analyses using microarrays to compare mutants to wild type under different growth conditions . hence, these results provide important clues toward understanding the complexity of the regulatory roles mediated by pars/parr in controlling drug resistance.

previous microarray studies identified  <dig> genes controlled by parr in the presence of 4 μg/ml indolicidin  <cit>  and  <dig> genes controlled by a point mutation  in the parr protein  <cit> . the two microarray studies shared  <dig> common genes including arnabcdef and  <dig> genes  encoding hypothetical proteins . the agreement between these studies in identifying genes within the arnbcadtef-ugd operon confirms the importance of parr in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide modification genes in the presence of antimicrobials. two of those genes arnf and pa <dig> also were identified as being pars/parr regulated in our study . since arnf and pa <dig> belong to the arnbcadtef-ugd and pa4473-pa <dig> operons, these data indicate that the influence of pars and parr on the two operons is weaker in the absence of antimicrobials. interestingly, data from all three studies indicate that pars/parr are responsible for the repression of the oprd gene  .

the  <dig> commonly regulated genes identified by our study and the indolicidin treatment studies included  <dig> genes that were suppressed by parr in both studies . these included are phza <dig>  phzb <dig>  phzs , norbcd , chic , lecb , pa <dig>  and  <dig> genes encoding hypothetical proteins. one gene pagl encoding a lipid a 3-o-deacylase was down-regulated in both studies. interestingly,  <dig> genes including pa0282- <dig> , pa <dig>  and pa <dig>  that were over-expressed in the parr mutant in this study, were down-regulated in the study using indolicidin. these results indicate that induction of a portion of parr-regulated genes depends on the environmental conditions.

it was reported that the mexef-oprn efflux pump produces specific transcriptional changes in p. aeruginosa regulatory networks  <cit> . since both the mexef-oprn efflux pump and qs systems were regulated by the pars/parr system, we compared our transcriptome data with those of the two studies that have contributed to define the mexef-oprn and qs regulons in p. aeruginosa <cit> . the comparison revealed that approximately 16% and 22% of the genes  that were differentially regulated by pars/parr belong to the mexef-oprn and qs regulons, respectively . a total of  <dig> genes were commonly regulated by the three systems . half of these genes  were classified as hypothetical or functionally unknown. other genes of interest included pqsabcde-phnab, hcnac , phzb <dig> , chic , lecb , clpp <dig> , lptf , mexh-opmd . another interesting feature was that all  <dig> genes were over-expressed in the pars/parr mutant. together, these results suggest that the pars/parr regulatory effects are partially mediated by the mexef-oprn and qs systems.

a total of  <dig> genes were specifically regulated by pars/parr and mexef-oprn, but not qs . among them,  <dig> genes were under-expressed in the pars/parr mutant including pagl, pncb <dig> , xenb , idh . pncb <dig> and xenb are enzymes involved in the degradation of nicotinate and trinitrotoluene , respectively  <cit> . another interestingly gene cluster was pa2811-pa <dig> encoding two abc transporter and a glutathione s-transferase . gsts constitute a large family of enzymes that catalyze the addition of glutathione to many toxic exogenous compounds  <cit> . the  <dig> genes that were over-expressed included oprd, nosfy , hpcb , hpaa , pa <dig> , nark <dig>  and pa <dig> . since the expression of mexef-oprn was activated by pars/parr; whereas the expression of pars or parr was not affected by mexef-oprn  <cit> , it is reasonable to speculate that the pars/parr system functions upstream of mexef-oprn. these results also suggest that the pars/parr system may control membrane permeability and detoxification genes through the positive control of the mexef-oprn efflux pump, but not through qs. a total of  <dig> genes were controlled by pars/parr and the qs systems, but not the mexef-oprn operon . consistent with the up-regulation of qs-controlled genes, the expression of rhli and rhlr was increased 2– <dig> fold in pars and parr mutants. the qs regulatory gene qtee was also in this group. some other noteworthy members of this group were genes encoding rnd efflux transporters , secondary metabolism genes , cytochrome c oxidases  and regulatory genes . these results suggest the possibility that the impact of pars and parr on qs is partially mediated by the rhlr/i system.

the lads gene encoding a two component sensor protein was expressed at high levels in both pars and parr mutants compared with the wild type . previous studies showed that the lads protein activates p. aeruginosa qs expression through the gacs/gaca two component system and the regulatory rna rsmz  <cit> . this observation linked the pars/parr system with the well-characterized gacs/gaca regulatory system. another gene, phzh encoding a phenazine terminal modifying enzyme, was also negatively regulated by the pars/parr system . phzh is a unique transamidase involved in the conversion of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid  to phenazine-1-carboxamide   <cit> . unlike phzm and phzs , which were positively controlled by qs, phzh was not regulated by the qs and mexef-oprn systems  <cit> . five genes  annotated as encoding components of a type ii secretion system  also were over-expressed  in the pars and parr mutants relative to the wild type, suggesting positive control by pars and parr . the t2ss is a secretory pathway for most extracellular proteins. although, these genes were not identified as targets for qs by the transcriptomic studies  <cit> , transcriptional fusion assays showed that their expression was influenced by the rhl and las qs systems  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
previous microarray studies demonstrated that the pars/parr tcst system controls the expression of the lipopolysaccharide modifying , efflux , porin , chitinase  and phenazine biosynthetic genes  when exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial reagents  <cit> . in this study, the major components of the pars/parr signal transduction pathway in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> were identified in bacteria grown without antimicrobials . significantly, we showed that the three qs regulatory genes, the gene cluster including the mexef-oprn efflux system, the lads sensor kinase and the quorum threshold expression element qtee were differentially regulated by the pars/parr system. the sensor kinase lads is an activator of the gacs/gaca two component system and it positively regulates the levels of las qs system through the titration of the translational regulatory protein rsma  <cit> . in contrast, expression of the qtee protein reduces lasr protein stability without affecting its expression  <cit> . finally, the mexef-oprn efflux pump is a transporter of the pqs precursor hhq and negatively controls the expression of the pqsabcde-phnab cluster  <cit> . these results indicate that the pars/parr system regulates qs at both transcriptional and translational levels through multiple mechanisms. since the expression of pars and parr is not controlled by qs or mexef-oprn, whereas both qs and mexef-oprn gene are regulated by pars and parr, we conclude that the pars/parr system is on the top of this hierarchical regulatory cascade.
