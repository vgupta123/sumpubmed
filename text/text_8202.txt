BACKGROUND
in recent years, substantial knowledge accumulated on the genetic consequences of the climatic oscillations in the quaternary for european and north american species . since the ice sheets repeatedly spread considerably southward on both continents during glacial periods , boreal and temperate biota were repeatedly pushed southward into isolated refugia and subsequently recolonized northward again. as a result, shallow genetic divergence  <cit>  and low genetic diversity  <cit>  are typical of various taxa in northern regions. in contrast, relatively deep dna divergences  <cit>  and higher genetic diversity  <cit>  occur in many taxa inhabiting temperate refugial areas in europe and north america, suggesting survival of these populations over several glacial periods. since the eastern palearctic and northwesternmost tip of north america are considered to have remained largely ice-free throughout the quaternary  <cit>  , deep dna divergences and high genetic diversity would also be expected in that region. however, even in the absence of ice sheets, the habitats in that region are believed to have been much affected by the climatic oscillations, and this is likely to have affected the distributions and consequently also the population dynamics of many animals.

several studies have dealt with the phylogeography of widespread northern palearctic animals, including mammals such as badger meles meles  <cit> , hares lepus spp.  <cit> , and various rodents  <cit> , as well as birds including ducks  <cit> , shorebirds <cit> , woodpeckers  <cit> , and several species of passerines  <cit> . most of these studies have reported little or no divergence over large areas of the northern palearctic, although some divergent clades, mostly dated to the pleistocene, have been found in some species. for example, a southeastern palearctic clade has been noted in several birds and mammals and also in an amphibian and two ants, suggesting common causes of their divergences . hewitt et al  <cit>  concluded that some arctic species have shallow genetic clades with coinciding geographical boundaries. some phylogeographical studies of birds have dealt with groups of closely related species with extensive north-south distributions from the taiga to temperate forests in central china and the himalayas, and some of these have found relatively deep divergences between boreal and more southern taxa, which date back to the pliocene or early pleistocene  <cit> .

the arctic warbler phylloscopus borealis is a small insectivorous passerine, which breeds in the boreal forests from northern scandinavia through siberia to alaska, south to northern mongolia, russian far east, northeasternmost china and japan  <cit>  . all populations winter in southeast asia, indonesia and the philippines  <cit> . this is the only species in the large genus phylloscopus that breeds in north america  <cit> . three to six morphologically subtly different subspecies are generally recognised, with much disagreement among authors  <cit>  . in the breeding season, it inhabits both coniferous, mixed and broad-leaved forest, and also bushes  on the tundra and above the tree limit; in japan it breeds in mountains up to  <dig> m  <cit> . a recent paper  <cit>  analysed mitochondrial nd <dig> sequence variation across a large part of the species' continental range , and found little divergence, except between kamchatka/sakhalin and the rest of the range, concordant with results from several other studies on other species as noted above  <cit> . the same study  <cit>  also found the haplotypes from northeast siberia and alaska to form a clade separated from the haplotypes from south siberia to northeast europe. moreover, the nucleotide diversity was highest in south siberia/northeast europe and lowest in alaska, with northeast siberia having intermediate values. it was concluded that the direction of postglacial colonization was likely from south siberia towards the northwest and northeast, with alaska being colonized in a stepping-stone pattern.

in this paper, we conduct a more extensive analysis of variation in mitochondrial dna  from  <dig> populations of the arctic warbler from across the species' range, including denser sampling from the previously poorly sampled kamchatka and sakhalin and the formerly unsampled japan, in order to examine:  the phylogeographic structure compared with other boreal species, with the specific hypothesis that the eastern palearctic/northwesternmost nearctic populations might show deep divergences as a result of long-time survival in a region which has been less affected by ice during the pleistocene than other parts of the holarctic;  whether the genetic diversity is high throughout this part of the range, as in many species inhabiting unglaciated temperate refugial regions in europe and north america; and  whether latitudinal trends in genetic diversity and signs of population expansions are lacking, unlike in european and north american species inhabiting formerly glaciated areas.

RESULTS
phylogeny and divergence times
forty-two cytochrome b haplotypes were identified among the  <dig> individuals from  <dig> populations  based on  <dig> polymorphic sites . according to the amova,  <dig> % of the variance is attributable to within-population variation and  <dig> % to among-population variation.

n = total sample size. ala = alaska; ana = anadyr; mag = magadan; csh = central siberia ; wsh = western siberia ; kam = kamchatka; sak = sakhalin; hok = hokkaido; iwa = iwate; yam = yamanashi; shi = shizuoka; nar = nara; ehi = ehime; oit = oita. see figure  <dig> 

in the cytochrome b tree comprising all samples  the arctic warbler is divided into three main, strongly supported clades . these represent separate geographical locations: clade a - alaska and mainland eurasia ; clade b - kamchatka, sakhalin and hokkaido; and clade c - honshu, shikoku and kyushu . in the beast and bootstrap analyses, clades a and b are inferred to be sisters, although with low support , whereas in the mrbayes analysis  clades a and c are inferred to be sisters, although with effectively no support . within clades a, b and c there is no correlation between the inferred relationships of the sequences and their geographical locations, except that the sequences from northeast siberia and alaska form a well supported clade both in the beast  and mrbayes analyses  .

in the tree estimated from the concatenated nd5-cytochrome b-control region-nd6-12s-trna sequences  the samples representing clades a and b are recovered as sisters, with 100% parsimony and maximum likelihood bootstrap support and somewhat lower posterior probability.

the estimated ages of the main clades differ among the analyses. in the analyses with a fixed clock rate of  <dig> % per million years  the mean age of the split between clades a/b and c is inferred to be  <dig>  or  <dig>  my, i.e. in the early pleistocene or late pliocene, respectively, and between clades a and b  <dig>  or  <dig>  my, i.e. in the early pleistocene . the analyses employing a lognormal uncorrelated relaxed clock with a fixed mean rate result in ages with large differences in means  and confidence intervals of up to  <dig>  my . we conclude that a relaxed clock prior is unsuitable for our data in the absence of independent information, such as fossils, that can help us define a strong prior on the time to most recent common ancestor.

estimated by bayesian inference using the gtr + Γ model and a fixed clock rate of  <dig>  per lineage/million years, and a coalescent expansion growth model  or birth-death model . values in square brackets are 95% highest posterior density intervals.

the estimated mean ages of the deepest splits within clades a, b and c are approximately  <dig> - <dig>  mya , although most divergences are much shallower .

population genetics and demography
within each clade, some populations share haplotypes: e.g., haplotype a <dig> is found in alaska and magadan ; haplotypes b <dig> and b <dig> in kamchatka and sakhalin, b <dig> in kamchatka and hokkaido, and b <dig> in sakhalin and hokkaido ; and haplotypes c <dig> in iwate, yamanashi, shizuoka and ehime  . haplotype diversity  and nucleotide diversity  are shown in table  <dig>  overall haplotype diversity  and nucleotide diversity  are high. however, within the three main clades the mean diversity estimates are lower, especially the nucleotide diversity , and the differences among clades a-c are not significant . there are no latitudinal trends in haplotype and nucleotide diversity within the three main clades . however, diversity estimates in peripheral populations within the main clades are relatively low .

see table  <dig> for localities included in central siberia and west siberia, respectively, and figure  <dig> for geographical locations.

the pairwise fst values for the localities for which our sample sizes are ≥ <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  fst values are higher between clades a, b and c  than within these main clades . the highest value is between hokkaido  and iwate , which are only approximately  <dig> km apart. the fst value between alaska and magadan is  <dig> , and significantly different, despite the sharing of one haplotype. combining samples from localities with small sample sizes with geographically adjacent localities  yield very similar results.

only populations with sample sizes of ≥ <dig> are included. the different styles  represent pairwise fst values among the three main clades  in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  all comparisons are significant .

the tajima's d values of all three major clades are negative , which suggests sudden population expansions, although only that of clade c is significant. in addition, fu's fs are negative, with significant p-values for all three main clades , again suggesting past population expansions.

discussion
phylogeny, divergence times and comparison with north america
the three main clades are highly divergent and well supported, and are estimated to have diverged around the pliocene/pleistocene border. the combined sequence data provide reasonably strong support for a sister relationship between the two northerly distributed clades .

weir & schluter  <cit>  found, based on an extensive survey of new world species, that 100% of boreal north american members of superspecies coalesced during the pleistocene, in contrast to 56% of sub-boreal and 46% of tropical superspecies. a similar latitudinal trend of divergence times has been found in north american fishes: clades occupying formerly glaciated areas are generally of pleistocene origin  <cit> , whereas more southerly distributed clades usually predate the pleistocene  <cit> . the separation of the three main arctic warbler clades in the pliocene or early pleistocene is older than the divergences of closely related species from formerly ice-covered boreal regions of north america, but in agreement with species pairs from temperate north american and neotropical regions  <cit>   .

several other studies suggest that sister species of boreal eastern palearctic forest birds might be on average older than their new world counterparts. boreal eastern palearctic sister species of phylloscopus warblers are estimated to have diverged between mid-pliocene and mid-pleistocene  <cit> . the widely distributed boreal parus montanus separated from the eastern palearctic parus affinis around the pliocene-pleistocene border  <cit> . in a clade of boreal mainly eastern palearctic emberiza buntings, uncorrected cytochrome b divergences are  <dig> - <dig> %  <cit> , indicating separation during the pliocene . two species of erithacus robins, one endemic to japan and one occurring in japan and on sakhalin, are estimated to have separated from their mainland relatives  <dig> - <dig>  mya, during the pliocene or early pleistocene  <cit> . in contrast, nylander et al.  <cit>  inferred that most palearctic thrush turdus spp. sister species, several of which have boreal eastern palearctic distributions, separated in the mid to late pleistocene .

the generally older ages of boreal sister species in the eastern palearctic than in north america could be due to lower recent speciation rates or lower extinction rates in the eastern palearctic . weir & schluter  <cit>  concluded that the fragmentation of forests by ice sheets during the pleistocene was the main cause of the elevated rates of diversification of forest birds in boreal regions compared to sub-boreal and tropical new world regions. it is possible that forest habitats were less fragmented in the eastern palearctic than in north america during the pleistocene , causing less subdivision of forest bird populations and hence less divergence. alternatively, the less severe conditions in the eastern palearctic than in northern north america, e.g.  <cit>  might have facilitated long-term survival of already separated lineages.

distributional patterns
the three major arctic warbler lineages have apparently maintained their integrity through several successive glaciations, with little or no mixing, despite likely shifts and contractions of their breeding ranges and shared winter distributions. the divergence between clade c and the common ancestor of clades a and b is here postulated to have occurred between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya. this coincides with the climate crash associated with the final closure of the panama isthmus at  <dig>  mya. northern hemisphere ice sheets expanded, and there was a global tendency toward a more arid climate, causing among other things decreasing and fragmented forest cover  <cit> . during the last glacial maximum,  <dig> 000- <dig>  <dig> years ago, the northwesternmost part of the present range of the arctic warbler was glaciated, while the rest of northern eurasia and northwesternmost north america was arid and tree-less, with polar desert or steppe-tundra conditions at least in higher-elevation areas, e.g.  <cit> . parts of china and japan are believed to have been forested  <cit> . accordingly, the conditions were probably unsuitable for arctic warblers in much of its current range. however, since the arctic warbler can thrive in scrub on tundra further north than practically all other warblers  <cit> , it is possible that it could have occurred at least locally within part of its present range. it seems probable that it could have remained in japan throughout the glacial periods. based on the current breeding distributions and the fact that all arctic warblers winter in southeast asia, the philippines and indonesia  <cit> , it seems likely that all three major lineages have survived the glaciations in eastern asia. reeves et al.  <cit>  found evidence of gene flow in continental eurasian/alaskan populations of arctic warblers  from south siberia towards the northwest and northeast, and concluded that this pattern probably indicates the routes of postglacial expansion.

although we do not know for sure in which areas the three arctic warbler clades diverged, the combined sequence data strongly suggest that first a lineage comprising the two northern clades  separated from a common ancestor with the southern clade , whose distribution probably included japan, and later the two northern clades separated from each other. this scenario makes sense also from a geographical point of view, since the ancestry of the clade including the arctic warbler is inferred to have been somewhat further south  <cit> . the very short internode leading up to the clade comprising a and b indicates that all three lineages separated close in time. a similar "simultaneous" burst of lineage splittings has been suggested for a clade of mainly eastern palearctic boreal emberiza buntings  <cit> .

several species groups and phylogroups of birds and mammals have distributional patterns that agree fairly well with that of the arctic warbler, suggesting that geographical barriers leading to vicariant divergence of populations have existed in the past between, on the one hand, much of the northern palearctic and, on the other hand, russian far east  and japan, and on a finer scale within the latter area, between sakhalin/southern kamchatka/hokkaido and the rest of japan. some of these divergences may have been caused by pleistocene climatic oscillations, while others are apparently older and must have other causes. the importance of the tsugaru strait, "blakiston's line", between hokkaido and honshu as a biogeographic division line in various taxa of animals and plants has been stressed by  <cit> . several of the birds breeding in japan and, in some cases, also on sakhalin and southern kamchatka have their closest relatives in the boreal forests on the mainland  <cit> . three of these  differ from their respective sister species by c.  <dig> - <dig> % in cytochrome b . this is similar to the differences among the three main arctic warbler clades , suggesting common causes of their divergences. in addition, several bird and mammal species show relatively deep divergences between a clade covering much of the northern palearctic and a clade from the russian far east  and in some cases japan  <cit> . however, these divergences are of more recent origin than the arctic warbler clades, and probably all date to the pleistocene.

despite apparent historical range shifs, it is possible that the three main arctic warbler clades have diverged in complete geographical isolation. there is presently no known geographical overlap between them, although the parts of kamchatka and continental russian far east where this might occur are unsampled. the present study indicates significant divergence between some geographically closely situated localities within the main clades, even in the absence of apparent geographical barriers. reeves et al.  <cit>  also reported significant isolation-by-distance in arctic warblers in continental eurasia/alaska. presumably, the natal philopatry is strong and the innate migration routes strictly adhered to, which has been suggested to be at least part of the explanation for the maintenance of geographically neighbouring clades in the boreal migratory willow warbler phylloscopus trochilus  <cit> , greenish warbler phylloscous trochiloides complex  <cit>  and dunlin calidris alpina  <cit> .

population expansions
within each of the three main clades, the nucleotide diversity is low , especially in the marginal populations from iwate , hokkaido  and alaska  , and neutrality tests indicate sudden population expansion in each of these clades. these results suggest that each clade has suffered from past bottlenecks, and that the range of each of them has expanded in more recent times. there is observational data supporting recent expansion in at least one area: the arctic warbler was only recently confirmed to breed in hokkaido, on the shiretoko peninsula  <cit> . reeves et al.  <cit>  also found evidence of population expansion in arctic warblers in northeast siberia/alaska, while they inferred more stable populations in south and west siberia and north europe. although they did not find any signature of population expansion in the west siberian and european populations, these populations must have expanded their ranges considerably during the holocene, since their present breeding areas were coverd by ice during the latest glaciation. reeves et al.  <cit>  further deduced that beringia was likely colonized in two steps, first from south siberia to northeast russia and then, after a delay, across the bering strait to alaska.

a similar pattern of post-pleistocene population expansion has been found in another forest bird, the great tit parus major complex. the northern major  and eastern minor  groups show signs of population expansion, unlike the central asian bokharensis and south asian cinereus groups  <cit> . it is most likely that the northern major group was forced to retreat south to escape from the advancing ice during the glacial periods, and that at the same time the east asian minor group probably also had to reduce its range due to habitat changes resulting from the colder and drier climate. evidence of population expansion has been found in several other widely distributed boreal forest taxa, including seven more birds, two rodents, a flying squirrel, a newt and two ants .

the results suggest that although the eastern palearctic may have been almost free of ice during the pleistocene, population bottlenecks and subsequent expansions have nevertheless occurred in that region because of forest dynamics.

CONCLUSIONS
the three arctic warbler clades are estimated to have diverged in close succession during the latter part of the pliocene to early part of the pleistocene, and although all of them experienced population bottlenecks during the pleistocene, they nevertheless survived and maintained their respective integrity. suitable breeding habitats likely existed in east asia, probably at least partly within the present breeding ranges of these lineages, e.g. japan. several other clades of northeastern palearctic forest birds are noted to have diversified in the late pliocene. this pattern differs from that of north american boreal forest clades that occur on formerly glaciated ground, and which are generally of pleistocene origin. the differences between these regions could be due to slower speciation rates in the eastern palearctic due to less fragmentation of forest habitats during glacial periods, or to longer survival of eastern palearctic clades as a result of less severe conditions in that region compared to northern north america. several other palearctic organisms show concordant biogeographical patterns to that of the arctic warbler, indicating common causes of their diversifications.
