BACKGROUND
rhodosporidium toruloides is a β-carotenoid accumulating oleaginous yeast in subphylum pucciniomycotina <cit> . able to accumulate more than 70% of its dry cell mass as triacylgleride with similar chemical composition to those of plants from ultra-high density fermentation  <cit> , r. toruloides is regarded as a great host with vast biotechnological potential to produce single cell oil, which may find wide spread applications in staple food, animal feed, biodiesel, surfactant and raw material for industrial polymers  <cit> . although studies have been done to optimize lipid yield through high-density fermentation  <cit> , there are scarce reports on the rational genetic engineering to improve lipid accumulation or fatty acid profiles in r. toruloides. to date, there are no reverse genetic studies reported in r. toruloides. with the advent of efficient and stable transformation method established using agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation  in r. toruloides <cit> , reverse genetic studies should become a real possibility.

targeted gene deletion, often referred as targeted gene knockout, is an essential tool for genetic engineering and reverse genetics. this is an important cornerstone to make any strains commercially competitive  <cit> . while targeted gene integration in model microorganisms, such as saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe, can be done with ease and high efficiency  <cit> , it is a major obstacle in many industrially important species such as r. toruloides.

it has been proposed that dna repair of double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination  and non-homologous end-joining  operate competitively  <cit> , and the predominance of nhej over hr has been regarded as the main cause of low gene targeting efficiency in fungi  <cit> . correspondingly, one strategy to deal with low gene targeting efficiency in fungi is to improve the hr pathway  <cit> . the other strategy is to inhibit or eliminate the nhej pathway, thereby forcing the transformed dna to be integrated via hr. with this approach, the frequency of hr has been found to be significantly improved with many reports of success in recent years through the disruption of nhej pathway by deleting one or more of its key components  <cit> . in eukaryotes, the main component of the nhej system is the dna-dependent protein kinase , a three-protein complex consisting of the dna-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit  and the regulatory dna-binding subunits, the ku70/ <dig> heterodimer  <cit> . the ku heterodimer is an abundant nonspecific dna-binding protein comprising of two tightly-associated subunits of about  <dig> and 83 kda, named ku <dig> and ku <dig> respectively  <cit> . both proteins exist in organisms ranging from fungi to human, and are arguably the defining proteins of nhej because of their sequence conservation  <cit> .

here, we report the isolation and characterization of ku <dig> and ku <dig> homologs in r. toruloides and the evaluation of a ku70-deficient mutant strain generated for improving gene deletion efficiency in r. toruloides.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of ku <dig> and ku <dig> encoding genes in r. toruloides
putative genes encoding the ku <dig> and ku <dig> homologues in the rhodotorula glutinis atcc  <dig>  genome were identified by tblastn search against the r. glutinis atcc  <dig> genome database at ncbi using the ustilago maydis ku <dig> and ku <dig> sequences as the query . 5′ and 3′ races were performed to obtain the full-length cdna sequences. the ku <dig> cdna contains a  <dig> -nt open reading frame  flanked by 57-nt and 99-nt 5′ and 3′ untranslated region  respectively, while the ku <dig> cdna contains a  <dig> -nt orf with 76-nt 5′ utr and 83-nt 3′ utr. comparison of the cdnas with the genomic sequences revealed that the ku <dig> mrna spans over  <dig>  bp containing  <dig> exons separated by  <dig> introns, whereas the ku <dig> mrna spans over  <dig>  bp containing  <dig> exons separated by  <dig> introns . all intronic sequences conformed strictly to the gt-ag rule  <cit> , with a gc content of approximately 61%, which is not significantly different to that of exonic sequences . sequencing of the  <dig>  bp ku <dig> genomic region in r. toruloides atcc  <dig> revealed 100% identity to that of r. toruloides atcc  <dig>  a comparison with a number of other fungal homologues are shown in table  <dig>  which shows that r. toruloides ku <dig> and ku <dig> genes have the highest gc content and highest density of introns .

the ku <dig> orf sequence was predicted to encode for a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. ku <dig> showed 25% to 30% identities to those from homo sapiens, neurospora crassa, aspergillus niger and cryptococcus neoformans, with the n. crassa ku <dig> being the closest homologue . analysis of ku <dig> against the superfamily database  <cit>  revealed a ku <dig> core domain  that is flanked by a n-terminal “von willebrand” a -like domain , and a c-terminal sap domain . the high sequence similarity and presence of signature domains conserved among ku <dig> homologues suggest that the characterized ku <dig> would be the key component of the nhej pathway in r. toruloides.

targeted gene deletion in wild type r. toruloides and generation of ku <dig> null mutants
to see whether targeted gene deletion could be achieved in wild type r. toruloides, ku <dig> was used as the first deletion target. a derivative of r. toruloides atcc  <dig> , which contained a 17β-estradiol inducible cre recombinase gene stably integrated into the genome and allowed the recycling of hygromycin selection marker, was used in atmt using the ku <dig> deletion construct, pkoku <dig> . eight candidates out of  <dig> transformants were screened for loss of the targeted deletion region as judged by multiplex pcr . further investigation using southern blot analysis demonstrated that  <dig> out of  <dig> candidates were true ku <dig> deletion mutants without ectopic integration . the mutant in lane  <dig> was therefore named Δku <dig> 

gene deletion frequency was improved in the ∆ku <dig> mutant
while the deletion of ku <dig> was obtained with a relatively high frequency , deletion of the mating-type specific gene ste <dig> and orotidine 5-phosphate decarboxylase gene ura <dig> <cit>  proved to be very difficult . the low deletion frequency of ste <dig> and ura <dig> highlighted a need for an improved gene deletion system. to investigate if the Δku <dig> strain generated earlier could be utilized for this purpose, the hygromycin selection cassette  was excised to generate a marker-free r. toruloides ku70-deficient derivative  by activating the cre recombinase using human hormone 17β-estradiol . as we found that high percentage of 5-fluoroorotic acid  resistant transformants were not true deletion mutants of ura <dig> previouly, we decided to evaluate the deletion of car <dig> homologue as a fast assay for gene deletion frequency because it encodes a bifunctional protein catalyzing phytoene synthase and carotene cyclase that is essential in the biosynthesis of β-carotene  <cit> .

using u. maydis car <dig>  <cit>  as a query for tblastn search against the r. toruloides atcc  <dig> genome database, a dna fragment sharing high sequence homology to the query  was identified. car <dig> was successfully amplified using dna template of r. toruloides atcc  <dig> using oligos rt <dig> and rt <dig>  as expected, albino transformants was observed when wt was transformed with the car <dig> knockout construct pkocar <dig> , and the color phenotype of transformants were stable after several rounds of subcultures . multiplex pcr and southern blot analysis further confirmed that all albino transformants tested were true car <dig> null mutants . the albino phenotype was directly caused by the deletion of car <dig> because the phenotype was completely restored when re-integrating a wild type gene fragment . whereas the targeted deletion frequency for car <dig> was estimated to be  <dig> % in wt, it was increased to  <dig> % in the ∆ku70e background, a more than 7-fold improvement. dramatically increased gene deletion frequencies were also observed at both ste <dig> and ura <dig> loci , with the deletions verified by southern blot and phenotypic analyses .

effect of homology sequence length on deletion frequency
to understand the effects of homology sequence length on gene deletion frequency, pkocar <dig> was modified to have various lengths of homology sequence, ranging from  <dig> to 1500 bp . the minimum homology length necessary for car <dig> deletion in wt was at least 250 bp with a gene deletion frequency of  <dig> %, while only 100 bp was sufficient in the ∆ku70e strain, which gave gene deletion frequency of approximately 20%. homology length of at least 1 kb was required to achieve gene deletion frequency of more than 90% using the ∆ku70e strain .

sensitivity of ku <dig> deficient mutant to dna damaging agents
deficiency in ku complex encoding genes have been linked to elevated sensitivity to dna-damaging agents due to the defects in dna repair  <cit> . as expected, the ∆ku <dig> strain displayed higher susceptibility to dna damage induced by methyl methane sulfonate  and exposure to ultraviolet  radiation compared to wt. the growth of both strains was repressed when mms concentration and uv radiation reached  <dig> % and 200 j/m <dig> respectively . however, the ku70-deficient strain showed no obvious growth defects under normal growth conditions and its cell morphology was indistinguishable from wt. in addition, there were no significant differences in sugar consumption rate and fatty acid profile between wt and ∆ku <dig> .

discussion
with more than 60% gc content, the ku <dig> and ku <dig> characterized here present the most gc-rich genes in the nhej-pathway reported so far. in terms of gene structure, both genes contain much higher density of introns than those of y. lipolytica , which is the best-studied oleaginous yeast to date. not surprisingly, homologues of c. neoformans, which is under the same basidiomycota phylum, also have high density of introns .

dsb repair can differ in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions of the genome and histone modifying factors play an important role in this process  <cit> . recombination frequencies are known to vary in different genes even when assayed with the same technique and in the same genetic background  <cit> . impairment of the nhej-pathway has proved to be effective in improving homologous recombination frequency in many eukaryotic hosts. however, the magnitude of improvement appears to vary considerably in different reports. with a homology sequence of approximately 750 bp, the car <dig> deletion frequency was improved  <dig> -fold, from  <dig> %, in wt to  <dig> % in the ku70-deficient mutant in r. toruloides. this is similar to the deletion of trp <dig> in y. lipolytica although substantially higher knockout frequencies have been reported for several genes in other fungi, for example, n. crassa, a. niger and c. neoformans . nevertheless, the r. toruloides ste <dig> gene remained very difficult to knockout even with the ∆ku70e mutant . this demonstrates a positional effect and implies additional factors that regulate gene deletion in r. toruloides. as the ste <dig> gene is located between the mating type loci rha <dig> and rha <dig> in r. toruloides <cit> , it is possible that the gene is within a transcriptionally silenced chromatin as was reported for the mating type genes in a number of other fungi  <cit> . the low deletion frequency of ste <dig> suggests a potential role of chromatin structure and/or gene expression level in regulating dna recombination in r. toruloides.

one of the drawbacks of nhej-deficient strains is its elevated sensitivity to dna damage and the possibility of generating unwanted mutations  <cit> . indeed, the ku70-deficient strain studied here showed increased sensitivity to mms and uv radiation. however, the mutant did not show severe growth defects under normal growth conditions. with comparable sugar consumption rate and fatty acid profile to the wt, the ∆ku <dig> and ∆ku70e strains should maintain much of the appeal of r. toruloides in industrial applications.

CONCLUSIONS
the ku70-deficient mutant generated herein was found to be effective in improving gene deletion frequency and retained the key oleaginous and fast growing features of r. toruloides. the strain should facilitate both fundamental and applied studies in this important yeast, with the approaches taken here likely to be applicable in other species in subphylum pucciniomycotina.
