BACKGROUND
canine oral malignant melanoma is a biologically aggressive tumor with a reported metastatic rate of up to 90%  <cit> . local disease can be treated with surgery and coarse-fractionated radiation therapy, with success dependent on location and stage  <cit> . despite options for local control most dogs will eventually die of metastatic disease  <cit> . similar to the case with human malignant melanoma, the use of traditional chemotherapy agents, such carboplatin and cisplatin, has little impact on both the primary tumor and metastatic disease, with no substantial survival benefit  <cit> . other treatment strategies, such as immunotherapy using a variety of vaccine based approaches, including the commercially available xenogeneic melanoma vaccine , have been explored as options for the management of canine malignant melanoma  <cit> . while the oncept vaccine was proven to be safe and preliminary data indicated that it significantly enhanced survival when used in the setting of loco-regional control,  <cit>  a recent retrospective clinical study failed to replicate these findings dogs with oral melanoma that had loco-regional tumor control  <cit> . there is also limited data in which small molecule inhibitors such as toceranib phosphate  have been used to treat this disease in dogs, although formal data regarding efficacy is lacking  <cit> . therefore, new therapeutic approaches to treatment are needed.

recently, the protein exportin  <dig>  has been validated as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. xpo <dig> is one of seven known nuclear export proteins responsible for shuttling cargo from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  <cit> . it is a member of the karyopherin β family of transport receptors that binds over  <dig> target proteins through a hydrophobic leucine-rich nuclear export signal  present in the cargo  <cit> . xpo <dig> is the sole nuclear exporter of several major tumor suppressor and growth regulatory proteins , including p <dig>  p <dig>  rb, p <dig>  p <dig>  stat <dig>  foxo and iκb among others  <cit> . there is now substantial data demonstrating that xpo <dig> is upregulated in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors  <cit> . furthermore, overexpression of xpo <dig> correlates with a poor prognosis in many human cancers, indicating that changes in nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking resulting in aberrant localization of key proteins can contribute to cancer development and progression.

given the role of xpo <dig> dysregulation in cancer, there has been great interest in developing inhibitors of this protein. recently, novel orally bioavailable, small-molecule selective inhibitor of nuclear export  compounds that specifically bind to xpo <dig> at the reactive site cys  <dig> residue have been developed and tested both in vitro and in vivo <cit> . sine compounds induce apoptosis and block proliferation in several cancer cell lines, including those derived from colon  <cit> , pancreas  <cit> , and breast carcinomas  <cit>  as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia   <cit> , while sparing normal cells  <cit> . additional studies have shown potent anti-cancer activity and good tolerability of sine in vivo using mouse human xenograft  models of pancreatic cancer  <cit> , renal cancer  <cit> , cll  <cit> , mantle cell lymphoma   <cit> , multiple myeloma  <cit>  and acute myelogenous leukemia   <cit> . early clinical trials of the sine kpt- <dig>  have demonstrated biologic activity of xpo <dig> inhibition in human lymphoid malignancies.

the sine compound kpt- <dig>  has been previously evaluated in canine lymphoma cell lines and found to have good activity in the low nanomolar range  <cit> . additionally, a phase i clinical trial of kpt- <dig> in dogs with primarily lymphoma demonstrated evidence of single agent activity consisting of both partial response to therapy and stable disease for over 4 weeks with excellent tolerability over long-term dosing. lastly, data generated in both healthy dogs and dogs with cancer indicate that kpt- <dig> exhibits good oral bioavailability with an average cmax of approximately 250 ng/ml and an average auc of 1800 ng/ml  <cit> . the purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity of kpt- <dig> against established canine malignant melanoma cell lines as a prelude to future testing in dogs with metastatic melanoma.

methods
cell lines and reagents
canine melanoma cell lines mel  <dig>  mel  <dig>  mel  <dig> and mel  <dig> were generously provided by michael s. kent   <cit> . three of the lines  were derived from a primary oral tumor and mel  <dig> was generated from a metastatic lymph node. the cell lines were maintained in rpmi  <dig> supplemented with 10% fbs, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine, and hepes -1-piperazineethanesolfonic acid) at 35°c, supplemented with 5% co₂. kpt- <dig>  was dissolved in dmso to generate stock solutions for use in vitro. the following antibodies were used for western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments: anti-p <dig>  anti-p <dig>  anti-xpo <dig>  and anti- β-actin .

cell proliferation assay
melanoma cells  were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates overnight in 10% fbs supplemented media and incubated with dmso or increasing concentrations of kpt- <dig>  after  <dig> or 96 hours, the medium was removed and the plates were frozen at −80°c overnight before processing using the cyquant® cell proliferation assay kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cell proliferation was calculated as a percentage of the dmso-treated control wells and ic₅₀ values were derived after plotting proliferation values on a logarithmic curve. each experiment was repeated  <dig> times.

assessment of apoptosis
the ability of kpt- <dig> to induce apoptosis in treated cells was assessed using annexin v/propidium iodide  staining as previously described  <cit> . briefly,  <dig>  ×  <dig> canine melanoma cells were treated with  <dig> % dmso,  <dig>  μm kpt- <dig>  or 1 μm kpt- <dig> for 96 hours at 37°c. cells were collected, washed, and stained with annexin v–fluorescein isothiocyanate and pi for 15 minutes before evaluation by flow cytometry on a becton dickinson facs caliber. each experiment was repeated  <dig> times.

immunoblotting
melanoma cells  in 10% fbs medium were treated with dmso,  <dig>  μm or 1 μm kpt- <dig> for  <dig> or 24 hours. protein lysates were prepared and quantified, separated by sds-page, and western blotting was performed using previously described methods  <cit> . the membranes were incubated overnight with anti-xpo <dig>  anti-p <dig> or anti-p <dig> antibodies, then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase linked secondary antibodies, washed, and exposed to substrate . blots were stripped, washed, and reprobed for β-actin.

quantitative rt-pcr
total rna was extracted from canine melanoma cells that were cultured in 10% fbs supplemented medium for  <dig> or 24 hours with dmso,  <dig>  μm or 1 μm kpt- <dig>  using trizol . cdna was made from 2 μg of total rna using superscript iii , followed by real-time pcr with taqman-specific probes  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. real-time pcr for xpo <dig> was performed using the applied biosystems stepone plus detection system and mic- <dig> and p <dig> expression was detected using the viia™  <dig> real-time pcr system . normalization was performed relative to 18s rrna. all reactions were performed in triplicate and included no-template controls for each gene. relative gene expression for all real-time pcr data was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method  <cit> .

immunofluorescence
cells were plated in a  <dig> well plate with poly-lysine coated coverslips  then treated with dmso or 1 μm kpt- <dig>  they were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with  <dig> % triton-x. next, the cells were blocked at room temperature in blocking buffer  for 30 minutes and then were incubated with anti-p <dig> or anti-p <dig> for 1 hour at room temperature. a secondary fitc labeled anti-rabbit or anti-goat antibody was applied for 30 minutes, as appropriate . cells were also stained with dapi to visualize the nucleus . intracellular localization of proteins was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using an olympus fv <dig> spectral confocal microscope.

clonogenic assay
melanoma cell lines were grown in flasks until 80% confluent, then collected, washed and plated at  <dig>  cells per well in six-well plates. after 24 hours the cells were treated with dmso, 1 nm, 10nm,  <dig>  μm, 1 μm or 10 μm kpt  <dig> and incubated at 35°c, supplemented with 5% co₂ for 7 days. cells were then fixed with methanol/acetic acid , washed with pbs and stained with crystal violet . the surviving cell fraction was defined as the number of colonies counted divided by the number of cells that were plated in the treated groups and then normalized to the plating efficiency. plating efficiency was defined as the number of colonies divided by the number of cells plated in the untreated group  <cit> . vehicle control treated mel  <dig> and  <dig> cells served as the plating efficiency control group. experiments were performed in triplicate.

statistics
all experiments were performed  <dig> times and/or performed in triplicate. a mean and standard deviation was derived from all repeated experiments. the apoptosis assays and clonogenic assays were evaluated using a student’s t-test to compare treated groups to vehicle control. a one-way anova comparison test was used to evaluate differences in gene expression among the kpt- <dig> treated and vehicle control treated groups for the quantitative rt-pcr assays and to compare multiple treatment groups in the cell proliferation assays. values of p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

ethical support
all the studies we performed were in vitro with cell lines and as such, no iacuc or approval was necessary. the cell lines have been available for several years and have been used in prior publications.

RESULTS
kpt- <dig> inhibits the proliferation of canine melanoma cell lines
to assess whether kpt- <dig> was capable of inhibiting the proliferation of canine melanoma cells, the tumor cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of kpt- <dig> and the cyquant assay was used to assess relative cell numbers after 96 hours of culture. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  proliferation of all cell lines was significantly inhibited at concentrations in the nanomolar range. the ic₅₀ values for the various cell lines ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  μm.

xpo <dig> inhibition induces apoptosis of canine melanoma cell lines
to determine if inhibition of xpo <dig> resulted in apoptosis of canine melanoma cell lines, cells were treated with dmso,  <dig>  μm kpt- <dig> or 1 μm kpt- <dig> for 96 hours. following collection, they were stained with markers of early  and late  apoptosis and then analyzed by flow cytometry. figure  <dig> demonstrates that treated cells exhibited significant increases in early and late apoptosis when compare to the vehicle control in the  <dig>  μm and 1 μm treatment group, with the exception of mel  <dig> which only had a significant increase in late apoptosis in the 1 μm treatment group.

colony formation is inhibited by kpt-335
mel  <dig> and mel  <dig> previously have been demonstrated to exhibit colony formation in culture and inhibition of colony growth has been used as a tool to assess the effects of various treatments including rapamycin, nutilin- <dig> and dna damaging agents on these canine melanoma cell lines  <cit> . to determine whether blocking xpo <dig> function would impair the formation of colonies, mel  <dig> and mel  <dig> cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with dmso or kpt- <dig> and evaluated daily. after 7 days of culture the plates were collected and colonies were counted following staining with crystal violet. a significant inhibition of colony formation occurred in cells exposed to >  <dig> nm of drug when compared to vehicle control .

kpt- <dig> downregulates xpo <dig> protein expression while inducing a concomitant increase in xpo <dig> mrna
previous work has shown that xpo <dig> inhibition by sine compounds results in loss of target protein, while simultaneously inducing upregulation of xpo <dig> gene expression  <cit> . furthermore, increased expression of xpo <dig> mrna has been used as a pharmacodynamic marker in people treated with the closely related sine compound kpt- <dig>   <cit> . to determine whether kpt- <dig> has a similar effect on xpo <dig> in canine melanoma cell lines, cells were incubated with dmso or kpt- <dig> at  <dig>  μm or 1 μm for  <dig> and 24 hours. figure 4a demonstrates a time and dose dependent loss of protein expression in treated cells. concordant with results in human cell lines, xpo <dig> mrna was similarly upregulated in the melanoma cells following incubation with kpt- <dig> for 24 hours , demonstrating a compensatory response to loss of xpo <dig> protein.

kpt- <dig> modulates the expression of p <dig> and its downstream targets and localization of p <dig> and p <dig> in canine melanoma cell lines
consistent with previous work, only  <dig> of the  <dig> lines expressed p <dig> protein  <cit> . kpt- <dig> treatment enhanced p <dig> expression in two of these lines after 24 hours of culture . quantitative rt-pcr showed that expression of the targets p <dig> and mic- <dig> was significantly upregulated after canine melanoma cell lines were treated with dmso or kpt- <dig> at  <dig>  μm or 1 μm for 4 hours  or 24 hours  . mel  <dig> was collected at an earlier time point because this cell line grew at a much faster rate than the other lines so overgrowth in the vehicle control group was a problem at later time points of collection. mic- <dig> was only significantly increased in mel  <dig> and mel  <dig>  similarly, p <dig> was expressed in  <dig> of the  <dig> lines and exposure to kpt- <dig> increased its expression. evaluation of nuclear versus cytoplasmic protein in treated cells revealed that with drug treatment both p <dig> and p <dig> expression were increased primarily in the nucleus, although levels were somewhat enhanced in the cytoplasm as well . lastly, confocal microscopy confirmed that p <dig> and p <dig> did demonstrate enhanced nuclear localization after kpt- <dig> treatment in mel  <dig> and mel  <dig> .

discussion
unlike malignant melanoma in humans which occurs primarily in the skin and is typically associated with exposure to uv irradiation, malignant melanoma in dogs occurs primarily in the oral cavity and nail beds  <cit> . approximately 60% of human cutaneous melanomas possess activating mutations in the cytoplasmic kinase braf whereas these mutations are not found in the canine disease  <cit> . in both dogs and people, standard chemotherapy agents do not have substantial activity in either the primary disease or in the setting of metastasis  <cit> . while there are significant differences that exist between the clinical presentation and molecular biology of human and canine malignant melanoma, two recent review articles demonstrated that the diseases do share similar histopathologic features as well as alterations in both akt and mapk signaling pathways, with ras and pten mutations present in tumors from both species  <cit> .

in human patients with melanomas that carry braf mutation the small molecule braf inhibitor vemurafenib  has shown significant activity with response rates of approximately 50%. unfortunately, these responses tend to be short-lived, and most patients relapse within 8– <dig> months  <cit> . more recently, monoclonal antibodies that block signaling of ctla <dig>  and pd <dig>  have induced durable clinical remissions in human patients with widely disseminated metastatic melanoma; when the two antibodies were combined, response rates were over 40% and in many instances, were durable  <cit> .

there are currently no monoclonal antibodies that block ctla <dig> or pd <dig> available for use in veterinary medicine, and while the chemotherapy agent carboplatin has demonstrated some activity against primary oral malignant melanoma in dogs, there is no definitive evidence that any chemotherapy agents work in the microscopic disease setting. recently, the oncept xenogeneic melanoma vaccine was approved for use in dogs with oral malignant melanoma in the adjuvant setting following control of the primary tumor/local disease  <cit> . however, many dogs still develop widespread metastatic disease necessitating the development of new therapeutic approaches.

selective inhibitor of nuclear export  compounds that target the nuclear export protein xpo <dig> represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention in canine and human melanoma. several studies have demonstrated that treatment of tumor cell lines with sine compounds results in enhanced expression of p <dig> and p <dig>  and redistribution of these proteins into the nucleus  <cit> . with respect to melanoma, both p <dig> and retinoblastoma protein  undergo increased nuclear export preventing them from engaging in active tumor suppression  <cit> . in canine melanoma p <dig> was shown to be excluded from the nucleus in  <dig> cell lines and  <dig> of  <dig> tumor samples  <cit> . the importance of p <dig> activity independent of mutation status has been demonstrated in human melanoma and therapies that increase the activity of this protein have shown promise  <cit> . following treatment of human melanoma lines with a variety of sine compounds  in combination with a small molecule braf inhibitor, stabilization of p <dig> was shown to be at least partly responsible for induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . furthermore, the combination of xpo <dig> and braf inhibition was found to be synergistic, also altering the expression of rb and survivin  <cit> .

given the similarity of canine and human melanoma with respect to tumor suppressor dysregulation, we were interested in determining whether sine compounds would exhibit biologic activity against canine melanoma cells. several sine compounds have been tested in vitro and found to have good activity at nanomolar concentrations against human prostate, renal, pancreatic, and breast cancer cell lines, as well as against a variety of cell lines representing hematopoietic malignancies   <cit> . currently, the sine compound kpt- <dig>  is undergoing evaluation in human clinical trials, while the sine compound kpt- <dig>  has completed both phase  <dig> and  <dig> canine clinical trials. significant activity against canine nhl was observed in vitro in the low nanomolar range against canine diffuse large b cell lymphoma  samples, as well as in a canine dlbcl cell line  <cit> . in the phase  <dig> setting, partial response to kpt- <dig> was observed in dogs with nhl, and unlike previously tested xpo <dig> inhibitors such as leptomycin b  <cit> , kpt- <dig> exhibited good tolerability with anorexia and weight loss as the main clinical effects noted  <cit> . based on these findings, we elected to evaluate the potential utility of this sine compound in canine melanoma lines prior to clinical testing in dogs with melanoma.

in the current study we found that kpt- <dig> inhibited the proliferation of canine melanoma cell lines with ic <dig> concentrations ranging from 71– <dig> nm. these doses are biologically relevant and achievable based on pharmacokinetic data derived from studies in both healthy dogs and dogs enrolled in the phase  <dig> and  <dig> studies  <cit> . furthermore, we demonstrated that kpt- <dig> induced apoptosis of the melanoma cell lines, although these effects were somewhat delayed, occurring at 72– <dig> hours after drug exposure. this delay in effect is concordant with prior data generated in human melanoma lines in which bcl- <dig> was not down regulated until 32 hours following exposure to sine compounds  <cit> . additionally, in human leukemia cell lines treated with sine compounds, cycle arrest was noted at 24 hours but ic₅₀ values were best at  <dig> and 72 hours  <cit> .

although significant changes in proliferation or apoptosis were not found until 72– <dig> hours after drug exposure, the melanoma cell lines demonstrated changes in gene and protein expression at much earlier time points. this is likely a consequence of the manner in which tumor cells are disrupted. inhibition of xpo <dig> results in a redistribution of nuclear proteins and consequently, an impact on gene transcription, largely due to restoration of tumor suppressor protein localization. this initiates a genome survey to determine whether sufficient critical non-repairable errors exist that necessitate induction of apoptosis. during this time, the cells may be able to compensate for changes in nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of key proteins for a period of time through such mechanisms as autophagy, until a critical point is reached and the process of apoptosis is initiated  <cit> . the mechanism of action of xpo <dig> inhibitors is thus substantially different from that associated with small molecules that block known “driver” proteins often constitutively active through mutation, translocation or overexpression. in these cases, blocking the function of the driver protein typically results in rapid cell death as the tumor cell has become reliant on that particular protein for survival.

as expected, treatment of melanoma lines with kpt- <dig> increased the protein expression of p <dig> and p <dig> and the mrna of p <dig> and mic- <dig>  there also was enhanced nuclear translocation of p <dig> and p <dig>  interestingly, the mel  <dig> line, previously reported to be p <dig> null  <cit> , was found to have basal p <dig> protein expression that increased after drug exposure. the reason for this discrepancy is not known, although it is possible there have been alterations in gene expression profiles over time. the effects of xpo <dig> inhibition on expression of these tumor suppressor proteins have been well-documented in a variety of human tumor cell lines treated with sine compounds and this is likely a significant contributor to loss of cell viability  <cit> . prior studies with leptomycin b showed that prostate and neuroblastoma human tumor cell lines exhibited upregulation and activation of p <dig> that directly contributed to growth arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . in contrast, apoptosis after inhibition of xpo <dig> can occur regardless of p <dig> status in some tumor lines indicating that this is not the sole mechanism for cell death  <cit> . human melanoma cell lines were shown to undergo apoptosis after sine compound exposure regardless of p <dig> status and other mechanisms such as enhanced puma expression and decreased activation of nf-ĸb were found to be responsible  <cit> . these data are concordant with our studies as all melanoma lines treated underwent apoptosis independent of p <dig> status.

in addition to effects on transcription factors, our data demonstrate a direct effect of kpt- <dig> on its target protein, xpo <dig>  downregulation of xpo <dig> protein was observed in melanoma cell lines as early as 4 hours after drug exposure and expression was nearly completely eliminated by 24 hours of treatment. these findings are concordant with those generated in human myeloma cells treated with the kpt- <dig> and kpt- <dig>  <cit> . similarly, human myeloma cells treated with the reversible xpo <dig> inhibitor cbs <dig> exhibited downregulation of protein that was dependent on the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway  <cit> . while protein was decreased, messenger rna for xpo <dig> was increased in the canine melanoma lines following kpt- <dig> exposure, a finding also observed in human cell lines treated with the sine compounds  <cit> . this likely represents a compensatory mechanism associated with loss of functional xpo <dig> protein. in fact, upregulation of xpo <dig> message is now being used as a biomarker of target inhibition in ongoing human clinical trials of the sine compound kpt- <dig>   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, kpt- <dig> , a novel orally bioavailable xpo <dig> inhibitor exhibits good in vitro single agent activity against canine malignant melanoma cell lines as evidenced by inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. kpt- <dig> downregulated xpo <dig> protein while upregulating xpo <dig> message, indicative of direct effects on the intended target. the biologic effects of kpt- <dig> were demonstrated when cells were treated with nanomolar concentrations of drug which have been shown to be biologically achievable in dogs following oral administration. these data lay the groundwork for future clinical evaluation of kpt- <dig> in dogs with malignant melanoma.
