BACKGROUND
decades of research have shown that a number of natural and man-made chemicals interfere with the endocrine system and can result in adverse health effects in humans, mammals and fish  <cit> . wildlife living in, or closely associated with the aquatic environment have been shown to be especially impacted by these so-called endocrine-disrupting chemicals , because our freshwaters, estuaries and oceans act as sinks for chemical discharges  <cit> . oestrogenic edcs in the environment are of particular concern. endogenous oestrogens are a group of closely related steroid hormones essential in the development and functioning of the reproductive system. extensive work has been conducted on natural  and synthetic oestrogens  and their interactions in the vertebrate body, including their tissue distributions, mechanisms of action and pathways of elimination  <cit> . furthermore, adverse effects of exposure to environmental oestrogens have received considerable research attention in a number of animal species, but this work is largely restricted to adults and juveniles  <cit> , and there has been little study of effects on embryos. nothing is known regarding the relative sensitivities of the different cell types and tissues to oestrogenic edcs, or other contaminants, during embryogenesis. furthermore, in spite of the widespread concern for edcs in the aquatic environment, there are very few bioassay systems that are sufficiently sensitive for accurate prediction of adverse biological effects. moreover, conventional methods of edcs detection such as tissue culture  <cit>  and in vitro techniques  <cit>  are limited in their capacity to elucidate oestrogen signalling pathways and tissue specific physiological impacts.

teleost fish have three oestrogen receptors , eralpha, erbeta- <dig> and erbeta- <dig>  that show tissue specific patterns of expression and function in adults  <cit> . the different er subtypes are also widely expressed in body tissues in early life stages, from embryos to young larvae  <cit> , suggesting crucial roles of these signalling pathways in early development. indeed, recently it was found that knockdown of er-beta <dig> in the zebrafish suppressed normal development of the lateral line neuromast cells  <cit> . endogenous oestrogen receptors activated by oestrogenic chemicals bind to oestrogen response elements within regulatory regions of oestrogen-responsive genes. response elements are recognized by nuclear transcription factors, including members of the steroid/nuclear receptor super family that then, together with various other regulatory factors mediate transcription of the associated downstream genes  <cit> .

the adopted model in this work, the zebrafish  has become one of the most commonly used animals for examining effects of aquatic pollutants  <cit> . furthermore, with the available genomic resources and suitability of this species for molecular manipulations, the zebrafish has been applied more widely for research in developmental biology and understanding of disease processes. the medaka  is another model species widely used in ecotoxicology research and for the development of transgenic techniques. many studies have shown that early life stages of fish have the greatest sensitivity to environmental contaminants and effects on development in the zebrafish and medaka are greatly facilitated by the fact that their embryos are transparent.  <cit> .

use of tissue-specific promoters has become a powerful tool for studies on endogenous gene expression  <cit>  and to analyse the function of promoters  <cit>  and transgenic fish have become an established technique in developmental analyses. this generally includes using a specific promoter and a green fluorescent protein  or a luciferase reporter gene. to improve the efficiency of the sensitivity, tissue specificity and ease of generating transgenic fish, various manipulated gene systems have recently been introduced. one of these is the gal4-uas system. this is now used widely for the over expression of transgenes in various transgenic animals, including zebrafish  <cit> . this system comprises a two-part expression system that utilises the yeast transcription activator protein gal <dig> and its target sequence uas , to which gal <dig> binds to activate gene transcription  <cit> . the tol <dig> transposon system, originally identified in the medaka  <cit> , has recently been used to enhance the success rate of dna integration into the zebrafish genome  <cit> . this is illustrated in the work of  <cit> ) where used of tol <dig> increased the transgenesis rate of linear dna from 5% to 50%.

transgenic zebrafish have considerable potential for use in aquatic ecotoxicology to screen and test for hormone mimics and potentially to develop a more advanced system for assessing health impacts of chemicals. as a consequence there has been considerable activity in a number of laboratories to develop transgenic zebrafish as tools for screening and testing of chemicals  <cit> . transgenic fish have the advantage that tissue specific effects of edcs can be identified to allow for more directed and detailed studies to inform on health outcomes. however, it is time consuming, both to produce and maintain the stable transgenic lines. as a consequence, a number of studies have investigated the use of transient expression assays to examine the spatial and temporal expression of reporter genes that are fused to the regulatory regions of various genes in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . to date, biosensor transgenic fish  have only been generated in the zebrafish and medaka, and such technology has not been applied widely to other fish species. in theory, however, having developed the technology for these model species, it would be possible to develop a functional ‘transient assay’, by which vector dna is transiently introduced into the fish embryo, in almost any fish species where the eggs produced can physically be injected, and thus examine the effect of chemical exposure specifically in those fish species.

to date, there have not been any reported transient expression assays for the detection of oestrogenic edcs. the transient expression assay process normally involves the injection of fertilised embryos with a construct and followed by assaying of the response  once the embryos/larvae have reached the desired stage of development. a major advantage of the transient assay would be that the technique is applicable to a variety of fish species for examining tissue, stage and chemicals specific responses without the need to generate tg fish lines.

with a plan to develop a rapid and sensitive transient expression assay system to evaluate the oestrogenic activity of environmental chemicals in different fish embryos, we utilised a gal4ff-uas system that incorporates a two-step signal amplification process and a synthetic oestrogen responsive element with 3eres. a major aim in this initial work was to make a construct that was highly responsive to oestrogenic edcs. we then examined the responsiveness of the oestrogen response elements and tissue and stage specific responses in zebrafish using a transient expression assay. finally, we tested our plasmid in another fish species, the medaka, to show that transient expression assay is suitable for observation of effects of oestrogenic compounds in other fish test species.

RESULTS
construction of reporter gene vectors with oestrogen responsive promoters
in the sequence of results reported, we first developed a novel transient assay system using a synthetic oestrogen responsive element, tol <dig> and gal4-uas systems and the gfp reporter gene, responsive to environmental oestrogen. we then investigated the functional capability of this construct and response to a range of potent and weak environmental oestrogens using a transient expression assay using green fluorescent microscopy in zebrafish embryos/larvae. finally, we proofed our vector system further in another fish species, the medaka.

the construct produced for detecting oestrogen is shown in figure  <dig>  specific primers of erec <dig> were run in pcr reactions to produce the eres. the eres were  <dig> base pair  sequences that consisted of a 17-bp inverted repeat 5’-caggtca nnn tgacctg-3’ followed by an at-rich sequence  <cit> . other studies that have made tg fish for screening of oestrogen chemicals have used various  promoters, including for the following genes, vitellogenin   <cit> , choriogenin l   <cit>  and aromatase b  <cit> . legler et al.   <cit>  developed a transgenic zebrafish line that expressed the reporter gene luciferase  for examining oestrogenic compounds. although the construct they used, peretata-luc, was sensitive, luciferase is not as stable as gfp. the luciferase half-life varies from  <dig> to 14 h  <cit> , as it strongly depends on the host cell and the gene construct. furthermore, measurement of luciferase is a bioassay that requires tissue homogenisation. in contrast, gfp can be detected in living cells/organisms. the use of gfp in intact fish also has advantages over use of in vitro transfected cell cultures, because it allows for integration of toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic factors into the response  <cit> . the constructs that have been used in previous studies for developing oestrogen response systems, such as pegfp-chgl  <cit> , pzvtg1-egfp  <cit>  are also liver specific genes.

in a mammalian cell culture system, sathya et al.   <cit>  showed that a construct with 3eres produced an enhanced expression compared with 2eres and 4eres, especially in response to the natural oestrogen, oestrdaiol-17β . we therefore similarly adopted three copies of ere in our construct. for the transcriptional initiation, the tata box sequence was inserted at 158 bp upstream of the gal4ff start codon and the tol <dig> transposon system was adopted to provide a more efficient transient reporter analyses. after the sequential synthesis of five successive constructs, we generated a novel plasmid vector system, p3ere-tata-gal4ff containing, tol <dig> and a poly a tail and employing two steps for amplification of the signal  where gal4ff activates “uas-gfp’. in the activation process, the first step, binding of oestrogens to er and subsequent binding to ere, induces the synthesis of gal4ff protein and in the second step gal4ff protein induces synthesis of gfp. this two-step process allows amplification of the resulting signal which, in theory, should give rise to a more “sensitive” transient expression assay system for detecting oestrogen chemicals than has been developed previously. in our approach, we used gal4ff rather than the more commonly used gal-vp16/uas system, because gal4ff is reported to be less toxic than gal4-vp <dig> in zebrafish cells  <cit> .

induction of gfp in the zebrafish embryo transient expression assay
in the transient microinjection studies, expression of gene in zebrafish and medaka embryos was mosaic because the microinjected recombinant dnas were not integrated to all cells. we minimised this problem by flanking the transgene with a tol <dig> transposon and we were then able to identify target tissues for oestrogens in early life stages more effectively  <cit> .

no differences in mortality rate were observed between both control and oestrogen chemical treated groups , with the exception for 100 μg np/l where the most embryos died by  <dig> hpf. the lack of toxicity effects in zebrafish embryos at the exposure concentrations adopted  compared very favourably with previously reported findings  for ee <dig> <cit>  and kishida et al.  for e <dig> <cit> ).

gfp expression was seen at 24 h after exposure to ee <dig> , albeit at low level, whereas there was no gfp expression detected in the controls at this time. there was stronger and more specific tissue gfp expression in ee <dig> treated embryos at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, focused mainly in the liver, muscle and heart and this was therefore adopted as the time period for assessing tissue specific effects of oestrogens in the transient assay.

at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf there was no gfp expression detected in embryos in the unexposed controls , but gfp expressing cells were seen clearly after exposure to ee <dig> . no specific gfp expression was observed in the liver at the lowest exposure concentration of ee <dig> , but weak gfp expression signals were detected in the heart and somite muscle for this exposure concentration . gfp expression was most clearly seen in the higher ee <dig> exposures. for exposure to 100 ng ee2/l gfp was detected in a feint and dispersed manner in the liver and there was strong gfp expression in the heart and somite muscle. gfp expression in the heart was confirmed by the periodical contractile movement of the gfp expressing cells with each heart beat in the live injected larvae. strong gfp expression was also observed in the anterior somite muscles. for exposure to 1000 ng ee2/l, gfp expression was induced strongly in the liver, somite muscle and heart . moreover, many gfp expressing cells were observed in the anterior lateral part of the injected embryos . the number of cells expressing gfp appeared to be positively associated with the concentration of the ee <dig> exposure . for the transgenic lines of zebrafish that have now been developed, it has bee shown that oestrogenic edcs activate ere in liver  <cit> , forebrain  <cit> , neuromast  <cit> , heart  <cit>  and somite muscle  <cit>  and this is consistent with the expression patterns seen here our transient assay.

exposure to the natural steroid oestrogen, e <dig>  resulted in similar responses to that seen for ee <dig>  no gfp expression was observed in unexposed controls . similarly, no gfp expression was observed for the lowest e <dig> exposure concentration . no gfp expression was observed in the liver at 100 ng e2/l, but it was seen in the muscle  and heart . exposure to 1000 ng e2/l strongly induced gfp expression in the heart, otic vesicle and somite muscle and there were some gfp expressing cells observed in the liver . with e <dig>  as well as with ee <dig>  the gfp signal was also observed in the lateral line neuromast cells albeit a lower frequency . exposure to 10 μg np/l induced low level gfp expression in the heart and somite muscle . the reason for weak gfp induction by np might be due to a lower sensitivity of early development stages to this chemical in the zebrafish, as has been suggested previously  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that np might be transformed in fish to less potent metabolites  <cit> . these data indicate that different xeno-oestrogens have different target tissue responsiveness and therefore potentially different health effects.

to assess the consistency of transient expression of gfp, we counted the number of gfp-positive embryos for different tissues at  <dig> hpf. as shown in table  <dig>  for controls no gfp expression was observed in the liver, heart and forebrain, but weak gfp expression signals were detected in some embryos in somite muscles  and the otic vesicle . in contrast, in injected embryos , strong gfp expression occurred in the muscle and heart on exposure to both ee <dig> and e <dig>  this was also the case for the liver in injected embryos exposed to both ee <dig> and e2: 74% for 1000 ng ee2/l, 62% for 100 ng ee2/l and 71% for 1000 ng e2/l. for the forebrain, the proportion of embryos expressing gfp were 33% and 26% for exposure to 1000 ng ee2/l and 1000 ng e2/l, respectively. for the np exposure, the proportion of injected embryos showing gfp expression in muscle was 71% and 56% for the heart.

in general, the expression of gfp appeared to show a concentration-dependent response for exposure to the test oestrogens, as quantified via western blotting. the highest ee <dig> exposure group  indicated a  <dig> -fold increase in gfp levels in whole embryos compared with untreated controls. exposure to 10 ng ee2/l resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase in gfp compared with the control . exposure to e <dig> at 1000 ng/l induced a  <dig> -fold increase in gfp above controls and a  <dig> -fold increase above controls for exposure to <dig> μg np/l . for the highest exposures to ee <dig> and e <dig> , the level of gfp induction for ee <dig> was stronger than for e <dig>  indicating that ee <dig> was more potent than e <dig> 

assessments of the relative potencies of various environmental oestrogens in our transient assay were consistent with those reported in the literature for other assays systems, with ee <dig> being the most potent compound compared with e <dig>  np and bpa. legler et al.   <cit>  similarly reported that ee <dig> was the most potent  oestrogen compared with e <dig>  np and diphthalate  in their transgenic zebrafish assay. relative potency estimates for these chemicals however, can vary depending on the assessment method. for example ee <dig> was shown to be  <dig> -fold more potent than e <dig> in yeast-based in vitro assay  <cit>  but had around a  <dig> times higher potency than e <dig> and e <dig> for vtg induction  in female zebrafish  <cit>  in in vivo. thorpe et al.   <cit>  using a vtg induction assay in vivo, reported that ee <dig> was between  <dig> to  <dig> times more potent than e <dig>  the responses to oestrogen in our zebrafish transient assay developed have shown it to be as sensitive as some other widely used oestrogen detection systems in fish , and as sensitive as available oestrogen responsive tg fish  <cit> .

induction of gfp in the medaka embryo transient expression assay
to examine if our transient assay system was applicable in other fish species, we assessed the response of gfp in the medaka embryo . medaka has four types of pigment cells, namely melanophores, xanthophores, leucophores and iridophores  <cit>  that could interfere with the detection of gfp. to avoid this, we imaged the embryos using normal light, green  and red . this was done because pigment cells are auto-fluorescent both in green and red spectra, and therefore by overlaying the different images  we were able to distinguish the signal due to gfp. at  <dig> dpf, injected medaka embryos showed gfp expression in the skin, whereas no gfp expression was detected in the control . to enhance our ability to see clear gfp responses in other tissues, we exposed the injected embryos for 11 days. at this time, tissue specific expression became obvious in the liver, heart, gall bladder and somite . medaka showed a lower level of expression of gfp in muscle compared with zebrafish  which might be due to differences in the transgenesis efficiency with tol <dig> system between the two species . however, the different responses between the species may also be due to the physiological and genetic differences between them.

gfp expression observed in the skin and gallbladder in medaka was not observed in zebrafish, which might suggest that oestrogen receptor expression varies between fish species or oestrogen receptor binding affinities for different fish species might be different in the different embryos, at least for these organs. differences between fish species have been shown for tissue distribution of er subtypes as well as differences in er affinities for environmental oestrogens . we do not yet know how the oestrogenic response pattern observed by gfp expression is related to the expression of ers. the available literature suggests that ers are expressed ubiquitously in the whole embryos both in zebrafish and medaka with an elevated expression in the neuromast cells in zebrafish  <cit> . given this, the tissue specific response of gfp to oestrogenes may be as a consequence of the co-factors associated with er signalling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the fact that transient expression analysis has been used in various areas of developmental biology, there has been no report using transient expression analysis for detection of oestrogen compounds. the vector system we have developed and applied in a transient assay effectively detects oestrogenic responses in body tissues. furthermore, the transient assay system is as sensitive as many of the available tg fish for detecting oestrogens, in some cases considerably more so  <cit>  there are however, exceptions to this, where the most sensitive tg fish developed have been shown to respond to oestrogens at 1 ng ee2/l   <cit>  and 10 ng ee2/l )  <cit> . drawbacks of the transient expression assay over tg fish includes the fact that mosaicism can make it more difficult to detect gfp expression in physically small tissues such as lateral line neuromast.

comparing our transient assay system with vtg induction, a well established biomarker of oestrogen exposure, the detection threshold for ee <dig>  in zebrafish in vivo is 2 ng ee2/l  <cit> . induction of vtg in medaka and common carp hepatocytes in culture is reported at 30 ng e2/l  <cit>  and  <dig>  μm e <dig> <cit> , respectively. the ec <dig> concentration  for ee <dig> in the mcf- <dig> cell assay and yeast-oestrogen screen  from folmar et al.   <cit>  is  <dig>  nm  and  <dig>  nm , respectively.

the vector system developed detected oestrogenic edcs in both the zebrafish and medaka, indicating the likely wide suitability for application to other fish species. this system would be a particularly powerful technique for use in fish species with long generation times and/or where there are other difficulties for generating transgenic lines in those species. the transient expression assay further provides a novel in vivo system for investigating oestrogenic effects on embryo development in fish.
