BACKGROUND
it is now generally accepted that the properties of a particular dna sequence in cells are not solely defined by the nucleotide sequence itself, but by "epigenetic" modifications as well. epigenetic modifications imply the methylation of cytosine residues in cpg dinucleotides and covalent modifications of core histones. these modifications allow for flexible, but heritable at the same time, reprogramming of the genome.

in histone h <dig> five lysine residues can be methylated   <cit> . methylation at k <dig> and k <dig> play opposite roles in structuring repressive or accessible chromatin domains, with k <dig> methylation associated with transcriptionally active chromatin and k <dig> methylation with inactive chromatin in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . in addition, these lysine residues can be mono-, di- or tri-methylated, which contributes to the distinct qualities of h3/k <dig> and h3/k <dig> methylation. similar to h3/k <dig> methylation, dna methylation is associated with silenced chromatin and there appeared to be an interplay between the two epigenetic modifications. it is still an open question whether dna methylation directs h3/k <dig> methylation or other way around, for both scenarios the experimental evidences do exist  <cit> . it recently has been shown that in mammalian cells the maintenance dna methyltransferase dnmt <dig> is associated with proteins involved in chromatin reprogramming, including histones deacetylases, and is required for the establishment of h3/k <dig> methylation  <cit> . various experimental data suggest that the dna methylation causes multiple changes in local nucleosomes, such as deacetylation of histones h <dig> and h <dig>  prevents h3/k <dig> methylation and induces h3/k <dig> methylation  <cit> .

the fertilization of mouse egg causes dramatic changes in organization of both paternal and maternal genomes. initially arrested in metaphase ii oocyte completes the meiosis, forming haploid maternal pronucleus and extruding the second polar body. the densely packed with protamines sperm dna decondences, protamines get exchanged by histones and dna undergoes active demethylation. the demethylation in the early mouse zygote occurs asymmetrically on paternal dna and affects different classes of repetitive and single copy sequences, but not the control regions of imprinted genes  <cit> . previous studies have shown the exclusive localization of methylated h3/k <dig> in maternal pronucleus of the mouse zygote, which additionally marks the epigenetic asymmetry between maternal and paternal pronuclei  <cit> .

here we examine time dependent changes of chromatin structure in the mouse zygote, focusing on the dynamics of the acquisition of histones in the paternal pronucleus and methylation status of histone h <dig> at positions k <dig> and k <dig> 

RESULTS
in order to obtain mouse zygotes at different stages of development and to provide the precise timing for fertilization we used in vitro fertilization of mature mouse oocytes. histones and methylated h3/k <dig> and h3/k <dig> were detected by using indirect immunofluorescence. in our experiments we used antibodies, which specifically recognize mono- or tri-methylated forms of h3/k <dig>  and di-methylated h3/k <dig>  the zygotes were analyzed after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours incubation of mature oocytes with capacitated sperm from donor males. after  <dig> hours most of embryos were found to be at metaphase and some already at telophase stage of the first mitotic division. even using in vitro fertilization, the obtained zygotes are not completely synchronous in their development and it is more appropriate to use pn stages classification, which is based on the morphological changes of both pronuclei  <cit> .

appearance of histones on paternal chromosomes
we performed the immunostaining against core histones  in all the stages tested in combination with antibodies, recognizing the specific methylated forms of histone h <dig>  this served as a positive control for the immunostaining procedure and allowed us to follow the dynamics of histone acquisition in the paternal pronucleus. histones were first detected shortly after the penetration of sperm into the oocyte and the beginning of the decondensation of sperm chromatin. according to pn stages classification we could clearly detect histones on paternal pronucleus at late pn0/early pn <dig> stages , exactly when the global demethylation starts  <cit>  .

dynamic changes in h3/k <dig> methylation in paternal genome
probing the mouse zygotes at different stages with antibodies specifically recognizing either mono- or tri-methylated h3/k <dig> revealed that these types of modifications are associated with maternal genome through all zygotic stages, including mature oocyte and seem to be rather ubiquitous . as for the paternal pronucleus – we detect the appearance of h3/k4mono-methylation in the beginning of pn <dig>  stage , only slightly delayed compared to the appearance of core histones . by pn <dig> – pn <dig> stages both paternal and maternal pronuclei show equal staining intensity. this indicates that h3/k <dig> specific histone methyltransferase, possibly set <dig>  <cit> , is quite active in the early zygote and methylates histone h <dig> after it is incorporated into the nucleosomes. in contrast to that, it has been shown recently that h3/k <dig> specific histone methyltransferase is inactivated immediately after the fertilization by yet unknown active mechanism, which involves de novo synthesis of some specific factors  <cit> . h3/k4tri-methylation becomes detectable later, starting from pn <dig> stage  and the difference in antibodies staining intensity between paternal and maternal pronuclei becomes indistinguishable in the last pronuclear stage pn <dig>   and in metaphase stage of first mitosis approximately  <dig> hours p.f. . the fact that h3/k <dig> first becomes mono-methylated and several hours later tri-methylated suggests progressive methylation of histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>  we also suggest that histone h <dig> gets incorporated into the nucleosomes being unmethylated and then undergoes methylation because we observe first the appearance of histones and then h3/k4mono-methylation. in contrast to that – acetylation of histones h <dig> and h <dig> happens before they are incorporated into the nucleosomes, and after the nucleosome assembly they can get deacetylated by histone deacetylases  whenever required  <cit> . but no histone demethylase has been found so far.

h3/k <dig> methylation but not h3/k <dig> defines the genomes asymmetry in the mouse zygote
in order to compare the patterns of h3/k <dig> and h3/k <dig> methylation we performed the immunostaining of mouse zygotes using antibodies, which recognize di-methylated h3/k <dig>  our results are in the agreement with earlier observations that h3/k <dig> methylation is only attributed to the maternal genome and is completely absent from the paternal  <cit>  . in normal somatic cells the absence or disruption of h3/k <dig> methylation leads to the chromosome instability and affects chromosomes segregation during mitosis  <cit> . therefore the absence of h3/k <dig> methylation on paternal chromosomes is rather surprising and compromises its role in chromosomes segregation. the epigenetic asymmetry between paternal and maternal genomes is observed till 2-cell stage and is characterized by low levels of dna methylation and h3/k <dig> methylation in paternal genome  <cit> . in case with h3/k <dig> methylation – the asymmetry is observed only in the beginning of the zygotic development and is indistinguishable in the metaphase stage of the first mitotic division . recent data from liu et al. suggest that h3/k <dig> methylation does not depend on dna methylation  <cit> , but it is only paternal dna which gets demethylated in the mouse zygote and at the same time it does not have detectable h3/k <dig> methylation. according to data published by santos et al.  <cit>  dna demethylation starts at pn <dig> stage, i.e. at a time when we first observe the appearance of h3/k4mono-methylation , and is completed at pn <dig> stage when h3/k4mono-methylation in paternal pronucleus reaches approximately the same level as in the maternal . this fact is raising the question if such a coincidence might indicate that dna demethylation and the establishment of h3/k <dig> methylation are interdependent. demethylation of paternal dna upon the fertilization is not a universal phenomenon for mammalian species. in bovine zygote paternal dna becomes only partially demethylated, while in sheep and rabbit zygotes the demethylation is hardly detectable  <cit> . the analysis of chromatin modification in early zygotes of these species might help to get an answer if dna demethylation depends on, or is directed by the specific chromatin modifications.

CONCLUSIONS
unlike h3/k <dig> methylation, methylation of h3/k <dig> is not attributed only to the maternal genome but appears shortly after the acquisition of histones by paternal pronucleus. the methylation of h3/k <dig> is progressive and by first mitotic division reaches approximately same level as in maternal genome.
