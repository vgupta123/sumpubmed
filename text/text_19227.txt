BACKGROUND
pattern recognition receptors  are key players in host innate immune response against microbial pathogens. in order to launch effective defense mechanisms in response to viral infections, a number of cellular sensors that recognize universal components common to many viruses have been characterized. double-stranded rna  is one of the components that mammalian cells have developed several different receptors for since most viruses produce dsrna during replication  <cit> .

interferon-inducible double-stranded rna activated protein kinase  has long been studied as an intracellular sensor for viral dsrna. pkr was initially characterized to participate in the mechanism that shuts down cellular translation to suppress viral replication and is now believed to be involved in a wide range of other cellular responses to viral infection  <cit> . toll-like receptor  <dig>  has been considered to be essential for mediating nf-kb-inducible gene responses to polyic, a synthetic analogue of viral dsrna  <cit> , but there has yet been any strong evidence of physical interaction between tlr <dig> and viral dsrna. the precise cellular location of tlr <dig> is still under discussion, but generally it is thought to be cell type dependent. tlr <dig> is expressed on the cell surface of fibroblast, but in two subtypes of dendritic cells it is thought to be located in endosomal compartments and transported to cell surface upon polyic stimulation  <cit> . however, the role of tlr <dig> in innate immunity was soon questioned when tlr <dig> knock-out mice had no significant defect against virus challenges  <cit> . more recently, retinoic acid inducible gene i  and melanoma differentiation-associated gene  <dig> , both rna helicases, were reported to be novel and important intracellular regulators of polyic-mediated signaling pathway leading to the activation of nf-kb  <cit> . embryonic fibroblasts from rig-i knock-out mice showed substantial defects in activation of nf-kb inducible genes participating in immune defense  <cit> . subsequent studies have indicated cell type specific involvements of these dsrna receptors  <cit> .

until the novel function of these rna helicases, rig-i and mda <dig>  was discovered, a dogma of dsrna mediated signaling has been a separated or integrated signaling pathway between tlr3-dependent extracellular recognition of viral dsrna and pkr-mediated intracellular recognition of viral dsrna. particularly in the tlr3-pkr integrated model  <cit> , the recognition of viral dsrna by tlr <dig> activates signaling cascades that include pkr, leading to the activation of nf-kb and interferon regulatory factor  <dig> . as a result, interferon genes are induced by synergy between nf-kb and irf <dig>  and other nf-kb-inducible inflammatory genes are also activated. pkr is believed to initiate a similar signaling pathway somewhere downstream because pkr could function as an internal receptor for dsrna as well as a second messenger in tlr <dig> pathway. therefore, whether these two pathways are indeed integrated or separated, tlr3-mediated signaling pathway has been considered to be a key route of anti-viral responses. however, according to the recent studies, rig-i/mda5-mediated signaling pathways seem to be not only tlr3-independent but also quite distinct from tlr <dig> pathway in terms of participating downstream molecules  <cit> . although these findings imply that there are more than one dsrna signaling pathway, the mechanism of action for additional intracellular  pathways is not yet clear.

a number of signaling pathways in innate immunity eventually lead to the activation of nf-kb because its activation is critical for the induction of many key genes in host defense systems. so far, five members of nf-kb family have been identified: nf-kb <dig> , nf-kb <dig> , c-rel, rela  and relb . a functionally active nf-kb transcription factor consists of homodimers or heterodimers of nf-kb members. the p50/p <dig> heterodimer represents the proto-typical nf-kb factor although a number of different combinations of functional dimers are possible. the primary mechanism by which nf-kb activity is regulated involves pre-existing nf-kb dimers that are sequestered in cytoplasm and held inactive by inhibitor proteins such as inhibitor of kb - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . when appropriate signaling cascades are activated, phosphorylation of inhibitor molecules by upstream kinases leads to the dissociation and degradation of the inhibitors through a ubiquitination pathway, and the released and activated nf-kb dimers can then translocate into nucleus to function as transcriptional regulators  <cit> . although nf-kb has been extensively studied, the differential role and utilization of each member is not fully understood due to its complex nature and the inherent variations in cell types and in signaling cascades used in different studies.

in this study, we show that there are two distinct dsrna signaling pathways exist and that these pathways utilize different signaling molecules, particularly nf-kb rela and relb. we also propose that the utilization of relb may be the key mechanism of powerful induction of ifnb and other inflammatory genes in response to intracellular dsrna.

RESULTS
differential cellular responses to extracellular and intracellular polyic treatments
the human fibrosarcoma cell line, ht <dig>  has been extensively used as a model for studying ifn signaling  <cit> . it is known to respond to dsrna  <cit>  and express functional tlr <dig>  <cit> . given recent interest in intracellular dsrna-sensing mechanisms, we studied the responses of ht <dig> cells to extracellular stimulation by polyic, via addition to the culture medium, as compared to intracellular stimulation, by transfection of the polyic. steady-state mrna levels of ifnb, representing the prototypical response gene for dsrna sensing, were measured using quantitative real-time pcr . a robust induction of ifnb was observed at  <dig> μg/ml of extracellular polyic , but interestingly ht <dig> cells exhibited significantly greater sensitivity to intracellular stimulation by polyic transfection as the dose response curve was shifted by more than two orders of magnitude . specifically,  <dig>  μg/ml of intracellular polyic  treatment induced even greater ifnb steady-state mrna expression levels than  <dig> μg/ml of ex-polyic treatment. from this basic observation, we were interested to determine whether these two forms of dsrna sensing were simply quantitatively different or qualitatively distinct in their mechanisms of regulation and biological functions.

we studied the kinetics of responses in ht <dig> cells to extracellular vs. intracellular dsrna for several known nf-kb-dependent genes  along with ifnb. ht <dig> cells were treated with  <dig> μg/ml ex-polyic or  <dig>  μg/ml in-polyic for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours, and the mrna levels of these genes were measured using qpcr. we observed three distinct expression patterns among these genes in response to ex-polyic and in-polyic. ifnb exemplified one pattern in which ex-polyic resulted in a short phase of elevated mrna accumulation, peaking at  <dig> hours  followed by a well-documented down-regulation phase  <cit> , whereas in-polyic led to both a substantively increased magnitude of induction and an extended period of elevated mrna steady-state levels, for at least up to  <dig> hours . this pattern was similarly observed for tnf and il- <dig> . alternately, a second group of genes, exemplified by il- <dig> and ccl <dig> , exhibited similar kinetics to the first pattern in response to intracellular and extracellular polyic stimulations with a moderate  and sustained induction over  <dig> hours. ccl <dig> expression represented a third pattern with similar kinetics of mrna level inductions between ex-polyic and in-polyic stimulation, that was slow and progressive, but in which in-polyic provided a higher magnitude of accumulation than ex-polyic .

the substantive magnitude and extended period of gene inductions by polyic has been shown to involve positive feedback loops. while it is known that autocrine ifn production provides a positive feedback loop for ex-polyic and some viruses, it is yet unclear whether autocrine ifns may play a similar role for in-polyic. unless negative feedback mechanisms are activated, the cellular signals initiated by these genes can be amplified. therefore, we studied the effect of cycloheximide, which blocks new protein synthesis, on mrna level inductions in response to ex-polyic and in-polyic stimulation. ht <dig> cells were treated with  <dig> μg/ml ex-polyic or  <dig>  μg/ml in-polyic for  <dig> hours in the absence/presence of  <dig> μg/ml cycloheximide. the substantive induction of these genes by in-polyic was diminished when new protein synthesis was blocked whereas gene inductions in response to ex-polyic stimulation were relatively not inhibited . these findings suggest that distinct regulatory mechanisms govern intracellular vs. extracellular dsrna sensing in ht <dig> cells.

differential induction of anti-viral activity by extracellular and intracellular polyic
we were particularly interested in the substantive induction of ifnb in response to a relatively small input of in-polyic. to examine the biological significance of this response, we assessed the antiviral activity induced by in-polyic as compared to ex-polyic treatment . ht <dig> cells were pre-treated with ex-polyic or in-polyic for  <dig> hours and then challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus  for  <dig> hours or vesicular stomatitis virus  for  <dig> hours with a wide range of multiplicity of infections . under these conditions, the observed median tissue culture infectious dose  for emcv and vsv was approximately moi =  <dig> - <dig> . whereas extracellular stimulation with  <dig>  μg/ml polyic was essentially ineffective, transfection with the same amount of polyic provided near complete protection against viral challenge extending up to moi =  <dig>  this represented a comparable level of antiviral protection to that provided by treatment with  <dig> u/ml of recombinant ifn-alpha. curiously, while  <dig> μg/ml ex-polyic was ineffective in conferring protection against emcv, some antiviral activity against vsv was observed although still less than that induced by in-polyic  <dig>  μg/ml. these results indicate that the substantive stimulation of ifnb expression by in-polyic is associated with significant antiviral protection although the precise proportions which are ifnb-dependent or -independent is still unclear.

downstream mediators of extracellular and intracellular polyic signaling pathways
tlr <dig> represents the prototypical extracellular dsrna sensor, although its intracellular localization in specific cell types has also been reported  <cit> . while functional tlr <dig> in ht <dig> cells has been reported  <cit> , we verified its function as a dsrna sensor in this cell line using tlr <dig> specific sirna. knock-down efficiency of ~75% was achieved for tlr <dig> using sirna nucleofection . the induction of most genes  in response to ex-polyic  was decreased when tlr <dig> was knocked down whereas the induction of the same genes in response to in-polyic  was not significantly affected, represented by il <dig>  ccl <dig> and ifnb . similar experiments with  <dig> and  <dig> hour treatments showed similar results .

we also took advantage of the human embryonic kidney  <dig>  cell line, which is known to lack functional tlr <dig> expression  <cit> , in order to examine intracellular dsrna signaling. as expected, no response for ifnb was observed when hek <dig> cells were stimulated with up to  <dig> μg/ml ex-polyic but 15-fold induction of ifnb was detected following transfection with  <dig>  μg/ml in-polyic .

involvement of ikk- <dig> in extracellular and intracellular polyic signaling pathways
ikk- <dig> is believed to play a central role in activating nf-kb as a result of tlr <dig> activation  <cit> . since the in-polyic signaling pathway seems to be tlr <dig> independent, the involvement of ikk- <dig> was studied in ht <dig> cells using an inhibitor, ikk- <dig> inhibitor iv . ifnb, il <dig>  il <dig>  tnf, ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> mrna levels were measured in response to ex-polyic  or in-polyic  in the presence of  <dig> μm ikk- <dig> inhibitor iv. induction of ifnb and il <dig> by ex-poly ic was diminished by ikk- <dig> inhibitor iv, but the induction of these genes by in-polyic was not affected . tnf and ccl <dig> inductions by ex-polyic and in-polyic were relatively insensitive to ikk- <dig> inhibitor iv  although il <dig> and ccl <dig> inductions by both types of polyic stimulation were diminished by this inhibitor .

differential roles of rela and relb in gene expression in response to extracellular and intracellular polyic treatments
as our results suggested that in-polyic and ex-polyic signaling pathways differ in several aspects, we next assessed whether these two pathways utilize different nf-kb members for mediating downstream transcription regulation. using sirna targeting rela and relb, knock-down efficiency of ~92% and ~60%, respectively, was achieved in ht <dig> cells . under these conditions, the induction of ifnb, il <dig> and ccl <dig> in response to in-polyic  was diminished by rela knock-down but not affected by relb knock-down . interestingly, while ex-polyic stimulation  was unaffected by rela knock-down, the induction of ifnb, tnf and ccl <dig> was significantly increased by relb knock-down . this experiment was repeated using a second set of rela and relb sirnas and yielded similar results .

relb may have an inhibitory role on gene inductions by ex-polyic stimulation, while the same inhibitory role may not be seen in in-polyic signaling. as a result, the increase in gene induction by ex-polyic in the absence of relb may also work through the same positive feedback mechanism that induced high level of mrna levels in in-polyic signaling. to test this hypothesis, ht <dig> cells with relb knock-down were treated with ex-polyic  in the absence/presence of  <dig> μg/ml cycloheximide. interestingly, the increase in gene inductions by ex-polyic previously seen in relb knock-down was diminished . these results suggest that two types of polyic stimulation induce gene expression through differential usage of nf-kb members rela and relb.

discussion
recent studies have established there are distinct dsrna signaling pathways in innate immunity although the new intracellular pathways, involving two or possibly more members of card and dexd/h box helicase family, are not yet extensively mapped out. we have observed that the gene expression patterns induced by the extracellular and intracellular polyic are different in ht <dig> fibroblast cells, suggesting that at least two distinct dsrna signaling pathways may exist . we also showed that the in-polyic response is tlr3-independent , in concordance with the recent studies.

our study validated the observations of previous studies but also revealed novel aspects of the intracellular dsrna pathway. first, the substantive induction of genes by in-polyic stimulation was diminished when protein synthesis was blocked using cycloheximide . we will discuss this finding further in the context of the inhibitory role of relb in nf-kb signaling pathways. secondly, the substantial induction of ifnb by in-polyic was shown to have biological significance demonstrating effective protection against virus challenges . thirdly, our results showed that ikk- <dig> is critical for the expression of nf-kb inducible genes in both extracellular and intracellular dsrna pathways. however, it was also indicated that some nf-kb inducible genes may be activated through ikk-2-independent mechanism in response to in-polyic .

differential utilization of nf-kb members in a number of different biological systems has been reported. several groups have studied the differential usage of nf-kb rela and relb. earlier studies have observed that the activation of rela is inducible whereas relb is constitutively activated in mouse lymphoid tissues  <cit> . these studies as well as others have shown that relb is not inhibited by ikb- <dig> or ikb- <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, subsequent studies using mouse embryonic fibroblast  have shown that the activation of relb is not through a classical ikk complex containing ikk- <dig> and nemo, but rather through ikk- <dig> and nik in several signaling pathways mediated by lymphotoxinb  <cit> , ebv latent membrane protein  <dig>  <cit> , and rsv  <cit> . these distinct activation mechanisms are closely linked to the difference in activation kinetics between rela and relb. generally, the activation of rela was shown to be fast and transient whereas the activation of relb tended to be gradual but long-lasting  <cit> . although our study suggests there are both ikk-dependent and -independent mechanisms that mediate responses to different forms of polyic stimulation, the specific molecular mechanisms involved remains to be understood. specifically, some possibilities include differential activation of the ikk complex or specific regulation of rela in response to in-polyic stimulation.

several mechanisms of regulation regarding rela and relb have been described. the transcription of relb could be induced by rela activation  <cit> , indicating that the activated rela may contribute to the latent but enhanced activation of relb. this fits into the observation of exchanging dimers, in which the activation of rela is quickly down-regulated by the induction of ikbs but relb switches with rela in gene promoter regions for the prolonged activation of target genes  <cit> . furthermore, even in the absence of functional rela, it is shown that relb may compensate for the loss of rela in development  <cit> . on the other hand, relb may possess a regulatory effect on the expression of inflammatory genes. relb knock-out mice was reported to generally suffer multi-organ inflammation  <cit> , and mef from these mice showed a persistent induction of several chemokines  <cit> . interestingly, relb was shown to form an inactive dimer with rela in tnf-treated mef  <cit> . this phenomenon was initially understood as relb inhibiting activated rela  <cit>  but later explained that rela inhibits relb to block prolonged relb-mediated gene transcription  <cit> .

our results indicated that rela may be the major transcription factor inducing the group of nf-kb regulated genes we tested in both intracellular and extracellular dsrna signaling pathways. our preliminary data showed that ex-polyic induced nuclear translocation of rela at early hours  whereas in-polyic induced nuclear translocation of rela at late hours  . interestingly, in the ex-polyic signaling pathway, our results suggested a negative regulatory role for relb had on the induction of rela-dependent inflammatory genes . specifically, although knock-down of relb alone was insufficient for induction of these inflammatory genes, it provided enhanced expression following ex-polyic stimulation. we had considered the possibility that the apparent lack of relb involvement in in-polyic signaling may have been due to inefficient knock-down , but the unexpected enhancement of ex-polyic induction of downstream genes suggests in fact that the relb knock-down did have some effect on cellular responses to dsrna. conversely, as non-specific or off-target effects of sirna treatments are well-known, these mechanisms may have accounted for the enhancement of extracellular responsiveness to ex-polyic by relb knock-down. however, the concomitant lack of enhanced responsiveness to extracellular signaling in other gene-specific-sirna-treated cells and to intracellular signaling in the same relb-sirna-treated cells argues against such non-specific effects. lastly, the similar results on differential responses to extracellular and intracellular polyic provided by a second distinct relb-sirna further supports the specificity of this observation.

the mechanistic role of relb in the intracellular dsrna signaling is not clear though the translocation of relb to nucleus in response to in-polyic was observed in ht <dig> cells . relb seems to neither drive the powerful induction of ifnb and other inflammatory genes nor to inhibit rela-mediated gene transcription in response to in-polyic . it would appear that in ht <dig> fibroblasts, relb primarily functions as a negative regulator of transcriptional activation in response to extracellular dsrna sensing. given its known participation in forming heterodimers with rela, some form of squelching may be responsible for such a negative regulatory role. however, non-transcriptional mechanisms cannot be ruled out. for example, relb may be required for regulating the expression of a protein that controls mrna stability. as genes like ifnb that contain au-rich elements in their 3' utr are known to be actively targeted for mrna degradation, the loss of such a function could account for the enhanced steady-state ifnb levels we observed in cells with knock-down of relb. whether transcriptional or non-transcriptional, the essential role of inhibitory relb may be to interfere early with the positive feedback loop created by dsrna-inducible genes that are both nf-kb-regulated and nf-kb-activating. figure  <dig> illustrates this proposal. in ex-polyic signaling the inhibitory relb may cut off the loop early contributing to the down-regulation phase, which was observed in many genes , whereas in in-polyic signaling or in relb-knocked-down ex-polyic signaling the positive feedback loop may not be interfered with relb but can be diminished by blocking protein synthesis. we would emphasize that this proposed mechanism may only be relevant to fibroblasts because other types of cells participating in innate immune response  may utilize these pattern recognition receptors in different manners. in other words, relb may not have any inhibitory role in rela-mediated gene responses in these other cell types.

lastly, other molecules involved in dsrna signaling, including irf <dig> and mapk have been observed to exhibit different patterns of activation in response to these two different types of polyic stimulation  <cit> . therefore, consistent with our observations of differential activation of rela and relb, the theme of differential activation of transcription factors by different forms of polyic stimulation seems generalizable. it would be important to study how these additional factors may interact with rela and relb for more complete understanding of gene regulation in response to extracellular and intracellular polyic treatments.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that the two general categories of extracellular vs. intracellular dsrna signaling pathways may utilize different nf-kb members, and particularly the differential utilization of relb may be a key mechanism to drive powerful inductions of nf-kb regulated genes in the intracellular dsrna signaling pathway.
