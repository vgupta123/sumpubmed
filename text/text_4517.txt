BACKGROUND
picrorhiza kurrooa royle ex benth. is a medicinally important endangered plant species of family scrophulariaceae. the species is distributed between  <dig> - <dig>  m above mean sea level in the himalayan region  <cit> . p. kurrooa is widely used in traditional as well as modern system of medicine for the treatment of liver disorders, fever, asthma and jaundice  <cit> . indiscriminate and extensive harvesting and lack of organized cultivation has threatened the status of this plant in nature and is listed as "endangered species" by international union for conservation of nature and natural resources  <cit> . due to narrow distribution range, small population size and high use, the species appears among the  <dig> identified as top priority species for conservation and cultivation in western himalaya.

the biological activity of p. kurrooa is attributed to the presence of iridoid glycosides mainly picroside i and picroside ii. studies have shown that temperature plays an important role in the biosynthesis and accumulation of picrosides  <cit> . a temperature of 15°c favored picrosides accumulation as compared to 25°c and this was in agreement with the expression of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase  and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase , the genes associated with picrosides biosynthesis. however, the progress in unraveling the molecular response of p. kurrooa at these temperatures has been impeded by the dearth of transcriptomic resources. transcriptome sequencing is an efficient way to understand global molecular response by the plant in response to a cue  <cit> . expressed sequence tags  played a significant role in accelerating gene discovery, expression analysis, improving genome annotation, identifying splice variants, and identification of molecular markers  <cit> . transcriptome sequencing through next generation sequencing technology provides extensive data in much shorter time period with enormous depth and coverage to facilitate understanding of major change in the metabolic processes as well as contribute to comparative transcriptomics, evolutionary genomics and gene discovery  <cit> . illumina genome analyzer based sequencing technology  yields huge amount of short reads with high coverage. assembling such short reads is a challenging task, more so in the absence of reference sequences. a few bioinformatics tools have been developed for de novo assembly using short-read sequence data  <cit> , which vary in their success and application, and depends upon data specific strategies.

the present study describes the first global analysis of p. kurrooa transcriptome under two temperature regimes, which would serve as a blueprint of gene expression profile. the work reports a strategy for de novo assembly of transcriptome using short-read sequence data generated by illumina rna-seq method. read per exon kilobase per million  based comparative expression profiling study was done to systematically characterize the mrnas at two temperatures and to identify the differentially regulated genes including those involved in picrosides biosynthesis. data on in silico gene expression was validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  as well using a set of  <dig> genes.

RESULTS
transcriptome represents the expressed portion of the genome and offers an overall view of the transcribed genes. it is a powerful tool in gene discovery and in understanding the biochemical pathways involved in physiological responses. various techniques such as microarray, serial analysis of gene expression and massively parallel signature sequencing emerged for high throughput gene expression profiling in the past and to allow for simultaneous interrogation of gene expression on a genome-wide scale  <cit> . however, these techniques are time consuming and become expensive, particularly for the analysis at global level. also, biases are introduced by the inevitable cloning step  <cit> .

with the advent of next generation sequencing technology, transcriptome analysis takes lesser time, cost and labour, and at the same time provides major sequence coverage and depth  <cit> . the technology has been used with success for the analysis of transcriptomes of several plant species including cajanus cajan  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , zea mays  <cit> , hordeum vulgare  <cit> , lycopersicum esculentum  <cit> , camellia sinenis  <cit> , and cicer arietinum  <cit> .

the present work was carried out on de novo transcriptome sequencing of p. kurrooa, de novo assembly of short reads, annotation of assembled sequences at 15°c and 25°c and validation of rpkm based expression analysis by rt-pcr using selected genes. p. kurrooa is a medicinally important and endangered plant species. medicinal properties are attributed to the monoterpenoids, picroside i and picroside ii, which are associated with hepatoprotective activity as one of the major activities  <cit> .

reads generation and de novo sequence assembly
the de novo assembly of short reads without a reference genome still remains a challenge in spite of the development of many bioinformatics tools for data assembly and analysis  <cit> . paired-end  run of  <dig> cycles, for each of the leaf tissues collected from plants exposed to 15°c and 25°c, was performed on illumina genome analyzer iix platform . bcl converter was used to produce the reads in qseq format of the pe run of genome analyzer. it contains reads, their coordinates, tile number and quality encoding. since 3' ends of reads are prone to sequencing error, for every  <dig> bp read, only  <dig> bases  were considered for further use. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> pe reads were generated at 15°c and 25°c, respectively. after performing quality filtering, a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> pe reads were obtained for 15°c and 25°c, respectively. in total  <dig> , <dig> pe reads were obtained.

in order to select the most appropriate k-mer size for considering de novo assembly, soapdenovo was run at different k-mer size ranging between <dig> to  <dig> mers, with read length of  <dig> bp  <cit> . the parameters recorded were the total transcripts obtained after assembling, average coverage, average transcript size, percentage of transcripts having length higher than  <dig>  bp and highest transcript length. k-mer size of  <dig> mer emerged as the best choice for performing assembly, as it had a balance between over-represented and under-represented transcript numbers, coverage, maximum length obtained and average transcript length . total number of transcripts decreased linearly with the increment of k-mer size suggesting over-representation at lower k-mer and under-representation at higher k-mers. it was observed that the sequences assembled at higher k-mer were enriched for transcripts with higher coverage/higher expression. for assembly process, only those reads were considered that produced high frequency k-mer. pe module was used to perform more sensitive assembling, and utilized pair information and approximate distance between pe reads . gap filling was opted to produce longer scaffolds from the pe reads data, mapping into the contigs as well as gapped regions. for all the assembling steps, minimum length cut-off for assembled transcripts was set to  <dig> bp.

the data from the two temperature conditions were assembled separately. for 15°c assembly, a total of  <dig>  assembled transcripts with average length of  <dig>  bp and average coverage of  <dig>  times was obtained . total  <dig>  assembled transcripts  had sequence length longer than  <dig>  bp with the longest assembled transcript of  <dig>  bp. similarly for 25°c,  <dig>  assembled transcript sequences were obtained with  <dig>  bp average length and average coverage of  <dig> . total  <dig>  sequences  were longer than  <dig>  bp with maximum sequence length of  <dig>  bp. the difference in the number of assembled transcripts generated for 15°c and 25°c could be the result of the stress response of the plants at high temperature  <cit> . it is also likely that such differences in the number of assembled transcripts could be due to the technological noise that might have crept in at some stage, as reported by previous work  <cit> . considering the quality of assemblies produced at two different temperatures, it appeared that increased read data could enhance the total coverage, average contig length and percentage of transcripts longer than  <dig> kb. therefore, pe reads of the two lanes  were combined, retaining the pe information. combined de novo assembly was carried out with  <dig> , <dig> filtered reads in pe form . with this approach, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were obtained, of which  <dig> % were above  <dig>  bp, yielding higher average coverage of  <dig> , average length of  <dig>  bp and maximum length of  <dig>  bp. therefore, total  <dig>  transcripts, generated from pooled reads, made the final representatives for assembled sequences in this study. the related read and sequence  data have been deposited at national centre for biotechnology information  in the short read archive  database and transcriptome shotgun assembly  database under the accession numbers sra <dig>  and jr808536-jr <dig>  respectively. those sequences, which were either less than  <dig> bp or had a stretch of "n" >  <dig> nucleotides were not accepted by tsa and hence were presented in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> which contains complete collection of assembled sequences.

the table shows assembly quality when assembled for reads generated at 15°c and 25°c, separately and by pooling the reads obtained at the two temperatures together. the best contigs were found for the pooled data having higher coverage and higher average transcript length

homology search and sequence clustering
set of assembled sequences contained several sequences sharing similarity, causing over-representation of data for total transcript sequence measurement. such redundancy and over-representation can be reduced by finding similar sequences either through merging them or by using a single representative sequence instead. this was done by applying sequence similarity based clustering. after performing hierarchical clustering with tigr gene indices clustering tools  using contig assembly program  and cluster database at high identity with tolerance , with minimum 90% similarity cut off, the number of unique assembled transcripts reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

analysis of sequences, obtained after clustering, was done for homology search against protein sequences at non-redundant  databases at ncbi by blastx with cut off e-value of 10- <dig>  for pooled read assembled transcript sequences, significant blast hits were found for a total of  <dig>  sequences while no hit was found for  <dig>  sequences.

another clustering step was carried out for sequences which returned significant blast hits. sequences with no apparent significant identity among themselves might belong to the different parts of the same gene or may represent the isoforms. counting them as separate transcripts would only inflate the number of unique genes. therefore, all those transcripts were searched that exhibited significant hits and shared the best hits to the same reference sequence. a set of local scripts was written to scan for all those assembled transcript sequences that returned a common best hit and common reference gene but differed in their location. all such transcripts were clustered together and assumed as the members of associated reference sequence/gene represented. this step reduced the total number of transcripts with significant blast hits, from  <dig>  to  <dig> . therefore, the number of actual unique genes is expected to be much lower than the total transcript sequences coming out of any de novo assembling tool. such clustering approach was applied in order to get the correct number of unique genes represented by the assembled transcripts sequences, which could be over-represented otherwise. a complete detail of grouped sequences has been made available in additional file  <dig>  related materials and associated annotations for sequences representing the group sequences as the best one is available at the url: http://scbb.ihbt.res.in/picro_information. remaining  <dig>  transcript sequences, with no significant homologous reference sequence, too could display the above mentioned clustering property and their total number might go lower than the observed. however, in this part of the study, orfs were derived in six frames of these unknown sequences and looked for possible functional domains across the conserved domain databases. interestingly, for  <dig>  sequences, a few significant conserved domains were identified. some of the highly represented domains were fibronectin attachment protein , large tegument protein, extensin-like, formin homology region  <dig>  tt-viral orf <dig>  cysteine-rich transmembrane module stress tolerance and fibrillarin . these hitherto unknown sequences might render the function characteristic to the domain.

validation of assembled sequences against the ests of p. kurrooa
the assembled sequences obtained from pooled reads were validated by sequence based alignments against ests of p. kurrooa submitted at ncbi dbest by our group. for  <dig> submitted ests , blastn analysis against the assembled transcripts was performed with an e-value threshold of 10- <dig>  the sequences were analyzed for mis-assemblies and manually checked for all alignment conditions. besides this, manual assessment of alignment for all transcripts with their blastx hits against protein nr databases at ncbi was also performed. significant hits were observed for  <dig> sequences , while no hit could be obtained for  <dig> ests from the assembled transcript set. also, most of the assembled transcript sequences were found to be aligned correctly and in continuous form, with average identity of  <dig> %, suggesting good assembly quality. the unmappable unigenes in p. kurrooa might include fusion transcripts, relatively short and low quality singletons, utr sequences far from the translation start or stop sites , and those having incomplete coverage by the genome. it has been reported that even in a. thaliana around 13% of the ests could not be aligned to the predicted genes  <cit>  and in human only 64% of the reads could be mapped to the refseq database of well annotated human genes  <cit> . detailed information regarding this part of analysis is mentioned at url http://scbb.ihbt.res.in/picro_information.

utilization of transcriptome data for analysis of guanine-cytosine  content and identification of simple sequence repeats  markers
next generation sequencing offered an opportunity for the analysis of gc content among unigenes and expanded the scope for molecular markers such as ssrs. gc content gives important indication about the genes and genomic composition including evolution, gene structure , gene regulation and is an indicator of stability of dna  <cit> . average gc content of p. kurrooa transcripts was  <dig> % , which is in range of gc levels of coding sequences in dicots   <cit> .

ssrs or microsatellites markers have diagnostic and functional significance, and have been usually associated with functional and phenotypic variations. ssrs are multi-allelic in nature, reproducible, highly abundant, cover the genome extensively and exhibit co-dominant inheritance. transcriptome ssr markers exhibit high interspecific transferability  <cit> . due to the limitation of genomic data available, est databases have been increasingly screened for development of genic ssrs  <cit> . p. kurrooa is a cross pollinated species and hence the seed raised population will have variability. variability in vegetative growth as well as for picrosides content of wild populations of p. kurrooa has also been reported  <cit> . also, considerable variation exists in picrosides content for plants collected from different locations  <cit> . the identification of ssrs in p. kurrooa will help in distinguishing closely related individuals and will also provide useful criteria for enriching and analyzing variation in the gene pool of the plant.

assembled transcript sequences of p. kurrooa were analyzed for these ssrs . a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified in the assembled transcripts. the trinucleotide ssrs have been observed to be the most prevalent group of markers  with highest occurrence of gaa, tgg, cca, aga, and tca repeats followed by mononucleotide  and dinucleotide  ssrs. most prevalent mononucleotide was poly-a while highest prevalent dinucleotide ssrs were poly-ag and poly-tc. the observed prevalence of poly-a could be due to the presence of poly-a tails of rna sequences. only a small fraction of tetra and penta ssrs were identified . in general, trinucleotide ssrs are the most common ones as compared to dinucleotides or tetranucleotides  <cit> .

functional annotation and classification of p. kurrooa transcriptome
for functional annotation of p. kurrooa transcriptome, transcripts were compared against the nr protein sequences available at uniprot database using blastx algorithm with e-value threshold of 10- <dig>  the associated hits were searched for their respective gene ontology , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and enzyme commission codes  for each query sequence and the highest bit score hit was selected. go terms are derived from dynamic controlled vocabularies or ontologies that can be used to describe the function of genes and gene products. annotation against go database yielded significant annotation for  <dig>  out of  <dig>  assembled sequences, representing the best possible hits. these genes were further classified into two major categories namely, biological process and molecular function using plant specific go slims that provide a broad overview of the ontology content. functional classification of p. kurrooa transcripts in biological process category  showed that metabolic process, transport, regulation of biological processes, response to stimulus and cellular process were among the highly represented groups indicating that the plant is undergoing rapid growth and extensive metabolic activity. genes involved in dna binding, catalytic and transferase activity were highly represented in molecular function category  indicating dominance of gene regulation, signal transduction and enzymatically active processes. genes involved in other important biological processes such as cell differentiation, communication, transport were also identified through go annotations. a comparison for distribution of transcripts across various go slim categories, between a. thaliana, p. kurrooa and m. truncatula showed no major differences between the ranks of go slim categories . however, comparison for distribution of top occurring go terms instead of go slim categories between p. kurrooa and a. thaliana suggested differential distribution of transcripts between various go categories .

best ec classification was obtained for  <dig>  assembled sequences, whereas associated kegg classification was obtained for  <dig>  assembled sequences. figure 2a lists the top  <dig> abundant enzyme classes observed for p. kurrooa transcriptome. interestingly, a large amount of assembled transcripts belonged to serine/threonine protein kinase enzyme class alone . besides this, figure 2b displays top  <dig> kegg pathways represented by the assembled transcriptome sequences. highest number of sequences belonged to plant-pathogen interaction pathways  followed by ribosome, spliceosome, protein processing and endoplasmic reticulum, starch and sucrose metabolism, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis, rna degradation and so on. highest represented groups included many pathways associated with housekeeping processes as well as plant development and secondary metabolism.

transcriptome analysis suggests modulation of major plant processes at two temperatures
one of the goals of transcriptome sequencing was to compare transcripts at 15°c and 25°c, the temperatures which modulate picrosides content  <cit> . our data was in line with the previous work that showed higher picrosides content at 15°c as compared to those at 25°c . genome wide analysis of gene expression at two temperatures was assessed using rpkm, where read-counts of a particular transcript represent expression level  <cit> . this approach was effective in detecting even scarcely expressed transcripts and was reported to be independent of prior knowledge of gene model, making it a natural choice to measure expression in the absence of known gene models and microarray chips. considering dissimilar sequence clustering to contain over-representation, go annotation for  <dig>  unique genes was obtained along with their rpkm values at the two temperatures. based on fold increment at 15°c, these genes were grouped into six different expression classes ranging from >  <dig> fold increment to  <dig>  fold or lower. highest number of genes fell into the group with minimum change in expression. a detailed breakup for each of such categories along with top  <dig> go categories for molecular function as well as biological process is listed in additional file  <dig>  molecular function groups representing monooxygenase activity, 2-iron, 2-sulfur cluster binding, cobalamin binding, beta lactamase activity, aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase activity, purine transmembrane transporter activity and metal ions like iron and copper binding activities were found to be over-expressed at 15°c. under the biological process groups, those associated with various biosynthesis and transport processes such as zinc and ammonium transport and protein chromophore linkage were prominent at 15°c. figure  <dig> and  <dig> represent the top  <dig> biological process and molecular function categories, respectively, present at two fold or higher expression groups at 15°c and 25°c. as can be seen from these diagrams, response to heat, response to biotic stimulus and lipid catabolic process were exclusively represented at 25°c. while at 15°c, categories for redox, glycogen biosynthetic process, biosynthetic processes and protein-chromophore linkage were exclusively represented. under the molecular function categories, monooxygenase activities, peptidase activities, catalytic activities, 2-sulfur, 2-iron cluster binding and protein binding activities were found to be more pronounced at 15°c, while pectinesterase and protein kinase activities were predominant at 25°c. a further enrichment analysis for functional categories pointed out that transcripts associated with response to stress, response to stimulus, phytosteroid metabolic process and brassinosteroid  metabolic process were significantly enriched in the group having two fold or higher expression at 25°c . brs are a group of plant steroidal hormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth and development, including cell elongation, photomorphogenesis, xylem differentiation, seed germination  <cit> , and adaptation to abiotic and biotic environmental stresses  <cit> . brs promote tolerance in plants against a wide range of stresses, including heat, cold, drought and salinity, possibly through up-regulating the expression of stress related genes  <cit> . compared to the expression at 15°c, up-regulation of stress responsive transcripts is suggestive of p. kurrooa to be under stress at 25°c. the above described global analysis of gene expression provided comprehensive dataset with each gene represented by its absolute expression level at the two temperatures. several processes such as metabolic processes, cellular processes, transport processes , and catalytic processes  were equally represented at both the temperatures indicating the importance of these processes in plant growth and survival; although different set of genes in these processes might determine the response of plant to temperature change. transcripts associated with the processes involving lipid metabolism were highly enriched at 25°c , suggesting a change in lipid profile. indeed, temperature has been shown to modulate lipid profile in plant  <cit> .

concomitant modulation of several plant processes suggests involvement of transcription factors  for coordinated regulation of gene expression. tfs are sequence specific dna-binding proteins that interact with the promoter regions of target genes and modulate gene expression. these proteins regulate gene transcription depending upon tissue type and in response to internal signals, for example plant hormones, and to external signals such as temperature, uv light, pathogen attack, and drought. in p. kurrooa,  <dig>  transcript sequences exhibited homology with tf families, which were reduced to  <dig>  after dissimilar sequence clustering . the most abundant tf families observed were for c3h, phd, mads, bhlh and myb-related family . of the  <dig>  transcription factors,  <dig> % exhibited 2-fold or higher abundance enrichment at 15°c . the most abundant tfs in this group were myb-related, far <dig>  fha, hb, bhlh, orphans, c3h, c2h <dig>  mads, g2-like, nac, snf <dig> and wrky. of the total tfs,  <dig> % exhibited abundance increment two fold or above at 25°c and belonged to c3h, mads, bhlh, phd and far <dig> family.

the above mentioned tfs have been associated with varied processes. for example, members of c3h family are involved in embryogenesis  <cit> , whereas phd proteins are found in nucleus and regulate chromatin-mediated transcription  <cit> . most members of mads family tfs are involved in the regulation of flower-related physiological and developmental processes  <cit> , whereas members of bhlh are involved in controlling cell proliferation and in the development of specific cell lineages  <cit> . far <dig>  yet another family of tfs, is involved in phytochrome signaling  <cit> .

it was interesting to note that global gene expression analysis exhibited modulation of processes which were responsive to heat, responsive to biotic stimulus, lipid catabolic process and glycogen biosynthetic process  at 25°c as compared to 15°c. members of tfs families such as bhlh, wrky, myb, ap2/erebp  <cit>  that are known to regulate the above processes, also exhibited modulation  in accordance with the said transcripts, suggesting their role in regulating the mentioned processes. p. kurrooa is a plant of high altitude temperate region which does not tolerate a continuous temperature greater than 20°c for a longer period of time  <cit> . a systematic analysis of these transcription factors would open door for imparting tolerance to p. kurrooa at high temperature . it would also be worthwhile to study, how such a temperature mediated transcriptomic adjustment affects picrosides biosynthesis.

pathways associated with picrosides biosynthesis exhibit temperature dependent modulation
since the two temperatures targeted in the present work modulated picrosides content, it was of interest to analyze various genes associated with picrosides biosynthesis. picrosides are terpenoids with an iridoid skeleton of monoterpene origin. depending upon the functional-group moieties, picrosides are classified as picroside i and picroside ii. picroside i has cinnamate moiety, whereas picroside ii has vanillate moiety. the cinnamate and vanillate moieties are derived from pp pathway . synthesis of cinnamate requires the action of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  on phenylalanine whereas caffeoyl-coa 3-o methyltransferase  is the key enzyme for vanillate biosynthesis  <cit> .

iridoid moiety is derived from geranyl pyrophosphate  . gpp is synthesized by sequential head to tail addition of isopentenyl pyrophosphate  and its allelic isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate   <cit> . cytosolic mva pathway and the plastid localized mep pathway synthesize ipp and dmapp  <cit> , with cross talks between these two pathways  <cit> . thus mva, mep and pp are regarded as central pathways for the synthesis of picrosides. mva pathway starts from the condensation of acetyl-coa  <cit> , whereas mep pathway needs pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  <cit> . biosynthesis of picrosides involves synthesis of iridoid moiety from gpp through series of oxidation and cyclization steps followed by the condensation of glucose moiety and cinnamate/vanillate with iridoid unit .

analysis of mva, mep and pp pathways have general implications as well. these are involved in the biosynthesis of large number of secondary metabolites including those having commercial implications. these compounds include taxol  <cit> , artemisinin  <cit> , β-carotene  <cit> , α-tocopherol  <cit> , vincristine, vinblastine and coumarins  <cit> . these pathways play important roles in growth and development including secondary metabolism, and hence identification of major regulatory steps would be key to modulate plant performance and secondary metabolism, if need be.

using blast analysis against the uniprot and kegg databases, various genes associated with mva, mep and pp pathways were identified. rpkm-based expression showed  <dig> fold increase for several genes of mep pathways at 15°c as compared to those at 25°c . data was in agreement with the data on picrosides content that showed its increased accumulation at 15°c . while a previous work on p. kurrooa also showed a positive correlation between pkdxs  and picrosides accumulation  <cit> , the present work detailed on all the genes of mep pathway highlighting their importance in picrosides accumulation .

rpkm data showed up-regulation of various genes of mva and pp pathway at 25°c as compared to those at 15°c . the accumulation of picrosides decreased at 25°c as compared to 15°c, whereas various genes of pp pathway exhibited up-regulation at 25°c. since pp pathway is important in supplying cinnamate and vallinate for picrosides biosynthesis, an up-regulation of various genes of the pathways were envisioned at 15°c as compared to 25°c. however the results were opposite, suggesting rerouting of the metabolites towards the synthesis of other metabolites at 25°c. and at 15°c, the observed expression of genes of the mva and pp pathway might be sufficient enough to meet the requirement of cinnamate and vanillate. in fact, increased activity of pal  in response to thermal stress was considered as an acclamatory response of cells to heat stress in citrulus vulgaris  <cit> . expression of various genes of pp pathway including pal is regulated by tf family lim. lim proteins have conserved cysteine-histidine rich, zinc-coordinating domain consisting of two zinc fingers repeated in tandem. in transgenic tobacco, down-regulating the expression of lim proteins through antisense approach lowered the expression of various genes of pp pathway  <cit> . in p. kurrooa, rpkm based expression analysis showed that the expression of lim was up-regulated at 25°c  suggesting its role in regulating pp pathway. thus at higher temperature, up-regulation of mva and pp pathways could have a role in temperature stress acclimation also.

transcriptome data identifies cytochrome p <dig>  and glycosyltransferases  as a source of hitherto unknown genes involved in the biosynthesis of picrosides
in p. kurrooa, the intermediates and enzymes involved in cyclization of gpp for the synthesis of iridoid moiety and later its condensation with glucose and cinnamate/vanillate moieties are yet to be deciphered. in vivo tracer studies in catharanthus roseus and lonicera morrowii showed that iridoid is synthesized by cyclization of 10-oxogeranial to yield iridoial  <cit> . this is subsequently converted into iridoid compounds via iridotrial intermediate, and involves multiple oxidation/hydroxylation and glycosylation reactions. most of the oxidative reactions, including hydroxylations, epoxidation, dealkylation, dehydration and carbon-carbon bond cleavage are catalyzed by cyp group of enzymes  <cit> , whereas glycosylation reactions are catalyzed by gts. therefore, it would be relevant to discuss cyps and gts in the transcriptome of p. kurrooa.

cyps are membrane bound hemoproteins involved in array of pathways in primary and secondary metabolism. some of the example of cyps include lauric acid hydroxylase, limonene-3-hydroxylases , -menthofuran synthase, geraniol hydroxylase, camphor-6-exo-hydroxylase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase , flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, flavones synthase 2- berbamunine synthase, tyrosine n-hydroxylase. based on phylogenetic studies, plant cyps can be divided into  <dig> separate clans that cover the current  <dig> families  <cit> .

monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes are intimately associated with cyps. for example, l0-hydroxylation of geraniol and nerol has long been known to be a cyp function  <cit> . allylic hydroxylation of cyclic monoterpenes by cyps is well documented. such reactions are known to occur in the hydroxylation of limonene  <cit> , pinene  <cit> , sabinene  <cit> , camphor  <cit> , abietin  <cit>  and terpeniol  <cit> . all the cyps associated with monoterpenes are divided into cyp <dig> clan. in the present study,  <dig> unigenes annotated as putative cyps were identified based on highest bitscore and e-value . sixteen of these cyps were identified as putative cyps. seventeen cyps exhibited homology with flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, cyp92a <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> nadph-reductase, cyp72a <dig>  cyp72a <dig>  cyp721a <dig>  coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase, aba 8'-hydroxylase cyp707a <dig>  cyp707a <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase cyp83g <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase cyp72a <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase cyp83e <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> cyp85a <dig>  cyp83b <dig>  cyp71at2v <dig>  and cytochrome p <dig> fatty acid omega-hydroxylase. ten cyps showed more than two fold increase in the expression and  <dig> cyps exhibited down-regulation, respectively at 15°c as compared to at 25°c. increased picrosides content  and up-regulation of cyps at 15°c suggested these to be the possible candidates associated with picrosides biosynthesis through their possible role in cyclization of gpp and iridoid moiety as indicated in figure  <dig> 

gts constitute a large family of enzymes that catalyze transfer of glycosyl group from activated sugars  to aglycone acceptor molecules, and regulate their bioactivity, solubility and transport  <cit> . gts are grouped into  <dig> families based on the substrate recognition and sequence relatedness, of which family  <dig> is the largest and is over-represented by uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases . ugts use udp-glucose as the donor in the gt catalyzed reactions  <cit> . therefore, the reactions involving transfer of glucose utilize ugts. ugts have 44-amino acid c-terminal signature motif designated as pspg box and are encoded by large multigene families, sometime comprising several hundred of genes. for example, family  <dig> ugts are encoded by  <dig> ugt genes in a. thaliana and by  <dig> ugts in m. truncatula  <cit> . the ugt superfamily in higher plants is thought to encode enzymes that glycosylate a broad array of aglycones, including plant hormones, all major classes of plant secondary metabolites, and xenobiotics such as herbicides  <cit> . picrosides are present as 1-o-glucosides and hence an analysis of ugts would be central to identify the gene associated with the glycosylation of iridoid moiety.

blast search identified  <dig> unigenes encoding gts, out which  <dig> encoded for ugts in p. kurrooa . expression of these  <dig> ugts through rpkm analysis showed that  <dig> ugts are up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated at 15°c as compared to those at 25°c. eleven ugts showed no significant change in expression at the two temperatures. up-regulation of picrosides at 15°c vis-à-vis up-regulation of  <dig> ugts suggests these to be the possible candidates associated with picrosides biosynthesis.

experimental validation of rpkm data by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
the expression profiles obtained through rpkm values were experimentally validated through rt-pcr using  <dig> genes belonging to mep, mva and pp pathways. rt-pcr data showed that all the  <dig> genes of mep pathway showed up-regulation at 15°c and the similar trend was obtained by rpkm data as well .

rt-pcr showed up-regulation of hmgr, mevalonate kinase  and phosphomevalonate kinase  of mva pathway and comt of pp pathway at 15°c. however, rpkm data exhibited up-regulation of these genes at 25°c. expression of acetyl-coa acetyltransferase  did not exhibit any significant variation at the two temperatures as evidenced by rt-pcr and rpkm data. expression of gps  was prominent at 15°c as compared to 25°c with  <dig> fold increase as per the rt-pcr data ; rpkm based expression analysis also confirmed the same trend .

it was encouraging to note that except for pal, 4-ch, comt, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa synthase, hmgr, mvk, pmk, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, the expression of rest of the  <dig> genes as analyzed by rpkm and rt-pcr was in accordance with each other. the different trend of expression by rpkm and rt-pcr method has been reported by other groups as well  <cit> . the possibility of opposite results by the two methods could be due to the reasons that genome analyzer provides a holistic picture of all the isoforms of a gene into consideration, whereas the expression by rt-pcr is specific to the isoform of the gene into consideration owing to the use of gene specific primers.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, transcriptome for leaf tissue of p. kurrooa was generated and analyzed for the plants kept at 15°c and 25°c with a total of  <dig>  assembled sequences. pe read data along with optimized parameters and suitable multiple assembling and clustering approaches were used to find out non-inflated number of assembled transcript sequences with high coverage and average length. the similarity and overlap based similarity search and assembling might result into inflated number of assembled sequences, many of which could be either from different parts of the same gene or the isoforms. the dissimilar sequence clustering approach used in the present work helped to overcome the above problems to a large extent and reduced over-representation of assembled sequences. go, kegg and ec based tools and scripts were used for sequence annotation. transcriptome data exhibited gc content representative of a dicot genome and also abundance of trinucleotide ssr markers was evident. rpkm based expression analysis by comparing transcriptomes at two temperatures showed major adjustments reflecting changes in major biological processes and metabolic pathways including the pathways associated with picrosides biosynthesis. a number of novel candidate genes involved in picrosides biosynthesis, including cyps and ugts were also identified, which could serve as a source of hitherto uncharacterized genes associated with picrosides biosynthesis. transcriptome data generated in the present work has immense implications in understanding plant response at two temperatures, marker assisted selection, and metabolic engineering in an economically important, medicinal and endangered plant species p. kurrooa.
