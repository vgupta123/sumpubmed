BACKGROUND
complex interactions between gram-negative bacteria and their environment are facilitated by numerous surface-attached and exported macromolecules, some of which represent bacterial toxins and effectors. in order to cross two bacterial membranes, those molecules are transported by nanomachineries, called secretion systems, which may be more or less complex in terms of their composition and regulation. up to recently, five distinct secretion systems have been identified in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . in  <dig>  two groups presented evidences on the existence of a novel secretion system in vibrio cholerae  <cit>  and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , and named it the type vi secretion system .

both systems export the hcp  and presumably a class of proteins named vgr , whose exact function is still speculative. in v. cholerae, three vgrs  are encoded in the genome, and are exported in a t6ss-dependent way. all n-terminal domains of vgr proteins show strong homology with bacteriophage t <dig> proteins gp <dig> and gp <dig>  which are constituents of phage baseplate  <cit> , and are able to co-associate  <cit> . on the contrary, the c-terminal domains are vgr-specific and some of them seem to carry an "activity" function, as illustrated by v. cholerae vgrg <dig> which can cross-link cellular actin  <cit> .

the genes encoding t6ss have been reported a few years ago as being present in different bacterial species, although it was not clear at that time whether those genes act together or are important in bacteria-host interactions  <cit> . recent reports demonstrated the importance of t6ss in pathogenesis of several bacterial species. burkholderia mallei uses t6ss to proliferate in macrophages and an hcp-related protein is produced in vivo during infection of model animals  <cit> . the fish pathogen edwardsiella tarda has an active t6ss  <cit> . hcp <dig> of p. aeruginosa is actively secreted by clinical isolates and cystic fibrosis patients develop antibodies against hcp, demonstrating that the system is active during infection  <cit> . in addition to vgr and hcp proteins, the actual hallmark of this novel system is the presence of an aaa+ clp-like atpase and of two additional genes icmf and dotu, encoding homologs of t4ss stabilising proteins  <cit> .

as in the case of the majority of virulence factors, the expression of t6ss is tightly controlled either at transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. one of the four t6ss encoded in the genome of b. mallei, found to be required for virulence in the hamster model of infection, is under the control of the virag two-component system and an arac-type regulator  <cit> . the expression of the t6ss of burkholderia cenocepacia and p. aeruginosa is regulated by a similar sensor kinase containing seven transmembrane domains and belonging to the 7tmr-dismed  protein family  <cit> . finally, the activity of t6ss of p. aeruginosa is regulated by a ser/thr kinase and phosphatase able to act on the fha -containing component of the machinery  <cit> .

all together, these findings provide strong evidence that the t6ss is important for bacterial pathogenesis. however, as a new secretion system, little information is available about the structural and the genomic organization of the t6ss apparatus considering the vast amount of microbial genomic data available. the first in silico study, carried out in  <dig>  reported the presence of  <dig> homologs of icmf gene within  <dig> bacterial genomes belonging to the gram-negative proteobacteria division  <cit> . in that study, the phylogenetic analysis performed on three proteins  from the iahp  cluster suggested that some bacteria acquired this cluster by lateral transfer. this was further confirmed through a phylogenetic analysis of two other conserved protein sequences   <cit> . recently, a similar study based on ortholog search and focused on functional annotation  <cit>  detected t6ss in  <dig> pathogenic proteobacteria. however, the approach that was employed could not detect if there are more than one t6ss per genome. thus, in order to investigate thoroughly t6ss regarding its phylogenetic distribution, gene content, organization and evolution we undertook a large-scale genome screening approach by designing an in silico strategy using more than  <dig> available bacterial genomes. finally, some specific topics are discussed, such as the vgrg protein family and their potential role in host-pathogen interaction.

RESULTS
conserved t6ss primary core building and genome wide scanning
first, a list of the  <dig> conserved genes encoded in t6ss gene clusters demonstrated to be functional in virulence have been manually established . they are characterized by  <dig> different cogs . thus, each cog  was used as a bait to retrieve potential t6ss encoding regions from the  <dig> complete genomic sequences of the genome reviews repository . the retrieved genomic regions are referred later in the text as t6ss encoding regions or t6ss loci. we were able to identify  <dig> different loci from  <dig> different bacteria.

conserved t6ss homologs together with gene and cog names, encoded in experimentally studied t6ss. apseudomonas aeruginosa ; bvibrio cholerae ; crhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii imp gene locus, complete sequence; dsalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium dna for centisome  <dig> genomic island; eedwardsiella tarda strain ppd130/ <dig> putative transporting atpase and hypothetical proteins genes, complete cds; type vi secretion system gene cluster; fburkholderia pseudomallei ; gburkholderia mallei ; haeromonas hydrophila . not included in tab: escherichia coli ec <dig>   <cit> , francisella tularensis tularensis    <cit> 

each selected locus contained at least five genes predicted to encode proteins showing significant similarities  with the list of the  <dig> bait cogs. in order to estimate the degree of conservation of each cog in t6ss, we counted the number of loci where the cog was detected. a group of  <dig> cogs with frequency higher than 70% is clearly identified . all of these cogs were previously identified in the eight experimentally characterized t6ss, except the cog <dig> which corresponds to the hcp <dig> protein that is absent in the v. cholerae locus, albeit located elsewhere within its genome.

to estimate the ability of these  <dig> cogs to specifically predict t6ss, we investigated their phylogenetic distribution. eleven cogs are found only in organisms where at least one t6ss locus has been predicted. therefore, they appear specific to this secretion system. among the two remaining cogs, cog <dig> shows a clear correlation with t6ss associated organisms but is also present in other groups of bacteria including bacteroides . on the contrary, cog <dig>  is clearly not specific to t6ss and picks up different sub-families of bacterial atpases. a previous phylogenetic tree constructed by schlieker et al., which includes homologs of clpb and clpv atpases, discriminates clearly the two subfamilies  <cit> . however, the cog <dig> is not specific enough to perform this discrimination.

t6ss taxonomic distribution
the taxonomic distribution of t6ss was deduced from the phyla associated to the different bacteria harbouring at least one t6ss gene cluster. all but two of the bacterial species  belong to proteobacteria, in agreement with results published recently  <cit> . it is noteworthy, that among the  <dig> epsilon proteobacteria genomes, only helicobacter hepaticus presents a unique predicted t6ss. in addition, this cluster seems to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer . therefore, it appears that t6ss is mainly found in proteobacteria, except in the epsilon sub-group. the rarity of t6ss in the epsilon sub-group may be due to specific traits of this later group as it branches at the root of the proteobacterial phylogenetic tree  <cit> .

description and functional association of most conserved t6ss components
among the  <dig> most conserved proteins, icmf and dotu  have firstly been studied in the context of t4ss secretion and have been shown to be necessary for efficient t4ss-dependent secretion. icmf homologs are predicted to have three transmembrane helices hence most probably associated with bacterial membranes. both proteins have been shown to be required for t4ss apparatus stabilization in legionella pneumophilla  <cit> .

the clpv homologs  belong to a sub type of atpase aaa+ family, being specific to t6ss gene clusters  <cit> . this group lacks the disaggregating function found in the clpb type, but it is still able to take part into translocation processes. therefore, it has been proposed that clpv proteins provide energy to the protein secretion process  <cit> . indeed, clpv is essential for a t6ss function  <cit> .

in francisella, igla and iglb  are cytoplasmic proteins which interact directly and are required for intracellular growth in macrophages  <cit> . the authors propose that the iglab complex plays a role of chaperone-like proteins involved in secretion pathway of virulence factors. indeed, homologous proteins in vibrio, named vipa et vipb, form complexes and interact with clpv  <cit> .

vgrg and hcp proteins, both identified as conserved in t6ss loci, have been found in culture supernatant in t6ss dependent manner, in various organisms. however, it is still an ongoing debate whether these two proteins are constituents of the t6ss apparatus or are involved in translocation into host cell or are toxic per se. besides, pukatzki and co-workers hypothesized that three vgrg proteins assemble into a membrane-penetrating device whose structure is analogous to the bacteriophage t <dig> tail spike complex. indeed, vgrgs seem to be a fusion of phage tail proteins gp <dig> and gp <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, another protein , present in most of the analyzed loci, shows weak similarities to a second bacteriophage t <dig> protein . the quaternary structure of the bacteriophage t <dig> baseplate suggests that gp <dig> and gp <dig> are in close proximity in the baseplate and may physically interact  <cit> . however, in edwardsiella tarda, yeast two-hybrid experiments do not detect any interaction between evpi  and evpe . although, the Δevpe mutant shows defect in the secretion of evpc , evpe itself does not appear to be secreted  <cit> .

to further characterize functional links that may exist between t6ss components, we decided to focus on the conserved genomic organization, as it often suggests co-translation and/or protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the genomic organization among t6ss loci was investigated by computing the number of loci in which every pair of cogs could potentially be co-transcribed . as shown on figure  <dig>  it clearly appears that t6ss gene clusters are strongly biased in their organization suggesting that these  <dig> proteins are part of a small-scale network of physical and functional interactions. from this analysis, three groups of conserved organization can be clearly delineated:

• cog <dig> , cog <dig>  and cog <dig> . as mentioned previously, the complex iglab may play a role of chaperone-like proteins involved in secretion pathway.

• cog <dig> , cog <dig> , cog <dig>  and cog <dig> . sequence analyses performed on those proteins reveal: i) a predicted signal peptide in 86% of the sequences associated to cog <dig>  ii) one predicted transmembrane helix but no signal peptide in 87% of the dotu sequences, iii) three transmembrane helices in 63% of the icmf sequences  and iv) no signal peptide or transmembrane segment in all cog <dig> sequences. the results obtained on dotu and icmf proteins are in accordance with experiments conducted in the context of t4ss. moreover, recent experiments in e. coli have confirmed the lipoprotein function of scin, the protein of the t6ss locus retrieved by the cog <dig>  <cit> .

• cog <dig> , cog <dig>  and cog <dig> . most of the sequences associated to these cogs have neither a predicted signal peptide nor transmembrane helix, suggesting that they might be cytoplasmic proteins.

t6ss phylogenetic analysis and profiles
in order to identify sub-groups of t6ss, we performed a phylogenetic analysis on the t6ss encoding loci. a tree was built on sequences of each protein family found at the different loci. then, the trees were compared in order to decide whether or not they can be considered as the result of a single evolutionary scenario, i.e., if the core genes we identified co-evolved and have been transmitted  as a single functional unit. the similarities between the trees were computed using topd/fmts  <cit>  with the split distance . a hierarchical classification was applied on these distances. it suggests that the set of trees is homogenous as it is not possible to clearly identify different groups of trees in the resulting dendrogram . nevertheless, among the  <dig> trees, the ones associated to hcp , vgrg , cog <dig>  and another protein of unknown function  show the greatest distances to the other trees. as these four trees correspond to proteins either secreted  or exposed to the cell surface , their relative differences may be explained by a higher rate of mutation probably due to their direct interaction with environment or host cells. we thus decided to discard them for further computations. using the weighted mrp method  <cit> , we combined these trees to reconstruct a super-tree that would reflect a consensual scenario of t6ss evolution . besides being acknowledge to give accurate results  <cit> , the weighted mrp method also offers the possibility to integrate in a unique tree all loci, even if they share only a few common genes.

in the super-tree, each leaf corresponds to one of the  <dig> t6ss loci. first, the clusters of loci obtained on the tree were analyzed in terms of cog contents. we have defined five sub-groups  according to the tree topology and the presence or absence of conserved accessory proteins. the four t6ss groups proposed by bingle and co-workers  have been placed on the super-tree  <cit> . the loci corresponding to these four groups belong to four different clusters on the tree. therefore, the two classification obtained through different approaches are in agreement. however, we demonstrated here that it extends to the  <dig> core genes that can then be considered as one single functional unit. the analysis of our resulting tree can also give more insights regarding t6ss evolution. from the tree topology and the gene content of each locus, we can infer that some t6ss have been split into two different loci after their acquisition by the bacteria. indeed, both loci are clustered on the tree and their gene contents are complementary, forming a complete t6ss . as the two split loci found in hahella chejuensis localized distantly on the tree and belong to two different sub-groups , they should have been acquired through two independent events followed by gene lost. on the other hand, leaf clustering can also reveal recent duplications of t6ss gene clusters. we can detect two such events, one in pseudomonas putida  and the other in the common ancestor of yersinia pestis and yersinia pseudotuberculosis . in both cases, gene lost in one of the duplicated cluster is observed. the tree also highlights a large fraction of organisms that possess multiple t6ss gene clusters . some of these clusters are either incomplete or with different gene contents. the most striking examples come from the pathogenic bacteria yersinia pestis and burkholderia pseudomallei that encode up to six t6ss gene clusters. the distant location on the tree of the different loci suggests that these duplication events are not recent. given that these copies are ancient, belong to different sub-groups, and have been fixed, we can make the hypothesis that they may have specialized into specific functions.

furthermore, a strong correlation between the loci gene content and some subtrees can be observed. cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig> and cog <dig> cluster together in different sub-trees. interestingly, three of these cogs correspond to proteins involved in the post-translational regulation mechanism of the t6ss in pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> : ppka , pppa , and fha <dig> . except in sub-group i, the correlation is even more pronounced between cog <dig> and fha <dig> , which may indicate a functional role of cog <dig> in the ppka/pppa/fha regulatory pathway. the association between cog <dig>  and fha <dig>  has already been reported in a gene co-occurrence/gene neighbourhood study  <cit> . however, in our case, this association is not always strictly observed.

the sub-groups ii and iv can be characterized by the co-occurrence of two cogs: cog <dig> proteins') and cog <dig> . as the domain encoded by cog <dig> appears fused with the n-terminal domain of a sub-group of vgrg proteins , the observed correlation could reflect a possible interaction between the cog <dig> protein and vgrg through the cog <dig> domain. a putative role of this interaction could be the modulation of the vgrg function .

to further explore the specificities of sub-trees in terms of sequence conservation, we compared our tree with a clustering obtained on the proteins by applying the tribemcl strategy  <cit>  which is based only on sequence similarities . this alternative approach is mainly useful to correlate some of the sub-trees with the presence of specific cogs: cog <dig> , cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig>  moreover, another important feature revealed by the tribemcl clustering is the definition of a small sequence cluster whose members are mainly associated to cog <dig>  . loci belonging to that cluster are mainly found in the previously defined sub-group i  that contains the v. cholera locus whose regulation does not depend of the ppka/pppa/fha mechanism described for p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the cog <dig> member of the v. cholerae locus corresponds to the sigma  <dig> activator  <cit> , which is conserved in aeromonas hydrophila and has been shown to be necessary for t6ss expression in that organism <cit> .

all together, these observations suggest that i) the genes whose products are involved in the assembly of the putative secretion apparatus are well conserved through evolution, and ii) the bacteria evolved different regulatory components for the expression of those genes probably for specific bacterial adaptation to its host and/or niche.

regarding the deep branches of our tree, no common topology can be found with the bacterial taxonomy, some sub-trees appearing more correlated with ecological niches, as illustrated for marine bacteria , plant pathogens/symbionts  or animal pathogens. in addition, many observations favour the hypothesis that t6ss may be acquired by horizontal transfer as they belong to genomic islands gained by such a mechanism. this has been reported for: i) helicobacter hepaticus where the t6ss gene cluster belongs to the large hhgi <dig> genomic island that has been shown to be required for the induction of liver disease  <cit> , ii) photobacterium profundum where the genes coding for t6ss are found in region chr <dig>  which is probably horizontally acquired and absent from strain 3tck of p. profundum  <cit> , iii) the uropathogenic escherichia coli o <dig> strain upec/o6:h1/atcc 700928/cft <dig>  where one of the two t6ss gene clusters is encoded in the genomic island pai-cft073-metv  <cit> , and iv) the enterohaemorrhagic e. coli o157:h <dig> where it is located in the genomic island oi# <dig>  <cit>  whereas no t6ss footprint was found in the non pathogenic e. coli k <dig> 

is fpi a true t6ss?
in two recent papers, nano and coworkers  <cit>  argued that the fpi  locus might encode a t6ss. igla and iglb were shown to interact, and igla was found as crucial for intracellular growth of francisella. the same authors also identified an fpi encoded protein that presents similarity to members of the dotu protein family and another fpi encoded protein with a part of the conserved domain associated with the icmf protein family. intriguingly, the phylogenetic analysis of bingle and coworkers  <cit> , based exclusively on igla and iglb sequences, showed that francisella sequences clustered together in a deep branch of the tree, and our approach did not identify any t6ss locus in francisella. in order to investigate this discrepancy, each gene product of the fpi was used as query with the psiblast program against the ncbi non-redundant protein databank. for each protein, functional domain detection was achieved through an rpsblast search  <cit>  against the cog database. the complete results are summarized in a supplementary table . ten out of the  <dig> proteins show no similarity with any sequence of the databank, except with fpi encoded proteins from other strains of francisella. among the remaining proteins, only three exhibit significant sequence similarities to t6ss core genes: igla, iglb and pigf, an homolog of motb/ompa/dotu. we also confirmed that the pdpb sequence presents a similarity in its c-terminal region with the c-terminal fragment of the cog <dig> . we were unable to find any protein showing significant similarity with the t6ss dependent secreted protein, neither hcp nor vgr in all available francisella genomes.

these results suggest that the fpi would not encode a t6ss similar to the recently described t6ss but may rather encode another system implied in bacterial virulence that shares some components with both t6ss and t4ss. ongoing functional and structural studies on orphan proteins encoded in the fpi , and the determination of the macromolecular complex encoded by this island should help to better classify and understand this putative secretion system.

focus on vgrg proteins
in addition to secreted hcp whose function is still unclear, t6ss export a class of vgrg proteins. vgrg proteins have been proposed to bind/puncture target eukaryotic cells in order to deliver effector domains encoded within their c-terminal regions  <cit> . to further examine this hypothesis, we looked for conserved features and/or domains in the c-terminal regions of the vgrg proteins identified in all the t6ss loci reported above.

full length t6ss encoded vgrg proteins were selected according to the rpsblast analysis performed previously : only proteins showing an alignment covering at least 80% of the cog <dig> pssm with an e-value ≤ 10- <dig> were retained. we ended up with a set of  <dig> proteins with length ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. as previously reported and suggested by their nomenclature val-gly-repeats  <cit> , the vgrg proteins were already known for containing repeats in their c-terminal part. systematic search for short length amino acid tandem repeats in c-terminal regions identified  <dig> vgrg sequences having such repeats . their sequences were compared both at the dna and amino acid levels. when reported on the super-tree built on the t6ss loci, these proteins belongs to two distinct groups, except for two of them  that remained un-clustered . the first group is characterized by vgrg sequences whose repeats are highly conserved both at the protein and dna levels, implying that they are recent. the second group corresponds to vgrg repeats that are no more detectable at the dna level, but with a period and some amino acids strongly conserved at specific positions, suggesting that a selective pressure is acting in order to keep these repeated motifs functional. the vgrg sequences belonging to the two un-clustered loci present the same characteristics than the ones of the second group. all the species harbouring such vgrg proteins are animal pathogens. it strongly suggests that these repeats may be involved in virulence.

in the  <dig> remaining proteins, an rpsblast search was performed on their c-terminal regions and hits with an e-value ≤ 10- <dig> were retained. similarity with the cog <dig> , already reported for vc_a <dig> of v. cholera  <cit> , was not found in other vgrg proteins. on the other hand, we found significant similarities between the cog <dig>  and the c-terminal regions of fifty vgrg proteins, all issued from beta or gamma proteobacteria. among them, the two sequences from the two burkholderia cenocepacia available strains present a partial additional hit in their c-terminal part with the cog <dig> , known to be a component of the t4ss. the c-terminal regions of the remaining  <dig> vgrg proteins do not contain any identified conserved domain, but share, for some of them, sequence similarities. therefore, it appears that the vgrg proteins found in t6ss loci are mainly characterized by the presence, in their c-terminal part, of either repeats or cog <dig> functional domain. indeed, more than one third of the vgrg proteins possess one of these two features. these two domains have been predicted by pukatzki and coworkers as being structurally similar to putative adhesive molecules fibronectin-, yidb-, yada- or tropomyosin-like  <cit> . a detailed manual sequence comparison of eight vgrg proteins listed in their publication showed that four of them contained either repeats or cog <dig> at their c-terminal ends.

in conclusion, as vgrg proteins are suspected to be in contact with host cells, these c-terminal domains  may be involved in host cell adhesion or virulence. however, their role in secretion, translocation or virulence needs to be experimentally documented.

CONCLUSIONS
our screening approach has revealed the presence of complete t6ss gene clusters in more than  <dig> bacterial genomes. despite the increasing number of sequenced genomes, this secretion system appears to be confined to proteobacteria. we have clearly identified a core of  <dig> genes highly conserved and specific of t6ss. through a phylogenetic reconstruction of the t6ss loci and the analysis of phylogenetic profiles, subtypes of t6ss have been defined. they appear to have evolved different regulatory mechanisms necessary for bacterial adaptation to specific environments and/or hosts.

the comparative genomic approach highlights a highly conserved genomic organization of three groups of genes among the  <dig> core t6ss genes, and suggests that the proteins they encode may physically interact or form functionally important complexes. the first group  might constitute the membrane component of the basal secretion apparatus. the second group, composed of cog <dig> , cog <dig>  and cog <dig> , may direct a more efficient processing of unfolded proteins – in particular unfolded and unassembled hcp proteins – by the chaperon-like proteins igla-iglb. indeed, the last group contains three proteins  of unknown function that have been proposed to be part of the secretion apparatus  <cit> . one of its members  has similarities with the phage gp <dig> protein. it has been suggested that gp <dig> and gp <dig> are in close proximity in the baseplate and may physically interact  <cit> . as the n-terminal domain of vgrg is similar to gp <dig>  both domains may also interact in t6ss.

among the  <dig> core proteins, the secreted vgrg proteins are suspected to carry effector domains at their c-terminal end. we found that vgrg proteins are mainly characterized by the presence of repeats or of the functional domain cog <dig> of unknown function that have been suggested to promotes adhesion to host cell  <cit> .

one striking feature of this secretion system is that multiple copies of almost complete loci are found in about one third of the genomes harbouring such a system. our phylogenic tree reveals that they do not result from recent duplication events and have been conserved through evolution, suggesting a sustained and constrained mechanism that favoured this trend. on one hand, the high number of t6ss gene clusters found in various pathogenic bacteria  may be explained by a specialization of the secretion system by means of regulatory mechanisms and targets. on the other hand, the presence of t6ss clusters in non-pathogenic bacteria suggests that t6ss involvement is not limited to virulence, but that it may also be implicated in functions such as host/symbiont communication, exchange and cell-cell communication. for instance, in acinetobacter baylyi adp <dig>  the knock-out of t6ss genes display a strong phenotype on colony growth depending on various carbon sources, suggesting a putative role of t6ss in a cascade of events leading, when not functional, to membrane or cell adhesion disorders  <cit> .

no consensual model for the assembly of the type vi secretion machinery has emerged yet . these divergences emphasize the need for further experiments to get a better characterization of each t6ss components as well as defining the protein complexes building up the system. our results bring new functional hypothesis that could be tested experimentally and enrich our knowledge on this poorly understood secretion system.
