BACKGROUND
granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor is a cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and the differentiation of myeloid precursors  <cit>  and has been in clinical use for more than  <dig> years in indications related to counteracting chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or for bone-marrow transplantations  <cit> . we and others discovered that g-csf also acts as a growth factor in the brain, and shows protective and regenerative properties in a number of cns disease models  <cit> . the mechanisms leading to these beneficial effects likely include a combination of anti-apoptotic activity on neurons  <cit> , stimulation of neurogenesis  <cit> , enhancement of vessel formation  <cit> , mobilization of bone marrow derived cells  <cit>  and systemic anti-inflammatory effects  <cit> . recently we described that g-csf was protective in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , the major adult-onset motoneuron disease. g-csf treatment increased survival and volume of spinal α motoneurons and protected motoneuronal cell lines  in vitro against apoptotic stimuli  <cit> . importantly, while adult motoneurons prominently express the receptor for g-csf  <cit>  our studies did not unequivocally show that g-csf exerted protection in this als model through its neuroprotective activity.

here, we sought to determine whether g-csf was able to protect motoneurons in vivo in a model of neonatal sciatic nerve axotomy. this experimental paradigm has been largely described, is thought to rely almost exclusively on the apoptotic machinery  <cit> , and provides a powerful tool to study the neuroprotective activity of growth factors towards motoneurons in vivo  <cit> .

RESULTS
the g-csf receptor is expressed on neonatal motoneurons, and induced by axotomy
we have previously shown that the receptor of g-csf  is expressed on motoneurons in the adult spinal cord. we first determined whether the g-csf receptor was expressed on motoneurons during early postnatal development. at postnatal day  <dig>  we noted expression of the receptor on α motoneurons in the spinal cord ventral horn, identified by the following criteria: choline-acetyltransferase  expression, an identifiable nucleolus, and a size larger than  <dig> μm <dig> in the horizontal dimension . invariably, all motoneurons defined by these criteria expressed the receptor.

the expression of g-csf receptor is induced by neurons under neurodegenerative conditions such as after cerebral ischemia or in als, presumably as an endogenous protective response  <cit> . we therefore examined expression of the g-csf receptor by quantitative pcr of whole spinal cords  <dig> days following neonatal axotomy of the right sciatic nerve . indeed, we found that g-csfr expression in the whole spinal cord increased by 55%  .

to clarify whether this induction likely originated from the injured motoneurons, we quantified fluorescent staining intensities of ipsi- and contralateral motoneurons from the lumbar spinal cord region. we detected significantly stronger protein expression on ipsi- versus contralateral motoneurons, suggesting that axotomized motoneurons upregulate the receptor in response to injury  .

in conclusion, the g-csf receptor is expressed at the neonatal stage and its expression is increased in response to axotomy.

cns- targeted overexpression of g-csf protects motoneurons against cell death in neonatal pups
neonatal motoneuron death following sciatic nerve axotomy constitutes a widely used and well- established model of apoptotic motoneuron death that has been used to examine protective effects of trophic factors.

we chose to use transgenic mice that overexpress g-csf in the cns as an endogenous "delivery system" to study effects of increased concentration of g-csf on the lesioned motoneurons. we used transgenic mice harbouring a bidirectional tta-responsive construct with expression cassettes for murine g-csf and eyfp . these mice were crossed with mice expressing the tet-transactivator under control of the camkii α;-promoter, similar to the approach used in pitzer et al. except for the use of the thy1-driver used therein  <cit> . in the following we compare three types of transgene combinations in littermates derived from crosses of mice heterozygous for the transgene camkii-tta and heterozygous for pbeg. the three groups are a.) mice not harbouring any transgene , b.) mice harbouring only the beg <dig> transgene , and c.) mice harbouring both the beg <dig> transgene and the camkii-tta driver, that do express g-csf.

although expression via the camkii driver in our transgenes is mainly in the forebrain, release of g-csf in the spinal cord is expected from long corticospinal axonal connections. indeed, the camkiiα;-promoter directed g-csf overexpression in the forebrain leads to a strong elevation of g-csf levels in the neonatal brain and spinal cord  .

offspring from crosses of beg and camk-tta transgenic mice were subjected to complete unilateral sciatic nerve axotomy at postnatal day  <dig> . we analyzed effects on motoneuron survival in the lumbar section of the spinal cord  after  <dig> days at p <dig>  examples of the histological appearance of chat positive cells in the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord of neonatal mice after sciatic nerve axotomy are given in figure  <dig>  our axotomy model results in a loss of approximately  <dig> - 50% of motoneurons  <dig> days after the injury , a result consistent with other studies  <cit> . already apparent from the histological sections was that clearly more motoneurons survive in mice with the g csf transgene activated by the camk-tta driver  .

we then quantified numbers of motoneurons in the lumbar spinal cord of p <dig> neonatal mice contra- and ipsilateral to the side of axotomy. the α motoneurons were defined as  being situated in the ventral horn of the lumbar region;  having a clearly identifiable nucleolus and staining positive for chat and  having a minimum cross-sectional area of  <dig> μm <dig> 

there was no difference between the absolute numbers of motoneurons on the contralateral side between the three genotypes used, although there was a non-significant trend for slightly higher numbers in the double-transgenic group  vs. beg -/t camk-/-  and wt ; p =  <dig>  by anova) . on the axotomized side, sciatic nerve axotomy dramatically decreased the numbers of motoneurons in animals lacking the camk-tta driver transgene, whereas double transgenic animals showed significantly higher numbers of surviving motoneurons  . we also directly compared the fraction of surviving motoneurons relative to the unlesioned side . this analysis revealed that only  <dig> - 60% of the motoneurons survived in the genotypes lacking the camk-tta driver transgene, whereas close to 90% of the motoneurons survived in the double transgenic mice   vs. beg -/t camk-/-  and wt ; p <  <dig>  by anova and fisher's lsd post-hoc analysis).

g-csf preserves motoneuron size after axotomy
our previous results in als mice had shown that the shrinking of motoneurons in the sod <dig> transgenic mice was partially restored by g-csf treatment. to determine whether this was also the case after sciatic nerve axotomy, we studied the distribution of motoneuron size of all motoneurons including those that are <  <dig> μm <dig> determined by their cross-sectional area in the horizontal plane in all cells that were situated in the ventral horn, had a nucleolus, and were chat-positive. on the contralateral side, size distribution was similar between the three genotypes ; beg -/t camk -/- ; wt ; p =  <dig>  by anova).

on the ipsilateral  side, there was a downward shift in the mean size of the motoneurons in the littermates that did not overexpress g-csf . on the contrary, double transgenic animals  displayed a relatively preserved motoneuron size, suggesting a healthier state of those cells ; beg -/t camk -/- ; wt ; p <  <dig> ; anova followed by fisher's lsd). this result was also obtained if we only consider the α motoneurons that were counted for determining cell survival :  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig> ;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig> ;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig> ; p =  <dig>  by anova. additional file  <dig> shows a histogram distribution of motoneurons contra- and ipsilateral to the axotomy. a detailed summary of all data measured is given in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
here we show that the receptor for g-csf is expressed by neonatal motoneurons and that g-csf protects lumbar motoneurons in a model of neonatal sciatic nerve axotomy. we have chosen this model because of the clarity of the involved pathophysiology to obtain more insight into the nature of g-csf's effect on motoneurons. sendtner et al. first described rescue of motoneuron death caused by neonatal axotomy by the growth factor cntf  <cit> . this was followed by demonstration of a number of other neurotrophic factors protective in this paradigm. a series of papers then defined this axotomy-induced motoneuron death as apoptosis, with involvement of bcl proteins, akt, iaps, and caspases  <cit> . overexpression of g-csf protects lumbar motoneurons to an extent that is comparable to many of the classic neurotrophic factors. the experiments done here are therefore a further step in redefining g-csf as a neurotrophic factor.

on top of a relative increase of motoneuron numbers following overexpression of g-csf, we also noted an increase of about  <dig> μm <dig> in the mean cross-sectional area of surviving motoneurons. this suggests a functionally more active, or healthier state of those motoneurons. this has also been noted in adult sod <dig> mice by us previously  <cit> . this finding might point to an additional trophic effect of g-csf in addition to counteracting apoptosis. alternatively, this could signify a proportionally greater anti-apoptotic effect size of g-csf on larger motoneurons which potentially express more receptors on the cell surface.

we have studied motoneuron survival  <dig> days after axotomy with the aim to demonstrate that g-csf can counteract apoptosis in motoneurons in vivo in a simple paradigm as a mean to better dissect mechanisms of action in the more complex als mouse models. we do not know how transient this effect may be, and whether increased survival would still be detectable at  <dig> month after axotomy. all studies with growth factors in axotomy models that have examined varied time points after axotomy found that the number of surviving neurons declined with time to varying degrees in spite of ongoing treatment  <cit> . the "slope" of this decline might give an indication of the relative potency of growth factors in this paradigm . however, there was always a lasting effect observed if growth factors showed protection after shorter observation time points. the purpose of our study was however not to compare relative efficacies of growth factors in this paradigm. we prefer to study questions of relative efficacy and effect stability in disease models closest and of relevance to the human indication targeted, which is als and sod1-mutant mice in our case.

the observation that the g-csf receptor was induced by axotomy parallels findings from other neurological disease models, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or als  <cit> , and underlines the notion that the g-csf system is part of an endogenous protective system for neurons. this is certainly an argument for the use of g-csf as a pharmacological agent that adresses an endogenously pre-specified mechanism. indeed, g-csf is currently under clinical investigation in ischemic stroke  <cit> , and als  <cit> .

we have undertaken this experiment to better dissect mechanisms responsible for the previously demonstrated beneficial function of g-csf in the sod <dig> mouse model for als. we have chosen the axotomy model to clearly answer the question whether g-csf exerts a direct influence on motoneuron apoptosis in vivo. we have demonstrated potent anti-apoptotic properties of this "redefined" neurotrophic factor in vitro either in cortical neurons  <cit> , or in motoneurons  <cit> , and we favoured the anti-apoptotic hypothesis due to the strong effect on motoneuron survival in vivo. however, als is a multifaceted disease, with many factors involved in the pathophysiology  <cit> , and the sod <dig> models reproduce this complexity with discussed involvement of the neuromuscular junction, the immune system, glial cells and others. moreover, g-csf is a pleiotropic factor that for example also impacts on immunocompetence and inflammatory reactions. the data presented here clearly demonstrate a potent effect of g-csf on motoneuron apoptosis in vivo, and support our assumption that anti-apoptosis plays a central role in the observed effects in the sod <dig> transgenic als model.

since g-csf has such a potent protective role in apoptosis mediated by cell-inherent mechanisms as a response to nerve damage the interesting question arises whether the g-csf system might also play a role in developmental death of motoneurons. this has indeed been shown for a number of neurotrophic factors that protect in the axotomy paradigm  <cit> . we do not believe that this is a confounding factor in our case since the expression of the camkii driven tta is switched on during p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> , while the sensitive period for physiological motoneuron death is between e <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> .

although we do not see significant effects on the number of contralateral motoneurons in the different transgenic crosses, there is an interesting trend  towards more motoneurons contralaterally in the g-csf overexpressors compared to littermates not transgenic for the camkii tta driver. one might speculate that a reason for this trend observation could be contralateral effects of axotomy that are counteracted by g-csf. this slight nominal difference on the contralateral side does however not change our result, since the protective effect of g-csf is also highly significant when regarding ipsi-/contralateral ratios instead of ipsilateral cell numbers.

the mechanisms responsible for counteraction of apoptosis elicited by g-csf in neurons have been previously delineated by us: activation of akt in neurons and induction of stat <dig> and bcl-proteins  <cit> . the akt and stat <dig> pathways play a crucial role for the survival of the axotomized motoneurons  <cit> . it is therefore highly likely that g-csf mediates its protective effect via these pathways in the axotomy paradigm as well.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have shown that g-csf counteracts motoneuron death in a model of neonatal axotomy-induced apoptosis. this is most likely mediated by direct actions of the protein on motoneurons in vivo, and suggests that the protection offered by g-csf in als mouse models is due to its direct neuroprotective activity. moreover, our data strengthen the overall evidence that g-csf is a candidate drug for the treatment of als.
