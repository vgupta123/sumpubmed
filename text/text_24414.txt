BACKGROUND
the origin, evolution, function and regulation of hox genes are amongst the most intriguing questions in developmental biology and evolutionary genetics. their highly conserved clustered arrangement on chromosomes, their spatio-temporal expression and their patterning results in each distinctive body plan during embryogenesis and organogenesis in bilaterian animals
 <cit> . hox genes are expressed as early as the pre-somite stage of gastrulation in the posterior primitive streak of the epiblast, a region that gives rise mainly to the lateral plate and extraembryonic mesoderm in chicken and mouse embryos
 <cit> . the dynamic expression of hox genes in the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm during gastrulation suggests that hox genes are key regulators of regional patterning along the antero-posterior  axis
 <cit> . hox genes confer positional information for proper organ development and are expressed in ordered patterns that control the segmentation of the hindbrain and axial skeleton along the a-p axis, while mis-expression or mutation leads to the conversion of one structure into another, 
 <cit> . limb development and regeneration depends on patterning formation along three axes: a-p, dorsal ventral , and proximal distal  axes
 <cit> , where hox a and hox d, especially groups 9– <dig>  are responsible for positional information along the a-p and p-d axes
 <cit> . de-regulation of the hox network results in cancers including breast, bladder, prostate and kidney, as well as abnormal expression during proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and signal transduction
 <cit> .

in all vertebrates, hox genes are comprised of two exons, in which exon  <dig> includes the highly conserved  <dig> bp of homeobox region, and a variable length of intron, from less than  <dig> bp to several kilobase pairs. the homeodomain encoded by a homeobox consists of  <dig> highly conserved amino acids and forms an n-terminal extended structure followed by three alpha helices. the homeodomain binds target dna sequences at its n-terminal arm and the third helix from the minor and major groove of dna, respectively. orthologues of every hox gene, including the homeodomain and flanking regions, are highly conserved among species. however, within species, the most conserved region between paralogues is restricted to the homeodomain. hox genes are clustered on different chromosomes and are believed to have evolved from a single ancestral hox gene by tandem duplications and sequence divergence
 <cit> . there are four hox clusters, denoted a, b, c and d, produced by two successive whole genome duplication events followed by subsequent divergence
 <cit> . paralogues within each cluster are designated  <dig> to  <dig> based on gene 5′-3′ transcribing orientation although there are only  <dig> paralogues at most found so far in vertebrates.

the low density of interspersed repeats in the human hox clusters suggests that cis-regulatory elements are important in the tight control of hox gene expression
 <cit> . global enhancer sequences located outside the clusters regulate hoxd temporal co-linearity
 <cit> . non-coding rnas known to be involved in regulation of hox gene expression
 <cit> , include the highly conserved micrornas
 <cit> , such as mir- <dig> <cit>  and mir- <dig> <cit> . the long non-coding rnas hotair <cit>  and hotairm <dig> <cit>  are known only in the mouse and human.

the comparison of hox genes between vertebrates and invertebrates has highlighted conserved features of hox gene expression regulation and evolution. comparisons of dna sequences between evolutionarily distantly-related genomes are highly efficient ways to identify conserved  functional regions, especially non-coding rnas, and to discover how they regulate hox gene expression
 <cit> . however, some conserved functional features show lineage-specific distributions and will be missed if the taxa chosen are too distant in evolutionary terms. similarly, if they are too close, differences can be missed. marsupials fill the mammalian “gap” because they are a distinct lineage that diverged from eutherian mammals 130– <dig> ma ago
 <cit> , but they are still mammals. there is a high ratio of conservation signal to random noise in comparisons between therian mammal  genomes, suggesting that there are localized regions under evolutionary constraint
 <cit> . the divergence time between these groups is sufficient for non-functional sequences to have diverged while important genes are sufficiently conserved to enable their clear identification. comparative genomics between eutherians and marsupials is therefore invaluable for predicting new and novel mammalian-specific motifs participating in hox gene expression and regulation during mammalian evolution.

in this study, we used the tammar wallaby , a macropodid marsupial of the kangaroo family, as our model. we screened bac clones and further characterized all  <dig> tammar hox genes as well as genome mapping and deep sequencing. comparative genomic analyses identified the known hox coding genes and non-coding regulatory regions including regulatory elements and non-coding rnas. importantly, we uncovered a new potential microrna in the tammar hox cluster.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
to map hox clusters on the tammar chromosomes , partial sequences of  <dig> tammar hox genes were retrieved using the assembled tammar genome 
 <cit>  and the trace archives in genbank. the hox genes and clusters were highly fragmented in the genome assembly, so we used these sequences to screen a bac library  and then utilized a shotgun sequencing approach. five bac clones covering the hoxa to hoxd clusters were pulled down, sequenced using the roche  <dig> platform and de novo assembled . contigs were aligned to the genomic sequences of hox clusters from opossum , platypus  and human . these alignments verified that there were  <dig> hox genes contained in the five bac clones , with hoxa <dig> and hoxd <dig> missing. therefore, cross-species primers were designed to obtain full-length sequences for hoxa <dig> and hoxd <dig>  in addition, to confirm that hoxa <dig> and other hoxa genes were clustered together, we screened a different tammar bac dna library . the newly obtained clones containing hoxa <dig> also included hoxa genes identified by pcr. the same strategy was also used to confirm that hoxd <dig> was clustered with other hoxd genes.

annotation of hox clusters
tammar hox genes were clustered at four different loci with an arrangement of hox <dig> to − <dig> from 5′ to 3′ , showing a similar and highly conserved relative order and orientation of hox genes in each cluster. there are  <dig> hoxa genes in the hoxa cluster,  <dig> hoxb genes in the hoxb cluster,  <dig> hoxc genes in the hoxc cluster and  <dig> hoxd genes in the hoxd cluster, showing a conserved distribution of homologues across each hox cluster. gene sequences have been submitted to genbank with the bac sequences. tammar hox genes each consist of two exons  encoding a highly conserved homeodomain, as is found in other vertebrates, including humans. each hox gene showed a similar and highly conserved overall exon length as well as sequence. although the intron of each hox orthologue varied significantly in sequence, the length of each intron is also conserved , suggesting a high level of conservation across hox clusters during evolution.

the abundance of repetitive dna elements is extremely low in the core of tammar hox clusters, in agreement with the previous findings in gnathostome hox clusters
 <cit> . utilizing repeatmasker , repeat elements including short interspersed repeat elements , long interspersed repeat elements , long terminal repeats  and other dna elements were investigated in each tammar hox cluster . strikingly, there were no alu , ervl , tcmar-tigger and satellite sequences found in any tammar hox locus, resembling the human hox clusters
 <cit> .

tammar hox gene expression in adult tissues
the expression patterns of all  <dig> hox genes were analysed in  <dig> adult tissues by rt-pcr, including brain, gastrointestinal tract, circulatory system, digestive system and reproductive system of the tammar wallaby .

some anterior hox genes  were expressed in the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain in tammar, similar to the expression patterns of human hoxa genes
 <cit> , but very few hox genes were expressed in hypothalamus, pituitary and pancreas. interestingly, almost all hox genes were expressed in cerebellum, suggesting that hox genes continue to participate in coordinating motor activity and communication as they do during development
 <cit> . anterior  and central  hox genes of cluster a/b/d were expressed in the spleen and carry important roles in replenishing red blood cells and in activating the immune response. in the tammar gastrointestinal tract, weak expression was found in intestine while much stronger expression was observed in stomach and caecum, showing tissue-specific expression patterns. anterior and central hox genes of clusters a and b, but not c or d, were expressed in liver and heart. in tammar lung tissue, almost no posterior hox genes were expressed. skeletal muscle had broad expression of hox genes . hox gene expression in reproductive tissues was similar to those in the developing tissues, displaying ongoing proliferation, differentiation, and degeneration of multiple cell types. hox genes were strongly expressed in the mammary gland, kidney, adrenal, testis and ovary, but had a restricted expression in epididymis and uterus. overall, hox genes had tissue-specific expression patterns, maintaining high expression in some tissues, while in other tissues they were down-regulated or switched off.

functional and conserved non-coding sequences in the kangaroo hox clusters
comparative genomic analysis between tammar, human, mouse and a non-mammalian vertebrate, frog  using mvista
 <cit> , showed that the coding regions of each cluster were highly conserved, whereas the non-coding regions including untranslated regions , intergenic regions and introns shared a comparatively low sequence similarity but were conserved in length. furthermore, there was higher conservation in the 3′ utr of each hox gene than in the 5′ utr, similar to previous findings
 <cit>  . this provided a platform to identify whether these conserved non-coding sequences function as conserved transcription factor binding sites or non-coding rnas participating in gene expression regulation/rna processing, or whether they just act as non-functional and randomly conserved elements, maintaining high sequence identity for about  <dig> ma of evolution for vertebrates or up to  <dig> ma of evolution for mammals
 <cit> .

known long non-coding rnas are conserved in the kangaroo hox clusters
long non-coding rnas  play critical roles in transcription regulation, epigenetic gene regulation and diseases. they are rapidly evolving genes, and are expected to be poorly conserved at the sequence level
 <cit> . however, we found conserved orthologues of all three known mammalian lncrnas—hotairm1hoxa11as and hotair —by comparative genomic analysis and rt-pcr amplification.

hox antisense intergenic rna myeloid  <dig>  was located between hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig>  and we demonstrated that it was restricted to mammals . the tammar hotairm <dig> has three exons according to rt-pcr size. exon  <dig> was highly conserved across all mammals. exon  <dig> could not be detected in tammar and opossum using the “infernal”  program , which employs both rna secondary structure and sequence to search the genomic sequence, but using rt-pcr, we were able to find exon  <dig>  the conservation of the secondary structure of exon  <dig> is lower than that of exon <dig>  but is much higher than that of exon  <dig>  which can be clearly observed by the phylogenetic trees in the right bottom panels . hotairm <dig> was expressed in bone marrow as expected , suggesting that this lncrna has had conserved roles in myelopoiesis across all mammals for up to  <dig> ma.

tammar hoxa <dig> antisense , located between hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig>  has two exons similar to that in human . hoxa11as was highly conserved in eutherian mammals, but had a very low conservation in marsupial species, while in the frog it had less than 50% identity. additionally, using the “infernal” program we found that exon  <dig> had a conserved rna secondary structure, but it failed to predict exon  <dig>  although there was a low conservation between tammar and eutherian mammals, tammar hoxa11as was expressed in the endometrium during pregnancy  as it is in humans, suggesting a conserved role in mammalian reproduction.

hox antisense intergenic rna  is a trans-regulatory gene, unlike the other lncrnas that are cis-regulatory. it plays an important role in epigenetics and tumorigenesis. in the tammar, it was located between hoxc <dig> and hoxc <dig> as in human and mouse. exon 1– <dig> are very short exons of about  <dig> bp, and exon  <dig> is just  <dig> bp in human, but there was only low conservation seen in the mvista plot . exon  <dig> is the longest exon, showing some regions that are highly conserved . in the tammar, exon 1– <dig> could not be identified with the “infernal” program using human rna secondary structure of each exon to search the tammar hox genomic sequence. however, exon  <dig> is highly conserved in all species and was easily identified using rna secondary structure or sequence itself. the phylogenetic tree further confirmed this phenomenon, showing it had a much short genetic distance compared to the other exons . although tammar exon  <dig> was identified using the “infernal” program, it showed very low sequence conservation  and a long branch length in the phylogenetic tree . tammar exon  <dig> was much shorter than that of other species. exon  <dig> was highly conserved in eutherian mammals  but the short tammar sequence was conserved with the equivalent sequence in eutherians. tammar hotair was present in a rt-pcr of a whole day  <dig> fetus at the early head-fold stage  and was also expressed in the developing limbs at least at day  <dig> of gestation
 <cit>  as in the human and mouse
 <cit> , suggesting that this lncrna may be involved in trans-regulation of limb development in all mammals
 <cit> .

the kangaroo hox clusters encode conserved micrornas
mvista plots showed numerous non-coding regions, possibly representing micrornas, were highly conserved . we examined the presence of known micrornas, mir-196a <dig>  mir-196a <dig>  mir-196b, mir-10a and mir-10b, previously described in the human, mouse and zebrafish hox clusters. as expected, we found  <dig> known conserved mirnas in tammar hox clusters . we examined tammar microrna deep sequencing libraries from different tissues and cells to determine the expression profile of each of these mirnas. we found that mir-10a and mir-10b were strongly expressed in the testis. they are also expressed in fibroblast cells of the tammar.

in order to computationally explore new or novel mirnas and their targets in the hox cluster of the tammar wallaby, we developed special mirna pipeline for tammar wallaby and programs  by using our microrna deep sequencing libraries, hox cluster sequence obtained by our bac sequencing, tammar whole genome sequence and mirbase . interestingly, we found one new potentially functional mirna with a distinct hairpin structure that is expressed in fibroblasts and testis . regarding targets of mirnas in the tammar hox clusters, valid mirna hits to mir-10a, mir-10b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were confirmed . unfortunately, we could not find the target of our newly discovered candidate microrna in hox cluster. however, we found several new targets in hox clusters that are novel putative micrornas with hairpin structures but their exact location in the tammar genome could not yet be determined .

discussion
comparative genomic analysis of the marsupial hox clusters uncovered a new microrna and confirmed the presence of numerous known mammalian rnas. there was a strikingly high level of conservation of coding sequences between this member of the kangaroo family and that of eutherian mammals.

marsupial hox gene clusters are compact and uninterrupted by large repeat domains. in the tammar, the length of all clusters were remarkably similar to that found in human . similar patterns are also found in frog, chicken and mouse , demonstrating that the hox gene clusters are highly conserved and compact across vertebrate lineages. however, amphioxus, which is viewed as an “archetypal” genus in the chordate lineage, carries a hox cluster length of about  <dig> kb
 <cit> . in invertebrates, hox clusters are often more than  <dig> mb, as is found in the sea urchin
 <cit> . thus the vertebrate hox clusters are more compact than the ancient and invertebrate hox clusters
 <cit> .

all  <dig> tammar hox genes had conserved gene structures  and chromosomal arrangement , consistent with the theory that two rounds of genome duplications occurred after the vertebrate–invertebrate divergence but before bony fishes and tetrapods split
 <cit> . in adults, hox genes continue to be expressed and thereby retain developmental plasticity in certain tissues or maintain homeostasis. however, there has been much less work on gene expression in adult tissues compared to developing tissues
 <cit> . we showed that hox gene expression in adult marsupial tissues was tissue-specific and differentially expressed . interestingly, almost all hox genes were expressed in the cerebellum, suggesting that hox genes continue to participate in coordinating motor activity and communication in adults, as they do during development
 <cit> .

using the tammar hox genomic sequences as a reference for phylogenetic footprinting, we were able to identify a large number of conserved non-coding genomic sequences which may act as transcription factor binding sites in promoters, regulatory motifs involved in chromatin remodeling or non-coding rnas that modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally
 <cit> . long non-coding rnas play diverse roles in biological processes but are thought to be under different evolutionary constraints and are expected to have low sequence conservation compared to protein-coding sequences
 <cit> , which has hampered the study of long non-coding rna in vertebrates. we not only found these lncrnas orthologues in the tammar hox genome, but also confirmed that they were expressed in certain tissues. for example, human hotairm <dig> is expressed specifically in myeloid cells to regulate hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig> expression in nb <dig> cells 
 <cit> . tammar hotairm <dig> was also expressed in bone marrow, suggesting it has a conserved role in myelopoiesis across all mammals. in addition, hotairm <dig> appears to be restricted to mammals and so must have evolved during the mammalian radiation. a recently discovered long non-coding rna, hotair <cit> , acts as a trans-regulator to regulate hoxd but not hoxc gene expression during limb development
 <cit>  and participates in reprogramming chromatin states to promote cancer metastasis
 <cit> . tammar hotair was also found in the tammar hox genomic sequence
 <cit> , and was expressed at the early head-fold stage of the tammar embryo at the time just before limb buds develop, suggesting that it may have a role in the regulation of limb development—especially important structures for the kangaroos
 <cit> . in addition, the 5′ flanking sequence of hotair was conserved, suggesting that it has the same or similar transcriptional regulation mechanism . thus, contrary to expectation, mammalian lncrnas do show a reasonable level of sequence conservation.

micro-rnas are highly conserved, in contrast to long non-coding rnas, and play important roles in animal development by controlling translation or stability of mrnas
 <cit> . they are normally  <dig> nucleotide rna that binds to complementary sequences in the 3′utr to repress gene activities
 <cit> . using the tammar as a reference and searching the microrna database we were able to identify four known hox micrornas , and most significantly, we uncovered one new potential microrna, meu-mir- <dig> in the tammar which was expressed in testis and fibroblasts. the precursor sequence was used to search the human, mouse, and frog genomes and was not present . we also searched the opossum and tasmanian devil genome sequences using the precursor sequence plus of  <dig> kb flanking sequences. while the flanking sequences were conserved in these two other marsupial species, we did not find the sequence immediately around the precursor, suggesting that it is a recent insertion in tammar. in silico analysis as well in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that the mirnas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> target several hox genes, such as hoxa5/7/ <dig>  hoxb1/6/7/ <dig>  hoxc <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxa1/3/ <dig>  hoxb <dig> and hoxd10
 <cit> . in this study, we also predicted targets of mirnas, and found the targets of mir-10amir-10bmir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the hox clusters . we also found numerous new targets whose micrornas precursor genes were located outside the hox clusters in the tammar genome . these novel micrornas have a typical secondary hairpin structure and targets in the hox clusters. these mirnas may participate in hox gene expression and regulation to control the kangaroo type body plan and hopping mode of locomotion. thus, using the tammar hox as the reference genome, the examination of the marsupial hox gene clusters has uncovered new and known non-coding rnas of mammals.

CONCLUSIONS
annotation and comparative genomic analysis of tammar hox genes demonstrated a high degree of evolutionary conservation. as expected,  <dig> hox marsupial genes were mapped to four different chromosomal loci. the tammar hox clusters had a low concentration of repetitive elements and were compact as in other vertebrate hox clusters. the protein-coding regions and their utrs also showed high conservation but there was a novel potentially functional mirna meu-mir- <dig> within a hox cluster. interestingly, the long-coding rnas  and micrornas  were highly conserved in this marsupial. these lncrnas and mirnas may control the hox genes to influence phenotypic differences in the body plan, as they do in other mammals. this study confirms that the emergence of known long non-coding rnas in the hox clusters clearly predates the marsupial-eutherian divergence up to  <dig> ma ago.
