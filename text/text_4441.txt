BACKGROUND
mutations in the x-linked mid <dig> gene cause opitz g/bbb syndrome . os is a congenital malformation syndrome characterized by defective ventral midline development with the main features being ocular hypertelorism and hypospadias. additional abnormalities such as cleft lip and palate, laryngo-tracheal fistulas, heart defects, imperforate anus and mental retardation may also be present.

recently we found that the mid <dig> protein associates with microtubules  <cit>  and triggers ubiquitination and degradation of the microtubule-associated protein phosphatase 2a  upon interaction with the α <dig> protein  <cit> . mid <dig> loss-of-function mutations, as seen in os patients, thus cause accumulation of microtubule-associated pp2a and hypophosphorylation of its target proteins.

the mid <dig> mrna is subject to extensive alternative splicing  <cit> . also, several 5'-untranslated regions have been identified and the use of five alternative promoters results in the production of additional mid <dig> transcript isoforms  <cit> .

the expression pattern of mid <dig> has been investigated by northern blot analyses and in situ hybridization  <cit> . in humans, three transcripts of ~ <dig> kb, ~ <dig>  kb and ~ <dig>  kb were observed in all fetal and adult tissues analyzed  <cit> . remarkably, the coding sequence of mid <dig> accounts for only ~ <dig> kb, and the size differences between the known mid <dig> sequence and the transcripts cannot be explained by alternative splicing of either the coding region or 5'utr. however, splicing and/or alternative polyadenylation of the 3'utr have not been investigated so far.

the 3'utrs of many genes have been shown to be involved in pleiotropic regulatory functions, such as rna localization, mrna degradation and stabilization, and translational control. in the present work we describe the identification of several alternative polyadenylation sites in the human mid <dig> 3'utrs which give rise to transcripts with four different 3'utrs and tissue-specific expression patterns.

to identify putative regulatory structures we have characterized the mid <dig> 3'utr with bioinformatic tools and report the presence of putative target sites for rna binding proteins. notably, we identified several au-rich elements  and cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements . as proteins binding to both ares and cpes are known to be key regulators of mrna stability and/or translation, our results suggest a tight control of mid <dig> expression through the different 3'utrs. intriguingly, we also found that specific polyadenylation signals are arrayed with distinct 5'utrs and promoters of the mid <dig> gene, indicating that polyadenylation is a promoter-driven process.

RESULTS
est data indicate alternative polyadenylation of the mid <dig> gene
previous northern blot analyses of human polya+ rna showed mid <dig> transcripts of ~ <dig> kb, ~ <dig>  kb and ~ <dig>  kb  <cit> . as these size differences cannot be explained by alternative splicing of the coding sequence or the 5'utr, we hypothesized the existence of alternative polyadenylation sites  sites) in the 3'utr. to test this hypothesis we analyzed human est data overlapping the mid <dig> 3'utr. a review of the human est database indicated at least three alternative poly sites , which we named esta, b and c. whereas esta and c contain consensus polyadenylation signals at their 3'ends and therefore seem to terminate at real polyadenylation sites, estb does not contain such a signal. a stretch of oligo-a present at the 3'end of estb pointed to putative mis-priming of polyt-primers as a likely cause of this artifactual polyadenylation site . while  <dig> ests overlap estc, only  <dig> ests correspond to esta ; this likely reflects preferential use of the polyadenylation site corresponding to estc.

alternative polyadenylation of the mid <dig> gene in different species
to confirm alternative polyadenylation experimentally we performed 3'race with cdna derived from human fibroblasts . fibroblasts were chosen for this analysis because they express mid <dig> at a moderate level. interestingly, sequencing of the pcr products revealed four different polyadenylation sites which we named pas1– <dig> . two of them match the est data: pas <dig> corresponded to esta and pas <dig> to estc; however, no est data were available for pas <dig> and pas <dig> .

polyadenylation signals consisting of an upstream element  and a downstream u-rich or gu-rich element are in close proximity to all four poly sites , and sequence comparison showed that all four upstream elements are conserved between human and dog. in contrast only some of the human upstream elements are conserved in other species. whereas the element upstream of pas <dig> is conserved between human, opossum and chicken, the element upstream of pas <dig> is conserved between human and rat . to test experimentally whether the mid <dig> mrna is alternatively polyadenylated in other species we performed 3'race on cdna from rat brain, a tissue known to express high levels of mid <dig> . sequencing of the pcr products revealed three alternative polyadenylation sites, rpas1– <dig>  with rpas <dig> corresponding to pas <dig> of the human mid <dig> gene, and rpas <dig> and rpas <dig> probably representing species-specific sites.

3'utr  <dig> directs expression of tissue specific transcripts
to test for expression of the human transcript terminated by pas <dig>  we hybridized a specific riboprobe  against commercially available northern blots containing human polya+ rna extracted from a variety of fetal and adult tissues. in contrast to the picture obtained with a probe detecting the mid <dig> open reading frame, which showed ubiquitous expression of a ~ <dig> kb transcript , a transcript of similar size could only be observed in fetal liver and skeletal muscle with nbpas <dig> . additionally, a variety of shorter and longer transcripts were detected in heart, skeletal muscle, liver and fetal liver. among them a ~ <dig> kb transcript was identified in both adult and fetal liver, making it solely a liver-specific transcript . to further characterize these transcripts we performed 5'race experiments on cdna derived from human fetal liver with a gene-specific primer located downstream of pas <dig> . interestingly, sequencing of the pcr products revealed three unspliced transcripts of different lengths with transcription start sites located in the 3'utr region upstream of pas <dig> .


               mid <dig> transcripts starting from alternative 5'utrs end at specific polyadenylation sites
previous northern blot analyses showed mid <dig> transcripts of ~ <dig> kb, ~ <dig>  b and ~ <dig>  kb  <cit> , thus indicating that all alternative polyadenylation signals are connected to the full-length coding sequence. however, as human mid <dig> has five alternative promoters and 5'utrs  <cit> , we tested for preferential and regulated choice of polyadenylation signals in transcripts starting from alternative promoters. rt-pcr experiments were performed using rna derived from human fibroblasts with primers connecting alternative 5'utr exons 1a, 1c and 1e to regions upstream of pas <dig> , pas <dig>  and pas <dig>  . of note, primer set  <dig> amplified transcripts with poly tails at pas1– <dig> whereas primer set  <dig> amplified transcripts with poly tails at pas2– <dig> and primer set  <dig> exclusively amplified transcripts with poly tails at pas3– <dig>  for sequencing, pcr products were excised from the gel and cloned into the pgem-t easy vector.

concerning exon 1c, products were amplified with each of the different 3'utr primer sets . in view of the tissue-restricted expression of pas <dig>  this result clearly shows that transcripts starting in exon 1c are polyadenylated at pas <dig> and thus correspond to the  <dig> kb transcript seen on northern blots. however, it remains unclear whether there actually are transcripts that start in exon 1c and terminate at pas <dig> or pas <dig>  sequencing of the cloned pcr products revealed the constitutive mid <dig> coding sequence to be present in five out of six clones . one clone represented an in-frame splice variant containing the short variant of exon  <dig>  alternatively spliced exon 2d and constitutive exons 2– <dig>  <cit>  . because of the comparable sizes of the two transcripts, the rt-pcr products of the alternative splice variant and the constitutive transcript could not be separated on the agarose gel.

rt-pcr with primers located in exv1a amplified products only in combination with reverse primers located upstream of pas <dig>  indicating preferential polyadenylation at pas <dig> in transcripts derived from promoter 1a . however, as the primers located upstream of pas <dig> showed inconsistent results in other experiments , we cannot exclude the use of pas <dig> with exv1a. again, sequencing of three clones confirmed the specificity of the rt-pcr reaction and revealed the presence of the constitutive coding sequence in two of them and the presence of an alternative splice variant containing the short variant of exon  <dig> in the third .

the use of forward primers located in exon 1e led to inconsistent results. in two out of three independent experiments we obtained products when using reverse primers located upstream of pas <dig>  while we were not able to clone these products, the transcript sizes indicated the presence of the entire 3'utr sequence in those transcripts. however, when we used reverse primers located upstream of pas <dig>  no products were obtained in any of the experiments. rt-pcr with reverse primers located upstream of pas <dig> amplified transcripts in every experiment . characterization of these transcripts revealed the presence of the constitutive coding sequence in five out of six sequenced clones and a splice variant containing the short variant of exon  <dig> in the sixth .

our rt-pcr experiments indicate preferential and regulated choice of polyadenylation signals for transcripts starting from each single mid <dig> promoter. to test whether this phenomenon is a characteristic of fibroblasts or a general regulatory mechanism of mid <dig> expression we performed rt-pcr experiments using rna derived from two additional human tissues, namely testis and fetal brain . again, we obtained products with each of the different 3'utr primer sets when forward primers were located in exon 1c  and only obtained products from fetal brain with primer set  <dig> when forward primers were located in exv1a . when we used rna from testis we couldn't obtain any products with primers located in exv1a indicating that exv1a is not expressed in this tissue. with exon 1e primers products were amplified only with primer sets  <dig> and  <dig> indicating termination at pas <dig> in these tissues.

sequencing of the two cloned products revealed the constitutive mid <dig> coding sequence when primers where located in exv1a or exon 1e. concerning exon 1c we additionally obtained two alternative splice variants . one short variant, which was present in both tissues, testis and fetal brain , contained constitutive exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the second splice variant lacked part of the 3'utr but contained the whole constitutive coding region.

in confirmation of the rt-pcr experiments, probes specifically detecting exon 1c or exon 1e were hybridized against commercially available northern blots containing polya+ rna extracted from a variety of human fetal tissues . a ~ <dig> kb and a weaker ~ <dig>  kb transcript were detected in all fetal tissues analyzed using a probe hybridizing to exon 1c  confirming termination of exon 1c transcripts at pas <dig>  and pas <dig>  in contrast, a probe hybridizing to exon 1e detected a ~ <dig>  kb transcript but not a ~ <dig> kb transcript . this hybridization pattern indicated that the  <dig> kb transcript, which would use the pas <dig> polyadenylation signal, is a rare mrna when transcription is initiated by use of promoter e. however, while expression of the ~ <dig>  kb transcript was high in fetal kidney, weak expression of the same transcript could be detected in the other fetal tissues by autoradiography prior to the final washing of the membrane . also we observed expression of smaller transcripts of ~ <dig>  kb in fetal lung and ~ <dig>  kb in fetal liver, suggesting that promoter e drives expression of smaller splice variants in addition to the expression of the constitutive mid <dig> coding sequence . however, because hybridization was carried out with a double-stranded dna-probe, these smaller transcripts might also be overlapping antisense transcripts. remarkably, in contrast to our rt-pcr experiments we could not detect any transcripts in fetal brain, which indicates their low expression. by direct comparison of the two northern blots  the two main transcripts of each promoter variant  both appear to be highly expressed in fetal kidney while expression levels of these transcripts and those of smaller sizes appear to vary in all other tissues.

the mid <dig> 3'utr contains highly conserved regulatory motifs, which are bound by interacting proteins
in order to screen for functionally relevant sequences within the 3'utr of mid <dig>  evolutionary conservation between human, rat and dog mid <dig> 3'utrs was analyzed. while the overall sequence identity  is 76% between human and rat and 80% between human and dog, some blocks of stronger sequence similarity are present – the strongest starting  <dig>  bp 3' of the translational stop codon, spanning  <dig> bp, and having a sequence similarity of 88% between human and rat. parts of the 3'utr are conserved even between human/rat and more distantly related species like xenopus tropicalis and tetraodon , indicating that the mid <dig> 3'utr is under strong selective pressure.

conservation of the sequence of the mid <dig> 3'utr suggests the presence of regulatory motifs, such as for the binding of proteins. bioinformatic analysis indeed identified several putative protein-binding motifs. in addition to motifs like cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements with the consensus sequence ttttat  <cit>  and additional polyadenylation signals, we found au-rich elements  with the sequence attta in all parts of the 3'utr . some of these short are motifs were found to be parts of much longer au-rich sequences which may indicate their functional relevance  <cit>  . ares have been shown to influence rna stability and/or to control translation of a number of genes  <cit> .

particularly are <dig> seemed to be of potential functional relevance because it comprises a long au-rich sequence, which is highly conserved in various species . to test for binding of interacting proteins to this motif a radioactively labelled transcript corresponding to are <dig> was incubated with hela cell lysate and subsequent uv-crosslinking was performed. complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through sds acrylamide gels and dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. interestingly, this method identified several proteins of ~ <dig> and 30– <dig> kd that had bound the sense are <dig> transcript but not the antisense control . in a next step we tried to identify proteins which interact with the are <dig> motif. as candidates we considered the are-binding proteins hur and auf <dig> because they have sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> kd which correspond to those of the proteins seen in the uv-assay. to test for binding of the candidate proteins we performed a rna-protein pulldown assay by incubating a biotin labelled transcript corresponding to are <dig> with hela cell lysate. rna-protein complexes were subsequently pulled down with streptavidin magnetic beads. complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through sds acrylamide gels. western blot analyses with specific antibodies directed against auf <dig> and hur showed a clear binding of both proteins to the are <dig> sense rna, while only little auf <dig> protein and almost no hur had bound to the are <dig> antisense rna .

discussion
alternative polyadenylation is a widespread mechanism of gene regulation in mammals and is often associated with specific tissue/cell types and/or developmental stages  <cit> . previous northern blot analyses of human fetal and adult tissues identified mid <dig> transcripts of ~ <dig> kb, ~ <dig>  kb and ~ <dig>  kb  <cit> . here we show that tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation in the mid <dig> gene underlies the observed size differences. interestingly, usage of the identified polyadenylation sites appears to be determined by the choice of alternative promoters, which themselves contribute to differential mid <dig> expression  <cit> . in a bioinformatic approach we further found numerous putative rna-protein interaction motifs in the mid <dig> 3'utrs, several of which turned out to be conserved between human and other species.

we found that the human mid <dig> 3'utr contains four polyadenylation sites, pas1–pas <dig>  polyadenylation at pas <dig> results in a  <dig>  kb transcript and usage of pas <dig> leads to a  <dig>  kb transcript. due to a size difference of only  <dig> bp, mrnas polyadenylated at pas <dig> and pas <dig> appear as a single ~ <dig> kb band on northern blots.

in order to differentiate between the transcripts using either pas <dig> or pas <dig> we hybridized a riboprobe exclusively detecting the fourth part of the 3'utr against commercially available northern blots. in contrast to ubiquitous expression of the  <dig> kb transcript detected with a probe corresponding to the mid <dig> open reading frame , we saw expression of the pas <dig>  <dig> kb transcript to be restricted to skeletal muscle and fetal liver. hence, these experiments prove tissue restriction of the pas <dig> transcripts and ubiquitous expression of the pas <dig> transcripts and indicate that pas <dig> is the constitutive polyadenylation signal. remarkably, besides the ~ <dig> kb transcript, shorter variants of ~ <dig> kb, ~ <dig>  kb and ~ <dig> bp could be observed when using the pas <dig> specific riboprobe. the use of a single stranded riboprobe for northern blot analyses excluded the possibility that these transcripts are overlapping antisense transcripts. 5'race showed that these transcripts are unspliced and have transcription starts which are located in the 3'utr. several points indicate that these are full-length transcripts. first, the overall sizes of transcripts  <dig> and  <dig> approximately match the sizes of the  <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb northern bands detected in the lane loaded with rna from fetal liver . an additional smaller  <dig>  kb transcript amplified by 5'race did not show up on the northern blot which might be due to its low expression . secondly, all three transcripts contain a distinct sequence motif which is found exclusively in transcription start sites derived from 3'utrs  <cit> , namely a triple g at the - <dig> to - <dig> position. in addition to the triple g, carninci et al.  <cit>  mentioned a highly conserved region located  <dig> to  <dig> bases downstream of 3'utr transcription start sites. concerning the mid <dig> transcripts, conservation of the + <dig> to + <dig> region is not higher than that of the remaining 3'utr. as pas <dig> is poorly conserved in other species this polyadenylation site might be human specific and therefore a high conservation of the + <dig> to + <dig> region might not be expected. although the functions of transcripts with transcription starts in 3'utrs are unclear it has been suggested that they might regulate downstream genes which are encoded on the opposite strand using a sense-antisense mechanism  <cit> . the next neighbouring gene, the clcn <dig> gene, is located at a distance of ~ <dig> kb downstream of mid <dig>  as this gene is encoded on the opposite strand compared to mid <dig> such a sense-antisense regulation seems possible. on the other hand the three identified transcripts might encode short proteins. however, inspection of the sequence of transcript  <dig> which also contains the sequences of transcripts  <dig> and  <dig> revealed the longest protein sequence to be  <dig> amino acids with no conserved domains.

tian et al. estimated that ~54% of all human genes and ~32% of all mouse genes use alternative polyadenylation sites  <cit> . many human polyadenylation signals used are conserved in their rodent orthologs. interestingly, concerning the mid <dig> polyadenylation signals, only the signal directing cleavage of pas <dig> is conserved in the rat, again indicating that pas <dig> is the constitutive polyadenylation site whereas pas <dig>  pas <dig> and pas <dig> can be used alternatively. this is further supported by the fact that the  <dig> kb transcript, which derives from transcripts using pas <dig>  is more strongly expressed than the  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb transcripts. moreover, pas <dig> is represented by multiple ests in the database that are derived from a variety of fetal and adult tissues . no ests were found representing transcripts using pas <dig> and pas <dig> and only a few ests are present to indicate usage of pas <dig> 

ests for pas <dig> are mainly derived from stomach, suggesting tissue-specific usage of pas <dig> 

however, a definitive statement about relative expression levels of the alternatively polyadenylated mid <dig> transcripts cannot be made at this point which is due to the following reasons: first comparison of differently sized transcripts that are detected through northern blot analyses is limited because the signal intensity is influenced by the sizes of the respective transcripts. second the sequences of the alternatively polyadenylated mid <dig> transcripts are partially overlapping, and thus cannot be amplified individually by rt-pcr experiments.

interestingly, we show that promoter usage is linked to poly site selection in the mid <dig> gene . this phenomenon cannot be explained solely by expression of tissue-specific polyadenylation factors although the relative levels of expression of polyadenylation factors and transcription factors might influence the poly site selection in a given cell-type  <cit> . splicing factors that have a role in 3'end formation, as suggested recently  <cit>  could contribute here. also, chromatin-remodelling enzymes that can have both positive and negative roles in promoter regulation, elongation and termination could be involved  <cit> . in line with that hypothesis it has been suggested that predefined chromatin transcription units exist in yeast before transcription commences  <cit> . furthermore, specific transcription factors that bind to both the promoter and poly signal could play a role, which is supported by the observation that an increasing number of factors are essential for transcription and transcript termination  <cit> . it seems possible that all these mechanisms act together and build up a complex regulatory network that controls poly site selection in order to ensure a tight control of gene expression. in the future the well characterized mid <dig> transcripts will be a suitable model for further investigation of this plausible hypothesis.

5'utrs and 3'utrs are implicated in the regulation of many aspects of mrna function. 5'utrs may contain upstream open reading frames which inhibit translation by restricting the access of ribosomes to the correct start codon  <cit> . several upstream aug codons are present in the different mid <dig> 5'utr exons and hence, it was suggested that differentially transcribed mid <dig> isoforms are translated at different levels  <cit> . moreover, both 5'utrs and 3'utrs can contain specific sites to which regulatory rnas or proteins bind. the composition of these sites ranges from short primary sequence elements to specific secondary structures  <cit> . sequence analyses of the mid <dig> 3'utr revealed the existence of several cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements . cytoplasmic polyadenylation is a key mechanism affecting genes that are involved in synaptic plasticity and controlling mrna translation during early development  <cit> . it is regulated by two cis-acting sequences, the cpe and the upstream element aauaaa. although it has been suggested that cpes are usually located within 20– <dig> nucleotides upstream of the aauaaa element, examples of mrnas with much longer cpe-to-aauaaa distances have been described, e.g. the cpe of c <dig>  which resides  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the hexamer  <cit> . of note, four of the six cpes found in the mid <dig> 3'utr are conserved in other species . besides cpes, the mid <dig> 3'utr contains multiple au-rich elements  of the sequence attta, several of which are conserved in other species . like functionally relevant ares of other genes  <cit> , four of the conserved pentamers of the mid <dig> 3'utr are embedded in much longer au-rich sequences . ares are well described sequence elements to which a range of different proteins can bind, e.g. auf <dig>  hur and ksrp  <cit> . these proteins can influence stability and/or translation of the respective mrnas. in a uv-crosslink assay we could identify several proteins that bind to the are <dig> motif of the human mid <dig> 3'utr. as the sizes of the identified proteins fit quite well with the sizes of several known are-binding proteins, such as hur and auf <dig>  they were good candidates for regulating mid <dig> expression. in an rna-protein pulldown assay we could indeed confirm binding of these proteins to the are <dig> motif of the mid <dig> 3'utr.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that mature mrnas of the mid <dig> gene end at four different polyadenylation sites. the different 3'utrs of the mid <dig> gene contain several evolutionary conserved sequence motifs, which suggests a contribution of the 3'utrs to the mrna stability and translation of the gene. in addition, we found that expression of the mid <dig> gene is differentially regulated by the concerted action of alternative promoters and alternative polyadenylation signals both during embryonic development and in the adult.
