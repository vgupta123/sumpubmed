BACKGROUND
micrornas  are non-coding rnas about 21â€“ <dig> nucleotide  in length that can play important roles in gene regulation by targeting mrnas for cleavage or translational repression  <cit> . according to the current understanding, mirna is transcribed as long primary mirna, which is processed into 60~ <dig> nt mirna precursor  by nuclear rnase iii drosha  <cit> . the pre-mirna is transported from nuclear to cytoplasm by exportin- <dig>  <cit>  and then cleaved into ~ <dig> nt duplexes  <cit> . almost all pre-mirnas have the characteristic of stem-loop hairpin structures. during the biogenesis procedure of a mature mirna, the hairpin structure of pre-mirna acts as not only the structure motif for exportin- <dig> in nuclear-cytoplasm transportation, but also a substrate for dicer enzyme  <cit> . this indicates the importance of the secondary structures in the mirna biogenesis procedure.

due to the difficulty of systematically detecting mirnas from a genome by existing experiment techniques, computational methods play important roles in the identification of new mirnas. as a characteristic secondary structure, the hairpin of pre-mirna is an important feature used in the computational identification of mirnas. for examples, mirscan relies on the observation that the known mirnas are derived from phylogenetically conserved stem-loop precursor rnas with characteristic features  <cit> . it successfully predicted hundreds of mirnas in nematodes and human with a sensitivity of  <dig> . the mirseeker  <cit>  was developed for predicting mirna genes in insects, whereas mircheck  <cit>  and mirfinder  <cit>  were applied in plants. recently, the miralign  <cit>  aligns the secondary structure of pre-mirnas to detect mirnas. however, there can be many sequence segments in a genome that may fold into the similar stem-loop hairpin structures, e.g., about ~ <dig> million hairpins can be folded in the human genome  <cit> , and some  <dig>  hairpin candidates can be obtained in c. elegans, corresponding to ~4% of the worm genome  <cit> . therefore, all those existing methods utilize comparative genomics information besides structure features to predict new mirnas. a typical idea is to use comparative genomics to filter most of hairpins that are not conserved in related species. such filtering steps make the methods unable to identify new mirnas for which there are no known close homologies either due to the limitation of current data or due to the possibly rapid evolution of mirnas. a latest report shows that the number of non-conserved mirnas which are missed by the comparative genomics strategy is still large  <cit> . furthermore, for a species that does not have a closely related species sequenced, its mirnas cannot be studied with comparative genomics approaches either.

in this study, we focus on the ab initio classification of real pre-mirna from other hairpin sequences with similar stem-loop features . a set of novel features that combines the local continuous structure and sequence information of the stem-loops are proposed. the machine learning method svm or support vector machine is used to classify two classes based on the features. svm has been widely applied to the prediction and classification of important biology signals such as promoters  <cit> , translation initiation sites  <cit> , splicing sites  <cit>  and proteins  <cit> . recently, svm was successfully applied to predict new virus mirnas  <cit>  and functional sirnas  <cit> . with the local structure-sequence features we extracted, svm achieves the accuracy about 90% for distinguishing real vs. pseudo human pre-mirnas. interestingly, the svm classifier trained on human mirna data can also identify mirnas of other species across animals, plants and virus with high accuracy, which indicates that the features may reflect a characteristic that is consistent across all species. the classifier is also validated on the latest human mirna data which were missed by all existing prediction methods  <cit>  and a high accuracy  is achieved.

RESULTS
human mirna precursor and pseudo mirna datasets
sets of human pre-mirnas and pseudo-mirna hairpins are collected to train svms and to evaluate the classification performance.

human mirna precursors
the sequences of human pre-mirnas are downloaded from the mirna registry database  <cit>  in sept.,  <dig> , which contains  <dig> reported pre-mirna entries from homo sapiens. only the pre-mirnas whose secondary structures do not contain multiple loops are considered, which gives us  <dig> pre-mirnas, covering more than 93% of all the reported human pre-mirnas.

pseudo and candidate mirna hairpins
two datasets of pre-mirna-like hairpins are built. they are sequence segments that have similar stem-loop structures as genuine pre-mirnas but have not been reported as pre-mirnas. for the convenience of discussion, we call them as the "coding" and the "conserved-hairpin" datasets according to the ways we collect them.

the coding dataset is collected from the protein coding regions. the protein coding sequences  of human refseq genes with no known alternative splice events are collected. the cds sequences are extracted according to the ucsc refgene annotation tables  <cit> . we join the cds sequences together and extract non-overlapping segments from it, keeping the length distribution of the extracted segments identical with that of human pre-mirnas. the secondary structures of the extracted segments are predicted using rnafold  <cit> . the criteria for selecting the pseudo-mirnas from the segments are: minimum of  <dig> base pairings on the stem of the hairpin structure , maximum of - <dig> kcal/mol free energy of the secondary structure, and no multiple loops. these criteria ensure that the extracted pseudo pre-mirnas are similar to real pre-mirnas according to the widely accepted characteristics.  as all reported mirnas are located in the un-translated regions or intergenic regions, we take the hairpins collected from cds as examples of pseudo pre-mirnas. totally,  <dig>  pre-mirna-like hairpins are collected in this dataset.

the conserved-hairpin dataset is extracted from the genome region of position  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> on human chromosome  <dig>  the data are obtained from the ucsc database   <cit> . the  <dig> sequences conserved between human and mouse in this region are collected, which contain  <dig>  nucleotides. we use a window of width  <dig> nt to scan the region with step length  <dig> nt to produce sequence segments, the secondary structures of which are then predicted by rnafold  <cit> . this results in  <dig>  hairpins to compose the conserved-hairpin dataset according to the same criteria used for the coding dataset. it should be noted that, unlike the coding set, there might be a few true mirnas among these segments. but since mirnas only takes a very small proportion in the genome, most of the hairpins in this dataset are more likely pseudo-mirnas. in fact, there are  <dig> known mirnas  in this dataset.

the coding dataset is used as negative samples in the training and validation of the svm classifier, and the conserved-hairpin dataset is used as a candidate dataset to evaluate how the classifier works on the genome.

training and test sets for classification experiments
for the classification experiments, one training set and two test sets are built using the datasets described above. the training set tr-c includes  <dig> human pre-mirnas  and  <dig> pseudo pre-mirnas  randomly selected from the  <dig> human pre-mirnas and the coding dataset, respectively. the test set te-c comprises of the remaining  <dig> human pre-mirnas not used in tr-c and  <dig> pseudo pre-mirnas randomly picked up from the coding dataset . the conserved-hairpin dataset is the second test set.

cross-species test set
after experimenting on the human data, we apply the svm classifier trained with human data to other species to see if the features are conserved during evolution. the release  <dig>  of the mirna registry  <cit>  contains  <dig> pre-mirnas entries from  <dig> species besides human: caenorhabditis elegans, caenorhabditis briggsae, drosophila melanogaster, drosophila pseudoobscura, dnio rerio, gallus gallus, mus musculusi, rattus norvegicus, arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa and epstein barr virus. only the pre-mirnas with no multiple loops are used, which cover more than 90% of all the reported pre-mirnas of the  <dig> species. the pre-mirnas that share high sequence similarities with the human pre-mirnas are excluded to avoid biased evaluation of the svm trained on human data. the similarity is calculated using blastclust  <cit>  with s =  <dig>  l =  <dig> , w =  <dig>  with these processing,  <dig> pre-mirnas from the  <dig> species remained for the test experiment. we refer this set of pre-mirnas as the cross-species test set.

latest human mirna updated set
at the time this paper was being written, a batch of new human mirnas are reported, most of which are not conserved beyond primates  <cit> . we took these latest data as an independent test set and applied our svm classifier on it. from the  <dig> pre-mirnas reported in  <cit> , we extract the  <dig> that have no multiple loops. the sequence similarities between the  <dig> pre-mirnas are calculated using blastclust with s =  <dig>  l =  <dig> , w =  <dig>  only one pre-mirna is then chosen for each cluster to eliminate closely related sequences, which gives us  <dig> non-redundant pre-mirnas. we also check the sequence similarity of these  <dig> pre-mirnas with the  <dig> human pre-mirnas in the training dataset and eliminate one more mirna that has high similarity with entries in the training data. finally, the remaining  <dig> pre-mirnas are used as the updated test set.

the local contiguous structure-sequence features
recent reports have shown that local sequence features are important in pre-mirnas  <cit> . our investigations show that the distributions of local contiguous sub-structures  of pre-mirnas are significantly distinct with that of pseudo pre-mirnas. based on these observations, we propose a set of features that combines the local contiguous structures with sequence information to characterize the hairpin structure of real vs. pseudo pre-mirnas. the features focus on the information of every  <dig> adjacent nucleotides, and we name them as triplet structure-sequence elements or triplet elements for the convenience of discussion.

the rna secondary structures are predicted using rnafold  <cit> . in the predicted secondary structure, there are only two statuses for each nucleotide, paired or unpaired, indicated by brackets ") and dots , respectively. the left bracket "". we don't distinguish these two situations in this work and use " possible structure compositions: " possible structure-sequence combinations, which we denote as "u to produce the 32-dimensional feature vector. it is normalized before being used as input features for svm.

svm classification
support vector machine or svm is used to classify real vs. pseudo pre-mirnas with the 32-dimentional feature vectors. svm is adopted due to its reported good generalization ability  <cit> . the svm classifier is trained with the set tr-c and then applied on all the test sets. we call the whole strategy of using svm with the triplet element features to recognize pre-mirnas as the triplet-svm method.

classification of human real vs. pseudo mirna precursors
when applying svm classifier on the set te-c,  <dig> out of the  <dig> human pre-mirnas are correctly recognized  and  <dig> out of the  <dig> pseudo-mirnas are detected as negative, which gives a sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> % .

1real: real human pre-mirnas.

2pseudo: pseudo pre-mirna hairpins.

on the set conserved-hairpin, the svm classifier identifies  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  potential hairpin structures as false mirnas, which give a specificity of or greater than  <dig> % if we assume all the hairpins in this dataset are not true pre-mirnas .

the high classification accuracies illustrate that the real and pseudo pre-mirnas are quite distinct with regard to the triplet element features, though they share similar hairpin structure. the triplet elements reflect information of the local contiguous fine-structures and the sequence composition. for example, the triplet unit ".

a feature selection criterion reported in dror et al  <cit>  is adopted to analyze the discriminative powers of the different triplet elements. denote xi, i =  <dig> ... <dig> as the  <dig> triplet element features. the means Î¼i+

a. experiments also show that svm performs better when taking the sequence information into the triplet elements, than using just the  <dig> triplet structure features without the nucleotide information. for example, we trained another svm classifier with same training dataset using only the  <dig> triplet structure features. when being applied to the set te-c, the svm classifier correctly recognized  <dig> out of  <dig> human pre-mirnas , but it only detected  <dig> pseudo-mirnas as negative . on the conserved-hairpin set, that svm classifier identified  <dig> out of the  <dig> potential hairpin structures as false pre-mirnas, which gave specificity of or above  <dig> %. we can see that the specificity can be greatly improved when using both structure and sequence information.

applying to all other species
most, if not all, existing mirna prediction methods work on animals and plants separately, since plant mirnas are known to have more heterogeneous hairpin structures than animal mirnas  <cit> . interestingly, when we apply the svm classifier trained with only human data to all other species  where mirnas have been reported, it can correctly identify most of the true pre-mirnas. table  <dig> shows the svm prediction on the cross-species set, which contains  <dig> known pre-mirnas of  <dig> species. any pre-mirnas that are homologous to the human mirnas have been excluded from the set. the svm classifier achieves an overall accuracy of  <dig> % on the cross-species set. especially, it is noticeable that the classifier correctly identifies most the plant and viral pre-mirnas. it is known that plant mirnas usually have longer precursor sequences  <cit> . the success of the triplet-svm classifier across the wide range of different species indicates that there may be local contiguous structure-sequence characteristics that are conserved in pre-mirnas of all species. similarly, when comparing the appearance frequencies of each triplet elements in real pre-mirnas within all the species vs. the pseudo pre-mirnas, their differences are well conserved.

testing on the latest human-specific mirnas
the  <dig> human pre-mirnas from in the updated set were newly reported when this work was almost completed. they are not conserved in closely related species, and therefore existing homology-based methods all fail to identify them  <cit> . with our triplet-svm classifier,  <dig> of the  <dig> new pre-mirnas are correctly recognized, giving an accuracy of  <dig> % . this shows that ab initio mirna predictors like the proposed triplet-svm method can be more powerful in discovering novel or species-specific pre-mirnas.

CONCLUSIONS
a major characteristic that defines mirna precursors is the hairpin structures, but large amounts of similar hairpins can be formed from sequence segments in genomes. ab initio method for distinguishing true pre-mirnas from other pre-mirna-like hairpin structures is important for discovering new and species-specific mirnas. for this purpose, a set of novel features  to describe local contiguous structure-sequence characteristics are extracted, and support vector machine is applied with these features to classify real vs. pseudo pre-mirnas, achieving about 90% accuracy on human test data. remarkably, the triplet-svm classifier built on human data can correctly classify up to 90% of the pre-mirnas from the other  <dig> species including plants and virus without utilizing any comparative genomics information and an accuracy of  <dig> % is achieved on the newly reported novel human mirnas. the local structure-sequence features may contain distinctive and conserved characteristics of mirnas, and the successful ab initio classification of real and pseudo pre-mirnas opens a new approach for discovering new mirnas.

scanning the genome, there could be numerous amounts of sequence segments that can be folded into pre-mirna-like hairpins. the ability to distinguish pseudo vs. real pre-mirnas is essential in the computational identification of novel and species-specific mirnas. since the number of possible candidate hairpins is very large, the current specificity around 89% is still not satisfactory for genome-wide applications and a lot of false positive predictions can be produced. how to find more information to further reduce the false positive rate is what should be sought next. however, latest reports suggested that there may be much more mirnas than the number currently known  <cit> . it might be necessary to reconsider what we previously regard as false-positive predictions. the successful application of the human-based classifier on all other species implies that the biogenesis and processing mechanism of mirnas might be conserved between animals, plants and viruses.
