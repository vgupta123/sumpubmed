BACKGROUND
the mosquito-borne dengue viruses  are responsible for approximately  <dig> million infections and  <dig>  deaths each year with  <dig>  billion people remaining at risk for denv infection, making denv one of the most important viral diseases in the world . infection with one of four antigenically distinct, but related dengue virus serotypes  can result in dengue fever  and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever   <cit> . df and dhf are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of the world, but global changes in climate, rapid dispersal of virus due to ease of global travel, and migration of humans to non-tropical regions has resulted in denv outbreaks in areas that were once non-endemic to the dengue viruses  <cit> . modern travel and shipping inevitably leads to an increase in the number of cases in developed countries as well, including a recent outbreak in the hawaiian islands in  <dig> . these viruses are maintained in a cycle that involves humans as well as the dipteran aedes aegypti mosquito which preferentially feeds on human blood and is widely distributed throughout the world  <cit> .

the current lack of an approved effective tetravalent vaccine and the ineffectiveness of insecticide control measures continue to warrant a search for alternative strategies to effectively combat denv. newer approaches that have received considerable attention include interference with the extrinsic incubation cycle of denv replication within the arthropod vector  <cit> . one such approach envisions population replacement of vector competent mosquitoes with those refractory for infection and/or transmission of the virus, which could theoretically halt disease transmission  <cit> . this approach has distinct advantages for environmental safety, cost effectiveness, and long term disease suppression.

our lab has been exploring anti-denv ribozyme strategies for intracellular suppression of virus infection as a means of transgenic immunization of mosquitoes. in a previous report we examined the effectiveness of hammerhead ribozymes in suppressing denv infection in retrovirus transduced mosquito cells  <cit> . while we identified several ribozymes that are effective in significantly reducing denv 2-ngc infection of ae. albopictus c6/ <dig> cells, our inability to target sequences that are conserved among all serotypes require investigation of additional ribozymes with potential for wider specificity. as an alternative strategy we are investigating the feasibility of utilizing a group i intron trans-splicing strategy to target highly conserved sequences within the denv genome.

the trans-splicing reaction of the group i intron is derived from the natural cis-splicing reaction. both the cis and trans-splicing reaction can be divided into two distinct successive transesterification steps  <cit> . the primary difference between the two reactions is that while the cis-splicing reaction occurs along one continuous rna molecule to join a 5' and a 3' exon, the trans-splicing intron is located on the same molecule as the 3' exon, but seeks out a separate 5' exon to which it can append the 3' exon  <cit> .

the engineered trans-splicing activity of the group i intron is a versatile tool with respect to the 'editing' of rna  <cit> . group i intron trans-splicing has been used in a number of applications, such as: repair of mutant α-globin mrna  <cit> , restoration of wild-type p <dig> activity in three cancerous cell lines  <cit> , re-establishment of the function of the canine skeletal muscle chloride channel  <cit> , and induction of p <dig> activity in a pancreatic cell line  <cit> . more applicable to our research is the trans-splicing group-i intron targeting of the hiv- <dig> tat  <cit> , cucumber mosaic virus coat protein mrnas  <cit> , and the hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site   <cit> .

group i introns are subject to the same limitations as antisense or rnai methods of rna suppression because the high mutation rate of the denv genome promotes the spread of strains capable of avoiding the antisense recognition essential to the trans-splicing reaction. approaches that inhibit denv infection by direct interaction with the rna genome must be designed to act upon invariant sequences to be effective. the most invariant segments of the denv genome are the 5' and the two 3' cyclization sequences  which are involved in the formation of a panhandle structure that is apparently essential for genome replication  <cit> . these cyclization sequences are separated by such a large intervening length of rna that they are effectively acting in a trans manner, and since they are able to base-pair with each other their secondary structure is likely open and conducive to base-pairing.

the 5'cs is located downstream of the polyprotein start codon, well within the orf of the capsid  protein. the stringency of tolerable mutations in this sequence may be increased by the need of the virus to conserve a functional ca protein. in fact, all mosquito-borne flaviviruses share an  <dig> bp stretch of nucleotides within this 5' cs sequence  <cit> .

in this study we designed group i introns to target and catalyze trans-splicing within the conserved sequences of the 5' cs region of denv. these introns cleave either single stranded or homologously paired double stranded rna at defined uracils and covalently join a 3' exon tag to the end of the cleavage product. we evaluated these introns for activity in both transfected and transformed cell cultures to determine their effectiveness in targeting denv sequences. two of these introns, designed 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> gave the greatest number of trans-splice product compared to the other anti-denv group i trans-splicing introns  in each respective series, as judged by luciferase assays. the success of this approach against both subgenomic denv sequences and infecting denv genomes provides a potent anti-viral strategy that should prove useful against this important disease.

RESULTS
analysis of highly conserved elements in the dengue genome
all nucleotide position designations used throughout the study are relative to the published denv-  <dig> new guinea strain c genome . we began by aligning all  <dig> denv genomes and genome fragments from the four different serotypes that were present in genbank using the clustalx program. while overall similarity was highest within a given serotype, the alignment showed a significant conserved region between  <dig> and  <dig> nt having only one variable base at position  <dig> nt . this sequence was wholly contained within the capsid protein gene, and overlapped with the 5'cs identified as essential for replication  <cit> .

design of anti-denv group i trans-splicing introns  targeting conserved denv sequences
the group i intron requires an accessible uracil nucleotide downstream of which the target sequence is cleaved. in a trans-splicing reaction, two separate segments of the intron are utilized to specify the rna sequence the ribozyme targets. the internal guide sequence , a part of the p <dig> helix, and external guide sequence  are each complementary to the target rna sequence . the igs is limited in size to  <dig> base pairs near the reactive uracil while the egs can be of any length and forms a transient helix with the target rna sequence downstream of the reactive uracil  <cit> . biochemical analysis has shown that the activity of group i introns can be enhanced through 5'- and 3'-splice junction base pairing  <cit> .

trans-splicing group i introns promote the joining of a target sequence to a 3' exon through two successive yet independent trans-splicing reactions . the igs and egs of the αdenv-grpi form watson-crick base pairs with the denv 2-ngc target rnas. unintentional expression of the 3' exon, fl, is prevented by an exogenously inserted uaa stop codon immediately upstream of the ucg splice site. an initial transesterification reaction results in cleavage of the target rna in a guanoisine dependent manner with conformational change of the egs. displacement of the distal portion of the p1helix by sequences upstream of the 3' exon forms the p <dig> helix, allowing a second transesterification reaction to take place. this results in ligation of the denv  <dig> ngc genome to the fl 3'exon, promoting firefly expression from the denv capsid aug.

while most strategies for identifying optimal igs sequences utilize a randomized library, called a gn <dig> library, to locate the most accessible uracil within a given target sequence  <cit> , our approach for targeting a specific segment of the denv genome within the denv 5' conserved region limited our choices of uracils, and the gn <dig> library approach was not an option. we therefore employed a more direct approach for our analyses.

anti-denv group i trans-splicing introns  were designed to target two different uracil bases within the identified conserved region. the first set of introns targeted uracil  <dig>  and were designed to effectively trans-splice all known denv sequences . all of these introns included a  <dig> nt antisense external guide sequence  targeting downstream sequences that are also conserved among all denv genomes to improve the targeting capability of the intron and to minimize potential off-target splicing interactions. a single variable base at nt  <dig> is positioned within a non-homologous bulge loop structure that separates the igs and egs, and therefore does not influence the targeting of the intron . this bulge loop structure allows the formation of the p <dig> helix which increases the catalytic efficiency of the intron  <cit> .

intron 9v <dig> was made with a  <dig> base p <dig> helix, and a  <dig> base egs . excluding the wobble base at position u <dig> which is required for proper cleavage  <cit> ,  <dig> bases of this intron interact directly with the intended target sequence.

a second set of αdenv-grpis were constructed with an extended  <dig> base antisense egs that was engineered to specifically bind to the denv- <dig> ngc . each version of this series shared the same egs and p <dig> helix, and targeted the same uracil, u <dig>  but differed in their p <dig> helix. the first version of the  <dig> series, 96v <dig>  was made with a  <dig> base pair p <dig> helix that had no wobble base, and a standard p <dig> helix of  <dig> bases, inclusive of the required wobble base . 96v <dig> is similar to 96v <dig> in all respects except the trimming of  <dig> nucleotides between the p <dig> helix region and the catalytic core. finally, version  <dig> of the  <dig> series  incorporated a wobble base pairing downstream of the 3' exon splice-site. this alteration in the p <dig> helix has been used in published experiments with other group i introns  <cit> . the  <dig> series of introns target a different uracil than  <dig> due to the larger stretch of 100% conserved sequence available for base pairing in the dengue  <dig> alignment, thus the reason for the differences in the nucleotide content of the igs and nucleotide content and length of the egs sequences.

assessing αdenv-grpi activity by firefly luciferase assay in s <dig> cells
since each αdenv-grpi was constructed with a 3' firefly luciferase  orf , we were able to utilize a standard dual luciferase assay to assess the ability of each αdenv-grpi to target the 5'cs region and form a denv2-fl splice product. the formation of this functional splice product can be used to quantitatively gauge the ability of our anti-denv group i introns to reprogram a target sequence either in the form of a double-stranded fold back mimic, or in the context of denv infection.

drosophila s <dig> cells were co-transfected with αdenv-grpi expression plasmids possessing fl as the 3' exon, dsdenv- <dig> substrate expression plasmids, and a renilla luciferase expression plasmid, pa5c-irl, to normalize the readings . as a negative control, cells were co-transfected with the puc <dig> empty vector as a substitute for the substrate, at the same concentration as the dsdenv- <dig> concentration used in the experimentals. s <dig> cells were harvested  <dig> hours post-transfection, processed and analyzed as described in methods. all introns demonstrated firefly luciferase activity, and therefore successful targeting of the pa5c-d2-eyfp-d <dig> construct. αdenv-grpi 96v <dig> produced the greatest amount of luciferase activity, and therefore the greatest amount of trans-spliced product, of all the  <dig> intron series studied . the αdenv-grpi as9v <dig>  designed to target all denv serotypes, also produced significant fl activity verifying its ability to attack our denv mimic in these cells.

engineering and assessment of bicistronic αdenv-grpi 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> intron constructs in drosophila s <dig> cells
since αdenv-grpis 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> were determined to be the best candidate introns of each series by the in vitro assay we assessed the activities of these introns in transfected cell culture assays. each of the introns was tagged downstream of the 3' exon with the mcherry fluorescent marker gene expressed from an ires sequence of either the black queen cell virus  or drosophila c virus  . these dicistrovirus ires sequences were previously determined to yield the highest levels of expression in ae aegypti mosquito and d. melanogaster s <dig> cells  <cit> . this bi-cistronic configuration allowed monitoring for the presence and expression of the αdenv-grpi constructs within cell cultures. as expected, ires-mediated expression of the mcherry fluorescent marker occurred upon transfection of these bi-cistronic constructs in s <dig> cells .

we examined the potential influence addition of the ires-mcherry configuration had on αdenv-grpi activity by performing dual luciferase assays  with our bicistronic αdenv-grpis 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> intron constructs in transient transfected cell culture . d. melanogaster s <dig> cells were transiently transfected with αdenv grpi 9v <dig> or 96v <dig> either unlinked or linked to an ires/mcherry driver, and were challenged with a double-stranded fold back construct designed to mimic the 5'-3' cs region of denv- <dig>  in the presence of the pa5c-irl normalizer. to rule out non-specific targeting of the anti-denv introns to cellular targets, control cells were transfected with the puc <dig> plasmid in lieu of the dsdenv- <dig> construct.

fl activity was greatest for the 96v <dig> ires-mcherry-linked or unlinked constructs in s <dig> cells , with no statistical differences in activities among the 96v <dig> intron constructs. this confirms that addition of the 3' ires/mcherry configuration does not alter the trans-splicing capabilities of the 96v <dig> intron, since equivalent fl counts were obtained for both 96v <dig> and 96v <dig> ires/mcherry constructs.

similarly, the overall activities of the 9v <dig> intron constructs, whether ires-mcherry linked or unlinked, were statistically similar. however, the overall levels of activation were substantially lower than those detected in cells expressing 96v <dig> introns, possibly due to the shorter egs  <cit>  target accessibility leading to a decrease in the production of trans-spliced product.

αdenv-grpis 9v <dig> or 96v <dig>  ires-mcherry linked or unlinked, were either transiently or stably expressed in s <dig> cells, and analyzed by rt-pcr  <dig> hours post-transfection with the dsdenv- <dig> target plasmid using heterologous primers . splice product bands were excised, gel purified, and sequenced to confirm their identity. the specific denv-fl splice product was detected by rt-pcr in transfections with both αdenv-grpi 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> in s <dig> cells as evidenced by the presence of a  <dig> bp band, no splice product was detected in the absence of the target dsdenv- <dig> expression plasmid .

αdenv-grpis effectively target denv- <dig> ngc in mosquito cells
the effectiveness of our αdenv-grpi introns to target infecting denv genomes was assessed by fl assays following denv- <dig> challenge of ae. aegypti aag <dig> cells transiently transfected with αdenv-grpi introns . αdenv-grpi and pa5c-irl expression plasmids were co-transfected into aag <dig> cells, and were challenged with denv- <dig> ngc at an moi of  <dig>   <dig> h post transfection. control cells were transfected with an empty puc <dig> plasmid, in place of the plasmids and challenged with virus in the same manner. each of the αdenv-grpis displayed levels of fl activity indicating successful splicing against the infecting denv. in this case fl activity was only slightly greater for the 96v <dig> ires-mcherry-linked or unlinked constructs in aag <dig> cells, with no statistical differences in activities among the 96v <dig> intron constructs. similarly, the overall activities of the 9v <dig> intron constructs, whether ires-mcherry linked or unlinked, were statistically similar. as seen in the previous assays, the overall levels of activation were somewhat lower than those detected in cells expressing 96v <dig> introns most likely due to the shorter egs  <cit>  or target accessibility. this confirmed the activity of our αdenv-grpis against actual infecting virus, and demonstrated that addition of the 3' ires/mcherry configuration does not appear to alter the ability of the αdenv-grpis tested to target denv genomes in cells. the overall levels of luciferase activity were lower in these virally infected mosquito cells than those observed in s <dig> cells transfected with a plasmid construct expressing an artificial target sequence. this may be due to the role viral infection plays in host cell rna and protein expression, or may be due to potential basic differences in nascent rna and protein expression between these two cell lines.

transient transfection of 9v <dig>  96v <dig> and inactive ribozymes Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> was performed in c6/ <dig> cells followed by rt-pcr analysis to confirm the detection of splice product . no splice product was observed in the presence of the inactive ribozymes Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> showing that the splice product detected is due to the trans-splicing activities of the αdenv-grpis.

since αdenv- grpis 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> were determined to effectively target denv genomes in transiently transfected cells, we assessed the activities of these introns in transformed mosquito cell culture assays . to produce ae. albopictus c6/ <dig> cells transformed with each bicistronic αdenv-grpi intron construct, cells were co-transfected with each αdenv-grpi construct and a plasmid possessing the hygromycin resistance gene. transfection media was replaced with selective media at  <dig> hours post transfection. cells were then passaged several times per week in selection media. the concentration of hygromycin used was increased with each passage until a final concentration of  <dig> mg/ml was reached. mcherry fluorescence and rt-pcr were used to confirm expression of the introns in the transformed cultures.

αdenv-grpis 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> linked to either the bqcv or dcv ires elements expressing mcherry were stably expressed in ae. albopictus c6/ <dig> cells and challenged with denv- <dig> ngc at an moi of  <dig>  at  <dig> h post transfection. control cells were transfected with an empty puc <dig> plasmid and challenged with virus in the same way .

cells were processed and analyzed by rt-pcr  <dig> days post-infection with heterologous primers to detect the denv-fl splice product, and identified bands were excised, gel purified, and sequenced to confirm their identity. denv-2-fl splice product was detected in c6/ <dig> cells when introns were expressed in a transformed cell manner, and whether the intron was linked with either ires-mcherry configuration . no control denv-2-fl splice product was detected by rt-pcr in cells transfected with the puc <dig> control vector. significantly, these results also show that the 9v <dig> intron, designed to be active against all forms of dengue virus, is capable of effectively targeting the denv 2-ngc genome in a sequence specific manner.

expression of αdenv-grpis 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> in mosquito cells leads to suppression of denv- <dig> ngc
the final step in our analysis of these αdenv-grpi constructs was to determine their ability to suppress overall infectious denv- <dig> ngc production in cell culture using tissue culture infectious dose immunofluorescence antibody  assays . αdenv-grpi-fl constructs were stably expressed in c6/ <dig> cells, challenged with denv- <dig> ngc, and assayed as described in methods. αdenv-grpic6/ <dig> cell lines 9v <dig> and  <dig> v <dig> displayed vast reductions in viral titer, up to  <dig> log, when compared to the infection control . suppression of virus replication is evident regardless of whether the intron expressed in the cells was the 96v <dig> trans-splicing intron, engineered to specifically target denv- <dig>  or the 9v <dig> trans-splicing intron, which was designed to target all dengue virus serotypes. this anti-viral effect was independent of the ires-mcherry configuration used in the anti-denv constructs. though the 96v <dig> intron appeared to suppress denv- <dig> ngc replication to a greater extent than 9v <dig>  a direct comparison of activities cannot be considered valid since αdenv-grpis 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> target different uracils .

discussion
like other flaviviruses, denv enter the cell by receptor mediated endocytosis ). following acidification of the endosome and membrane fusion the  <dig>  kb positive-sensed denv genome is released into the cytoplasm where replication begins. this is an ideal place for a trans-splicing ribozyme to attack the denv genome. one strategy currently under development to directly attack the dengue genome is the use of the rnai response in mosquitoes  <cit> . it is logical to assume that the wild-type rnai response mounted by the mosquito itself in reaction to an infection is not strong enough to protect against the spread of the virus, or dengue would cease to be a concern. however, pre-priming mosquito cells for rnai protection against dengue through the expression of dengue-specific dsrna before any infection occurs is an effective approach, severely hindering replication of the virus in some cases  <cit> . as efficient as it is, this tactic suffers from the same drawbacks as the vaccine: escape mutants. the error rate of the dengue rna polymerase suggests that, on average, one random mutation arises for every replication event. previous work has shown limited mismatching of the risc complex rna to its target is tolerated to a degree  <cit> . in contrast, the ability of an induced rnai response to discriminate between different alleles of the same gene varying only by a single nucleotide has also been observed  <cit> . whether or not a particular mutation within the targeted region confers resistance appears to depend on the location of the altered base as well as the nature of the alteration itself. selective pressure within the cells of a mosquito may initially silence a dengue infection, but eventually that pressure would serve to promote the replication of virus genomes carrying mutations conferring resistance to the risc complex nuclease activity. such mutants would be transmitted by the insect and spread throughout a population even in the presence of the protective measures granted by rnai, eventually rendering the specific sequence utilized in priming a mosquito for an rnai response useless in the face of the escape mutant strain of dengue.

the experiments presented here are not conducted in a way that one can assess if the grp- <dig> approach is superior or inferior to sirna/shrnas. sirna does not carry out splicing, and our research was meant to establish that we had successfully designed grpi introns that do target and splice conserved sequences. further, an abundance of sirna work has already been performed with denv  <cit>  and this sequence is not among those identified as useful for targeting because the length of conservation for this sequence among all denv is smaller than required for an sirna response.

group i trans-splicing introns have a demonstrated potential for targeting rna virus genomes in infected cells  <cit> . in this report we demonstrate the feasibility of using αdenv-grpis to catalyze trans-splicing of the 5' conserved region of the denv family genomes. in designing group i intron splicing approaches most studies employ a gn <dig> library scan to map those uracils most accessible to trans-splicing in an otherwise highly invariant sequence  <cit> . the highly mutable nature of the dengue genome precludes this approach, as any uracils identified may or may not be present in other serotypes or even other strains of the same serotype.

in addition to the questionable presence of the uracil, the immediate neighboring sequence must also be conserved to facilitate targeting through base pairing interactions. we determined our optimal group i intron target following alignment of  <dig> instances of denv from genbank which identified one conserved region that appeared to satisfy the requirements for trans-splicing within the denv genome. this region is positioned within the capsid coding sequence at nucleotides c <dig> to g <dig>  <cit> , and contains a number of possible uracil targets for the trans-splicing reaction. this region is a part of a double-stranded 5'-3'cs domain that forms as a result of complementary base pairing between the proximal ends of the 5' and 3' utrs during denv replication  <cit> . the formation of the 5-3'cs domain has been shown to be essential for denv replication  <cit> . we designed anti-denv group i trans-splicing introns  to target two of these uracil bases within the identified conserved region, u <dig> and u <dig> 

intron 9v <dig>  which has a  <dig> base p <dig> helix, and a  <dig> base egs , is designed to effectively trans-splice all known denv sequences. this intron demonstrated an ability to cleave at u <dig> and effectively trans-splice an infecting denv  <dig> ngc genome either upon transfection of aag <dig> cells or as a constitutively expressed rna in transformed c6/ <dig> cells.

a separate set of αdenv-grpis were constructed with an extended  <dig> base antisense egs that was engineered to target the denv- <dig> ngc . each version of this series shares the same egs and p <dig> helix, and targets u <dig>  but differs in their p <dig> helix. 96v <dig> has a  <dig> base pair p <dig> helix with no wobble base, and a standard p <dig> helix including the required wobble base . 96v <dig> differs from 96v <dig> in trimming of  <dig> nucleotides between the p <dig> helix and the catalytic core, while 96v <dig> incorporates a wobble base pairing downstream of the 3' exon splice-site.

each αdenv-grpi was constructed with a 3' firefly luciferase  orf that permitted quantitative assessment of splicing activity. co-transfection assays for fl activity were performed in s <dig> or aag <dig> cells using the fold back denv- <dig> mimic plasmid and either bqcv or dcv ires/mcherry-linked αdenv-grpi 9v <dig> or 96v4expression plasmids introns. although all introns assayed exhibited firefly luciferase activity, αdenv-grpi as96v <dig> displayed the greatest amount of luciferase activity, and therefore the greatest amount of trans-spliced product. this is likely due to both the relative activity of the intron configuration as well as an increased efficiency of targeting as a result of the extended egs. the αdenv-grpi as9v <dig>  designed to target all denv serotypes, also displayed a significant ability to successfully splice our denv mimic in these cells, but its reduced level of fl activity reflects a somewhat reduced efficiency of targeting relative to αdenv-grpi as96v <dig>  this is likely due to the presence of a shorter egs, as this has been previously shown to decrease the ability of a trans-splicing intron to attack a target sequence  <cit> . alternatively, the relative effectiveness of cleavage for u <dig> targeted by the 9v <dig> intron may be less than that for u <dig> targeted by the 96v <dig> introns. nonetheless, this intron was still quite effective in targeting and splicing the denv sequence.

similar results were obtained when aag <dig> cells transfected with these αdenv grpi constructs were challenged by infection with denv- <dig> ngc. these results validated the potential of our αdenv-grpi intron approach as an effective means of suppressing denv infection of mosquito cells and tissues.

we also observed that addition of a 3' ires/mcherry configuration, whether incorporating the bqcv ires or the dcv ires, does not appear to alter the trans-splicing capabilities of either intron, because the ires allows expression of the mcherry fluorescence marker in the unspliced intron, this provides a convenient independent marker for determining the relative efficiency of expression of the introns following transfection.

the potential of these intron constructs to function in transformed mosquito tissues was confirmed by demonstrating their activity against infectious denv- <dig> ngc in transformed c6/ <dig> cells expressing the bicistronic αdenv-grpis 9v <dig> or 96v <dig>  either linked with the bqcv or dcv ires driven mcherry, or lacking an ires mcherry linkage . rt-pcr amplified denv-2-fl splice product confirms the ability of both αdenv grpi 9v <dig> and 96v <dig> constructs in targeting denv- <dig> ngc. a decreased band intensity of the denv-2-fl splice product was obtained with αdenv-grpi 9v <dig> compared to that resulting from αdenv-grpi 96v <dig> activity, and may once again be due to differences in the lengths egs of these two introns since egs length is a determining factor for grpi trans-splicing efficiency  <cit> .

further validation of these introns as potent tools to combat denv is evidenced by tcid50-ifa analyses that test suppression of overall infectious virus production . a  <dig> log  to  <dig> log  was observed demonstrating these αdenv-grpis do suppress denv 2-ngc infection of the transformed cells, and the αdenv-grpi 9v <dig>  designed to target all four dengue serotypes, has the ability to suppress the replication of all serotypes of this virus.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here show that the 9v <dig> intron, designed to be active against all forms of dengue virus, is capable of effectively targeting the denv 2-ngc genome in a sequence specific manner, while suppressing virus production. these novel αdenv-grpis provide an attractive alternative to other rna based approaches for the transgenic suppression of denv in transformed mosquito cells and tissues.
