BACKGROUND
osteosarcoma  is the most common malignant bone tumor among children and adolescents with an incidence of  <dig>  cases per million per year in the united states  <cit> . osa is also the most common spontaneous primary bone tumor of dogs, estimated to affect greater than  <dig>  dogs annually in the united states  <cit> . tumor morphology, biological behavior, progression of disease and molecular characteristics are very similar in dogs and humans  <cit> . consequently, dogs provide a valuable comparative model of human osa. standard of care therapy for both human and canine osa patients remains a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, with five-year survival rates reported in humans as high as 70%  <cit>  and median survival in canine patients around 200 days  <cit> . unfortunately, in both human and canine patients approximately 80% are estimated to have micrometastases at presentation, some of whose tumors are also refractory to chemotherapy  <cit> . these patients continue to have a poor prognosis. histologic classification alone has not proven clinically relevant for determination of tumors likely to metastasize or exhibit resistance to chemotherapy protocols. the focus of recent research, therefore, has turned toward molecular characterization of primary tumors, especially aberrant gene and/or protein expression that might correlate with prognosis or chemotherapy sensitivity.

hairy and enhancer of split  <dig> , a basic helix-loop-helix  transcriptional repressor, is a downstream target of the notch signaling pathway. the intracellular domain of activated notch receptors  translocates to the nucleus, forms a transcriptional activating complex with recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa j region  and activates expression of target genes including hes <dig>  <cit> . the hes <dig> protein contains both dna-binding and protein-protein interaction domains important for its function as a transcriptional regulator   <cit> . notch-independent hes <dig> expression can also result from hedgehog and c-jun n-terminal kinase  signaling as well as from ras/mapk signaling  <cit> . regulation of hes <dig> expression and activity is dependent on the tissue, spatial and temporal factors, and the proteins with which it interacts  <cit> .

overexpression of notch and/or hes <dig> is associated with a variety of human cancers including t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia , and ovarian, breast, cervical, prostate, colon and non-small cell lung cancers  <cit> . notch/hes <dig> has also been shown to have tumor suppressor activity in some cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, b-cell all, myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma  <cit> . in human osa, notch is implicated in osa cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis  <cit> . increased hes <dig> mrna expression was shown in some human osa cells and osa tumor samples compared to osteoblasts or normal bone and an association between high hes <dig> expression and decreased survival of osa patients has been suggested  <cit> . reduced invasiveness in response to suppression of notch signaling and hes <dig> activity implicates notch/hes <dig> signaling in metastasis  <cit> . another study suggests both up-regulation of notch and increased expression of hes <dig> in one osa cell line occurs in response to activation of the wnt/β-catenin pathway  <cit> .

during bone development there is significant cross talk between the wnt/β-catenin, hedgehog, and notch pathways affecting osteoblast differentiation and maturation and influencing hes <dig> expression  <cit> . like notch and wnt/β-catenin, aberrant hedgehog signaling is also associated with development of human cancers  <cit> . previous studies in our lab identified decreased expression of three hedgehog pathway associated genes in osa tumors from dogs with a disease free interval  < 100 days  compared with tumors from dogs with a dfi >  <dig>   <cit> .

in order to explore the hypothesis that notch signaling would be altered in canine osa compared to normal bone samples, the current study examines the expression of notch <dig> and  <dig> receptors and signaling targets, hes <dig> and hey <dig>  in canine osa samples from patients with known outcome and normal bone tissues. immunohistochemical analysis of hes <dig> protein was assessed in kaplan-meyer survival analysis to confirm the association of decreased hes <dig> expression with a shorter dfi.

methods
tumor donors
chemotherapy-naïve primary tumor samples were selected from the colorado state university  flint animal cancer center’s tissue archive. samples are archived with owner consent and approval by the csu institutional animal care and use committee. twenty tumors from good- and poor-responders  were selected following the protocol previously published  <cit> . briefly, chemotherapy-naïve primary osa samples were from dogs treated with surgical amputation followed by chemotherapy with doxorubicin and/or a platinum based drug . all twenty dogs were free of thoracic metastases by radiographic analysis at diagnosis and follow up consisted of evaluation by clinical examinations including thoracic radiographs every 2–3 months after initial treatment. disease free interval  was calculated from surgery until development of metastatic disease and samples were identified for cohorts of good responders  and poor responders  in order to flank the median dfi . nine additional appendicular osa tumor samples were collected from which matched normal metaphyseal bone was harvested from the same limb  following amputation. these nine matched samples were collected at amputation as cases came in  and absence/presence of metastasis, post-operative treatment, and patient follow-up were less consistent in this population. tumor and normal bone fragments collected at amputation were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°c. tumor fragments were also fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours with subsequent routine processing and paraffin embedding.

immunohistochemical hes <dig> expression was also assessed in a subset of canine appendicular osa patients from a previously reported multi-institutional randomized prospective clinical trial  <cit> . the study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committees of the participating institutions. all dogs underwent amputation followed by 5 cycles of adjuvant doxorubicin, with or without an investigational matrix metalloprotease inhibitor. inclusion/exclusion criteria, staging, and follow-up procedures were standardized and tumor tissues were processed as previously reported  <cit> . histologic grading  was performed by one author  utilizing a schema incorporating amount of matrix, percent necrosis, nuclear pleomorphism, nucleolar size/number and mitosis score  <cit> . mitotic index was calculated by counting the number of mitotic figures per  <dig> random 400× fields.

cell culture
canine cell lines used in this study were provided by dr. douglas thamm; all cell lines were validated for species and genetic identity using short-tandem-repeat  profiling as previously described  <cit> . human osa cell lines were obtained from dr. douglas thamm , dr. hue luu , or purchased from atcc . the mg <dig>  cell line is a metastatic sub-line of the mg <dig> line, obtained via serial passage of rare lung metastases from mg <dig>  <cit> . all non-purchased cell lines were validated prior to use using str profiling by the university of colorado dna sequencing shared resource. cells were cultured in c <dig> media , 1 mm of sodium pyruvate, 2× mem vitamins, 1× mem non-essential amino acids, 1× antibiotic-antimycotic  , and 10% fetal bovine serum  .

rna extraction
total rna was extracted from tumors and rt-qpcr was conducted as described previously  <cit> . briefly, samples were freeze-fractured, homogenized, extracted with trizol reagent  and purified with rneasy clean up  following manufacturer’s protocols. rna was extracted from normal bone using the same protocol with an additional spin of 800× g at 4°c for 5 minutes following homogenization. the supernatant was carried forward through the trizol protocol. total rna was extracted from human and canine osa cells using the rneasy kit  per the manufacturer’s protocol. rna was quantified via spectrophotometry and bioanalyzed for integrity as described in o’donaghue et al.  <cit>  with samples used having a rna integrity number of at least  <dig>  human adult osteoblast total rna was purchased from cell applications, inc.

reverse transcriptase pcr and quantitative real time pcr
cdna synthesis was completed using the quantitect reverse transcription kit  with  <dig> or 3 μg input rna. rt-qpcr of cdna was run using iq sybr green supermix  and 25 ng equivalent rna input in 25 μl reactions on a stratagene mx3000p instrument. expression in canine cells and tissues was normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase  <dig>  expression. hprt <dig> was selected based on its consistent moderate expression in our sample sets in prior microarray and rt-qpcr analysis  and its previous use as a canine reference gene  <cit> . consistent with current recommendations for the selection of reference genes and because no single reference gene exhibited unchanged expression between samples, expression in human osa cells was normalized to the geometric mean of four reference genes; ribosomal protein s <dig> , glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase , 18s ribosomal rna  and hprt <dig> <cit> . primer sequences and efficiencies for all genes and the full sequence of the canine hes <dig> amplicon are listed in additional file  <dig>  primers were designed using primer-blast based upon ncbi refseq mrna sequences when available. primers were designed to be intron spanning when possible and cross-checked for specificity via ucsc in silico pcr. primers were further validated with standard curves to calculate efficiency, and dissociation curves as previously described  <cit> . rt-qpcr products were validated for size by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced to confirm identity. the 161 bp canine hes <dig> amplicon revealed 98% homology to the human homolog of hes <dig>  human hes <dig> primers used were the same as those used by zhang et al.  <cit> . the identity of the 200 bp amplicon was verified as human hes <dig> by dideoxy sequencing .

western blot
western blot analysis was performed on canine and human osa cells using whole cell lysates or cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. whole cell lysates were prepared in triethanolamine  lysis buffer  with 1× complete protease inhibitor cocktail . protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid  protein assay . nuclear extracts were prepared using a hypotonic  <dig> % or  <dig> % igepal  buffer . briefly, harvested cell pellets were re-suspended in igepal buffer with protease inhibitor while vortexing, incubated on ice for 0–5 minutes, and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500× g. the supernatant  was collected and the pellet  was re-suspended in tea lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. samples were separated using sds-page and transferred to a polyvinylidine fluoride membrane. the membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk  for one hour at room temperature and incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-hes <dig> antibody  in 5% bovine serum albumin  at 4°c overnight. after washing in  <dig> % tween 20-tris-buffered saline  the membrane was incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody  in 5% nfdm for one hour at room temperature. supersignal west dura extended duration substrate  was used to detect chemiluminescent signals. band intensity from four experiments using whole cell lysates from mg <dig> and mg <dig>  cell lines were analyzed using imagej software. the intensity of the hes <dig> band was normalized to the corresponding α-tubulin loading control.

immunohistochemistry 
ihc to detect hes <dig> expression was performed on 4 μm sections from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded  tumor tissues using standard immunoperoxidase techniques on charged slides with hematoxylin counter stain. slides with sections were heated at 60°c for 30 minutes, allowed to cool, and deparaffinized with xylene or a citrus based clearing solution , and rehydrated with descending ethanol concentrations in deionized water . heat induced epitope retrieval was done with 10 mm sodium citrate buffer  heated in a pressure cooker for 1 minute at 125°c. endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide at room temperature for 5 minutes with  <dig> washes in tbst both before and after. slides were incubated with a non-serum protein block  at room temperature for 15 minutes followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4°c overnight. the primary antibody  was used at a dilution of 1: <dig> . sections were then incubated with a prediluted secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase  for 30 minutes at room temperature with  <dig> tbst washes both before and after. diaminobenzidine  was used as a chromogen for immunoreactive complex detection and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.

sixty-one additional ffpe tumor samples were analyzed for hes <dig> immunohistochemical expression utilizing a protocol similar to that described above with the following exceptions: primary antibody was diluted in  <dig> % normal goat serum in tbst , and detection was performed using biotinylated anti-rabbit igg antibody in a vectastain abc kit . the ihc was performed in five batches of  <dig> to  <dig> slides each with the same antibody dilution used for an entire batch. variations in antibody dilutions were controlled for by inclusion of a positive control tumor slide with a total immunoreactivity score of  <dig> . all samples within each batch were scored in reference to the control. negative controls lacking primary antibody were included in each batch.

hes <dig> antibody validation was done using human placenta and canine lung and pancreas as positive control tissues. specificity of the primary antibody was verified using a hes <dig> blocking peptide . briefly, primary antibody was incubated with 25×  blocking peptide in antibody diluents  for one hour at room temperature before application to canine control and sample tumor slides. positive and negative controls with sections from the same tissues were incubated in parallel.

immunohistochemical scoring of all slides was performed independently by two authors blinded to case information. a positive cell was any neoplastic cell with distinct brown staining in the nucleus . the percentage of positive cells in each sample was estimated based on an average of two or more high powered fields and scored as follows, 1: < 50% cells stain positive, 2: 50-75% cells stain positive, 3: > 75% cells stain positive. average stain intensity ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . field location and number were selected randomly at the discretion of the individual scorer. the product of the percentage and intensity scores made up the overall immunoreactivity score . both scorers simultaneously reviewed slides with conflicting scores   and consensus was reached. after review, total scores were averaged for statistical analyses.

immunocytochemistry 
immunocytochemistry was performed utilizing the same reagents and a similar protocol to that used for ihc. slides were prepared via cytospin and dried overnight. prior to the blocking step cells were fixed with 100% methanol at room temperature for 15 minutes, allowed to dry, washed in ttbs and incubated in  <dig> % tritonx- <dig> in tbs for 7–12 minutes. the remainder of the procedure was identical to that used for ihc, but a higher concentration of primary antibody  was used.

photomicrographs  were taken using the olympus bx <dig> research system microscope with an olympus dp <dig> digital camera system. minimal additional editing was done in microsoft ® powerpoint ® for mac  <dig> 

gene expression microarray analysis
total rna from primary osa tumor samples from dogs with dfi <  <dig>  and dfi >  <dig>  was analyzed on genechip canine  <dig>  genome arrays  at csu’s rocky mountain regional center for excellence  genomics core per affymetrix protocols as described  <cit> . normal bone samples  were analyzed using an identical protocol. samples used for microarray analysis were a subset of those used for rt-qpcr . microarray pre-processing combining the osteosarcoma samples with the normal bone samples was conducted using probe logarithmic intensity error  estimation algorithms with log <dig> transformations. probesets including notch receptor ligands, effectors, or targets of either the canonical notch pathway or hes <dig> were selected based on literature review, ingenuity® systems pathway analysis, and/or inclusion in the human notch signaling pathway rt <dig> profiler™ pcr array  . cimminer was used to generate clustered images of the data from the  <dig> selected probesets with unsupervised clustering on both axes and the following parameters: average linkage, euclidean distance, and quantile binning with median centering of the data. full microarray data for the dfi groups is available through ncbi’s gene expression omnibus  via accession number gse <dig> 

statistics
statistical analysis of rt-qpcr and immunohistochemistry data  was performed using prism software . for rt-qpcr data standard curves, dissociation curves and amplification data was collected on a stratagene mx3000p instrument and analyzed using the rest <dig> software  <cit> . hes <dig> rt-qpcr data was also analyzed using the  <dig> method  <cit>  with similar results. ihc scores for the dfi >  <dig> and dfi <  <dig> tumors were analyzed with a 2-tailed fischer’s exact test after separating scores into low expression  and high expression  categories. the cut off was based on results of receiver-operating characteristic  analysis of immunohistochemical scores for the dfi >  <dig> and dfi <  <dig> groups. welch t-test in arraytrack  <dig> . <dig> with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons  was used to compare microarray gene expression data. significance was defined as p <  <dig>   or q <  <dig>  .

statistical analysis of survival data was performed using a combination of prism and spss software version  <dig> for macintosh . correlations between hes <dig> expression levels and other markers on a continuous scale were evaluated using linear regression analysis. a 2-tailed, unpaired t-test was used to evaluate the association between hes <dig> expression levels and categorical markers. the median dfi was estimated using the kaplan-meier method, and comparisons between groups made using log rank analysis for categorical variables. for continuous variables, markers were categorized into a low and high group using the median value as the break point. multivariable cox regression analysis was then performed, utilizing both forward and backward stepwise models. variables identified with a univariate p-value of < <dig>  were included in the multivariate analysis. for all other tests, p-values of < <dig>  were considered significant.

RESULTS
gene expression analysis of notch/hes1-associated genes groups normal and osa bone samples, but does not distinguish dfi groups
to assess the biological relevance of notch/hes <dig> signaling in canine osteosarcoma, probesets including notch receptor ligands, effectors, or targets of either the canonical notch pathway or hes <dig> were selected from canine  <dig>  gene array data and analyzed for differential gene expression as described in materials and methods. unbiased cluster analysis of data for the  <dig> notch/hes1-associated genes separated normal bone from tumors, but did not discriminate between the dfi groups . in total,  <dig> of  <dig>  notch/hes <dig> pathway associated genes examined were significantly different between tumor and normal bone ; 23/ <dig>  had increased expression in tumors. specifically, mrna expression of notch <dig> and notch <dig> was elevated in tumor samples compared to normal bone . none of the genes evaluated had significantly different expression between dfi groups when corrected for multiple comparisons. hes <dig> was not included on the canine  <dig>  chip, but hey <dig>  another notch target, was also elevated in tumors compared to normal bone .

rt-qpcr analysis for notch <dig>  notch <dig>  hey <dig> and hes <dig> was conducted on the normal bone/matched osa and dfi tumor sample sets . notch <dig> exhibited decreased expression in the dfi < 100 day group relative to normal bone , with no other significant changes measured. this result differed from the  <dig>  fold upregulation of notch <dig> identified in the gene array analysis, however previous studies have shown that fold-change differences < <dig>  are frequently unreliable  <cit> . consistent with the array data, notch <dig> exhibited an approximate 4-fold elevation in expression in both sets of dfi tumors, separately and in combination, relative to normal bone . similarly, hey <dig> expression was elevated in each tumor group by a fold-change ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  . rt-qpcr analysis of these notch signaling pathway elements confirmed our finding that notch signaling is elevated in tumors relative to normal bone, but not between tumors in the two dfi groups.

hes <dig> mrna expression in tumors and its prognostic significance
rt-qpcr was also used to assess hes <dig> mrna levels in osa tumor and matched normal bone samples. average hes <dig> mrna expression was elevated  <dig> -fold in canine osa tumors compared to the matched normal bone ; however, this fold change was highly variable when each osa tumor was compared to its matched normal bone sample, with  <dig> tumors exhibiting elevated expression compared to normal bone and  <dig> tumors having virtually unchanged expression .

we also assessed mrna levels for hes <dig> in tumors taken from dogs with a dfi <100 days or dfi >300 days following treatment by amputation and chemotherapy. we found that hes <dig> expression was elevated  <dig> -fold in the dfi >  <dig> tumors compared to the dfi <  <dig> group . hes <dig> expression in the dfi <  <dig> group was not different from the normal bone samples.

messenger rna levels of hes <dig> were measured in canine and human osteosarcoma cell lines and confirmed using western blot analysis using a rabbit monoclonal anti-human hes <dig> antibody as described to determine if hes <dig> mrna levels correlated to protein expression, . comparison of canine and human amino acid sequence of the hes <dig> gene identified 86% homology in the epitope targeted by this antibody. this was based on the predicted amino acid sequence of ncbi reference sequence xm_ <dig> , which has been removed as a result of standard genome annotation processing. no additional canine hes <dig> record is currently available. western blot analysis of whole cell osa cell lysates revealed a  <dig> kd protein  as well as larger non-specific bands . given the role of hes <dig> as a transcriptional regulator, we hypothesized that active hes <dig> protein would reside in the nucleus. western blot analysis of isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from both canine and human osa cell lines confirmed enrichment of the  <dig> kd hes- <dig> protein in the nuclear fraction  while the non-specific bands were enriched in the cytoplasm fraction . since equal amounts of total protein were loaded in each lane, the increased intensity and/or number of nonspecific bands in the cytoplasmic fraction were likely the result of concentration of these cytoplasmic proteins relative to total protein. experiments using human osa cells showed similar results .

hes <dig> mrna and protein expression varied between cell lines in both canine and human osa cells . for human cell lines mrna expression was similar to that previously published  <cit> . in general, hes <dig> mrna expression was increased in canine cell lines relative to normal canine bone tissue  and in human osa cell lines relative to human osteoblasts . western blot analysis showed a characteristic band at 30 kda with variable expression between cell lines . interestingly, the metastatic subline of mg <dig> cells, mg <dig> , exhibited elevated levels of mrna compared to the mg <dig> line, but protein expression was not significantly different between the two lines .

we validated immunoreactivity using ffpe human placenta and found positive strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of placental macrophages , moderate nuclear +/- cytoplasmic staining of stromal cells and light nuclear staining of endothelial cells consistent with notch activity in placenta reported by herr et al.  <cit> . staining of additional canine control tissues revealed positive punctate to diffuse intranuclear staining of pancreatic cells, endothelial cells and subsets of pulmonary epithelial cells as described in human literature  <cit>  . addition of a blocking peptide specific for the epitope targeted by our antibody eliminated all staining . immunocytochemistry of canine osa cells  showed diffuse nuclear staining consistent with the specific 30 kda protein identified in the nuclear lysate by western analysis .

increased immunohistochemical hes <dig> staining is associated with increased disease free interval
once we established that the rabmab anti-human hes <dig> antibody provided specific targeting of hes <dig> protein in human cultured cells and ffpe tissues with good cross-reactivity in canine samples, we performed immunohistochemistry using canine primary osa samples. of the  <dig> tumor samples from the canine dfi >  <dig> and dfi <  <dig> tumor groups,  <dig> were scored as described in the methods . for six samples, ihc was not possible due to loss of tissue during processing or poor quality/quantity of staining/tissue present. all osa samples evaluated with immunohistochemistry had variable positive staining for hes <dig> both across tumors and within tumors. the staining pattern of tumor cells was predominantly nuclear with diffuse cytoplasmic staining less common. the median hes <dig> reactivity score was  <dig> . of the  <dig> tumors from dogs with dfi > 300 days,  <dig> %  had a score of greater than  <dig>  compared to only  <dig> %  of the  <dig> tumors from dogs with dfi < 100 days . consistent with our rt-qpcr results, average hes <dig> immunohistochemical staining was lower in tumors from dogs with dfi < 100 days, but because of low power did not reach statistical significance .

to further assess the utility of hes <dig> protein expression as a prognostic biomarker, we performed ihc on  <dig> primary canine osa tissues from a subset of dogs in a previously reported prospective clinical trial  <cit> . demographic information for this patient population is supplied in additional file  <dig>  ihc scores were assigned as described in materials and methods. hes <dig> was expressed in all tumors with a median hes <dig> immunoreactivity score of  <dig> in this population . the overall median dfi was  <dig> . the median dfi in dogs with a high hes <dig> immunoreactivity score  was 258 days compared to 155 days in dogs with a low hes <dig> immunoreactivity score  . univariate analysis identified hes <dig>  bone-specific alkaline phosphatase  activity, histologic grade, percent necrosis and mitotic index as potential predictors of dfi . upon multivariate analysis, hes <dig>  percent necrosis and mitotic index retained statistical significance  as independent predictors of dfi. in summary, consistent with our prior rt-qpcr analysis, increased hes <dig> expression was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker for increased disease free survival in  <dig> canine osas treated by amputation and chemotherapy.

discussion
expression of hes <dig> mrna is frequently utilized as an indicator of notch activity and notch/hes <dig> activation has been implicated in a variety of human cancers with oncogenic activity in some tumor types and tumor suppressor activity in others  <cit> . the goals of this study were to evaluate expression of notch receptors and signaling mediators, hes <dig> and hey <dig>  in canine osa samples from dogs with dfi > 300 days and dfi < 100 days as well as samples of matched osa and normal bone to explore associations with osa progression and patient outcome. gene array analysis focusing on  <dig> notch/hes <dig> associated genes identified elevated expression of notch signaling mediators in tumors relative to normal bone. we confirmed a statistically significant elevation of notch <dig>  hey <dig>  and hes <dig> mrna expression in osa when compared with normal bone. interestingly, we did not find elevated hes <dig> expression in the most aggressive osa when comparing good and poor responders, but instead identified a statistically significant association between high hes <dig> mrna and protein expression and longer dfi following standard treatment. further, the gene array analysis of notch/hes <dig> associated genes and rt-qpcr analysis of notch <dig>  notch <dig> and hey <dig> showed no significant differences in expression between the dfi groups. overall, our findings indicate that alterations in notch signaling occur during the development of canine osa, but mechanisms that do not alter hes <dig> expression may drive the most aggressive tumors.

the oncogenic role of notch signaling in osa in humans is supported by previous studies  <cit> ; however, the specific role of hes <dig> is less clear. a common finding regarding hes <dig> expression between these previous studies and ours is the variability of expression within human and canine osa cells and tumors   <cit> . for example, hes <dig> mrna expression in tumors relative to normal bone was elevated in  <dig> of  <dig> canine tumors relative to matched normal bone samples in our study  and  <dig> of  <dig> human tumors in the tanaka study  <cit> . there is also disagreement among studies as to which notch receptors and target genes are functionally significant in osa. zhang et al. provided evidence that increased notch <dig> activity and notch1-induced expression of hes <dig> specifically are associated with invasion and metastasis in two osa cell lines, the low hes <dig> expressing saos <dig> parental line and the metastatic, high hes <dig> expressing lm <dig> sub-line  <cit> . inhibition of notch signaling by a gamma-secretase inhibitor suppressed lm <dig> osa cell invasion, but had no effect on proliferation or tumorigenesis; whereas induced expression of intracellular cleaved notch <dig>  or hes <dig> in the saos <dig> line increased invasiveness. tanaka et al. identified elevations of notch <dig> and hey <dig> mrna in human osa biopsy specimens relative to normal bone, but notch <dig> and hes <dig> mrna expression was not consistently elevated. in the same study, treatment of osa cells and tumors grown in nude mice with a gamma-secretase inhibitor reduced proliferation through a g <dig> block  <cit> . differing results in these two studies may be due to different samples studied  and/or the use of different gamma-secretase inhibitors. our rt-qpcr data suggests that notch <dig> and hey <dig> may be primary mediators of notch signaling in canine osa as well. interestingly, zhang et al. observed both elevated hes <dig> mrna expression  <cit>  and elevated hes <dig> protein expression  <cit>  in the lm <dig> metastatic sub-line relative to the saos <dig> parent line. we also observed an increase in hes <dig> mrna expression in the mg <dig>  metastatic sub-line relative to the mg <dig> parent line. however, western blot analysis identified similar levels of hes <dig> protein in the mg <dig> and mg <dig>  lines suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation may be important.

studies exploring the relationship between hes <dig> expression and patient outcome in osa are limited. our rt-qpcr results  revealed significantly increased hes <dig> mrna expression in canine osa from dogs with a longer dfi compared to those with a short dfi. this relationship was confirmed by immunohistochemical examination of hes <dig> protein in a larger dataset . these results conflict with those of hughes who conducted a rt-qpcr study using tissue from  <dig> primary osas that suggested lower hes <dig> mrna expression may be associated with a better prognosis  <cit> . discrepancy from our results may be due to differing sample sizes, different measurements of outcome and different outcome groupings. despite evidence of strong molecular similarities of canine and human osa and high conservation of notch/hes <dig> between species, there is also the possibility that canine tumors may exhibit different characteristics than their human counterparts. until similar studies to evaluate nuclear immunoreactivity as a measure of protein expression are carried out in human tumors, no firm conclusions regarding possible differences in canine and human osa with respect to hes <dig> expression can be made.

previous studies examining hes <dig> expression in other cancers or during development provide candidate mechanisms for reduced hes <dig> expression in the presence of elevated notch signaling: uncoupling of hes <dig> from notch signaling, cell cycle regulation of hes <dig> expression, and post-transcriptional regulation. hes <dig> expression has been reported to be uncoupled from notch signaling in ewing’s sarcoma  <cit>  and stimulation of hes <dig> transcription by sonic hedgehog  pathway occurs in mesodermal and neural stem cells . using rt-qpcr analysis, we identified significantly decreased smo mrna expression  in the dfi <  <dig> tumors compared to the dfi >  <dig> tumors  <cit>  suggesting that reduced hes <dig> expression in aggressive canine osa might reflect a loss of shh signaling. hes <dig> expression oscillations are both observed and necessary for cell cycle progression during neuronal development  <cit> ; aggressive osa tumor cells may utilize hes <dig> oscillatory patterns to manipulate the cell cycle and optimize their ability to metastasize and/or resist chemotherapy. finally, several mirnas have been shown to regulate hes <dig>   <cit>  and may contribute to altered hes <dig> expression in osa cells and tumors.

in addition, hes <dig> protein may exhibit specific functions depending on its phosphorylation status and binding partners. kannan et. al. found that interactions with hes <dig> stimulates parp <dig> activation and cleavage, ultimately resulting in apoptosis in b-all   <cit> . further, in neuronal development, ju et al. showed that hes <dig> interactions with phosphorylated parp <dig> released hes <dig> from the hes1/groucho/tle repressor complex and, upon hes <dig> phosphorylation, led to association with a co-activator complex, changing the role of hes <dig> from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator  <cit> . in bone development, via inhibition of runx <dig>  notch activity maintains a population of committed osteoblast precursors  <cit> . interestingly, several studies also show that hes <dig> binding stabilizes and activates runx <dig> protein; thus, hes <dig> has been shown to both inhibit and enhance the activity of runx <dig>  <cit> . additional studies exploring the phosphorylation status and binding partners of hes <dig> may provide a better understanding of these interactions in osa.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the current study support the association of notch pathway activation with the proliferative response of osa. however, reduced hes <dig> expression in the most aggressive tumors despite the elevated expression of other notch signaling effectors and targets indicates that hes <dig> is not an ideal sole surrogate marker of notch signaling. further, these findings suggest that additional mechanisms beyond notch signaling may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of these tumors. studies to define the role of notch signaling in osas is warranted as inhibitors for this and other developmental pathways that impinge on hes <dig> are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of human cancers   <cit> . research in this area may reveal important regulatory mechanisms contributing to metastasis and therapeutic resistance in both canine and human osa. while we found that hes <dig> expression was not consistently linked to notch signaling in canine osa, our study has determined that reduced hes <dig> expression serves as an independent prognostic biomarker.
