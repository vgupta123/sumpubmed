BACKGROUND
bupivacaine is a sodium channel blocker administrated for local infiltration, nerve block, epidural, and intrathecal anesthesia
 <cit> . several clinical observations have suggested that the administration of bupivacaine in close proximity to nerves causes critical dysfunction, such as radiculopathy and paresthesia
 <cit> . an increasing number of studies have shown that bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity occurs through apoptosis, and it can be speculated that the administration of local anesthetics in clinical practice induces apoptotic cell death of neurons
 <cit> . however, the mechanisms by which bupivacaine triggers neurotoxicity have not been elucidated precisely.

reactive oxygen species  are known to stimulate a number of events and pathways that lead to apoptosis, including mitogen-activated protein kinase  signal transduction pathways
 <cit> . in neuronal cells, p <dig> mapk, a member of the mapk family, is preferentially activated by environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines, and it has been shown to promote neuronal cell death
 <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that bupivacaine-induced apoptosis involves generation of ros in schwann cells
 <cit>  and activation of p <dig> mapk in dorsal root ganglion  neurons
 <cit> . furthermore, a study using the human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cell line has shown that bupivacaine-induced apoptosis is associated with ros production and activation of p <dig> mapk
 <cit> .

the wd <dig> repeat, also known as the beta-transducin repeat or the wd, is a small structural motif of approximately  <dig> amino acids, typically bracketed by glycine-histidine and tryptophan-aspartate 
 <cit> . repeated wd <dig> motifs form a domain called the wd domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions. proteins with wd <dig> repeats have important roles in a variety of cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and intracellular signal transduction
 <cit> . wd repeat-containing protein  <dig>  is a novel member of this protein family
 <cit> . recently we reported that rat wdr <dig>  also referred to as naofen, activates caspase- <dig> and promotes tumor necrosis factor -α − induced apoptosis in hek <dig> cells
 <cit> . more recently, we reported that enhanced expression of wdr <dig> may mediate the activation of caspase- <dig> through a mitochondrial signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharide -induced hepatocyte apoptosis
 <cit> .

unami et al.
 <cit>  reported that both death receptor and mitochondrial signaling are involved in the process of bupivacaine-induced apoptosis in hl- <dig> cells. in contrast, a recent study showed that the local anesthetic lidocaine induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway independently of death receptor signaling
 <cit> . although bupivacaine has been reported to induce cell death and critical neuronal dysfunction, the precise mechanistic cascades of these effects remain unclear. the present study was undertaken to investigate whether bupivacaine induces apoptosis in the mouse neuroblastoma neuro2a cell line and to examine the potential involvement of wdr <dig>  ros, and p <dig> mapk in bupivacaine-induced neuro2a cell neurotoxicity.

RESULTS
bupivacaine induces ros generation and p <dig> mapk activation, resulting in apoptosis in neuro2a cells
as werdehausen et al. reported that  <dig> mm bupivacaine induces apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells
 <cit> , we first examined cell injury in  <dig> mm bupivacaine-treated neuro2a cells by measuring cell viability. bupivacaine significantly decreased cell viability of neuro2a cells in a time-dependent manner . treatment with  <dig> mm bupivacaine significantly activated caspase- <dig> from at time points from  <dig> to  <dig> h  and induced dna fragmentation in neuro2a cells . 

as shown in figure
1d, after treatment with  <dig> mm bupivacaine, intracellular ros levels in neuro2a increased significantly in a time-dependent manner at time points from  <dig>  to  <dig> h . to determine whether p <dig> mapk is activated in bupivacaine-treated neuro2a cells, protein levels of p <dig> and phospho-p <dig> were determined by western blotting and expressed as the phospho-p38/p <dig> ratio. bupivacaine-induced phospho-p <dig> protein expression significantly at time points from  <dig>  to  <dig> h ; the increase in phospho-p <dig> levels was not statistically significant at later time points . in addition, phospho-p <dig> protein expression was also significantly increased at time points from  <dig>  to  <dig> h when ros levels were induced in neuro2a cells by cellular exposure to h2o <dig> .

bupivacaine increases wdr <dig> expression in neuro2a cells
to determine whether wdr <dig> is upregulated in bupivacaine-treated neuro2a cells, the expression of wdr <dig> mrna and protein was analyzed by qpcr and western blotting, respectively. as shown in figure
2a, bupivacaine significantly increased wdr <dig> mrna expression in a dose-dependent manner, with  <dig> mm bupivacaine producing an  <dig> -fold increase in wdr <dig> mrna over the control level . treatment of neuro2a cells with  <dig> mm bupivacaine for  <dig> to  <dig> h significantly increased wdr <dig> mrna expression . the maximal effect was reached at  <dig> h, when there was an  <dig> -fold increase in wdr <dig> mrna over the control level. wdr <dig> protein expression was significantly increased in cells treated with bupivacaine for  <dig> h . in control experiments, treatment of neuro2a cells with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin did not alter wdr <dig> mrna expression , suggesting that the upregulation of wdr <dig> expression in bupivacaine-treated cells was not mediated by sodium channel blockade. 

in addition, h2o <dig> significantly increased wdr <dig> mrna expression in a dose-dependent manner . treatment of cells with  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> significantly increased wdr <dig> mrna expression in a time-dependent manner . expression of wdr <dig> protein was significantly increased at  <dig> h .

antioxidant euk- <dig> and p <dig> mapk inhibitor attenuate bupivacaine-induced cell death
euk- <dig>  a synthetic catalytic free radical scavenger, has protective effects in numerous models of disease processes associated with oxidative stress, including inflammation, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders
 <cit> . to determine whether ros generation and p <dig> mapk activation are involved in bupivacaine-induced apoptosis, the effects of euk- <dig> and sb <dig> on ros levels, caspase- <dig> activity and cell viability were measured. neuro2a cells were treated with euk- <dig>  and/or sb <dig>  for  <dig> h, followed by bupivacaine  for  <dig> h. euk- <dig> treatment significantly attenuated the bupivacaine-induced increase in intracellular ros levels , whereas sb <dig> treatment did not . as shown in figure
3b and c, both euk- <dig> treatment and sb <dig> treatment significantly attenuated the bupivacaine-induced increase in caspase- <dig> activity  and cell death . 

similarly, treatment with euk- <dig> significantly attenuated the h2o2-induced increase in intracellular ros levels , and both euk- <dig> treatment and sb <dig> treatment significantly attenuated the h2o2-induced increase in caspase- <dig> activity  and cell death . the combination of euk- <dig> and sb <dig> showed no apparent additive effects or synergism .

antioxidant euk- <dig> and p <dig> mapk inhibitor attenuate bupivacaine-induced increase in wdr <dig> expression
neuro2a cells were treated with euk- <dig> for  <dig> h, followed by bupivacaine  for  <dig> h. as shown in figure
4a and b, euk- <dig> significantly attenuated the bupivacaine-induced increase in expression of wdr <dig> mrna  and protein . 

in order to explore the relationship between wdr <dig> expression and p <dig> mapk activation, neuro2a cells were treated for  <dig> h with the p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> , followed by bupivacaine  for  <dig> h. as shown in figure
4c and d, sb <dig> significantly attenuated the bupivacaine-induced increase in expression of wdr <dig> mrna  and protein .

in addition, treatment with euk- <dig> and sb <dig> significantly attenuated the h2o2-induced increase in expression of wdr <dig> mrna  and protein . the combination of euk- <dig> and sb <dig> showed no apparent additive effects or synergism .

wdr <dig> sirna does not inhibit the increase in caspase- <dig> activity and cell death in neuro2a cells
finally, in order to examine the effects of wdr <dig> sirna in bupivacaine-treated neuro2a cells, cells were transfected with wdr <dig> sirna  for  <dig> h, then bupivacaine  or h2o <dig>  was added and the cells were incubated for another  <dig> h. although transfection of neuro2a cells with wdr <dig> sirna attenuated the bupivacaine- and h2o2-induced increase in expression of wdr <dig> mrna  and protein , it did not inhibit the increase in caspase- <dig> activity  or the increase in cell death . control-sirna had no effect on the expression of wdr <dig> mrna and protein and on caspase- <dig> activation in bupivacaine- or h2o2-treated neuro2a cells. 

discussion
in this study we showed that bupivacaine induced caspase- <dig> activation and dna fragmentation, indicating the occurrence of apoptosis, in neuro2a cells. the p <dig> mapk signaling pathway has been implicated in apoptosis occurring in response to distinct stimuli, such as ros
 <cit> . excessive production of ros can activate p <dig> mapk, eventually causing apoptosis
 <cit> . bupivacaine has previously been shown to increase intracellular ros levels in schwann cells
 <cit>  and sh-sy5y cells
 <cit> . in the present study, we examined whether bupivacaine induces ros in neuro2a cells. we found that bupivacaine significantly and time-dependently elevated intracellular ros levels in neuro2a cells. h2o <dig> also elevated ros levels in neuro2a cells. we then confirmed the activation of p <dig> mapk in cells treated with bupivacaine or h2o <dig>  our results are in agreement with recent reports that bupivacaine elicits ros production and induces apoptosis accompanied by activation of p <dig> mapk in other cell types
 <cit> . further, euk- <dig> significantly attenuated the bupivacaine-induced increase in intracellular ros levels, caspase- <dig> activity and cell death. in contrast, sb <dig> attenuated the bupivacaine-induced increase in caspase- <dig> activity and cell death, but had no effect on ros levels. effects on h2o2-induced increases in intracellular ros levels, caspase- <dig> activity and cell death were similar. these results indicate that bupivacaine-induced ros generation may be upstream of p <dig> mapk activation, leading to apoptosis in neuro2a cells.

the family of wd40-repeat proteins comprises a large number of proteins and is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis
 <cit> . wdr <dig> encodes a novel member of this protein family. in a mouse mutation screen for developmental phenotypes, mill et al.
 <cit>  identified a mutation in the wdr <dig> gene as a cause of midgestation lethality associated with abnormalities characteristic of defects in the hedgehog signaling pathway. more recently, clinical studies have identified relationships between the wdr <dig> gene and coronary artery disease
 <cit>  and sensenbrenner syndrome
 <cit> . on the cellular level, we reported that wdr <dig> sirna inhibited both tnf-α − induced caspase- <dig> activation and apoptosis in hek <dig> cells
 <cit> . more recently, we reported that wdr <dig> elicits an inhibitory effect on the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl in hepatocytes treated with lps, causing release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of caspase- <dig>  resulting in lps-induced hepatocyte apoptosis
 <cit> . these results indicate that wdr <dig> is involved in apoptosis mediated by caspase- <dig> activation via both the death receptor and mitochondrial signaling pathways.

in order to determine whether wdr <dig> is involved in bupivacaine-induced apoptosis, we examined the expression of wdr <dig> in bupivacaine-treated neuro2a cells. in the present study, we showed that wdr <dig> expression significantly increased with respect to both mrna and protein levels. these results are consistent with our previous reports of enhanced expression of wdr <dig> in the kidneys of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats
 <cit>  and in the livers of lps-treated rats
 <cit> . further, we examined the effects of euk- <dig> and sb <dig> on wdr <dig> expression in bupivacaine-treated neuro2a cells. these compounds significantly attenuated the bupivacaine-induced increase in wdr <dig> expression. collectively, we provided the first evidence that bupivacaine-induced wdr <dig> expression may be downstream of ros generation and subsequent p <dig> mapk activation.

in our previous studies, wdr <dig> sirna inhibited increases in caspase- <dig> activity in hek <dig> cells induced by tnf-α
 <cit> , in hepatocytes induced by lps
 <cit> , and in nrk52e cells induced by high glucose
 <cit> . interestingly, we found that blocking upregulation of wdr <dig> expression with wdr <dig> sirna in neuro2a cells had no effect on the increase in caspase- <dig> activity or the increase in cell death induced by bupivacaine. the lack of wdr <dig> involvement in caspase- <dig> activation in bupivacaine-induced apoptosis in neuro2a cells was unexpected. it is difficult to clearly explore the discrepancy in results between the previous studies and the present study because available information relating to physiological role of wdr <dig> is very limited. nevertheless, our findings may paradoxically suggest the existence of another mechanism of bupivacaine-induced apoptosis independent from wdr <dig> expression in neuro2a cells. in fact, several lines of evidence indicated that bupivacaine-induced apoptosis has multiple mechanisms with depending on the types of cell. bupivacaine induces neurotoxicity through activation of the amp-activated protein kinase -dependent pathway in schwann cells
 <cit>  and sh-sy5y cells
 <cit> , and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase -dependent pathway in neuro2a cells
 <cit> . these findings raise an interesting possibility that some, if not all, of these pathways could modulate bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity independently or collaboratively. we will perform further studies using caspase- <dig> inhibitors, other cell types and other apoptotic stimuli to investigate the sequence of events.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results indicate that bupivacaine induces apoptosis in neuro2a cells. bupivacaine induces ros generation and p <dig> mapk activation, resulting in an increase in wdr <dig> expression. however, the increase in wdr <dig> expression doesn’t seem to be involved in bupivacaine-induced apoptosis in neuro2a cells. these results may suggest the existence of another mechanism of bupivacaine-induced apoptosis independent from wdr <dig> expression in neuro2a cells.
