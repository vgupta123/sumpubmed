BACKGROUND
the family camelidae has two old world  species, bactrian camel  and dromedary , and four new world  species, guanaco , llama , alpaca  and vicuna  at present time  <cit> . the wild bactrian camel  appears to be the only wild survivor of the old world camel. according to the fossil record, camelidae evolved in north america during the eocene, approximately 40– <dig> million years ago  <cit> , and the division between camelini and lamini occurred in north america about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . in the late tertiary  the species of camelini and lamini migrated from north america to south america and asia separately, and their ancestors became extinct in north america subsequently. however, there have been very few molecular studies due to difficulties in either obtaining enough dna samples or acquiring enough sequence information. previous molecular studies, mainly focusing on the sequence of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, have made significant contributions to understanding the evolutionary history of camelidae  <cit> , and yet there has not been any significant comparative studies on the evolutionary relationship between camelini and lamini.

mitochondrial dna  has been proven useful for studying evolutionary relationships among animal species, due to its conservativeness in protein-coding sequences, high substitution rate in its non-coding sequences, and lack of genetic recombination  <cit> . to investigate the evolutionary relationship between camelini and lamini, we have made an unprecedented effort to obtain adequate samples from the wild two-humped camel, sequenced its mitochondrial genome completely, and carried out detailed sequence and evolutionary analyses.

RESULTS
genome organization
since mammalian mitochondrial genome sequences are very similar, we designed a set of pcr primers based on highly conserved sequences of an alignment with full-length mitochondrial genomes from the available public data, including those of cow, deer, sheep, pig, and lama . we sequenced some of the pcr-amplified dna segments first to obtain as much authentic sequences as possible from the wild two-humped camel, and subsequently designed new primers according to the newly acquired sequences. we collected  <dig> raw sequence traces with an average length of  <dig> bp at a quality value of q <dig>  which cover the entire genome four folds.

athe numbers refer to the position of pcr primers  in mitochondrial genes.

the full-length mitochondrial genome is  <dig>  bp in length , which is  <dig> bp longer than that of l. pacos. the minor length variation mainly occurred in the tandem repeat n of the control region. the gene order and content are identical to those of other mammals ; it harbors  <dig> protein-coding genes , the small and large ribosomal rna genes, and  <dig> trna genes . the replication origin of the light strand within a trna gene cluster was also unambiguously identified.

h and l refer to heavy and light strains of the mitochondrial genome, respectively.

protein-coding genes
we carefully annotated  <dig> protein-coding genes , including start and stop codons . three of them, cox <dig> nd <dig>  and nd <dig>  do not have normal stop codons but have the cryptic components, t, ta, and t, respectively. the possession of such noncanonical start and stop codons is shared by most of the vertebrate mitochondrial genomes. these t or ta stop codon components are supplemented via posttranscriptional polyadenylation later in the cellular translation process  <cit> . another common feature among vertebrate mitochondrial genomes is the existence of overlapping genes; for instance, atp <dig> and atp <dig> share a 42-bp sequence.

the mitochondrial genome of the wild camel shares its genetic code with other vertebrates . in this mtdna, the codon cta for leucine is the most frequently used  and the codon cgt for arginine is the least frequently found  even though both amino acids are separately encoded by six and four codons in the canonical genetic code. the codons ending with a or t are used more frequently than those ending with g or c since it has a high a+t  content similar to what have been found among other mammals.

a the one-letter code for amino acids  was used;

b the most frequently used codon;

c the least frequently used codon.

transfer rna genes
we identified  <dig> trna genes in mtdna of the wild camel;  <dig> of them were predicted capable of folding into the cloverleaf structure and possess anticodons that match the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code . only one of them, trnaser lacks the appropriate sequence elements for forming an orthodox cloverleaf structure as well as both dihydrouridine loop and the anticodon . although it has been predicted that this trnaser gene  may be a pseudogene as observed among other metazoan mitochondrial genomes and some of them were proven inactive  <cit> , efforts have been made to uncover underlying molecular details as to how serine residues are actually added into peptide chains with this "bizarre" trna  <cit> .

non-coding sequences
among vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, most of the non-coding sequences are part of the control region, about 700– <dig>  bp in length, responsible for the regulation of replication and transcription  <cit> . the control region shows extensive variability across taxonomic groups and even among related species, but its sequence elements related to regulatory functions are known to be highly conserved. we annotated the  <dig> -bp control region and regulatory domains; at the 5' end, we found termination-associated sequence  motifs that act as a signal for terminating synthesis of the d-loop strand  <cit> . the sequence between bactrian camel and alpaca showed less similarity as expected . we also discovered all eight putative conserved sequence blocks  that are important to the regulation of mtdna replication  <cit> ; among them, csb <dig> and csbc-f are conserved among mammals, whereas csb <dig> and csb <dig> are absent from some of them.

mitochondrial dna variations in camelidae
to investigate mitochondrial dna variations in camelidae, we compared the two complete sequences from the wild camel and alpaca; the comparison yielded  <dig>  transitions and  <dig> transversions when excluding the highly variable control region. we also identified  <dig> single nucleotide indels  from non-coding rna sequences. the most striking observation was a codon indel  encodes proline residue found in the nd <dig> gene between c. bactrianus ferus and l. pacos. this indel, upon further scrutiny, is actually an insertion in the l. pacos mtdna but absolutely absent in the rest of mammalian mtdna collection. in other words, it is lineage-specific to the new world l. pacos, suggesting that an insertion event occurred after the old and new world camelidae split. furthermore, our comparative analyses showed a relatively lower ratio of nonsynonymous substitution  to synonymous substitution  in cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig>  and cytb genes , whereas a large number of nonsynonymous substitutions were observed in nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd4l, and atp <dig> gene sequences, especially in the atp <dig> gene. this result indicates that the nd family and atp synthase genes may evolve faster than other genes among the  <dig> protein-coding ones. this pattern is not universal among all mammalian mitochondrial genomes and suggests its functional relevance for mitochondrial biology. to our surprise, the nd <dig> gene that harbors the codon insertion in l. pacos does not appear to have higher mutation rate as compared to other nd family genes in its mtdna.

phylogenetic analyses
to date the divergence time between camelini and lamini, we aligned complete mtdna sequences of the wild camel and alpaca as well as other selected mammals. we then constructed a phylogenetic tree from these aligned sequences by using those of rat and mouse as outgroup . since the control region of mtdna has a high incidence of homoplasy  <cit> , we excluded it for this analysis. similar topology was obtained with both neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. bootstrap values and bayesian posterior probabilities were showed for all clades.

estimating divergence time can be done with or without assuming a constant rate evolutionary rate among all compared clades. since evolutionary rate of camelidae mitochondrial genomes has not been well-studied, we tested the rate constancy in camelidae using mtdna excluding the control region. we first performed tajima's relative rate test, using cow as an outgroup. molecular clock analyses are highly sensitive to evolutionary distance between main clades and the choice of an outgroup is of importance  <cit> . the result rejected the assumption of a constant rate of change among the camelid mitochondrial genomes . to further confirm this conclusion, we used likelihood ratio method for a similar test , and showed obvious differences in the evolutionary rate between the two tribes .

since these studies pointed out that the assumption of rate constancy might not be appropriate for estimating divergence time between camelini and lamini, we used a heuristic rate smoothing procedure for ml-based estimates  <cit> , which takes into account evolutionary rates among different branches of the tree. we used two calibration points,  <dig> and  <dig> million years, which were the estimated timing for the divergence of cow-pig  and mouse-rat , respectively  <cit> . average rates for the wild camel and alpaca were  <dig> % per million years and  <dig> % per million years, respectively. therefore, the divergence time between camelini and lamini was estimated to be  <dig> million years, significantly earlier than what was estimated based on fossil records . this result suggested that the divergence of the two tribes might occur in the early miocene  <cit> .

we also constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the cytb gene sequences from the wild camel and other camelids, and looked into other possibilities . similarly, we used the two calibration points,  <dig> and  <dig> million years, and performed a maximum likelihood procedure to estimate divergence time. in tribe camelini, the divergence time of bactrian camel and dromedary was estimated as  <dig> million years, whereas in tribe lamini, alpaca diverged from the other three species about  <dig> million years ago. guanaco and llama diverged from their common ancestor in the early pleistocene,  <dig>  million years ago.

discussion
although the mitochondrial genome of the wild two-humped camel is highly similar to those of other mammals, there are substantial differences in the mtdna evolutionary rate for different taxonomic groups. relative rate tests demonstrated the evolutionary rate also varies between bactrian camel and other mammals . the difference within a taxonomic group is as significant as among groups. for example, the rate for bactrian camel is significantly different from that for alpaca, so does the rate between bactrian camel and cow.

the divergence time for camelini and lamini was estimated to be  <dig> million years or in the early miocene. this estimate is significantly earlier than what were suggested based on the fossil record in north america  <cit> . in tribe camelini, we estimated that speciation of bactrian camel and dromedary may have begun  <dig> million years ago. if the time of the camel migrating from north america to asia estimated based on the fossil material is correct   <cit> , the speciation of the genus camelus may have occurred in north america. in tribe lamini, alpaca is an older lineage that evolved to become the current species about  <dig> million years ago. in contrast, guanaco and llama diverged from their common ancestor much later, about  <dig>  million years ago in the early pleistocene; this divergence occurred after lamini species migrated from north america to south america  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the mtdna of c. bactrianus ferus is very similar to that of other mammals. it contains  <dig> protein-coding, two rrna, and  <dig> trna genes as well as a typical control region. molecular clock analyses on complete mitochondrial genomes from c. bactrianus ferus and lama pacos suggested that the two tribes diverged from their common ancestor about  <dig> million years ago, much earlier than what were suggested based on fossil record. the evolutionary history of camelidae, reconstructed by using cytb sequences, suggested that the speciation of bactrian camel and dromedary may have occurred in north america before they migrated to south america and subsequently left the continent.
