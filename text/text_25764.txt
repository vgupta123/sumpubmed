BACKGROUND
five subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors that belong to class a of g-protein coupled receptors have been identified  <cit> . the primary response of stimulation of the m <dig> and m <dig> subtypes of muscarinic receptors is activation of the gi/o class of g-proteins resulting in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, whereas stimulation of m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> receptors leads to activation of the gq/ <dig> class of g-proteins and stimulation of phospholipase c <cit> . muscarinic receptors mediate many diverse physiological functions that are selectively mediated by different receptor subtypes  <cit> . this is why discovery of selective ligands is of prime importance for clinical practice. however, due to the very conserved nature of the orthosteric binding site of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors the selectivity of orthosteric agonists is very poor  <cit> . orthosteric antagonists that bind to less conserved amino acids located close to the orthosteric binding site display better selectivity than orthosteric agonists. muscarinic allosteric ligands exhibit remarkable selectivity among receptor subtypes  <cit> . they interact mainly with the second and the third extracellular loops that are much less conserved than transmembrane segments creating the orthosteric binding site  <cit> .

the extraordinary selectivity of allosteric modulators that is due to differences in both affinity and cooperativity  <cit>  has attracted attention of pharmacologists in the past decade. somewhat paradoxically, most of originally discovered and probably best studied allosteric compounds of muscarinic receptors are neuromuscular blockers  <cit> . by definition, these are competitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists but many of them have high affinities and strong allosteric interactions, particularly at the m <dig> subtype of muscarinic receptors.

in clinical practice, different competitive  neuromuscular blockers are employed to induce muscle relaxation to facilitate intubation during surgery. the neuromuscular blocker rapacuronium was withdrawn from clinical use due to high incidence of bronchospasm resulting in death  <cit> . parasympathetic innervation of airways transmits signal via postsynaptic m <dig> receptors that mediate acetylcholine-induced contraction and m <dig> receptors that inhibit with high potency smooth muscle relaxation mediated by increase in cytoplasmic camp  <cit> . m <dig> receptors are also located at parasympathetic cholinergic nerve terminals innervating smooth muscle and their stimulation inhibits acetylcholine  release  <cit> . in functional experiments on the guinea pig trachea preparation it was demonstrated that rapacuronium preferentially antagonizes m <dig> over m <dig> muscarinic receptors  <cit> . in addition, involvement of allosteric potentiation of ach binding to muscarinic m <dig> receptors in bronchospasm induced by rapacuronium was suggested, but not proven  <cit> . a very recent paper confirmed a unique behavior of rapacuronium compared to other skeletal muscle relaxants in vivo and demonstrated that rapacuronium potentiates bronchoconstriction evoked by both naturally released and exogenous acetylcholine, indicating an important role of postsynaptic m <dig> receptors  <cit> .

because we have been interested in investigations of positive cooperativity of allosteric ligands with ach binding  <cit>  and allosteric agonists  <cit>  these findings led us to analyze in detail the interactions of rapacuronium with acetylcholine binding and receptor activation of all subtypes of muscarinic receptors heterologously expressed in membranes of chinese hamster ovary  cells. we demonstrate that rapacuronium binds to and exhibits negative cooperativity with ach binding at all subtypes of muscarinic receptors. surprisingly, low concentrations of rapacuronium potentiate ach-induced signaling at the m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> receptor subtypes and accelerate ach binding. this striking behavior is unparallel at other neuromuscular blockers.

RESULTS
saturation binding experiments  with  <dig> pm to  <dig> nm nms in cell membranes showed similar binding capacity  and affinity  ranging from  <dig> pm at m <dig> to  <dig> pm at m <dig> receptors) for all receptor subtypes . significant depletion  occurred despite the use of  <dig>  ml incubation volume in the binding assays. thus, free concentrations of nms were calculated and used in eq.  <dig>  saturation binding experiments with  <dig>  nm to  <dig> nm ach showed similar high affinity binding among all subtypes with kd around  <dig> nm. rapacuronium concentration dependently decreased affinity for nms and ach at all subtypes without change in maximum binding capacity . competition experiments of unlabeled ach vs. nms displayed high and low binding sites for ach at all subtypes with higher proportion of high affinity binding sites at even-numbered subtypes . equilibrium dissociation constants  of ach high-affinity binding derived from competition experiments with nms  correspond to those measured in ach saturation experiments . in the presence of  <dig> μm gtpγs to uncouple receptors and g-proteins ach low affinity binding was similar at all five subtypes with equilibrium dissociation constant  ranging from  <dig>  μm at m <dig> to  <dig>  μm at m <dig> 

negative logarithms of equilibrium dissociation constants  and maximum binding capacities  of radioligands were obtained from saturation experiments shown in figure  <dig> by fitting eq.  <dig> to the data. values are means ± se of fits to  <dig> independent experiments performed in quadruplicates.

effects of  <dig> μm rapacuronium on the rate of  dissociation were measured in membranes from cho cell expressing individual subtypes of muscarinic receptors after  <dig> min preincubation with  <dig> nm nms. dissociation was evoked by addition of  <dig> μm unlabeled nms. rapacuronium slowed dissociation of nms from all subtypes of muscarinic ach receptors . this is an established hallmark of allosteric receptor modulation. it had the strongest effect at m <dig> receptors  and weakest effect at m <dig> and m <dig> receptors . while dissociation evoked by nms was monophasic  it became biphasic in the presence of  <dig> μm rapacuronium with the exception of the m <dig> subtype.

observed rates of nms dissociation  and fraction of sites  with faster dissociation  from individual subtypes of muscarinic receptors were obtained by fitting eq. 7a and 7b to data in figure  <dig>  results of better fit are shown. values are means ± se of fits to  <dig> independent experiments performed in quadruplicates. *p <  <dig> ; significantly different from control  by t-test

displacement radioligand binding experiments with either  <dig> nm ach  or  <dig> nm nms  and increasing concentrations of rapacuronium showed that rapacuronium binds equally well to all five muscarinic receptor subtypes. equilibrium dissociation constants  for rapacuronium derived from experiments with nms and ach were virtually the same with a rank order of affinity of m2>m4>m1>m5>m <dig> . rapacuronium displayed negative cooperativity with nms in binding to all subtypes, as evidenced by a maximal limit to its effects on the affinity of the radioligand that differed as a function of radioligand concentration. these effects were strongest at the m <dig> subtype  and weakest at the m <dig> subtype . while cooperativity of rapacuronium with high-  and low-affinity  ach binding was essentially the same at individual subtypes  it was slightly different among subtypes .

negative logarithm of equilibrium dissociation constant of rapacuronium  and factor of cooperativity  between rapacuronium and radioligand  binding were obtained by fitting eq.  <dig> to the data in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  negative logarithm of equilibrium dissociation constant of rapacuronium  and factors of cooperativity  between rapacuronium and acetylcholine low affinity binding were obtained by fitting eq.  <dig> to the data in figure  <dig>  factors of cooperativity α and β are expressed as negative logarithms so that negative values represent negative cooperativity. values are means ± se of fits to  <dig> independent experiments performed in quadruplicates.

rapacuronium alone concentration dependently lowered gtpγs binding to membranes  with a maximal effect of approximately 25% at odd-numbered subtypes and 15% at even-numbered subtypes, with similar half-effective concentrations  ranging from  <dig> μm at m <dig> receptors to  <dig> μm at m <dig> receptors. while the ec <dig> values of rapacuronium in inhibiting gtpγs binding at individual subtypes correlated with affinities measured in binding experiments with ach  they were lower  at all subtypes. we could not test the involvement of muscarinic receptors in the effects of rapacuronium on gtpγs binding using orthosteric antagonists, since  <dig> μm nms or  <dig> μm atropine by themselves decreased gtpγs binding by more than 30% at all receptor subtypes. inhibitory effects of rapacuronium were not additive to those of nms or atropine . however, rapacuronium did not decrease gtpγs binding in membranes from nontransfected cho cells .

negative logarithms of half effective concentrations  and emax of rapacuronium on gtpγs binding were obtained by fitting eq.  <dig> to the data from the measurements of gtpγs binding in the presence of rapacuronium in concentrations ranging from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m normalized to the absence of rapacuronium . values are means ± se of fits to  <dig> independent experiments performed in quadruplicates.

as expected, ach concentration-dependently stimulated gtpγs binding to membranes from cells expressing all individual subtypes of muscarinic receptors . the maximal effect of ach  was about two-fold increase in basal binding at odd-numbered receptors and three-fold increase at even-numbered receptors with a rank order of efficacy of m2>m4>m1>m5>m <dig> . in control conditions ach ec <dig> values were lower at even-numbered subtypes than at odd-numbered subtypes with a rank order of potency of m2>m4>m3>m5>m <dig>  . while the ec <dig> of ach-stimulated gtpγs binding was less than that of its low-affinity binding conformation by 178-times at m <dig> and 23-times at m <dig> receptors it was only  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -times lower at m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> receptors, respectively. in comparison with its high-affinity binding, the ec <dig> of ach-stimulated gtpγs binding was only 10-times higher at m <dig> and 55-times at m <dig> receptors but 130-260- and 300-times higher at m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> receptors, respectively. emax was about two-fold increase in basal binding at odd-numbered receptors and three-fold increase at even-numbered receptors with a rank order of efficacy of m2>m4>m1>m5>m <dig>  .

negative logarithms of half effective concentrations  and maximum stimulatory effect  of acetylcholine on gtpγs binding in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of rapacuronium were obtained by fitting eq.  <dig> to the data in figure  <dig>  values are means ± se of fits to  <dig> independent experiments performed in quadruplicates. *p <  <dig> ; significantly different from control  by anova and tukey-kramer post-test.

measurements of ach-stimulated gtpγs binding in the presence of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> μm rapacuronium showed differential effects of rapacuronium on receptor activation by an orthosteric agonist at individual receptor subtypes . at even-numbered subtypes  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm rapacuronium significantly increased ach ec <dig>  with lowering of emax at  <dig> μm rapacuronium. these results are in line with the effects of rapacuronium on ach binding. in contrast, the effects of rapacuronium on activation of odd-numbered subtypes were more complex. at these subtypes rapacuronium had the strongest effect on activation of the m <dig> subtype. at this subtype  <dig>  and  <dig> μm rapacuronium caused a significant 2-fold decrease in ach ec <dig> and approximately 60% and 35% increase in emax, respectively. rapacuronium at  <dig> μm increased ach ec <dig> by about 3-fold without a significant change in emax. rapacuronium  had no effect on ach efficacy at the m <dig> and m <dig> subtypes but decreased the ec <dig> of ach in stimulating gtpγs binding by  <dig> - and 4-fold, respectively, at concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig> μm. however, this effect was not evident at  <dig> μm rapacuronium .

kinetics of gtpγs binding to membranes from cho-m <dig> cells  were measured after  <dig> min preincubation with  <dig> μm gdp and  <dig> min with  <dig> μm rapacuronium followed by simultaneous addition of gtpγs and ach, with or without rapacuronium . under basal conditions  gtpγs bound to membranes with an observed rate constant  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min- <dig>  ten μm ach accelerated the rate of gtpγs binding to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min- <dig>  and  <dig> μm rapacuronium further increased the rate to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min- <dig> . while  <dig> μm ach alone produced only 2-fold increase in gtpγs binding at  <dig> min incubation it caused nearly 5-fold increase in the presence of  <dig> μm rapacuronium. estimated gtpγs equilibrium binding  was the same for all  <dig> treatments . rapacuronium alone slightly decreased the rate of gtpγs binding .

effects of rapacuronium on the association rate of high-affinity  ach binding were measured after  <dig> min preincubation of membranes with rapacuronium. association of ach is complex and consists of an initial very fast step in the range of seconds followed by a slower phase . under control conditions  the slower phase of ach association was characterized by an observed rate  in the range of  <dig>   to  <dig>   min- <dig>  while the presence of  <dig> μm rapacuronium had marginal effects on ach association  the association binding curve became more complex and showed a peak in the presence of  <dig> μm rapacuronium . this peak occurred at  <dig> to  <dig> seconds at odd-numbered receptors and at  <dig> to  <dig> seconds at the m <dig> and around  <dig> seconds at the m <dig> receptor. peak binding was higher than control binding at odd-numbered receptors, the same as control binding at m <dig> and lower than control binding at m <dig> receptor. an increase in ach binding after extended incubation  occurred at m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> receptors.

effects of  <dig> μm rapacuronium on the dissociation rate of high-affinity ach binding were measured after  <dig> min preincubation of membranes with  <dig> nm ach. dissociation was evoked by the addition of unlabeled ach at a final concentration of  <dig> μm, either alone or mixed with  <dig> μm rapacuronium . ach dissociation curves consisted of a very rapid phase followed by a slow one, both in the absence  and in the presence  of rapacuronium. the slower phase of ach dissociation displayed a rate  in the range of  <dig>   to  <dig>   min- <dig> . while effects of  <dig> μm rapacuronium on ach dissociation were marginal,  <dig> μm rapacuronium either accelerated , did not change  or slowed  the rate of ach dissociation .

observed rates of association  of  <dig> nm ach with and dissociation  from individual subtypes of muscarinic receptors were obtained by fitting eq.  <dig> to data in figure  <dig> and eq. 7c to data in figure  <dig>  values are means ± se of fits to  <dig> independent experiments performed in quadruplicates. *p <  <dig> ; significantly different from control  by t-test.

the effects of rapacuronium and the two prototypic allosteric modulators alcuronium and gallamine on ach-stimulated gtpγs binding and kinetics of ach binding were compared at m <dig> receptors where the effects of rapacuronium were most pronounced. measurements of ach-stimulated gtpγs binding in the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> μm alcuronium or  <dig> and  <dig> μm gallamine, showed a small concentration-dependent increase in the ec <dig> of ach without change in emax values . both alcuronium and gallamine concentration dependently slowed gtpγs association stimulated by  <dig> μm ach. at  <dig> μm concentrations they also decreased gtpγs equilibrium binding . alcuronium and gallamine slowed down association of  <dig> nm ach and decreased its equilibrium binding at m <dig> receptors .

values of observed rates of association  and equilibrium binding  of  <dig> nm ach with m <dig> receptors were obtained by fitting eq.  <dig> to data in figure  <dig> . values of kobs and beq of  <dig> pm gtpγs with m <dig> receptors were obtained by fitting eq.  <dig> to data in figure  <dig> . negative logarithms of half effective concentrations  and maximum stimulatory effect  of acetylcholine on gtpγs binding in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of alcuronium or gallamine were obtained by fitting eq.  <dig> to the data in figure  <dig> . values are means ± se of fits to  <dig> to  <dig> independent experiments performed in quadruplicates. *p <  <dig> ; significantly different from control  by anova and tukey-kramer post-test.

discussion
our results clearly demonstrate that the neuromuscular blocker rapacuronium binds to all muscarinic receptor subtypes at physiologically relevant concentrations  <cit>  and displays micromolar affinity and slight selectivity towards m <dig> receptor. this selectivity is smaller than that of other neuromuscular blockers such as alcuronium, gallamine and pancuronium . like the majority of this class of compounds, rapacuronium acts as a negative allosteric modulator  with respect to binding of both the natural agonist ach  and the classical antagonist nms . rapacuronium exhibits complex effects on the kinetics of ach binding  and subsequent receptor activation estimated from stimulation of gtpγs binding . functional effects differ from those of the prototypic negative allosteric modulators alcuronium and gallamine .

our observation of an allosteric mode of interaction between rapacuronium and muscarinic receptors is in agreement with reported slowing-down of nms dissociation from m <dig> and m <dig> receptors by this drug  <cit> . the observed biphasic dissociation of nms under non-equilibrium conditions in the presence of an allosteric modulator such as rapacuronium was described earlier  <cit> .

inverse receptor agonism by rapacuronium
rapacuronium alone decreases gtpγs binding. this effect is mediated by muscarinic receptors because it is not observed in membranes prepared from a native cho cell line that does not express muscarinic receptors and thus cannot be explained by nonspecific effects on cell membranes. instead, this effect can be related to an inverse agonistic effect of rapacuronium itself on constitutive receptor activity. this view is supported by previous demonstration of constitutive activity of muscarinic receptors  <cit>  and by finding that the orthosteric antagonists nms and atropine also decrease gtpγs binding when applied alone  <cit> . in addition, both agonistic and inverse agonistic effects of allosteric modulators have already been observed  <cit> .

allosteric modulation of receptor activation by rapacuronium
both ach saturation binding experiments  and ach vs. nms competition experiments  show ach high affinity binding in the nanomolar range without selectivity towards any of muscarinic receptor subtypes. the affinities of ach at m <dig> and m <dig> receptors reported in this study are within the range of published values, being lower than those published by lazareno et al.  <cit>  but higher than the values reported by haga et al.  <cit>  or gurwitz et al.  <cit> . this divergence is likely due to the dependence of the affinity of acetylcholine at its high-affinity site on many factors , residual concentration of gdp, temperature, etc.). similarly, we found no subtype differences in ach low affinity binding, which is in accordance with our previous studies  <cit> . despite lack of binding selectivity, the potency and efficacy of ach in stimulating gtpγs binding are significantly higher at even-numbered than at odd-numbered subtypes. in other words, the m <dig> and m <dig> subtypes that preferentially couple with gi/o g-proteins display better coupling and larger receptor reserve than the m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> subtypes that preferentially couple with gq/ <dig> g-proteins. despite accumulating evidence for the existence of agonist-specific conformations of muscarinic and other g-protein-coupled receptors  <cit>  it is generally accepted that the change in agonist potency in receptor activation follows a change in the affinity of its binding induced by an allosteric modulator. thus, negative cooperativity between the allosteric modulator and the binding of an orthosteric agonist would lead to lower potency of agonist  and positive cooperativity would result in higher potency of agonist  <cit> . rapacuronium behaves in accordance with this view in case of the m <dig> and m <dig> subtypes. however, at the m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> receptor subtypes, rapacuronium up to a concentration of  <dig> μm either increases or does not alter ach potency or efficacy in inducing gtpγs binding , despite clear negative cooperativity with ach binding . although this observation may appear surprising at first glance it is perfectly in agreement with the hypothesis of multiple receptor conformations induced by orthosteric and allosteric ligands, and with the existence of conformations that exhibit low affinity for agonist binding but nevertheless activate second messenger pathways  <cit> .

kinetics of functional response
analysis of the kinetics of gtpγs binding shows that the facilitatory effects of rapacuronium on ach-induced responses are evident after brief incubations . this suggests that the facilitating effects of rapacuronium on ach-induced response are a consequence of altered receptor kinetics rather than a change in agonist affinity at equilibrium. extended time of incubation during which binding of ligands equilibrates may thus obscure the initial transient potentiation. analysis of kinetics of ach binding  showed that rapacuronium affects ach kinetics differently than those of nms. while rapacuronium slows down nms association and dissociation at all receptor subtypes  it accelerates ach association and dissociation at odd-numbered subtypes . thus, rapacuronium doubles the magnitude of ach binding at  <dig> seconds at these receptors such that association after  <dig> seconds is twice as much in the presence of rapacuronium. this effect, however, is counterbalanced by accelerated dissociation, resulting in an overall decrease in ach affinity . although combination of negative binding cooperativity on the one hand and acceleration of binding on the other could in principle be interpreted within the frame of the ternary receptor model. however, data of association and dissociation of ach in the absence of rapacuronium do not conform to a simple bi-molecular interaction. as a result, the interaction between ach and rapacuronium at muscarinic receptors is more complex and may involve allosteric extension of the tandem two-site model  <cit> . theoretically, this extension of the model allows for coexistence of positive cooperativity between rapacuronium and the initial step of ach binding and overall negative binding cooperativity under equilibrium. an enigmatic feature of our data, however, is that low concentrations of rapacuronium  that do not affect the the rate of binding of ach or its affinity at equilibrium at odd numbered subtypes leads to an increase in both potency and efficacy of ach in receptor activation. theoreticaly, allosteric extension of tandem two-site model allows for positive cooperativity between rapacuronium and ach initial binding step in overall negative binding cooperativity under equilibrium and transient binding of these sub-threshold concentrations. however, these concentrations of rapacuronium had no effect on ach association in binding experiments . one possible explanation is that ach bound to a peripheral site  is lost during filtration but is well reflected and amplified in gtpγs binding that is pseudo-irreversible. a more speculative explanation assumes that rapacuronium at sub-micromolar concentrations binds to another site on the receptor and facilitates receptor activation by ach without significant interference with radioligand binding. this facilitatory effect is overcome at high concentrations of rapacuronium by negative cooperativity in binding of ach induced by binding of rapacuronium to an allosteric binding site. a latent further increase in ach binding after  <dig> min in the presence of  <dig> μm rapacuronium  suggests an even more complex mechanism of interaction of rapacuronium wih the receptor.

modeling of such complex kinetics would require a model even more sophisticated than ternary extension of the tandem-two site model  <cit> . additionally, differential effects of low concentrations of rapacuronium  on receptor binding and function would require inclusion of receptor activation  in the model and therefore renders modeling unachievable.

comparison of the effects of rapacuronium with those of the prototypic allosteric modulators alcuronium and gallamine  on m <dig> receptors shows that acceleration of ach kinetics is unique to rapacuronium among negative allosteric modulators. to our knowledge this is the first report of acceleration of binding of an orthosteric ligand by a negative allosteric modulator. this highlights unpredictability of kinetics of allosteric modulation based on compounds with similar behavior observed under equilibrium.

physiological implications
our observations are consistent with functional ex vivo and in vivo physiological experiments demonstrating an increase of acetylcholine-evoked muscle contraction of guinea pig trachea rings by rapacuronium  <cit> . although they confirm proposed allostetic interaction between rapacuronium and ach  <cit>  they do not conform to the proposed positive binding cooperativity at the m <dig> receptor subtype. although rapacuronium at concentrations below  <dig> μm binds to and decreases the affinity of acetylcholine at equilibrium at all subtypes of muscarinic receptors, it accelerates association of ach and enhances its potency and efficacy in functional responses at the m <dig> receptor as evident from gtpγs binding. the initial acceleration of the rate of association of ach would potentiate fast responses such as bronchial smooth muscle contractions mediated by transient actions of acetylcholine at m <dig> receptors  <cit> . in contrast, rapacuronium at clinically relevant concentrations strongly reduces the affinity of binding of ach and also its potency and efficacy in activating m <dig> receptors. this pattern of effects should lead to an increase in ach release by interrupting its m <dig> receptor-mediated presynaptic autoinhibition  <cit>  and to the inhibition of postsynaptic m <dig> receptor-mediated muscle relaxation. in contrast, the decrease of ach affinity at the m <dig> and m <dig> subtypes is accompanied by a decrease in both potency and efficacy of stimulating gtpγs binding. the synergistic effects of negative functional modulation of pre- and postsynaptic m <dig> receptors and positive functional modulation of postsynaptic m <dig> receptors can explain the fatal bronchospasm caused by rapacuronium in human.

CONCLUSIONS
although rapacuronium exerts negative cooperativity with binding of ach to all muscarinic receptor subtypes at equilibrium it accelerates the rate of ach binding at odd numbered subtypes. at concentrations below  <dig> μm, it increases the potency and efficacy of ach in increasing the rate of gtpγs binding at odd-numbered subtypes. the time between acetylcholine release and termination of its action by acetylcholinesterase is in the range of a fraction of a second. therefore, the effects of allosteric modulators in the early non-equilibrium stage of receptor signaling are therapeutically more important than effects on acetylcholine equilibrium binding, as the latter conditions do not occur in vivo. our study demonstrates a case of dichotomous effects of the allosteric modulator rapacuronium on ach equilibrium binding on the one hand and on the kinetics of ach binding on the other. our observations emphasize the necessity to employ fast functional assays in screening for potential allosteric modulators of neurotransmission that much better simulate physiological conditions than long-lasting equilibrium binding experiments.
