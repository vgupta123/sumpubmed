BACKGROUND
rahnella, a genus of the enterobacteriaceae, is commonly found in the rhizosphere  <cit>  and phyllosphere  <cit> , seeds  <cit> , fruits  <cit> , water  <cit>  and intestinal tracts of herbivores including snails, slugs, and even american mastodon remains  <cit> . in addition, rahnella strains have been isolated from the extreme environment of uranium and nitric acid contaminated soil adjacent to disposal ponds of the doe field research centre in the oak ridge national laboratory reservation in tennessee  <cit> . the genus rahnella comprises three closely related species that cannot be phenotypically differentiated: rahnella aquatilis, rahnella genomospecies  <dig> and rahnella genomospecies  <dig>  <cit> .

in recent years interest in certain rahnella strains increased because of their remarkable properties. rahnella might be useful for control of plant pathogens like erwinia amylovora causing fire blight of apple trees or xanthomonas campestris, the causal agent of black rot  <cit> . several strains seem to improve plant nutrition, as they are able to fix nitrogen  <cit>  and to solubilise hydroxyapatite, thus converting phosphate to a plant utilisable form  <cit> . the production of polysaccharides, especially levan and lactan, by different rahnella isolates is intensively studied, because these macromolecules have ideal properties for industrial applications  <cit> . some reports have described rahnella as an opportunistic human pathogen but infections with rahnella are usually limited to immunocompromised patients and recovery is rapid  <cit> . however, antibiotic resistances and enterotoxins encoded by several strains  <cit>  might spread within microbial communities. thus, an improved understanding of mobile genetic elements of rahnella is crucial to assess the potential of lateral gene transfer to other species including human pathogens. nevertheless, although rahnella is widely distributed and frequent on vegetables and therefore likely to be routinely present in the human diet, little is known about plasmids of this genus. so far only one rahnella plasmid, phw <dig>  has been characterised  <cit> . phw <dig> belongs to the cole <dig> family, is non-mobile and stably maintained even in the absence of selective pressure. to gain insights into the frequency, diversity and evolution of small  rahnella plasmids, we isolated strains from different geographic origins and sample materials. most plasmids belonged to the cole <dig> family but we also found members of other groups, including plasmids replicating by the rolling circle mechanism. in addition, sequence analysis provided evidence for lateral gene transfer within rahnella as well as between rahnella and other genera.

RESULTS
isolation of strains, screening for plasmids and cloning
forty five rahnella strains were isolated from vegetables obtained from supermarkets or sampled from fields. isolates from the same sample were only included in the collection if they differed in at least one biochemical characteristic or the partial 16s rrna gene sequence to avoid multiple sampling of the same strain. this collection was complemented by  <dig> strains obtained from culture collections and two strains that had been previously investigated for plasmid content . thus, in total  <dig> strains were included in this study and  <dig> of them  contained small plasmids, as revealed by dna isolation and subsequent gel electrophoresis. nine of these strains contained one plasmid and one of them had two. therefore,  <dig> novel plasmids were detected in addition to phw <dig>  their sizes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, which is typical for small plasmids from enterobacteria  <cit> . the method we used for detection of plasmid dna preferentially selects for small plasmids  rather than large dna molecules. thus, the presence of large plasmids in the investigated strains cannot be excluded. cloning and sequencing of the isolated plasmids revealed that the majority of them  belonged to the cole <dig> group . in addition, one cole2-like plasmid  was isolated. the three remaining plasmids  are likely to replicate by the rolling circle mechanism. phw <dig> belonged to the well-described pc194/pub <dig> family, while phw <dig> and phw <dig> showed homology to different groups of poorly characterised plasmids.

cole1-like plasmids
the replication regions of the cole1-like plasmids showed the typical elements: rna i, rna ii, a single strand initiation site  and a terh sequence for termination of lagging-strand synthesis. phylogenetic analysis based on the rna ii sequence revealed that phw <dig>  phw <dig>  phw114a, phw114b, phw <dig> and phw <dig> represented a subgroup within the cole <dig> family together with peca <dig>  a plasmid isolated from pectobacterium atrosepticum  <cit> . phw <dig> did not fall into this subgroup and was more related to other cole1-like plasmids . not only the replication regions but also the multimer resolution sites  were closely related in all cole1-like plasmids of rahnella. in a phylogenetic tree based on mrs sites  most plasmids isolated from rahnella formed a cluster similar to the rna ii tree, confirming that they form a separate class within the cole <dig> family.

it might be thought surprising that all multimer resolution sites of plasmids depicted in fig.  <dig> are in the same orientation with respect to the replication origin . this is also true for all cole1-like plasmids in fig. 2a. the explanation for this observation may lie in the intimate association of replication control and multimer resolution in the stable maintenance of cole1-like plasmids. because all of the cole <dig> replication origins in a cell function independently, plasmid dimers  replicate twice as often as monomers. as a result, dimers accumulate rapidly and clonally in a process known as the dimer catastrophe  <cit> . rnai-rnaii copy number control counts origins rather than plasmids, so a dimer is not differentiated from two monomers. consequently the copy number  of dimers is approximately half that of monomers. cole <dig> lacks active partition, so plasmid stability requires the maintenance of a high copy number. as a result the copy number depression caused by dimer accumulation causes plasmid instability  <cit> . one part of the solution to this problem is the resolution of dimers or higher multimers to monomers by site-specific recombination. the multimer resolution site of cole <dig>  contains binding sites for the host-encoded recombinase xercd and the accessory protein argr . they act together with pepa  to convert dimers to monomers by site-specific recombination  <cit> . conserved a-t tracts phased at approximately  <dig>  bp intervals facilitate the curvature of the region between the argr and xerc/xerd binding sites, which is thought to be beneficial for recombination complex formation  <cit> . these sequence elements are conserved in the mrs sites of the cole1-like plasmids .

multimer resolution is necessary but not sufficient to combat the threat of the dimer catastrophe. a checkpoint, mediated by the small regulatory transcript rcd, ensures that the cell does not divide before multimers have been resolved completely to monomers  <cit> . rcd binds to the enzyme tryptophanase, stimulating the production of indole which inhibits cell division by an unknown mechanism  <cit> . rcd is expressed from the pcer promoter within cer. pcer is active in plasmid multimers but is repressed in monomers by fis and xercd  <cit> . a fis binding site important for regulation of pcer has been mapped recently  <cit>  .

as stated above, we observed that the multimer resolution sites of the cole1-like plasmids were in the same orientation with respect to the replication origin . in other words rnaii and rcd are invariably transcribed in the same direction. a possible explanation could lie in the complex regulation of pcer. fis is required for high fidelity repression of the promoter in plasmid monomers but it is the lifting of xercd-mediated repression in plasmid dimers which is thought to induce synthesis of rcd and the inhibition of cell division  <cit> . the main evidence supporting this hypothesis is that, while the mutational inactivation of either xerc or xerd in a cell containing plasmid monomers gave a substantial increase in rcd expression, there was no induction of rcd expression when argr or pepa was inactivated  <cit> . rnaii read-through transcription entering cer  would first displace argr/pepa which will ensure that pcer remains inactive. if, however, cer was in the opposite orientation, transcription might displace xercd, inducing transient expression of rcd from plasmid monomers. a similar argument can be made for the progress of the replication fork through cer. in the existing orientation the fork will displace argr before xercd, thus ensuring that pcer remains repressed during replication. moreover, active pcer facing in the opposite direction might transiently stall the replication fork, since active promoters can act as replication barriers  <cit> .

in addition to the replication unit and the mrs all sequenced cole1-like plasmids possessed a conserved open reading frame with homology to exci of cole <dig> . exci was originally believed to mediate entry exclusion of homologous plasmids  <cit>  but later it was convincingly shown that mbed exhibits this activity  <cit> . therefore the function of exci remains unknown.

in addition to these general features most cole1-like plasmids contained highly conserved regions as indicated in fig.  <dig>  clearly these plasmids show a highly mosaic structure. since phw114a and phw114b reside in the same strain, their similarity can be potentially explained by recent recombination events in their host. however, the structures of the other plasmids argue strongly for frequent horizontal transfer within rahnella and between rahnella and pectobacterium, the host of peca <dig>  interestingly, none of the cole1-like plasmids from rahnella possessed any known mobilisation system.

phw <dig> is a cole2-like plasmid
phw <dig>  like the cole1-family plasmids, showed a hybrid structure. it possessed a cole2-like replication system composed of a repa gene encoding the replication protein and a conserved nucleotide sequence that might function as oriv . while the replication origins of cole2-like plasmids are usually located immediately downstream of the repa gene  <cit> , the putative oriv of phw <dig> was separated from repa by an insertion of more than  <dig> kb with an unusually low g+c content of 36% . interestingly, this insert comprised two genes that seemed to be cistronic with repa. orf <dig> showed distant similarity to a putative atpase from shewanella woodyi and orf <dig> was weakly homologous to a hypothetical protein from lyngbya sp. . whether these genes have a role in plasmid replication or maintenance cannot be predicted. an insert of low g+c content adjacent to repa has also been described for the cole2-like plasmid pub <dig>  <cit>  but the inserts of phw <dig> and pub <dig> are distinct. another module found on phw <dig> was a mobilisation system of the cole1-superfamily composed of a conserved transfer origin  and  <dig> genes: moba, mobb, mobc and mobd  <cit> . close homologues of these genes were present on pub <dig>  highlighting the close relationship between phw <dig> and pub <dig>  it is also interesting to note that neither phw <dig> nor pub <dig> possessed a xercd-type multimer resolution system, although this type is frequent among cole2-like plasmids  <cit> . the last module was located downstream of the mobilisation system and consisted of two open reading frames with remarkable homology to two consecutive genes of unknown function in the chromosome of erwinia tasmaniensis et1/ <dig>  <cit> . the significance of this will be discussed below.

plasmids sharing homology to rolling circle replicons
while the plasmids described above exhibited clear homology to previously classified plasmids, database searches with phw <dig> retrieved only distantly-related sequences. the translated amino acid sequence of the largest orf of phw <dig> was 19%, 17% and 16% identical to replication proteins of pzmo <dig>  pca <dig>  and pub <dig>  respectively . importantly, the metal binding domain showed the typical signature huhxluxv and the catalytic domain contained the conserved tyr residue involved in the nucleophilic attack on the plasmid dna at initiation of replication  <cit> , identifying orf <dig> as repa and phw <dig> as a member of the pc194/pub <dig> family. a sequence was present upstream of repa that might function as oriv . interestingly, the putative oriv was preceded by  <dig> perfect and  <dig> imperfect direct repeats of the sequence gggtttt. such a motif has not been described so far for any pc194/pub110-like plasmid. in addition, phw <dig> possessed a putative mobilisation protein of the mobq family. although the homology was low, the typical motifs were present  <cit> . due to a lack of conservation no putative orit could be identified. orf <dig> of phw <dig> was similar to imcc of legionella pneumophila. several genes of the imc/dot complex are essential for the ability of l. pneumophila to survive in macrophages during lung infection such as legionnaires' disease. however, no function has so far been attributed to imcc  <cit> .

phw <dig> showed similarity to members of a poorly studied plasmid family . a  <dig> amino acid protein of phw <dig> showed more than 70% identity to the putative replication protein of pvcg <dig>  and  <dig> % identity to repa from pam <dig> . the involvement of the latter in replication has been proven experimentally  <cit> . in addition phw <dig> comprised a cole1-type mobilisation system  and two open reading frames of unknown function.

phw <dig>  the smallest plasmid found in the genus rahnella, belonged to a novel, yet uncharacterised class of plasmids. it consisted of only  <dig> bp and possessed two orfs. orf <dig> showed similarity to relaxases of the pmv158-superfamily mediating plasmid mobilisation. the characteristic motif hxdexxphxh, as well as an invariant arg residue in the n-terminus, were present  <cit>  and a putative orit could be identified approximately  <dig> bp upstream of orf <dig> . thus orf <dig> was named mob. blast and fasta searches with the translated amino acid sequence of orf <dig> identified homologous sequences from two uncharacterised plasmids from klebsiella pneumoniae, pigrk and pigms <dig>  and one plasmid from ruminobacter amylophilus, prao <dig> . iterated psi-blast searches with orf <dig> from phw <dig> as well as with rep from phw <dig> retrieved sequences of replication proteins from psn2-like plasmids and pjw <dig>  indicating that all these plasmids might form a super-family . however, the rep sequence identity between members of different clades shown in fig. 4b was around 10% in pair wise alignments and only two amino acids are invariant in all replication proteins of the plasmids analysed . a final decision whether these plasmids are members of a common super-family is not possible.

the very weak similarity of phw <dig> to well characterised plasmids raised the question whether phw <dig> should be classified as a rolling circle plasmid. however, we observed that increasing the size of phw <dig> to more than  <dig> kb by insertion of foreign dna fragments rendered this plasmid unstable  which is a common phenomenon for rolling circle vectors  <cit> . to provide further experimental evidence a construct containing the rep gene and two copies of the upstream sequences in tandem repeat was generated. these upstream sequences are presumed to contain the origin of replication which is usually located 5' of the rep gene in rolling circle plasmids. this construct was transformed into the reca- strain e. coli invα f' and independent clones were grown for  <dig> generations. plasmid dna prepared from these cultures showed two bands after linearisation with restriction enzymes . the larger band of approximately  <dig>  kb corresponded to the introduced plasmid. the smaller band, present in variable amounts, had a size of approximately  <dig>  kb, consistent with the loss of one copy of the origin of replication. frequent deletion of one replication origin is evidence for a rolling circle replication mechanism, because replication initiated at the second origin may terminate at the first. this causes that the part of the plasmid between the two origins to be deleted  <cit> . as a control a similar construct containing two copies of the ori from phw <dig> , was tested in the same way. this construct maintained both origins as indicated by presence of only one band with a size of  <dig>  kb . these data provide convincing evidence that phw <dig> replicates by the rolling circle replication mechanism, and that the origin of replication is located upstream of the rep gene.

both phw <dig> and phw <dig> showed strikingly low g+c contents of only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. usually the g+c contents of plasmids are correlated with the chromosomal g+c contents of their hosts . phw <dig> as well as phw <dig> and its close homologues pigrk, pigms <dig> and prao <dig> clearly deviate from this rule. many rolling circle plasmids isolated from gram positive bacteria have a low g+c content  <cit>  . thus phw <dig> and its homologues might have been acquired from gram positive bacteria. on the other hand, ruminobacter amylophilus, the host species of prao <dig>  has a g+c content of approximately 41%. recently plasmids with low g+c content in their replication regions, which are distinct from phw <dig> or phw <dig>  were isolated from soil bacteria. these plasmids could replicate in e. coli but their natural host might be acinetobacter  <cit> , a genus of gram negative bacteria with a g+c content of about 40%. also some genera of the enterobacteriaceae, e.g. buchnera, hamiltonella, proteus or moraxella have strikingly low g+c contents. it will be interesting to see if plasmids similar to phw <dig> are isolated from such genera or from gram positive microorganisms in the future.

evidence for horizontal exchange of genetic information between plasmids from rahnella and bacterial chromosomes
several plasmids possessed genes or regions homologous to sections of enterobacterial chromosomes . the most interesting examples were parts of phw <dig>  which were homologous to the chromosome of erwinia tasmaniensis et/ <dig>  and a gene cluster of phw <dig> similar to an operon of photorhabdus luminescens tt <dig>  stretches of approximately  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp of phw <dig> had identities of more than 90% to parts of the chromosome of e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> at the nucleotide level . the  <dig> bp region of phw <dig> was a small part of the plasmid moba gene while the  <dig> bp region comprised orf <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of it, orf <dig>  the intergenic region between orf <dig> and repa and the main part of repa. the corresponding region on the e. tasmaniensis chromosome had a similar architecture: two small open reading frames of unknown function and a repa-like gene. interestingly, while repa proteins encoded by cole2-like plasmids showed a high degree of similarity from the n- to the c-terminus, the repa-like protein of e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> was highly similar at the n-terminus but the last  <dig> amino acids were unrelated . this repa version might therefore not be functional. a blast search with the e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> region homologous to phw <dig> indicated a hybrid structure: the 3' part harbouring the two orfs was similar to other enterobacterial chromosomes, while the 5' part containing the truncated repa retrieved only plasmid sequences. with the full-length sequence there was no hit apart from phw <dig>  this region of the e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> chromosome might therefore be the result of a recent insertion of a part of a plasmid related to phw <dig> 

phw <dig> possessed a cluster of three genes, orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  that showed homology to an operon of the p. luminescens chromosome . although similar genes were also present in other genera, this particular arrangement could only be observed in p. luminescens. however, since the chromosome of rahnella is not sequenced, this gene cluster of phw <dig> might also originate from the genome of its host. to test this hypothesis we investigated genomic dna of several rahnella strains by southern blot analysis using a probe containing the main parts of orf <dig> and orf <dig> . only in the host strain of phw <dig>  dsm 4594t, a signal could be detected which corresponded to the expected restriction fragment of the plasmid itself. signals indicative of genomic copies of orf <dig> and orf <dig> could neither be detected in dsm 4594t, nor in any other strains of rahnella aquatilis. different strains of rahnella genomospecies  <dig> and genomospecies  <dig> did not show any signal either. thus, it is most likely that the orf <dig> orf <dig> orf <dig> gene cluster originates from p. luminescens  but not from rahnella.

photorhabdus is an enterobacterial symbiont of soil nematodes that infect various insects. after the nematode attacks an insect p. luminescens is released and produces a wide range of virulence factors ensuring rapid insect killing  <cit> . recently it has been shown that rahnella is the predominant species in the intestinal tract of the ghost moth hepialus gonggaensis  <cit> , indicating that rahnella might frequently be present in insects. on the other hand, e. tasmaniensis is common on apple and pear barks and blossoms, and rahnella has been isolated from apple and pear fruits  <cit> . therefore, rahnella seems to have overlapping habitats with p. luminescens and e. tasmaniensis, which might favour exchange of mobile genetic elements between rahnella and these species.

CONCLUSIONS
the frequency of small  plasmids is highly variable within the enterobacteriaceae. for instance, they are extremely rare in citrobacter freundii while 42% of escherichia coli isolates possess at least one plasmid  <cit> . for the genus rahnella we observed plasmid-containing isolates at a frequency of 19%, which is in the average range. cole1-like plasmids were the predominant family, which is typical for enterobacterial genera. most cole1-like plasmids from rahnella formed a subgroup within the cole <dig> family on the basis of rna ii or mrs-based phylogenetic trees. the mrs sites of the cole1-plasmids were arranged in a constant orientation with respect to the replication origin. such conservation is likely to prevent inappropriate activation of the pcer promoter by read-through transcription or during replication. high-fidelity control of pcer is essential because the promoter directs expression of a small rna that causes inhibition of cell division by stimulating indole production. the cole1-plasmids shared extensive regions of high sequence homology in coding and in non-coding regions, indicating frequent horizontal gene transfer and recombination events among plasmids within the genus rahnella. interestingly, none of the cole1-like plasmids found in this study possessed a mobilisation system. in contrast, the other plasmids analysed  contained mobilisation genes. phw <dig> is a member of the pc194/pub <dig> family. phw <dig> and phw <dig> belong to different groups of poorly-characterised plasmids and might form a super-family with psn2-like plasmids and pjw <dig>  to our surprise the plasmids lacked genes which confer an obvious benefit upon their hosts. of course some of the genes with unknown function might encode proteins with advantageous functions but at least for some of the plasmids the term "selfish dna" seems appropriate. the best example is phw <dig>  the smallest plasmid found in rahnella. this plasmid possessed only two orfs, a putative replication gene and one for mobilisation. since these coding sequences cover more than 70% of the plasmid, and additional regions are expected to function as oriv and orit, the plasmid is simply too small to bear any gene beneficial to the host. the low g+c content of this plasmid might indicate that rahnella is not its normal host. in contrast, the close similarities among the cole1-like plasmids provided compelling evidence that rahnella is their normal host. the presence of genes probably derived from p. luminescens on phw <dig> and stretches of the chromosome of e. tasmaniensis highly homologous to parts of phw <dig> highlight the importance of plasmids for genetic exchange of even chromosomal sequences among different genera.
