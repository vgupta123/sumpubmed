BACKGROUND
abdominal aortic aneurysm  affects approximately 5% of men and 1% of women aged > <dig> years  <cit> . the principal concern with the condition is aortic rupture which is frequently fatal. currently the only treatment option for aaa is surgery and approximately  <dig>  aortic repairs are performed annually in the usa  <cit> . aaa accounts for approximately  <dig>  deaths annually in the usa despite the increasing numbers of elective aortic repairs  <cit> . there is increasing interest in using animal models of aaa to investigate mechanisms important in aneurysm development and progression in order to develop new non-interventional treatments and better ways of monitoring disease progression  <cit> . currently rodent models of aaa are most commonly employed, particularly through infusion of angiotensin ii in hyperlipidaemic mice, such as apolipoprotein e deficient  animals  <cit> . this mouse model has a number of similarities to human aaa such as the preponderance of aneurysm formation in males and the focal nature of aortic dilatation  <cit> . the model also displays a number of differences from human aaa, for example aneurysms commonly involve the suprarenal aorta, dissection is an important histological finding and the infrarenal aorta is rarely if ever affected  <cit> . in contrast the infrarenal aorta is the most common site of aaa in humans. these and other disparities between this mouse model and human aaa stimulated us to investigate the gene expression profile of aneurysms in the apoe-/- mouse model. the aim of the current study was to identify genes and pathways associated with aneurysm formation in the angiotensin ii infused apoe-/- mouse model. we used three approaches. firstly we aimed to identify genes which might underlie the protection of the infrarenal aorta from aneurysm formation in apoe-/- mice. secondly we aimed to identify genes which were differentially expressed within the aortas of mice developing aneurysms in comparison to those that did not. finally we selectively examined whether the differences in gene expression associated with aneurysm formation translated into similar changes in protein expression. the design of these studies is illustrated in table  <dig>  our findings suggest the importance of chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, leukocyte transendothelial migration mechanisms, a number of different signalling pathways  and proteolytic mechanisms in aneurysm formation in these mice supporting the relevance of this model to human aaa  <cit> .

RESULTS
comparison of gene expression in aneurysm prone suprarenal compared to aneurysm resistant infrarenal aorta
a total of  <dig>  transcripts  were expressed above background and compared between segments. a total of  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed  between supra and infrarenal aortic segments . a full list of transcripts is given in additional file  <dig> and examples of potentially relevant genes shown in table  <dig>  a number of these genes may be relevant to the predilection of the suprarenal aorta to aneurysm formation based on knowledge of their functional importance or their previous identification in human aaa association studies  <cit> . ucn <dig> for example, which was downregulated in the suprarenal aorta, has been demonstrated to antagonize angiotensin induced production of oxygen derived free radicals in vitro and play a vascular protective role in animal models  <cit> . pik3ap <dig>  dapk <dig> and cd <dig> have previously been identified to be upregulated within human aaa biopsies  <cit> . since vascular smooth muscle apoptosis and inflammation have been demonstrated to be important mechanisms in human aaa, upregulation of dapk <dig> and cd <dig> may be relevant to the predilection of the suprarenal aorta to aneurysm formation in apoe-/- mice  <cit> . perhaps more important to the predilection of the suprarenal aorta to aneurysm formation are the downregulation of a number of genes coding for structural extracellular matrix proteins including lama <dig>  myo18b and the cytoskeletal protein tuba <dig> . lama <dig> has been identified to be downregulated within human aaa biopsies  <cit> .

genes expressed in aortas from mice with aneurysms compared to those without aneurysms and controls
maximum aortic diameters measured in the aortic arch, thoracic, suprarenal and infrarenal aortas in saline controls and mice exposed to angiotensin ii that did and did not develop aneurysms are shown in table  <dig> for animals used in the microarray experiment . aortic diameters were similar between non-aneurysmal angiotensin ii perfused mice and saline controls. we used volcano plots to identify differentially expressed genes between groups using our pre-defined criteria, i.e. 2-fold differential expression and uncorrected p value <  <dig>  by unpaired t-test. the numbers of transcripts differentially expressed in comparison between the  <dig> groups of mice are shown in additional file  <dig>   <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed  between aortas of mice exposed to angiotensin ii which developed aneurysms and those that did not develop aneurysms  .  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed  between aortas of mice exposed to angiotensin ii which developed aneurysms and saline controls .  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed  between aortas of mice exposed to angiotensin ii which did not develop aneurysms and saline controls . to further analyse these results, we concentrated on the transcripts differentially expressed between the aortas of mice that had been exposed to angiotensin ii and had or had not developed aaas . we considered that genes identified by this analysis would be most likely to represent those relevant to aneurysm formation or resistance rather than simply reflecting the effects of angiotensin ii. we also wanted to incorporate some of the findings relevant to the saline control group as they enabled us to have a measure of the baseline level of expression of different genes. this group allowed us to better postulate genes upregulated in the aaa resistant aortas, and thus of potential protective value against aaa. we carried out hierachical clustering analysis incorporating expression levels from all three groups of mice for the  <dig> transcripts that were differentially expressed in angiotensin ii treated mice with and without aneurysms. this analysis is illustrated in terms of a heatmap, with a gene tree showing clustering of individual transcripts, in figure  <dig>  each line in the heatmap represents a transcript with mean upregulated  or downregulated  in expression within the three groups. no change in expression is indicated in black. hierachical clustering analysis indicated four main patterns of transcript expression . transcripts grouped in pattern  <dig>  showed decreased expression in aneurysm resistant aortas relative to other groups and included genes such as ccl <dig>  and mmp <dig> which have been noted to be upregulated in human aaa biopsies   <cit> . pattern  <dig> transcripts  showed increased expression in aneurysms and included many genes associated with inflammation including matrix metalloproteinase encoding genes , genes encoding markers of inflammatory cells  and many cytokine and chemokine genes  . many of these genes, particularly those related to leukocyte chemotaxis, have previously been identified as upregulated within human aaa biopsies   <cit> . pattern  <dig> transcripts  were downregulated in the aortas of mice resistant to aneurysm formation. the difference between pattern  <dig> and pattern  <dig> transcripts is that in pattern  <dig>  genes are most highly expressed in the aaa group, whereas pattern  <dig> genes are, in general, more highly expressed in the saline group. this can be clearly seen on the heatmap  where pattern  <dig> genes in the aaa group are mainly coloured red compared to red/black in saline group, whereas pattern  <dig> genes are red/black in the aaa group and red in the saline group. although the clustering algorithim has separated these groups of genes, we believe that both pattern  <dig> and pattern  <dig> genes can be considered "pathogenic". additional file  <dig> shows transcripts  that were associated with known genes and were significantly downregulated  with respect to both saline controls and mice that develop aneurysms. two of these "pathogenic" pattern  <dig> genes, namely apoc <dig>  and stxbp <dig> , have been previously demonstrated to be upregulated within biopsies of human aaa  <cit> . pattern  <dig> transcripts  were upregulated in mice resistant to aneurysm formation  and we considered that upregulation of these may be "protective" for aneurysm formation. it is interesting to note that a number of the genes identified in pattern  <dig> have been previously shown to be downregulated within human aaa biopsies supporting their potential protective role   <cit> .

shown are examples of genes which were significantly up-regulated  within the aortas of mice that received angiotensin ii and did not develop aaas by comparison to mice which developed aaas. also shown is comparison with findings from the aortas of saline control mice. genes were selected from the full list of differentially expressed genes  based on their likely functional importance and previous association with human aaa. genes highlighted with † have previously been identified as down-regulated within human aaa in a whole genome expression study  <cit> . cf: compared to; ns: not significant.

based on previous studies demonstrating the importance of inflammation in aaa we selected a number of inflammation associated markers to validate which were differentially expressed between aortic aneurysms and control aortas  <cit> . initially we confirmed the up-regulation of il <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and mmp <dig> within aortic aneurysms using real time pcr . these genes were highly upregulated in aortic aneurysms by comparison to aortas from both control groups in microarray studies and real time pcr . we also confirmed the differential expression of the tnfrsf11b  and tgfb <dig>  genes across the three groups translated to differences in protein expression using samples from study  <dig>  we measured the concentration of opg and tgfb- <dig> in the suprarenal segments of angiotensin ii treated mice that developed aaa  and those that did not  and found that both proteins were expressed at higher concentrations in aortas of mice with aneurysms, p <  <dig>  . using immunohistochemistry we demonstrated that opg was found within the medial layers and remodeled adventitia of aortas with aneurysm, whereas little was detected in aneurysm-resistant aortas or saline controls .

shown are median  of relative gene expression  in whole aortas used in the micro-array studies removed from mice exposed to angiotensin ii that developed aaas  or no aaa  or saline controls .

investigation of known functional kegg pathways related to the differentially expressed genes
kegg pathway analysis of transcripts upregulated in the aaa group compared to the no aaa group using webgestalt, revealed that of the  <dig> known genes in the input list,  <dig> of these could be assigned to one or more kegg pathways . this pathway analysis revealed a significant enrichment for genes involved in leukocyte recruitment, transendothelial migration and b lymphocyte receptor signalling and identified a number of cell lineage specific genes associated with aneurysm . chemokine genes upregulated in aneurysms included ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> , suggesting that all these inflammatory cell types are recruited to mouse aortic aneurysms. genes that can be considered as markers for the following cell types were upregulated in aneurysms : neutrophils ; t lymphocytes  and b lymphocytes ; and monocyte/macrophages . we used ihc to confirm the recruitment of neutrophils, t and b lymphocytes, dendritic cells and monocyte/macrophages to aneurysmal but not aneurysm-resistant aortas .

pathways were identified using webgestalt by comparison of differentially expressed genes in the aortas of mice that did and did not develop aneurysms following angiotensin ii infusion. transcripts with > <dig> fold increase in expression in aaa compared to no aaa and p <  <dig>  were submitted for pathway analysis. pathways are linked to the kegg website  and genes are linked to gene information. p value indicates the uncorrected significance of enrichment calculated from the hypergeometric test.

discussion
mouse models of human diseases are potentially important tools with which to investigate mechanisms involved in the pathology and identify new treatments. currently a number of animal models of human aaa are available  <cit> . many of these models require significant interventions such as exposing the aorta and subsequently infusing or painting elastolytic solution on a segment of the artery to induce weakening and inflammation. currently the angiotensin ii infusion model is most commonly used, possibly due to the relatively ease with which aneurysms are produced and the lack of requirement for what might be considered artificial manipulation of the aorta. to our knowledge this is the first study to examine whole genome expression in relation to aneurysm formation within this model. our findings demonstrate that aneurysms forming in apoe-/- mice have marked influx by a range of inflammatory cells and upregulation of cytokines which have all been previously demonstrated in human aaa  <cit> . these findings confirm those from more selective previous studies within this model  <cit> . importantly they suggest the value of this model for investigating the inflammatory and cytokine aspects of human aaa. we also demonstrated the upregulation of a range of chemokines, cytokines and proteolytic enzymes, such as ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  il <dig> and mmp <dig> which have been previously implicated in human aaa  <cit> . the upregulation of the latter genes in aaas was validated using real time pcr. we identified genes up or downregulated in the aortas of mice resistant to aneurysm formation suggesting potentially protective and pathological roles of these genes respectively in aaa. sclerostin expression is decreased within human aaa biopsies compared to controls, however the significance of this finding is unclear  <cit> . we found increased expression of the sclerostin gene  in the aortas of mice resistant to aneurysm formation compared to both mice with aneurysms and saline controls, suggesting that sclerostin may play a role in inhibiting aortic dilatation. the ability of sclerostin to antagonise transforming growth factor beta, which has been linked to aortic aneurysm development, could be of significance in an aortic protection role for this gene  <cit> . acta <dig>  expression was increased in aortas resistant to aneurysm formation compared to other groups. acta <dig> encodes the single most abundant protein in vascular smooth muscle cells, and mutations in the human gene are associated with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections  <cit> . increased expression of acta <dig> and other genes encoding smooth muscle cell proteins , in aortas protected from aneurysm, highlight the importance of vascular smooth muscle cells in maintaining vascular integrity. we observed downregulation of the genes encoding kininogen , apolipoprotein ci  and the neutrophil-associated leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein  <dig>  amongst others, in aortas of mice resistant to aneurysm suggesting that they may be pathological genes. the role of these in aneurysm formation warrants further investigation.

we also investigated genes that might underlie the predilection for suprarenal aneurysm formation within this model, highlighting downregulation of a number of genes which may explain the susceptibility of the suprarenal aorta to aneurysm formation. urocortin has been shown in vitro and within animal models to inhibit the effects of the renin-angiotensin system, thus downregulation of ucn <dig>  within the suprarenal aorta of apoe-/- mice may be relevant to its predilection for aneurysm formation following angiotensin ii infusion  <cit> . we also demonstrated downregulation of lama <dig>  within the suprarenal aorta. this extracellular matrix protein has been demonstrated to be present in reduced concentrations within some human aaas and therefore may also be relevant to the preponderance of the suprarenal aorta to aneurysm formation  <cit> . in vitro laminin also plays important roles in modulating inflammation and mmp production suggesting its relevance to aneurysm formation  <cit> . further studies will be required to investigate these candidate genes for example employing deficient mice.

a small number of previous studies have used expression arrays to examine gene transcripts associated with aaa in rodent models or patient samples  <cit>  . there are a number of issues to consider when interpreting the results of the present study and those previously conducted, such as sample sizes, controls used, model employed  and adjustment for multiple testing. only one of the previous studies was a whole genome expression assessment, similar to the current study, with other studies examining much smaller numbers of transcripts. the sample sizes employed in all studies means that the power to detect differentially expressed genes is limited; therefore all current studies would have been expected to generate a large number of false negatives. we have therefore concentrated on identifying genes which were identified in the current study and also in these previous investigations and highlighted these throughout our tables . a number of chemokines were identified in all studies underlining the findings of the current investigation. other common mechanisms identified to be associated with aaa included pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix proteolysis. the design of the current experiment has some advantages over previous studies in the use of controls employed. we utilised two control sample types within study  <dig>  i.e. aortas from mice receiving saline infusion but importantly also from mice that received angiotensin ii and did not develop aneurysms. this has enabled us to try and isolate effects associated with aaa rather than just those due to angiotensin ii. findings in previous rodent studies may have related in part simply due to the effects of elastase  <cit> . controls for human expression array studies are problematic for a number of reasons, including the large amount of patient to patient variations, and the effects of factors that are impossible to control for in small samples such as differences in medication taken and co-morbidities  <cit> .

this study is the first to carry out a whole genome expression analysis within the angiotensin ii- apo e-/- model. we used an explorative approach using relatively small numbers of arrays . we were not adequately powered to adjust for multiple testing given the number of transcripts examined. unlike some other microarray studies we have used real time pcr, ihc and elisa to confirm some of our findings rather than relying on rna assessment alone  <cit> . numerous studies have now demonstrated the validity of microarray platforms therefore we felt it would be useful to demonstrate the functional relevance of altered rna expression  <cit> . our findings suggest the value of this mouse model as one to investigate the role of inflammation, cell recruitment and proteolysis in aaa.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion our study supports the value of the angiotensin ii infused apoe-/- mouse model for investigating mechanisms and interventions relevant to human aaa.
