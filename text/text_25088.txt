BACKGROUND
mosquito species exhibit a wide range of distinct daily activity patterns and are, in fact, frequently characterized as to whether their feeding and mating behaviors are diurnal, crepuscular, or nocturnal . activity and blood-feeding rhythms appear to be controlled by a circadian  clock  <cit> . observations of circadian rhythms in the physiology and behavior of the culicine mosquito species aedes aegypti  have been previously reported in the field  and in laboratory studies . both oviposition and sugar-feeding patterns have been explained by an inherited endogenous circadian rhythm  <cit> . entraining of flight pattern caused by the change from light to dark as a time-cue was experimentally studied by taylor and jones <cit> . subsequent publications in the culicine mosquito culiseta incidens reported differences in behavior in constant darkness and constant light after light/dark  <dig> h: <dig> h entraining. the authors proposed the existence of two dependent oscillators which could be temporarily or permanently uncoupled to explain lengthening and shortening of activity periods  <cit> . connection between metabolism, feeding pattern and circadian regulation of gene expression has been explored by das and dimopoulos  <cit> . this study taking advantage of custom designed microarrays has reported that genes controlling feeding behavior are under circadian control. long and short light pulses can alter circadian feeding behavior through unknown molecular mechanisms, possibly involving chemosensory system  <cit> .

in no other insect species have the genes that control circadian rhythms been as well characterized as in drosophila melanogaster. a number of genes have been implicated in the control of circadian rhythms in this species. transcriptional analyses of these suggest a mechanism whereby transcriptional negative feedback loops control cyclic expression  <cit> . the two main regulatory loops of the circadian clock involve the genes period , timeless , clock , cycle , vrille , and par-domain-protein- <dig>   <cit> . regulatory loops control the circadian expression of genes in the clock and determine the abundance of a large number of fluctuating transcripts. these transcripts in turn are thought to be indicators of a pacemaker that controls various aspects of physiology and behavior  <cit> .

orthologues of drosophila circadian genes have been cloned or identified in the mosquitoes anopheles gambiae  <cit>  and ae. aegypti  <cit> . gentile et al  <cit>  cloned and analyzed expression of tim in ae. aegypti. in drosophila, tim controls a central pacemaker and a resetting mechanism that allows the clock to synchronize with environmental light-dark cycles. predicted protein sequence encoded by timeless in ae. aegypti and d. melanogaster were highly similar in domains of known function, suggesting functional conservation. analysis of the daily expression of timeless indicated a peak in mrna abundance around the daily light-dark transition. gentile et al  <cit>  compared the circadian expression of clock genes in ae. aegypti and cx. quinquefasciatus. both species diverged >  <dig> mya but exhibit conserved circadian expression patterns for all major cycling clock genes . however, beyond these few core circadian genes, little is known about circadian oscillations in gene expression in mosquitoes. understanding these oscillations is essential for learning the relationship between the circadian clock and the observed periodicity in mosquito physiology and behavior.

due to the ease with which it can be collected in the field and maintained in the laboratory, ae. aegypti is the most studied of all mosquito species. much of what we know about the genetic, biochemical, physiological, and behavior of mosquitoes has come from this species. for example, a.n. clements'  encyclopedia on mosquito physiology contains  <dig> references and  <dig> of these involve ae. aegypti  <cit> . as importantly the species is the principal vector of the dengue and yellow fever flaviviruses and a host of other important arboviruses throughout all tropical and subtropical regions of the world. many transcriptional studies of genes involved in development  <cit> , competence for pathogen propagation and transmission  <cit> , insecticide resistance  <cit> , blood-feeding  <cit>  and blood meal digestion  <cit>  have been conducted in ae. aegypti. more recently, the species has also been the subject of a number of large scale transcriptional analyses using microarrays to scan for genes involved in insecticide resistance  <cit> , development  <cit> , vector competence  <cit> , and bloodfeeding  <cit> . in no case did these studies  consider the possibility of circadian oscillations in expression of genes under study.

herein we present a study in which we tested for circadian oscillations in expression of genes in a large part of the transcriptome using the agilent® aedes aegypti microarray  <cit>  and an experimental design that has been successfully used to demonstrate circadian cycles of gene transcription in model eukaryotic organisms  and humans. transcripts were collected from the heads of females that were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours old. transcripts were only collected from the heads of females for three reasons. first, whole bodies were not used because various studies have demonstrated asynchronous oscillations in transcript abundance among different organs and tissues. analysis of whole carcasses could therefore mask tissue- or organ-specific oscillations in transcript abundance. second, the head is a discrete structure that can be easily and rapidly dissected from the body without large amounts of contamination by transcripts from other tissues. we are of course assuming uniformity in transcript abundance among different organs and tissues in the head; an assumption that is almost certainly false. third, we wished to avoid gender differences in transcript abundance. we demonstrate that a large number of transcripts in the female head exhibit circadian fluctuations.

RESULTS
the amounts of the  <dig>  unique transcripts on the agilent® aedes aegypti microarray were quantified in adult female heads. the first time point was at  <dig> hours post-eclosion and each subsequent time point was collected every four hours for the next  <dig> hours. a heatmap of the female head transcriptome over  <dig> hours is presented in figure  <dig>  the heatmap shows a clear pattern of two peaks  and two troughs  in levels of gene expression over two days of observation, which corresponds to two  <dig> hour circadian cycles. this pattern is very similar to a previously published circadian heatmap of the murine transcriptome  <cit> .

the majority of transcripts in figure  <dig> exhibit two cycles of oscillations over two days. this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that there is a gradual reduction of signal to noise ratio without an actual loss of periodicity  <cit> . tests for periodicity applied in a straightforward way and testing each expression profile independently report considerable numbers of periodic transcripts . the difference in estimated numbers of transcripts passing the standard cutoff of p =  <dig>  is caused by the different set of assumptions underlying each of the tests. application of statistical tests in a phase continuum setting mitigates some of the critical limitations of periodicity testing and allows improved signal to noise ratio by digital signal processing  <cit> . the numbers of periodic transcripts reported by tests in phase continuum  are much higher and seem to be in a better agreement with the visual pattern  than numbers of rhythmically expressed genes reported in single-gene testing. even the most conservative estimates reveal more cycling genes than previously reported in circadian expression profiling of d. melanogaster. our experiment does not focus specifically on the genes controlled by circadian molecular clock; we register all genes expressed in a rhythmic pattern in ld environment. some of the oscillations we observe may be harder to detect in altered light conditions. although there must be some inter-species differences, we believe that most difference arise from the analysis methodology. the panel of statistical tests used in these studies applied to publicly available circadian expression profiles from the gene expression omnibus  database consistently reports more cycling transcripts than the original publications  <cit> . it is also important to note that results of different tests presented on table  <dig> are different estimations rather than exact count. it is reasonable to assume that among genes tested positive for circadian periodicity there are some false-positive results. in one of the earlier publications ptitsyn et al. proposed a computational experiment with random permutation of time points in microarray circadian expression profiles  <cit> . one of the outcomes of that experiment was estimation of false-positive rate in straight application of pt-test to one expression profile at a time. with all periodicity scrambled by random permutations about 10% of expression profiles still tested positive for baseline circadian rhythm. in our aedes aegypti microarray analysis some of the expression profiles estimated as rhythmic may turn out false-positive in separate validation experiments. however, this number is likely to be less than 10%. highly expressed transcripts have more favorite signal to noise ratio and less likely to produce false-positive results in periodicity tests. on the other hand, it would be incorrect to assume that transcripts that didn't pass the arbitrary p =  <dig>  cutoff in tests are non-periodic. there are also false-negative rhythmically expressed transcripts, particularly among low-expressed genes, for which test are not sufficiently powerful. reproducing the experiment with more time points  can improve both testing for periodicity and determining the phase of oscillation. however, there are ways to improve the validity of existing data. first, selected microarray expression profiles can be validated using alternative rt-pcr technique for estimation of transcript abundance. second, validity of gene expression patterns in time can be considered in the context of their interaction, i.e. within corresponding biological pathways.

all tests used standard p =  <dig>  significance cutoff

selected expression profiles were validated using rt-pcr . overall the rt-pcr profiles are in a good agreement with the microarray profiles . panel b shows agreement between intensity signal from microarray probes  and rt-pcr estimation of gene expression. for compatibility, raw rt-pcr values have been subtracted from the maximum. on the other hand, one of the microarray probes selected for rt-pcr validation demonstrated a clear circadian oscillating profile, but in a counter-phase to microarray expression profile . in turn, microarray probes are not in complete agreement with each other. the first probe  shows a mixed profile, which could be resulting from competing cross-hybridization between different transcripts. in previous publications it has been reported that alternatively polyadenylated transcripts of the same gene can oscillate in counter-phase to one another  <cit> . we hypothesize that rt-pcr expression values show behavior of only one of the alternative transcripts , while microarray probes target the alternative transcript  and both transcripts .

genes encoding the 40s ribosomal protein s <dig> and the 60s ribosomal proteins l <dig>  l <dig>  and p <dig> are commonly used as "standards" for adjusting transcript abundance during rt-pcr. figure 3a demonstrates clear and reproducible oscillations in 40s ribosomal s <dig> transcript abundance among the three probes for this gene in the agilent® array. figure 3b demonstrates clear oscillations in 60s ribosomal transcript abundance for l <dig> , l <dig> , and p <dig> . note also that while 60s l <dig> and l <dig> transcripts are in the same phase that 60s-p <dig> is in opposite phase. thus, conflicting signals would be obtained if one were to use 60s-p <dig> transcript abundance with abundance of any of the other three genes.

a general observation is that more highly transcribed genes tend to have less noisy expression profiles and instead exhibit a clear cycling profile. this is also consistent with the idea that the majority, if not all expressed genes experience diurnal variation in baseline expression. thus we should account for such diurnal oscillation when considering gene function in the context of biological pathways. coordinated non-random timing of peak and troughs of gene expression activity within a functionally related group can also serve as evidence of rhythmic expression.

the first example of coordinated rhythmic pattern in a biological pathway is presented in figure  <dig>  here we present the components of the basic circadian clock identified in the mosquito genome form a circuit of the same design as the d. melanogaster molecular clock. the timeline expression profiles reported in drosophila  <cit>  are similar for the genes forming circadian molecular clock. in our experiment all components of the pathway are found to be oscillating and have expected differences in different phases of the oscillation. this observation confirms the previous report of circadian oscillation in a. aegypti mosquito  <cit> . in contrast to that study we did not attempt to alter the pattern of gene expression by alternation in light condition. instead we used the same type of microarrays to probe longer time spans with regular sampling. this design allowed identification of oscillation and phase shift with more precision in much larger number of expressed genes. the fact that the majority of expressed genes experience circadian oscillation also means that oscillation affects the majority of biological pathways. some of the pathways implicated in oscillatory expression are discussed in das and dimopoulos report  <cit> . we confirm the original report and extrapolate the oscillatory pattern to all other pathways. evidence of coordinated timing of gene expression is seen in figure  <dig>  showing the expression profile of the mosquito basal promoter complex. all elements show some evidence of periodicity, but transcription factors tfiia  and tfiih  are expressed clearly in counter-phase to transcription factors tfiif  and tfiid . previously reported differences in oscillation patterns of basal transcription factors in murine bone  <cit>  has been attributed to differential modulation of gene expression by different signaling systems, creating complex orchestration of transcription for different genes. in a. aegypti the pattern might be less complicated or the analysis might have omitted minor details due to technical noise. overall, parts of the basal transcription complex and transcription factors in particular, follow the pattern set by the elements of the basic molecular clock, such as tfiid-f expressed in the same phase as pdp and tfiia in the same phase with dclk  . timeless  and period  oscillate in the same phase with tfiih slightly ahead of dclk and cycle . among all pathways composed of oscillating genes basic energy metabolism is particularly significant.

the expression profiles of the major components of oxidative phosphorylation are presented in figure  <dig>  remarkably, all genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are among the most prominently oscillating genes. phase shift in production rates for the oxidative phosphorylation genes is in agreement with expectations from the general model of the process: components of the oxidative phase are expressed in counter-phase to the components of the reductive phase. previous studies have pointed to the oxidative phosphorylation pathways as the intrinsic oscillator  <cit>  modulating expression of many genes  <cit>  and gating dna replication  <cit> . other studies outline the regulatory connection between basic metabolism and circadian clock  <cit> . even though these studies used different model organisms it is reasonable to assume a connection between circadian clock and oxidative phosphorylation in mosquitoes as well. we hypothesize that circadian clock and oxidative phosphorylation are two main intrinsic oscillators modulating physiology and behavior of a. aegypti mosquitoes. these oscillators are linked and work in synchrony, but can be temporarily or permanently uncoupled by changing environmental conditions or due to mutations that lead to the creation of the behavioral patterns reported in previous publications  <cit> .

understanding circadian oscillation rhythms and gene synchronization patterns is essential to understanding mosquito molecular biology. pesticide resistance is closely related to detoxification pathways which in turn are interlinked with oxidative phosphorylation. the oscillating pattern of oxidative phosphorylation gene expression may modulate the mosquito's ability to withstand insecticide exposure. on the other hand a mosquito's metabolism is also modified by a blood meal, which changes the energy balance from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, changing the synchronous pattern for multiple genes. this alteration in expression timing can be potentially used to identify the age of larvae and adults, the availability of blood meal and other parameters important for disease control. there is a reason to believe that egg formation in mosquitoes is also gated by oxidative phosphorylation in a way similar to dna replication in yeast  <cit>  thus minimizing dna damage from free radicals. understanding the mechanisms of gene orchestration and correct timing of gene expression may help to identify the most vulnerable times and most promising targets for intervention in ever shifting patterns of interacting genes networks.

we also examined expression of genes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics in general and insecticides in particular . glutathione-s-transferases  are a diverse family of enzymes involved in a wide range of biological processes, many of which involve the conjugation of the tripeptide glutathione to an electrophilic substrate. elevated levels of gst activity have been associated with resistance to all the major classes of insecticides  <cit> . the epsilon-class gsts in particular are frequently associated with resistance. figure  <dig> examined the abundance of transcripts from the eight epsilon class gsts. all of these are located in a single cluster on chromosome  <dig> in the ae. aegypti genome <cit> . figure 7a demonstrates co-oscillation of gst - <dig> , gst - <dig> , and gst - <dig>  transcript abundances while figure 7b shows co-oscillation of gst - <dig>  and gst - <dig>  transcript abundances. figure 7c demonstrates that gst - <dig> , gst - <dig>  and gst - <dig>  transcripts do not co-oscillate with the other gst in figures 7a and 7b nor with one another. gst - <dig> shows only shallow oscillations throughout the experiment. gst - <dig> remains constant with the shallow cosine curve of gst - <dig> until but increases the amplitude in the second half of the experiment. this pattern may reflect variation between parallel batches of biological replicates .

the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily of genes encodes a large and diverse group of proteins that catalyze the oxidation of organic substances including endogenous lipids and steroidal hormones and xenobiotic substances including insecticides. in ae. aegypti members of the cyp9j family in particular seem to be involved in resistance to pyrethroid insecticides <cit> . figure  <dig> examined the abundance of transcripts from  <dig> members of the cyp9j family. all of these except cyp9j <dig>  are located in a single cluster on chromosome  <dig> in the ae. aegypti genome  <cit> . cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig>  and cyp9j27b  are represented by two oligonucleotide probes each and cyp9j27a and b are different but orthologous genes. figure 8a demonstrates co-oscillation of cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig>  and cyp9j <dig> vectorbase:aael014616] while 8b shows co-oscillations in cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> vectorbase:aael014616] and cyp9j <dig>  but shifted by  <dig> hours from the genes in 8a. 8c shows co-oscillations in cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig>  and cyp9j <dig>  but shifted by  <dig> hours from the seven genes in 8b and  <dig> hours from the genes in 8a. 8d shows that cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig> , cyp9j <dig>  and cyp9j <dig>  do not have an obvious oscillating pattern. however, the increase and decline pattern in one of two concatenated profiles might be indicative of a weak oscillation obscured by stochastic noise. we are uncertain as to how these oscillations affect insecticide resistance. metabolic resistance is closely related to detoxification pathways which in turn are interlinked with oxidative phosphorylation. the oscillating pattern of oxidative phosphorylation gene expression may modulate the mosquito's ability to withstand insecticide exposure and suggests the interesting possibility that susceptibility to insecticides may show diurnal fluctuations.

the purpose of these experiments was to document that diurnal fluctuations occur in the heads of female mosquitoes. having demonstrated these diurnal patterns; a whole series of additional questions arise. are there diurnal fluctuations in gene expression in other adult tissues and organs? are diurnal fluctuations seen in the developing embryo? do they occur in larvae? how do the oscillations relate to chitin deposition and sclerotization in the cuticle? how does moulting affect oscillations? is moulting coordinated by oscillations in different tissues? are oscillations coordinated among different tissues? how do these oscillations respond to major perturbations in the mosquitoes environment? specifically, how do diurnal fluctuations respond to a blood meal in the female? are there oscillations in the production of vitellogenins  that arise following a bloodmeal? similarly, how are these perturbations influenced by oviposition? are diurnal fluctuations in cytochrome p450s and glutathione-s-transferases perturbed by exposure to xenobiotics? if so, how soon after exposure? are innate immunity pathways affected by the ingestion or exposure to pathogens? how does mating affect diurnal fluctuations? how are oscillations affected by lengthening or shortening the photoperiod away from the current 12: <dig> pattern? due to the limitations of our incubator, a crepuscular period prior to and following the scotophase could not be included. are the observed oscillations affected by the lack of a crepuscular period? these questions all require very specific experimental designs that are far beyond the scope or intention of the current study.

in this study we have made a first attempt to identify the baseline rhythms and co-oscillation patterns in genes in the female head beyond the basic circadian molecular clock. due to the noisy nature of high-throughput microarray expression analysis we cannot observe a baseline rhythm in abundance of every detected transcript. however, we do observe baseline oscillation in majority of genes and thus it can be reasonably extrapolated that rhythmicity permeates every biological pathway in mosquitoes. we hypothesize that this is orchestrating changes in both mosquito physiology and behavior. apart from the technical challenges of microarray analysis this study is limited in resolution ability by the low sampling rate of circadian time series. we could only distinguish as many as four discrete phases. the sampling rate determines the precision with which one can identify the phase of oscillation and superimpose the timing of expression of inter-dependent genes in biological pathways. we hope to intensify sampling rates in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the utility of understanding the timeline of gene expression throughout the entire transcriptome is not an academic exercise limited to understanding circadian behavior. most transcriptional experimental designs involve comparisons of strains or of individuals from a strain that exhibit different phenotypes. implicit in these comparisons is the assumption that transcript abundance is constant within strains and individuals. if this assumption is invalid these experimental designs may have a low power to detect true differences in gene abundance. furthermore, considered in the broader context of gene interaction networks, timeline expression can help the reverse-engineering of biological pathways, identify alternative transcripts and potential drug targets. these results are the first step towards understanding the structure and orchestration of molecular processes and gene functions in ae. aegypti in relation to the dimension of time.
