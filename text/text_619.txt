BACKGROUND
small rnas  are ubiquitous regulatory molelcules produced by many thousands of endogenous genes. silencing pathways based on srnas that function at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels to negatively regulate the expression of protein-encoding genes have been identified in most eukaryotes. these pathways are also considered to play a role in the silencing of viral rna and the suppression of mobile elements  <cit> . plant srnas can be categorized into several major classes, including microrna , heterochromatic small interfering rna , and phased/secondary sirna , according to their origin and biosynthesis  <cit> . mirnas are transcribed from mirna  gene families, which occur mainly in the intergenic genomic region and sometimes inside protein-coding genes; transcripts eventually become mature mirnas  via processing by dicer-like <dig>  protein  <cit> . sirna is processed from double stranded rna  or from long, perfectly complementary hairpin rna molecules. dsrna is recognized and cleaved by dcl2/3/ <dig> to generate different classes of sirna. hc-sirna is 24 nt long and results from dcl <dig> processing of dsrna transcribed from intergenic or repetitive regions of the genome by the plant-specific rna polymerase pol iv, and possibly also pol v . hc-sirna functions to maintain genome integrity by suppressing transposable elements via an rna-dependent dna methylation  pathway  <cit> . in contrast, pha-sirna is processed by dcl <dig> from dsrna dependent on rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig> . a well-described category of pha-sirna includes trans-acting sirna  of arabidopsis  <cit> . while hc-sirna plays a crucial role in chromatin modification, mirna and pha-sirna function mainly at the posttranscriptional level, via either cleavage or translational suppression of target transcripts, and in a few instances also directing the methylation of dna  <cit> .

mirna has been implicated in the control of diverse cellular, physiological and developmental processes in plants. among plant species, there are several mirna species with well-conserved sequences and functions. for example, mir <dig> targets a series of squamosa-promoter binding protein-like  genes, regulating the phase transition from juvenile to adult during shoot development  <cit> . mir <dig> acts downstream of mir <dig> and mediates regulation of apetala <dig>  and ap2-like genes, which are needed for proper specification of flower organs  <cit> . the relative balance of mir <dig> and mir <dig> is essential for the regulation of phase change and flowering  <cit> . mir <dig> directs cleavage of trans-acting sirna  <dig> gene , leading to production of ta-sirnas  <cit> , which, together with mir <dig> and mir <dig>  targets the auxin response factor  gene family, regulating the response of auxin in plant cells  <cit> .

recent bioinformatics and high-throughput sequencing studies have uncovered a large number of non-conserved mirnas. these are mostly expressed at low levels with divergent target genes; thereby, they may have specialized functions. several non-conserved mirnas indeed function in fine-tuning roles in the target regulatory networks of different plants . discoveries of specific mechanisms and functions of non-conserved plant mirnas over a wide range of conditions are an expanding topic of investigation  <cit> . in pome fruits, some progresses in the identification of mirnas have been achieved. xia et al.  <cit>  identified apple mirnas and pha-sirnas, describing novel regulatory networks targeting a multitude of genes inside and outside the myb family. visser et al.  <cit>  further extended the apple srnaome by characterizing mirnas and sirnas in apple leaves. ma et al.  <cit>  suggested that an apple-specific mirna may affect the disease resistance pathway by targeting a group of nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeats  resistance genes. in addition, niu et al.  <cit>  in silico predicted mirnas using the genome sequence of chinese pear , providing a basic resource to support future research in this specie.

in woody perennial plants, including deciduous fruit trees, such as pear, endodormancy is a strategy for surviving the cold winter. to complete endodormancy and resume growth, low temperatures are required, but the recent global warming trend has sometimes interrupted normal endodormancy establishment and release  <cit> . therefore, elucidation of the mechanism underlying the endodormancy phase transition is necessary for developing countermeasures against the effects of global warming. in a previous study, we carried out transcriptome analysis of japanese pear flower buds during endodormancy phase transition and demonstrated changes in transcript abundance for genes involved in phytohormone metabolism, antioxidant response and methylation changes  <cit> . we also focused on the function of dormancy-associated mads-box genes. however, whether srnas were involved in the phase transition during dormancy has thus far not been well examined.

in this study, we analyze the srnaome of japanese pear flower buds in endodormant and ecodormant stages over two seasons through next-generation sequencing. by implementing of rna-seq and parallel analysis of rna end sequencing , we found that several srna loci differential expressed between endodormancy and ecodormancy stages, demonstrating possible involvement in the regulation of endodormancy release. moreover, we observed a multifunctional mirna precursor mir <dig> and the pha-sirna production within the orf of arf <dig> triggered by a ta-sirna. this work constitutes the study to characterize srnas in pear winter buds and provides a platform for further investigation of specific srnas in various biological processes in pear.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing of srnas in winter flower buds
the plant samples used in the present study have been described in previous reports  <cit> . srna libraries were constructed from flower buds collected on december  <dig>  and december  <dig>  of the 2009/ <dig> winter season and on december  <dig>  and december  <dig>  of the 2010/ <dig> season. as endodormancy released in the late december in both years according to the dvi model  <cit> , our samples thus designated as endo <dig>  eco <dig>  endo <dig> and eco <dig> for respective buds from december  <dig> and  <dig> of the 2009/ <dig> season and from december  <dig> and  <dig> of the 2010/ <dig> season  <cit> . high-throughput sequencing generated at least eighteen million clean reads per sample . the total numbers of reads are similar in all the samples, allowing a meaningful comparison between endodormant and ecodormant stages. after collapsing into unique reads,  <dig> – <dig>  million unique sequences were obtained in each library.table  <dig> summary of next-generation sequencing of small rnas



reads of 19–25 nt accounted for over 95 % of the total reads, among which about half were 24 nt long in all four libraries . the second most abundant size was 23 nt , followed by 21 nt  and 22 nt . the srna sequences were then annotated with repeat-associated sequences and the non-coding rna database   <cit> . sequence reads from rrna, trna and repeat regions made up about 10 % of the unique sequences and 20 % of the redundant sequences in all four samples . for further analysis, reads of length 19-25 nt that were sequenced at least twice were mapped to the chinese pear genome . about 80 % of the sequences mapped to at least one scaffold and were further analyzed.fig.  <dig> size distribution of redundant reads and unique reads in the four libraries used in this work. samples “endo2009” and “endo2010” were collected on dec.  <dig>   <dig> and dec.  <dig>   <dig> , respectively. samples “eco2009” and “eco2010” were harvested and on dec.  <dig>   <dig> and dec.  <dig>   <dig> , respectively



de novo annotation of srna loci in the pear genome
after filtering the reads derived from rrna and trna, clean reads were aligned to the pear genome using bowtie  and were analyzed with shortstack  <cit>  using the default “plant mode.” in total,  <dig>  loci were identified as producing srna , among which  <dig> mirna loci  and  <dig>  other hairpin  rna loci were identified. the srna derived from most of these loci is putatively processed by dicers, but  <dig> loci were annotated as non-dicer processed. the srna loci were grouped according to mapped srna length. as shown in fig.  <dig>  24 nt loci were the most abundant , while 20-21 nt loci occurred least frequently. in all the loci groups, non-hp loci accounted for over 75 % of all loci. in addition, most of the mirna loci were categorized as  <dig> or 22 nt.fig.  <dig> srna clusters  identified by shortstack pipeline. in total,  <dig>  clusters were identified. a distribution of srna loci generating different srna species. 21 nt loci were processed by dcl1/ <dig>  22 nt loci were processed by dcl <dig>  and  <dig>  24 nt loci were processed by dcl <dig>  note that most srna loci in pear generated 24 nt srnas. b distribution of srna loci with different sequence type. mirna loci produce mirnas, hp loci and non-hp loci produce 21–24 nt sirnas



summary of pare-seq
pare-seq of winter flower buds produced  <dig> , <dig> clean reads with sizes of  <dig> and 21 nt, corresponding to  <dig> , <dig> non-redundant tags, among which  <dig> , <dig> tags were successfully mapped to  <dig>  pear transcripts  <cit> . to describe transcriptome-wide cleavage events, we performed the analysis using the well-established pipeline paresnip  <cit> . in total,  <dig> cleavage events  were found in  <dig> genes with statistical significance. these cleavage events fell into categories  <dig> to  <dig>  on the transcript and there is just  <dig> position at the maximum value on the transcript; category  <dig> represented the position with the depth equal to the maximum value  on the transcript, and there is > <dig> position at maximum value; category  <dig> represented the position with the depth  above the average depth, but not the maximum on the transcript; category  <dig> represented the position with the depth  below or equal to the average depth of coverage on the transcript) defined in paresnip . as shown in fig. 3a,  <dig>  % of cleavage events belonged to category  <dig>  which was defined as the most abundant cleavage event on a transcript. the cleaved genes were then subjected to go enrichment analysis. the results showed that “responds to stimulus” was enriched with the lowest false discovery rate , suggesting a role for mirna in regulation of responses to biotic and/or abiotic stimuli. in addition, metabolic process and other  <dig> categories were significantly enriched .fig.  <dig> pare-seq to identify the srna-mediated cleavage in pear winter buds. the mixed samples used for srna-seq were also used for pare-seq. a srna-mediated transcript cleavage identified with the paresnip pipeline. the srnas with 20–22 nt, ≥ <dig> reads in at least one sample were used for analysis. category  <dig> was not included to avoid false positive results. b go enrichment analysis of cleaved genes identified in . only significantly enriched go categories are shown



identification of known mirnas in pear winter flower buds
mir loci identified by shortstack were compared to digitally predicted mirnas  <cit> . of  <dig> annotated mir loci,  <dig> overlapped with previously predicted mir loci, which generated  <dig> mature mirnas . these mir loci produce mirnas in  <dig> mirna families, including  <dig> conserved mirnas and seven less-conserved mirnas .

as the relatively high stringent shortstack algorithm tended to produce false negative results  <cit> , blast-based strategies were also used to identify known mirnas with mirprof  <cit> . the clean reads were compared to a publicly available mirna database  <cit> . when only allowing perfect matches, a total of  <dig> unique sequences were annotated as known mirnas in the four srna libraries. they clustered into  <dig> mirna families, including  <dig> conserved families and  <dig> less-conserved families . the abundance of individual conserved mirnas ranges from several reads to a few million reads in the libraries. these mirnas showed similar expression patterns in the four libraries: mir <dig> was the largest represented mirna family, followed by mir <dig>  both of which have over  <dig> normalized reads in all four libraries. six mirnas  have normalized read counts between  <dig> and  <dig> in at least one library. compared to apple, which contains  <dig> mature mirnas belonging to  <dig> families, the pear winter buds lacked several srna families, such as mir <dig>  probably due to their temporal- or spatial- specific expression that was also observed in apple  <cit> .fig.  <dig> identification and differential expression analysis of known mirnas in pear winter buds between endodormancy and ecodormancy. normalized read counts  of conserved and less-conserved mirnas in the four samples are shown



targets of mirnas were identified using pare-seq data. a total  <dig> genes were identified as targets of conserved mirnas. representative targets of conserved mirnas are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  as previously reported, most conserved mirnas targeted gene families. although most  of the  <dig> identified genes were conserved targets for these mirnas across a wide range of plant species, nine had not been reported in other species. for example, mir <dig>  which is known to target homeobox proteins in plant, was found to target genes encoding fructose-bispospate aldolase and glutathione peroxidase. similarly, mir <dig>  which targeted a series of arf genes, also targeted a gene similar to the arabidopsis responsive to dehydration  <dig>  gene. about two-third of the cleavage events  mediated by conserved mirnas were in category  <dig>  with the maximum depth on the transcripts.

identification of pear-specific mirnas and their targets
to identify pear-specific mirnas, we used two well-established pipelines, shortstack and mircat  <cit> . as mentioned above, shortstack identified  <dig> mirna loci, among which  <dig> were annotated as known mirnas. the remaining  <dig> mir loci were considered specific to pear. among these  <dig> loci,  <dig> loci produced mature mirnas of 21–22 nt , while others generated 23–24 nt mirnas. meanwhile, after removing known mirnas, the remaining 20–22 nt srna reads were subjected to the mircat pipeline using default parameters for plant mirna identification. a total of  <dig> mirna candidates were identified from the four libraries, of which  <dig> had mirna*  sequences identified from the same libraries, while the other  <dig> had no identified mirna* sequences . in total, we identified  <dig> candidates with mirna* , which were considered as pear-specific mirnas, and  <dig> candidates without mirna* sequences were considered as pear-specific mirna candidates. stem-loop structures of the predicted precursors of each pear specific mirnas were shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig> table  <dig> novel or candidate mirnas found in pear buda



aadditional file 4: figure s <dig> showed the stem-loop structure of the predicted precursors of each pear-specific mirnas


bpipeline that successfully identified the mirna loci



of the  <dig> pear-specific mirnas,  <dig> belonged to the 21 nt class of mirnas and  <dig> belonged to the 22 nt class, while the remaining three were 20 nt long . in general, the pear-specific mirnas were much less abundant than the conserved mirnas in our libraries. for example, in the endo <dig> dataset, only  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirnas yielded levels over  <dig> rpm, while  <dig> were below  <dig> rpm .

target genes were also identified for the  <dig> pear-specific mirnas. twenty-nine genes were identified as targets of  <dig> pear-specific mirnas . of the  <dig> target genes, two belonged to category  <dig>  three to category  <dig> and eight to category  <dig>  while all others were classified into category  <dig>  among these  <dig> genes, eight genes were successfully annotated by tair  <dig>  the target of mirn <dig> encoded gamma carbonic anhydrase-like  <dig>  while mirn <dig> targeted a nitrate transporter gene. in addition, mirn <dig> targeted polyubiquitin  <dig>  and mirn <dig> targeted an actin-related protein  <dig> . hence, these pear specific mirnas may be involved in the regulation of an array of metabolic and biological processes and signaling pathways. similar to previous reports, however, most of the pear-specific mirna targets fell into categories  <dig> or  <dig>  which represents a relatively low-confidence group and necessitates further experimental validation.table  <dig> target of pear-specific mirnas in pear identified by degradome sequencing



differential expression of srnas during endodormancy release
differential expression analysis of srnas was performed on two levels: individual sequences of mirnas and clusters annotated by shortstack. differential expression was defined as at least a 2-fold  or  <dig> -fold  change, with statistically significant difference between ecodormancy and endodormancy samples.

the differential expression analysis between endodormancy and ecodormancy stages of mirnas was performed using edger  <cit> . two-year samples of similar dormancy stages, judged by dvi values, were used as biological replicates. in our datasets, we did not observe any differentially expressive conserved mirna . furhtermore, we carried out qrt-pcr to confirm their expression patterns, and most of the mirna expression patterns were similar as that determined by the next-generation sequencing . in our work, the samples collected from two successive seasons allowed us to identify whether the mirnas were stably differential expressive through different years. as shown in fig.  <dig>  although some mirnas, e.g. mir <dig>  mir <dig>  significantly differential expressed between dvi  <dig>  and dvi  <dig>  in the 2009/ <dig> season, their expression patterns in the samples within the similar dormant stages in 2010/ <dig> season were totally different, suggesting that such differential expressions were not related to the dormant stage transition but to other reasons such as environmental changes and so on. in addition, the pear-specific mirnas were also analyzed, but none of them showed differential expression between endodormancy and ecodormancy buds .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of the expression of conserved mirnas. samples of  <dig> time points were used for analysis in the season of 2009/ <dig>  and only samples of  <dig> time points were analyzed in the season of 2010/ <dig>  due to the lack of enough samples. error bars indicate the standard deviation of three technical replicates. the date corresponding to endodormancy-release was marked with dash line



differential expression analysis of srna loci was also performed with edger. among the  <dig>  srna loci, a total of  <dig> differential expression loci were identified, of which  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in the ecodormancy stage . the imbalance between up- and down-regulated loci might suggest increased production of srnas in ecodormancy pear winter buds. as shown in fig. 7a, ~70 % of the differentially expressed loci belonged to the 23–24 nt group, while 30 % were categorized as 20–22 nt. in terms of structure,  <dig> differentially expressed loci were mir loci and  <dig> were hp loci, while the rest were non-hp loci . among these differential expressive loci,  <dig> loci were annotated as transposons and  <dig> loci overlapped with annotated transcripts, including  <dig> located in introns and  <dig> in exons . all  <dig> exon-overlapped loci were upregulated at ecodormancy. as the presence of exon-originated sirna suggested dcl-mediated cleavage of transcripts, the corresponding transcript abundances were analyzed using rna-seq data . as a result, the  <dig> exon-overlapped loci were found located in  <dig> genes, two of which showed significant upregulation at ecodormancy : pbr <dig> , similar to atbzip <dig>  and an un-annotatable gene pbr <dig> . the remaining genes were stably expressed near endodormancy release in both ‘kosui’ and ‘suli’ libraries .fig.  <dig> ma-plot of differential expression analysis of srna loci between endodormancy and ecodormancy. note that the up-regulated srna loci were much more that the down-regulated loci

identification of the multi-functional precursor of mir168
it has been shown that mir <dig> is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of ago <dig> in arabidopsis and other plant species  <cit> . in pear winter flower buds, we observed a similar cleavage event via pare-seq. however, this cleavage event was in category  <dig>  while second cleavage event, located 5 bp upstream and in category  <dig>  was mediated by an unknown 21 nt srna with two variants, between which there was a snp near the 3′ end. alignment with the known mir <dig> sequence showed that the 16 nt sequence at the 5′ end of the unknown srnas perfectly matched 16 nt at the 3′ end of mir <dig>  analysis of their precursors showed that the unknown srnas and mir <dig> derived from overlapping position within the same precursor, while differing in abundance . these results suggested that in pear, the mir <dig> precursor was able to produce multiple functional mature mirnas. we thus named the two mirnas mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . however, mir <dig>  was the major mir <dig> species in all four libraries, e.g., in the endo <dig> library, mir <dig>  and its mirna* account for over 80 % of srna produced from the precursor, while mir <dig>  accounts for only ~5 % . we found, though, that mir <dig>  dominantly mediated ago <dig> cleavage in pear winter buds . this was further confirmed by 5′-race ; in all nine independently sequenced colonies, the 5′ end corresponded to the cleavage site of position  <dig>  which was mediated by mir <dig> .fig.  <dig> identification of a multi-functional mirna precursor of mir <dig> in pear winter buds. a the secondary structure of the mir <dig> precursor. the regions producing mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  are indicated. b abundances of mir <dig> , mir <dig>  and their star sequences produced from the precursor. endo <dig> was used as the example. c the binding sites of mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  on two target transcripts. d t-plot indicated the cleavage events mediated by mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  based on the pare-seq. e cleavage sites mediated by mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . the rml-race were applied to confirm the cleavage events identified with pare-seq



identification of tas <dig> locus and the pha-sirna locus triggered by tas <dig> ta-sirna
in the present study, identification of pha-sirna was performed using shortstack, by implementing the pear genome sequences. in total,  <dig> phased clusters were predicted to be statistically significant. for further analysis,  <dig> loci with hairpin structure and  <dig> loci annotated as mirna precursors were excluded. among the remaining loci, we identified a tas <dig> locus  with two mir <dig> target sites with allan scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  . alignment of the tas <dig> locus with those of other plant species revealed conservation of the two target sites as well as a region for the production of arf-targeting ta-sirnas . the conserved tas3-derived pha-sirnas d <dig> and d <dig> and the pare data were subsequently submitted to the cleaveland pipeline. seven arf genes, and an unannotated gene , were identified as targets of d <dig> and d <dig> . interestingly, the upstream region of the d <dig> target site in pbr <dig>   was predicted as a phased locus . the fact that the primary cleavage was mediated by ta-sirna d <dig> suggested that this was not a case of mirna-mediated phasing process. therefore, the phased locus observed here may produce secondary sirnas through the rdr6-dcl <dig> pathway triggered by d <dig> pha-sirna.fig.  <dig> identification of tas <dig> locus and the target of tas3-sirnas. a comparison of pear tas <dig> locus with that of other plant species. b

discussion
next-generation sequencing has tremendously increased the ability for analysis of srna. to date, much research has focused on the identification and annotation of mirnas. however, the majority of expressed srnas are not mirnas. in arabidopsis, mirnas account for approximately 10 % of the genome. in pear winter buds, only  <dig> loci  were annotated as mirnas among a total of  <dig>  srna loci. because we used shortstack, which employs a relatively high stringent algorithm, to annotate mir loci, the actual number of mirna loci may be a bit larger; nonetheless, it was clear that a large number of srna loci were not mirnas. among these unannotated loci, hp loci represented a small portion. hp loci have long been used as a tool to manipulate plant mrna expression levels. unlike the loci that produce mirnas, srnas from hp loci are relatively evenly distributed among the sequences. to date, although a few endogenous hp loci have been characterized in detail, including arabidopsis ir <dig>  ir <dig>  <cit>  and maize mu killer  <cit> , these loci require further studies. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the majority of srna loci in the pear genome cannot form the hairpin structure ; these non-hp loci include pha-sirna loci and hc-sirna loci, among others. several phased loci, such as mir390-targeted tas <dig> loci and mir482-targeted nbs-lrr loci, are conserved among species. this work identified  <dig> phased loci, among which a conserved tas <dig> locus was identified. interestingly, ta-sirna generated from the tas <dig> locus further triggered the production of pha-sirnas in the upstream region of the target gene arf <dig>  recently, similar events have also been observed in soybean: transcripts of arf <dig> and arf <dig> were not only cleaved by ta-siarfs 7d and 8d, but the arf targets produced pha-sirnas  <cit> . thus, our work confirmed that sirnas can function as pha-sirna triggers, not only in solanaceae, but also in rosaceae.

the expression of conserved mirna differed among tissue and organs. previous reports identified apple mirna expression in various tissues  <cit> , comparison with which suggests distinct profile of mirna in pear winter buds. although xia et al.  <cit>  and the present work both used rpm to normalize raw reads for expression level, they used genome-mapped reads while we used total clean reads. it is therefore impossible to directly compare the absolute abundance of each mirna family. we alternatively compared the five most abundant mirna families in apple organs and pear winter buds. in pear, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were the most abundant srnas, followed by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  in apple organs, mir <dig> were relatively highly expressed in leaf and root and mir <dig> also showed relatively high expression in all tested organs except fruit. however, the mir <dig> family was not abundantly expressed in apple and mir <dig> showed similarly low expression, except in flower. such results suggested that mir <dig> and mir <dig> play specific roles in the development of winter buds. mir <dig> targets class ii tcp family transcription factors, which function in the coordination of cell proliferation, the differentiation of several morphological traits, the biosynthesis of phytohormons, as well as the regulation of circadian clock rhythms  <cit> . however, the roles of tcp genes in winter buds have not been well described. compared to other tissue/organs, the high abundance of mir <dig> suggested relatively low tcp expression, which is probably correlated with the active cell division observed in dormant buds, comparing to mature leaves in which cell division is limited to the area near the petiole. in arabidopsis, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are involved in auxin signaling via regulation of arf genes  <cit> . in japanese pear, we also identified seven and six arf encoding genes regulated by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively. in addition, a class of ta-sirnas, produced from the tas <dig> gene and triggered by mir <dig>  were also involved in arf gene regulation via mrna cleavage. in arabidopsis and wheat, arf maintains seed dormancy by stimulating the aba signal  <cit> . although the functions of auxin and arf on endodormancy have not yet been described in detail, the relatively high expression of arf-target mirnas, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  suggests their possible roles in the winter bud dormancy.

many of the previous reports on srna uses a single biological sample for differential expression analysis, potentially increasing the risk of false positive results. in our work, we analyzed the srnaome of samples from two successive seasons as biological replicates, allowing us greater confidence in the results of our differential expression analysis. differential expression analyses usually employ one of three strategies: i) individual sequences of interest, such as mirnas; ii) genomic elements, such as genes or transposons; or iii) discrete srna-generated genomic loci   <cit> . in this work, we employed two separate strategies: strategy i was applied to mirna analysis and strategy ii was applied to analyses of other srna loci.

during the preparation of our manuscript, niu et al.  <cit>  reported the analysis of the mirnas of chinese white pear during the endodormancy release. they found several mirnas that were differentially expressed during endodormancy release. specifically, they identified a pear-specific mirna mir <dig> that directly cleaved the transcript of ppdam <dig> gene, suggesting the post-transcriptional regulation of ppdam <dig>  however, neither the conserved mirnas nor the pear-specific mirnas were differentially expressed using samples of two successive seasons in our study. in addition, we did not found the mir <dig> in all our four datasets even we sequenced the srnaome in a relatively high depth. the reason for such differences is probably due to the different cultivars used in these two studies, suggesting that the functions of mirnas during endodormancy release may vary among pear cultivars.

in the  <dig> differentially expressed loci, over 80 % were upregulated after endodormancy release. considering that a similar phenomenon was observed for the rna-seq analysis using the same samples, these results might suggest universal transcriptional upregulation following endodormancy release. in total,  <dig> loci, all of which were upregulated in ecodormancy, were annotated as exons of  <dig> genes, suggesting their potential regulation of those genes. however, only two genes were identified as differentially expressed in endodormancy vs. ecodormancy. one of them encoded a bzip protein, while the other was not able to be annotated. the bzip protein is similar to arabidopsis atbzip <dig>  belonging to group c, which has an extended leucine zipper with up to nine heptad repeats. the function of atbzip <dig> has not yet been well characterized, but other members of group c were involved in regulation of seed storage protein production and responses to environmental or pathogen challenges. in the ‘kosui’ rna-seq libraries, the bzip <dig> gene was upregulated at ecodormancy, while in the chinese pear datasets high expression levels were observed in december and january. these results suggest a potential function of bzip <dig> in the regulation of endodormancy release.

there are several cases for which multiple mirnas accumulate from the same precursor, including cases where mirna and mirna* species accumulate to approximately equal levels, cases in which overlapping but distinct mirna species are produced from the same arm of a stem-loop, and cases where multiple mirna/mirna* duplexes are sequentially excised. in this work, we identified a novel mir <dig> mirna sequence which overlapped with the well-described mir <dig>  in accordance with the nomenclature proposed in meyers et al.  <cit> , we designated the original mir <dig> and novel mir <dig> in japanese pear as ppmir <dig>  and ppmir <dig> , respectively. a similar case was observed for arabidopsis mir <dig>  which targets the ppr gene family; the mir <dig> locus encodes two overlapping mirnas, mir <dig>  and mir <dig> , from a contiguous 29 nt sequence. considering the evolution of this type of mir locus, allen et al.  <cit>  proposed that the mir <dig> gene evolved relatively recently via an inverted duplication event associated with the active expansion of the target gene. the similar structure of pear mir <dig> suggests the same mechanisms of accumulation and evolution as those of arabidopsis mir <dig>  in pear, mir <dig>  was the dominant mature mirna, accounting for over 70 % of srna, while mir <dig>  accounted for only ~5 %. however, pare-seq showed that most cleavage events in the target gene ago <dig> were mediated by mir <dig>  but not by mir <dig> , possibly due to differences in minimum free energy required for forming a duplex between the mirna and the target mrna.

as mentioned above, mir <dig> triggered the production of ta-sirnas, which post-transcriptionally regulate arf genes. previous reports show reveal at least five tas <dig> loci in the apple genome  <cit> . despite pear belonging to the same genus as apple, our phased loci analysis found only one tas <dig> locus sharing high homology with apple tas3- <dig> genes. further blasting with core d <dig> and d <dig> sequences to pear genome sequences also matched only a single locus . we do not consider only one tas <dig> locus to be present in pear genome and attribute our result to the incomplete pear genome used in this study. in addition, the lack of pear est information also limited us to identified tas genes and other non-coding rnas. compared to apple, for which  <dig>  est fragments exist in the genbank est database, only  <dig> est fragments exist for pear , none of which correspond to the conserved tas locus. in contrast, four of five apple tas loci were identified from the est database  <cit> .

much work has reported identification of mirnas in new plant species. in this study, we used three pipelines  to annotate mirnas. mirprof uses similarity to search for matches while shortstack and mircat identify mirna sequences de novo. utilizing annotations of known mirnas, mirprof identified  <dig> mirnas belonging to  <dig> known mirna families, while shortstack identified only  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> families. although blast-based strategies are more sensitive for identification of known mirnas, they are unable to obtain information on mirna location and copy number in the genome and their sensitivity depends largely on the blast parameters chosen , especially for species with no information in mirbase. in contrast, the de novo strategies use a series of criteria to determine the probability of each srna and their accuracy depends on the stringency of the criteria used. in recent years, the criteria for mirna annotation have largely been changed. for example, most mirna precursors produce more than a single product , which are not able to be properly annotated using all three pipelines. therefore, it is necessary to develop a more robust algorithm for plant mirna annotation.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> conserved or less conserved mirnas and  <dig> pear-specific mirnas. however, none of the conserved micrornas or pear-specific mirnas was differentially expressed between endodormancy and ecodormancy stages at least in this study. on the contrast,  <dig> of  <dig>  loci that produced srnas were differentially expressed between endodormancy and ecodormancy. we also characterized a multifunctional mirna precursor mir <dig> and we showed that sirnas are able to trigger phased sirnas in pear like reported in other plant species. our work showed that dormancy release is a highly coordinated physiological process involving the regulation of srnas.
