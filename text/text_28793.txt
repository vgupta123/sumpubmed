BACKGROUND
mammals can detect and discriminate many thousands of odorous molecules in our environments using millions of neurons in the olfactory epithelium. these neurons express members of one of the largest gene families in the mammalian genome, the olfactory receptors   <cit> . in mouse, this gene family comprises ~ <dig> apparently functional genes and ~ <dig> pseudogenes  <cit>  . as a result of the gene family's ongoing expansion by tandem duplication, most mouse ors are found in the genome in clusters of up to ~ <dig> genes with orfs spaced ~ <dig> kb apart on average  <cit> . although some clear one-to-one orthologs can be identified across species, extensive post-speciation duplication has resulted in many ors having one-to-many or many-to-many orthologous relationships. phylogenetic trees show that ors can be divided into two major classes, class i and class ii ors  <cit>  . while the ligands recognized by most mouse ors remain unknown, available odorant-response profiles suggest that class i ors recognize odorants that are more hydrophilic than those recognized by class ii  <cit> .

each neuron in the olfactory epithelium expresses only one member of the or gene family; furthermore, only one of the two parental alleles of the selected or is expressed in each cell  <cit> . individual or genes are therefore expressed in only a small subset of the neurons of the olfactory epithelium. this "singular" mode of expression ensures that different neurons respond to different odorants and that a distinct pattern of neuronal activation is generated for each odorant, thereby allowing for perceptual discrimination. neurons expressing a given or tend to be confined to one of five regions of the olfactory epithelium   <cit> , although recent studies suggest that these zones are less clearly defined than previously thought and can partially overlap  <cit> . each cell's choice among the set of "zone-appropriate" ors appears to be stochastic  <cit> . however, some ors are expressed in many more cells and/or at higher per-cell levels than others  <cit> , implying that some ors may have "stronger" promoters than others.

transgene studies have shown that a small region of a few hundred base pairs upstream of the or transcription start site  can act as a minimal promoter to drive transcription of a reporter construct in a pattern that seems mostly faithful to that of the endogenous gene, although occasional differences are observed in zonal restriction of transgenes  <cit> . it therefore seems reasonable to expect that regions close to the tss will contain functional sequence motifs involved in transcriptional activation of or genes. one might expect the existence of transcription factors common to all ors and/or transcription factors specific for different subsets of ors, perhaps those expressed in certain zones of the olfactory epithelium, or certain phylogenetic subfamilies such as class i or class ii ors.

two classes of transcription factors have been identified that appear important in or activation: the o/e family and homeodomain proteins. binding sites for o/e and homeodomain proteins have been identified in many or promoter regions, both experimentally and using bioinformatic methods  <cit> . the o/e family comprises four helix-loop-helix  transcription factors that are expressed throughout the olfactory epithelium: o/e- <dig> , o/e- <dig>  o/e- <dig> and o/e- <dig>  <cit> . the four family members appear to have similar dna recognition specificities and may form heterodimers with one another. the pattern of expression in non-olfactorytissues differs between the four o/e family members, as does their strength of transcriptional activation  <cit> . mice lacking o/e- <dig>  o/e- <dig> or o/e- <dig> die prematurely; their olfactory epithelia appear normal on a gross level, but the projection of olfactory neurons to the brain appears disrupted, perhaps implying subtle shifts in the expression pattern of o/e target genes, including ors  <cit> . the o/e family members exhibit at least partial redundancy with one another  <cit> . a zinc-finger protein, roaz, might interact with o/e family members, perhaps preventing them from acting as transcriptional activators  <cit> .

two homeodomain proteins are known to be involved in or regulation: lhx <dig> and emx <dig>  the lim-homeodomain protein lhx <dig> was first identified as an olfactory transcription factor by virtue of its binding to the promoter region of one or, m <dig>  <cit> . studies of mice mutant for lhx <dig> show that it is important for transcription of all class ii ors but not most class i ors  <cit> . notably, the two class i ors that were tested whose expression is affected in lhx <dig> knockout mice are normally expressed in a dorsal region of the olfactory epithelium along with class ii ors, whereas the unaffected class i genes are normally expressed in a more ventral region  <cit> . lhx <dig> itself is expressed throughout the olfactory epithelium, most strongly in neuronal precursor cells  <cit> . a second homeodomain protein, emx <dig>  has also been implicated in or transcriptional control. it also binds the m <dig> promoter and is expressed throughout the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . most or genes show dramatically reduced transcript levels in emx <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . a third homeodomain protein, dlx <dig>  is important for proper olfactory neuron axon targeting  <cit> ; one possible explanation is that it is involved in or regulation, although or expression has not been examined in dlx <dig> mutant mice.

although candidate activation signals common to most or all ors have been identified, the singular mode of expression has not yet been fully explained despite extensive efforts. an enhancer-like element, the "h region" is required for transcription of its neighboring ors and might act as a locus control region  to select a single gene for expression from the nearby or cluster  <cit> . the h region also shows nuclear co-localization with promoters of actively transcribed ors on other chromosomes  <cit> , leading to the hypothesis that the h region could also act as an enhancer/lcr in trans for ors throughout the genome  <cit> . however, experiments in mice in which the h region is deleted show that, while it is essential for transcription of nearby ors, it appears dispensable for the transcription of more distant ors and ors on other chromosomes  <cit> . a negative-feedback mechanism might partially explain the singular mode of expression; once an or is chosen for expression , negative feedback seems to operate to prevent transcription from other or loci, a mechanism that might involve the or protein-coding region to send and/or receive repressive  <cit> . another attractive hypothesis that had been proposed to explain singular expression is somatic recombination into an active locus, analogous to the role of recombination in generating lymphocyte diversity and singular expression of t-cell receptors and immunoglobulins. however, elegant nuclear transfer experiments show that recombination is very unlikely to play a role in or gene choice  <cit> . recently published work has shown that epigenetic marks may play a key role in the mechanism of or silencing and expression  <cit> .

the goal of the present study is to perform rigorous statistical and bioinformatics analyses on or promoter regions in an attempt to identify additional common dna sequence motifs that might function in positive or negative transcriptional control of the gene family. experimental studies of or regulation are inherently difficult, because cells expressing each or are rare  and dispersed throughout a relatively small tissue. bioinformatic studies could therefore be a useful complementary tool. a previous study  <cit>  used ab initio motif-identification tools on  <dig> mouse or promoters to show that motifs similar to o/e and homeodomain sites are enriched in or promoters. our study greatly extends this earlier work, adding large-scale examination of databases of known transcription factor binding sites and the powerful tool of comparative genomics, as well as using a larger dataset of more than  <dig> or promoter sequences.

the identification of functionally important sequences in a set of promoter regions of interest using bioinformatic methods is a difficult task, largely due to issues of poor signal-to-noise ratio. transcription factors tend to recognize short and often degenerate sequences, making it difficult to identify over-represented candidate binding sites using so-called ab initio motif-finding methods. this degeneracy also makes it difficult to scan a genomic sequence using known motifs and computationally distinguish true binding sites from false positives. an increasing number of studies  have harnessed the power of comparative genomics to help sift signal from noise. sequences that are functionally important are often conserved during evolution, acquiring mutations at a slower rate than non-functional sequences, and can thus be recognized in multi-species alignments as regions with fewer sequence changes than expected given the phylogenetic relationship between the species studied  <cit> . until now, comparative sequence analysis has not been applied in a systematic way to a large collection of or promoters.

together, the approaches we describe here provide a rigorous and thorough examination of enriched and conserved sequences in promoters of the or gene family. we found strong evidence supporting the importance of the o/e family of transcription factors, homeodomain factors and tata boxes but found no additional enriched common sequence motifs, indicating that experimental approaches are more likely to yield the next breakthrough in the field of or transcriptional regulation.

RESULTS
general characteristics of or promoter regions
in order to detect signals in nucleotide sequences that might be important in controlling or transcription, we needed a dataset of well-defined or transcription start sites . ors typically have intronless protein-coding regions, but their 5' untranslated regions  usually contain introns  <cit> . the genomic locations of the 5' exons, introns and tsss cannot easily be predicted computationally nor derived from high-throughput est or cage experiments, which have overlooked or transcripts due to issues of tissue availability and transcript abundance. targeted approaches have therefore been necessary to yield locations of upstream exons, tsss and promoters for the or genes and have been performed almost exclusively using mouse tissues.

michaloski et al. performed 5'-race for  <dig> mouse ors; sequences obtained from these race products can be mapped to the mouse genome assembly to yield putative locations for the corresponding tsss and promoters  <cit> . we also collected 5'-race data from various other studies of smaller numbers of ors . in addition, we previously performed a hybridization-based cdna library screen to identify putative tsss for more than  <dig> ors  <cit> . a potential concern of using cdna-defined tsss is that some cdnas in the library may not be full-length. examination of the  <dig> ors for which both race-defined and cdna-defined tsss are available shows that est completeness is not a major concern; in 57/ <dig>  cases the est- and race-defined tsss map within  <dig> bp of one another. in the remaining  <dig> cases the race sequence race data imply a tss further upstream than the est sequence in  <dig> of those  <dig> ors, but for the other  <dig>  est sequences extend further upstream. for an or gene where different methods or cdna clones imply different tss locations, it is quite possible that several alternate start sites truly exist, as has been observed for many genes  <cit> ; however, it is also possible that some of the sequenced clones are not full-length. we have therefore taken the conservative approach of analyzing only the most upstream tss predicted for each gene. combining all the data sources mentioned above, we can define putative tss locations for  <dig> intact ors , which represents more than one-third of the  <dig> intact or genes we find in the july  <dig> version of the mouse genome assembly . only  <dig> of these  <dig> genes are class i ors , whereas  <dig> are class ii ors. this primer bias means that the statistical tests we describe below will be more powerful for class ii ors than for class i ors and make comparisons between those two groups difficult.

some or genes are the products of relatively recent genomic duplications involving a stretch of genomic dna that can include the promoter region  <cit> . it is important for the statistical validity of many of the analyses we describe below to include only one member of any group of recent gene/promoter duplicates, so that  a transcription factor binding site observed in similar locations in multiple promoter sequences is likely to be regionally over-represented due to functional considerations, rather than because those promoters share much of their sequence due to recent duplication . therefore, we applied an additional filtering step to the promoter dataset to ensure that it contained no pairs of recently duplicated ors . after such filtering, our promoter dataset contained  <dig> putative or tsss, comprising  <dig> class i ors and  <dig> class ii ors. although these tss locations might include a minority that are defined imprecisely or perhaps even wrongly, in order to keep the following text as clear as possible, we have omitted the words "putative", "candidate", etc., each time we refer to the tsss we have analyzed. we performed our analyses on two alternative datasets of regions:  the 200-bp region immediately preceding these tsss, because many of the functional elements important for transcription should be found close to the tss  <cit>  and motif searches should be more powerful with smaller sequence sets; and  a larger 500-bp region immediately preceding the tsss, because it is possible that the biologically active promoter region might be larger than 200bp for some fraction of the ors. we refer to these 200-bp or 500-bp regions below as "promoters" for simplicity, although this is surely a very rough approximation to the true promoter regions.

these  <dig> tsss are  <dig>  kb away from their corresponding translational start sites on average . figure 1a shows that repeat content drops dramatically approaching the predicted tsss; fewer than 2% of bases in the last  <dig> bp before these tsss are recognized by repeatmasker as repetitive elements. in contrast, cross-species conservation scores rise approaching the tss . these patterns of repeat content and conservation scores indicate that the majority of the candidate tsss are indeed likely to be real. considering the  <dig> kb centered at the tss, the gc content of the or promoter regions averages  <dig> %, much lower than the genome-wide average for mouse of ~42%  <cit> . the rise and dip in gc content very close to the tss  is partly, but not entirely, due to the high frequency of gc-rich o/e sites and at-rich tata boxes in those regions . no predicted cpg islands lie within  <dig> kb of any of these  <dig> tsss. if we analyze class i and class ii ors separately, these patterns of gc content, repeat content, conservation score and o/e and tata-box enrichment hold for both classes ; unfortunately not enough tsss are defined for class i genes to rigorously test for differences in the enrichment levels between classes.

o/e sites and tata boxes are enriched in or promoters
we scanned the promoter sequences using a collection of position weight matrices  representing known transcription factor binding sites. several such databases and search algorithms exist; we chose to use the matbase database and the corresponding matinspector search program  <cit>  . as discussed above, most transcription factor binding sites recognize short, degenerate sequence motifs, and methods for scanning genomic sequences for pwm matches suffer from signal-to-noise problems. most search algorithms score every position of a genomic sequence for its similarity to the pwm, and then take matches exceeding a certain score threshold as candidate transcription factor binding sites. matinspector's default parameters use an optimized score threshold for each pwm that is designed to minimize false positives  in order to maximize the proportion of predicted sites that represent true positive calls. although this approach is appropriate in some studies , minimizing false positives inevitably also results in a high false-negative rate. in other situations, it might be more important to minimize false negatives, such that a less stringent threshold might be appropriate. our study is one such situation: the veracity of individual sites is less important, because statistical methods will be used to select motifs that are enriched across multiple promoters. we therefore scanned the promoter sequences using matinspector's less stringent score threshold  as well as its optimized score threshold . for some matrices, like those representing o/e , the reduced stringency results appear useful, as many more sites are detected close to the tss without a high level of background noise further from the promoter sequence. however, for other matrices, like those representing the tata-box, the background level is prohibitively high when the score threshold is reduced .

the matbase database groups related pwms into families to simplify interpretation of results . for every pwm family, we plotted the spatial distribution of predicted binding sets near tsss in our dataset. we first examined the distribution of matches to matbase's v$nolf family, which comprises two similar matrices representing binding sites for the o/e family of transcription factors  <cit> , both of which are fairly long  and quite specific. as expected  <cit> , we find a clear peak of enrichment of o/e sites close to the predicted tsss . cross-species conservation analysis indicates that most o/e sites predicted even using matinspector's less stringent parameters are conserved . thus, for this matrix family, the opt- <dig>  predictions yield a better true-positive rate than the default opt predictions and still do not suffer from a high false-positive rate. in order to estimate the number of real o/e sites, we used cross-species conservation to filter matinspector's opt- <dig>  o/e predictions . we find that  <dig> of the  <dig> 200-bp promoters examined  contain a conserved o/e site in the  <dig> bp closest to the tss; many promoters contain more than one such site .

we also noticed a clear peak of enrichment of o$vtbp-family matrix matches very close to the predicted transcription start sites . o$vtbp matrices represent the vertebrate tata box and are short and quite degenerate. this degeneracy results in a large number of background matches, making the number of truly functional sites difficult to estimate. considering just the - <dig> to - <dig> region , matinspector calls an "opt" o$vtbp site for 39% of the promoters in our set; however, there is a non-trivial rate of finding these sites in other parts of the promoter region. although we cannot determine what proportion of or promoters contain a functional tata-box, such sequences are clearly enriched near or tsss. previous studies have classified or promoters as being mostly tata-less  <cit> , but the enrichment we observe indicates that tata boxes are likely used in at least a subset of or promoters.

statistical tests reveal a number of transcription factors whose binding sites are enriched in or promoters
we examined similar plots of spatial distributions for predicted binding sites of all other pwm families in the matbase database. some show enrichment close to the tss, but to a lower level than was observed for o/e. in order to assess the statistical significance of enrichment for each matrix family, we performed two statistical tests comparing the number of predicted sites observed in the  <dig> bp preceding the tss with the number of sites found in two types of "negative-control" sequences . our first test looks for enrichment compared to a nearby region; we used a binomial test to compare the number of predicted sites in the  <dig> bp upstream of the tss with the number in the preceding 200-bp region . for example, for v$nolf at the "opt- <dig> " stringency, we find  <dig> matches in the  <dig> bp preceding the tsss of the  <dig> non-redundant ors, but only  <dig> matches in the preceding  <dig> bp, representing ~ <dig> -fold enrichment. a one-tailed binomial test tells us that the likelihood of observing such extreme skew by chance is < 10- <dig> .

results of our statistical tests for enrichment and conservation are provided for selected matrix families before and after masking o/e sites and tata boxes. before masking, we provide results only for selected matrix families that we discuss in the text. after masking, we provide results for any matrix family that appeared statistically significant in all three tests before applying the bonferroni correction for multiple testing. additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> give results for all matrix families, as well as for all individual matrices. additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> give results of analogous tests for 500-bp putative promoter regions. p-values provided here are not corrected for multiple testing, but in selecting matrices for further discussion we used the conservative bonferroni correction. for each matrix family, we provide the description from matbase, using the abbreviation tf for transcription factor. we also provide the consensus sequence  of an arbitrarily chosen matrix from each family.

the "significance level" column summarizes the results of the three statistical tests in the following order:  enrichment versus previous 200-bp region  enrichment versus shuffled sequences  conservation scores versus surrounding nucleotides, counting whichever of the sites test or the cores test proved more significant . the "." symbol indicates not significant; the "+" symbol indicates significance level of p < =  <dig>  before applying bonferroni correction; and the "x" symbol indicates that the p-value remains significant after applying the bonferroni correction.

in the second test, we shuffled each 200-bp promoter sequence, maintaining its mono- and di-nucleotide composition . we performed matinspector scans on the  <dig> shuffled sequences and compared the number of matches found for each pwm family in the true promoters with the number found in their shuffled counterparts. we repeated this process with  <dig>  datasets of shuffled sequences. the proportion of shuffled sets in which we saw an equal or higher number of predicted transcription factor  binding sites as seen in the real data provides an estimate of how likely the observed number of matrix matches would be seen by chance in sequence of similar nucleotide composition. comparison of the number of predicted sites in real sequences with the mean number of predicted sites in the shuffled sets gives an estimate of the enrichment level. for example, there are  <dig> matches to v$nolf family matrices  in the  <dig> bp upstream of the tss in the real promoter set; in  <dig>  shuffled versions of the same dataset, there are on average  <dig>  v$nolf sites . this method therefore estimates ~ <dig> -fold enrichment . because none of the  <dig>  shuffled datasets contained as many predicted v$nolf sites as the real promoters, we estimate the chance of seeing  <dig> matches by chance as being < 1/ <dig>   .

although the o/e motif is significantly enriched according to both tests, the observed tata-box enrichment  is significant only when compared to shuffled sequences  and not by the binomial test comparing the 200-bp promoters to the preceding 200-bp regions . in fact, there are fewer sites in the  <dig> bp upstream of the tsss  than in the preceding  <dig> bp . this observation illustrates two limitations of our tests:  comparing a region as large as  <dig> bp may be insensitive when true enrichment peaks are more narrowly localized, and  the fluctuation in gc-content approaching the or-tsss can affect background levels of some motifs, especially short, degenerate at-rich  motifs. in the tata-box case, enrichment at ~-60bp to ~-10bp is balanced by slight depletion in other parts of the 200-bp region due to raised gc-content.

both tests initially highlighted some potentially interesting candidate transcription factors as being statistically significantly enriched even after a conservative bonferroni correction for multiple testing . one example is the v$ikrs matrix family representing binding sites for the ikaros family ; these sites have been previously noted in some or promoters  <cit> . however, upon closer examination, we find that the binding matrices for ikaros are rather similar to those for o/e. although it is possible that additional factors like ikaros do bind o/e sites, perhaps even in a competitive manner with o/e factors, it seems likely that the apparent enrichment of ikaros binding sites is merely a consequence of the presence of many true o/e motifs and the sequence similarity between these motifs. in order to search for matrices that are enriched independently of o/e and tata sites, we masked those predicted motifs from the promoter sequences and repeated our analyses, applying similar masks to the control sets used for our statistical tests in order to ensure that the same amount of sequence was scanned in real and control sets .

after masking o/e sites and tata boxes,  <dig> matrix families appear significantly enriched by one or both of the tests we describe above, even after applying a conservative bonferroni correction . none is enriched to as high a level as o/e sites, but these  <dig> matrix families are nonetheless found in or promoters significantly more frequently than expected. we would not necessarily expect more dramatic levels of enrichment than those observed, given that many matrix families are quite degenerate and yield high background levels of false-positive predictions as well as true positives. below we discuss the candidate transcription factors revealed by our enrichment analysis, but first we describe parallel analyses of evolutionary conservation in the or promoters.

we also performed all the tests described above on larger promoter regions of  <dig> bp . we obtained very similar results as we did for the 200-bp promoter regions .

some transcription factor binding sites show orthologous conservation
functionally important dna sequences are often evolutionarily conserved, and therefore analysis of aligned orthologous sequences can help identify such regions  <cit> . or promoters are no exception: sequences near or tsss show increased conservation compared to their surroundings . we sought to dissect the or promoter regions further to determine whether binding sites for any specific transcription factors accounted for this increased conservation.

we did so by examining conservation scores at the base-pair level to determine whether predicted binding sites for each transcription factor are more conserved than surrounding sequences. this analysis would be difficult for small numbers of promoter sequences, but the size of our promoter dataset gives us the statistical power to perform such analyses. for each of the or promoter regions, we obtained multiz/tba sequence alignments of candidate orthologous sequences from up to  <dig> placental mammals via the ucsc genome browser. we then used the scone algorithm  <cit>  to estimate the strength of evolutionary conservation at each position of the multiple-sequence alignment. for each pwm family, we examined whether or not conservation within predicted binding sites is higher than that outside the sites  . we find that o/e sites  show statistically significantly higher conservation than the remaining bases .

applying the same statistical test to each of the other matrix families in matbase, we again initially see significant results for ikaros and other matrices that share similarity with o/e sites. after masking out o/e sites and vtbp sites and re-applying the statistical tests, we find that  <dig> matrix families have significantly higher conservation scores  in cores and/or full sites than surrounding nucleotides, considering matinspector's default predictions . again, analyzing 500-bp promoter regions instead of 200-bp regions yields very similar set of significant factors.

although predicted tata boxes show a clear peak of enrichment close to the tss, they are not more conserved than surrounding nucleotides. this finding might be due to the short, degenerate nature of this motif  and/or might reveal some limitations of this test: if the collection of predicted sites being tested contains a large number of false-positive sites  as well as truly functional sites, the higher conservation scores of real sites would be diluted out by the lower scores of the false-positive sites. the statistical test also has lower power on shorter sites like the tata box  than on longer sites, and conservation will be less impressive for factors that can bind a variety of related sequences  than those that require a more exact match.

therefore we used another method to show that or promoters in other species also appear enriched for tata boxes. we used cross-species whole-genome alignments to obtain datasets of candidate orthologous or promoter regions from other mammalian species via ucsc's liftover utility, which translates coordinates in one genome assembly  to orthologous coordinates in other assemblies . we examined various characteristics of these "lifted over" promoter regions in several other species and see, in each species examined, similar characteristic patterns of repeat content dips and gc content fluctuations near the predicted tss as seen for the mouse or promoters, indicating that at least a majority of the lifted-over promoters are likely to be functional promoters . upon running matinspector on the orthologous promoter sets, we also observe enrichment of predicted o/e binding sites and tata boxes. this analysis demonstrates that tata boxes are frequently found close to orthologous tsss, even though they might not conserved in exactly the same location in other species.

all three statistical tests show the importance of o/e and homeodomain sites
as described above, o/e sites are statistically significantly enriched in or promoters compared to two sets of background sequences and show statistically significant evolutionary conservation compared to other nucleotides in the or promoter. after masking o/e sites and tata boxes, fifteen pwm families show significant results in all three tests when default matinspector parameters are used. impressively, eight pwm families are significant in all three tests even after applying the conservative bonferroni correction for multiple testing . all eight of those pwm families represent homeobox transcription factors ; their enrichment and conservation likely reflect the importance of binding sites for homeodomain proteins lhx <dig> and emx <dig>  in or promoters  <cit> . many of the other homeobox matrices showing significant enrichment have similar consensus sequences to the matrices for lhx <dig> and emx <dig>  as discussed above for ikaros and the o/e factors, bioinformatic analyses cannot distinguish whether homeobox factors in addition to lhx <dig> and emx <dig> are involved in or transcriptional activation, or whether the observed enrichment of additional homeobox matrices is simply due to the high similarity between matrices.

we were curious about the non-homeodomain factors shown by our analyses to be both enriched and evolutionarily conserved. in order to determine which individual factors might be important, we extended our analysis in two ways:  we examined enrichment/conservation for individual position weight matrices  rather than for matrix families , and  we examined genome-wide expression datasets to determine which of the enriched/conserved factors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium. in more detail, we performed similar analyses to those described above, but using matinspector's option to report results for individual position weight matrices. as expected, for each family that was significant in our original analyses , one or more individual matrices also show significant enrichment and/or conservation. in many cases, a majority of matrices in the family show significant results in one or more tests; this is expected given the similarity of the matrices. where possible, we determined gene symbols for the corresponding transcription factor for any individual matrix showing significant enrichment and conservation. we then used those gene symbols to look up expression levels according to rna-seq data generated from mature olfactory neurons and a mix of their progenitors and immature neurons  <cit> , considering factors expressed at high levels in either cell type to be of preliminary interest.

lhx <dig>  emx <dig> and the four o/e factors all stand out clearly when we combine expression data with our enrichment and conservation analyses . in addition to these known factors, the most tantalizing candidate is nhlh <dig> . nhlh <dig> is represented by a matrix in the v$hand family that shows modest yet statistically significant enrichment and conservation . one of the two individual matrices for nhlh <dig>  also shows significant enrichment and conservation when tested alone . rna-seq data show that nhlh <dig> is expressed at high levels in the immature neuron/progenitor cell population , but only very modestly in mature olfactory neurons . we also investigated publically available microarray expression data using the biogps interface  <cit> ; these data indicate even higher levels of nhlh <dig> in the vomeronasal organ  than in the main olfactory epithelium  and show that nhlh <dig> is expressed at higher levels in moe and vno than in a wide range of other tissues surveyed. previous studies have implicated nhlh <dig> in the genesis of gnrh- <dig> neurons  <cit> , which are born in the olfactory placode and migrate to the brain. extensive further experimental studies would be needed to determine whether nhlh <dig> has a role in or regulation as our bioinformatic tests could suggest, or whether the expression data simply reflect the presence of gnrh- <dig> precursors among the cells assayed.

ab initio motif discovery algorithms find o/e and homeodomain-like motifs, but no other motifs
as a complementary approach, we performed ab initio motif detection on the or promoter sequences. many algorithms exist for this difficult task, and none achieves it perfectly. tompa et al.  <cit>  discuss the challenges of motif detection and compare the performance of various algorithms. no program tested found all of the motif instances planted in the sequences ; motif-level accuracy is likely better but was not reported. no algorithm was a clear winner, and those tested appear to have different and sometimes complementary strengths and weaknesses. we decided to use three of the algorithms, meme  <cit> , weeder  <cit>  and motifsampler  <cit>  to search for novel motifs in or promoters . although we have not tested every possible algorithm on our sequences, the use of three different tools should provide a reasonable chance of detection. however, short, degenerate and/or relatively rare motifs are unlikely to be detectable by any ab initio motif detection algorithm, so a truly comprehensive analysis may never be possible.

on the 200-bp promoter sequences, weeder identifies several o/e-like motifs and several homeodomain-like motifs. meme identifies a very common motif similar to o/e binding sites, as well as some other marginally significant motifs, including some with weaker similarity to the o/e matrices ; however, meme does not report homeodomain-like motif enrichment. motifsampler yields a similar set of enriched o/e-like motifs but no homeodomain motifs.

on the 500-bp promoter sequences, weeder identifies only homeodomain-like motifs but not the striking o/e-like motif, whereas meme and motifsampler find an enriched o/e-like motif but no enrichment of homeodomain-like sequences.

we repeated the motif searches after masking o/e and vtbp sites as we did for our enrichment analyses above ; weeder continues to find homeodomain-like motifs; motifsampler now identifies homeodomain-like motifs, showing that thorough masking of the most common motif can assist in the identification of secondary motifs. however, meme reports no remaining statistically significant motifs.

we investigated why meme and motifsampler were less effective than weeder at identifying homeodomain-like motifs on the unmasked promoters. we explored various parameter choices for meme and motifsampler and found that the choice of "background model" is influential. when we use a background model derived from 1-kb promoter regions from all known tsss in the mouse genome , meme recovers homeodomain-like motifs  in addition to o/e-like motifs. when we use a background model supplied by the authors of motifsampler that was generated from mouse intergenic sequences, we find homeodomain but not o/e-like motifs. however, using our first choice of what seems like a statistically more appropriate choice of background model given the unusual gc content of or promoters , we found no homeodomain-like motifs. in other words, at-rich motifs are statistically not very surprising in at-rich sequences, but are surprising in sequences of genome-wide average gc content. we note that weeder uses a background model derived from all 1-kb promoter regions . this discrepancy highlights the difficulty of choosing appropriate parameters for motif identification algorithms.

we also used a smaller dataset consisting of evolutionarily conserved promoter subregions as input to meme, because ab initio motif-identification algorithms like meme should do better on input datasets that are more enriched in true functional elements. we used phastcons elements  <cit>  present in our or promoter dataset to define such conserved subregions. the phastcons program uses a hidden markov model to classify regions of multiple sequence alignments into two states: conserved or neutrally evolving. considering the  <dig> bp before the tss,  <dig> of the  <dig> non-redundant or promoters contain a total of  <dig> placental mammal phastcons elements, comprising  <dig> % of the basepairs of the promoter regions tested. we eliminated three very short conserved elements , and used the remaining  <dig> sequences  as input to the meme algorithm. the only statistically significant motif found is again similar to o/e motifs. meme reports  <dig> instances of this motif in  <dig> of the subsequences, totaling  <dig> bp, or an impressive 25% of the basepairs of the phastcons elements used as input.

we also performed meme analysis on various functionally and phylogenetically defined subsets of the or promoters, reasoning that some subsets of ors might share sequence motifs that are not common to the entire or family, and that analysis of these subsets might reveal motifs that would otherwise be diluted out in the larger, more heterogeneous dataset. the functionally defined subsets we tested include ors expressed in the same zone of the olfactory epithelium as one another, ors expressed in the septal organ, ors whose promoter regions have been shown to interact with the h-region, and ors for which there is evidence of expression in the vomeronasal epithelium. we also selected phylogenetically defined subsets using either the mor family categorization  <cit>  or horde family assignments  <cit>  or only class i ors. upon running meme on these subsets, we find o/e-like motifs in almost all cases, demonstrating that meme has the power to find enriched motifs even with very small promoter datasets . however, after masking o/e motifs, we find almost no significant motifs using meme in any of the sequence subsets, similar to our findings for the larger sequence dataset . the very few statistically significant motifs we do find were rather long and very degenerate, and thus difficult to interpret whether they have any biological significance. similar analyses using weeder yielded enriched homeodomain-like motifs in many of the subsets searched, but we did not pick out any common novel enriched motifs among those reported by weeder. the motifs detected by motifsampler on these smaller datasets were all rather degenerate and thus it is difficult to interpret whether they are biologically significant.

discussion
we have performed rigorous analyses of a large dataset of mouse olfactory receptor promoter regions looking for enriched sequence motifs that might be involved in transcriptional control of this gene family. our approach combines three statistical tests that deal with issues of signal-to-noise levels that are often problematic when searching promoters with collections of known pwms. these three tests determine whether or not motifs  are enriched in candidate promoter regions relative to the immediately preceding region,  are enriched in or promoters compared to shuffled sequences, and  are more evolutionarily conserved than neighboring sequences. we found strong statistical evidence that o/e and homeodomain factors are important in or transcriptional regulation, agreeing with previous experimental results and with a previous, more limited, bioinformatics search  <cit> . these results demonstrate that our approach is well designed and effective. however, our analysis revealed no convincing novel candidate transcription factors, suggesting that experimental approaches might have already been successful in uncovering all factors common to the majority of the or family.

our analysis focused on either the 200-bp or 500-bp regions immediately upstream of the transcription start site; a 200-bp region appears sufficient to direct appropriate transcription of transgene reporter constructs for the very limited number of or promoters tested  <cit> . however, it is also possible that some ors might contain functionally important motifs in other regions, perhaps further upstream of the tss, in the first intron, 5' utr, orf, and/or in the 3' utr. it is intriguing that olfactory tissues express over  <dig> micrornas and that some appear to be necessary as precursor cells differentiate into mature olfactory neurons  <cit> . although outside the scope of this study, our statistical approach could also be applied to search for enriched microrna target sites. a search for dna- or rna-based signals residing in the orf region would also be interesting, but would require different analysis methods that account for the fact that orfs are constrained by the need to encode functional proteins  and for variation in conservation levels in different regions of the protein.

our careful approach highlights some potential pitfalls of the bioinformatic analysis of gene regulation, especially in gene families that include recent duplicates. to ensure independence in statistical tests, we realized it was important to include only one representative of any pair of recently duplicated promoter sequences in any analysis, as false-positive matrix matches would be highly correlated among duplicates and could give false signs of enrichment. we also note that it is difficult to distinguish between transcription factors with similar binding sites  and that sequential rounds of analysis can be helpful, masking out sites for the top hit before repeating statistical tests.

despite our efforts to perform a thorough computational analysis, a bioinformatic approach naturally has many limitations. one of the main issues is that pwms defining tf binding sites are usually short and quite degenerate, meaning that the matrix will match at many "false positive" locations in addition to true binding sites. furthermore, pwms for different tfs have different levels of signal-to-noise, meaning that no single score threshold or filtering strategy is appropriate for all pwms. very degenerate binding sites are particularly difficult to detect as enriched: comparison between our observations for o/e and tata boxes demonstrates this issue clearly. atypical motifs  are also difficult to identify. in vivo, local chromatin structure, epigenetic modifications, dna accessibility, indirect regulation via protein-protein interactions, and perhaps even sub-nuclear localization are likely to be crucial in allowing a transcription factor to act only at the "correct" sites, even if it would be able to bind most predicted sites on isolated dna in vitro.

we note that our use of the bonferroni correction and the requirement that a factor be recognized by all three tests is a conservative approach - additional pwms that do not meet formal significance criteria might also be truly enriched and functionally important. indeed, some motifs  might show enrichment in orthologous promoter sets when analyzed independently but fail to show higher conservation scores in multiple sequence alignments because the exact location of the binding site can shift during evolution  <cit> . our three statistical tests used a database of transcription factors whose binding sites are known; such databases are almost certainly incomplete. however, our complementary analysis using the ab initio motif-identification algorithm meme revealed a very similar set of enriched motifs as we found using the matbase database as a starting point. this observation argues that totally novel factors are unlikely to regulate or promoters unless they recognize very degenerate sequences, which no current bioinformatic approach can detect.

finally, some members of the or gene family are expressed outside of the olfactory epithelium as well as in the nose, for example in mouse muscle cells or human testis  <cit> , leaving open the interesting possibility that some ors have been co-opted during evolution to perform new functions. careful bioinformatic and experimental analysis of promoters of ors expressed in other tissues could reveal recently arisen transcription factor binding sites that allow novel regulatory control in non-olfactory tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses confirm the functional relevance of o/e and homeodomain binding sites across the or family and suggest that there are no other well-conserved sequence motifs that are important for a majority of the or family. the mystery of or transcriptional control remains and will need to be addressed by experimental approaches, perhaps in combination with sequence analyses similar to those we describe here. the recent finding that epigenetic marks may be important in or regulation  <cit>  opens a promising new line of inquiry.
