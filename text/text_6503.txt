BACKGROUND
steroids have profound effects on the brain. in the zebra finch , regulation of the estrogenic steroid estradiol  within the zebra finch brain may have functional consequences for song behavior. in zebra finches, males sing but females do not. males also have a larger and more interconnected set of brain areas, or nuclei, specialized to learn and produce song than females  <cit> . early in development, e <dig> masculinizes the song circuit required for song production and in adulthood, the function of song areas can be altered by changes in e <dig> after song experience  <cit> .

the gonads do not supply the steroids that direct masculinization of the song circuit, but the brain may be an essential source of e <dig> both during development and in adulthood  <cit> . it is still unclear, however, how steroids produced in the brain act on the song system  <cit> . therefore, two non-exclusive theories have been proposed to explain the origin of sex differences in this system: sex differences are caused by local differences in steroid synthesis in or near the song control circuit  <cit> , and sex differences are caused by the differential effect of genes localized to sex chromosomes  <cit> .

evidence exists to support both theories. many of the major steroid -producing and -transducing factors that can act on the song circuit are present in the zebra finch brain  <cit> . for example, early developmental e <dig> administration to females acts in the brain to induce a masculine song circuit and the closer the source of steroids is to a song nucleus the more potent its effect, cultured brain slices produce e <dig> and manipulations of e <dig> levels and estrogen receptor action in these slices prevent full masculinization of song circuitry, and the e2-synthetic enzyme aromatase is present in presynaptic terminals within major song nuclei; in fact, in adult male zebra finches, the brain is the major source of e <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, in vivo manipulations of e <dig> synthesis and action in males does not consistently significantly de-masculinize the song system, the song circuit in genetic females is not masculinized by the presence of functional steroid-secreting testes, and the song nuclei within the male hemisphere of a naturally-occurring gynandromorph  are larger than those in the genetically female hemisphere  <cit> . although in some cases, these findings are partially consistent with the neural steroid synthesis hypothesis, they primarily suggest that genetic differences between males and females contribute to the masculine development of the song system.

indeed, in mammals and in zebra finches, data is accumulating that male brain cells are fundamentally different than female cells by virtue of their different complement of sex chromosomes: xx/xy in mammalian females and males, and zw/zz in avian females and males, respectively. there is evidence that genes on the sex chromosomes might influence sexual differentiation of the zebra finch song system  <cit> . the potential for sex chromosome genes to display sex differences in expression levels is especially high in the zebra finch because sex chromosome dosage compensation is largely ineffective in birds at the mrna level  <cit> .

here, we examine 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  <dig> , a steroidogenic enzyme that converts e <dig> to a less potent estrogen, estrone . inasmuch as hsd17b <dig> is present and active in particular brain regions, it could regulate the local concentrations of e <dig>  this could impact the organization and function of the song circuit  <cit> . previous experiments have shown evidence that hsd17b <dig> is localized to the z chromosome and has a male-biased sex difference in brain expression levels across development  <cit> . hsd17b <dig> therefore represents a convergence of the steroidal and genetic theories of song system sexual differentiation. all of this also suggests, however, that e <dig> might be less available to the male brain, a prediction contrary to findings that e <dig> masculinizes the song system.

we therefore used several techniques to examine hsd17b <dig> dna, mrna, and enzyme activity in male and female zebra finch brains. we used posthatch day  <dig>  and adult birds because at both ages, e <dig> meaningfully impacts the song system. p <dig> is within the period when steroid administration has the greatest masculinizing effect on song nuclei, other steroid-synthesizing genes are expressed in the brain at this early age, and it is just prior to the earliest emergence of identifiable song control nuclei  <cit> . thus expression of hsd17b <dig> at this early age could alter the local steroid environment that contributes to the initial organization of song nuclei. in adulthood, measures in song nuclei show the potential for rapid and synaptic regulation of estradiol synthesis, which could have functional consequences for song production and perception  <cit> . our results show that hsd17b <dig> is sexually dimorphic and could impact both developing and mature song nuclei, consistent with a previous report, and that dosage compensation of hsd17b <dig> gene may act at a post-transcriptional level  <cit> . it will require further study to understand how these dosage compensation mechanisms affect neural steroid production, and therefore organization and function of the sexually dimorphic song control circuit.

RESULTS
zebra finch hsd17b <dig> gene and cdna sequences
we used two independently cloned cdnas as probes for the molecular experiments. the clone used for bacterial artificial clone  library screening, and northern and southern blot hybridizations was an expressed sequence tag  cloned by the songbird neurogenomics initiative  as part of its transcriptome project  <cit> . based on alignment with the zebra finch hsd17b <dig> gene model , this cdna includes sequence beginning at exon  <dig> through the end of the transcript and therefore spans part of the hydratase-dehydrogenase epimerase  domain, the entire sterol carrier protein  <dig>  domain  <cit>  and the 3'-utr . the comparison of zebra finch, chicken, human, mouse and zebra fish predicted amino acid sequences showed that there is high conservation along hde and scp <dig> domains .

prior to the song est project, we had cloned a hsd17b <dig> cdna that we used as the riboprobe template for our brain in situ hybridization experiments. the sequence of this clone spans almost exactly the same region of gene as the song est except that it begins  <dig> bp after the est at the 5' end of the gene and extends  <dig> bp further than the est at 3' end. the high level of cdna sequence conservation across species, including essential functional domains, demonstrated that both cdnas used in subsequent molecular experiments are almost certainly specific for hsd17b <dig> 

to further confirm that the molecular tools we used were indeed hsd17b <dig>  we examined the cdna clone sequences in relation to the gene sequence in the zebra finch genome assembly. using the apollo genome annotation curation tool, we manually annotated the zebra finch dna sequence from the genome assembly, the nucleotide sequences of the two clones we used for experiments, and other available transcript sequences to confirm the hsd17b <dig> gene model  <cit> . in the zebra finch assembly, the gene was mapped to chromosome z: <dig> ,644- <dig> , <dig>  as in the human gene, the zebra finch gene model contains  <dig> coding exons, although we were unable to predict the precise boundaries of the 5'-untranslated  region of the zebra finch gene using existing sequence data  <cit> .

confirmation of z chromosome localization
we examined the intensity of hybridization on a southern blot that contained male and female genomic dna and to test if we could detect a sex difference in hsd17b <dig> gene abundance. to control for the possibility that gene products derived from one enzyme digestion could provide spurious results, we digested the genomic dna with two enzymes, haeii and hindiii, which results in two different banding patterns . the male and female dna showed virtually the same pattern of hybridized dna fragments when digested with the same enzyme, with the exception of light-appearing bands that are visible in the male sample but not the female sample . in cases when dna products are visible in both male and female samples, the male bands appear to show darker hybridization signals than the corresponding female band. this suggests that the apparent sex difference in dna digest products likely reflects the detection limit of the blot, not a biological difference in dna content. the fact that hybridization showed stronger signals in the male dna, almost twice the signal as from hybridization to the female dna sample, suggests more copies of the gene in males than females . the lack of a female-specific band in the southern blot also suggests that the w chromosome does not have sequences homologous to ck <dig> 

to confirm the z chromosome localization of hsd17b <dig> gene, we used the est to first screen a zebra finch bac library http://www.genome.arizona.edu to isolate a larger genomic clone to be used as the fluorescent in situ hybridization  probe  <cit> . the selected bac clone, 094l <dig>  encompassed hsd17b <dig> and mapped to the short arm of zebra finch z chromosome by fish . the hsd17b <dig> bac clone also cross-hybridized to the w chromosome, suggesting that the bac clone contained the zebra finch zbm - related sequence  <cit> .

northern blot hybridization shows sex difference in mrna levels
northern blot hybridization for male and female whole brain or gonads showed higher expression of hsd17b <dig> gene in males relative to females . in both the brain and gonads, the male:female ratio of the density of hsd17b <dig> hybridization was  <dig> . in the brain samples, we could confirm that this sex bias was not due to overall differences in rna levels loaded onto the blot; the male:female ratio of gapdh control hybridization was  <dig> . a similar control measure could not be obtained for the gonads because gapdh expression levels can differ across tissues and the results here are consistent with previous reports that the zebra finch testes express higher levels of gapdh than ovaries  <cit> .

sex differences and song system localization of hsd17b <dig> mrna
in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of hsd17b <dig> mrna in the brains of both males and females, at p <dig> and in adulthood. brain sections hybridized with the antisense probe showed widespread labeling of cells that express hsd17b <dig> . as expected, sections hybridized with the negative control sense-configured probes showed no label .

at p <dig>  we detected hsd17b <dig> hybridization throughout the telencephalon and in the area that resembled the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium  in male and female brains. this was the only brain area that resembled a song nucleus that was visible at this young age, based on its neuroanatomical position and boundaries . there was no significant sex difference in hybridization density measurements of the entire telencephalon . within the presumptive lman region of p <dig> birds, however, t-tests showed there was a significant sex difference  in hsd17b <dig> hybridization intensity .

we also detected hsd17b <dig> mrna in the adult male hvc  nucleus of the song circuit, though we were unable to perform a quantitative sex comparison because hvc was not reliably identified in comparable sections in females . hybridization label in other song areas present in both males and females  were not greater than the surrounding telencephalon. therefore, we analyzed hsd17b <dig> hybridization intensities on the entire left and right telencephalic lobes in sections that spanned the entire rostral-caudal extent. this analysis revealed significantly higher hybridization levels in the telencephalon of males than of females .

hsd17b <dig> activity does not show a sex difference
several initial experiments were performed to first optimize the conditions for the final biochemical assessments of hsd17b <dig> activity in the brain. a timecourse experiment showed that a  <dig> minute incubation was optimal for accurately measuring hsd17b <dig> activity . presence of an e <dig> cold trap decreased the detectable conversion of e <dig> to e <dig> approximately two-fold . therefore, cold trap was not used in subsequent experiments. lastly, a concentration gradient determined that  <dig> nm 3h-e <dig> was the optimum substrate concentration for measuring hsd17b <dig> activity after  <dig> minutes of incubation .

using the optimized conditions, we first analyzed hsd17b <dig> activity in the telencephalon and diencephalon of adult male and female birds. two-way anova for sex, region and the sex by region interaction showed that there was no significant overall effect of sex , brain region , or the interaction  on hsd17b <dig> activity levels .

in a separate set of birds, we performed another assay for hsd17b <dig> activity in two telencephalic regions that contained brain regions that in situ hybridization and northern blot results suggested would have hsd17b <dig> activity , diencephalon, and gonads . in this experiment, we found that the gonads contained significantly more hsd17b <dig> activity than the brain . when the three brain areas were then analyzed for effects of age, sex, and their interaction, we found again that sex had no significant main effect on hsd17b <dig> activity levels . individual t-tests for the effect of sex within each of the three brain areas also did not detect a sex difference in any individual region . in this assay, we did detect a significant main effect of brain area . post-hoc analysis demonstrated that the effect of brain area was due to higher levels of hsd17b <dig> activity in the diencephalon compared to the two telencephalic regions. further, there was a significant interaction between sex and brain area . the interaction occurred because in the diencephalon, we measured higher  hsd17b <dig> activity levels in the female  compared to the male  but in the two telencephalic regions, hsd17b <dig> activity levels were higher in the male  than in the female .

discussion
estradiol is a potent masculinizing steroid for the developmental growth of the sexually dimorphic song circuit in the zebra finch. estradiol also continues to impact the function of song regions in adult birds  <cit> . unlike most sexually dimorphic systems, gonadal secretions do not control song circuit masculinization. consequently, two non-exclusive theories have been proposed to explain the sex difference in the song circuit: the neural production of steroids and the differential expression of sex chromosome genes in the brain. here, we examined hsd17b <dig>  an e2-metabolizing enzyme mapped to the z sex chromosome, as an example of how these two theories might converge.

we confirmed the z chromosome localization of the hsd17b <dig> gene, and that the abundance of hsd17b <dig> dna and brain mrna is approximately two-times greater in males a than in females, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . based on in situ hybridization signal distributions here and in a previous study, it may be that hsd17b <dig> has a specific role in the sexual differentiation and function of the song circuit. here, we showed that in the first week of posthatch development when e <dig> is most effective for masculinizing the song nuclei, hsd17b <dig> expression is detectable in the p <dig> brain and expression levels are higher in an area that appears to be lman in males than in females. if this is indeed lman, it would be the earliest identification of this nucleus in the zebra finch. further, the lman expression appears to be developmentally regulated; in p <dig> birds, hsd17b <dig> hybridization intensity in lman was also higher than in the adjacent telencephalic tissue but there was no significant sex difference within the song nucleus, and by adulthood, label was not noticeably greater in lman than in the surrounding brain  <cit> . in contrast, we were able to detect hsd17b <dig> mrna in the hvc of adult males , where hsd17b <dig> mrna has been shown to be significantly enriched compared to the surrounding telencephalon in p <dig> and adult males  <cit> . this song nucleus also contains synaptic aromatase that can be modulated by song production, thus both aromatase and hsd17b <dig> may together regulate the availability of e <dig> in the adult hvc  <cit> .

the higher levels of hsd17b <dig> expression in the male brain compared to the female brain, in particular within song control nuclei, were counterintuitive given extensive evidence that e <dig> masculinizes these areas  <cit> . nevertheless, the higher expression of hsd17b <dig> mrna in males than females was consistent with previous findings that many z chromosome genes are poorly dosage compensated in birds; the majority of genes on the z chromosome show higher mrna levels in males  than females   <cit> . the incomplete dosage compensation in birds differs strikingly from the effective dosage compensation patterns found in other species  <cit> . it is generally accepted, however, that dosage compensation is critical and ubiquitous among species with heteromorphic sex chromosomes like the avian z and w  <cit> . thus, it was possible that dosage compensation could occur via post-transcriptional mechanisms in the zebra finch.

we therefore assayed the activity levels of hsd17b <dig> in adult brains. our results demonstrate that this enzyme is active in metabolizing e <dig> in the zebra finch. however, in two major brain regions and in two experiments, the conversion of e <dig> to e <dig> was not significantly different between adult males and females - the sex difference in hsd17b <dig> mrna levels in the adult brain does not translate into a sex difference in activity levels. therefore, while the neuroanatomical mapping of hsd17b <dig> mrna suggested that this enzyme may influence the sex-specific organization and function of the song control circuit by reducing the availability of e <dig> in males, our biochemical results indicate that post-transcriptional mechanisms may regulate neural hsd17b <dig> activity to minimize the sex difference found in hsd17b <dig> expression levels.

perhaps regulatory mechanisms that are known to modify enzyme activity, such as phosphorylation and availability of substrate or cofactors, could explain our results. these factors might override the tendency for greater enzyme activity based on the male bias in mrna abundance. enzymes in particular have been theorized to be relatively dosage insensitive because their function is often more strongly dependent on properties other than the copy number of the genes encoding them  <cit> . steroidogenic enzyme regulation may have been especially relevant to the evolution of an e2-sensitive neural circuit such as the zebra finch song system. the precise mechanisms that control, and the functional significance of, this region-specific regulation of hsd17b <dig> activity remains to be discovered.

CONCLUSIONS
hsd17b <dig> is a z-linked enzyme that shows a sex difference in dna dose and mrna expression levels, but not in activity levels. the post-transcriptional regulation of hsd17b <dig> may signal that e <dig> metabolism is tightly controlled in the brains of both male and female zebra finches.
