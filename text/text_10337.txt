BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a dominant class of short transcripts that regulate gene expression in both animals and plants  <cit> . most mirna genes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii, producing a long hairpin structure called a primary mirna   <cit> . the pri-mirna is subsequently processed to a precursor mirna  by a microprocessor called drosha . exportin- <dig> then mediates the transport of the pre-mirna to the cytoplasm where it is further processed to a ~22 nt mirna duplex by dicer  <cit> . usually, one strand of the duplex is loaded onto an ago protein  <cit>  and this complex then binds to the 3′-untranslated region of mrnas and functions in transcript degradation or translational repression  <cit> . in recent years, many studies of mirnas in animals have been published. in mirbase  <dig> , there are  <dig> human,  <dig> mouse ,  <dig> chicken , and  <dig> zebrafish  mature mirnas recorded  <cit> . although the functions of most mirnas have not yet been fully elucidated, the majority of mirna sequences are evolutionarily conserved among species, indicating that they have a conserved biological function  <cit> . studies of model organisms, such as small fish, provide convenient ways to understand how mirnas function, which is often difficult in humans  <cit> .

the zebrafish, whose draft genome was reported recently, is the most popular species in which to analyze fish mirnas  <cit> . most studies of mirnas in zebrafish have explored their roles in tissue development and differentiation  <cit> ; there has been less focus on expression in specific tissues. therefore, tissue-specific mirnas remain to be identified in fish. in addition, although there are  <dig> mirna genes encoded in the zebrafish genome, as reported in mirbase  <dig>   <cit> , this number is far lower than that in humans  and mice , suggesting that mirnas in fish have not been fully catalogued. the investigation of mirnas in t. rubripes, in addition to that in zebrafish, would be a significant contribution to our knowledge of fish mirnas and would provide essential information concerning the biological function of many conserved mirnas in vertebrates. however, even though most mirna sequences are conserved in vertebrates, some mirnas with low expression levels seem to be non-conserved or organism specific. the identification and characterization of fish-specific mirnas would contribute to our understanding of how fish are different from other vertebrates.

in this study, we performed next-generation sequencing of small rnas in t. rubripes to identify mirna expression patterns in different organs of t. rubripes and give fundamental information to aid understanding of mirna populations in this species. these data will be of assistance in functional studies of mirnas in t. rubripes.

RESULTS
sequencing of t. rubripes small rnas
we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads of  <dig> nucleotides, with additional exact barcode sequences. low-quality reads were eliminated using our own perl scripts. after the trimming of 3′ adaptors,  <dig> , <dig> small rna reads of 1– <dig> nucleotides were retrieved .

size distribution of small rnas
we constructed a small rna size distribution profile for each tissue. in somatic tissue, small rnas of  <dig> nucleotides were the most abundant, followed by those of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides. in the ovaries and testes, the vast majority of small rnas were 26– <dig> nucleotides in length, with most having  <dig> nucleotides .fig.  <dig> size distribution pattern of small rnas in different tissues of t. rubripes. size distribution pattern of small rna reads after normalizing against  <dig> million 1–35 nt small rna reads; fast muscle , slow muscle , heart , eye , brain , intestine , liver , ovaries , and testes 



proportion of mirnas in individual tissues
because mirna sequences are conserved in vertebrates, we identified mirnas by conducting a homology search against the mirna database. after investigating the length distributions of known mirnas deposited in mirbase  <dig>   <cit> , we found that almost every mirna was 18–25 nt in length. therefore, small rna sequences  were subjected to a blast search against mature mirnas deposited in mirbase  <dig>   <cit> . the criteria for mirna annotation were as follows :  <dig>  query reads exactly match the reference sequences;  <dig>  reads with 1–2 nt extended or shortened at the 5′ end, and/or reads with 1–4 nt extended or shortened at the 3′ end of known mirnas. using these criteria, among the small rna sequence reads approximately  <dig>  % in fast muscle,  <dig>  % in slow muscle,  <dig>  % in heart,  <dig>  % in eye,  <dig>  % in brain,  <dig>  % in intestine, and  <dig>  % in liver were identified as mirnas. however, the proportion of small rna sequence reads that were mirnas in the ovaries and testes was only  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively .fig.  <dig> mirna proportions as percentages of 18–25 nt small rnas. the dark blue color indicates reads that exactly matched the reference sequences, 1–2 nt extended or shortened at the 5′ end, or 1–4 nt extended or shortened at the 3′ end of known mirnas. the red color indicates the complete match of continuous sequences of 16 nt or more. the green color indicates the matching of continuous sequences of less than 16 nt with a smith-waterman score equal to or more than  <dig>  the purple color indicates the matching of continuous sequences of less than 16 nt with a smith-waterman score less than  <dig>  the light blue color indicates 18–25 nt unidentified small rnas. fast muscle , slow muscle , heart , eye , brain , intestine , liver , ovaries , and testes 



because of these stringent criteria, large numbers small rnas were not identified, because of possible 3′ variations or sequence errors. we then employed more flexible criteria . specifically, if sequences of the first  <dig> nucleotides were identical to those of known mirnas, we performed further analysis. among these sequences, we first investigated those that completely matched a continuous mirna sequence of 16 nt or more. following these criteria, among the small rna sequence reads, approximately  <dig>  % in fast muscle,  <dig>  % in slow muscle,  <dig>  % in heart,  <dig>  % in eye, 45 % in brain,  <dig>  % in intestine,  <dig>  % in liver, 11 % in ovaries, and  <dig>  % in testes were identified as mirnas. if the continuous sequences of perfect match were less than 16 nt, we used a smith-waterman algorithm in fasta v <dig> to evaluate the reads. we set the parameters as ‘5’ for match and ‘−4’ for mismatch. according to this algorithm, we considered the sequences with smith-waterman scores of at least  <dig> as mirnas. according to these criteria, among the small rna sequences,  <dig>  % in fast muscle,  <dig>  % in slow muscle,  <dig>  % in heart,  <dig>  % in eye,  <dig>  % in brain,  <dig>  % in intestine,  <dig>  % in liver,  <dig>  % in ovaries, and  <dig>  % in testes, were retrieved as mirnas. among the reads in which the first  <dig> nucleotides were identical with those of known mirnas, the remaining sequences were annotated as putative mirnas, which represented  <dig>  % in fast muscle,  <dig>  % in slow muscle,  <dig>  % in heart,  <dig>  % in eye,  <dig>  % in brain,  <dig>  % in intestine,  <dig>  % in liver,  <dig>  % in ovaries, and  <dig>  % in testes .

the vast majority of mirnas in all tissues was approximately 21–23 nt in length. in the eye, brain, and intestine, the numbers of mirnas that were 21 nt in length were similar to the numbers that were 22 nt in length . for putative mirnas, sequences that were 22 nt were the most abundant in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. putative mirnas that were 18 nt in size were most abundant in the brain and intestine. in the eye, putative mirnas that were 20 nt in length were the most highly expressed .

we also investigated the proportion of mirnas in small rnas of 18–25 nt in each tissue. approximately 50–90 % of small rnas of the nt length 20– <dig> in fast muscle, 19– <dig> in slow muscle, 19– <dig> in heart, 21– <dig> in eye, 18– <dig> in brain, 19– <dig> in intestine, and 19– <dig> in liver were categorized as mirnas, including putative mirnas. in the gonads, for each length of small rna between  <dig> and 25 nt, less than 50 % were identified as mirnas, including putative mirnas, except for small rnas of 22 nt in the ovaries .

we constructed a pie chart of the proportion of mirnas in small rna populations of 1–35 nt. more than 50 % of small rnas in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and intestine were identified as mirnas, and in the eye and liver,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, were categorized as mirnas. in the ovaries and testes, only  <dig>  and 1 %, respectively, of the small rnas were annotated as mirnas. in addition, the major proportion of small rnas in the gonads was 26–31 nt .

expression profile of t. rubripes mirnas in different tissues
for each tissue, we counted the number of each mirna and generated a mirna expression profile across the tissues. the number of reads of individual mirnas was normalized against the total number of 18–25 nt small rna reads in each tissue, giving the number of reads for an individual as mirnas per million . the expression profile showed that many mirnas were highly expressed in more than one tissue, or were ubiquitously expressed, such as fru-mir-145-5p, which exhibited a high expression level in all tissues. however, some mirnas exhibited a biased expression in specific tissues. for example, fru-mir-1-3p was muscle specific, fru-mir-196a-5p was skeletal muscle specific, fru-mir-499-5p was heart and slow muscle specific, fru-mir-204-5p was eye specific, fru-mir-9-3p was brain and eye specific, fru-mir-192-5p was intestine and liver specific, fru-mir-122-5p was liver specific, and fru-mir-202-5p was ovary specific. even though the ovaries and testes had a much lower proportion of mirnas than somatic tissue, some mirnas, such as fru-mir-202-5p and fru-mir-2478-3p, had higher levels of expression in the ovaries and testes, respectively, than in somatic cells. these results were confirmed by stem-loop reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  .fig.  <dig> comparison of next-generation sequencing and qpcr-based profiling of representative ubiquitous and tissue-specific mirnas. expression profiles of ubiquitous , muscle-specific , skeletal muscle-specific , heart and slow muscle-specific , eye-specific , brain and eye-specific , intestine-specific and liver-specific , liver-specific , ovary-specific , and testes-abundant  mirnas. the left-hand y axis shows the result from q-pcr and right-hand y axis shows the result from next-generation sequencing



quantitative pcr of representative ubiquitous and tissue-specific mirnas in t. rubripes
ten mirnas, identified above, were selected for stem-loop quantitative pcr analysis to confirm the sequencing results . the next-generation sequencing results of fru-mir-145-5p, fru-mir-1-3p, fru-mir-204-5p, fru-mir-9-3p and fru-mir-122-5p correlated well with those of q-pcr. however, for fru-mir-499-5p, fru-mir-192-5p, fru-mir-196a-5p, fru-mir-202-5p  and fru-mir-2478-3p, the results from q-pcr were not consistent with the sequencing results. these inconsistencies may be caused by the primers that were not specific enough to the target mirnas.

putative differentially expressed mirnas in muscle tissue
to identify mirnas that exhibited specific expression in fast, slow, or cardiac muscles, the relative ratios of normalized reads were used to identify differentially expressed mirnas among the muscle tissues. first, we compared the mirna expression profile between fast and cardiac muscle. fru-mir-206-3p, fru-mir-10b-5p, fru-mir-10d-5p, fru-mir-133b-3p, and fru-mir-133-3p exhibited  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> times higher levels of expression, respectively, in fast muscle compared with cardiac muscle, while fru-mir-144-5p, fru-mir-499-5p, fru-mir-187-3p, fru-mir-499a-5p, and fru-mir-140-3p exhibited 51-, 41-, 37-, 33-, and 17-fold higher expression levels, respectively, in heart muscle compared with fast muscle. second, we compared mirna expression profiles between slow and cardiac muscle. expression levels of fru-mir-196a-5p, fru-mir-206-3p, fru-mir-194-5p, fru-mir-192-5p, and fru-mir-10b-5p in slow muscle were 1305-, 529-, 93-, 85-, and 77-fold higher, respectively, compared with cardiac muscle, while expression levels of fru-mir-187-3p, fru-mir-30e-3p, fru-mir-140-3p, fru-mir-218a-5p, and fru-mir-140-5p were 16-, 16-, 10-, 8-, and 6-fold higher, respectively, in cardiac muscle compared with slow muscle. we also compared mirna expression levels between the skeletal muscles. fru-mir-30e-3p exhibited an approximately 4-fold higher expression level in fast muscle compared with slow muscle. fru-mir-133a-3p, fru-mir-133a-5p, and fru-mir-3571-5p exhibited an approximately 3-fold higher level of expression, in fast muscle compared with slow muscle. in contrast, fru-mir-126b-5p, fru-mir-194-5p, fru-mir-499-5p, fru-mir-30e-5p, and fru-mir-30c-5p exhibited 121-, 21-, 13-, 11-, and 4-fold higher levels of expression, respectively, in slow muscle compared with fast muscle . however, these differential results are putative because they are base on one transcriptome analysis.table  <dig> top five putative differentially expressed mirnas compared between  <dig> muscle tissues

mirnas with more than a  <dig> -fold difference in expression between muscle tissues and expression levels of more than  <dig> rpm were selected



putative differentially expressed mirnas in the gonads
we used the relative ratios of normalized reads to find differentially expressed mirnas in the ovaries and testes, to identify sex-specific or sexually dimorphic mirnas. of the mirnas that exhibited higher expression levels in the ovaries compared with the testes, fru-mir-214-3p and fru-mir-143-3p exhibited the greatest differences in expression. they exhibited an approximately 24-fold higher expression level, in the ovaries compared with the testes, followed by fru-mir-202-5p, fru-mir-24-3p, and fru-mir-145b-5p, whose expression levels were approximately 22-, 20-, and 20-fold higher, respectively, in the ovaries compared with the testes. of the mirnas that exhibited greater expression in the testes compared with the ovaries, fru-mir-2478-3p and fru-mir-2898-3p exhibited levels in the testes that were twice those in the ovaries . however, we could only claim these results as putative differential expression patterns as described above.table  <dig> putative differentially expressed mirnas compared between ovaries and testes

mirnas with more than a  <dig> -fold difference in expression between ovaries and testes and expression levels of more than  <dig> rpm were selected



isomirs in t. rubripes
isomirs refer to mature mirna sequences in which a few nucleotides vary at the 5′/3′ termini compared with the major mature mirnas that originated from the same mirna hairpin. we chose fru-mir-145-5p, which was ubiquitously expressed, as a representative example to demonstrate the variation in mature mirna sequences. the sequence of fru-mir-145-5p was identical in every tissue. however, the sequence was different at the 3′ terminus compared with the mir-145-5p entries deposited in mirbase  <dig>   <cit> . fru-mir-145-5p exhibited more nucleotide variation in the 3′ region than in the 5′ region. among isomirs, approximately  <dig>  % in fast muscle,  <dig>  % in slow muscle,  <dig>  % in heart,  <dig>  % in eye,  <dig>  % in brain,  <dig>  % in intestine,  <dig>  % in liver,  <dig>  % in ovaries, and  <dig>  % in testes exhibited 3′ variation compared with the most abundant fru-mir-145-5p. approximately  <dig>  % in fast muscle,  <dig>  % in slow muscle,  <dig>  % in heart,  <dig>  % in eye,  <dig>  % in brain,  <dig>  % in intestine,  <dig>  % in liver,  <dig>  % in ovaries, and  <dig>  % in testes exhibited variation at both the 3′ and 5′ ends. less than  <dig>  % of isomirs exhibited only 5′ variation in fast muscle, slow muscle, heart, eye, brain, intestine, liver, ovaries, and testes. a sliding of the drosha cleavage site at the 5′ terminus occurred in a small population of fru-pri-mir- <dig> . this led to the production of different seed sequences in mature fru-mir- <dig> isomirs, and they may recognize different target mrnas. we investigated the major sequence of each mirna species across the tissues; fru-mir-462-5p, fru-mir-101b-3p, and fru-mir-133-3p exhibited significant variation at the 5′ terminus in some tissues .table  <dig> mirnas in which major isomirs exhibited 5′ variation among tissues and their expression levels

distribution of different small rna categories in each tissue
to classify the remaining unidentified small rnas , we performed homology searches against the ncbi database . in the 1–35 nt population, the majority of small rnas in the ovaries and testes were derived from repetitive elements. additionally, 70–75 % of them were identified to be 26–31 nt. the major proportion of small rnas of each length in the ovaries and testes  were also derived from repetitive elements . finally, in each somatic tissue, only about 1 % of small rnas were unidentified; while in the ovaries and testes  <dig>  and  <dig>  % were unidentified, respectively.fig.  <dig> proportions of small rna components. fast muscle , slow muscle , heart , eye , brain , intestine , liver , ovaries , and testes 



discussion
most mirnas are conserved among species; therefore, we identified mirnas by conducting a homology search against mature mirnas deposited in mirbase  <dig>   <cit> . in the 18–25 nt population, 69–86 % of small rnas in somatic tissue were annotated as mirnas, whereas only  <dig> and 5 % of small rnas in the ovaries and the testes, respectively, were categorized as mirnas. although only a small number of small rnas in the gonads were identified as mirnas, the number of mirna species in the ovaries and testes was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, which is similar to the number of mirnas in somatic tissue. among mirna species, we identified  <dig> in fast muscle,  <dig> in slow muscle,  <dig> in heart,  <dig> in eye,  <dig> in brain,  <dig> in intestine, and  <dig> in liver. our results suggest that many types of mirna might be expressed in the gonads at a low level of expression. we also identified small rna sequences as putative mirnas that have many variations at the 3′ terminus compared with known mirnas. these results show that, in every tissue, not more than 1 % of small rnas was annotated as putative mirnas. however, numbers of putative mirna species were higher than those of mirnas in every tissue except for the brain, and those in the ovaries and testes were much higher. the number of putative mirnas was  <dig> in fast muscle,  <dig> in slow muscle,  <dig> in heart,  <dig> in eye,  <dig> in brain,  <dig> in intestine,  <dig> in liver,  <dig> in ovaries, and  <dig> in testes, indicating that various species of putative mirna might be expressed in each tissue at a low level of expression. it may also be possible that some putative mirnas might be other types of small rna, fragment contaminants of longer rnas, or novel mirnas.

the rnas of 26–31 nt that originated from repetitive elements were highly expressed in the ovaries and testes. these small rnas may be pirnas, considering their length and high abundance in gonads. our results are similar to those of many previous studies; pirnas that are 26–31 nt in size are mainly expressed in the ovaries and testes . pirnas are associated with piwi proteins, which are members of the argonaute family  <cit> . pirna precursors are transcribed from an intergenic repetitive element or a pirna cluster . the main function of pirnas is to maintain the integrity of the genome by silencing transposable elements  <cit> .

considering the proportion of mirnas of each length from  <dig> to 25 nt, we found that the brain generated more variation in mirna sequence length than did the other tissues . this is possibly because the brain is the most complex organ in the vertebrate body. the human brain comprises  <dig>  difference types of neuron  <cit> . therefore, a wide range of mirna variants in the brain may be involved in brain function. modifications of mirnas at the 5′ terminus affect the seed region , and may lead to differential target recognition . furthermore, 3′ modifications have been reported to be involved in the stability of mirnas and the efficiency of target repression .

after constructing the mirna expression profiles and validating the results with stem-loop rt-qpcr, we found that many mirnas were ubiquitously expressed. for example, fru-mir-145-5p was highly expressed in every tissue. a previous study demonstrated that mir-145-5p plays an important role in enhancing smooth muscle cell differentiation and suppressing smooth muscle cell proliferation  <cit> . mir-145-5p targets and negatively regulates the pluripotency factors, oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and klf <dig>  in human embryonic stem cells  <cit> . in humans, mir-145-5p is highly abundant in the gonads and tissues arising from the mesoderm, such as the heart, spleen, uterus, and prostate  <cit> . however, some mirnas exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, suggesting that they play important roles in those tissues. our results  are in agreement with previous studies. for example, fru-mir- <dig> was abundant in skeletal muscle and the heart, as it is in many animals. previous studies have reported that in skeletal muscle, mir- <dig> is modulated by serum response factors , such as myod and mef <dig>  which are muscle differentiation regulators  <cit> . mir- <dig> plays a role in repressing embryonic stem cell differentiation into non-muscle cells in mice and humans  <cit> . in the heart, mir- <dig> targets the transcription factor hand <dig>  which accelerates the expansion of the cardiac muscle  <cit> . in mice, over-expression of mir- <dig> inhibits muscle proliferation  <cit> . mir- <dig> also regulates the development of cardiac hypertrophy  <cit> . in addition, arrhythmogenesis in infarcted rat hearts can be treated by injection with an antisense strand of mir- <dig>  <cit> .

fru-mir-192-5p was the most abundant mirna in the intestine. mir-192-5p belongs to the mir-192/ <dig> family  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> share identical seed sequences, and only differ by two nucleotides  <cit> . they are tumor suppressor mirnas, modulated by p <dig> , and they play a role in cell-cycle arrest to prevent tumorigenesis . they are biomarkers that are down-regulated in colon cancer  <cit> ; however, both are up-regulated in gastric cancer, where they target the adhesion molecule alcam  <cit> .

in this study, fru-mir- <dig> was a liver-specific mirna. this result is similar to those from previous studies in other organisms, such as drosophila, c. elegans, humans, and mice. the levels of mir- <dig> in blood plasma correlate with aminotransferase levels, which is an indicator of drug-induced liver injury  <cit> . moreover, changes in mirna levels can be detected earlier than changes in aminotransferase levels  <cit> . therefore, mir- <dig> is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for liver pathology  <cit> . mir- <dig> is a tumor suppressor mirna that negatively regulates adam <dig>  resulting in the repression of hepatocellular carcinoma angiogenesis and metastasis  <cit> . down-regulation of mir- <dig> can be used as a biomarker for hepatic cancer  <cit> .

some mirnas exhibit special expression patterns. for example, fru-mir-202-5p exhibited much higher expression levels in the ovaries than in the somatic tissue, although the proportion of mirnas in somatic tissue is much greater than that in the gonads, suggesting that they play crucial roles in germ cells. mir-202-5p exhibits sexual dimorphism during gonadal sex differentiation  <cit> . in embryonic chickens, it is up-regulated during testes differentiation from the onset of testes development  <cit> . during development of the mouse testes, mir-202-5p is a direct transcriptional target of sox <dig>  a transcription factor that plays a role in male sex determination  <cit> . it is highly expressed in sertoli cells when the male primordial germ cells differentiate into the testes  <cit> . however, in our study, fru-mir-202-5p was detected in both the ovaries and the testes because our sample was at a mature stage, a result that is consistent with previous studies; mir-202-5p is a postnatal gonad-specific mirna in atlantic halibut , xenopus, mice, pigs, and humans . these results suggest that mir-202-5p has an important function that involves sex determination during testes development, and also plays a crucial role in postnatal ovaries and testes  <cit> .

most of the mirna species exhibited variation at the 3′ terminus, while variation at the 5′ terminus was not as prevalent as that at the 3′ terminus  <cit> . shifts in the seed region  lead to differential target recognition and a role in gene regulation . in general, the major variant of each mirna species was common to all the tissues, but for some mirna species the most abundant variants had different seed sequences among the nine tissues, suggesting that mirnas may have different targets and functions in different tissues.

in this study, we identified many mirnas in t. rubripes. to validate the putative pirnas, more information regarding associated proteins  <cit>  and examination of nucleotide bias at the specific positions are required  <cit> . our data also showed other classes of small rnas that may have important, but yet unidentified, functions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated mirna expression patterns in various organs of t. rubripes. we identified  <dig> known mirna species. many mirnas exhibited conserved tissue-specific expression patterns, indicating that their basic functions share a common evolution among vertebrates. mirnas were mainly expressed in tissues other than the gonads, whereas putative pirnas were highly abundant in the ovaries and testes; however, some mirna species were highly abundant in the gonads. the most abundant isomirs of specific mirnas may have different functions in different tissues. our data may also include new kinds of small rnas. our data may also include new kinds of small rnas.
