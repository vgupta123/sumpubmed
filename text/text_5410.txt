BACKGROUND
in pigs, like in other domestic animals, breeding and product quality improvement require the control of several different traits . it is thus necessary to improve our knowledge of the major physiological functions and their interactions. for this purpose, the french national institute for agricultural research   <cit>  has launched a genomic research program, agenae   <cit>  for the identification and the functional and genetic characterisation of a large number of genes in cattle, pigs, chicken and trout  <cit> .

with the shift from map-based towards sequence-based gene discovery, the prevailing approach for creating transcription maps has become the generation of expressed sequence tags  <cit> . in pigs, the first est project  <cit>  and first large-scale est project were reported  <cit>  about ten years ago. subsequently, several research groups have generated ests from cdna libraries constructed from either a single porcine tissue or a limited number of tissues related to a stage of development or a function, such as anterior pituitary  <cit> , backfat  <cit> , brain  <cit> , liver  <cit> , skeletal muscle  <cit> , immune system tissues  <cit> , reproductive tissues  <cit>  and embryo  <cit> . the construction of full-length cdna libraries was reported more recently  <cit> .

to date, the construction of several pig arrays have been reported. some of them, with various supports, contain  <dig> to  <dig> cdna from specific libraries: brain tissue <cit>  , muscle  <cit>   <cit>  , embryo  <cit>  , immune system cells  <cit>  , but others aim at a generic analysis  of pig transcriptome with glass slides of in situ-synthesised oligonucleotides , spotted oligonucleotides   or cdnas .

we report here the construction of a pig multi-tissue cdna library, its sequencing and analysis, and the generation of a 9k nylon micro-array public tool for large scale expression profiling experiments.

RESULTS
cdna libraries construction and characterisation
starting from  <dig> tissues, six initial libraries containing  <dig>  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig> recombinant clones were generated . their average insert size was  <dig>  kb. the pooling and normalisation led to a  <dig>  million-clone library and the sub-library of abundant clones contained  <dig> clones. the average insert length of the normalised library was  <dig> kb and and the proportion of empty clones was low .

tissue samples from meishan and large white pigs at different stages of development or in different physiological conditions , young  or adult animal , pregnant, stressed or control animals) were taken and  <dig> libraries were constructed.

pcr amplification with specific primers for the external control genes srg <dig>  luciferase and i11a  was used to check the normalisation process . southern blot experiments demonstrated that the abundance of actin gene and of the abundant spike mrna srg <dig> have been greatly reduced by the normalisation process . in addition, quantitative pcr experiments  demonstrated that the representation of srg <dig> had been reduced  <dig> times, the representation of luciferase reduced  <dig> times and the representation of i11a increased  <dig>  times. in the normalised library, the representation of the external controls was estimated as follows: srg <dig> =  <dig> %, luciferase =  <dig> %, i11a =  <dig> % as compared to the initial frequencies of 10%,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

after a first round of sequencing, the library was subtracted with the  <dig> already-sequenced clones. the subtracted library contained  <dig>  <dig> clones. the quality of the subtraction was assessed by the sequencing of  <dig> clones .

sequencing
high-throughput sequencing was carried out on the normalised library. sequencing was performed from both ends for  <dig> clones. the sequencing effort was continued from 5'-end only for the next  <dig> clones. a total of  <dig> sequences were generated from the multi-tissue normalised library and  <dig> valid sequences  were submitted to embl-ebi nucleotide database   <cit> . polya was detected in  <dig> % of the 5'-end sequences and  <dig> % of the 3'-end sequences. polyadenylation signal was detected in  <dig> % of the polya-containing sequences with  <dig> % of aauaaa signal, which is consistent with previous estimations in humans  <cit> . the sequence of the medium-frequency external control  was present  <dig> times , which is higher than the estimated representation of the luciferase control  in the normalised library. the other two external control sequences were not detected , which is consistent with the estimated frequencies of these  <dig> controls . the proportion of fully-sequenced clones was  <dig> % for both-ends sequenced clones and  <dig> % for 5'-end sequenced clones. at this stage, the redundancy rate of the sequences had reached  <dig> % . one contig, corresponding to  <dig> clones out of  <dig>  was obviously responsible for a high proportion of redundancy. it corresponded to a 28s rna contamination, which was over-representated  by  <dig> members of the 28s rna contig in the driver, during subtraction of the normalised library.

in the first 384-sequences from the subtracted library, the proportion of 28s rna sequences had decreased towards  <dig> % and  <dig> % sequences were new, in comparison with the normalised library. the proportion of empty clones was still about 2%. a total of  <dig> clones were then 5'-end sequenced and  <dig>  sequences were released in the embl-ebi nucleotide database   <cit> . sequencing was then stopped: the redundancy had reached 39% . the embl accession numbers are listed in supplemental data  <dig>  polya was detected in  <dig> % of the sequences. polyadenylation signal was detected in  <dig> % of the polya-containing sequences. the sequence of the medium-frequency external control  was present  <dig> times. the other two external control sequences were still not detected.

the library construction method  during the first reverse transcription) led to short polya 3'-end stretches, allowing almost the same validity rate of the sequences either from 5'  or 3' -end. thus, even if 3'-end sequencing is useful to distinguish genes in a closely related family as the 3'-end non coding regions are more divergent, the 5'-end sequencing strategy was favoured to provide better annotated clones.

sequence assembly and analysis
agenae contribution to public sequence data
clustering of the  <dig>  public pig sequences, including ours, resulted in  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons . agenae sequences represent  <dig> % of the published sequences. at least one agenae sequence is present in  <dig>  contigs  and in  <dig>  of the deeper-than-one-contigs . the assembly shows that  <dig> contigs are specific of the agenae library. a high proportion of these contigs are singletons , which is higher than the proportion of singletons in the whole-data porcine assembly . this observation and the absence of high-depth specific contigs are evidence of the good normalisation and subtraction processes . although agenae sequences are a relatively small contribution to the international sequencing effort, they offered a very good tool to design cdna microarrays, since they represented  <dig> % of the deeper-than-one contigs. the cdna clones are also a valuable tool for gene expression studies.

the number of contigs highly depends on the parameters used when assembling the sequences. the tigr pig clustering <cit> , with nearly the same amount of data, lead to  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. careful annotation of the contigs and the next completion of the pig genome sequence may show that paralogous genes are sometimes clustered and that, on the contrary, overlapping contigs may have been split up. unigene clustering  <cit>  lead to  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the low number of singletons in unigene assembly is probably due to the fact unigene does not use part of the available singletons, as was already noticed with trout data  <cit> .

quality of the libraries
the analysis of the twenty deepest contigs  shows a high representation of ribosomal proteins, serum proteins, translation factor, that are often over-represented in cdna libraries  <cit> . eighteen of these twenty contigs are represented by at least one agenae est. however, the average frequency of agenae ests for these  <dig> contigs is  <dig> %, which is about ten times less than the frequency of agenae est in the public databases . this shows, again, that the normalisation and subtraction processes were efficient.

the  <dig> deepest contigs from all public pig cdna libraries were listed with their sigenae contig name, depth, % of agenae ests, best swissprot hit, hit accession, hit description and evalue, as annotated in the sigenae web interface  <cit> .

the analysis of the sequences obtained from the normalised library revealed a contamination by 28s ribosomal rna this type of contamination has already been described in cdna libraries  <cit> . this sequence has been over-represented in the subtraction driver and the analysis of the sequences from the subtracted library reveals the presence of  <dig> out of  <dig>  28s ribosomal clones . the proportion of this contamination has then been reduced by about  <dig> 

the twenty deepest agenae-specific-contigs are listed in table  <dig>  no hit is found with pig proteins. the best swissprot hit of  <dig> contigs are with either primates  rodent  or other mammals . four contigs do not have any swissprot hit. as many tissues were mixed to construct the libraries, without tagging of the cdnas, specific-tissue sequences were searched. the results are listed in table  <dig>  the traina protein, which is only expressed in epididymis is found  <cit> . so are gdf <dig>  which is specific to ovary and over-expressed in oocytes  <cit>  and specific mrna for heart, pituitary gland, muscle or stomach, demonstrating that the multi-tissue library strategy was efficient to get low-redundancy information from a large set of tissues.

the  <dig> deepest contigs containing only agenae pig ests were listed with their sigenae contig name, depth, best swissprot hit, hit accession, hit description and e-value, as annotated in the sigenae web interface  <cit> .

for each initial libray, at least one mammalian sequence of tissue-specific mrnas  was blasted against sigenae contigs. the sigenae contig name with a significant blast e-value is in the table, with its depth and one agenae clone and sequence.

microarray design and production
design
among the  <dig> sigenae pig contigs,  <dig> different contigs were chosen. for  <dig> of them, at least one representing clone belonged to the multi-tissue library and had an insert size compatible with pcr amplification . other contigs were either represented by a usda clone   <cit>  or a subtractive suppression library clone  . other clones come from different home-made libraries  and  <dig> controls were also included .

microarray quality control
the successive steps in the microarrays production have been checked for quality. firstly, the rearraying of the  <dig> selected clones or controls has been checked by sequencing  <dig> clones from each plate corner. a conformity of  <dig> % has been observed between the obtained and the expected sequences. the analysis of the results showed that the errors preexisted the rearraying. using robots for clone handling and bare-codes for microplate tracking during the rearraying procedure allowed us to keep a low error rate. secondly, the quality control of the pcr amplification showed 6% empty wells and  <dig> % double bands. the spots corresponding to the double bands samples were flagged and eliminated in the subsequent microarray data analysis. finally, the microarrays were controlled by oligonucleotide hybridisation. one negative control was positioned at the end of each block to check the absence of cross-contamination during the spotting . the median signal of these negative spots was used to calculate the general background and was compared to the signal of each spot. a spot was stated as present if its signal was superior to a threshold of  <dig> times background signal. a microarray batch was validated if 95% of expected spots were present and 100% of negative control spots were absent. in a previous analysis , we have observed that the membrane position in the robot has a slight effect on the spotting quality. then, we systematically proceeded to a hybridisation control on  <dig> extreme microarrays of each robot's tray. the microarrays batch was validated if all controlled micromembranes of this batch were validated. to date, about  <dig> valid micromembranes were produced.

this nylon array is a valuable tool for transcriptome analysis. the use of radiolabelled complex probes allows to detect low-expressed mrnas using small total rna amounts   <cit> . such arrays have been used in several studies on human cancer  <cit>  trout reproduction  <cit>  and pig transcriptome  <cit> , rigaldie, e and liaubet, l personal communications).

microarray gene ontology
gene ontology annotation was performed through a blastx strategy, against swissprot protein database. the recovery of a go annotation was better for the pig generic microarray  than for the all assembly contigs . this can be explained by the poorer go annotation of the  <dig> singletons of the all assembly , that were not chosen in the microarray design. the frequencies of the major go categories were about the same for the generic array versus the all assembly:  <dig> %  for biological process,  <dig> %  for cellular component and  <dig> %  for molecular function. the frequencies of the subcategories were calculated and are displayed in figure  <dig>  chi-square test, performed on the subcategory go frequencies showed that the 9k-microarray was a good representation of the available pig public sequences. it can therefore be used without bias to undertake transcriptome analysis on any model or function.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a pig multi-tissue cdna library which has been successfully normalised and subtracted. this library is derived from the most diverse tissue representation to date. it provides a large set of clones, with limited redundancy but good representation of the complex set of initial tissues. the  <dig>  sequences allowed a precise characterisation of the library and contributed to international cdna sequencing effort.

the 9k nylon cdna microarray is now used in several gene expression profiling projects, in pig health, reproduction and meat quality.
