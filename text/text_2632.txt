BACKGROUND
mycobacteria belong to the gc-rich actinomycetes, and as a genus contain diverse species including human pathogens, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium leprae, as well as free-living non-pathogenic soil bacteria such as mycobacterium smegmatis <cit> . mycobacteria must compete for nutrients and adapt to changing environments in order to survive, and nitrogen is essential for the synthesis of cellular macromolecules such as amino acids, nucleotides and cell wall components  <cit> . consequently, bacteria have developed complex systems that allow them to sense internal and external nitrogen levels and adjust their metabolism accordingly. the metabolic response to nitrogen limitation has been extensively studied in e. coli <cit>  which is often proposed as the prokaryotic model for this. however the regulation of nitrogen metabolism has also been studied in other actinomycetes, such as corynebacterium glutamicum and streptomyces species, and the signals, regulation and response mechanisms are different in these organisms, both compared to e. coli and to each other  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that mycobacteria also possess unique responses to nitrogen limitation, but this has not been studied in detail.

m. smegmatis, presumably as a consequence of living in the soil, contains the largest number of genes predicted to be involved in nitrogen metabolism within the genus  <cit> . notably it contains three ammonium transporters  in the cell wall, more than any other mycobacterial species, suggesting ammonium is an important nitrogen source for this organism  <cit> . once ammonium has entered the cell via diffusion across the cytoplasmic membrane or by protein-dependent transport, it is assimilated into the major biosynthetic nitrogen donors l-glutamate and l-glutamine through one of two pathways, depending on nitrogen availability. the low ammonium affinity glutamate dehydrogenase  enzyme is favourable in situations of nitrogen excess, whereas during nitrogen limitation the energy-requiring, higher affinity glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase   enzymes are required to meet the metabolic needs of the cell . not only does nitrogen limitation lead to the switching of biosynthetic pathways, it also induces the expression of several key mycobacterial nitrogen metabolism genes, including the amtb operon encoding the amtb ammonium transporter, a glnk  signalling protein and an adenylyl transferase , the two other ammonium transporters amt <dig> and amta, glutamine synthetase  and glutamate synthase   <cit> . post translational modifications of key nitrogen control enzymes also occurs in response to nitrogen limitation. glnd adenylylates the glnk  signalling protein on a conserved tyrosine residue in response to nitrogen limitation  <cit>  which causes the pii protein to dissociate from amtb porin channel, where it is bound  <cit> , permitting increased ammonium influx  <cit> . the gs enzyme is also post-translationally modified during nitrogen limitation, undergoing de-adenylylation by glne. the de-adenylylated gs enzyme is fully active  <cit>  ensuring maximal glutamine and glutamate synthesis occurs during times of nitrogen austerity. however, there are still many important gaps in our knowledge of nitrogen metabolism and its regulation in mycobacteria. for instance, the signal of nitrogen cellular status is unknown. recent studies in our laboratory have shown that the intracellular ratio of 2-oxoglutarate:glutamine in m. smegmatis greatly increases during nitrogen limitation and decreases when nitrogen is replenished, suggesting this may be the intracellular signal in mycobacteria  <cit> . however, how this signal is detected and transmitted into transcriptional and post-translational responses is unknown. the role of the pii proteins in mycobacterial nitrogen control is also unclear. in e. coli pii-ump controls the activity of the ntrc response regulator  <cit> , yet in mycobacteria pii-amp does not mediate the transcriptional response to nitrogen limitation  <cit> . finally, the regulator responsible for the transcriptional response to nitrogen limitation in m. smegmatis and the genes that make up this response are currently unknown.

in enteric bacteria, the transcriptional response to nitrogen limitation is mediated by the ntrbc two-component system  <cit> , which activates the expression of over  <dig> genes  <cit> . in c. glutamicum, the tetr-type response regulator amtr controls the transcriptional of at least  <dig> genes  <cit> , and in streptomyces, the ompr-type response regulator glnr control nitrogen metabolism  <cit> , at least  <dig> nitrogen response genes in s. coelicolor and at least  <dig> genes in s. venezuelae <cit> . m. smegmatis does not contain an ntrbc homolog, but does contain homologs of both s. coelicolor glnr  and c. glutamicum amtr   <cit> . to date no role has been reported for amtr in mycobacteria, and no c. glutamicum amtr binding site motifs have been identified in any mycobacterial genome  <cit> . however, the s. coelicolor glnr binding site motif has been identified in mycobacteria with three highly conserved cis elements located upstream of m. smegmatis amtb-glnk-glnd operon, amt <dig> and glna <dig> genes  <cit> . experimental confirmation of these binding sites led to the assignment of these five genes to the m. smegmatis glnr regulon  <cit> . we have recently shown that m. smegmatis glnr also regulates the expression of amta, nirb/d  and gltb/d in response to nitrogen stress  <cit> . however, given the number of nitrogen metabolism-related genes in the m. smegmatis genome, it is likely that many more are glnr-regulated, or that there are additional nitrogen response regulators.

therefore the aim of this study was to apply a global approach to the in vivo identification of glnr regulated genes in m. smegmatis. we combined genome-wide expression profiling, comparing a glnr mutant to the wild-type strain during nitrogen limited growth, with global analysis of glnr-dna interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation  and high-throughput sequencing . we show that glnr is the global nitrogen regulator in mycobacteria and plays a key role in regulating the assimilation and utilisation of nitrogen, controlling the expression of over  <dig> genes. we demonstrate that glnr can control the expression of divergent genes, and that it functions as both an activator and repressor of transcription. we also identify the consensus dna-binding motif found in all the glnr binding sites and determine key nucleotides in the motif for specific glnr binding.

RESULTS
glnr is the global regulator of gene expression in response to nitrogen limitation
we studied the expression profiles of m. smegmatis wild type and Δglnr deletion mutant  <cit>  grown in nitrogen limiting conditions, in order to identify the genes under glnr control. m. smegmatis wild type and Δglnr mutant were harvested one hour after nitrogen run-out, total rna was extracted and cdna hybridised to the m. smegmatis microarray. data was normalised and genes were considered significantly differentially expressed when they showed greater than 2-fold difference in expression between the wild type and Δglnr mutant with an fdr corrected p-value of < <dig> . fully annotated microarray data have been deposited in bμg@sbase  and also arrayexpress . the  <dig> previously identified glnr-regulated genes were all confirmed to be under glnr control during nitrogen stress , but in addition a total of  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated and  <dig> significantly down regulated . this indicates that glnr mediates  the expression of over  <dig> genes.

identification of glnr binding sites across the genome during nitrogen limitation
in order to identify which of the genes identified by transcriptional profiling are directly regulated by glnr we used chip-seq to identify the location of glnr binding sites in the genome during nitrogen limitation. cells were grown in  <dig> mm  or  <dig> mm  ammonium sulphate, and dna-protein complexes were cross-linked one hour after ammonium depletion; nitrogen excess samples were cross-linked at the same time point, cells were then lysed and the dna sheared by sonication. glnr-bound dna fragments were immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified anti-glnr polyclonal antibody. we performed quantitative pcr on the glutamine synthetase  and nitrite reductase  promoter regions to confirm the enrichment of glnr binding regions in nitrogen limited cells compared to nitrogen replete; a gene thought not to be glnr regulated  was included as a negative control .

immunoprecipitated dna was then prepared for sequencing using the illumina chip-seq library kit, and dna libraries sequenced using an illumina hiseq <dig>  which generated approximately  <dig> million reads per sample that were then mapped to the m. smegmatis genome using bowtie  <cit> . all chip-seq data files have been deposited into arrayexpress . glnr binding regions were identified using the peak-calling algorithm sissrs   <cit> , with peaks defined as significant if they showed greater than 5-fold enrichment in the immunoprecipitated sample compared to the input control at a p value of <  <dig> . this identified  <dig> glnr binding sites during nitrogen limitation ,  <dig> of which were also observed in nitrogen excess conditions , but with much lower peak intensity values. for example a glnr binding site was identified under both conditions upstream of glna  with a peak intensity value of  <dig>  in nitrogen excess and  <dig>  in nitrogen limitation . all glnr binding sites were located in the promoter regions of genes, except peak number  <dig>  which was located within msmeg <dig>

the identification of the three previously known glnr binding sites  in our chip-seq data  validated our approach. however, we used purified glnr protein and electromobility shift assays  to further validate four of the novel glnr dna binding regions identified in this study. dna sequences  representing the promoter regions of peak  <dig> , peak  <dig> , peak  <dig> , peak  <dig> , and peak  <dig> , all showed specific glnr binding, with the dna/protein complex shift dependent on dna concentration. the promoter region of msmeg <dig>  a region not identified as a glnr binding site in this study and included as a negative control, showed no glnr binding .

delineation of the glnr regulon during nitrogen limitation
in order to identify the genes controlled directly by glnr and thus forming the glnr regulon, we mapped the  <dig> binding sites onto the profile of transcripts regulated by glnr during nitrogen limitation, using the integrated genome viewer  <cit> , examples of which can be seen in figure  <dig> . forty-four glnr binding sites corresponded to the differential expression of  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which were located in  <dig> operons . interestingly as well as the  <dig> genes up-regulated by glnr during nitrogen limitation,  <dig> genes  were down regulated, indicating that glnr functions as both an activator and repressor of transcription. glnr binding also controlled the expression of  <dig> pairs of divergent genes .

genes adjacent to  <dig> of the  <dig> glnr binding sites did not show any differential expression during nitrogen limitation  . one of those sites, peak  <dig>  was the only one not in an intergenic region, but located in the 3’ end of msmeg <dig>  additional file 4: figure s <dig> shows the binding site identified for peak  <dig>  with little evidence of a clear peak; this is likely a mis-call by the sissrs programme. to confirm this, rate limiting qpcr was performed using dna immunoprecipitated from nitrogen limiting and excess conditions, and no enrichment was observed , therefore this binding site was excluded from the glnr regulon. two binding sites  were upstream of genes not present in the microarray, therefore these genes were analysed by qrt-pcr. msmeg <dig>  showed significant differential expression in the wt compared to the Δglnr mutant under nitrogen limitation  and was therefore deemed to be part of the glnr regulon, but the gene adjacent to peak  <dig>  msmeg <dig>  was not differentially expressed .

in order to further investigate the other  <dig> binding sites showing no de, rate limiting qpcr was performed on immunoprecipitated dna from cells grown under nitrogen limiting and excess conditions. additional file 5: figure s <dig> shows enrichment of the  <dig> promoter regions in nitrogen limitation compared to nitrogen excess; glnr binding to peak  <dig> was also confirmed by emsa . therefore these  <dig> peaks may be part of the glnr regulon, although it would appear that glnr does not alter transcription of these genes under the conditions tested. the complete glnr regulon, including these  <dig> putative members, is provided in additional file 7: table s <dig> 

identification and analysis of the m. smegmatis glnr consensus binding motif
the nucleotide sequence  for each of the enriched glnr-binding regions was extracted using the r package biostrings and submitted to the motif discovery tool multiple em  for motif elicitation   <cit>  to identify a consensus glnr binding motif. a consensus motif  present once in all  <dig> glnr binding sites was identified with an e value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . no direct correlation was observed between either the specific glnr binding sequence, or the proximity of the binding site to a gene start site, and the level of gene expression . to identify key residues required for specific glnr binding we mutated the highly conserved ac-n9-ac and at-n9-ac dna binding motifs. figure  <dig> shows that the highly conserved adenosine residues in the motif are critical as glnr binding is abolished when these residues are mutated. substitution of the ac dinucleotide, with either gg or gc, and the at dinucleotide, with gg or gt, completely abolished glnr binding . the  <dig> base pair distance between these key adenosine residues was also investigated, and we found either increasing this to  <dig> nucleotides or decreasing it to  <dig> base pairs diminished glnr binding .

discussion
in this report we have combined transcriptomics and chip-seq to delineate the regulon controlled by the ompr-type response regulator glnr and to investigate the role m. smegmatis glnr plays in regulating the transcriptomic response to nitrogen limitation.

delineation of the glnr regulon
we compared the global expression profile of m. smegmatis wild type to a Δglnr deletion mutant during nitrogen limitation, and found over  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed , with  <dig> genes up regulated and  <dig> down regulated. this large number of de genes  shows that a major glnr-dependent transcriptomic response is initiated by m. smegmatis during nitrogen limitation. however, not all of these genes are directly regulated by glnr, since the set includes  <dig> genes themselves annotated as response regulators, making the genes under the control of these other response regulators only indirectly controlled by glnr. to identify the directly controlled genes we used chip-seq to identify glnr-dna binding sites and combined this with the transcriptional data.

chip-seq identified  <dig> glnr binding sites in m. smegmatis during nitrogen limitation. forty-four of these are upstream of glnr-dependant transcripts identified in our microarray analysis; controlling  <dig> genes in total, including those predicted to be in operons . glnr can act as a dual transcriptional regulator, both activating and repressing gene expression, as has been shown for other ompr type regulators  <cit> , with approximately 7% of the genes in the m. smegmatis glnr regulon repressed during nitrogen limitation. glnr also controlled the expression of  <dig> pairs of divergently transcribed genes . the genes associated with two glnr regulated genes  were missing absent from the microarray, but qrt-pcr showed msmeg <dig>  encoding an amino acid carrier protein, was under glnr control , whereas msmeg <dig>  encoding a putative tnpa transposase, was not.

the remaining  <dig> glnr-binding sites were not associated with glnr-regulated transcripts. of these, peak  <dig> is located within a coding region and visual inspection of the region indicated it was not a true peak . this was also confirmed by rate limiting qpcr. peaks  <dig> and  <dig> both appear in the promoter region of msmeg <dig>  possibly indicating multiple glnr binding sites for the regulation of this gene; rate limiting qpcr showed enrichment of this and the other  <dig> binding sites . there are  <dig> genes downstream of these  <dig> glnr-binding sites,  <dig> of which are down regulated, but less than  <dig> fold. the remaining  <dig> do not show any significant de, but are included as putative members of the glnr regulon by virtue of the binding sites upstream . in summary, we have demonstrated that the entire glnr regulon during nitrogen limitation consists of a minimum of  <dig> genes.

glnr also binds to  <dig> sites during nitrogen excess , but with significantly lower peak intensity values than observed in nitrogen limitation. these genes may be required for general nitrogen metabolism under all conditions, with increased gene expression required during nitrogen limitation. we have confirmed this experimentally for one of these genes, glna <dig>  which shows a higher basal level of transcription in nitrogen excess compared to other nitrogen genes, but is still induced upon nitrogen limitation  <cit> . the absence of other glnr dna binding sites during nitrogen excess is intriguing, since glnr transcript levels do not differ significantly under high versus low nitrogen levels  <cit> , yet under nitrogen stress glnr protein binds to  <dig> sites. this could imply that the glnr present in nitrogen-rich cells is inactive and is activated during nitrogen limitation, perhaps due to a post-translational modification  and/or the binding of small molecules. either of these processes could promote dimerization during nitrogen limitation to stabilise the protein, resulting in dna binding. alternatively glnr could be sequestered in the cell, perhaps to the cell membrane  <cit> , which would permit a rapid response to nitrogen stress. studies to investigate how glnr is activated during nitrogen limitation are in progress.

role of glnr in primary nitrogen metabolism
as expected, genes that known or predicted to be involved in nitrogen metabolism form the majority in the glnr regulon. we confirmed that the three ammonium transporters  are glnr-regulated during nitrogen limitation  <cit> ; this presumably allows the cell to scavenge available ammonium from the surrounding environment. gs/gogat is the main ammonium assimilation pathway in most bacteria and the other members of this pathway  are also up-regulated by glnr. interestingly the gdh enzyme , which is active until nitrogen becomes limiting, is not glnr regulated. two additional gdh homologs have been proposed   <cit> , but neither are controlled by glnr, so the mechanisms reducing the activity or levels of this enzyme in nitrogen limitation remain unknown.

glutamine synthetase  is a key nitrogen metabolism enzyme, identified as a potential drug target in m. tuberculosis <cit> . four gs are present in mycobacteria , with m. smegmatis containing at least  <dig> genes annotated as putative glutamine synthetases  <cit> . the glna <dig> and glna <dig> genes are found in all mycobacterial genomes together with glne, which regulates glutamine synthetase activity  <cit> . here we show that both glna <dig>  and glna <dig>  are under glnr control but none of the other  <dig> gs homologs are glnr regulated and the function of these enzymes is unknown.

role of glnr in nitrogen scavenging
the largest category of genes in the glnr regulon is nitrogen scavenging. this is logical from an evolutionary perspective, as the soil dwelling m. smegmatis encounters various nitrogen sources in the environment and must compete with other soil microbes for nutrients. twenty-seven genes  encode nitrogen transporter and binding proteins. in addition to the three ammonium transporters, uptake systems for nitrate/nitrite , urea , and amino acids/ peptides  are all up-regulated by glnr in nitrogen limitation. the m. smegmatis genome also encodes enzymes involved in the complete degradation of urea to ammonium suggesting that urea is an important alternative nitrogen source during limiting conditions, however although these urea hydrolysis genes  are up-regulated in m. smegmatis during nitrogen limitation , this is not controlled by glnr.

a similar situation is observed for nitrate/nitrite uptake and assimilation in that m. smegmatis contains two nitrate/nitrite transporters, nark  and nark <dig> , with only nark <dig> up-regulated by glnr; nark is constitutively expressed during nitrogen limitation . for nitrate to be assimilated it must be converted to ammonium via a two-step process; reduction of nitrate to nitrite by nitrate reductase  followed by reduction of nitrite to ammonium by nitrite reductase . as reported previously, and confirmed in this study, the nitrite reductase nirbd enzyme is up regulated by glnr in nitrogen limitation  <cit> , but the nitrate reductase enzyme is not. therefore the uptake and assimilation of nitrite, not nitrate, appears to be an important nitrogen stress response in m. smegmatis. in this study we also identified a glnr regulated transcriptional regulator, nnar , the homologue of which in s. coelicolor is essential for glnr function and growth on nitrate  <cit> . however, the precise role of this regulator and nitrate/nitrite respiration in the nitrogen stress response in m. smegmatis requires further investigation.

one further intriguing observation is that glnr increases the expression of genes encoding enzymes predicted to be involved in processes that break down cellular components into ammonium. for example, an amine oxidase  which break down amines into ammonia and an aldehyde, a urea amidolyase  that converts urea to co <dig> and ammonia, a deaminase  which breaks down nucleotides into nucleosides and ammonia, and several hydrolases which act on carbon-nitrogen bonds  are all glnr regulated. these cellular components may either originate from other organisms in the environment, or from within the cell. for example, e. coli can use its own peptidoglycan d-ala-d-ala as a nitrogen source  <cit> . therefore it is conceivable that in times of extreme nitrogen austerity, mycobacteria could use cellular components to provide the ammonium required for growth and survival in the short term until nitrogen again becomes available.

determination of the glnr binding site motif and key residues
meme identified a  <dig> bp consensus glnr binding sequence of gn2ac-n6gnaaca present once in all the glnr binding sites. streptomyces has a  <dig> bp glnr dna binding motif  <cit> , which is similar to the one identified here. tiffert et al.  proposed the existence of two glnr motifs within the binding motif in s. coelicolor; an “a site”  and a highly conserved “b site” –located  <dig> bp apart–in which the “b site” has a higher affinity for glnr than the “a site”. however, the motif identified in s. venezuelae, gtnac-n6-gtnac only contains two copies of an “a site”. the m. smegmatis glnr binding motif contains two different sites, a variable a-type site  separated by  <dig> bp from a “b site”  that is highly similar to the s. coelicolor “b site” sequence. pullan et al. suggested that conservation of the “b site” might be indicative of strong glnr regulation in terms of gene expression. however, we did not find any correlation between the presence or absence of the b-site. for example msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> have the b-site, whilst msmeg <dig>  msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> do not, yet all exhibit similar differential gene expression . consequently the conserved “b site” is not the sole determinant of the strength of glnr regulation, and additional transcription factors may contribute. however, there is a highly conserved ac-n9-ac motif present in both m. smegmatis and streptomyces, and we have shown that spacing between the dinucleotides, as well as the presence of adenosine are both crucial for glnr binding. the  <dig> bp distance between these adenosine residues represents one turn of the major groove of the dna helix, ensuring both are available to interact with glnr.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have demonstrated that glnr is the global nitrogen response regulator in m. smegmatis, directly regulating the expression of more than  <dig> genes. glnr controls key nitrogen stress survival processes including primary nitrogen metabolism pathways, the ability to utilise nitrate and urea as alternative nitrogen sources, and the potential to use cellular components to provide a source of ammonium. although we have shown that glnr plays a central role in nitrogen metabolism in mycobacteria, several questions remain unanswered. for instance, the mechanism of activation of glnr is not known. glnr is an orphan response regulator and the corresponding kinase  has not yet been identified. investigations are also in progress to identify the signal indicating cellular nitrogen status and the mechanisms by which this signal is detected and translated into glnr activation. these studies are important for furthering our understanding of how mycobacteria survive nutrient limiting conditions.
