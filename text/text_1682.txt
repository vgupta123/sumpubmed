BACKGROUND
serine/arginine  protein-specific kinases  represent a class of evolutionarily conserved kinases that specifically phosphorylate the arginine/serine-rich  domains of the sr splicing factor  <cit> . after the identification of srpk1–the first srpk–by gui et al.  <cit> , other srpks such as srpk <dig>  <cit> , mouse srpk <dig> and srpk <dig>  <cit> , yeast dsk <dig>  <cit>  and sky1p  <cit> , nematode spk- <dig>  <cit> , trypanosoma cruzi tcsrpk  <cit> , and arabidopsis thaliana srpk <dig>  <cit>  have been subsequently identified. some studies have shown that srpks are mainly localized in the cytoplasm, with only a few present in the nucleus . the srpks that are localized in the cytoplasm regulate the nuclear import of sr proteins via phosphorylation  <cit> , while those in the nucleus regulate the nuclear localization of the sr splicing proteins via phosphorylation  <cit> . ding et al.  <cit>  have discovered that the spacer sequences present between the conserved domains of mammalian srpks have cytoplasmic anchoring function. however, there has been no report on the nuclear localization signal  of srpks.

model organism physarum polycephalum is mitochondria-containing primitive eukaryotes. its life cycle includes a single-celled amoeba, plasmodium , and sporulation stages. the nuclei in the same plasmodium proliferate by way of synchronization of mitosis. in our previous study, we identified an srpk containing  <dig> amino acids  from p. polycephalum; this kinase was termed psrpk . similar to other srpks, psrpk also has  <dig> conserved domains and can phosphorylate human sr protein alternate splicing factor/splicing factor  <dig> . however, it differs from other srpks in that the divergent motif  in its n-terminus is rich in acidic amino acids; the spacer sequence of psrpk between two conserved domains is shorter than that of other srpks. in this study, the distribution of psrpk fluorescent fusion protein in mammalian cells was observed using laser scanning confocal microscopy. maximum fluorescence was detected in the nucleus, suggesting the existence of an nls in psrpk. when the distribution of truncated psprk peptides was observed, a putative nls was found in the c-terminal of psrpk based on its homology to the classic nls. when the sequence was deleted or when lysine  <dig> in the sequence was substitute by threonine, the cytoplasmic distribution of psrpk was observed.

methods
construction of expression plasmids containing psrpk and truncated psprk peptides
pmd18-psrpk had been constructed previously  <cit> . psrpk fragments were obtained by polymerase chain reaction , using pmd18-psrpk as the template and psrpk-specific primers . the resulting pcr fragments and the mammalian expression vectors pdsred1-n <dig> and pecfp-c <dig>  were digested with ecori and bamhi. the digested fragments were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, recovered from the gel, purified, and ligated using t <dig> dna ligase; this resulted in the expression plasmids pdsred-psrpk and pecfp-psrpk.

we designed the following truncated psrpk peptides : tp <dig> , tp <dig> , tp <dig> , tp <dig> , tp <dig> , tp <dig> , tp7~tp <dig> . recombinant plasmids were constructed using the primer pairs  and the pmd18-psrpk, pdsred1-n <dig>  and pecfp-c <dig> vectors, resulting in pecfp-tp1~pecfp-tp <dig>  pdsred-tp <dig>  pdsred-tp <dig>  pdsred-tp <dig>  pdsred-tp <dig>  and pdsred-tp <dig> 

construction of expression plasmids containing mutant and default psrpk peptides
in order to understand the effect of the loop motif on nuclear localization, we designed default psrpk, namely, psrpkd  and mutant psrpk, namely, psrpkm . the dna fragments containing psrpkd or psrpkm up- and downstream were obtained using the primers listed in table  <dig> and pmd18-psrpk as the template. the  <dig> overlapping pcr products were mixed in a ratio of 1: <dig>  followed by denaturing at 94°c for  <dig> min and annealing at 55°c for  <dig> min. since there were  <dig> complementary bases  in the  <dig> pcr fragments, they would be complementary to the cohesive ends during annealing at 55°c. the dna with 5' and 3' overhangs could be extended by dna polymerase  to form a complete dna fragment at 72°c. primer pair f4/r <dig> were introduced in the pcr reaction for the amplification of the psrpkd and psrpkm sequences. the  <dig> pcr products, psrpkd and psrpkm, were inserted into pdsred1-n <dig>  resulting in the recombinant plasmids pdsred-psrpkd and pdsred-psrpkm, respectively.

transfection of mammalian cells with lipofectamine
the abovementioned recombinant plasmids were used to transform e. coli dh5a cells. the positive recombinant products were grown in luria-bertani  medium containing  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin. the plasmids were isolated using the alkaline lysis method, dissolved in tris-edta  buffer, and quantified using genequant pro . the purified plasmid  was diluted to  <dig> μg/ml in serum-free rpmi- <dig> medium . lipofectamine™  <dig>  was diluted in serum-free rpmi- <dig> medium  and then mixed with an identical volume of plasmid solution, resulting in lipid-dna complexes.

hela and l <dig> cells  were cultured in rpmi- <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> iu/ml penicillin, and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. the cells were harvested while they were in the logarithmic phase and  <dig>  ml culture  was seeded into a 35-mm plate with a coverslip and cultured for  <dig> h. the medium was replaced with serum-free rpmi- <dig> medium, and the cells were cultured for  <dig> h to initiate transfection. the cells were overlaid with  <dig> μl lipid-dna complexes and cultured for  <dig> h. the medium was replaced with  <dig>  ml of 10% fbs medium, and the cells were further cultured for  <dig> h.

staining of cells with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
the hela cells were transfected with pecfp-psrpk, and l <dig> cells were transfected with pecfp-psrpk, pdsred-psrpk, pdsred-tp5~pdsred-tp <dig>  pdsred-psrpkd and pdsred-psrpkm as described above, respectively. the transfected cells were incubated on a coverslip for  <dig> h, following which dapi staining  was performed for  <dig> min. the cells were washed  <dig> times  with d-hands solution to remove dapi. fluorescence was visualized under a fluorescence microscope  or a confocal microscope  at 465~ <dig> nm  or 560~ <dig> nm  in order to observe the distribution of the fluorescent fusion protein in the cells.

three-dimensional structure modeling of psrpk
the three-dimensional  psrpk structure was modeled by the swiss institute of bioinformatics program swiss-model, available at , and the results analyzed by the deepview program  <cit> .

RESULTS
psrpk was mainly localized in the nucleus of mammalian cells
the dapi-stained nucleus of cells hela and l <dig> transfected with pecfp-psrpk were clearly observed under uv excitation . confocal microscopy showed that the distribution of cyan fluorescent protein -psrpk was non-uniform and that this protein was expressed mainly in the nucleus of the hela  and l <dig>  cells.

existence of an nls on the c-terminal conserved domain of psrpk
the expression and distribution of cfp fusion tp <dig>  tp <dig>  tp <dig>  and tp <dig> in mammalian cells were observed by confocal microscopy. compare with the dapi staining of the nucleus , the distribution of cfp-tp <dig> in hela  and l <dig>  cells was similar to that of cfp-psrpk, i.e., both mainly accumulated in the nucleus. this suggested that the deletion of ≥ n had no significant effect on the nuclear accumulation of psrpk. the distributions of cfp-tp <dig> and cfp-tp <dig> in hela  and l <dig>  cells were similar to those of cfp-prpk and cfp-tp <dig>  i.e., both mainly accumulated in the nucleus. this indicated that psrpk continued to accumulate in the nucleus despite the deletion of ≥ n, cd <dig>  and the spacer sequence and that cd <dig> contains an nls peptide. unlike the distributions of cfp-psrpk, cfp-tp <dig>  cfp-tp <dig>  and cfp-tp <dig>  cfp-tp <dig> in hela  and l <dig>  cells exhibited diffuse distribution. the results above indicated that the ≥ n, cd <dig>  and spacer sequence deletions did not influence nuclear localization of psrpk and that an nls was located in the c-terminal conserved domain of psrpk.

psrpk nls was located in the 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> sequence
confocal microscopy revealed that rfp-tp <dig> and rfp-tp <dig> were uniformly distributed in the l <dig> cells , indicating that there was no nls in the tp <dig> and tp <dig> sequences. however, rfp-tp <dig> mainly accumulated in the nucleus , indicating that an nls existed in tp <dig>  by comparing the amino acid sequences of tp <dig>  tp <dig>  and tp <dig>  we primarily confirmed that psrpk nls was located in 318pkkgdkydktd <dig>  rfp-tp <dig> and rfp-tp <dig> were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm ; this further indicated that psrpk and tp <dig> lost the ability of nuclear localization after the deletion of the abovementioned sequence. thus, we could confirm that 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> was the nls sequence of psrpk.

the nls sequence of psrpk contained a Ω-loop motif
analysis of the secondary structure of 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> within psrpk by dnasis v <dig>  demo revealed that it was a β-turn . based on the crystal structure of srpk <dig> and sky1p  <cit> , the tertiary structure of psrpk  was predicted using swiss-model software  <cit> . figure 5b shows that the structure 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> mimics that of the corresponding sequences of srpk <dig> and sky1p. all the  <dig> sequences are located in the c-terminal loop motif. the spatially near k <dig> and d <dig> may form a salt-bridge via their side chains, causing the 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> to form a stable Ω-loop. this structure of 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> changes after 318pkkgdk <dig> deletion or k <dig> → t <dig> mutation, as predicted by swiss-model software . 318pkkgdk <dig> deletion causes damage to the Ω-loop motif, and k <dig> → t <dig> mutation damages the salt-bridge in the Ω-loop.

the fluorescent fusion proteins psrpkd and psrpkm in the l <dig> cells are shown in figure  <dig>  compare with the dapi staining of the nuclear , the fluorescent signal of rfp-psrpkd and rfp-psrpkm was observed in cytoplasm . further, confocal microcopy revealed that rfp-psrpkd and rfp-psrpkm were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm ; this indicated that the 318pkkgdk <dig> deletion or k <dig> → t <dig> mutation destroyed the structure of psrpk nls, resulting in psrpk losing its ability of nuclear localization.

discussion
psrpk has an nls sequence
ding et al.  <cit>  studied the cell localization of mammalian srpks and found that almost all srpks without spacer sequences are accumulated in the nucleus, indicating that there is a cytoplasm localization signal in the spacer sequence between the conserved domains. kuroyanagi et al.  <cit>  speculated that mouse srpk <dig> might have  <dig> potential nlss that are located in 11~ <dig> aa and 265~ <dig> aa; thus, msrpk <dig> may have a potential nls in 264~ <dig> aa. however, direct evidence of nls sequences in srpk family members has been lacking thus far. laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that rfps of default psrpks containing 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> mainly accumulated in the nucleus of mammalian cells, while the psrpks in which the abovementioned sequence was deleted did not accumulate in the nucleus. this indicated that the nls of psrpk was located in the 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> sequence of the c-terminal conserved domain.

further, ding et al.  <cit>  showed that mammalian srpks were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. however, the results obtained in our study showed that psrpk was mainly expressed in the nucleus of the mammalian cells. a comparison of the primary structure of psrpk and other srpks revealed that the conserved domains were almost identical; however, the nonconserved ≥ n and spacer sequence differed among the kinases. a cytoplasm localization signal was present in the spacer sequences of mammalian srpks. further, the spacer sequence of psrpk was considerably smaller than that of mammalian srpks. this difference might be the major reason why psrpk cannot anchor itself in the mammalian cytoplasm.

function of the psrpk nls is related to the loop motif
a classic nls  comprises a monopartite or bipartite signal. a monopartite nls contains  <dig> cluster of basic residues, while a bipartite nls contains  <dig> clusters of basic residues  <cit> . similar to the sequence feature of a monopartite nls, the nls of psrpk is rich in basic residues. a monopartite nls sequence that is located at the terminal of a protein is usually in a coil, while that located in the interior of a protein is usually in a loop. the psrpk nls is also located in the basic loop between  <dig> α-helixes . the close side chains of k <dig> and d <dig> form a salt bridge, thus forming a stable nls Ω-loop motif . the experimental results showed that psrpk lost its nuclear localization ability following the deletion of  <dig> pkkgdk <dig> or mutation from k <dig> to t <dig>  the deletion or mutation destroyed the Ω-loop motif of psrpk, thus suggesting that the loop structure of psrpk nls controls the nuclear localization of psrpk. the 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> sequence, which corresponds to the nonconserved sequences of srpk <dig> and sky1p, is located in the loop of an hlhm  <cit>  . therefore, studies on nlss of srpks should focus on the loops in hlhms.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, by truncation of psrpk protein, deletion of and single amino acid substitution in a putative nls and transfection of mammalian cells, we demonstrated that the 318pkkgdkydktd <dig> peptides localized in the c-terminal conserved domain of psrpk with the Ω-loop structure could play a crucial role in the nls function of psrpk.
