BACKGROUND
an estimated  <dig>  burn injuries were treated in hospitals and clinics in the united states in  <dig>  <cit> . approximately 10% of burn injury cases require hospitalization for intensive medical treatment, and bacterial infection is one of the major causes of burn-related deaths  <cit> . because thermal injury of the normal skin barrier results in depression of local and systemic immune responses and results in host protein leakage into necrotic tissues, pathogenic microbes efficiently proliferate and colonize in burn wound areas  <cit> . among the various species of bacteria isolated from burn wounds, p. aeruginosa represents one of the principal pathogens  <cit> . gram-negative, naturally antibiotic-resistant p. aeruginosa persistently infects burn wounds, delays wound recovery, and subsequently interferes with clinical therapies  <cit> . thus, it is important to both control p. aeruginosa complications in the early stages of burn injury and reduce the risk of septic shock in burn patients  <cit> .

management of burn wounds requires comprehensive measures. fluid resuscitation, pain control, pulmonary care, nutritional support, surgical debridement, and other intensive treatments are important considerations for severe burn injuries  <cit> . topical or systemic applications of antimicrobial agents have also been shown to protect patients with burn wounds from subsequent bacterial infections. however, the therapeutic effects of antibiotics against bacterial invasion appear to be limited, especially in severe cases of burn injuries  <cit> , and antibiotic use often induces complications involving the development of antibiotic-resistant strains  <cit> . to be controlled, these resistant strains need even more and stronger measures of antibiotics, or damages may develop further into septic consequences. controversy over antibiotics in burn patient treatments can be also seen in the fact that burn-injured children treated with antibiotics exhibit higher infection rates and poorer prognosis during sepsis than non-treated children  <cit> . moreover, in cases of patients with a burn injury of more than 40% of the total body surface area, subsequent secondary bacterial infections are difficult to be controlled with antibiotic intervention alone  <cit> .

found in vertebrates and invertebrates, defensins which are small, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides may be an alternative measure against antibiotics-resistant bacteria  <cit> . two main classes of defensins, α- and β-defensins, have been studied in the context of bacterial infections  <cit> . among the many subfamilies of β-defensins, we focused on human β-defensin  <dig> , which can be found in testes, epithelial surfaces of thyroid glands, lungs, uterus, and kidneys, because it displayed a strong antimicrobial activity, especially against p. aeruginosa  <cit> . however, due to the relatively small size of the hbd <dig> molecule, a stable, high-yield delivery platform is required for the successful expression of the protein in target tissues  <cit> . recently, an adenovirus vector has been used to deliver human β-defensin  <dig> into normal human skin cells  <cit> . however, use of the adenoviral vector has been criticized for poor gene delivery efficacy and safety issues  <cit> . anti-adenoviral patient antibodies might represent another hurdle preventing the clinical use of adenoviral vectors  <cit> . instead, we utilized a paramyxoviridae avian newcastle disease virus . the ndv has been recognized for its efficacy as a rna viral vector not only for cancer therapies  <cit>  but also for vaccine constructs  <cit> . approved safety and superior expression efficiency for the inserted foreign gene add another merit to the usefulness of the ndv vector in humans  <cit> .

in this study, we present the feasibility of hbd <dig> for the protection of burn wounds from secondary pseudomonal manifestation. inserted into the recombinant ndv construct, hbd <dig> was effectively delivered right into the burn-injured epithelial layer of mice, and promoted skin healing as complete as an unburned control even in the event of concurrent p. aeruginosa infection.

cells and viruses
human lung epithelial a <dig>  human laryngeal cancer hep- <dig>  madin-darby canine kidney , and madin-darby bovine kidney  cells were obtained from the american type culture collection . primary human dermal fibroblast  cells were obtained from modern cell and tissue technologies . primary chicken embryo fibroblast  cells were established from fertile chicken eggs . cells were maintained in appropriate media and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin, and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin .

newcastle disease viruses were propagated in fertilized chicken eggs, and the viral presence was confirmed by hemagglutination assay  using  <dig> %  chicken erythrocytes and by sequence analysis using reverse transcriptase-pcr  method.

generation of recombinant ndv expressing hbd <dig> 
human beta-defensin  <dig>  was amplified by pcr using testes cdnas of the human total rna master panel ii . the sequences of primers are 5′-gcagccccagcattatgcag-3′ for sense and 5′-aagctactgagg tcctactt-3′ for anti-sense. after sequence confirmation, hbd <dig> was inserted into a specific restriction enzyme site, sacii, between p and m genes of the ndv/lasota  to generate the ndv-hbd <dig> plasmid . a set of ndv primers, 3013p  and 3430m  were used to confirm pndv-hbd <dig> construction. to rescue the recombinant ndv-hbd <dig>  virus, pndv-hbd <dig> and supporting plasmids  were transfected into a <dig> cells.  <dig> h later, transfected cells were co-cultured with cef cells and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  co-cultured cell supernatants were inoculated into fertilized chicken eggs for rndv-hbd <dig> propagation.

gfp expression levels in various cells by recombinant ndv infection
a <dig>  hep- <dig>  mdck, mdbk, hdf, and cef cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/well. with the approximately 80 ~ 90% confluent cell density, cells were infected with the recombinant ndv expressing green fluorescent protein  at the same multiplicity of infection  for  <dig> h. at  <dig> h post-infection , expressed gfp intensity was measured in triplicate.

immunofluorescence confocal assay
to detect hbd <dig> expression, mdbk cells  were cultured directly on the 24-well plates with glass coverslips and infected with the rndv-hbd <dig> at an moi of  <dig> for  <dig> h. at  <dig> hpi, golgi stop protein transport inhibitor  was treated for  <dig> h. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in pbs . after treated with pbst containing bovine serum albumin , ndv proteins and expressed hbd <dig> were detected primarily with polyclonal rabbit anti-ndv antibody and monoclonal mouse anti-hbd <dig> antibody, respectively. then, texas red conjugated anti-rabbit antibody  and alexa  <dig> conjugated anti-mouse antibody  were used as secondary antibodies. hoechst  <dig>  was used for cell nucleus detection. the cells were imaged with a lsm  <dig> meta lno laser scanning microscope  at korea basic science institute, chuncheon, korea. pbs-infected samples were used as a control.

quantification of hbd <dig> with elisa
to quantify hbd <dig> expression, mdbk cells were infected with the rndv-hbd <dig> at an moi of  <dig>  at  <dig> hpi, cell supernatants were collected and prepared with the centrifugal filter  for 1: <dig>  1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> dilutions. hbd <dig> was then quantified in triplicate using polyclonal rabbit anti-hbd <dig> antibody and hbd <dig> peptide  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . cell culture media and rndv-infected cell supernatants were used as controls.

in vitro inhibition efficacy of hbd <dig> against p. aeruginosa
mdbk cells were infected with the rndv-hbd <dig> at an moi of  <dig> for  <dig> h, and cell supernatants were collected at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively. the cell supernatants were then mixed with the same volume of p. aeruginosa , which was obtained from korean culture center for microorganisms , and the mixtures were incubated at 37°c, 5% co <dig> for  <dig> h. each mixture was spread onto lb agar plate and incubated at 37°c, 5% co <dig> for  <dig> h. p. aeruginosa colonies were counted using chemidoc xrs + . cell culture media and rndv-infected cell supernatants were used as controls.

in vivo inhibition efficacy of hbd <dig> against p. aeruginosa in burn-injured mouse skin
to make burn wounds, balb/c mice  were anesthetized with the combination of xylazine  and zoletil . mice were then shaved on their back skin and burned with a square-shaped brass pole , being heated up to 100°c and sterilized by an alcohol lamp for ~ <dig> seconds. right after burn procedure, the damaged skin of mice was infected with  <dig> μl of p. aeruginosa  via subcutaneous injection. for the expression of hbd <dig> in the burn wounds, mdbk cells were infected with the rndv-hbd <dig> at an moi of  <dig>  at  <dig> hpi, the cells  were injected subcutaneously in the burn-injured, p. aeruginosa-infected skin of mice. the rndv-infected mdbk cells were used for the treatment of a control mouse group. mice were grouped as b , b/p , b/p/n , and b/p/h .

statistics
statistical significance of gfp expression in cells  and hbd <dig> expression  was assessed by unpaired, two-tailed student’s t test . one-way anova was applied to that of the colony count of p. aeruginosa  and skin recovery   results and confirmed by tukey’s multiple comparison test.

RESULTS
generation of the rndv-hbd <dig> virus
we first engineered a full-length plasmid of the ndv/lasota strain  as a viral vector to express hbd <dig>  . using the constructed pndv-hbd <dig>  we rescued the rndv-hbd <dig> virus by plasmid-based reverse genetics as described previously  <cit> . at  <dig> days post-transfection, ha positive samples were inoculated into fertilized chicken eggs for the propagation of the rndv-hbd <dig> virus. to confirm the rescue of the rndv-hdb <dig> virus, the egg allantoic fluids were used for the reverse transcriptase-pcr . the hbd4-inserted t vector was used as a control. when using the hbd <dig> primer set , we detected the hbd <dig> nucleotide  size of pcr products in two stocks of the rndv-hbd <dig> virus and in the hbd4-inserted t vector control . however, the ndv 3013p and 3430m primers set yielded ~  <dig> nt size rt-pcr products only in the rndv-hbd <dig> samples due to the insertion of hbd <dig> between ndv p and m genes whereas only ~ <dig> nt size product was detected in the wild-type  ndv/lasota virus . these results confirmed the right insertion of hbd <dig> into the ndv virus and the generation of the rndv-hbd <dig> virus.figure  <dig>

hbd <dig> expression from the rndv-hbd <dig> virus
burn-damaged skin may not support sustained hbd <dig> expression after the rndv-hbd <dig> infection. hence, we needed an intermediate host suitable for ndv infection and hbd <dig> expression. using the rndv-gfp virus, we screened various cells. among  <dig> different cells tested , mdbk cells expressed the strongest gfp signals . in the subsequent experiment only using mdbk and a <dig> cells, better gfp signals were determined in mdbk cells than in a <dig> cells . based on these results, we decided to use mdbk cells for the rndv-hbd <dig> application against the pseudomonal attack in burn injury.figure  <dig> 
evaluation of hbd <dig> expression in rndv-hbd4-infected cells.  a <dig>  hep- <dig>  mdck, mdbk, hdf, and cef cells were infected with the rndv-gfp virus and assessed for gfp expression .  mdbk cells were infected with the rndv-hbd <dig> and treated with golgistop™, and hbd <dig> , ndv proteins , and the cell nuclei  were detected in a confocal microscopy.  mdbk cells were infected with the rndv-hbd <dig>  and the expressed hbd <dig> in the cell supernatants was quantified at  <dig> hpi by elisa .  the expressed ndv proteins were also quantified and the mock-infected cell supernatants were used as a control.



we then detected hbd <dig>  expressed in mdbk cells after rndv-hbd <dig> infection. to trap expressed hbd <dig> inside the cells, mdbk cells were treated with golgistop™ protein transport inhibitor. as seen in a pbs-infected control, hbd <dig> was barely detectable without golgistop treatment . however, golgistop treatment possibly inhibited hbd <dig> secretion into cell supernatants, and hbd <dig> was well detected along in the rndv-hbd4-infected mdbk cells . these results indicated hbd <dig> could be expressed from rndv-hdb <dig> virus infection in mdbk cells.

however, hbd <dig> was also detected in the mock-infected  and rndv-infected cell supernatants . as mentioned above, defensins can be found in various kinds of cells of living organisms. this might explain why hbd <dig> was detected in controls. to verify whether hbd <dig> expression was increased by rndv-hbd <dig> virus infection, we determined the amount of ndv proteins using the same cell supernatants of figure 2c. in 10-, 50-, and 100-fold diluted cell supernatants, we detected the proportional increases of ndv proteins whereas no trace of ndv was detected in the mock-infected control . considered together, these results indicate that hbd <dig> can be well expressed into the cell supernatants from rndv-hbd <dig> virus infection in mdbk cells.

inhibition efficacy of hbd <dig> against p. aeruginosa
next, the in vitro inhibitory efficacy of hbd <dig> was evaluated against p. aeruginosa. to inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa in cell culture media, we added the rndv-hbd4-infected mdbk cell supernatants  directly into the penicillin-free rpmi  <dig> media, in which  <dig> cfu of p. aeruginosa would be growing. we then counted the number of colonies after spreading p. aeruginosa-hbd <dig> mixture onto penicillin-free lb agar plates. surprisingly,  <dig> % and  <dig> % reduction rates in the number of p. aeruginosa colonies were determined with the respective  <dig>  and  <dig>  hpi supernatants of rndv-hbd4-infected mdbk cells, compared with that  of the mock-infected cell supernatant . this meant that more amounts of hbd <dig> might be expressed into the cell supernatant at  <dig> hpi than at  <dig> hpi and that hbd <dig> effectively inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa.figure  <dig>

p. aeruginosa
infection in burn wounds in a mouse model.  after infection with the rndv-hbd <dig>  mdbk cell supernatants were collected at  <dig> or  <dig> hpi and mixed with p. aeruginosa  at 37°c. the number of p. aeruginosa colonies in penicillin-free lb agar plates was quantified and compared with the number of colonies in the mock-infected samples .  the back skin of mice was burned using a heated square brass pole . p. aeruginosa infection was added in the b/p mice group, and the b/p/h mice group was treated with the rndv-hbd4-infected mdbk cells. mice treated with rndv-infected mdbk cells were used as a control group. representative photos from each group were presented for comparison. at  <dig> days post-burn, skin swab samples were plated onto cetrimide agar plates to determine p. aeruginosa colony counts .  skin recovery was determined by averaging the relative burn wound area and compared with those of the b group  .



to assess the in vivo inhibition efficacy of hbd <dig> against p. aeruginosa in the burn wounds, we used a surrogate burn injury mouse model. mice were grouped as b , b/p , b/p/n , and b/p/h . normal mice treated with pbs represented the control group . during  <dig> days of observation, mice in the b group experienced severe skin injuries  and exhibited less physical activity, including reduced drinking and eating habits . more severe skin damage was observed in the b/p mice . their burn wounds were larger than those of the b group and were colonized with the greatest number  of p. aeruginosa . mice treated with the rndv-infected mdbk cells were also colonized with a similar number  of p. aeruginosa and experienced almost the same burn and bacterial infection sequelae as seen in those of the b/p group . however, the b/p/h mice, which were treated with rndv-hbd4-infected mdbk cells, showed the most rapid skin recovery . compared with the b, b/p, and b/p/n mice, p. aeruginosa was barely detected in the injured skin of the b/p/h mice  . at  <dig> days post-burn, only small skin contractures remained in the b/p/h mice as burn scars, and their skin had recovered as completely as the control mice . these results suggest that hbd <dig> expressed from rndv protects burn wounds from subsequent p. aeruginosa infection.

discussion
hbd <dig> is a known antimicrobial peptide  <cit> . however, it is difficult to utilize such a small peptide in currently available expression systems. we solved this problem by using the ndv vector. the ndv has been previously described as a highly useful vector for its oncolytic property in cancer therapy, stable expression efficiency as a vaccine platform, and relative safety in human applications because its rna genome was not able to integrate into dna chromosome  <cit> . these features make the ndv a better candidate than any other viral vectors in future clinical purposes.

additionally, ndv itself has been known as a strong immune inducer  <cit> . however, treatment with ndv-infected mdbk cells did not benefit the burn-injured and subsequently p. aeruginosa-infected skin of mice in our model . in our animal model, we complicated the burn wounds with p. aeruginosa infection, and only the mice treated with rndv-hbd4-infected mdbk cells overcame the supplementary pseudomonal exacerbation . the actual p. aeruginosa colony number was also extremely reduced only in the b/p/h mice . with evident efficacy against p. aeruginosa , these results imply that hbd <dig> can inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa and intensify the rndv-hbd <dig> effectiveness in burn wound therapy against the secondary bacterial complications.

mdbk cell-based application of hbd <dig> may be rejected for clinical application in humans. due to this limitation, we also included human-origin cells including a <dig>  hep- <dig>  and hdf cells in the initial test to select the best-fit cell candidate for the ndv-foreign gene expression . however, all these human cells were insufficient for foreign gene expression, compared with mdbk cells, and excluded in further analysis. in this screening process, the rndv-gfp virus which is very sensitive to the interferon  activation was used because the gfp expression can be dependent on the ifn level synthesized in the infected cells. therefore, the gfp intensity might determine which cell line could be suitable for the foreign gene expression from the rndv.

the direct application of hbd <dig> expression plasmid or rndv-hbd <dig> virus into the burn-injured skin layers may be also considered. however, burn-injured skin may not effectively support hbd <dig> expression and may require aseptic surgical debridement for normal skin regeneration or replacement surgery  <cit> . also, in severe cases of burn injury, the dermal skin layer can be affected, and destructions in nerves and blood vessels may result in subsequent bacterial colonization in the burn wounds  <cit> . hence, we used an intermediate host, the mdbk cells, to express hbd <dig> in burn-injured skin layers. for the application of rndv-hbd <dig> virus in human burn injuries, ndv-susceptible human cells or synthetic tissue scaffolds harboring them may need to be engineered for efficient hbd <dig> expression in burn wounds.

CONCLUSIONS
herein, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of the rndv-hbd <dig> virus against p. aeruginosa infection in burn wounds. as an alternative clinical measure in burn wound remedies, hbd <dig> was applied to protect the burned skin of mice from p. aeruginosa complication, resulting in marked skin recovery. although suitable cell lines or any equivalents, in addition to mdbk cells, should be further evaluated for the clinical application of rndv-hbd <dig> in severe cases of burn injuries in humans, our results potentiate the therapeutic index of hbd <dig> and the use of the ndv vector in human cases of burn injury.
