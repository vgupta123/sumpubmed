BACKGROUND
genetic populations provide the basis for a wide range of genetic and genomic studies and many types of populations have been used for genetic mapping, gene discovery and genomics-assisted breeding. construction and utilization of a suitable genetic population is pivotal for fine mapping and map-based cloning of quantitative trait genes, the most general strategy in plant molecular genetics and genomics.

over the past few decades, many different types of populations have been used to identify and map quantitative trait loci . a large number of these have been mapped to putative genomic regions, but few have been fine-mapped or cloned  <cit> . researchers have attributed this to several factors including insufficient population size, unstable statistical thresholds for detecting putative loci, using a minimal number of molecular markers for analyses, and the low heritability of target traits  <cit> . however, the main reason for a lack of fine-mapping or cloning is the limitations of the populations used.

early temporary primary mapping populations such as the f2: <dig> and bc <dig> families have been used for genetic analysis and a number of qtls with relatively large effects have been detected  <cit> . however, these types of populations are difficult to maintain and trials cannot be repeated as the same genetic composition can only be used once  <cit> . therefore, it is difficult to produce convincing mapping results. to facilitate the genetic analysis of complex traits, some permanent primary mapping populations such as doubled haploid  and recombinant inbred lines  have been developed. however, whilst these populations can be utilized in genetic and genomic studies, they are not adequate for further analysis such as fine mapping and characterization of target qtls  <cit> .

advanced backcross populations have been developed and used, with near-isogenic lines  being the most representative type. nils have distinct advantages for qtl identification; genetic background noise can be eliminated and a qtl can be visualized as a single mendelian factor. each nil carries either one or more donor segments in the near-isogenic background of the recurrent parent, which reduces the effects of interference from the genetic background. several qtls have been fine-mapped or cloned on the basis of the nils  <cit> . however, development is laborious and time-consuming, preventing many researchers from performing map-based cloning of qtls  <cit> .

doi et al. and kubo et al. suggested that the development of chromosome segment substitution lines  was a viable alternative for resolving issues that emerged during efforts to achieve precise mapping of qtls  <cit> . cssls are a series of nils in which the substituted segments of the wide population contain the entire information of the donor, while each cssl carries one or more donor chromosome segments in the genetic background of the recipient. the main characteristic of cssls is that the substituted segments of each cssl are stable. as a result, cssls are useful for genetic studies in terms of the detection and fine mapping of qtls for genome-wide target traits, and for studying the interactions between qtls. in addition, secondary f <dig> populations can be derived from a further back-cross between a selected cssl and the recurrent parent, which can then be used for the fine mapping and positional cloning of interesting qtls  <cit> . to date, several cssls in rice have been developed, and many qtls for traits of agronomic importance have been detected in this way  <cit> . these achievements have undoubtedly enhanced the understanding of complex traits and promoted plant genomic studies.

previously reported cssls were selected via marker-assisted selection  and genotyped using limited markers. it is suggested that the substituted segments from the donor were discovered exactly and the genetic background of each cssl was detected accurately, as there was a limited number of molecular markers and double-crossovers were always present. next-generation sequencing technology provides the capacity for parallel sequencing of genomes and the development of a sequencing-based high-throughput genotyping method that combines the advantages of ultrahigh-dense marker coverage and eliminates the likelihood of overlooking double-crossovers. the technology ensures high mapping accuracy and resolution, and more comparable genome and genetic maps among the mapping populations  <cit> . since  <dig>  two rice rils have been accurately genotyped using high-throughput techniques based on whole-genome re-sequencing and ultrahigh-density linkage maps were constructed for qtl mapping  <cit> .

in this study, a broad population that consisted of  <dig> cssls was developed. the population was derived from a cross between two sequenced rice cultivars:  <dig>  an elite restorer indica cultivar as the recipient, and nipponbare, a japonica cultivar as the donor. to identify the genetic background and exact length of the substituted segments, and subsequently enhance the accuracy of the qtl mapping, the cssls were subjected to high-throughput genotyping by whole-genome re-sequencing with  <dig> Ã— genome sequence per line, and an ultrahigh-quality physical map was constructed. using the bin map converted from the ultrahigh-quality physical map associated with the culm length  of the  <dig> cssls, the qtl analysis mapped nine qtls, explaining  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for cl. a qtl of large effect was located in a  <dig>  bp region that contained the rice 'green revolution' gene. the other qtls were mapped to their specific intervals on rice chromosomes. this research will facilitate fine mapping and cloning of quantitative trait genes, providing foundations enabling the development of superior rice varieties. furthermore, it will become possible to illustrate the genetic mechanisms of complex traits in plant functional genomics.

RESULTS
polymorphisms detected by ssr and insertion/deletion  markers between the two parents
a total of  <dig> markers were used in this study to survey the polymorphisms between  <dig> and nipponbare . of these,  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers were selected and information regarding these was downloaded http://www.gramene.org,  <dig> insertion/deletion  markers were developed using primer premier  <dig>  software according to the publicly available rice genome sequence comparisons that have been prepared for nipponbare and  <dig> http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp. of the  <dig> markers,  <dig>  displayed polymorphisms between  <dig> and nipponbare. the average size of the interval between two polymorphic markers was  <dig>  mb on the rice physical map . the polymorphic markers were utilized further for mas in the process of the development of cssls and genotyping the  <dig> cssls.

cssl development
the cssl development procedure is summarized in figure  <dig>  the f <dig> plants were generated from  <dig> 'female' and nipponbare 'male' parents. the f <dig> plants were back-crossed to  <dig> to produce the bc1f <dig> generation. these bc1f <dig> plants were back-crossed with  <dig> to produce bc2f <dig>  using the same method,  <dig> bc4f <dig> individuals were obtained. these bc4f <dig> plants were back-crossed with  <dig> to produce bc5f <dig>  which contained  <dig> lines, and were self-crossed to produce  <dig> bc4f <dig> lines. mas with a whole-genome survey of  <dig> bc4f <dig> and  <dig> bc5f <dig> individuals, which were selected at random by taking one from each line, identified  <dig> plants in which the majority of genomic regions were homozygous for  <dig> alleles; one to five heterozygous substituted segments from nipponbare were the exception. sixty-three plants that had one or two substituted segments were self-crossed to produce the bc4f <dig> and bc5f <dig> lines. subsequently,  <dig> plants from each line were genotyped with the polymorphic markers on the target-substituted segments to select plants that had one or two homozygous substituted segments from nipponbare; seventy plants were obtained. the remaining  <dig> plants, which had three to five substituted segments, were back-crossed with  <dig> to produce the bc5f <dig> and bc6f <dig> lines, and these plants were self-crossed to produce bc5f <dig> and bc6f <dig> lines, respectively. twenty plants from each line were genotyped on the target region to select plants that had between one and three homozygous substituted segments from nipponbare; fifty-eight plants were obtained. the one hundred and twenty-eight plants that were obtained using these techniques were self-crossed to produce  <dig> cssls.

constructing the physical map of the cssls
on the basis of the physical locations and genotypes of the  <dig> molecular markers in the  <dig> cssls, the lengths and locations of the substituted chromosome segments were estimated. using the results of the estimation, a physical map of the  <dig> cssls was constructed .

when a 36-mer read of a cssl was aligned to a region where a snp was detected between the two parents, the genotype of the cssl was assigned to this nucleotide position. using the quality score of each snp base as a filter, a total of  <dig>  million high quality snps were detected. therefore, every cssl had approximately  <dig>  snps . every snp originated from nipponbare or  <dig>  the average snp density of the cssls was  <dig>  snps/kb, or one snp every  <dig>  kb. on the basis of the physical locations and genotypes of these snps, each cssl was genotyped, and a physical map of the  <dig> cssls was constructed .

number, length and distribution of substituted chromosome segments in cssls
from the physical map constructed with molecular markers, the  <dig> cssls carried  <dig> substituted chromosome segments and each cssl contained between one and three substituted segments from the donor in the genetic background of  <dig>  of these,  <dig> cssls carried one substituted segment,  <dig> carried two, and one carried three substituted segments . the length of substituted chromosome segments in the  <dig> cssls ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, with an average of  <dig>  mb. seventy-six segments were shorter than  <dig>  mb and  <dig> were longer than  <dig>  mb . the distribution of the segments along the chromosomes was not random. different introgressed frequencies existed among the  <dig> chromosomes: of the  <dig> substituted segments,  <dig> existed on chromosome  <dig>  while there were only six on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

to conduct qtl analyses, the sequencing-based physical map was converted into a skeleton bin map. a total of  <dig> bins  were obtained for the  <dig> cssls. the average physical length of the recombination bins was  <dig>  bp . this bin map was used for mapping qtls that control cl.

qtl analysis of the  <dig> cssls mapped nine qtls: qcl1- <dig>  qcl1- <dig>  qcl1- <dig>  qcl1- <dig>  qcl3- <dig>  qcl3- <dig>  qcl5- <dig>  qcl6- <dig> and qcl8- <dig>  which were located in x <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  x <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  x <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  x <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  x <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  x <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  x <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  x <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and x <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  respectively. these qtls explained  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance of cl, respectively . the qtl with the largest effect was mapped to x <dig> and occupied the physical position of  <dig> , <dig> bp to  <dig> , <dig> bp, which comprises a  <dig> -bp region on chromosome  <dig> that contains the semi-dwarf gene sd <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
high-throughput genotyping of cssls is time- and cost-effective, resulting in highly reliable information regarding substituted segments
molecular markers have been used successfully in genotyping assays for developing mapping populations and map-based cloning of genes in rice  <cit> . in this study, cssls were developed via mas and genotyped using  <dig> markers. the process of collecting, designing, screening and amplifing using pcr, and scoring on agarose gels, took more than three years. subsequently, the cssls were genotyped using high-throughput sequencing, and an ultrahigh-quality physical map based on whole-genome re-sequencing was constructed. this is the first study to use this method for genotyping cssls in rice, and remarkably, the entire process took only seven weeks. the sequencing-based high-throughput method is significantly more time-efficient and cost-effective and less laborious than the conventional pcr-based genotyping approach.

of most importance, the sequencing-based high-throughput method provides more information that is more accurate than the conventional approach. in this study, an average coverage of  <dig>  kb per snp was obtained, or  <dig> mb per  <dig> snps for the cssls, a considerably better resolution than the  <dig>  mb per marker obtained with pcr-based markers. therefore, the new method improved the resolution of recombination breakpoints 236-fold, and almost eliminated the likelihood of missing double-crossovers in the mapping population. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  two double-crossovers in cssl  <dig> were detected by the sequencing-based method that had not been identified by the pcr-based method owing to limited marker density. ebitani et al. constructed and genotyped cssls derived from a cross of 'kasalath' and 'koshihikari' using  <dig> rflp markers  <cit> ;  <dig> ssr and  <dig> est markers were used by takai et al.  <cit> , and zhu et al. used  <dig> ssr markers in their study  <cit> . hence, the  <dig> markers used here represented a higher density than those used in the aforementioned reports. nevertheless, employing the new sequencing-based approach,  <dig> segments, each shorter than  <dig> mb, were identified that had not been revealed by the conventional pcr-based approach. the final analysis demonstrated that cssls derived from advanced backcross and self-cross lines contained a large number of double-crossovers rather than molecular markers. the sequencing-based method is perhaps one of the most suitable approaches to genotyping mapping populaions that provide an accurate foundation for qtl mapping.

cssls derived from two sequenced cultivars can simplify map-based cloning of qtls
the two subspecies of rice in asia, indica and japonica, differ greatly in terms of their agronomic traits and have a strong potential for heterosis. a number of mapping populations derived from crosses between indica and japonica rice have been constructed for use in in-depth analyses of the genetic variations between the two subspecies  <cit> . the construction and utilization of the cssls derived from  <dig> and nipponbare, which are the typical varieties of indica and japonica that have undergone whole-genome sequencing previously, are highly consequential. first, the genomic sequencing information that has been generated has facilitated the search for high-density molecular markers for the fine mapping of qtls for target traits. second, once the location of a target qtl has been targeted to a certain region that contains a number of predicted genes, sequence analysis using the existed sequence information can narrow the search for candidate genes and allow them to be detected efficiently and quickly. therefore, the use of this cssl population, combined with the application of modern bio-informatics, can simplify the process of map-based cloning of qtls of interest.

the cssls constructed a platform for qtl mapping
cssls can be used for detecting and fine mapping of qtls as a single mendelian factor by blocking background genetic noise, which simplifies the process of data analysis and increases the accuracy of the results. to date, several sets of cssls have been developed and used for the mapping of qtls  <cit> . however, the cssls described in the present study were developed via mas and genotyped using limited markers, for which no accurate detection previously existed. this resulted in some double-crossovers being undetected, which was confirmed in the present study. therefore, some qtls may not have been detected, and others were mapped to the wrong region. in this study, we developed  <dig> cssls in the genetic background of rice cultivar  <dig>  using these lines, combined with the sequencing-based bin-map, nine qtls were mapped which explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for cl in these specific intervals on rice chromosomes. more importantly, a qtl with a large effect was found to be located in a  <dig> -bp region that contained the rice ''green revolution'' gene. we believe that this level of detection would not be possible using other populations.

the cssls constructed a platform for rice breeding
plant breeding combines art and science to improve the genetic basis of new varieties of crops with increased productivity and quality  <cit> . traditional breeding was predominantly based on phenotypic assays. plant breeding systems have entered a molecular breeding era, where the process of molecular marker-assisted selection is used in plant breeding programs to combine phenotype and genotype. this approach shortens the breeding period and improves efficiency, and overcomes the traditional shortcoming of low accuracy with broad applications. however, thus far the method targets the qtls of only one or a very few traits for genetic improvement. cssls selected at the level of the whole genome and multi-trait breeding objectives in areas such as the expansion of multiple targets have been pivotal in improving the properties of plants while leading the way in the ongoing technological innovation of plant breeding.

the elite indica cultivar  <dig>  used as the recipient in this study, has been planted on a large scale as an excellent variety, and has been widely used as a parent of super hybrid rice in china with a good grain shape, high eating quality, high yield and multi-resistance to disease. some elite cssls in this wide population have a similar genetic background to  <dig>  but their comprehensive characteristics were better than  <dig> in different environmental conditions . therefore, they could be used to create new varieties with direct marketing applications, and as a parent to create new hybrids. furthermore, there are favorable alleles at the loci of interest that can be combined through mas and lead to the production of superior rice varieties.

CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully developed a wide population that contains  <dig> cssls, which were used to construct a platform for qtl mapping, cloning and marker-assisted breeding in rice. each line was genotyped and a high-quality physical map of ultrahigh-density snps based on whole-genome re-sequencing data was constructed. information related to substituted segments and the background of each line was considerably more accurate in this map than in a comparison map constructed using  <dig> pcr-based markers. the cssls described in this study are powerful tools for large-scale gene discovery and could have a significant impact on the future of the functional genomics of rice.
