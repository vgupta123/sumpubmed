BACKGROUND
soybean  is considered one of the most important leguminous crops worldwide because of its use as human food, and in oil production. in brazil, soybean became economically important in the 1970s, and since then, its significance in the world agricultural market has increased. globally, brazil is the second largest soybean producer, with  <dig>  million tons harvested from  <dig>  million hectares of cultivated area during the 2013- <dig> growing season  <cit> . this clearly demonstrates the importance of this crop to brazilian agribusiness and the strategic role of breeding programs focused on higher yield, stress tolerance, and crop quality.

however, soybean breeding in brazil has a very recent history, with the first cultivar  developed in the 1940s. the success of soybean in brazilian agribusiness is due to the direct results of increased production in traditional areas and the advancement of new agricultural frontiers, mainly in the savannah region, associated with the availability of germplasm adapted to tropical regions  <cit> . although soybean breeding programs in brazil have led to progress and achievements, some factors continue to limit the crop production potential, including diseases and unfavorable environmental conditions. indeed, the restricted nature of the brazilian soybean germplasm increases the risk of new pathogenic pest variants or emerging diseases. in previous studies, hiromoto and vello  <cit>  described  <dig> soybean ancestors with significant contributions to the brazilian soybean germplasm. pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , pi  <dig> , and pi  <dig>  are the most important ancestors, and a recent study showed that these four ancestors contributed to  <dig>  % of the brazilian soybean germplasm  <cit> . moreover, the same study revealed six important ancestors of brazilian soybeans that are shared with the u.s. soybean germplasm , as the first brazilian cultivars were developed based on the u.s. germplasm.

therefore, the development of tools that support breeding programs to maintain the demand for cultivars with higher yields and that are adapted to different stress conditions is essential to meet the demand to feed a growing worldwide population. techniques in genomics and molecular biology have emerged as important tools for advancing plant breeding with the goal of crop improvement, and new high-throughput sequencing platforms have arisen as alternative methods for trait discovery, allelic variation, and population studies as well and genome-wide association analysis  in plants  <cit> .

in soybeans, large-scale sequencing efforts have recently been realized with the first reference genome sequencing  <cit>  of a 978-megabase  assembly of the williams  <dig> cultivar, which allowed the identification of  <dig>  genes distributed throughout  <dig> chromosomes. the same study showed that approximately 75 % of the genes in the soybean genome are present in multiple copies.

the wild soybean glycine soja has also been studied at the genome level. kim et al.  <cit>  sequenced  <dig>  mb of a wild soybean accession and found  <dig>  megabases of substituted sequences,  <dig> kilobases  of indels,  <dig>  megabases of deletions and  <dig>  megabases of new sequences when compared with the glycine max reference genome cv. williams  <dig> 

amidst the large amount of information generated by genome-wide sequencing, resequencing strategies have become important tools for studies of allelic variation. in other plant species, whole-genome resequencing has been widely used in various genomic studies, including arabidopsis  <cit> , corn  <cit> , rice  <cit> , cucumber  <cit>  and sorghum  <cit> . in soybean, several resequencing efforts have also been reported recently. for example, by resequencing  <dig> wild and commercial soybean cultivars, lam et al.  <cit>  identified a high level of diversity in wild soybean accessions, which allowed the identification of  <dig>  snps. chung et al.  <cit>  catalogued the genomic variation in commercial and wild soybean accessions from korea and identified  <dig>  million high-quality snps. in another study, li et al.  <cit>  analyzed the genome of  <dig> resequenced chinese soybean accessions along with  <dig> soybean accessions identified in a public database and identified  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  indels, of which  <dig>  % had not been previously reported. recently,  <dig> resequenced genomes of wild, landrace, and improved accessions of soybean were analyzed, and a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  indels were detected  <cit> .

the large amount of sequence information continuously deposited in public databases demonstrates the value of such studies for a better understanding of the genetic basis of this leguminous crop. furthermore, the advent of cost effective and new high-throughput sequencing technologies for genome-wide analysis have allowed deeper genome sequencing of a large number of lines of various crops. thus, resequencing strategies are important tools for identifying variations that can be utilized in breeding programs for crops with limited genetic variation, such as soybean. the overall lack of available information increases the need for in-depth studies about the genomic diversity of the brazilian germplasm. moreover, resequencing analyses represent a powerful approach for identifying a large number of allelic/structural variations that can be useful for detecting important genes in breeding programs and for protecting soybean seed stock via cultivar fingerprinting.

in the present study, we resequenced  <dig> brazilian soybean lines released over the last 50 years that are adapted to different regions in brazil. these sequences were used to evaluate variations among the genomes throughout the history of brazilian soybean breeding programs. furthermore, we identified genomic regions associated with important variations, such as deletions, substitutions and duplications, which could be helpful for explaining divergence/similarity among different cultivars.

RESULTS
sequencing and variation
a total of  <dig> brazilian soybean accessions were re-sequenced , resulting in the generation of approximately  <dig>  billion paired-end reads with a read length of 100 bp and an average genome coverage of  <dig> x. the percentage of reads mapped to the soybean genome for each accession was  <dig>  %, which demonstrated that the resequencing effort covered most of the genome . when mapped against the reference genome,  <dig> , <dig> snps were identified in the brazilian lines, representing a higher value than previously reported  <cit> . however, it was expected due to the high coverage depth in the present study compared with previous investigations. these snps are well distributed across all chromosomes, with chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrating the largest number of snps  and the highest ratio of snps per chromosome length . as expected, most of the snps/indels are homozygous. nonetheless,  <dig>  % of them are heterozygous, and the embrapa  <dig> cultivar possesses the greatest number of heterozygous snps . when compared with the reference genome, most of the nucleotide changes can be classified as transitions, with a transition/transversion ratio  of  <dig>  . a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps were detected in intergenic regions. in coding regions, we found a total of  <dig>  snps in exons,  <dig>  snps in introns and  <dig>  snps in utrs . the non-synonymous-to-synonymous ratio observed between the brazilian accessions was  <dig> . although the ratio observed in this study was lower than those observed in other soybean studies  <cit> , it is higher than that reported for other plants, such as sorghum  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . the genomes of cvs. santa rosa and doko have the highest number of snps, whereas cvs. brs  <dig> and brs/go  <dig> have the lowest numbers .fig.  <dig> summary of the major modifications caused by snps and indels. a snps  and indels  distributed among the  <dig> soybean chromosomes. b numbers of transition/transversion mutations: pyrimidine/purine , purine/pyrimidine , pyrimidine/pyrimidine  and purine/purine . c percentage of snps per region in the soybean genome. d percentage of indels per region in the soybean genome

a total of  <dig> , <dig> indels were detected among the brazilian soybean accessions, lower than the proportion observed in other species  <cit> . for indels, the distribution along chromosomes and the homozygous/heterozygous proportion for each cultivar were similar to what was observed for snps . approximately  <dig>  of the indels are in intergenic regions;  <dig>  are in intronic regions,  <dig>  in utr regions and  <dig>  in exons. similar to the snp analysis, doko and santa rosa demonstrated the greatest number of indels and brs  <dig> and brs/go  <dig> the lowest number. a summary of these variations is shown in fig. 1d.

allelic variations in the brazilian germplasm
the allelic variations found in the brazilian germplasm have led to a large number of codon modifications in important genomic regions, and a large number of genes with allelic variations in brazilian lines were revealed upon comparison with the soybean reference genome.

in all of the brazilian lines,  <dig>  loci share the same allelic variation that is divergent from the reference genome, of which  <dig>  are snps and  <dig>  are indels. in addition to this information,  <dig>  allelic variations, including  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels, are shared among all of the brazilian lines and are present in  <dig> u.s. accessions . one of the u.s. soybean accessions is of the cv. williams  <dig> background, thereby increasing the chances of detecting the presence of sequencing errors in the reference genome or allelic variations exclusive to cv. williams  <dig> 

a total of  <dig> snps shared among all of the brazilian cultivars were identified in important regions of  <dig> genes . according to soybase enrichment analysis  <cit> ,  <dig> genes are associated with the generation of metabolite precursors and energy related to dna-dependent transcription/elongation and processes related to photosynthesis. some of these processes can also be related to cell respiration and atp synthesis-coupled electron transport .

a similar analysis of non-synonymous mutations in important gene regions was conducted to identify indels exclusive to the brazilian cultivars . a total of  <dig> indels are non-synonymous modifications detected in  <dig> genes, most of which are in exons; an exception is one haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase gene  that contains a frameshift modification associated with the loss of a stop codon.

in addition, we found seven genes with putative modifications due to the presence of snps resulting in the loss of a start codon shared among all of the brazilian lines. these genes are related to protein binding , atp synthesis-coupled electron transport and nadh dehydrogenase  activity  and include three putative pseudogenes on chromosome  <dig> : glyma.16 g <dig> , glyma.16 g <dig>  and glyma.16 g <dig> . we identified six snps in stop codons, but only two of the genes have been annotated: glyma.07 g <dig> has an ap <dig> domain related to transcriptional regulation, and glyma.18 g <dig> is associated with atp binding because it is a cell component of chloroplasts.

moreover, we detected four snps that lead to alternative splicing, including a gene with a ppr repeat domain , which could be related to plant disease resistance mechanisms, nadh-ubiquinone/plastoquinone , and dna replication protein . no annotation was found for glyma.17 g <dig> 

finally, we identified putative exon losses in the brazilian cultivars due to the presence of indels in three genes. brs sambaiba has an indel that is responsible for the loss of the second exon of glyma.09g <dig>  a sodium/calcium exchanger protein. a similar loss was observed in the first exon of  <dig> -beta-glucan synthase  in cvs. br  <dig> and embrapa  <dig>  in addition, the first exon of glyma.18g <dig> is absent in cvs. brsmt uirapuru, cd  <dig>  emgopa  <dig>  ft abyara and ft cristalina. compared with the reference genome, a heterozygous indel is present in cvs. brsmt uirapuru, ft abyara and ft cristalina.

several gene modifications were found in the brazilian accessions compared with the reference genome. once confirmed, these differences could provide insight into plant adaptation to the tropical conditions in brazil as well as the loss of function of genes that may not have a key role in survival. however, more detailed studies are needed to verify the functions of these modified genes, especially those related to photosynthesis and the generation of metabolites, precursor metabolites and energy processes.

influence of allelic variation in determinate/indeterminate growth habits and maturity group distribution
a total of  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were detected in the e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> loci. most of the allelic variation was observed in the non-coding gene region, including  <dig> allelic modifications 5 kb upstream of the loci;  <dig> allelic modifications were detected in coding regions, mostly in introns. furthermore, three non-synonymous modifications in exons and one in a splice site region were found. we observed new allelic variations in these loci, as well as variations similar to those already described . according to a previous study, cv. williams  <dig> has the genotype “e1-as, e <dig>  e <dig>  e4”  <cit> . among the brazilian cultivars, brs/go chapadões, brsmg 850g rr, conquista, brs valiosa rr, vmax rr, and na  <dig> rg exhibit a dominant genotype for all loci according to allelic comparisons with williams  <dig>  in contrast, based on an allelic variation comparison with williams  <dig>  brs  <dig> is the only accession with a recessive genotype, excluding the e <dig> locus.

our results clustered some cultivars according to their relative maturity group  , and all of the southern determinate soybeans clustered together; similar clustering was observed for most of the northern soybeans. however, some accessions with a high rmg that clustered closely to those with a low rmg. this result suggested that other e locus have had an important impact on the adaptability of cultivars in brazil.fig.  <dig> twenty-four snps identified in e1-e <dig> loci, and the regulatory region of the e <dig> gene. upstream: snps were detected up to 5 kb upstream of the coding region; non-synonymous: snp variants causing a codon that produces a different amino acid; intron: snps detected inside an intron; 3’ utr: snps found in the 3’utr; 5’utr: snps was found in the 5’ utr; splice site region: sequence variants in which a change has occurred within the region of the splice site, either within 1- <dig> bases of the exon or 3- <dig> bases of the intron



cultivars brs  <dig> and brs  <dig>  both indeterminate soybeans with great adaptability, possess allele e <dig>  as observed in williams  <dig> for the e <dig> locus, and a similar haplotype. for the e <dig> locus,  <dig> cultivars showed alleles different from those in the reference genome, including all of the determinate soybeans from south brazil. williams  <dig> has the dominant e <dig> allele, indicating that the  <dig> cultivars harbor allelic variations that might influence the function of this locus. at the e <dig> locus, we observed a recessive allele in four cultivars released before  <dig> and in five cultivars released after  <dig>  including four with semi-determinate/indeterminate growth.

none of the brazilian cultivars carry allelic variations in the coding region of the e <dig> locus, showing the same genotype as that of williams  <dig>  however, a  <dig>  -  <dig>  kb interval upstream of the locus region contains  <dig> allelic variations that are shared among all of the brazilian cultivars but differ from williams  <dig>  this finding suggests that a regulatory region may influence the e <dig> locus in brazilian cultivars. according to a previous study, modifications in the e <dig> locus play a key role in adaptations to high-latitude environments  <cit> , and the e <dig> and e <dig> loci have a role in pre- and post-flowering development in soybeans  <cit> . thus, our results indicate that modifications in the regulatory e <dig> locus may have served crucial functions in the adaptation of all cultivars in brazil.

we identified non-synonymous modifications in e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> exons, with the e <dig> modification identified only in cv. doko. moreover, one snp was identified close to a splice site of the e <dig>  for e <dig>  we only detected modifications in an interval between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp upstream of the locus, which might represent modifications in a regulatory region.

a similar analysis was performed for the plant growth habit dt1: a total of  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were identified in this locus. as in the case of e loci, the number of allelic variations in non-coding regions was higher compared to coding regions; in fact, only one non-synonymous snp was found in an exon in the present analysis. importantly, the allelic variation identified in this study was able to distinguish all of the cultivars according to their growth habit . williams  <dig> has an indeterminate grown habit, indicating the presence of a dominant allele for the dt <dig> locus  <cit> . according to our sequencing data, anta  <dig>  brs  <dig>  brs  <dig> rr, brs  <dig>  brs/go  <dig>  na  <dig> rg, and vmax rr have allelic variations that are similar to williams  <dig>  suggesting that they also carry the dominant allele dt <dig> 

dt <dig> locus analysis clearly grouped all of the accessions with determinate growth, with a non-synonymous snp identified in this locus in nearly all of the cultivars with determinate growth, excluding cv. doko. as this finding has been reported in other studies, this snp appears to be important for the function of dt <dig>  which indicates that the growth characteristics associated with this allele, might be affected in cv. doko. because cv. anta  <dig> is semi-determinate, a depth analysis of the dt <dig> locus is necessary to confirm our findings because the two loci  with epistatic interactions control semi-determinate plants. soybeans with the genotype “dt <dig>  dt2” are indeterminate plants, in contrast to semi-determinate plants of the “dt <dig>  dt2” genotype  <cit> , which suggests that the allelic variation in dt <dig> is able to clearly cluster cultivars according to their genotype.

finally, anta  <dig>  brs  <dig>  and brs  <dig> carry allelic modifications in the e <dig> and dt <dig> as well as in a regulatory region of the e <dig>  according to a previous study, e <dig> and e <dig> have a meaningful effect on the up-regulation of dt <dig> expression in plants  <cit> , and our findings might help in understanding the great adaptability capacity of these cultivars to different rmg.

low divergence in the brazilian soybean germplasm
brazilian soybean germplasm has a very narrow genetic diversity due to a very recent breeding program history and the presence of a small number of ancestors that are mainly derived from u.s. soybean germplasm. to study the population structure of the brazilian soybean germplasm, we constructed a neighbor-joining  tree based on sequencing data for the brazilian soybean cultivars  in which the accessions were grouped according to their genealogy.fig.  <dig> population structure analysis of  <dig> brazilian soybean cultivars. a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree generated for the  <dig> brazilian soybean accessions. b principal component analysis  from the  <dig> brazilian soybean cultivars, c bayesian clustering  for the  <dig> brazilian soybean cultivars



moreover, the seven cultivars harboring dominant alleles for the dt <dig> locus clustered closely together. this finding suggests an influence of the stem growth habit on the clustering of brazilian cultivars and confirms our results of dt <dig> locus allelic variation. in addition, some soybean cyst nematode-resistant cultivars clustered closely together. brsmt pintado, p98y <dig>  and brs/chapadões display the peking-type resistance and anta  <dig> and vmax rr the pi088788-type resistance. brs  <dig> rr is a susceptible cultivar that carries a peking-type rhg <dig> but no rhg <dig> locus in its genome, suggesting the presence and influence of the rhg <dig> locus in this germplasm clustering.

the principal component analysis  and the genetic structure of the collection of brazilian soybean lines used were examined in this study. the pca provided similar results from the nj tree, with the brazilian accessions clearly separated into three groups . furthermore, the results obtained in pca highlighted that santa rosa and brs sambaiba are in the same cluster, as we observed in nj tree, but they are not so much close due some genetic divergence among the cultivars.

the k value was established as ranging between  <dig> to  <dig>  and the best model components used to explain the structure for these data was model k =  <dig>  the structure bar plot showed similar results observed in the nj tree and pca, with most of the accessions clustered according to their background . moreover, some evidence for admixture was observed for br  <dig>  brs  <dig>  brs  <dig>  brs/go  <dig>  brs/go chapadões, doko, emgopa  <dig>  ft abyara and santa rosa. the results suggest that the brazilian soybean germplasm is still very homogeneous, with potential introgression in a few cultivars. evaluating  <dig> cultivars and  <dig> ssr markers, priolli et al  <cit>  was able to cluster brazilian soybeans into two groups . the discrepancy in k between the present and previous studies is mainly due to the number of cultivars and markers used in our study. a small number of accessions associated with a large number of snps has been used in other studies to clearly separate some cultivars and wild soybeans  <cit> .

breeding programs always focus on the development of cultivars with the best performance under the influence of various environmental and field conditions. thus, the development of cultivars tends to select and consequently modify certain genes/qtls over time by increasing/removing important alleles in the selected germplasm. accordingly, the identification of regions with high diversity as well as those with a low level of modification is extremely important for improving soybean adaptation to various environmental conditions in breeding programs.

to identify genomic regions with high levels of diversity between old and more recent cultivars, we calculated the fixation index  among the brazilian accessions. regions with high fst values could be related to artificial selection events, and regions with low fst values could indicate the existence of little genetic differentiation between accessions.

we identified  <dig> 10-kb regions with fst values higher than  <dig>  distributed in most of the soybean chromosomes. chromosome  <dig> has the highest number of sub-regions with high fst values. two chromosomes,  <dig> and  <dig>  present no sub-regions with high fst values, which may be because these chromosomes do not have a strong influence on artificial selection during the development of new cultivars.

in contrast, we detected  <dig>  sub-regions with fst values lower than  <dig> , which revealed a large number of genomic regions with low diversity between the latest and oldest cultivars. chromosome  <dig> contains the greatest number of these sub-regions with low diversity, with chromosome  <dig> having the smallest number. lam et al  <cit>  identified  <dig> sub-regions with high fst values and  <dig> sub-regions with low fst values in a comparison between wild and commercial soybeans, and the proportion of high/low fst values detected was higher compared with our results. this finding can be explained by more divergent data because two different species, glycine soja and glycine max, were compared in that previous study; conversely, only commercial g. max accessions from the same geographic region were used in our study. a large number of sub-regions with a low level of diversity demonstrate that the brazilian soybean germplasm has remained narrow. these observations are consistent with the results of previous studies in which  <dig> brazilian soybean lines displayed the same pattern  <cit> , whereby a cumulative relative genetic contribution of  <dig>  % was attributed to only four main ancestors, with an increase in the number of ancestors in the germplasm over time.

regions affected by positive selection processes in the brazilian germplasm
forty-one sub-regions with high fst values associated with a low level of nucleotide diversity  were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the new cultivars compared with the old cultivars . this number is lower than that reported by zhou et al.  <cit> , who identified  <dig> 100-kb regions using a selective sweep. the main reason for this discrepancy is the large number of accessions used in that study compared with our study. furthermore, the previous analysis was conducted with wild, landrace and improved soybeans, whereas only brazilian cultivars were examined in our study.table  <dig> number of unique snps, indels and cnvs for each brazilian soybean cultivar

we identified  <dig> sub-regions with a size of 10 kb within two intervals on chromosome 17; four sub-regions within the  <dig> - <dig>  mb interval with  <dig> snps and  <dig> sub-regions between the  <dig> - <dig>  mb interval with  <dig>  snps . most of the snps identified in both intervals were able to differentiate doko, iac  <dig>  ias  <dig> and paraná from the other cultivars. these intervals have been previously described in other studies due to the presence of a large number of qtls, such as those related to seed size , seed genistein/palmitic acid content  <cit> , plant/root weight, phosphorus content  <cit> , canopy wilting  <cit> , and resistance to soybean cyst nematodes  <cit>  and white mold  <cit> .fig.  <dig> two regions between  <dig> - <dig>  mb  and  <dig> - <dig>  mb  on chromosome  <dig> under positive selection. the red line corresponds to the nucleotide diversity of the newest cultivars and the blue line the oldest cultivars. the black line is the fst values between the oldest and newest cultivars



furthermore, we identified additional sub-regions with high fst values on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  six sub-regions located at the end of chromosome  <dig> were detected, and all of these sub-regions carry snps that reveal a difference between cultivars iac  <dig>  santa rosa, and doko compared with the other cultivars. tajuddin et al  <cit>  described two qtls for seed oil content within these sub-regions. in the present study, we identified four genes between  <dig> - <dig>  mb on chromosome 7: glyma.07g <dig> , glyma.07g <dig> , glyma.07g <dig>  and glyma.07g <dig> . however, three other sub-regions detected on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig>  are located at the beginning of these chromosomes. only on chromosome  <dig> did we identify a modified gene due to the presence of an snp: glyma.18g <dig>  an amino acid transporter. however, several studies have reported the presence of qtls that control important traits in these sub-regions. indeed, several qtls responsible for seed volume/length  <cit> , isoflavone content  <cit> , oleic/linoleic acid content  <cit>  and protein/oil content  <cit>  have been identified on chromosome  <dig>  and most of the identified qtls on chromosome  <dig> are related to soybean cyst nematode resistance  and protein content  <cit> . the snps on chromosome  <dig> found in this study differentiated iac  <dig>  paraná, and doko from the new cultivars; however, we identified a similar pattern in cv. embrapa  <dig> compared with the oldest cultivars, which could be explained by the presence of paraná in its pedigree. furthermore, the snps on chromosome  <dig> identified in the present study differentiated ias  <dig>  paraná, and doko from the most recent cultivars.

the high fst values associated with high θπ values in the oldest compared with the most recent cultivars confirmed the presence of sub-regions under positive selection processes. thus, the brazilian accessions experienced meaningful modifications in these  <dig> sub-regions over time. the presence of important traits within these sub-regions associated with a large difference in brazilian soybean production over time and high fst values reinforce the notion of the existence of sub-regions that were influenced by positive selection.

we also identified a large number of regions with fst values less than  <dig> . this result suggested the presence of regions with low diversity, indicating the presence of balancing selection. a portion of these regions under balancing selection could have important genes/qtls that are responsible for survival. this finding, together with the detection of a large number of regions with high fst values, could be an important target for breeding programs to maintain these regions under positive selection. moreover, the identification of regions under balancing selection that are not related to essential plant processes could be another important target for the insertion new alleles that could improve major traits in brazilian cultivars.

copy number variations could explain the observed divergence among cultivars
cnvs refer to structural modifications that result in changes in copy number in a specific region of the genome. such modifications may vary in size, and recently some studies have demonstrated their broad importance because they are linked to several traits, including some diseases in humans such as alzheimer’s disease  <cit> , autism  <cit>  and parkinson’s disease  <cit> . in soybean, a significant number of cnvs are associated with important traits, such as resistance to cyst nematode  <cit>  and hilum color  <cit> . moreover, a total of  <dig> cnvs have been identified as being potentially selected during soybean domestication and improvement processes  <cit> . as the identification of these cnvs in the soybean genome is extremely important, we analyzed all of the brazilian soybean lines to identify important cnvs related to the divergence that has accumulated during the time between the oldest and the most recent accessions.

a total of  <dig>  sub-regions containing cnvs across  <dig> chromosomes were detected in the brazilian lines. the greatest number of cnv regions was identified on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and the lowest number was found on chromosome  <dig>  a summary of the number of cnvs detected for the cultivars is shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig> 

when comparing the oldest to the most recent cultivars, chromosome  <dig> shows cnvs in  <dig> sub-regions . more than 80 % of the most recent cultivars do not have these deletions, which were only present in the oldest cultivars, doko, emgopa  <dig>  ft abyara, ias  <dig>  paraná, and santa rosa. one of these regions, ranging from  <dig> - <dig>  mb, was not found in any cultivar developed after  <dig>  furthermore, this cnv is not present in more than 70 % of the accessions prior to  <dig>  these results suggest that the  <dig> sub-regions identified on chromosome  <dig>  especially the one described most recently, were acquired more recently in the breeding process. other studies have described qtls associated with flowering and maturity  <cit> , pod number and quality  <cit> , and leaflet format  <cit>  in these intervals, increasing the possibility of the influence of cnvs on modifications over time.fig.  <dig> copy number variations detected on chromosome  <dig> for the oldest and newest brazilian cultivars. the x-axis represents the genomic position and y-axis the log-ratio of the read counts. the red dots are the copy number call of each segment



other important cnv regions that distinguished the oldest soybean lines from the most recent ones were detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . five meaningful deleted regions shared among more than 70 % of the most recent cultivars were detected on chromosome  <dig> between  <dig> - <dig>  mb. cultivars iac  <dig>  ias  <dig>  paraná, santa rosa, doko, and ft-abyara show common insertions for four cnv regions, and six additional accessions carry these insertions: br- <dig>  mg/br <dig>  brs  <dig>  brs sambaíba, brs valiosa rr and brmg 850g rr. these lines share a common ancestry with the oldest accession examined herein, which could explain the presence of the regions in these accessions. these patterns could indicate the presence of a duplicated region in the oldest cultivars and a deletion in the most recent cultivars.

furthermore, relevant results were obtained for chromosome  <dig>  five sub-regions between  <dig> - <dig>  mb exhibit deletions only present in the oldest cultivars, doko, ias  <dig>  and paraná, and in the four most recent cultivars, brs  <dig>  brs/go  <dig>  brs/go chapadões and vmax rr. moreover, a deletion identified between  <dig> - <dig>  mb was detected only in cvs. doko, santa rosa, and iac  <dig>  all of the accessions produced during the 1981- <dig> period lack this last cnv, potentially suggesting that this sub-region has been introgressed into the brazilian soybean germplasm by  <dig>  some studies have suggested the presence of qtls related to yield  <cit> , plant height  <cit> , and oleic acid content  <cit>  in this interval, and such introgressions could be important for soybean adaptability and productivity in brazil.

we also identified important deletions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the oldest accessions and in a few recent lines. three deletions on chromosome  <dig> were found in doko, iac  <dig>  paraná, and conquista and three in the most recent lines, anta  <dig>  brs valiosa rr and brsmg 850g rr. cultivar cd  <dig> displays an insertion in the same region. thus, more than 78 % of the brazilian accessions produced after the 1970s demonstrate introgression of these three regions in their genomes over time. chromosome  <dig> shows a deletion of 8 kb in cd  <dig>  ias  <dig>  paraná, santa rosa but in less than 30 % of the most recent cultivars, and only four recent lines  exhibit the same pattern as the oldest cultivars. thus, it is possible that these sub-regions were introgressed in the majority of the most recent accessions, excluding the cnvs we identified. finally, chromosome  <dig> exhibits deletions in the oldest cultivars, doko, iac  <dig>  iac  <dig>  and paraná. this finding could indicate the presence of introgression in soybeans produced after the 1970s, and the presence of a qtl in another study associated with productivity  <cit>  revealed the importance of this cnv.

overall, the cnv analysis demonstrated that it is an important tool for verifying meaningful modifications in genomes. indeed, the detection of this modified region will greatly impact future genomic studies in soybean regarding such aspects as the importance of gains/losses of these regions in qtl and genes.

application of unique allelic and structural variations to cultivar fingerprinting
we identified exclusive allelic and structural variations for each of the lines used in our study. a total of  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  indels and  <dig>  cnvs exclusive to each cultivar were detected .

the results showing some cultivars with a large number  of exclusive variations yet others with very few  can be explained by the small number of cultivars used in this study. as expected, brs valiosa rr and conquista showed very little exclusive variation because they are very closely related; brs valiosa was derived by backcrossing from conquista. brsmg 850g was also found to be very closely related to these two cultivars, which explained the minimal variation among them. the high similarity among these cultivars could explain the difficultly associated with identifying exclusive structural and allelic variations in the genome. in contrast, santa rosa, the oldest cultivar used in this study, brs  <dig>  doko and iac  <dig> have the greatest allelic variation and a large number of structural variations. because doko, iac <dig> and santa rosa are very old cultivars developed in the 1960s and 1970s, the large number of exclusive variations in their genomes could indicate they did not have a large influence on the more recent cultivars.

these findings could be very useful in breeding programs utilizing marker-assisted selection  and cultivar fingerprinting for cultivar protection. nonetheless, a validation process will be necessary to confirm the presence of these exclusive alleles in brazilian cultivars and should be a priority in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first genomic analysis of the allelic and structural variations present in brazilian soybean cultivars. our results confirmed the hypothesis that the brazilian soybean germplasm remains narrow. however, it was possible to detect the presence of snps and cnvs that distinguished the examined cultivars. the resequencing data allowed the detection of allelic variations that can be applied for identifying genes useful to breeding programs in the future.

based on our comparison of brazilian cultivars, we confirmed a large number of allelic modifications in genes associated with the generation of precursor metabolites and energy related to dna-dependent transcription/elongation and photosynthesis. such modifications may be related to important functions in the adaptation of soybean to the tropical conditions of brazil. furthermore, the presence of a large amount of cnv regions that permit differentiation among the brazilian germplasm also appears to be a potential target for studies of important agronomic traits. therefore, further analysis of these cnv regions should be treated as a top priority in the future.

the sub-regions with low diversification identified in brazilian soybean cultivars may not have been utilized in breeding programs to date. however, these sub-regions may represent targets for the incorporation of new agronomically relevant alleles. in addition, measures to increase the diversity of the brazilian soybean germplasm should be considered; for example, the use of genotypes from different geographical regions, such as asian germplasm, or the selection of parental genotypes more divergent for specific genomic regions.

finally, our resequencing analyses of brazilian soybean cultivars were able to reveal a large number of exclusive snps. these results may constitute an important breeding tool for cultivar fingerprinting and soybean seed protection. however, a validation process will be necessary to confirm our results.
