BACKGROUND
lactococcus garvieae is one of the most important bacterial pathogens that affect different farmed fish species in many countries, although its major impact is on the trout farm industry  <cit> . in addition to farmed fish, this microorganism has also been isolated from a wide range of wild fish species, from both fresh and marine water, as well as from giant fresh water prawns  <cit>  and from wild marine mammals  <cit> . the host range of l. garvieae is not limited to aquatic species. this agent has also been identified in cows and water buffalos with subclinical mastitis  <cit>  and from cat and dog tonsils  <cit> . in humans it has been isolated from the urinary tract, blood, and skin and from patients with pneumonia, endocarditis or septicaemia  <cit> . recently, intestinal disorders in humans have been associated with the consumption of raw fish contaminated with this pathogen  <cit> , which suggests that l. garvieae could be considered as a potentially zoonotic bacterium  <cit> . despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of l. garvieae in both veterinary and human medicine, there is almost a complete lack of knowledge about the genetic content of this microorganism.

in the last few years, research in microbial genetics has changed fundamentally, from an approach involving the characterization of individual genes to a global analysis of microbial genomes. the availability of complete genome sequences has enabled the development of high-throughput nucleic acid hybridization technologies including macro- and microarrays. microarrays have the capacity to monitor the genome content of bacterial strains or species very rapidly. although whole-genome sequencing is definitely a powerful method for genetics, it is still expensive and time consuming. as an alternative, comparative genomic hybridization  experiments based on microarrays have been used to facilitate comparisons of unsequenced bacterial genomes. array-based cgh using genome-wide dna microarrays is used commonly to determine the genomic content of bacterial strains  <cit> , but also for inter-species comparisons  <cit> . in this case, microarrays of closely related microorganisms that have been fully sequenced must be available. the primary advantage of this microarray approach is that it allows the identification of a large number of genes that are potentially present in an organism without the need for sequencing genomes. the disadvantage of this approach is that it indicates only the genes that are common between the fully sequenced relative and the strain of interest; genes unique to the strain of interest remain unknown  <cit> . in the present work the genetic content of l. garvieae cect  <dig> was studied by a combination of in silico analysis and in vitro microarray cgh experiments, using open reading frame  microarrays of two bacteria closely related to l. garvieae, namely lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> and streptococcus pneumoniae tigr <dig>  <cit> .

methods
bacterial strains, culture conditions and isolation of genomic dna
lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il <dig>  and streptococcus pneumoniae tigr <dig>  were used as the reference sequenced microorganisms. the test strain of lactococcus garvieae used for the experiments was cect  <dig> . the l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> and l. garvieae cect  <dig> were grown statically at 28°c in bhi broth . the s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> was grown statically at 37°c in todd hewitt broth . cells were grown until the late-exponential phase of growth  and harvested for isolation and purification of genomic dna using the dneasy blood and tissue kit  according to the manufacturer's specifications. the dna concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically.

dna labelling
aliquots  of genomic dna from the three strains were labelled fluorescently with cy3-dutp or cy5-dutp , depending on whether the strain was used as a test or reference microorganism in the cgh experiments, respectively. each dna aliquot was fragmented by sonication to obtain fragments from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. fragmented dna was mixed with  <dig> μl 10× neblot labelling buffer containing random sequence octamer oligonucleotides  and water to a final volume of  <dig>  μl. this mixture was denatured by heating at 95°c for  <dig> min and then cooled for  <dig> min at 4°c. after this denaturing step, the remaining components of the labelling reaction were added:  <dig> μl of  <dig> × dntp labelling mix  ,  <dig>  μl of  <dig> mm cy3-dutp or cy5-dutp and  <dig>  μl of  <dig> u/μl klenow fragment . the labelling reactions were incubated overnight at 37°c and then stopped by adding  <dig>  μl of  <dig>  m edta. labelled dna was purified from unincorporated label using a qiaquick pcr cleanup kit  and dried under vacuum. the final dna concentration and quality, as well as the labelling quality, were determined using a nanodrop .

array-based comparative genome hybridization 
the l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> and s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> microarrays used for the cgh analysis were purchased from eurogentec . the l. lactis microarray contains  <dig> spots:  <dig> duplicated orfs,  <dig> negative controls and  <dig> empty spots. the s. pneumoniae microarray contains  <dig> spots:  <dig> duplicated orfs,  <dig> negative controls and  <dig> empty spots.

the cgh experiments were performed by means of competitive hybridizations using dna of l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> or s. pneumoniae tigr <dig>  depending on the array, as positive controls. the dnas to be hybridized on the same array were labelled with cy3-dutp and cy5-dutp, respectively. for each microarray hybridization reaction, aliquots  of labelled genomic dnas of the reference  and test  strains, were mixed in  <dig> μl egt hybridization solution  and denatured at 65°c for  <dig> min. the hybridization mixture was then loaded onto a microarray slide, covered with a coverslip and incubated at 38°c overnight. following hybridization, the slides were washed in  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> % sds for  <dig> min followed by a second wash step in  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> % sds for  <dig> min. finally, slides were rinsed in  <dig>  × ssc and dried by centrifugation.

the results presented herein represent a compilation of sixteen separate cgh experiments: l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> arrays  were hybridized with s. pneumoniae tigr <dig>  ; s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> arrays  were hybridized with l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig>  ; l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> arrays  were hybridized with l. garvieae cect  <dig>  ; s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> arrays  were hybridized with l. garvieae cect  <dig>  . the data discussed in this publication have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig> 

data acquisition and analysis
the microarray was scanned after hybridization using a scanarray ht microarray scanner . the signal intensity of the two fluors was determined using imagene software . microarray data were analysed using imagene software, microsoft excel and an in-house designed and built microsoft access database  <cit> . gene calling was based on a signal-to-noise ratio  > <dig> for each spot. after the cgh experiments, a gene was considered to show a positive result when it was present in at least three of the four cgh assays. in the case of the l. garvieae cect  <dig> hybridizations with the l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> arrays, it was necessary to perform a larger number of assays , owing to the poor quality of one of the batches of arrays used. thus, the criterion chosen to determine a positive result in this case was when the gene was present in at least five of the eight cgh assays.

in silico sequence analysis
sequence analyses were carried out to assess the performance of the inter-species cgh protocol. using the blat  <cit>  and blast  <cit>  programs, the sequences of the l. lactis microarray probes were aligned with the s. pneumoniae genome sequence, and vice-versa. the blat search parameters were 90%, 80% and 70% sequence identity  and a  <dig> bp minimum alignment length . available l. garvieae sequences of the nine previously identified genes that were positive in the cgh were aligned with the l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> or s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> genomes and with the sequences of the immobilized probes of these genes in the corresponding microarray using blast  <cit>  and blast  <dig> sequences  <cit>  programs.

RESULTS
inter-species comparison framework
in silico analyses were performed to compare the sequences of the immobilized probes in the microarray of each reference organism with the sequences of their complete genomes available in genbank . the blat alignment of the l. lactis il <dig> probes on the s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> genome allowed the identification of  <dig> orf with blat <dig>   <dig> orfs with blat <dig> and  <dig> orfs with blat <dig>  moreover, the blat alignment of the probes represented on the s. pneumoniae microarray on the l. lactis genome demonstrated  <dig> orf,  <dig> orfs and  <dig> orfs for blat <dig>  blat <dig> and blat <dig>  respectively.

the cgh experiments based on swapping off the microarrays between s. pneumoniae and l. lactis identified  <dig> common orfs. to evaluate the accuracy of the microarray cgh experiments, we compared these results with those of the in silico analysis. out of the  <dig> genes,  <dig>  showed similarities greater than 80%,  <dig> genes  exhibited a similarity between 70% and 80%, and only  <dig> genes  showed a similarity slightly lower than 70%  . in summary, 97% of the genes detected by cgh showed similarities greater than 70% at the nucleotide level.

after combined analysis of the results obtained in silico and in vitro, we established, under the hybridization conditions used in this study, a detection threshold based on a sequence similarity of ≥ 70% for alignments longer than  <dig> bp. this was established as the reference framework for the inter-species cgh assays.

in vitro microarray cgh experiments with l. garvieae cect  <dig> vs reference microorganisms l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> and s. pneumoniae tigr <dig>  and in silico analysis of available sequences from l. garvieae
the microarray cgh experiments identified  <dig> genes in l. garvieae that had analogues in l. lactis and/or s. pneumoniae . of these,  <dig> genes  were identified only with the l. lactis microarray,  <dig> genes  only with the microarray of s. pneumoniae, and  <dig> genes  were identified with both microarrays. these genes belong to diverse functional groups . most of the genes  have been documented for the first time in l. garvieae. only nine genes  out of the  <dig> genes detected have been either identified or sequenced before in diverse strains of l. garvieae . in silico analysis of these previously sequenced genes  of l. garvieae were performed to assess the efficacy of the methodology. alignments of these available sequences with the genomes of the corresponding reference microorganism and their respective array probes showed nucleotide identities ranging between 70% and 86% . most of the available sequences  showed similarities greater than 75%.

discussion
in the present study, commercial microarrays of l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> and s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> were used to determine the presence of homologous genes in l. garvieae. both l. lactis and s. pneumoniae were chosen as reference organisms because they are closely related to l. garvieae  <cit>  and their genomes have been fully sequenced. although these cgh experiments cannot detect and identify genes that are likely to exist only in the target microorganism, this approach reveals genes that are common to both the reference and the target organisms, allowing the identification of a large number of genes potentially present in an organism without the need for sequencing genomes  <cit> .

in experiments that involve inter-species comparison it is necessary to establish a framework that allows accurate comparison and interpretation of the results. thus, the first efforts were focused on establishing that framework by the combination and integration of in silico analyses and in vitro microarray cgh experiments to compare the reference organisms l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> and s. pneumoniae tigr <dig>  signal intensity has been used to assess the level of similarity between two genes in inter-species cgh experiments  <cit> . however, this approach may be influenced, and therefore biased, by different factors, such as regional sample labelling effects, probe accessibility or local hybridization issues  <cit> . for these reasons, in the present study signal intensity was not considered for determining whether a gene was positive or not in the inter-species cgh experiments.

these analyses revealed that nearly all the genes common to l. lactis and s. pneumoniae that were detected by swap microarray cgh experiments  exhibited a sequence similarity of at least 70% . only two genes  detected in the microarray cgh experiments showed a sequence similarity slightly lower than 70% . variability in the factors that influence the cgh signals, such as systematic errors , copy number variation, and sequence divergence between the analysed samples  <cit> , may explain these results. the comparison of the results of both analyses, in silico and in vitro, for the reference microorganisms  allowed us to establish that, under our experimental conditions, it was possible to detect and identify inter-species hybridization with a detection threshold based on a sequence similarity of ≥70%.

therefore, our threshold value of sequence similarity ≥70% was set up directly from the comparison of the results of the in silico and in vitro analyses of the present study. this threshold value was used subsequently to interpret the results of the microarray-based cgh experiments comparing l. garvieae and the reference microorganisms. less stringent hybridization conditions would probably have allowed the identification of a larger number of genes, but this would have also resulted in lower specificity. given that the final aim of the experiment was the identification of genes potentially present in l garvieae, it was preferred to maintain stringent hybridization conditions, therefore increasing the specificity and the reliability of the results. hence, the genes detected in the cgh experiments should have an analogue in l. garvieae with a nucleotide sequence identity greater than 70% with the respective gene in the reference organism.

the cgh hybridizations using l. lactis subsp. lactis il <dig> and s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> microarrays identified  <dig> analogous genes in l. garvieae . only  <dig> % of these genes  have been characterized or sequenced previously by other groups in different strains of l. garvieae . the alignments of the available sequences of these nine previously of these nine previously identified genes in l. garvieae with both the sequences of these genes from the reference microorganisms and those from the array probe showed nucleotide similarities greater than 70%  between them . these data are consistent with the detection threshold value discussed previously. therefore it is reasonable to assume that the other genes detected in l. garvieae cect  <dig> by cgh experiments will also have at least 70% sequence similarity with the respective genes in the reference microorganisms. the positive result obtained in both cgh experiments for the tig/sp <dig> gene , was unexpected given the absence of similarity between the available sequence and the probes on both microarrays. this result could be explained by the fact that the available sequence for l. garvieae is partial, and it represents a part of the gene that does not correspond with the probe.

we classified the orfs into clusters of orthologous genes   <cit> . the  <dig> genes identified in l. garvieae cect  <dig>  belong to diverse biological functional groups . most of the genes detected in l. garvieae  were related to meaningful biological functions such as those related to ribosomal functions, sugar metabolism or energy conversion systems, which are usually represented in lactobacillales  <cit> . the remaining genes identified included "housekeeping genes", such as gyrb, soda, reca, iles, rpod, dnak and ddl  <cit> , genes of diverse functional groups and genes with unknown functions. some of them are of interest because they could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections. for example, the gene als, which has been described as an important factor for host colonization by el tor biotypes of vibrio cholerae  <cit> , has also been suggested to be one of the genes required for survival of l. garvieae in fish  <cit> . in addition, the gene myca, which was detected for the first time in l. garvieae in the present study, encodes an antigen that cross-reacts with myosin, and members of this family of proteins have been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections  <cit> .

sequencing of the genes identified in this work is beyond the scope of this initial study, but the data provided can be the starting point for future genetic analysis of l. garvieae strains from different ecological niches or adapted to different host species.

this study provides the first insight into the genome content of l. garvieae and suggests that chg could be a useful approach for studying the genetic content of other gram-positive catalase-negative cocci of human and veterinary relevance.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, a comparative analysis based on microarray interspecies hybridization and on the use of bioinformatic tools was used for the first time to study the genetic content of l. garvieae cect  <dig>  it is important to remark that the integration of results from bioinformatics and microarray-based cgh requires the definition of a framework that allows an accurate comparison and interpretation of the results obtained. once this framework was established, it was possible to identify  <dig> genes potentially present in l. garvieae cect  <dig>  some of the identified genes, such as the als and myca genes, could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections.

in summary, these results provide the first insight into the genome content of l. garvieae and could be useful for future understanding of the genetics of this pathogenic microorganism.
