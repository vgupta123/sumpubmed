BACKGROUND
polyhydroxyalkanoates  are intracellular storage materials of carbon and energy in many prokaryotes. ralstonia eutropha is the most prominent and best-studied poly accumulating bacterium  <cit> . the results of  <dig> years of research on biosynthesis, maintenance, intracellular degradation  and application of pha meanwhile provide a good picture on the structure and components of phb granules. phb granules are composed of an amorphous polymer core that is enclosed by a dense proteinaceous surface layer . polymer and surface layer constitute a multifunctional complex for which the term carbonosomes has been proposed  <cit> . it is still an open question whether phospholipids  <cit>  are part of the phb granule surface layer in vivo or whether they represent an in vitro preparation artifact that occurs upon cell lysis in course of the isolation process of so-called native phb granules.

six types of proteins constitute the proteinaceous phb surface layer in r. eutropha:  the phb synthase  is the key enzyme of phb synthesis and catalyses the polymerization process of 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa provided by the central metabolism  <cit> . the function of a second - catalytically inactive - phb synthase, phac <dig>  <cit>  is unknown. however, phac <dig> principally has the capacity to bind to phb granules in vivo  <cit> ;  phasin proteins , in particular phap <dig>  cover most parts of the granule surface and prevent coalescence of granules  <cit> ;  phb depolymerases  are important for reutilization  of the polymer during times of starvation  <cit> ;  oligomer hydrolases  are involved in cleavage of intermediately formed 3-hydroxybutyrate  oligomers during mobilization  <cit> ;  regulatory proteins  regulate expression of selected phasin genes  <cit>  and  pham represents the prototype of a recently discovered novel type of phb granule associated protein that has phasin properties but also can bind to dna  <cit> .

however, despite this considerable amount of knowledge it is still an open question whether phb granules are formed randomly within the cytoplasm or whether localization of phb granules is controlled by the bacteria. several studies using fluorescence microscopy   <cit>  and transmission electron microscopy   <cit>  were performed in the last decade to address this question. however, the results of these studies were inconsistent. while fm analysis of phb granule formation in different phb accumulating species suggested a non random localization of “early” phb granules in the cell periphery of these species  <cit> , investigation of phb granule formation in r. eutropha by tem suggested that phb granules are formed predominantly in the cell centre near dark stained “mediation elements”  <cit> . electron cryotomography recently revealed that in r. eutropha phb granules at different stages of phb accumulation are localized more or less in the cell center whereas a preferential formation of phb granules in the cell periphery has not been observed  <cit> . the reason why fm and tem resulted in apparently contradicting results remained unclear although the studies were performed with the same wild type strain. in recent studies of our laboratory we showed that pham can bind to phb, to phasin phap <dig>  to phb synthase phac <dig> and to dna  <cit> . consequently, we decided to reinvestigate phb granule formation and intracellular localization in r. eutropha wild type and in mutants with altered expression of phap <dig> or pham. our results show that phb granules are localized in close contact to the nucleoid if pham is present and are detached from the nucleoid when phap <dig> is over-expressed.

RESULTS
time course of phb granule formation in r. eutropha hf <dig> and h16
to study the formation and localization of phb granules in r. eutropha we used r. eutropha strains h <dig> and hf <dig>  both strains have wild type properties with respect to phb metabolism and easily form phb granules during growth on rich media such as nb medium media. strain hf <dig> is a spontaneous streptomycin resistant mutant of strain h <dig> and has often been used in place of strain h <dig> in conjugation experiments because of simplified counter selection of the donor  <cit> . in this study, the same results were obtained for both strains with the exception that strain hf <dig> grew slightly slower and produced in average a lower number of phb granules than strain h <dig> 

although r. eutropha strains h <dig> and hf <dig> intermediately accumulated phb during growth on nb-medium more than 95% of the cells were free of phb granules in the stationary growth phase after  <dig> h. cells that still had phb granules after this time period  often were division-inhibited  and many of them were dead as revealed by staining with propidium iodide . in conclusion, most living cells of the late stationary growth phase of r. eutropha on nb-medium were free of accumulated phb.

to monitor the time course of phb granule formation we transferred phb-free stationary r. eutropha cells to fresh nb-medium that had been additionally supplemented with  <dig> % sodium gluconate. this increased the c to n ratio of the medium and promoted phb accumulation. samples were taken at zero time and after  <dig> min to several hours of growth. harvested cells were chemically fixed, embedded in a low viscosity acrylic resin and subjected to thin section electron transmission microscopy. phb granules poorly bind heavy atom stains and therefore have an electron-transparent  appearance. the results are as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the genomic dna of the cells denatures during the fixation process and can be identified in stained thin sections by the different degree of staining intensity in comparison to the cytoplasm   <cit> . in some cells the denatured nucleoids were more intensively stained than in others . occasionally , stationary cells revealed small circular structures of about 50– <dig> nm in diameter with light staining. this structure is likely a remains of small phb granules . phb is a hydrophobic material and does not bind uranyl acetate or lead citrate that was added to increase the contrast of organic materials in tem pictures. phb granules therefore have an electron-transparent appearance. in case of very small phb granules the diameters of the granules can be smaller than the thickness of a thin-section in transmission electron microscopy. in such cases, or if only a portion of a phb granule is present within the volume of a thin-section, the appearance of the granules is not a complete “white” but “light grey”. this can be explained by the presence of stained material that was bound to materials of the cytoplasm above or below the granule. in contrast, large phb granules have a diameter of  <dig> to  <dig> nm and are likely to span the complete volume of a thin-section. large phb granules therefore appear “white” in tem images . remarkably, the phb granule visible in figure  <dig>  seems to be attached to the nucleoid region. no difference was observed between strain h <dig> and strain hf <dig> at zero time.

when cells were investigated that had been grown under phb permissive conditions for  <dig> min to  <dig> hour many cells harboured one or two phb granules . all granules were in contact to the nucleoid region. the size of the granules ranged between less than  <dig> and ≈  <dig> nm within the first hour of growth. in cells that harboured two phb granules the granules mostly were located at opposite sites of the nucleoid region. this observation is in line with previous observations made by fluorescence microscopy .

when cells were investigated that had been grown for > <dig> h permissive for phb synthesis the number and size of the granules further increased. strain h <dig> accumulated in average more granules  than strain hf <dig> . since the diameter of accumulated phb granules increased by time the volume of the granules also increased and the association of the granules with the nucleoid became less obvious and could not be differentiated from nucleoid exclusion; however it should be noted that for all cells shown in figure  <dig>  in which phb granules and the nucleoid were visible, an association of the granules with the nucleoid is evident. in conclusion, the data suggest that phb granules are rapidly formed under permissive conditions  and apparently are attached to the nucleoid region. since pham binds to both dna and phb we speculated that pham is responsible for the association of phb granules with the nucleoid .

time course of formation and subcellular localization of phb granules in r. eutropha that over-express pham
pham represents a new type of phb granule associated protein and has multiple functions. it had been identified by its in vivo interaction with phb synthase phac <dig> in a two-hybrid screening assay  <cit> . fm analysis revealed that pham is not only able to bind to phb granules but also to the nucleoid region in r. eutropha. moreover, purified pham was able to bind to genomic dna in vitro as indicated in gel mobility shift experiments. to investigate the effect of pham on phb granule formation the pham gene was over-expressed constitutively from the phac <dig> promotor. figure  <dig> shows the time course of phb granule formation in the pham-over-expressing transconjugant of r. eutropha h <dig> and hf <dig>  no difference in number, size or localization of phb granules was found when pham-over-expressing cells were compared with eyfp-pham over-expressing cells and confirmed that the presence of an eyfp tag did not change subcellular localization of fusion proteins. most cells were free of phb granules at zero time and the nucleoid region could be differentiated from the cytoplasm by the different degree of adsorbed staining material similar to wild type cells. phb granules appeared already after 10– <dig> min of incubation under phb permissive conditions. at later time points the number of phb granules strongly increased up to several dozens. the granules were considerably smaller in diameter  compared to wild type cells at all stages of growth and the granule size increased only little after longer incubation times at phb permissive conditions. remarkably, the granules were not randomly distributed in the cells but were exclusively in contact with or in close neighbourhood to the nucleoid. the phb granules covered the complete surface of the nucleoid region in some cells. occasionally, long cells were observed that apparently were inhibited in cell division . such cells harboured several well-separated nucleoid regions each of which was decorated with a high number of attached phb granules resulting in the impression of “raspberries” within the cells. free phb granules, i.e. phb granules that were not in contact to the nucleoid region were not observed. apparently, constitutive over-expression of pham resulted in formation of an increased number of small and nucleoid-attached phb granules.

if pham is responsible for the formation of small granules and for the close contact to the nucleoid region, deletion of pham should have a phenotype. in fact, r. eutropha ∆pham cells accumulated only very few  phb granules that were significantly larger in diameter than those of the pham over-expressing mutant or of the wild type . since the diameters of phb granules of the ∆pham strain were considerably larger even at early time points a precise analysis whether or not the granules were attached to the nucleoid region was difficult. in most ∆pham cells the phb granules were still located close to the nucleoid; however, at least in some cells a detachment of phb granules from the nucleoid region could not be excluded for the wild type or for the pham over-expressing strain. a clear decision whether the absence of pham resulted in detachment from the nucleoid can, however, not be made. since r. eutropha expresses at least one other protein with dna-binding and phb-binding property   <cit>  it might be that phar also contributes to association of phb with dna. in summary, our data on mutants with altered expression of pham clearly show that number, diameter and subcellular localization of phb granules depends on the presence and concentration of pham.

time course of formation and localization of phb granules in r. eutropha over-expressing phap5
phap <dig> had previously been identified as a phasin in r. eutropha by its in vivo interaction with phap <dig> and other phasins  <cit> . remarkably, phap <dig> also interacted with pham. to investigate the influence of phap <dig> on phb granule formation the phap <dig> gene was cloned in a broad host range plasmid  under control of the strong and constitutive phac <dig> promotor , transferred to r. eutropha h <dig> and hf <dig> via conjugation and investigated for phb granules formation and localization under phb permissive conditions . in case of strain hf <dig> a eypf-phap <dig> fusion was cloned and used to confirm localization of phap <dig> on the phb granules by fluorescence microscopy. controls showed that free eyfp is a soluble protein in r. eutropha . 

as in the case of pham, no difference in number, size and localization of phb granules was observed for the over-expressed eyfp-phap <dig> fusion in comparison to over-expression of phap <dig> alone. growth and accumulation of phb were similar in the recombinant strains as in the wild type. however, when the time-course of phb granule formation and localization was investigated by tem-analysis remarkable differences to the wild type were observed for the phap <dig> over-expressing strains : phb granules were formed in aggregated clusters of in average 2– <dig> granules in most cells near both cell poles of the rod-shaped cells. these clusters could not be resolved by fm-analysis  and resulted in the impression of only two  phb granules near the cell poles . the number of individual granules visible in tem images was increased but the diameter was decreased compared to wild type granules. in most cells, the phb granule clusters or at least individual phb granules of a cluster were clearly detached from the nucleoid region . in conclusion, over-expression of phap <dig> has an impact on number, size and localization of phb granules and leads to detachment of the granules from the nucleoid. this can be explained by binding of over-expressed phap <dig> to pham molecules thus preventing pham from binding to dna and/or to phac. alternatively, a competitive displacement of pham molecules from phb granules surface by over-expressed phap <dig> could be responsible for the phenotype. number and localization of phb granules in a ∆phap <dig> strain were, however, not significantly changed in comparison to wild type .

CONCLUSIONS
our data clearly show that formation and localization of phb granules occurs not randomly but is specifically controlled in r. eutropha. other examples of species with non-random localization of phb granules are rhodospirillum rubrum <cit> , haloquadrata walsbyi, azotobacter vinelandii, beijerinckia indica <cit> , caryophanon latum <cit>  and hyphomicrobium facile . however, we do not know whether attachment of phb or pha granules to the dna is a general feature of phb or pha accumulating bacteria. phb granules in r. eutropha are attached to the nucleoid via pham. our conclusion is supported by previous tem analysis of others if the “dark-stained mediation elements” are interpreted as denatured chromosomal dna  <cit> . the reason why the authors of these studies did not observe phb granules in the cell periphery in thin sections might be explained by differences in growth conditions of the bacteria: they used a mineral salts-based phb production medium with high carbon but low nitrogen source; first samples were taken after  <dig>  h of incubation. at this time the nitrogen source should have been consumed resulting in strong phb accumulation but also in stop of nucleoid replication. in our experiments, the cells were subjected to high carbon  and high nitrogen  sources resulting in cell growth and phb granule formation. active separation of the replicated chromosomes with bound phb granules resulted in formation of cells with phb granules that often localized near the cell poles. therefore, the results of tian et al. are not contradictionary to our findings. moreover, our data are also in agreement with recent biochemical work of the same group in which an association of phb and pham was confirmed  <cit> .

over-expression of phasin phap <dig> leads to detachment of phb granules from the nucleoid probably because of competitive binding to pham. however, the expression level of phap <dig> in r. eutropha wild type is only low as indicated by transcriptome data  <cit> . an involvement of additional proteins in subcellular localization can not be excluded.
