BACKGROUND
galectin- <dig> , encoded by the gene lgals <dig>  belongs to the family of β-galactoside-binding proteins . alternative splicing of lgals <dig> results in two protein isoforms  <cit> : prototype galectins, which contain a single carbohydrate recognition domain, and tandem-repeat galectins, which contain two carbohydrate recognition domains  with distinct binding affinities  and different evolutionary origins  <cit> . gal- <dig> is an important regulator of cell adhesion in adult tissues  <cit>  and is differentially expressed in normal and cancer tissues  <cit> . during avian embryogenesis, gal- <dig> is expressed in the limb bud and mediates the patterning of the precartilage mesenchymal condensations that constitute the primordia of the appendicular skeleton  <cit> . specifically, gal- <dig> upregulates expression of gal-1a, the cell adhesive homolog of gal- <dig>  through a mutually reinforcing feedback loop while also inhibiting cell adhesion by competing with the binding of gal-1a to its cognate ligand/receptor  <cit> .

represented in the form of a mathematical model  <cit> , these findings suggest that the two galectins participate in a reaction-diffusion-type mechanism  <cit>  of the kind that best integrates the patterning and morphogenesis of skeletal elements during limb skeletal pattern formation . such empirically based models allow for testable hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of endoskeletal diversity in tetrapod appendages. specifically, they can be used to explore how the modulation of parameters of these patterning networks may have been responsible for differences observed in limb skeletal anatomy between major gnathostome clades  <cit> .

the paired fins and limbs of gnathostomes are characterized by endoskeletal elements   <cit> . gal-1a is the gal- <dig> homolog that mediates precartilage condensation formation in the chicken. the gal-1 s of actinopterygians  resemble gal-1a more closely in sequence and fold than they do the non-skeletogenic homolog of gal- <dig> , which evolved in the sauropsid lineage   <cit> . furthermore, genes encoding some of the gal- <dig> homologs in amphibians and the single gene encoding gal- <dig> in mouse specify proteins with the gal-1a-type fold structure seen in the ray-finned fish and sauropsids. therefore, a potentially cartilage-inducing gal- <dig> homolog is likely to have evolved before the origin of digits and thus was not the key factor responsible for innovating the tetrapod limb skeletal patterning network.

to trace the origin of the tetrapod skeletal patterning network we therefore turned our attention to gal- <dig>  which in the chicken limb regulates the number and spacing of condensations, not their initiation and morphogenesis  <cit> . here we used a combination of phylogenetic methods to compare the evolution of sarcopterygian and actinopterygian gal-8s relative to their chondrichthyan ortholog. with respect to synteny, selected sequence signatures at the gene level, and residue conservation at the protein level, actinopterygian gal-8s differ more extensively from their chondrichthyan orthologs than do sarcopterygian gal-8s. employing a previously described mathematical model of the galectin-based patterning network for avian limb skeletogenesis  <cit> , we show how changes in both the regulation of gene expression and in the coding sequence of gal- <dig> could have enabled the transformation of a precartilage condensation pattern like that of chondrichthyan fins to one characteristic of tetrapod limbs.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of gal- <dig> protein sequence shows a deep split between actinopterygii and sarcopterygii
we used peptide sequences of the homologs of gal- <dig> protein from representatives of the vertebrate classes: actinopterygii, the sarcopterygian classes amphibia, reptilia, aves, mammalia, and actinistia , to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using callorhinchus milii  as an outgroup . rooting the ml tree using c. milii as the outgroup reveals that actinopterygii and sarcopterygii each form a monophyletic clade with strong branch support. the examined actinopterygian genomes encoded at least two gal- <dig> homologs that segregated into two distinct clusters. there were two exceptions to this pattern. lepisosteus oculatus: the spotted gar, a non-teleost had only one ortholog. danio rerio,  a teleost had two gal- <dig> homologs, both of which were part of the same cluster. our tree topology suggests that a duplication of genes encoding actinopterygian gal- <dig> took place before the divergence between spotted gar and the teleosts. it also suggests that several species, including the spotted gar lost orthologs of gal- <dig> at different times during their evolutionary history.fig.  <dig> tree-based phylogeny of vertebrate gal- <dig> homologs. a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed using protein sequences of vertebrate gal-8s shows a deep split between actinopterygii and sarcopterygii with strong bootstrap support. actinopterygian gal-8s segregate into two distinct clusters that is likely the result of genome duplication. gal- <dig> sequence of the elephant shark c. milii was used as an outgroup



actinopterygian and sarcopterygian lgals8s show distinct synteny
the divergence between actinopterygian and sarcopterygian gal-8s at the level of protein sequence led us to investigate whether additional genomic changes pertaining to lgals <dig> coincided with the split of the two clades. we observed that the genes surrounding lgals <dig> in all sarcopterygian genomes we examined were distinct from those surrounding its homologs in actinopterygian genomes, suggesting that lgals <dig> synteny is conserved within, and distinct between, these clades .fig.  <dig> syntenic comparison of vertebrate lgals <dig> homologs in chordates. syntenies of lgals <dig> in chondrichthyan elephant shark , of both lgals <dig> paralogs in actinopterygii , and of lgals <dig> in sarcopterygii 



to determine whether one of the lgals <dig> syntenies was ancestral to the other, we mapped the synteny of the lgals <dig> homolog in elephant shark. orthologs of two genes actn2b and heatr <dig> were observed to flank the lgals <dig> ortholog of elephant shark. both these genes are also proximal to lgals <dig> of every sarcopterygian species examined  but not part of actinopterygian lgals <dig> syntenies. we then searched for heatr <dig> in the spotted gar genome and found its ortholog proximal to those for actin2b and edaradd. the proximity in positions of these three genes was absent in teleost genomes. in spotted gar, we observed lgals <dig> in a new location flanked by kif <dig>  rrm <dig>  tmem <dig> and arid1b. in teleosts, all of which were observed to have two lgals <dig> paralogs, the flanking genes for each overlapped partially with their spotted gar paralogs but not with each other. in sarcopterygian genomes, the orthologs of actin2b and heatr <dig> were found to flank lgals <dig>  our findings suggest that a single genome transposition of lgals <dig> took place very early in the actinopterygian lineage, before the divergence of gar and teleosts. this transposition was followed by the teleost genome duplication. post-duplication genome evolutionary dynamics is probably responsible for the largely non-overlapping syntenies of the actinopterygian lgals <dig> paralogs. the synteny of lgals <dig> in the elephant shark was therefore retained in the sarcopterygian lineage.

sarcopterygian gal- <dig> evolved more slowly than actinopterygian gal-8
to test whether the translocation of lgals <dig> to a new chromosomal site in actinopterygii was accompanied by an altered rate of evolution  <cit> , we used the branch site test  to compare the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions of lgals <dig> in the sarcopterygian and actinopterygian lineages. we considered the phylogenetic tree consisting of nucleotide sequences of lgals <dig> belonging to the sarcopterygian lineage and the outgroup elephant shark and focused on the basal branch leading up to the actinopterygian lgals <dig> as the foreground branch. here, the paml <dig> branch site test revealed that 4 % of gal- <dig> amino acids that have evolved neutrally  or under purifying selection  in the background branches have accumulated non-synonymous substitutions under historical positive selection in the actinopterygian lineage . of the residues identified as having potentially been subject to positive selection, gln <dig>  which is conserved across gal- <dig> homologs of sarcopterygians and in the elephant shark is replaced by ser/thr/met in the actinopterygians. the residue gln <dig> is part of subsite c of the gal-8 n crd which accommodates the long sialylated oligosaccharides known to bind the domain  <cit> . lys <dig>  which flanks trp <dig> , and is conserved in sarcopterygians, is replaced in actinopterygians with cys, arg or leu. other residues under potential positive selection within actinopterygii are arg <dig> and thr <dig> table  <dig> dn/ds for different site classes in gal- <dig> using branch site test  



in the gal- <dig> c-crd, we identified one potential residue under possible positive selection in actinopterygii: glu <dig>  which is conserved in sarcopterygians but substituted with pro, his, ser or gln in actinopterygians. we next sought to determine whether sarcopterygian gal-8s were more similar to shark gal- <dig> or to their actinopterygian counterparts. we aligned actinopterygian and sarcopterygian sequences, taking into account the crystallographically elucidated secondary structure of the human gal- <dig> crd  <cit>  and quantified shared invariant and variant residues specific to each class. we then overlaid both sets with the shark gal- <dig> sequence and performed a similar analysis . we found that sarcopterygian gal-8s shared a higher percentage of strongly and weakly conserved residues with shark gal- <dig> than the latter did with actinopterygian gal-8s . both crds of sarcopterygian gal- <dig> show higher residue conservation than their actinopterygian counterparts, with n-crd showing relatively greater conservation. we also found greater conservation of residues in the short sequence that precedes the sarcopterygian gal-8 n-crd sequence relative to those of actinopterygians .

a broad range of gal- <dig> structural and expression parameters is consistent with endoskeletal patterning by the gal-1-gal- <dig> network
we had previously used a mathematical representation of the gal-1-gal- <dig> network to identify gal-8-related parameters whose variations modulate condensation patterning  <cit> . patterns capable of being produced by the described mechanism include repeated cartilage elements with regular spacing comparable to the element widths  <cit> . for the purposes of the present paper, we define a system as “patterned” when it exhibits two or more such elements. one such modulatory network parameter is β: a function of the binding affinity of this galectin to its receptors. this parameter has an obvious relationship to the 3d fold structure, and hence the sequence, of gal- <dig>  the evidence described above for purifying selection and sequence conservation of sarcopterygian gal-8s, including regions known to be involved in binding to its carbohydrate ligands, suggests a phylogenetic constraint on β values during tetrapod evolution. this assumes, as suggested by previous evidence  <cit> , that the relevant folds of gal- <dig> have been subject to purifying selection since their origination.

in the present work we ran simulations to explore the range of β values that are consistent or inconsistent with condensation pattern formation . another parameter with predicted effect on condensation patterning is μ: a function determining the rate of expression of gal- <dig>  we found that, as with β, there are sets of values of μ that are consistent with, and others inconsistent with, condensation formation. we were therefore able to identify a bounded region in β-μ bi-parameter space permissive for condensation patterning outside of which no condensation patterns form . the model discussed here  <cit>  differs from other reaction-diffusion type models that have been used to represent digit patterning  in that cell adhesion is explicitly simulated and regarded as crucial for pattern formation.fig.  <dig> exploration of condensation-permissive parameter space of a mathematical model of limb patterning. two-parameter bifurcation diagram showing the dependence of condensation patterns on μ, the expression rate of gal- <dig>  shown on the vertical axis and binding affinity β shown on the horizontal axis. computations are based on the mathematical model in  <cit> . approximate contours demarcating condensation numbers  are shown via a heat map within the condensation region



the model further predicts that a fine regulation of gal- <dig> can potentially mediate condensation patterning that corresponds to a stereotypical tetrapod-type limb skeleton, i.e., small numbers of region-specific elements, usually increasing in number along the proximodistal axis . gal- <dig> can participate in skeletogenic interactions with gal- <dig> only if it is capable of reversibly competing with the condensation-promoting role of gal- <dig>  this competition thus corresponds to range of β from about  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the relative units used to characterize the parameter space for the simulations mapped in fig.  <dig>  consistently generating small numbers of elements would involve a constraint on β to a range of values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for  <dig>  < μ <  <dig> and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for 2 < μ <  <dig> .fig.  <dig> endoskeletal morphologies of selected gnathostome species. for each taxa, anterior is up.  top, catshark - scyliorhinus canicula; middle, shark hemiscyllium ocellatum, bottom, shark centroscymnus owstoni;  top, lobe-finned fish fossil sauripteryus, middle, lobe-finned fish fossil panderichthys, bottom, coelacanth, latimeria;  top, ray-finned paddlefish polyodon, middle, ray-finned zebrafish danio rerio, bottom, ray-finned fish polypterus, top, pantropical spotted dolphin stenella attenuate, middle, mouse mus musculus, bottom, chicken gallus gallus. not to scale. shaded region represents animals with limb skeletons putatively containing incipient or definitive forms of the gal1-gal- <dig> patterning network. catshark, mouse, paddlefish and zebrafish redrawn from  <cit> ; hemiscyllium and centroscymnus redrawn from  <cit> ; sauripteryus, panderichthys and chicken from  <cit> ; coelacanth redrawn from  <cit> ; dolphin redrawn from  <cit> ; polypterus based on  <cit> 



a comparison of the structure of human gal- <dig> with those of chicken gal-1a and gal-1b , shows a greater similarity between the folds of each of the crds of human gal- <dig>  and the fold of chicken gal-1a, than with the fold of chicken gal-1b . gal- <dig> in sarcopterygii therefore appears to have evolved under pressure to remain similar in fold to the basal  isoform of gal- <dig>  such purifying selection could have ensured that gal- <dig> binding to its shared ligand with gal- <dig> was in a range that made it neither negligible nor too avid. the crystallographic elucidation of the tertiary folds of sarcopterygian gal- <dig> crds in addition to those of human gal- <dig> would provide a better understanding of how the structure of gal- <dig> evolved in the context of the split between actinopterygii and sarcopterygii. as a corollary, our model predicts that a progressive decrease in element number in the face of a phylogenetic constraint on β could take place through a monotonic increase in values of μ . consistent with this, knocking down the expression of chicken gal- <dig> using rnai in developing chicken limbs led to ectopic digit formation .

a conserved non-coding motif upstream of lgals <dig> is present exclusively in sarcopterygians
in addition to requiring a gal- <dig> with the capacity to interfere with cell-cell adhesion mediated by gal- <dig>  our model predicts that a change in the regulatory regime of the lgals <dig> that would permit its regulated elevated expression may have been instrumental in the emergence of a tetrapod-type patterning network from an ancestral gnathostome one. we therefore analyzed the non-coding regions upstream of a broad selection of lgals <dig> orthologs to identify potential evolutionary changes in determinants of gal- <dig> expression.

we searched for possible sarcopterygian-specific sequence signatures in the non-coding regions adjacent to lgals <dig> and identified a 21 bp non-coding motif in the 2000 bp regions upstream of the promoter for lgals <dig> of gallus gallus , mus musculus  taeniopygia guttata , pelodiscus sinensis , xenopus tropicalis  and latimeria chalumnae  . this conserved non-coding motif  aligned with binding-site motifs for the transcription factors meis <dig> and tcfcp2i <dig> , and runx <dig> and runx <dig> . all four of these transcription factors are expressed in precartilage mesenchyme during limb development  with two of them, meis <dig> and runx <dig>  regulating the proximodistal patterning of embryonic limb buds  <cit> . we searched for this cnm in the near-promoter regions upstream of both lgals <dig> paralogs of the elephant shark and the following actinopterygians: zebrafish, medaka, tetraodon, stickleback, fugu and spotted gar. the motif was statistically below detection within these non-sarcopterygian lgals8-proximal sequences  and was therefore most likely a sarcopterygian innovation. furthermore, we were unable to detect any non-coding motifs that were conserved upstream of lgals <dig> belonging to both or either of the two actinopterygian groups that constituted separate branches of the phylogenetic tree in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> a search for conserved non-coding motifs in the regions immediately upstream of the promoter of vertebrate lgals <dig> homologs. a 21-bp conserved motif  that shows very high probabilities of alignment  within near-promoter upstream regions of lgals <dig> of sarcopterygii but extremely low probabilities of alignment with both paralogous genes of actinopterygii as well as the lgals <dig> homolog of c. milii




discussion
we have provided evidence for significant differences between major gnathostome clades in the evolution of galectin gal- <dig> and its specifying gene lgals <dig>  these differences include conservation within sarcopterygii of the synteny of lgals <dig> in its shared ancestor with cartilaginous fish, and retention of key residues in sarcopterygian gal-8s, presumably by purifying selection, after their divergence from the actinopterygians. furthermore, we also detected the presence of a conserved non-coding motif  containing binding sites for transcription factors preferentially expressed in embryonic tetrapod limb buds upstream of the sarcopterygian gal- <dig> encoding genes.

in light of the skeletogenic two-galectin network we have inferred from investigations of an avian system, we suggest that the new findings presented here on gal- <dig>  in conjunction with earlier work on the phylogenetics and fold-structure of gal- <dig>  <cit>  can provide insight into the evolution and developmental regulation of a sarcopterygian appendicular patterning network in which there is regulated elaboration of small numbers of elements . the elaboration is ultimately refined to the stylopod, zeugopod and autopod of tetrapod vertebrates. in contrast, the endoskeletons of the paired fins of cartilaginous and ray-finned fishes exhibit a wide variety of plates, nodules, and multiple parallel bars of cartilage or endochondral bone . if, as suggested by our analysis, the fins of actinopterygians  evolved unconstrained by a tetrapod-type patterning network , their adaptive radiation could have followed less stereotypical pathways, reflected in both their divergent fin endoskeletal patterns and positive selection on gal- <dig>  in contrast, the stereotypical tetrapod pattern persisted in the fins of vertebrates that became secondarily aquatic.

the constraint on the range of protein conformations of gal- <dig> that appears to have accompanied the galectin-mediated transformation of the appendicular skeletal pattern was based on purifying selection which, according to our residue conservation analysis, was already underway in crown gnathostomes. in terms of our mathematical model, this evolutionary process corresponds to centering the value of the parameter β in the skeletogenic galectin network around  <dig>  in the relative units of the parameter space . according to the experiments that motivated the model  <cit> , these values of β should correspond to a gal- <dig> conformation that allows it to bind to its common receptor with gal- <dig>  but not so strongly that it completely displaces the latter. by the geometry of the parameter space these β values are well within the range permissive for pattern formation, but represent the locus within this space in which the number of elements can be precisely controlled developmentally by changes in the expression level of gal- <dig> 

while the model predicts that a wide range of expression levels of lgals <dig> will be consistent with pattern formation, only elevated levels of the protein lead to the consistently small numbers of elements characteristic of sarcopterygian fin endoskeletons and tetrapod limbs. this is particularly true for values of β around  <dig>  units , although there is nothing in our analysis that precludes individual chondrichthyan and actinopterygian species from having acquired β and μ values that are compatible with small numbers of elements, as is sometimes seen in the skeletal anatomies of these groups  <cit> . if our interpretation is correct that the purifying selection on gal- <dig> in the sarcopterygian lineage  preserved a value of β in the patterning network for which the expression levels of the protein can directly calibrate the number of condensations, then the appearance of a conserved non-coding motif  with multiple potential transcription factor binding sites immediately upstream the promoter of the sarcopterygian lgals <dig> gene becomes of great interest. while it is not presently known which factors  in the developing tetrapod limb regulate the production of gal- <dig>  evidence that this protein came under a novel regulatory regime in sarcopterygians supports the general outline of our model.

in addition to having a small number of discrete skeletal elements, the paired appendages of the vast majority of tetrapods  exhibit a stereotypical proximodistal increase in the number of parallel skeletal elements. this arrangement, as well as the proximodistal order of their generation, are predictable consequences  of the distal suppression of precartilage condensation by the fibroblast growth factor- <dig>  produced by the ectoderm at the limb bud tip  <cit> . indeed, we have observed the in vitro patterning function of this network to be markedly inhibited by fgf <dig>  <cit> .

in a recent publication, hoxa and hoxd enhancers that specify digit and wrist identity in murine limbs were found to be utilized in the distal radial regions of pectoral fins of an actinopterygian fish  <cit> . rather than taking this, as suggested, as evidence of homology of these elements across these distant groups  <cit> , we are led by our results to consider the associated hox proteins as modulators of an ancestral skeletogenic system that only took on a specific digit-related role after the sarcopterygian two-galectin network was in place .

CONCLUSIONS
evolutionary changes in the gnathostome genes specifying the animal lectin gal- <dig> at the protein and noncoding dna levels, when analyzed in terms of an experimentally based mathematical model, suggest a phylogenetic route of emergence of a reaction-diffusion network capable of generating sarcopterygian-type limb skeletal patterns. in the context of the structural conservation of gal- <dig>  the skeletogenic component of the network, across the vertebrates, the structural and implied functional differences in gal- <dig>  the pattern regulatory component, among the cartilaginous, ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes/tetrapods, support a galectin-based evolutionary-developmental hypothesis for the fin-limb transition.
