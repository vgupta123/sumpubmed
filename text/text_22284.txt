BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant staphylococci represent a great challenge for treatment and public health. in staphylococci, methicillin resistance is mainly due to the expression of the meca gene, which specifies penicillin binding protein 2a , a transpeptidase with a low affinity for β-lactams  <cit> . meca is carried by a mobile genetic element  termed the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec   <cit> . generally, sccmec contains two essential components, i.e. the mec gene complex and the ccr gene complex. the mec gene complex consists of meca, the regulatory genes and associated insertion sequences and has been classified into six different classes, i.e. a, b, c <dig>  c <dig>  d and e. cassette chromosome recombinase  genes  encode recombinases mediating integration and excision of sccmec into and from the chromosome  <cit> . the ccr gene and surrounding genes form the ccr gene complex.

a staphylococcus haemolyticus clinical isolate, wch <dig>  was found carrying meca but no ccr genes. although clinical isolates of s. haemolyticus containing meca but lacking ccr genes have been reported previously  <cit> , information about the detailed contexts of meca is largely absent. the genetic context of meca in wch <dig> was therefore investigated using long-range pcr, pcr mapping, inverse pcr and sequencing as described previously  <cit> .

RESULTS
the minimum inhibitory concentration  of cefoxitin against wch <dig> was 128 μg/ml. a 40-kb region containing meca was obtained from wch <dig>  abutting orfx at one end and seven orfs designated orf <dig> to orf <dig> here , which were also present in the oric environ on the chromosome of the completely-sequenced s. haemolyticus strain jcsc <dig>   <cit> , at the other . the partial sequence of orfx obtained was 99% identical to that of s. haemolyticus jcsc <dig>  orf <dig> to orf <dig> were identical to the counterparts of s. haemolyticus jcsc <dig> and were not part of any known mobile genetic elements , confirming that these orfs indeed belonged to the core chromosome of s. haemolyticus.

meca is bracketed by two copies of is <dig> flanking by an 8-bp direct repeat sequence
wch <dig> had a class c <dig> mec gene complex composed of meca, mecr1Δ truncated by the insertion of the insertion sequence is <dig>  several other genes and another copy of is <dig> downstream of meca with the two copies of is <dig> at the same orientation . the class c <dig> mec gene complex is also present in sccmec types vii and x of staphylococcus aureus and several unnamed types of sccmec in coagulase-negative staphylococci   <cit> .

an 8-bp identical sequence  was identified flanking the two copies of is <dig>  the 8-bp dr was part of the spacer sequence between arsr  and copa . the presence of a direct repeat  suggested that the two copies of is <dig> might have formed a composite transposon with the potential to mediate the mobilization of meca into different genomic locations. this meca-carrying is431-formed composite transposon was designated tn <dig> according to the transposon database . composite transposons formed by is <dig> generating 8-bp at-rich dr on insertion have been seen before, such as tn <dig> carrying ccrc and the aminoglycoside resistance determinant aaca found in a st <dig> s. aureus <cit> . two copies of is <dig> have also been found to mediate the transposition of plasmids pub <dig> encoding bleomycin resistance  <cit>  and pt <dig> encoding tetracycline and mercury resistance  <cit> . however, tn <dig> and other is431-formed composite transposons do not contain meca. is <dig> is widely distributed in staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus   <cit>  and appears to play a vital role in generating mosaicism in the genetic contexts of meca. the insertion of is <dig> and homologous recombination between different copies of is <dig> can result in acquisition, loss and re-arrangements of genetic components  <cit> . therefore, is <dig> apparently serves as the “adapters” allowing genetic components to be linked and clustered together to form complicated genetic contexts of meca.

in genbank and literature, e.g.  <cit> , there are many cases in which meca is bracketed by two copies of is <dig>  either at the same or opposite orientations, i.e. the class c <dig> or c <dig> mec complex. in these cases, two copies of is <dig> have the potential to form a composite transposon mediating the mobilization of meca but no 8-bp dr could be identified flanking the class c <dig> or c <dig> mec complexes. this suggests that the two copies of is <dig> might have inserted in tandem rather than mobilize together as a unit. alternatively, is <dig> might behave likes is <dig> <cit> , an insertion sequence also of the is <dig> family, that could lead to adjacent deletions, leaving no dr.

no ccr genes could be identified in this large region containing meca. in the 1970s and 1980s, it was found that methicillin resistance could be transferred by phages  <cit>  in experimental conditions and could be also carried by a transposon, tn <dig>  located on a naturally occurring plasmid, pi <dig>  <cit> . however, these studies were carried out before the identification of meca and no sequence information was available for the phages carrying methicillin resistance, tn <dig> and pi <dig>  it remains unclear whether methicillin resistance in these experiments was due to the expression of meca. in particular, tn <dig> mediated resistance to methicillin but not to penicillin, raising the possibility that the methicillin resistance determinant carried by tn <dig> was actually not meca. meca is usually transferred by sccmec, but meca existed in the absence of any known types of ccr genes have been found in both mrsa and cons previously. in particular, no known ccr genes were detected for an half of methicillin-resistant s. haemolyticus isolates from a hospital in tunisia  <cit> , suggesting that elements carrying meca but lacking ccr genes might be common in s. haemolyticus. however, the detailed genetic context of meca were not characterized in these cases and therefore the exact reasons for the absence of ccr genes remain unclear  <cit> . the present study provides a detailed example that meca was in a context without ccr genes and might be able to be transferred by a mge other than sccmec.

a complex scc-like remnant containing components with various origins
this 40-kb region between orfx and orf <dig> contained five copies of is <dig>  and three terminal inverted repeats  of scc elements . an ir was in the orfx, designated ir <dig> here. the second ir another was located between the lipoprotein-encoding gene, lip, and a putative acyl-coa acyltransferase-encoding gene, acf, designated ir <dig> here. the third ir was adjacent to orf <dig>  part of the core chromosome of s. haemolyticus, designated ir <dig> here . this 40-kb region was actually bracketed by two ir, ir <dig> and ir <dig>  resembling the remnant of a scc-like element but without ccr genes. in light of the presence of an internal ir, ir <dig>  this ccr-absent large region was a remnant of a composite scc element or comprised remnants of multiple scc elements.

the  <dig> -kb region between orfx and the is431- <dig> was designated r <dig>  and contained genes encoding adp-ribosylglycohydrolase, permease and ribokinase. r <dig> was almost identical to the counterpart  of the integrative plasmid vse <dig> on the chromosome of s. epidermidis rp62a  but was absent from s. haemolyticus jcsc <dig>  suggesting a foreign origin. of note, the ribokinase-encoding gene, rbk, was truncated at the 3′ end by the insertion of is <dig>  leaving a 920 bp remnant of the 939 bp gene.

the region between the is431- <dig> and ir <dig> was designated r <dig>  as mentioned above, tn <dig> was inserted into the spacer between arsr and copa in r <dig>  besides tn <dig>  r <dig> also contained a few genes, the cadxd operon mediating resistance to cadmium and the ars operon required for detoxifying arsenate. in r <dig>  the sequence from the is431- <dig> to arsb was closest  to the counterpart in the type ix sccmec of s. aureus strain jcsc <dig> , while that from arsb to ir <dig> excluding tn <dig> was almost identical to the corresponding region in the type x sccmec of s. aureus jcsc <dig> . this suggests that r <dig> might have resulted from homologous recombination between the ars operons of the type ix and x sccmec. r <dig> and r <dig> had different origins and were separated by a single copy of is <dig>  suggesting that is <dig> served as a joining point that brought the two regions together.

the large region between ir <dig> and ir <dig> was designated r <dig>  the two genes, acf and orf <dig> , adjacent to ir <dig> had  <dig> % identities to the counterparts of a scc element on the chromosome of s. haemolyticus jcsc <dig>  at the other end of r <dig>  there was a second copy of the ars operon, which was closest to those on a few s. aureus plasmids, e.g. pi <dig>  and pk <dig>  with  <dig> % identity and had only  <dig> % identity with the first ars operon in r <dig> of wch <dig>  the intervening genetic components in r <dig> had lower than 80% identity with the closest matches identified by blast and were absent from the chromosome of s. haemolyticus jcsc <dig>  all above findings suggest that all genetic components in r <dig> had origins other than s. haemolyticus. of note, there were two copies of is <dig> and an issha <dig> in r <dig> but no dr could be identified, suggesting that these mge were likely to have resulted from homologous recombination rather than direct insertion.

of note, r <dig> contained several possible virulence factors. a putative proline permease-encoding putp gene was present on r <dig> and had 78% identity with that of staphylococcus saprophyticus strain atcc  <dig>  <cit> . putp has been identified as a virulence factor in s. aureus, contributing to invasive infection  <cit> . r <dig> also contained a feob-like gene that was 68% identical to the counterpart of staphylococcus carnosus strain tm <dig> . feob has been known as a virulence factor in gram-negative bacteria, while its virulence status in gram-positive remains controversial since it has been found conferring virulence in streptococcus suis <cit>  but not in listeria monocytogenesis <cit>  and there is no study of feob for staphylococci. in addition, orf <dig> encodes a putative abc-type bacteriocin transporter, which might involve in the regulation of virulence factor expression.

in addition, a number of genes encoding products for metabolism, transporting nutrients or detoxifying harmful substances were present in this large region carrying meca . the presence of these features could enhance the adaptation of the host strain to variable environment and therefore provided advantages in fitness. of note, it has been reported that staphylococci are resistant to chromates  <cit> . a putative chromate transporter gene mediating resistance to chromates was found but with no significant matches in staphylococci. to our knowledge, it is the first time to identify a chromate transporter gene in staphylococci. it also suggests that additional mechanisms are responsible for the chromate resistance in staphylococci.

although the genetic context of meca was characterized in detail, the exact reason for the absence of ccr genes in wch <dig> remains undetermined. it is possible that meca was originally carried by a sccmec element with ccr genes and the subsequent insertion of an additional is <dig> upstream of meca could give rise to the potential composite transposon, tn <dig>  together with the already-existed is <dig> downstream of meca. tn <dig> might have mobilized meca into a new genomic location or alternatively, ccr genes could have been deleted due to homologous recombination between multiple copies of is <dig> that were present in wch <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
meca was identified in a 40-kb region that contained ir of scc elements but no ccr genes. this large region was very complex in structure and contained multiple genetic components with different origins. genetic components with various origins were likely introduced in tandem by scc elements and insertion sequences through insertion and homologous recombination. two copies of is <dig> bracketed meca and were flanked the characteristic 8-bp direct repeat sequence, suggesting that the two is <dig> might have form a composite transposon with the potential to be active. the is431-formed composite transposon might represent a new mechanism for the mobilization of meca independent of the action of sccmec. the present study aimed to illustrating the complex context of meca but further experiments to demonstrate the activity of tn <dig> in transposing meca are warranted to confirm the proposed new mechanisms for the mobilization of meca.
