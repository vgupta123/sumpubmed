BACKGROUND
sensory hair cells are the highly specialized mechanoreceptors of the auditory, vestibular, and lateral line  organs in vertebrates. due to their mechanical sensitivity, relative scarcity, and the complex anatomy of the acoustico-lateralis organs, hair cells have been a difficult cell type to dissociate, purify and analyze. uncovering new hair cell-enriched transcripts would complement the genetic approaches that have identified many, but not all, of the genes required for the function of hair cells. the zebrafish is an excellent genetic model for hearing and balance  <cit> , however, only one study has attempted to experimentally define the zebrafish hair-cell transcriptome using dissociated macular cells from adults  <cit> . as such, larval zebrafish hair-cell gene expression remains poorly characterized. uncovering additional hair cell-specific transcripts would both increase the usefulness of zebrafish as a model for hearing and balance disorders, and deepen our understanding of the development and function of vertebrate hair cells.

previous transcriptional profiling studies of hair cells have used either manual cell sorting or fluorescence-activated cell sorting  to enrich for mammalian auditory and vestibular hair cells, as well as regenerating hair cells in the zebrafish lateral-line organ . although successful at enriching for rare cell types, the drawback of invasive cell-purification techniques is that they require extensive tissue manipulation that may disrupt endogenous patterns of gene expression. furthermore, cell sorting captures the entire transcriptome of a cell, and does not discriminate between preexisting rna and newly synthesized transcripts. for these two reasons, facs may not be the best choice for analyzing dynamic changes in gene expression. to enrich for cell-type specific rna from an intact organism, a number of innovative techniques have been developed, including intact nuclei purification , translating ribosome affinity purification  , and thiouracil  rna tagging  <cit> . to further our understanding of the biology of zebrafish hair cells, and to develop an alternative to invasive cell-purification techniques, in this study we describe the use of tu-tagging in zebrafish to label hair cell-expressed transcripts in vivo.

tu-tagging is a method to enrich for actively transcribed rna from a specific cell type of interest. this is achieved through the cell type-restricted expression of the toxoplasma gondii uracil phospho-ribosyltransferase  enzyme together with the global application of its substrate, 4-thiouracil . uprt-positive cells will preferentially convert 4tu to 4-thiouridine monophosphate, a thiol-substituted form of uridine that can be readily incorporated into nascent rna. by taking advantage of the fact that thiol  groups do not normally exist in ribonucleic acids, thiol-tagged rna from rare or difficult to isolate cell types  can be biotinylated in vitro and selectively purified from the greater rna pool  <cit> . moreover, because rna is labeled in the live, intact organism, tu-tagging alleviates concerns about disrupting endogenous patterns of gene expression by invasive cell isolation techniques. we have created a transgenic line of fish that expresses an ha-epitope tagged uprt enzyme and a red fluorescent protein ) under the control of the myosin 6b minimal promoter to restrict uprt expression to the zebrafish auditory, vestibular and lateral-line hair cells. tu-tagged and input rna samples were subjected to rna sequencing and transcript abundance was analyzed by deseq to identify putative hair cell-expressed transcripts. in all, we found  <dig> significantly enriched transcripts , only seven of which were known to be expressed in zebrafish hair cells. using whole mount mrna in situ hybridization, we confirmed the hair cell-restricted expression of an additional  <dig> genes whose spatial expression pattern had not been previously described in zebrafish. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of tu-tagging in zebrafish, and suggests that this technique may be useful in other zebrafish cell types.

RESULTS
generation and characterization of tg transgenic fish
using the tol2/gateway system  <cit>  we created transgenic zebrafish that expressed an ha-epitope tagged version of the toxoplasma gondii uprt enzyme in auditory, vestibular, and lateral line hair cells under control of the myosin 6b promoter . additionally, we used a p2a-mcherry marker to visually score for transgenesis. we selected a line of tg ) fish that exhibited bright, hair cell-restricted mcherry fluorescence, and confirmed uprt expression by co-staining for the ha tag at  <dig> dpf .fig.  <dig> uprt expression and activity in zebrafish hair cells. a diagram of the construct used for tol <dig> gateway-mediated transgenesis. a minimal myo6b promoter was used to drive expression of the ha-uprt-p2a-mcherry transgene in auditory, vestibular, and lateral line hair cells. b-b” maximum projection images of immunolabeled ha-uprt and fixed mcherry fluoresecence in inner ear hair cells of a  <dig> dpf tg larva. ac, anterior crista; am, anterior macula; lc, lateral crista; pc, posterior crista. the focal plane includes a neuromast . c dot blot for tu-tagged, biotinylated total rna demonstrating the enzymatic activity of uprt in the hair cells of  <dig> dpf zebrafish larvae. nontransgenic wild-type  larvae exhibited low levels of 4tu incorporation in contrast to tg larvae when exposed to 5 mm 4tu for 3 h. rna from tg larvae exposed to dmso only did not exhibit any detectable biotinylation



functionality of the t.gondii uprt enzyme has not been previously demonstrated in zebrafish. to test if uprt activity in zebrafish hair cells enhanced 4-thiouracil incorporation into nascent rna, we treated 5  dpf wild type and tg larvae with either 1 % dmso or 5 mm 4tu/1 % dmso for 3 h. total rna was isolated, biotinylated in vitro, and dotted onto a membrane. tu-tagged, biotinylated rna was detected with streptavidin-hrp . wild type larvae exposed to 4tu did show some uprt-independent labeling. however, the level of 4tu incorporation was greatly enhanced in tg larvae. rna from tg larvae exposed to dmso alone did not exhibit any detectable biotinylation. these dot blot results indicate that uprt is functional when expressed in zebrafish hair cells.

tu-tagging enriches for hair cell-expressed transcripts
to label and purify hair cell mrna from zebrafish, we adapted the general strategy outlined in gay et al. . we treated  <dig> dpf wild type and tg larvae with  <dig>  mm 4tu/1 % dmso for 15 h at 29 °c. following total rna extraction and poly mrna enrichment, the mrna was fragmented, biotinylated, and tu-tagged fragments were isolated using streptavidin-mediated pulldown. barcoded illumina rna seq libraries were prepared from the following four sources and sequenced on one lane of a hiseq  <dig> sequencer:  <cit>  tg input  rna,  <cit>  tg tu-tagged  rna,  <cit>  wild-type  input rna, and  <cit>  wild-type tu-tagged rna. for each of the experimental groups, we mapped the sequencing reads to the zv <dig> zebrafish genome using tophat <dig>  <cit>  and counted the number of reads aligning with each annotated gene region using seqmonk  <cit> . read counts were imported to deseq  <cit>  to determine statistically significant differences in transcript abundance between the input and tu-tagged samples derived from both tg and wild-type control larvae.fig.  <dig> tu-tagging workflow diagram. larvae  were exposed to  <dig>  mm 4tu for 15 h and then homogenized to isolate total rna. purified poly  mrna was then fragmented and biotinylated for strepavidin-mediated pull down. rnaseq libraries were constructed and sequenced for comparison of transcript abundance between tu-tagged and input control rna



our statistical analysis revealed  <dig> transcripts that were significantly enriched  greater than 2-fold in the tg tu-tagged sample relative to the input . we filtered this list further by excluding four transcripts  that were enriched >2-fold in the wild-type tu-tagged sample relative to the corresponding wild-type input , as the enrichment of these transcripts in non tg larvae was not related to hair cell-specific expression. as a result, we found  <dig> transcripts whose abundance was significantly enriched in the tu-tagged rna sample .fig.  <dig> enriched nascent transcripts in larval hair cells. seqmonk scatter plot showing the correlation between the log2-transformed reads-per-million mapped reads  values for each zebrafish gene from the tu-tagged and input mrna samples. the  <dig> significantly enriched tu-tagged genes  are indicated by the red points to the upper left of the diagonal. the top ten significantly enriched genes are annotated by name, with previously known zebrafish hair cell transcripts underlined

using whole mount in situ hybridization to characterize the spatial expression of tu-tagged transcripts in zebrafish
of the  <dig> significantly enriched tu-tagged transcripts, the spatial expression pattern of  <dig> genes has not been reported in zebrafish. to directly test if these genes are expressed in zebrafish hair cells at  <dig> dpf, we performed in situ hybridization  for those  <dig> genes that had clearly identifiable mammalian homologs. in total, we were able to confirm hair cell-restricted expression for  <dig> of these  <dig> tu-enriched transcripts . we found that one of the previously uncharacterized genes – a zebrafish ortholog of gpr <dig> – was expressed in taste buds, and not in hair cells . control sense probes for anxa5a, cd164l <dig>  otofb, strc, and tekt <dig> did not yield specific signals in hair cells . considering both the previously reported expression patterns and the  <dig> new patterns described here, these tu-enriched genes were primarily if not exclusively expressed in hair cells. most genes  were detected in both ear and lateral-line hair cells, while four genes were primarily expressed in the ear , and the expression of two genes were detected in the lateral line organ only . these ish results confirm that our tu-tagging experiment successfully enriched for auditory, vestibular, and lateral line hair-cell transcripts.fig.  <dig> validation of hair-cell specific gene expression by whole mount mrna in situ hybridization. panels a-q show the mrna in situ hybridization patterns for  <dig> of the uncharacterized tu-enriched genes. lateral views  of the head and anterior trunk of  <dig> dpf larvae are depicted. in each panel, the focal plane includes sensory epithelia of the inner ear and neuromasts , as indicated in panel a.  the deseq adjusted p-value  and fold-enrichment of the transcript in the tu-tagged mrna sample are indicated for each gene. scale bar in a = 100 μm



discussion
our results demonstrate that tu-tagging is a viable, noninvasive method for identification of cell type-specific mrna in zebrafish. specifically, we employed this profiling technique to identify genes that are selectively expressed during development in sensory hair cells. by adapting the method of tu labeling of transcripts to a larval stage  in zebrafish, we found  <dig> transcripts that were significantly enriched in the tu-tagged mrna sample of newly developed hair cells compared to the untagged input mrna at the same developmental stage. using in situ hybridization, we confirmed the specific expression pattern of  <dig> genes in hair cells that have not been previously described in zebrafish. our work has substantially added to the number of confirmed hair cell-enriched transcripts in zebrafish and serves as an example of how tu-tagging can be used for characterization of newly synthesized transcripts in a rare cell type.

our tu-tagging experiment sought to purify transcripts from auditory, vestibular and lateral-line hair cells from whole larvae without any prior tissue enrichment. we estimate that hair cells represent <1 % of the total cell number in a  <dig> dpf zebrafish larva . in addition to being scarce, zebrafish hair cells are clustered at different locations within the otic vesicle or distributed in neuromasts at the surface of the skin, making the enrichment of hair cell transcripts a demanding test for tu-tagging. ideally, any rna-enrichment experiment would identify hair cell-expressed transcripts with high specificity and high sensitivity; that is, identify only hair cell transcripts and detect even the rarest ones, regardless of whether they were also expressed in other cell types. given our experimental design, we found that tu-tagging enriched for hair cell transcripts with good specificity, but poor sensitivity. this means that the majority of our significantly enriched transcripts are bona fide hair cell-expressed genes. however, the experiment was not sensitive enough to identify anything other than hair cell-specific transcripts. the in situ hybridization experiments confirm the limitations on sensitivity; all of the significantly enriched tu-tagged transcripts were exclusive to hair cells. our experiment did not identify known hair cell-expressed transcripts that are also robustly expressed in other tissues, such as the deafness genes pcdh15a, cacnad1a, or cdh <dig> . while our tu-tagging experiment successfully identified novel hair cell-specific transcripts in zebrafish, as performed, it was not an effective tool for analyzing the entire hair-cell transcriptome.

to improve the sensitivity of tu-tagging in zebrafish, manual tissue enrichment prior to rna isolation is an option. this approach, similar to that taken in mice by gay et al.  <cit> , is more cumbersome in zebrafish due to the large number of small larvae required for the experiment. an alternative is to use adult tissues if the developmental stage is not an issue. other possible changes to the experimental protocol could include shortening the duration and concentration of 4tu exposure, as this may reduce uprt-independent labeling in non-target cell types. furthermore, performing the experiment with discrete biological replicates will increase the statistical power during data analysis and may increase the sensitivity of transcript detection. however, due to the uprt-independent thiol-labeling we observed, it is likely that tu-tagging of rare cell types will always have a signal-to-noise problem to some extent.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the limitations on sensitivity, in our hands the tu-tagging method was robust using undissected larvae, revealing  <dig> hitherto unknown cell type-specific transcripts in developing zebrafish hair cells. in the context of the whole larva, acousticolateralis hair cells are a relatively rare cell type, thus this approach is likely to be useful for analyzing gene expression in other tissues or specific types of cells as well. the major appeal of tu-tagging is the ability to spatially control the expression of uprt and temporally control the exposure to 4tu. the ability of tu-tagging to discriminate between newly synthesized and pre-existing transcripts will enhance future studies of changes in gene expression during dynamic processes such as development or synaptic plasticity.
