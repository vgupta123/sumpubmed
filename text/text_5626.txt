BACKGROUND
germination is a phenomenon with complex regulation that is a balance between the release of dormancy and the promotion of germination. this reflects the relationship between the hormones gibberellic acid  and abscisic acid , environmental cues  <cit> , and the spatial distribution of hormone action and gene expression  <cit> . considerable effort has been put into elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling seed germination with greater application of gene expression profiling. these studies have highlighted the roles of gene expression changes in mediating ga and aba interactions in the control of dormancy and germination  <cit> . to complement the growing number of gene expression studies, fait et al.  <cit>  conducted an integrated metabolomic and gene expression study of various seed developmental stages from maturation through germination. they identified distinct metabolite profiles associated with the various developmental stages and suggested that seeds are metabolically primed for germination during desiccation and subsequent metabolic programming during imbibition and germination is essential for seedling establishment. an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic study of photomorphogenesis in red light and far-red light treated seedlings showed that even though transcript profiles were relatively similar, phenotypic differences could be explained by significant differences at the level of the metabolome  <cit> .

prior to seed germination, the mobilization of stored triacylglycerol  begins in earnest in order to feed the developing seedling. the processes by which germination and lipid mobilization are regulated have been found to be distinct  <cit> , and it is likely that reserve mobilization is governed by abscisic acid-related processes within the embryo  <cit> . in arabidopsis, stored sugars are consumed by the time the radicle has emerged, and within  <dig> h after germination lipid and protein stores have been consumed  <cit> . at this point, the seedling must become photosynthetically competent. it has been suggested that metabolic signals may regulate the transition from heterotrophy to autotrophy in seedlings in order to maximize the use of storage compounds  <cit> . exploiting the altered behavior of seed germination and of seedling vigor for forward genetic screens of arabidopsis mutants has been instrumental in revealing the potential signaling properties of metabolites, primarily sugars  <cit> , and nutrients  <cit> . mutant studies have revealed the interaction of sugars and hormones  <cit>  and the concept of a carbon:nitrogen 'matrix effect' in metabolic regulation  <cit> . through a forward genetic screen using the toxic analogue monofluoroacetic acid, we identified mutants disrupted in their ability to metabolize exogenously supplied acetate through the glyoxylate cycle  <cit> . a physiological analysis of the mutants provided evidence that carbohydrate responses of seedlings may be impaired within the mutants. this suggests a cross-talk between organic acid and carbohydrate signaling in developing seedlings  <cit>  with the possibility of either acetate or down-stream metabolites influencing gene expression in developing seedlings.

many forward genetic screens have relied on observing differential sensitivity of mutants to added compounds. this approach does not work for many metabolites, since artificially high concentrations must be used and undesired traits are selected. for example, organic acids pose this problem because they are weak acids, and mutant selection for specific responses may be confounded by responses to altered intracellular ph. integrated analysis of metabolite and transcript data offers a way to identify co-regulatory networks of metabolites and genes  <cit> . this has been applied successfully to identify potential genetic regulation of metabolite levels concerning sulfur stress  <cit> , glucosinolate metabolism  <cit> , and nitrogen responses  <cit>  in arabidopsis and fruit development in tomato  <cit> . the suggestion that strong correlations between metabolites and transcripts may reflect metabolite effects on gene expression  <cit> , therefore, enables integrated analysis to be used to identify potential signaling metabolites for subsequent detailed studies. we obtained metabolite and transcript profiling data from a series of samples spanning germination and establishment, and analyzed the data to identify pair-wise combinations of genes and metabolites strongly correlated over this developmental transition. we discuss how analysis of metabolite-gene correlations provided evidence for differential regulation of a common ontological class of genes. furthermore, the network correlation analysis approach can provide supplemental information on the progression of metabolic and transcriptional states during developmental transitions  <cit> . both types of profiling data were mined for interesting gene expression and metabolite patterns and relationships. principle component analysis  and network correlation analysis based on spring-embedding  <cit>  were used to integrate and visualize the data to obtain information about the metabolic and transitional states present during germination and seedling development.

RESULTS
gene expression during seedling development
the combined use of a threshold cut-off value of  <dig> -fold and 99% confidence limits for statistical significance produced  <dig>  differentially-expressed  genes in total, both up- and down-regulated  over the eight pairwise comparisons . this total number of de events is similar to those reported in analogous studies. for example, over  <dig> stages of development of tomato exposed to ethylene, alba et al.  <cit>  estimated that almost  <dig>  de events would have occurred. they concluded that this was a large underestimate for the fruit as a whole, since only the pericarp was analyzed. between days  <dig> and  <dig> and days  <dig> and  <dig> there appear to be an equivalent total number of de genes divided equally between those ur and dr. between days  <dig> and  <dig>  there is an increase in de genes of about 25%. notably, dr genes comprised more than 80% of the de genes between these days. there was a 2-fold decrease in total de genes between days  <dig> and  <dig>  which was a majority of dr genes. the number of de genes begins to increase in later days, but with ur becoming more predominant at alternate stages. this was most apparent comparing days  <dig> and  <dig> and days  <dig> and  <dig>  using the ontological assignments available at tair, we looked more closely at two different classes of genes, nuclear genes encoding chloroplast and plastid proteins and those encoding transcription factors  and signaling genes . the former would indicate changes to the autotrophic state, whereas the latter would reflect overall regulatory activity. in general, the expression profiles of these classes of genes were similar, which is not unexpected with the requirement for transcriptional control of photosynthetic development. the differences in the number of de genes observed between the two classes preceded emergence, which occurred from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  from day  <dig> to day  <dig> other ontological classes associated with regulatory processes, such as nucleic acid binding or kinase activity were proportionately higher among dr genes compared to ur genes . there was substantial ur of both tf/signaling and chloroplast/plastid gene expression at days  <dig> and  <dig> when compared with the previous day. the proportions of each ontological class among both ur and dr genes were similar at day  <dig> compared with day  <dig>  with only cell wall-classified genes showing a relative higher proportion the ur category . this was also the case for day  <dig> compared with day  <dig> with only the receptor binding class appearing substantially dr . these are processes that are occurring primarily in cotyledons and the hypocotyl leading to leaf growth, since true leaves do not make up a substantial proportion of seedling mass until about day  <dig>  <cit> .

behavior of metabolites during development
a total of  <dig> metabolites corresponding to a variety of known and unknown metabolites including four soluble carbohydrates, nine amino acids and five organic acids were quantified from the 1h-nmr spectra of seedling extracts. although these metabolites comprise a small proportion of the total metabolic complement of a cell, these metabolites are the most abundant ones. they reflect the nutritional state of the tissue as an immediate source of carbon and/or nitrogen and serve as respiratory substrates for energy production. a direct comparison of data from our nmr profiling platform with gc-ms acquired data demonstrated a similar capacity to distinguish metabolic states  <cit> . additionally, a number of the metabolites are well known effectors of gene expression and some, such as sucrose, isoleucine and glutamine, have high regulatory potential as determined by correlation analysis  <cit> . the values obtained for each metabolite are given in additional file  <dig> 

in order to understand better the general trends in metabolite behavior over the developmental series we produced two-dimensional self organising maps  that grouped like-varying metabolites . a number of metabolites decreased throughout the developmental period shown in cluster  <dig>  as expected, this cluster included sucrose  <cit> , which is known to decrease upon the initiation of germination. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contain metabolites that fluctuate with no particular trend or increase slightly during development. clusters 4- <dig> contain  <dig> metabolites that show a biphasic profile of increasing then decreasing levels. malate  shows a relatively sharp increase and decrease compared to valine, leucine and isoleucine  although each attains a maximum level on the same day. cluster  <dig> shows  <dig> metabolites, glutamine, fructose and an unknown compound that attain maximum levels about a day later. we are particularly interested in metabolites that changed over the course of development , since they would be candidates for metabolic control factors.

the relationships between individual metabolites are clearer when correlations are included in the visualization as shown in the spring embedding plots . our threshold p-value produced a correlation coefficient cut-off value of  <dig> . we observed significant correlations between  <dig> metabolites that appear to be separated into three clusters. the cluster containing glutamine, fructose, fumarate and unkd <dig>  are linked to the lactate cluster  via sucrose. the lactate cluster contains those metabolites that are decreasing over time, such as trigonelline, threonine, citrate, and alanine . malate has also been included within this cluster and has a relatively high correlation to alanine. this could reflect a partitioning of malate into alanine either via oxaloacetate or pyruvate. the third cluster  consists of the aliphatic amino acids and the compounds choline, and formate. it was expected that the three amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine would be highly correlated as they share common synthetic and catabolic pathways.

transcriptional states of developing seedlings
in order for us to compare transcriptional states among days, only genes that were expressed at each of the  <dig> sampling points were included. however, in order to maximize the number of genes in the analysis only one expression value per time point was required. this filtering process resulted in a final set of  <dig>  genes . initially, a principal component analysis  scores plot was produced in order to investigate the relationships among days according to gene expression profiles . this revealed a general progression of time points across pc <dig> with the transition from day  <dig> to  <dig> and from day  <dig> to  <dig> contributing mostly to pc <dig>  days  <dig> to  <dig> appear to form a loose cluster, which would be expected if the expression of photosynthetic genes has begun in earnest by day  <dig>  which agrees with the gene expression profiling data . the pca scores plot for individual sample is given in additional file  <dig>  the loadings analysis indicated that the most variant genes were chlorophyll a/b binding proteins and small subunits of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase . it is also evident that pc <dig> comprises some technical variation due to differences in slide hybridization since the apparent outliers do not correspond to any one particular sampling set. spring embedding was used to investigate further the relationships between time points in the dataset of transcript profiles  <cit> . the spring embedding algorithm is non-linear, and so is able to amplify any clustering in the data to make it more visually clear compared to standard pca analysis. due to the size of the data set and the possible number of correlations that can be obtained, the cut-off threshold was set to  <dig> . the spring embedding was clearer in showing the division of tissue samples into two clusters comprising days 0- <dig> and days 3- <dig> . when the threshold was dropped to  <dig>  the connections between day  <dig> and the later days became more apparent and the spring embedding plot began to mimic the pca plot with day  <dig> moving from day  <dig> and lying more closely to days  <dig> to  <dig> than to day  <dig> 

metabolic states of developing seedlings
a pca scores plot of time points based on metabolite profiles revealed a curvature in the points . variation among days  <dig> and  <dig> was shown almost exclusively in pc <dig> and subsequent differences to day  <dig> were shown in gradual shifts in both pc <dig> and pc <dig>  the pca scores plot for individual samples is given in additional file  <dig>  the loading plots confirmed our conclusions from the visual inspection of the data in that the major differences between days  <dig> and  <dig> were the levels of metabolites that decreased substantially, such as sucrose, glucose and unkm <dig>  . the clustering in the pca loadings plot mirrored that of the spring embedding plot for the metabolites alone  and suggested a steady transition in states from day  <dig> to later days. spring embedding was used to clarify the relationships among the days, based on the metabolite data . at a threshold correlation value of  <dig>  two clusters became apparent. there was a relatively high correlation between day  <dig> and day  <dig> and among days 2- <dig>  with a lower correlation between day  <dig> and day  <dig>  as the threshold correlation is decreased the groups move closer together, but the clustering was not lost until a correlation cut-off below  <dig>  was used. if the threshold cut-off is increased to  <dig> , then the link between day  <dig> and day  <dig> is severed. the apparent separation of day  <dig> from day  <dig> is due mainly to the second replicate sample of day  <dig> . the other two day  <dig> samples clustered very closely to the three day  <dig> samples and all the samples from day  <dig> to day  <dig> showed a strong correlation. in order to identify the metabolites with a significant difference in measured levels between days  <dig> and  <dig>  which are the developmental stages that mark the division of the two clusters, we applied a student s t-test to the data . a significant difference was observed for the levels of several metabolites . we can only speculate that relatively high sucrose, rhamnose, lactate, citrate, alanine, trigonelline and unkm <dig> , and relatively low fructose, glutamine and unkd <dig>  comprise part a metabolic state that is conducive for germination, and that change in these metabolites promotes emergence and establishment. less abundant metabolites that were not quantifiable by nmr also will be very important in defining metabolic states.

metabolite and transcript co-analysis
the majority of the metabolites measured demonstrated altered levels throughout the time course allowing correlations to be identified with gene transcript levels. spring embedding was used to visualize relationships between genes and metabolites based on significant correlations over all the sampling points . using a false discovery rate   <cit>  of 10% to generate the threshold p-value , a total of  <dig> pair-wise correlations were identified among  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> genes . we emphasize that the bonferroni and benjamini and hochberg fdr adjustments that were used to establish thresholds of significance are very stringent. nevertheless, in order to check our use of a fdr threshold, the time point labels of the gene and metabolite data were randomly permuted  <dig> times and each time the cross-correlations were calculated using the same threshold level of significance across the  <dig> permutations, the median number of significant correlations was  <dig>  this corresponds to 11% of the  <dig> seen in the non-permuted data and is close to the desired fdr of 10%.

the metabolites are presented as nodes to which the correlated genes radiate outwards. as expected, both positive and negative correlations were identified. table  <dig> lists the metabolites identified as showing a correlation with one or more genes along with the nature of the correlation. the metabolite profile is described as increasing, decreasing, or as biphasic throughout the developmental series. the gene ontology from the tair database was used to identify the function for each gene listed. of the  <dig> correlated genes, 19% were identified in the tair database as encoding an "expressed" or a "hypothetical" protein. of the remaining  <dig> correlations, 25% of the genes were associated with a known regulatory aspect of plant development, for example, phytohormone or light response, or had previously been identified as demonstrating seed-specific expression. a further 12% of the genes with an assigned identity in the tair database were involved with signal transduction. sixty-one percent of the genes  showed significant correlation with sucrose. all sucrose-gene correlations were positive, since the fdr only gave the most significant correlations, which were independent of sign. most of the regulatory/signal transduction genes correlated with sucrose indicating that they decrease rapidly upon transfer of seeds to germination conditions. these included the transcription factors phytochrome interacting factor  <dig> , abscisic acid insensitive  <dig> , and atmyb <dig> , and the light-receptor/kinase genes phya and phyd . correlations with other metabolites revealed progressive changes in the transcript level of other transcription factors that might interact, such as auxin response factor  <dig>  and abi <dig>  <cit>  and the aux/iaa protein family tf solitary-root /iaa <dig>  as abi <dig> drops immediately following transfer to growth conditions, arf <dig> remains constant and does not drop until after germination, and iaa <dig> is present in imbibed seeds and then increases prior to germination .

an example of the relationships between a metabolite and a connected gene is given for lactate . lactate was negatively correlated with  <dig> genes, five of which had no assigned identity in the tair database. of the  <dig> genes with an assigned identity, seven showed an involvement in photosynthetic-related functions. eight of the genes within the group are also affected by abiotic or biotic stress. these include 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidate , calmodulin-like  <dig>  and the pip2a aquaporin , which is induced during dehydration stress. due to our stringent statistical cut-off, none of the  <dig> genes of the lactate cluster include any of the  <dig> hypoxia inducible genes reported by loreti  <cit> . however, the genes encoding alanine aminotransferase , alcohol dehydrogenase , class i non-symbiotic hemoglobin , and pyruvate decarboxylase  <dig>  reported as anoxia inducible by sachs et al.  <cit>  - and which are included in the set of  <dig> inducible genes - were positively correlated with lactate at a p-value less than  <dig>  . although a number of gene expression profiles were correlated with more than one metabolite concentration, it was observed that of the seven photosynthetic genes correlated to lactate, only three showed correlations with other metabolites. besides the two tfs shown in table  <dig>  the unknown metabolite unkm <dig>  was negatively correlated with  <dig> other genes, seven of which were assigned photosynthetic functions.

discussion
more and more, integrative approaches are being employed to describe the function of molecular systems in development  at this time, since they are geared for a constant rate of lipid degradation  <cit> , and cell expansion is the principal means of seedling growth  <cit> . subsequently, relative gene ur and dr appears to follow a cyclic pattern during the subsequent days, and it is interesting that this corresponds to likely transitional stages of development. transcriptional transition is lowest between days  <dig> and day  <dig>  since tf gene expression is dr. by day  <dig>  all lipid reserves have been depleted and so by day  <dig> any potential catabolite repression would be eliminated to permit full development of autotrophy, which would be revealed by a relative increase in ur genes, such as those encoding chloroplast/photosynthetic proteins. between days  <dig> and  <dig> rapid leaf growth begins  <cit>  and a corresponding ur of gene expression may ensue. accordingly, spikes of chloroplast/plastid and tf/signaling ur take place at days  <dig> and  <dig> 

metabolic state establishes prior to germination and the switch in transcriptional programming
the changes to levels of various metabolites going from imbibition to early germination follow similar patterns as reported previously  <cit> . fait et al.  <cit>  observed a change of metabolic activity during post-imbibition germination  <dig> h after transfer of seedlings from cold to a germination inductive temperature. the grouping of the metabolite profiles produced during this experiment supports these findings, demonstrating that in the cold, a relatively stable metabolic state for the major metabolites is present and then changes relatively little for  <dig> h. a larger metabolic switch occurs from day  <dig> to day  <dig> but the metabolic state stabilizes during seedling establishment even though a number of metabolites show transient increases .

although gene expression profiles are changing from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  there is a more dramatic change from day  <dig> to day  <dig> . by this point, the seedling has emerged, but attainment of full photosynthetic competence does not appear to happen quickly. from the large dr of expression from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  it is interesting to speculate that prior to the emergence of the radicle, i.e. by day  <dig>  the embryo has attained a metabolic state that primes the seedling to reduce aspects of gene expression in preference for emergence and reserve mobilization.

revealing potential metabolic signals by correlation analysis
deciphering metabolic contributions to switches in transcriptional states, such as observed during seedling development, will entail identifying individual signaling metabolites, the genes they affect and the concerted degree of affect  <cit> . although any metabolic regulation during the heterotrophic to autotrophic transition would be complex, it should be possible to identify metabolites involved in signaling gene expression events by examining their behavior in relation to the expression of specific genes  <cit> . we determined linear correlations between each metabolite-gene pair with the assumption that the strength of correlation would indicate the potential for a regulatory relationship to exist . sucrose levels showed positive correlations with  <dig> gene transcripts. comparison of the gene transcripts correlated with sucrose levels with previous microarray experiments and online databases showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes had previously been identified as sucrose-responsive  <cit> . the correlation of sucrose levels with a large proportion of previously identified sucrose-responsive gene transcripts reinforces the validity of the use of correlation coefficients to identify interesting relationships. two well-studied tfs that were highly correlated with sucrose were pif <dig> and abi <dig>  pif <dig> has been identified as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in seedlings  <cit>  and abi <dig> may play a role in sugar-induced seedling developmental arrest  <cit> . the tf genes iaa <dig> and arf <dig> showed high negative correlation with the unknown metabolites unkm <dig>  and unkm <dig> , respectively. in order for correlations to be identified a gene had to be expressed at each time point. therefore, it may act in some capacity outside the developmental stage in which it is commonly associated. for example, penfield et al.  <cit>  concluded that factors controlling cotyledon expansion in imbibed seeds -- a gibberellin mediated processes -- continue well into seedling establishment. the cho <dig> ap <dig> domain tf that functions in the glucose signaling pathway downstream of abi <dig> also appears to function well into seedling establishment  <cit> . in support of these views, it is interesting that we observe expression of genes known to be involved in the imposition of dormancy well into seedling establishment.

abi <dig> expression decreases within two days of imbibition to remove dormancy and permit seed germination. arf <dig> is believed to increase seed sensitivity to aba  <cit>  and its delayed suppression would likely contribute to a graded control of aba responses while abi <dig> transcript levels decline. in contrast, the levels of slr/iaa <dig> transcripts are increasing until day 4- <dig>  slr/iaa <dig> is known to repress arf <dig> and arf <dig> during initiation of lateral roots  <cit>  and it is interesting to speculate that it may play an additional role to restrict the expression of arf <dig> to vascular tissue in cotyledons and roots in older seedlings  <cit> . even if metabolic regulation of highly correlated genes is shown not to occur or is minimal, observing the behavior of expression within a broader physiological and biochemical context through a network correlation analysis may reveal as of yet unknown interactions.

identifying mechanisms of metabolic regulation
imbibition results in seeds undergoing a period of anoxia during which lactate production occurs  <cit> . in animals, elevated lactate has been shown to alter gene expression in certain tumor types  <cit>  and may involve carbohydrate response-like elements  <cit> . we looked for elements within the promoters of photosynthetic genes correlated to lactate and unkm <dig>  as a start toward identifying regulatory mechanisms  in a manner analogous to co-regulated genes identified by microarray analysis  <cit> . genes correlated with lactate contained ocs-like elements responsive to oxidative stress, auxin and salicylic acid  <cit>  and motifs showing similarity to those involved in light-responses. since it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of light and metabolic stimulus  <cit> , it is possible that elements identified as light responsive might be metabolite responsive instead. interestingly, the potential promoter motifs identified in the photosynthetic genes correlated with metabolite unkm <dig>  predominantly included elements associated with response to various stresses and did not contain any light-responsive elements. the differences between the potential promoter motifs identified in the two sets of photosynthetic genes indicate that distinct regulatory mechanisms may be operate in groups of genes that may be considered initially as functionally similar through ontological classification. identification of the tfs that bind to these motifs, and the characterization of identified, but unknown promoter elements will help elucidate the signaling pathways involved in the expression of these genes and potential involvement of metabolic regulation.

the pair-wise analysis of metabolite and transcript levels appears to be a useful investigatory tool to identify potential links between genes and metabolites, thereby providing a number of targets for further examination. however, the identification of a correlated gene and metabolite does not provide information relating to the causality within the relationship, i.e. metabolite affecting gene expression or vice versa. it is also difficult to determine whether the observed relationship results from a direct interaction between a gene and a metabolite, or whether a downstream signaling event is involved. such questions can be addressed, in part, by repeating the metabolite measurements in the appropriate mutant and/or by direct measurement of transcript levels in rigorously controlled metabolite feeding experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
a systems biology approach was adopted to investigate the interactions of metabolites and gene expression during seedling development. both transcript and metabolite data were analysed at various levels and the results visualized using pca and correlation-based network cartography. the analysis of transcript data alone showed that germination and seedling development is marked by stages of differing gene expression activity. these stages fall at important developmental points, such as at the beginning of seedling emergence, the end of reserve mobilization and the onset of leaf formation. metabolite levels were revealed to fall into two clusters that reflect the pattern and timing of change, principally those that decrease post-imbibition and those that show a transient increase after seedling emergence. network cartography, whereby the degree of correlation between variables was used as the basis of sample comparison, provided a clearer picture of the relationship among samples than pca. this network analysis indicates a shift in the state of nutritionally important metabolites precedes the major shift in transcriptional state going from germination to seedling emergence. therefore, a suitable metabolic state achieved prior to germination may be necessary for the initiation of gene expression programs for efficient seedling development. some aspects of gene expression may be regulated by specific metabolites. the key is to identify signaling metabolites and the genes they affect, which may be accomplished by holistic profiling and correlation analysis. in addition, network correlation analysis may reveal component interactions when visualised within the context of a dependent or regulatory process, such as we noted with potential tf relationships uncovered by metabolite correlations.
