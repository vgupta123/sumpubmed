BACKGROUND
thellungiella salsuginea, previously named thellungiella halophila, separated from arabidopsis around 15– <dig> million years ago and occupies an intermediate position between the brassica and arabidopsis clades  <cit> . whereas this crucifer exhibits tolerance to high salt, drought, and cold stress, its close relative arabidopsis thaliana is sensitive to these stresses. comparative physiology and molecular biology studies demonstrated that different strategies are employed by these two species to adapt to stress conditions. t. salsuginea accumulates less sodium under salt stress than does arabidopsis by using different ion uptake and translocation strategies. in contrast to arabidopsis, the concentrations of sodium and potassium are not negatively correlated in t. salsuginea. under salt stress, t. salsuginea plants undergo relatively high rates of transpiration and thus maintain water uptake and ion transport, which are crucial for plant survival  <cit> . the accumulation of high concentrations of compatible osmolytes in the cytosol, including sugars, polyols, and amino acids, is considered to be an effective strategy for acquiring tolerance to salt stress  <cit> . t. salsuginea contains higher levels of proline than does arabidopsis under unstressed conditions, and accumulates 19-fold more proline in the shoot than does arabidopsis under salt stress  <cit> . microarray, qrt-pcr, and metabolite profiling analyses defined distinct stress-responsive genes and pathways that were active during the adaptation to stress conditions in t. salsuginea and arabidopsis  <cit> . the expression patterns of many transcription factors diverged between these two species  <cit> . given that the target genes of micrornas  are predominantly transcription factors  <cit> , we thought that it would be interesting to investigate the role of mirnas in the regulation of salt tolerance in t. salsuginea.

gene regulation by small rnas represents a recently discovered layer of gene expression regulation in eukaryotes, and mirnas are the best characterized of the small rnas in plants  <cit> . mirnas are ~ <dig> nt non-coding rnas that negatively regulate gene expression by mediating mrna cleavage or translational inhibition of its target mrna. mature mirna is preferentially incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex  to direct the post-transcriptional repression of target mrnas  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that mirna regulates various aspects of plant growth and development. for example, mir165/mir <dig> is a critical regulator of adaxial/abaxial patterning in developing leaves  <cit> , mir <dig> governs floral organ development  <cit> , and mir159/mir <dig> regulates the level of teosinte branched/cycloidea/pcf -family transcripts, which control leaf development  <cit> . increasing data from arabidopsis, oryza sativa , and populus indicate that mirnas are stress-regulated and may play critical roles in the plant’s adaptation to environmental stress  <cit> . however, the roles of mirnas in the extreme stress tolerance exhibited by the halophyte t. salsuginea have not been investigated. the release of the entire genome sequence of t. salsuginea <cit>  has greatly stimulated functional and comparative genomics studies of this species, and has enabled us to perform whole genome identification of t. salsuginea mirnas, to predict their target genes, and to investigate how the salt-stress response differs from that in arabidopsis at the level of mirna regulation.

although t. salsuginea can withstand exposure to high concentrations of nacl  <cit>  or sudden osmotic shock , the germination of t. salsuginea seeds is hypersensitive to nacl. shoot succulence of t. salsuginea was affected and growth was inhibited by 200 mm nacl  <cit> . a previous study showed that  <dig> and 250 mm nacl represent a minor irritation and moderate stress, respectively, for t. salsuginea <cit> . to identify t. salsuginea mirnas and investigate their possible roles in salt tolerance, we constructed two small rna libraries. one library, which was used as the control, was derived from the tissues of 40-d-old plants grown under non-stress conditions, and the other library was constructed using 40-d-old plants treated with 200 mm nacl for 24 h. we identified  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> novel mirnas, and  <dig> plausible novel mirna candidates from t. salsuginea. target gene analysis and an investigation of the patterns of mirna accumulation revealed important information about mirnas in t. salsuginea that may elucidate salt tolerance mechanisms in this halophyte plant and others.

RESULTS
comparison of srna populations in cl and tl
to identify mirnas in t. salsuginea, we constructed two small rna libraries. the control library  was constructed using plants grown in hoagland solution without nacl, and the treatment library  used plants treated with 200 mm nacl for 24 h. previous studies indicated that the shoot succulence of t. salsuginea was affected and the growth was inhibited by 200 mm nacl  <cit> . total rna was isolated from the roots and leaves  <dig> d after germination. solexa technology  was used to sequence the small rna enriched libraries, and  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were generated from the cl and tl, respectively . the length of the small rna sequences ranged from 10– <dig> nt . in both libraries, 24-nt sequences represented the largest group, followed by a group of  <dig> nt. sequences of  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt represented the third largest group. the abundance of most small rnas from 10– <dig> nt in the tl was higher than that in the cl. only  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 30-nt small rnas were less abundant in the tl than in the cl .

after removal of the adaptor sequences, polya sequences, and sequences of less than  <dig> nt,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from the cl and tl, respectively, and used for further analysis and mirna discovery . the two libraries shared  <dig>  unique small rnas, which accounted for  <dig> % of the total unique sequences. we detected  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  unique sequences in the cl and tl, respectively. together, the two libraries shared  <dig> %  of the total small rna sequences. we identified  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig>  small rnas that were specifically present in the cl and tl, respectively . about 60% of these sequences could be successfully mapped to a particular region of the t. salsuginea genome .

based on a comparison with the reference genome and relevant bioinformatics analysis, these small rnas fell into the following categories: rrna, trna, snrna, exon_antisense, exon_sense, intron_antisense, intron_sense, unannotated, and mirna candidate sequences. the mirna candidate sequences represented only about  <dig> % of the unique small rnas . most sequences  were unannotated . although the total number of candidate mirna sequences from the tl  was less than that from the cl , more clean reads were sequenced from the tl. similarly, fewer unique candidate mirna sequences were identified in the tl  than in the cl  . these results indicate that mirna biogenesis is down regulated in t. salsuginea when the plants are treated with 200 mm nacl.

identification of known mirnas and their variants
to identify mirnas in t. salsuginea that have previously been reported in other plant species, small rnas were compared with published mirnas by conducting a blastn search against mirbase  <dig>  , in which  <dig> plant mirnas were registered. we identified  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> known mirna families . the pre-mirnas of  <dig> of these known mirnas were discovered, and the secondary structures of these mirnas are listed in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  previous studies indicated that  <dig> conserved mirna families are present in both moncot and dicot model species  <cit> . mir <dig> is the only conserved mirna family that was not detected in these two t. salsuginea libraries. we only considered sequences that perfectly matched previously identified mature mirna sequences as known mirnas. sequences with one or two mismatches or gaps relative to the known mirnas and that were represented in a minimum of  <dig> reads in at least one library were considered as mirna variants . we identified a total of  <dig> mirna variants, which we named tsa-mirv <dig> to tsa-mirv <dig>  many variants of some mirna families were identified, highlighting the complexity of the mirna variants. for example, we identified  <dig> variants of mir <dig> 
thellungiella


we identified the thellungiella homolog of most mirnas that were conserved in arabidopsis, populus trichocarpa, vitis vinifera, oryza sativa, and brassica napus, including mir156a, mir157a, d, mir164a, mir166a, and mir167a . a few mirnas, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were only present in one to three of the five species. mir <dig> and mir <dig> were not present in these five species, while mir <dig> was only reported in populus trichocarpa . in agreement with previous bioinformatics studies, these results indicate the varied extent to which different mirna families are conserved  <cit> . in most cases, multiple members from one conserved mirna family were detected; for example, we discovered  <dig> different members of mir156/ <dig> and  <dig> different members of mir165/mir <dig>  interestingly, some mirnas, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were scarce, while their variants were abundant. for example, mir <dig> was sequenced about  <dig> times, while its variants  were sequenced more than  <dig>  times in these two libraries. tsa-mirv <dig> and tsa-mirv <dig>  the two variants of mir <dig>  were the most abundant variants in t. salsuginea, being detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  times in cl and  <dig>  and  <dig>  times in the tl, respectively . these results demonstrate that tsa-mirv <dig> and tsa-mirv <dig> are the dominant mature sequences of mir <dig> in t. salsuginea.

the abundance of identified conserved mirnas was significantly different, ranging from only a few to more than half a million counts. the most abundant expressed mirna in t. salsuginea was mir156a, which was detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  times in the cl and tl, respectively . mir156q, mir157a, mir157d, mir166a, mir167a, mir168a, and mir172a were highly expressed, with more than  <dig>  reads sequenced in each library. about  <dig> other mirna members showed a moderate expression level, with  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads in each library. the abundance of most other mirnas  was low, ranging from a few to a hundred counts in each library .

a comparison of the  <dig> known mirnas in the two libraries revealed that the abundance of  <dig> mirnas decreased under salt treatment , including three mirnas detected only in the cl. only  <dig> mirnas exhibited more than a  <dig> -fold upregulation upon 200 mm nacl treatment. however, the abundance of some mirnas was extremely low in both the cl and tl, suggesting that the differential expression of these mirnas may not be linked to the salt response. overall, the abundance of mirnas that exhibited increased expression in the tl was low. however, mir <dig>  mir165a, mir166a, and mir168a were strongly expressed in both libraries and were up-regulated in the tl . the abundance of  <dig> variants was down-regulated , including that of  <dig> variants detected only in the cl. the nacl treatment up-regulated the expression of  <dig> variants by more than  <dig> -fold, including  <dig> variants detected only in the tl. the expression patterns of most variants were in accordance with those of known mirnas . t. salsuginea mir <dig> and its variants tsa-mirv <dig> and tsa-mirv <dig> were highly expressed in both libraries, particularly after the nacl treatment. t. salsuginea mir <dig> was strongly induced by the nacl treatment, while arabidopsis mir <dig> was induced by cold and mannitol, but not by salt  <cit> . the differential response of these mirnas to salt stress suggests that they may have a key role in salt tolerance.

identification of novel mirnas
we used previously described criteria to predict specific mirnas of t. salsuginea <cit> . the precursor of each novel mirna was identified and could form a proper secondary hairpin structure with a maximal free energy of -18 kcal/mol. we identified  <dig> novel mirna families and  <dig> plausible candidate mirnas  from the two libraries . the free energy of the identified novel mirnas and pcs ranged from - <dig>  kcal mol- <dig> to - <dig> .kcal mol- <dig>  blastn searches against all nucleotide sequences in ncbi databases were performed using these mirna sequences as queries. no homolog was found in any other plant species, suggesting that these newly identified candidate mirnas are all thellungiella-specific. the abundance of most mir* sequences identified in this study was less than  <dig> counts, except for tsa-mirn <dig>  tsa-mirn <dig>  tsa-mirn <dig>  and tsa-mirn <dig> . previous studies indicated that both the 5p and 3p sequences of some mirnas could be recruited into the silencing complex and function as mirnas  <cit> . the abundance of the majority of novel mirnas and plausible candidates was relatively low compared with that of conserved mirnas. however, some novel mirnas were abundant; for example, mirn <dig> , tsa-mirn20-3p , mirn <dig> , pc <dig> , and pc <dig>  .
thellungiella


novel mirna is the name of detected novel mirnas. -5p and -3p means the novel mirna and mir*. genomic locations of pre-mirna are listed: the t. salsuginea genome sequence was downloaded from the t. salsuginea sequencing resource: website ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/v <dig> /thalophila/assembly/). +, sense strand. -, anti-sense strand.

many mirnas were detected in only one library; for instance, tsa-mirn <dig>  tsa-mirn <dig>  and tsa-mirn <dig> were only present in the tl, and tsa-mirn <dig>  tsa-mirn <dig>  tsa-mirn <dig>  and tsa-mirn <dig> only in the cl . thirty-one novel candidate mirnas were only detected in the cl and thirty were only found in the tl . due to the low abundance of most novel mirnas, the specificity of these mirnas in one library may not truly reflect a specific expression pattern under a particular growth condition. however, a few putative mirnas were expressed only in one library at relatively high abundance . these mirnas may function as key regulators of the salt stress response in t. salsuginea. previous functional studies of the predicted target genes of tsa-mirn <dig> and pc <dig> support this hypothesis  <cit>  . considering the environmental, developmental, and tissue-specific regulation of mirna expression, the mirnas identified in our study probably represent only part of the t. salsuginea mirna population. it remains to be determined how much overlap exists between the mirnas identified in this study and those that are responsive to cold or drought stress.

expression analysis of mirnas by microarray and qrt-pcr analysis
the expression of some conserved mirnas in leaves and roots was examined in the presence or absence of nacl treatment using an affymetrix mirna chip. about  <dig> probes on this chip corresponded with  <dig> plant mirnas. these probes  shared identical sequences with the thellungella mirnas. twenty-six of these mirnas were represented by more than three probes on the chip and were used in the expression analysis. the remaining  <dig> mirnas, which had less than three probes on the chip, were not used in the expression analysis. in this study, leaf and root tissues were sampled separately after  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h of nacl treatment. the expression of some conserved mirnas was up- or down-regulated  by the nacl treatment . differential expression patterns in the roots and leaves were observed for some mirnas . for example, the expression of tsa-mir164a and tsa-mir171c decreased in roots, but increased in leaves after salt treatment.

to verify the expression of the newly identified thellungella mirnas, a stem-loop qrt-pcr assay was carried out. the expression of nine conserved mirnas and two candidate novel mirnas  was analyzed. the results were consistent with the solexa sequencing data .

target gene prediction of known and novel mirnas
we predicted more than  <dig> potential target genes for all of the  <dig> known t. salsuginea mirna families. these target genes included  <dig>  transcription factors . interestingly, three stress-responsive transcription factors, one aba-responsive factor, and two ethylene-responsive factors were the predicted targets of thellungiella mirnas. genes involved in a broad range of developmental and physiological processes were also predicted to be mirna targets in this study. several genes encoding ion transporters or ion channels were identified as target genes of thellungiella mirnas, including an inward rectifying potassium channel, high-affinity nickel-transport family protein, ca2+ transporting atpase, plasma membrane sulphate transporter, boron transporter, calcium-binding protein annexin  <dig>  fe transport protein irt <dig>  putative cadmium/zinc-transporting atpase  <dig>  and sulfite exporter taue. in addition, many target genes identified in this study were directly or indirectly involved in the stress response or stress tolerance, including two salt-inducible proteins and two e <dig> ubiquitin ligases  <cit> .

following the published criteria for target gene prediction  <cit> ,  <dig> target genes were predicted from  <dig> novel and  <dig> pc thellungilla mirnas. these predicted target genes had a wide range of biological functions, and many encode transcription factors. one-hundred-and-nine targets encoded transcription factors or splicing factors thought to affect gene expression directly. many of these transcription factors  protein, nac transcription factor, and wrky transcription factor) are key regulators in the salt, drought, or cold stress response  <cit> . interestingly, ion and macromolecular transporters, which may play key roles in ion homeostasis or the accumulation of compatible molecules under stress conditions, were significantly enriched in targets of these novel mirnas. many mirnas were predicted to target a variety of transporters and ion channels, such as an anion transporter, ion channel clc- <dig>  abc transporter, and efflux pump . furthermore, a number of other proteins known to be key players in the stress response were predicted to be targets of the thellungiella novel mirnas or mirna candidates . the discovery that genes directly or indirectly involved in stress response pathways are potential targets of the newly identified thellungiella mirnas suggests that mirna regulation is an important layer of stress tolerance in this plant.

validating the cleavage of target mrna by 5’ race
to test whether the identified mirnas could mediate the cleavage of the predicted target mrnas, a 5’ race experiment was performed. the targets of the conserved mirnas, mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir160-3p, mir <dig>  mir171a, and mir171c, were cleaved at a site corresponding to the 10th mirna nucleotide from the 5’ end . mismatches between the mirna molecules and their binding sites on the target were rare. mir171a was 100% complementary to the binding site of the target. one or two mismatches were indentified in the other mirna/target pairs. no mismatches were found at the 10th and 11th nucleotides in any of these mirna/target pairs.

due to high levels of sequence similarity, the different members within an mirna family may target the same gene. for example, several mir156/ <dig> members could target the sbp transcription factor at the same site on the target mrna. we analyzed an sbp gene with high sequence similarity to arabidopsis spl <dig> by 5’ race. the target was cleaved at the position between the 9th and 10th nucleotides by thellungiella mir156a, mir156e, and mir157b. however, this position was corresponding to the 10th and 11th nucleotide of thellungiella mir156n, mir156o, and mir157a . in phaseolus vulgaris, the cleavage site of the sbp-like related gene was located between the 10th and 11th nucleotide of mir156a  <cit> . an sbp transcription factor, a ppr repeat protein, and a mads box transcription factor were predicted to be targets of tsa-mir156/ <dig>  tsa-mir <dig>  and tsa-mir <dig>  respectively. however, the 5’ race experiment only detected cleavage of these genes upstream or downstream of the mirna/target-binding region, but not at the predicted sites . thus, the target cleavage positions were predominantly at around the 10th nucleotide from the 5’ end of the mirna, but some might mediate cleavage at other locations.

discussion
accumulating evidence suggests that mirnas play essential roles in both abiotic and biotic stress responses. however, a systematic identification of mirnas from the stress-tolerant model plant t. salsuginea had hitherto not been accomplished. taking advantage of the sequenced genome of t. salsuginea and high-throughput sequencing technology, the present study reported the first large-scale identification of t. salsuginea mirnas. a total of  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> non-conserved known mirna families, as well as  <dig> novel mirnas and  <dig> plausible candidates were discovered. some of the mirnas were differentially expressed in the presence or absence of 200 mm nacl. interestingly, three novel and  <dig> plausible candidates of novel mirnas were only detected in nacl-treated samples.

most of the conserved mirnas exhibited decreased abundance upon treatment with 200 mm nacl. only  <dig> mirnas showed more than a  <dig> -fold increase in abundance after nacl treatment. the overall abundance of these differentially expressed mirnas was low in both libraries, with the exception of mir166f, mir168a, tsa-mir <dig>  and tsa-mir408-5p. the abundance of these mirnas was high in both libraries. in agreement with our results, previous studies consistently demonstrated that mir <dig>  mir168a, and mir <dig> were all responsive to stress conditions, including salt and drought stress  <cit> .

the expression of mir <dig> was inhibited and the expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> was induced by salt, cold, dehydration, and aba in arabidopsis  <cit> , while these three mirnas and their variants were not detected in t. salsuginea. phaseolus mir <dig> was induced by nacl, dehydration, and aba, but thellungiella mir393a was only detected once in each library, and mir393b-3p showed decreased expression upon salt treatment. in agreement with results from phaseolus <cit> , thellungiella mir159b exhibited increased expression levels under salt stress . mir167c was strongly up-regulated by  <dig> h of nacl treatment in arabidopsis, while thellungiella mir167a-h showed similar or decreased expression levels under nacl stress conditions  <cit>  . mir <dig> expression was induced by salt treatment in populus, while it was repressed in arabidopsis  <cit> . very low levels of mir <dig> expression were detected in both control and nacl-treated thellungiella libraries ; however, its variant, tsa-mirv <dig>  was sequenced with relatively high abundance , indicating that nacl induced mir <dig> in thellungiella. the conservation and divergence of mirna expression under different stress conditions illustrates the complexity of mirna regulation.

the target genes of all identified known mirna families,  <dig> novel mirnas, and  <dig> plausible candidates were predicted. the identified target genes are involved in multiple biological processes. many transport proteins or ion channels were predicted as targets of conserved and thellungiella-specific mirnas. some of these proteins have been well studied and their roles in salt tolerance or the stress response have been established. maintenance of na+, k+ homeostasis is required for plant survival in a high salinity environment. hkt <dig>  a k+ transporter, contributed significantly to na+ uptake in arabidopsis and rice and plays key roles in salt tolerance  <cit> . substantial transcriptional regulation of the high affinity k+ transporter was observed under salt stress  <cit> . the k+ transporter gene was identified as a novel mirna target in thellungiella. an inward rectifying potassium channel, a member of the akt protein family, exhibits non-specific na+ uptake activity under high concentrations of na+ <cit> . in the halophytic plant m. crystallinum, the expression of the akt <dig> homolog decreased in response to salt stress  <cit> . we found that the inward rectifying potassium channel was the target of thellungiella mirna.

besides tolerance to salinity, thellungiella exhibits high tolerance to dehydration and cold stresses  <cit> . the novel mirna candidates identified in our study may represent small rnas that are expressed in a relatively high level under non-stress or salt stress conditions. a previous study revealed that gene expression in response to cold, drought, and salinity showed little overlap  <cit> . therefore, we do not expect much overlap in thellungiella mirnas involved in the plant’s response to different stresses. it would be interesting to determine which mirnas from thellungiella are activated upon exposure to cold or drought stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
about thirteen million high-quality small rnas were sequenced from each library. totally, we identified  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirna candidates from t. salsuginea. in addition,  <dig> target mrnas were predicted. differentially expressed mirnas between nacl treated and the control samples were analyzed using solexa sequence data and part of them were validated by microarray and together with qrt-pcr. this study lay the basis for functional studies of mirna in t. salsuginea and enables us to access the salt tolerance mechanism of this plant species from the layer of small rna regulation.
