BACKGROUND
two fundamental concepts within conservation genetics are that i) genetic diversity is important for population persistence and ii) that the amount of genetic diversity is mostly determined by the effective population size , which is typically much smaller than the census size   <cit> . theoretical models predict that severe reductions in population size termed as population bottlenecks, have a significant impact on the ne, and thus the genetic diversity of populations, so understandably, species that have undergone bottlenecks are often the focus of genetic studies. significant bottlenecks occurred in populations of black-footed ferrets  whooping cranes , and northern elephant seal , and all three species have low genetic variation within the contemporary populations. however, the short-tailed albatross phoebastria albatrus, which declined to 50– <dig> individuals, has high levels of genetic variation  <cit> .

the genetic consequences of population bottlenecks can be directly assessed when pre-bottleneck levels of genetic variation can be measured and compared to contemporary samples. for example, temporally spaced samples were used to demonstrate that the loss of mtdna variation in the nēnē  occurred during prehistoric times, and not during more recent declines  <cit> . recent declines did however, impact genetic diversity in greater prairie chickens  <cit> , but only influenced genetic structure in peregrine falcon  populations  <cit> .

kirtland’s warbler  is the rarest songbird in north america, with a history of rarity and population declines. kirtland’s warblers are neotropical migrants that during breeding, specialize on early-successional stands of jack pine  in the lower peninsula of michigan, and overwinter in the bahamian archipelago   <cit> . historical records, and estimates of past habitat availability, suggest that kirtland’s warblers were not a common species in the 19th century, perhaps numbering less than  <dig> birds  <cit> . however, in the 1940s, kirtland’s warbler populations began to decline markedly, consisting of only  <dig> males in the 1950s. the decline is likely because on the breeding grounds, kirtland’s warbler abundance is closely linked to the incidence of large-scale wildfires that generate the early successional jack pine habitat on which these warblers are specialized  <cit> . the absence of large fires during 1946– <dig> reduced the amount of early-successional jack pine stands, which, when compounded with brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird , had severe demographic consequences for kirtland’s warblers. kirtland’s warblers were listed as an endangered species in  <dig>  and by  <dig>  only  <dig> kirtland’s warbler males were counted, which was down from the  <dig> males counted in  <dig> . this alarming decline led to cowbird control measures, which likely prevented extinction, but kirtland warbler populations only began to increase after several large fires increased the availability of larger tracts of suitable habitat  <cit> . fortunately, these management efforts have resulted in the kirtland’s warbler populations increasing to an estimated  <dig> males in  <dig> 

in this study we have two objectives, we first measure and compare the genetic diversity from samples collected in oscoda county, michigan , across three time periods: 1903– <dig>  1929– <dig> and 2008– <dig>  secondly, we determine if the scenario inferred from the molecular data is concordant with the historical census data and if any additional insight could be gained into the population structure of the declining kirtland’s warbler population.

RESULTS
genetic diversity
after correcting for the multiple tests, none of the loci departed from hardy-weinberg equilibrium, and all loci were also in linkage equilibrium. the null allele and dropout tests implemented by microchecker did not suggest that large allele drop out or null alleles were an issue. in the hp-rare hierarchical rarefaction, the rarefied sample was limited to  <dig> genes and one time period. the hierarchical rarefaction provides three estimates of allelic richness for three pooled time periods  and six estimates for 3–4 year subdivided intervals. the group-level estimates of allelic richness for the three time periods were lowest in the contemporary population , followed by the middle sampling period  and highest in the early sampling . the allelic richness estimates for the subdivided intervals was similar in the 1903– <dig>  1929– <dig>  1934– <dig> and 1940– <dig> samples, but the 1951– <dig> sample had lower allelic richness than all other intervals. with the exception of 1951– <dig>  the 2008– <dig> sample had the next lowest estimate of allelic richness .

on a group-level, private allelic richness was highest in the early sample  , while private allelic richness in the middle , and contemporary populations , were comparable. the five subdivided estimates between  <dig> and  <dig> are slightly variable with the 1951– <dig> sample being very low .

the allelic accumulation curve illustrates that as the rarefied sample size increased, the total number of distinct alleles within each sample became statistically different between the 2008– <dig> and 1929– <dig> samples at a rarefied sample of  <dig> individuals . as a comparison, at a rarefied sample size of  <dig>  the allelic richness of the 1903– <dig> population is  <dig> , 1929– <dig> population is  <dig> , and the 2008– <dig> sample has an allelic richness of  <dig> . so these analyses suggest that genetic variation was lost during the sampling periods of 1929– <dig> and 2008– <dig> 

individual heterozygosity  was not statistically different between time periods. the internal relatedness, was significantly higher within individuals in the 1903– <dig> time sample ), compared to the average of the 1929– <dig> samples ) and 2008– <dig> ) samples . higher values of internal relatedness suggest that the parents of a particular individual were more closely related than another individual with a lower internal relatedness.

direct inference of ne
based on the kirtland’s warbler census data from 1971– <dig>  the effect of the population decline would have reduced the effective size of the kirtland’s warbler population by approximately 52%, with a maximal long-term ne of approximately  <dig>  this estimate assumes that for each counted male, there was an uncounted female and assuming that no factors increasing the ne are influential in the population.

molecular inference of ne
the molecular inference of ne based on the linkage disequilibrium method for the 2008– <dig> sample was ne = <dig> . the ne point estimate for 1929– <dig> was ne =  <dig> , but for the 1903– <dig> sample, the estimate was indeterminable likely because of missing data, or because the true ne may be larger than what can be precisely estimated with this method  <cit> . the temporal estimates of ne provided comparable estimates of the harmonic ne spanning from  <dig> to  <dig>  both when two ); and three ); sampling periods were used in the analysis. the temporal estimates of ne range from  <dig> to  <dig>  but the lower limits of these large confidence intervals are somewhat close to the direct estimate of ne ~ <dig> 

genetic bottleneck test
there was no significant heterozygosity excess in the 1903– <dig> sample under all three mutation models . the sample from 1929– <dig> only had support for significant heterozygosity excess under the iam models for both the wilcoxon  and sign test . similarly, the sample from 2008– <dig> had significant heterozygosity excess assuming an iam mutation model  for the wilcoxon and sign tests . under the tpm and smm models, neither the 1929– <dig> or 2008– <dig> periods had significant heterozygosity excess. all time periods showed a normal l-shaped allele frequency distribution.

structure analyses
the cluster analyses as implemented by structure identified the most probable model as k =  <dig> . under the k =  <dig> model, cluster membership distributions were similar across individuals in the 1903– <dig> and 1929– <dig> sampling periods. in the 2008– <dig> sampling period, the cluster membership assignments shifted towards the second cluster .

population simulations
the population simulation that assumed a ne/nc ratio of  <dig>  best matched the allelic accumulation curves for the 2008– <dig> sample . the estimated ne from the final generation in the simulation was substantially larger at  <dig> , but the 95% interval of the simulation overlaps the direct estimate of ne under the assumptions of a ne/nc of  <dig>   and the upper range of ne for the 2008– <dig> sample. for the bottleneck tests, under the iam models, the simulated data of ne/nc =  <dig>  showed excess heterozygotes in all  <dig> loci, both when a subset of  <dig> individuals was used  and when the entire simulated final population was used .

discussion
based on habitat availability and sighting records, kirtland’s warblers were not a common species in the early 19th century  <cit> . if historical estimates are accurate, a large population decline occurred sometime between 19th century and the first census in the 1950s, when only  <dig> birds were counted. however, we don’t know if this decline occurred as a slow deterministic decline, or as a more rapid series of bottlenecks. it is possible that the greatest population decline occurred prior to 1902– <dig>  so comparing the variation between 1902– <dig> and more contemporary samples reflect genetic effects of demography during those periods. however, between  <dig> and  <dig>  the kirtland’s warbler population underwent a 60% decline within a decade, followed by 20 years at a low  population size. this population history resulted in a loss of allelic diversity in contemporary kirtland’s warbler populations, which is made evident by the higher levels of diversity found in samples collected in 1903– <dig> and 1929– <dig>  we estimate that  <dig>  alleles/locus have been lost in the kirtland’s warbler population over that time frame. in comparison, the wisconsin population of greater prairie chicken which had undergone a 90% decline to approximately  <dig> individuals, lost an estimated  <dig>  alleles/locus  <cit> . although the allelic richness in the early kirtland’s warbler populations was higher than the contemporary sample, individual heterozygosity did not differ between time periods. the increased loss of allelic variation, compared to heterozygosity is an expected outcome in population bottleneck scenarios  <cit> , and has been reported in other species  <cit> .

the consequences of the kirtland’s warbler’s demographic history can also be seen in the strong temporal clustering of samples from 1903– <dig> versus 2008– <dig> , which is most likely due to the influence of genetic drift. this pattern of contemporary and historic samples forming distinct genetic clusters was also reported in dutch populations of black grouse , which also have a history of population decline  <cit> . for populations with reduced ne, genetic drift can be a strong force that leads to both a loss of genetic variation, and genetic divergence among populations  <cit> . in studies where historic and contemporary genetic structure can be compared, the potential impact of genetic drift becomes more evident.

what do the genetic patterns suggest about the decline process?

in populations that have undergone documented declines, molecular data can provide information on the true severity of the bottleneck, and serve as a reminder that demographically consequential events may be difficult to detect genetically  <cit> . it is known from census data that kirtland’s warbler underwent a bottleneck, and that the expected signals of excess heterozygotes and reduced ne <cit>  were present in the 1929– <dig> and 2008– <dig> samples, but only under certain model assumptions. the absence of a bottleneck signal in the 1903– <dig> sample could suggest that either kirtland’s warblers had not yet begun to decline, or if they were declining prior to 1903– <dig>  the decline occurred in a slow deterministic manner rather than in a series of intense bottlenecks.

dispersal patterns can complicate the genetic signature of a declining population. for example in populations of fennoscandian lesser white-fronted goose , changes in immigration patterns led to a temporary increase in genetic variation within a declining population  <cit> . we suspect that changes in distribution of kirtland’s warblers are also being reflected in the population genetic structure, which is apparent because we sampled in a single locality. however, the bayesian cluster analysis  does not provide any evidence of admixture in the 1929– <dig> sample, but a caveat being that admixture signals would only be present if populations were divergent  <cit> . kirtland’s warbler census data across counties also support this scenario because as habitat became more broadly available and population sizes increased, the proportion of the kirtland’s warbler population that is located in any one county tends to be lower .

prior to 1929– <dig>  the kirtland’s warbler population may have been more clustered and fragmented, which would account for the higher internal relatedness in the 1903– <dig> sample. alternatively, the higher internal relatedness in the 1903– <dig> sample could be due to these specimens being collected over a more restricted area, which is possible given that only a general collection location is provided for the 1903– <dig> specimens .

CONCLUSIONS
the conservation implications of the genetic variation that has been lost in kirtland’s warblers are difficult to assess, given that there is some uncertainty in the correlation between microsatellite and genomic variation  <cit> , and predicting the impact of these losses on the fitness of non-model organisms is still poorly understood. there are cases of species existing at low levels of molecular variation for extended periods  <cit> , but it is generally believed that genetic factors do impact the capacity of a population to recover from population declines  <cit> .

the ne is often an important parameter for endangered species management and policy  <cit> . the utility of our ne estimates for evaluating the short-term genetic status of the kirtland’s warblers depends on the accuracy and precision of our contemporary ne estimates simulations suggest that it is difficult to obtain a precise estimate of ne when the true ne is > <dig> because at those sizes of ne, sampling error is large compared to the strength of the drift induced shifts in heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium  <cit> . our direct estimate of a maximal ne of  <dig> is approaching the parameter space where ne is difficult to estimate  <cit> . therefore, the large confidence limits around our ne estimates, limit our ability to definitively state whether the current size of kirtland’s warbler populations can meet conservation genetic objectives such as maintaining 90% of the initial diversity for a minimum of 100 years  <cit> , but the lower range of our ne estimates are too low for genetic variability to be retained in the long-term.

based on our indirect estimates of contemporary ne in the 100– <dig> range, kirtland’s warbler populations may not be large enough to safeguard against the loss of evolutionary potential  <cit> . population bottlenecks can downwardly bias ne estimates  <cit> , but our contemporary sample is more than  <dig> generations away from the lowest recorded population size, so we assume that this bias is not a major influence on our estimates  <cit> .

the ratio between nc and ne has pragmatic use in conservation management, provided that the ne/nc ratio is relatively consistent across time  <cit> . among a variety of common and rare species, ne/nc estimates range from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit>  so that genetic management could still be necessary at surprisingly large census sizes. our lowest estimate of the ne/nc ratio for the contemporary kirtland’s warbler population was approximately  <dig> , in which case, target population sizes would need to exceed  <dig> individuals in order to meet the ne = <dig> recommendation as per franklin and frankham , or even larger population targets would be needed if the recommended ne =  <dig> of lynch and lande  is adopted.

studies attempting to estimate ne in other endangered avian populations also reported wide confidence limits , 500 < ne <  <dig>  <cit> ; yellow-eyed penguin , 200 < ne <  <dig>  <cit> , which may be problematic in cases where greater precision is needed for management decisions. genetic monitoring holds promise for the rapid detection of major population declines  <cit>  however, the discrepancy between biologically significant patterns and the conditions where these patterns are genetically detectable should always be considered  <cit> .
