BACKGROUND
sexual dimorphism, i.e. systematic differences between the sexes within a species, is a well known phenomenon that occurs in most taxa. some of the more conspicuous examples of sexual dimorphism are the appearance of miniature parasitic males in anglerfish, the tail of the peacock, and the song of the male nightingale . sexual dimorphism occurs even though the sexes have virtually identical dna sequences. hence, sexual dimorphism must in most cases arise due to mechanisms involving gene regulation and gene expression  <cit> . in line with this, a high degree of sex-biased gene expression is a common feature in many different species  <cit> .

sex-biased genes evolve rapidly, both in terms of their dna sequence and in their gene expression profiles  <cit> . due to their rapid evolution and the fact that they are often involved in reproduction  <cit>  or are coding for species specific traits, like for example song and plumage in birds, sex-biased genes are likely to play an important role in sexual selection and speciation  <cit> . accordingly, genes with sex-biased gene expression are often subjected to strong selection  <cit> . comparisons of gene expression profiles of related species can shed light on the extent of evolution in sex-biased gene expression, and thus give indications of which genes that are involved in the evolution of sex-specific traits during the process of speciation. the sex-biased gene expression in the brain is perhaps of particular interest in this context, because it is linked to behavioural differences between males and females  <cit>  and thereby to the evolutionary basis of sex-specific behaviours such and how these vary between species.

genes with sex-biased gene expression are expected to be non-randomly distributed in the genome, with an enrichment of such genes on sex chromosomes . this is due to the sex-bias in the transmission pattern of these chromosomes, where one sex carries two copies and the other sex only one copy. the uneven dose of x and z chromosomes between the sexes should lead to an accumulation of sexually antagonistic genes on these chromosomes, i.e. genes that are beneficial to one sex but harmful to the other  <cit> . dominant or partly dominant mutations on x or z chromosomes are exposed to selection twice as often in the homogametic as in the heterogametic sex. such a mutation is therefore expected to go to fixation if it is beneficial to homogametic individuals  even if it is harmful to the opposite  sex  <cit> . sex-linked recessive mutations, on the other hand, will always be exposed to selection in the heterogametic sex . thus, a recessive antagonistic mutation will readily reach fixation if it is beneficial to heterogametic individuals  <cit> . once antagonistic alleles have been fixed, selection for down-regulation of such alleles in the sex that carries the cost is expected to occur  <cit> . this process will induce or increase sex-bias in gene expression and sex chromosomes should thereby be enriched for sex-biased genes  <cit> .

birds are excellent model systems for studies of sexual dimorphism in gene expression due to their extreme sex-dimorphism in morphology and behaviour  <cit> . at present, large scale genomic resources are only available for two bird species, the chicken  and the zebra finch . galliformes and passeriformes have highly conserved genome structure with few inter-chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> , and this opens up the possibility of using the genome structure of the chicken and zebra finch as templates for synteny and gene order for a number of species related to these birds. in the present study, we have used a genome-wide affymetrix microarray designed for the zebra finch  <cit>  in order to study the extent of sexual dimorphism in gene expression in two passerine birds, the zebra finch and the common whitethroat . the zebra finch and the common whitethroat are separated by approximately 24- <dig> million years of evolution  <cit> . the extent to which these two bird species share patterns of sex-biased gene expression in the brain could shed light on the flexibility, or degree of conservation, of the gene expression profiles underlying sexually dimorphic behaviours.

methods
zebra finch study population and rna extraction
total rna from full telencephalon of  <dig> female and  <dig> male zebra finches was used in this study.

birds were housed at professor art arnolds laboratory at university of california, los angeles, in indoor flight cages holding  <dig> same-sexed individuals. approximately  <dig> additional birds of both sexes were within visual and acoustic but not physical contact of the study animals. cages were kept in a light regime of  <dig> hours of artificial light  followed by  <dig> hours of dark. all birds were hatched at the aviary and sacrificed by decapitation as adults  by the same person. all birds were healthy at the time of sacrifice .

full telencephalon was removed from the skull intact and flash frozen on dry ice. samples were stored at -80°c until total rna was extracted using the protocol for tri reagent . whole telencephalon was rapidly lysed  using a dounce homogenizer, extracted, precipitated, and re-suspended in depc-treated water. all samples were dnase i treated  with turbo dnase i  37û ×  <dig> and then rna isolated using a qiagen rneasy spin column, eluting with nuclease-free water. quality of total rna was determined visually by formaldehyde gel  and using the nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . extractions and dnase treatment were done randomly to avoid batch effects. samples were shipped on dry ice to the sciblu genomics facility in lund, sweden, where hybridizations were performed . all samples had good quality total rna with high and comparable rna integrity numbers .

common whitethroat study population, field methods and rna extraction
total rna from full brain of  <dig> female and  <dig> male common whitethroats  was used in this study. the common whitethroat is a warbler of the family sylviidae, a seasonal breeder and a long distance migratory bird. the species breeds in europe  and winters in africa south of the sahara . birds were caught on two locations, in southern sweden  and central nigeria . birds from both locations were used in order to increase the sample size as much as possible and in order to avoid producing candidate genes from exclusively breeding or exclusively wintering birds in comparison with the lab-reared zebra finches.

common whitethroats were caught in the wild, using mist-nets and playback song. swedish birds  were caught in the end of may  <dig>  and nigerian birds were caught in one session from february to march  <dig> and in a second session in january  <dig> . birds sacrificed were in good condition . all birds caught were adults. samples from  <dig> male and  <dig> female birds from each country were included in microarray analyses below.

birds were sacrificed through decapitation and the entire brain was immediately transferred into a tube containing rna later™ rna stabilization reagent . samples were kept in the field for  <dig> to  <dig> hours , in 4-8°c for one day to three weeks and then in -80°c until extraction. this is within recommendations for rnalater stabilizing reagent .

all common whitethroat samples were extracted using the rneasy lipid tissue mini kit . the brains were removed from the rnalater buffer and the full brain was homogenized in  <dig> ml qiazol lysis reagent per  <dig> mg tissue  using a tissuelyser . the samples were extracted following the exact instructions in the protocol supplied with the kit . qiagen also offers a rnase-free dnase set  for use as an integrated step in the protocol. all common whitethroat samples were treated with dnase this way.

the brain of each individual was extracted one at a time and quality checked in batches of four. extractions were randomized to avoid batch effects. samples were quality checked on a formaldehyde agarose gel  and 260/ <dig> ratios were checked on an ultraspec  <dig> spectrophotometer .

the correct ethical approvals/permits to sacrifice birds were obtained for both species included in this study.

the microarray and hybridization
the lund-zf array is a custom affymetrix array produced for the zebra finch; for detailed description see  <cit> . it contains  <dig> ests corresponding to about  <dig> non-redundant genes. each est is represented by  <dig>  probes  and in total there are  <dig> probes on the array. the array contains no affymetrix mis-match  probes  <cit> .

high-quality total-rna samples representing each individual  were delivered to an affymetrix service provider, the swegene center for integrative biology at lund university , where they were hybridized according to standard affymetrix protocols for rna. before hybridization they were once again quality-checked at sciblu using a nanodrop spectrophotometer and an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer. all samples were of high quality with high and comparable rna integrity numbers  since the lund-zf array contains no mis-match  probes, the cel-files carry only information about the pm probes corresponding to the ests on the array. cel-files were imported into genespring gx  <dig> . <dig> and rma normalized. rma normalization requires no mm probe signals. signal intensities for all ests on the array were then filtered  and quality control was performed with expression console™  <dig> . <dig>   on rma normalized data. for  <dig> samples, affymetrix amplification and hybridization controls showed normal patterns and internal controls showed normal 3'/5' ratios. correlation plots of biological replicates showed high correlations for both data sets. two samples showed a somewhat deviating profile, two common whitethroats, one male and one female. in the case of the male, the sample had degraded somewhat between qc controls at lund university and at sciblu. we found no explanation as to why the female sample was deviating but assumed that something in the sample was interfering with hybridization. the two problematic samples were excluded from all downstream analyses.

filtering of microarray data and hybridization efficiency
signal data for all arrays were filtered to remove the ests with large standard deviation. this was done to remove any potential noise in the data and all ests with standard deviations larger than 30% of the median value for the signal was removed from the analyses. in this filtration,  <dig> ests were removed from the analysis of zebra finch arrays and  <dig> ests were removed from the analyses of common whitethroat arrays. furthermore, all common whitethroat arrays were filtered based on the data produced in a comparative genome hybridization, cgh  <cit> . this was done in order to avoid analysing probes with a high degree of sequence divergence, and  <dig> probes that had non-significant signals in the common whitethroat cgh analysis were removed from downstream analyses. these represent all probes in the cgh analyses that did not hybridize significantly when dna of the common whitethroat was hybridized to the array, but did hybridize significantly when zebra finch dna was hybridized. the  <dig> probes are likely to represent parts of genes on the array that does not function for the common whitethroat due to sequence divergence between the species. the fact that only  <dig> out of the ca.  <dig> probes  were lost in the cgh analyses means that the cross-species hybridisation in this study should not lead to unreliable results for the whitethroat. all ests were flagged according to how many probes they had lost after the  <dig> probes were removed. this provided us with a number between  <dig>  to  <dig> . only ests retaining at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> probes were analysed, the rest  were removed from all downstream analyses of the common whitethroat arrays. the choice of this cut off was motivated by the fact that affymetrix normally allows analyses on probe-sets that retain significant signals on at least  <dig> probes http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx.  <dig> ests lost one probe in the filtering above but were still analysed,  <dig> lost  <dig> probes and  <dig> lost  <dig> probes. after filtering  <dig> ests remained to be analysed on the zebra finch arrays and  <dig> on the common whitethroat arrays.

the fact that only  <dig> ests were removed in the filtering process above confirms that the common whitethroat samples performed well on the chip  <cit> . the efficiency of our filtering is further confirmed when hybridization-performance of whitethroat rna is studied in detail. out of the  <dig> ests that were sex-biased only in the zebra finch in this study  no more than  <dig> had been filtered away. when these  <dig> ests were excluded from analyses the remaining  <dig> ests had not lost significantly more probes than the ests biased in both species . moreover, even if mean raw signal of the common whitethroat chips  was lower than the mean of zebra finch chips  prior to filtering mean hybridization signal in the common whitethroat was not significantly different between the different categories of genes identified in this study . in conclusion, even if the common whitethroat has a disadvantage on the array due to sequence divergence, this problem is minor and can be effectively controlled via filtering.

significance analysis of microarrays
significance analysis of microarray  is a statistical approach to find genes with significant differences in expression in sets of microarray experiments  <cit> . input data is gene expression measurements and response variables for each experiment. sam computes a statistic di for each gene i, measuring the strength of the relationship between gene expression and the response variable. it uses permutations to assess which genes are significant. filtered data was imported into microsoft office excel  <dig> and analysed using the significance analysis of microarrays  <dig>  plugin. two class  tests were run with false discovery rates  set as close to 3% as possible for all analyses. sam was set to  <dig> permutations.

all analyses were done on log  <dig> signals with the response variable being sex, and separately for the two species. males were entered as control group and females as treatment group . no fold change  criterion was specified in sam. this was due to the expected estimates of sexual dimorphism in the brain. for many studies of sexual dimorphism in gene expression, no genes with a fc lower than a prior set level has been listed as significant. this level is often quite high . however, many of these studies have been conducted on gonads, where one would expect the estimates of sex-biased gene expression to be at their highest. in the brain, most gene expression differences between the sexes are not expected to be that high  <cit> . we have accepted all genes identified by the permutation test in sam as significant. in order to facilitate comparisons with other studies of gene expression in birds the fold changes given here were calculated separately on unlogged data for the significant genes, as mean male-expression over mean female-expression. the genes counted as sex-biased in this study have fcs ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the zebra finch and  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the common whitethroat.

est annotation
estimations of redundancies amongst the ests on the array have been made using the annotations produced for each sequence in the estima: songbird build  <dig> assembly  <cit> . the chicken tc-id listed in estima was compared for all ests. ests with identical tc-id were listed as the same gene. we then confirmed non-redundancies by blasting all our ests against the  <dig> . <dig> build of the zebra finch genome. ests with the same chicken-tc-id in estima also had hits against the same chromosome and position in the blast. the ests with no annotation in the estima assembly are simply listed as non-redundant genes here. to generate correct information regarding chromosomal location, we used data from the blast against the  <dig> . <dig> build of the zebra finch genome mentioned above http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/finch/ and genes with non significant hits  in this blast has been labelled no annotation. this annotation gave  <dig> ests with significant z hits on the array ,  <dig> ests with significant autosomal hits , and  <dig> ests with no significant annotation.

RESULTS
zebra finch
the male and female expression levels of the  <dig> ests that remained after filtering in the zebra finch are shown in figure 1a. the sam analyses showed that  <dig> of these  <dig> ests  were significantly differentially expressed between the sexes at a false discovery rate of  <dig> % , while the expected number of false discoveries in this data should be less than  <dig> ests. after annotations, the significant ests were found to correspond to  <dig> non-redundant genes . of the  <dig> identified sex-biased genes, 92% were male-biased in expression  and male-biased genes had a mean fc  of  <dig>  while female-biased genes had a mean fc of  <dig> . out of the significantly sex-biased genes,  <dig> were represented by more than one significantly sex-biased est on the lund-zf array. among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were represented by both female-biased and male-biased ests ; and  <dig> out of the  <dig> ambiguous genes were in turn z-linked. female-biased ests in such genes had lower mean identity to the z-sequence in the zebra finch draft  then the male-biased parts , indicating that some female-biased ests might in fact be sequences from w homologues. when these ests are instead blasted against the chicken genome http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/chicken/, three have significant hits on both z and w.

a total of  <dig> ests corresponding to  <dig> genes were identified in the zebra finch, and  <dig> ests corresponding to  <dig> genes in the common whitethroat.

the majority of the  <dig> non-redundant and unambiguous sex-biased genes were z-linked , and both male-biased and female-biased genes showed a non-random distribution across chromosomes, with an overrepresentation on the z chromosome .

common whitethroat
the male and female expression levels of the  <dig> ests that remained after filtering in the common whitethroat are shown in figure 1b. sam analyses were performed on all these ests and were first run for all swedish birds  versus all nigerian birds . a few genes  were identified as differentially expressed between the two seasons/populations at false discovery rate  <dig>   but none of them were identified in the comparison between the sexes, and so the sexual dimorphism identified here is not driven by birds caught in a particular season. in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> ests  were found to be differentially expressed between the sexes at false discovery rate  <dig>   and the expected number of false discoveries in this data should therefore be less than  <dig> ests. after annotation, the significant ests were found to correspond to  <dig> non-redundant genes . of the  <dig> identified genes, 91% were male-biased in expression  and male-biased genes had a mean fc of  <dig>  while female-biased genes had a mean fc of  <dig> .

out of the  <dig> non-redundant sex-biased genes,  <dig> were found to be represented by more than one significant sex-biased est on the lund-zf array; and of these  <dig>   <dig> were in turn 'ambiguous', i.e. represented by both female-biased and male-biased ests.

also in the common whitethroat, the majority of the  <dig> non-redundant and unambiguous sex-biased genes were z-linked  and the male-biased genes were significantly non-randomly distributed across chromosomes .

comparison of sex-biased gene expression in zebra finch and common whitethroat
in total,  <dig> non-redundant genes were identified as differentially expressed between the sexes in both the zebra finch and the common whitethroat . these  <dig> genes were biased for the same sex in both species and  <dig> of them showed ambiguous regulation . in total,  <dig> non-redundant genes were found to be sex-biased only in the zebra finch  and  <dig> were sex-biased only in the common whitethroat . only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes biased in both species where female-biased and  <dig> of them  were both male-biased and z-linked . the proportion of male-biased and z-linked genes was lower among the genes only biased in the zebra finch  and in the genes only biased in the common whitethroat . moreover, there were no autosomal genes that were sex-biased in both species .

discussion
we found extensive sexual dimorphism in gene expression in the brain of both the zebra finch and the common whitethroat. in light of the many differences between the species in terms of evolutionary time since divergence, sexual behaviour and morphology, and in sampling regimes, it is remarkable that almost 50%  of the genes identified as sex-biased in the zebra finch were also identified as sex-biased in the common whitethroat. these  <dig> genes did not only show sex-bias in both species, none of them showed a reversal in sex-bias; i.e., if they were female-biased in one species they were also female-biased in the other. differences in gene expression between species and populations can be extensive  <cit> . moreover, sex-biased genes are known to evolve rapidly and to reverse their sex-bias between different species  <cit> . it is therefore interesting, that the two passerine species studied here show such high similarity in the pattern of sex-biased gene expression.

nevertheless, although there were substantial the similarities in the results of the two study species, no less than  <dig> genes were sex-biased only in the zebra finch. these genes could represent hot spots for divergent selection and species-specific evolution of gene regulation on the z chromosome. they did not have a lower degree of hybridization success in the common whitethroat than genes with significant sex-bias in that species, indicating that they to a large extent represent 'true' differences between the species . moreover,  <dig> genes were identified as sex-biased only in the common whitethroat. the whitethroat samples contained the entire brain while only the telencephalon was hybridized from the zebra finches. this means that 'unique' common whitethroat genes will belong to two categories:  telencephalon species-specific genes and  genes implemented in the regulation of sex dimorphism in other parts of the brain.

male-biased genes dominated the data sets in this study, and this is similar to previous studies in birds  <cit> . the z chromosome was enriched with male-biased genes in both the zebra finch  and the common whitethroat , and in the zebra finch female-biased genes were also overrepresented on the z chromosome . this is in line with theory predicting pronounced sexual antagonism and thereby an accumulation of genes with sex-biased expression on the z chromosome   <cit> . however, as previous studies of the zebra finch and the chicken have suggested, birds seem to exhibit incomplete dosage compensation  <cit> . this has important implications for our results, both in terms of the number of male-biased genes and in terms of the similarities between the species.

dosage compensation and sexual antagonism on the z chromosome
a low degree of dosage compensation will lead to a generally higher expression of z-linked genes in males  compared to females , simply due to the double dose of z in males. it could therefore be possible that the double dose of z in avian males explains the large number of male-biased z-linked genes in our data sets. a lack of dosage compensation would make it difficult to separate between  genes that are essential to male-specific morphology and behavior and thus being up-regulated in males, and  genes that have male-biased expression due to z-linkage and a double dose in males.

there was a high proportion of male-biased z-linked genes among the sex-biased genes, and this was true for both the genes that were biased in both species , and the genes that were biased only in one of the species . this suggests that if the high degree of male-bias on the avian z chromosome is indeed centred around the extent of dosage compensation, then there are species-specific differences in which genes and parts of the z chromosome that are dosage compensated. this is highly interesting as the extent of compensation could be associated with the extent of sexual dimorphism and species differentiation. finches and warblers separated 24- <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and may have taken different routes during the evolution of sex chromosomes and dosage compensation of essential genes. it is possible, therefore, that some genes are compensated to a higher extent in one species than the other and that this pattern represents the essentiality of the genes in the respective species. hence, it can be suggested that the differences between the species, whether produced by actual sex-dimorphic regulation or by differences in the level of dosage compensation, reflect the occurrence of species-specific hot spots for the evolution of sex dimorphism in the avian brain, including hot-spots in the evolution of sex-dimorphic behaviors.

if a large proportion of the male-biased genes identified in this study are poorly compensated in females rather than specifically up-regulated by males; that leads to questions regarding detrimental effects of lower z-linked gene expression in females. aneuploidy, i.e. having a lower or higher copy number of a part of the genome, is normally lethal due to effects of gene dose on crucial networks  <cit> . in line with this, dosage compensation is wide-spread in other taxa, including mammals  <cit> . it is likely therefore that the most essential genes should show a higher degree of dosage compensation in female birds. there is some evidence that this is the case in chicken  <cit>  but more comprehensive studies are needed also in other bird species. it seems likely that low expression at hundreds of z-linked loci would have detrimental effect on the female phenotype. if that is the case, then sexual dimorphism in birds is perhaps not selected only via regulation of genes with sex-specific tasks but also via selection for different levels of dosage compensation of z-linked genes in females. it is important to notice, however, that the mean fold changes for male-biased genes in this study is not very high , hence, if a lack dosage compensation has caused sex-biased gene expression on a high number of genes on the z chromosome in these species then some compensation seems to have occurred.

another potential explanation for a large amount of sex-biased gene expression on the z chromosome relates to sexual antagonisms. if a gene is antagonistic, i.e. its expression is favorable for one sex and harmful for the other, then the sex for which it is harmful would be expected to down-regulate the expression of that gene  <cit> . this down-regulation will induce or increase sex-bias. theory predicts that antagonistic genes should aggregate on the z  chromosomes. this is due to the uneven dose of sex chromosomes between the sexes, which will lead to selection and fixation of dominant mutations in males and recessive mutations in females  <cit> . how much such antagonism contributes to sex-bias in the avian brain is difficult to say at present. however, a recent study identified quite a large number of sexually antagonistic genes on the z-chromosome in chicken  <cit> . moreover, male-biased genes belong to different functional categories than unbiased genes  <cit>  and are expressed at different levels  <cit> , indicating systematic differences between these two types of z-linked avian genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we found a high degree of sexually dimorphic gene expression in the brain of two passerine birds. given that the brain is not expected to be nearly as sexually dimorphic in gene expression as specialized tissues, like testes and ovaries, the identification of several hundreds of genes with significantly different expression between the sexes is highly interesting and implies that the avian brain is truly affected by the sex of brain cells. these and other recent results on gene expression in birds  <cit>  lead to questions concerning to what extent the pronounced sexual dimorphism in morphology and behavior in birds can be attributed to the polarization of sexually dependent gene expression in the avian brain. moreover, our results suggest that even though a very high degree of male-biased gene expression on the z chromosome is the common pattern in birds, species differ quite substantially in regard to which genes that are male-biased. the difference between the species in which genes that are dosage compensated does thereby seem to reflect differences between the species in levels of antagonism and essentiality of z-linked genes.
