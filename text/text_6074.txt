BACKGROUND
autophagy is an intracellular lysosomal degradation process, which is characterized by the formation of double-membraned autophagosomes. substantial reports have documented that ischemia-induced autophagy leads to neuronal death following ischemic stroke  <cit> . this autophagy-dependent non-apoptotic cell death is defined as autophagic cell death, or type ii programmed cell death , which is characterized by numerous autophagic vacuoles  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which ischemia-induced autophagy promotes cell death remains unclear. physiologically, autophagy is tightly modulated by regulators to prevent unbalanced activation. several regulators, particularly the bcl- <dig> family of proteins, also have a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, suggesting that the integrated regulation of autophagy and apoptosis determines cell fate  <cit> . the bcl- <dig> homologue, myeloid cell leukemia  <dig> , is an anti-apoptotic member of the bcl- <dig> family of proteins. mcl <dig> is a mitochondrial protein  <cit>  and is believed to inhibit cell death through interactions with pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family members  <cit> . furthermore, mcl <dig> also has a key role in regulation of autophagic cell death  <cit> . however, little is known about the expression profile and functions of mcl <dig> in the brain following cerebral ischemia.

in this study, we investigated the expression and cellular localization of mcl <dig> in the brains of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion  model rats. in addition, we examined the potential involvement of mcl <dig> in ischemia-induced autophagy following ischemic stroke.

RESULTS
expression of mcl <dig> in brain from mcao rats
expression levels of mcl <dig> were detected in rats subjected to 1-hour focal ischemia followed by  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours reperfusion. sparse mcl <dig> immunoreactivity was seen in the cortex and striatum of the sham-operated control rats . mcl <dig> immunoreactivity started to increase at  <dig> hours, and further increased at  <dig> hours. mcl <dig> immunoreactivity had declined at  <dig> hours after  <dig> hour mcao, but was still highly expressed . quantification confirmed that the numbers of strongly mcl <dig> immunoreactive cells were significantly higher in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum at all time points compared with the control animals . at the subcellular level, mcl <dig> was mainly localized in the cytoplasm . western blot analysis further confirmed that mcl <dig> protein levels were elevated in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and the striatum at all time points when compared with sham-operated control animals . these data indicated that mcao induced mcl <dig> expression in cortical and striatal neurons in a time-dependent manner.

cell distribution of mcl <dig> in rat brain after mcao
cell distribution of mcl <dig> expression was further investigated in ischemic brains after mcao. antibodies against neuronal nuclei , glial fibrillary acidic protein  and ox- <dig> were used to identify neurons, astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, respectively. the overwhelming majority of mcl <dig>  was labeled with neun-positive neurons  . by contrast, only a few mcl <dig> positive cells were gfap-positive astrocytes  or ox42-positive microglia/macrophages , indicating that neurons were the major cell type expressing mcl <dig> in the ischemic brain. double labeling indicated that mcl <dig> positive cells did not co-localize with caspase- <dig> positive cells in the ischemic area . furthermore, mcl1-positive cells were never positive for tunel in the ischemic area , even in the center of the lesion, where tunel-positive cells were found at all time points.

upregulation of beclin- <dig> partly contributed to cell death
beclin- <dig> immunoreactivity was weak in brains from sham-operated control rats . beclin- <dig> positive cells increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere in a time-dependent manner after cerebral ischemia. beclin- <dig> positive cells started to increase at  <dig> hours, reaching a peak at  <dig> hours and declining at  <dig> hours, but still remained highly expressed after  <dig> hour of focal cerebral ischemia . western blotting indicated that beclin- <dig> protein levels were elevated in the ipsilateral ischemic cerebral cortex and the striatum at all time points when compared with sham-operated control animals . quantification demonstrated that the numbers of beclin- <dig> immunoreactive cells and the levels of beclin- <dig> protein changed from  <dig> to  <dig> hours in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex and striatum . lc <dig> has been used as a specific marker to monitor autophagy. in the present study, almost all cells with strong punctate lc <dig> staining were labeled with beclin- <dig> . a similar expression pattern of lc <dig> and beclin- <dig> , indicated that beclin- <dig> was a major component in ischemia-induced autophagy.

in order to investigate the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis, brain sections were double-labeled with antibodies against beclin- <dig> and cleaved caspase- <dig>  the results showed that many beclin- <dig> expressing cells were negative for cleaved caspase- <dig>  whereas only a small proportion of beclin- <dig> expressing cells, particularly those located closer to the center of the lesion, were cleaved caspase- <dig> positive . semi-quantitative assessment showed that among the beclin- <dig> positive cells, approximately  <dig> % of the cells were caspase- <dig> positive in the sham group, while approximately  <dig> % at  <dig> hours,  <dig> % and  <dig> % at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours, respectively, were seen in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere . thus, the results suggested that upregulation of beclin- <dig> was partially implicated in cell death.

mcl <dig> potentially modulated beclin-1-induced autophagy
mcl <dig> is a stress sensor that regulates autophagy and the balance between autophagy and apoptosis  <cit> . many mcl <dig> positive cells also expressed beclin- <dig> at different time points . semi-quantitative assessment showed that approximately  <dig> % beclin- <dig> positive cells expressed both beclin- <dig> and mcl <dig> in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the control group. approximately  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of cells were double labeled in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours, respectively . results indicated mcl <dig> and beclin- <dig> may operate together in the same cells after ischemic reperfusion. interestingly, some beclin- <dig> expressing cells displayed the characteristic features of apoptosis including cell shrinkage and pyknotic nuclei , whereas those cells coexpressing mcl <dig> and beclin- <dig> displayed little chromatin clumping, and their nuclei were not pyknotic as demonstrated by co-labeling with dapi . the present data suggested that mcl <dig> potentially inhibited beclin-1-induced cell death.

to further explore the relationship between mcl <dig> and autophagy, rats were pretreated with 3-ma before mcao. western blot results indicated that protein expression levels of mcl <dig> were not affected after autophagy was blocked by 3-ma pretreatment . the present data suggested that mcl <dig> expression may lie upstream of autophagosome formation and potentially modulate beclin-1-induced autophagy.

discussion
mcl <dig> is a key regulator of apoptosis during central nervous system development and after dna damage  <cit> . emerging data suggest that mcl <dig> is critical for survival of different cells, whereas inhibition of mcl <dig> promotes cell death  <cit> . in the present study, caspase- <dig> positive cells were not mcl <dig> positive, while mcl <dig> positive cells were never tunel positive at all time points, suggesting that mcl <dig> was required for the survival of neural cells following ischemic insult.

autophagy has been well documented in different models of cerebral ischemia. we consistently found that autophagy, as evidenced by punctate lc <dig> staining, was significantly increased following focal cerebral ischemia. furthermore, almost all beclin-1-upregulating cells displayed punctate lc <dig> fluorescence. this observation indicated that cerebral ischemia may induce autophagy in a beclin- <dig> dependent-manner. in addition, we found that a subpopulation of beclin-1-positive cells also expressed the active form of caspase- <dig>  these results provided further evidence to demonstrate the close connection between beclin-1-dependent autophagy and cell death  <cit> . however, not all beclin- <dig> positive cells were caspase- <dig> positive, which indicated that not all the beclin- <dig> positive cells were predestined to die following stroke  <cit> . interestingly, some beclin- <dig> positive cells were also mcl <dig> positive, suggesting ischemia-induced coexpression of beclin- <dig> and mcl <dig> in some neural cells. the beclin-1/mcl <dig> positive cells had normal morphology and their nuclei were not pyknotic. more importantly, all beclin-1/mcl <dig> positive cells were not tunel negative. these results suggested that the colocalization of beclin- <dig> and mcl <dig> may favor cell survival following focal cerebral ischemia.

beclin- <dig> is essential for the initial steps of autophagy. as one component of the class iii phosphatidylinositol kinase , beclin- <dig> initiates autophagy through the interaction with the other components of the pi3k pathway. 3-ma is a relatively selective inhibitor of the class iii pi3k and has been shown to inhibit beclin-1-dependent autophagy in different disease models  <cit> . pre-administration of 3-ma consistently inhibited the conversion of lc3-i to lc3-ii in the ischemic hemisphere following mcao. however, 3-ma did not affect protein expression of mcl <dig>  suggesting that pi3k might not be involved in the regulation of the interaction between mcl <dig> and beclin- <dig>  one possible explanation is that mcl <dig> may interact with beclin- <dig> to protect against cell death beyond the pi3k complex. beclin- <dig> contains a bh <dig> domain that is sufficient and essential for binding to bcl- <dig> homologs  <cit> . the interaction of bcl- <dig> homologs with the bh <dig> domain can prevent the release of beclin- <dig>  thereby inhibiting beclin-1-dependent autophagy. by contrast, in the absence of bcl- <dig> binding, beclin- <dig> mutants induce excessive autophagy and promote cell death  <cit> . indeed, several bcl- <dig> family proteins, such as bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl, have been reported to inhibit beclin-1-dependent autophagy through the interaction with the bh <dig> domain of beclin- <dig>  given that beclin- <dig> is localized primarily within cytoplasmic structures, including the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and the perinuclear membrane, and that mcl <dig> is a mitochondrial protein  <cit> , it is highly possible that mcl <dig> may interact with beclin- <dig> via the bh <dig> domain on mitochondria to prevent ischemic cell death  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study demonstrates the expression and cellular localization of mcl <dig> in the brains of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury model rats. in addition, our findings suggest that expression of mcl <dig> is associated with the survival of neurons following ischemic stroke. mcl <dig> may inhibit cell death, at least partially through colocalization with beclin- <dig>
