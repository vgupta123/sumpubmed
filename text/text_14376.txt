BACKGROUND
alternative splicing is a key mechanism to generate functional diversity in most eukaryotic cells. its importance is underlined by the fact that it potentially affects more than 90% of human genes  <cit>  and its deregulation is frequently associated with severe diseases  <cit> . the regulation of alternative splicing has been generally thought of as being primarily controlled by the activity of splicing factors and by the elongation rate of the rna polymerase ii  <cit> . however, during the last few years it has become clear that regulation of pre-mrna splicing is more complex than initially thought and a new picture has emerged whereby various mechanisms of regulation are coupled in a network of interactions between rna, chromatin and protein factors  <cit> . the analysis of nucleosome positioning data has suggested a general role of chromatin in exon definition  <cit> , and a number of experiments have provided evidence that chromatin can interact with splicing through various ways  <cit> . one of these mechanisms involves adaptor proteins that can bridge between modified histones and splicing factors  <cit> . in a different mechanism, spliceosomal factors can influence the chromatin state and affect transcriptional activity  <cit> .

a third, non-mutually exclusive, mechanism proposes that changes in chromatin that interfere with rna polymerase ii  elongation can also affect splicing regulation  <cit> . in this context, the ccctc-binding factor , which is implicated in diverse functions related to the global organization of chromatin  <cit>  and acts as a barrier for the spreading of heterochromatin  <cit> , has been shown to be capable of stalling elongation of rnapii  <cit>  and to regulate the splicing of upstream exons with weak splice sites  <cit> . similarly, sirnas directed by the argonaute protein  to intragenic regions induce chromatin changes that alter rnapii elongation, thereby affecting splicing  <cit>  in a mechanism analogous to transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> . although the main function of argonaute proteins is traditionally described to be performed in the cytoplasm in relation to the post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism  <cit> , there is increasing evidence for a nuclear role  <cit> . in this regard, we have recently shown by chip-seq that ago <dig> binds to active transcriptional enhancers in mammalian cells and that through this binding it regulates the constitutive and alternative splicing of neighboring genes  <cit> . interestingly, the drosophila argonaute protein ago- <dig> associates with ctcf at promoters  <cit> , and its binding sites include part of the ctcf motif  <cit> . on the other hand, there is also evidence that members of the heterochromatin protein  <dig>  family have a general role in co-transcriptional rna processing and splicing  <cit> . hp <dig> is a family of non-histone proteins that recognize methylated h3k <dig>  are responsible for the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin, and associate with other non-histone proteins  <cit> . furthermore, hp <dig> proteins have been implicated in heterochromatin formation linked to ago <dig> activity in alternative splicing  <cit> . these results raise two interesting questions: whether the ctcf, ago <dig> and hp <dig> proteins associate together at the chromatin level in human cells, and whether these associations play any role in alternative splicing regulation.

to address these questions, we analyzed the combinatorial code of ago <dig>  ctcf, and hp1α together with rnapii activity as well as the histone marks h3k27me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  and total h <dig> and 5metc signals in relation to the alternative splicing differences between two cell lines, a non-tumorigenic immortalized breast epithelial cell line, mcf <dig>  and its cancer-derived counterpart, mcf <dig>  using machine learning  techniques, we uncovered the chromatin signals that associate significantly with the splicing regulation of the pre-mrna comparing these two cell lines, which leads us to describe a chromatin-based rna-map that explains nearly 70% of all the regulated alternative splicing events between the two cell lines. moreover, we find a significant association between hp1α and ctcf in relation to the alternative splicing events and a putative binding motif for hp1α.

RESULTS
association of chromatin signals with alternative splicing events
we used a splicing microarray analysis to obtain alternative splicing events  showing a significant change between mcf <dig> and mcf <dig>  from this group we selected an equal number of inclusion and skipping events  located in genes showing no change in expression . these ases will be referred to as regulated events. on the other hand, we used chip-seq data for ago <dig>  ctcf, h3k27me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  rnapii, hp1α, total h <dig> and 5metc in the same cell lines, and considered those read-clusters with a significant signal with respect to control chip-seq experiments  . for each ase, we defined  <dig> different windows , and for each window, we calculated the relative enrichment of the read densities between mcf <dig> and mcf <dig> for each one of the chip-seq experiments. this defined one attribute for each sample-window pair, with a value corresponding to the relative enrichment z-score of the chip-seq signal. we thus generated  <dig> x  <dig> =  <dig> attribute values for each alternative splicing event .figure  <dig> attributes and their correlations.  diagram of the  <dig> windows defined on exon cassette events:  <dig> nt length windows flanking exons ,  <dig> nt length regions covering  <dig> nt on either side of the exon boundaries , the entire exons  and the extent of the flanking introns . pearson correlation coefficients were calculated pairwise for the different attributes in skipping , inclusion  and non-regulated  events. the three heatmaps show in the same order those attribute pairs that have r ≥ <dig>  or r ≤− <dig>  in inclusion and/or skipping events, and involving attributes from two different experiments. correlation coefficient values are given in additional file 1: tables s1–s <dig>  the heatmaps for the pairwise correlations for all the  <dig> attributes for inclusion, skipping and non-regulated events are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 



pairwise correlation analysis of these  <dig> attributes for skipping, inclusion and non-regulated events showed significant differences between regulated and non-regulated events  , with higher correlation between attributes in regulated events compared to non-regulated events. besides the high correlations between attributes corresponding to the same chip-seq experiment in neighboring regions, we observed that the strongest correlations involved the intronic regions flanking the regulated exons. in particular, we found that h3k27me3-i <dig> versus h3k9me2-i <dig> and h3k36me3-i <dig> versus h3k27me3-i <dig> have high correlation in the three groups of events, indicating that these signals would not differentiate regulated from non-regulated events . on the other hand, there were differences in other attributes, which could potentially separate inclusion and skipping events . regulated events for which inclusion is upregulated in mcf <dig> cells compared to mcf <dig> cells  showed high correlations between histone marks on the exon-intron junctions  , between histone marks and ago <dig> on the first upstream exon-intron junction and on the second downstream exon-intron junction  and on the first exon-intron junction and downstream windows  . in contrast, in regulated events that show skipping in mcf <dig>  we found mostly high correlations between ago <dig> and rnapii , ctcf and histone modifications  and between ago <dig> and h3k27me <dig> downstream of the alternative exon  . we also found anti-correlating attributes for inclusion and skipping events: inclusion events showed mainly ago <dig> anti-correlating with histone marks and dna methylation  and hp <dig> anti-correlating with h3k27me <dig> . similarly, skipping events also showed various anti-correlation patterns . in contrast, most of these correlations did not appear in non-regulated events. the correlations and anti-correlations found in regulated events and the differences with non-regulated events suggest a cooperative role of the different chromatin signals and factors in relation to specific patterns of alternative splicing regulation.

a chromatin code of splicing regulation
in order to test a possible association of chromatin signals with the changes in splicing patterns, we built a binary classification model to separate inclusion from skipping events, selecting the predictors from the  <dig> attributes described above . to select the most informative attributes for the classification, we used a combination of feature selection methods  . this resulted in  <dig> attributes, involving seven of the chip-seq signals considered , which best separate inclusion and skipping events. among the most informative attributes, we found hp1α and ctcf downstream of the alternative exon in relation to inclusion events; and ago <dig>  h3k36me <dig> and rnapii in relation to skipping events. these attributes show significant relative differences in chromatin signal densities  between exon inclusion and skipping . in particular, we found that ago <dig> in the downstream window  associates with the direction of the splicing change, that is, splicing events with an increase of ago <dig> signal between mcf <dig> and mcf <dig> downstream of the alternative exon were more frequently associated with skipping . we also found an increase of hp1α in the downstream and upstream regions associated with inclusion . the downstream window  showed a different pattern in association with skipping for the ago <dig> signal and in association with inclusion for the hp1α signal . similarly, an increase of ctcf on the downstream intron  was related to inclusion . on the other hand, for h3k36me <dig> and rnapii we found the opposite pattern: an increase on the flanking regions of the regulated exon correlated with skipping . in contrast, the relative enrichments of these signals in a set of non-regulated exons are centered on zero and distributed between inclusion and skipping events . although 5metc was selected as informative by the feature selection procedures , the signal density around the regulated events and non-regulated events did not show clear differences . using the  <dig> most informative attributes , we used cross-validation with an alternate decision tree  classifier to obtain  <dig>  correctly labeled events   from the original  <dig> events  area  <dig> , precision  <dig> , recall  <dig> ) . moreover, using only the top features related to the ctcf, hp1α and ago <dig> signals we recover about 58% of the events correctly  . furthermore, features related to the total h <dig> signal did not provide any predictive value and normalization of the histone modifications by total h <dig> did not affect the results . our results indicate that a considerable number of alternative splicing events can be explained by the differences in the relative enrichment of histone marks and the factors ctcf, hp1α and ago <dig> .figure  <dig> chromatin-based rna-map.  each boxplot represents the relative change in signal densities as z-score values correlated with inclusion or skipping exons for the selected attributes, separated according to whether they show enrichment in skipping exons  or in inclusion exons . the plots show the kolmogorov-smirnov test p-value for the comparisons of the distributions for each attribute. the exon triplet diagram in the middle shows the regions of the selected attributes .  receiver operating characteristic  curves and precision-recall curves for the adtree model, separated for inclusion  and skipping exons . we indicate the average area under the roc curve , precision  and recall  for both classes from the 10-fold cross-validation of the model . adtree, alternate decision tree.



to provide a different view of the chromatin signals in relation to splicing regulation, we calculated the read density properties for the most informative chip-seq features, hp1α and ctcf downstream of regulated exons. in the region i <dig>  ctcf has significant density enrichment in included exons and significant depletion in skipped exons in mcf <dig> relative to mcf <dig>  compared with non-regulated exons . hp1α shows a similar enrichment and depletion pattern in the region w <dig>  but not as discriminating as with the enrichment attributes . we calculated the profiles for the ctcf and hp1α read densities for regulated exons correctly classified as skipped and included by the model, first removing those exons that overlap with the first or second exon in some transcript of the gene to avoid biases from the transcription start site . in mcf <dig>  ctcf shows a higher density downstream of inclusion events compared with skipping events . in contrast, in mcf <dig> ctcf is present at similar levels downstream of inclusion and skipped events, although at a lower density than for mcf <dig> in inclusion events . for hp1α in mcf <dig> we observed a higher density downstream of included exons compared with skipped exons , whereas it is depleted in mcf <dig> downstream of regulated exons . the patterns for inclusion events are in agreement with the proposed splicing code that predicts that an increase of ctcf or hp1α binding downstream of exons is linked to increased inclusion . on the other hand, skipping events showed a lack of co-localization of ctcf and hp1α, suggesting that the splicing modulation by ctcf, rnapii and histone marks may be strongly influenced by the presence of hp1α . the most relevant feature involving rnapii corresponds to the region w <dig>  close to the downstream exon . however, rnapii tends to localize close to regulated exons, more prominently in regions where ctcf and hp1α are present and in the direction of inclusion . in contrast, even though ago <dig> was selected as a relevant attribute in the downstream region , we did not find much difference in the ago <dig> read densities between skipping and inclusion . however, comparison of the normalized densities over the w <dig> region showed a higher signal of ago <dig> in mcf <dig> in the direction of skipping , consistent with our previous findings  <cit> . the fact that ago <dig> appears as a selected feature in the w <dig> like hp1α but in the opposite direction of regulation and with a weaker signal suggests that ago <dig> and hp1α may antagonize for a limited number of events.figure  <dig> read profiles on regulated events. density differences between mcf <dig> and mcf <dig>  measured as the log2-ratio of rpkm values  in  the i <dig> region for ctcf in skipped exons , inclusion exons  and non-regulated exons  ; and in  the region w <dig> for hp1α, in skipped exons , inclusion exons  and non-regulated exons  . profiles for hp1α and ctcf in mcf <dig>  and mcf <dig>  around 5′ splice-sites. the profiles show the mean read densities  from - <dig> bp to  <dig> bp  centered at the 5′ss of the regulated alternative exon  for both chip-seq samples, separately for skipped exons , included exons  and non-regulated exons . chip-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing; ctcf, ccctc-binding factor; hp <dig>  heterochromatin protein  <dig> 



a possible association of ctcf, hp1α and ago <dig> in splicing regulation
our results indicate a possible association between the analyzed proteins in chromatin-mediated regulation of splicing. we thus decided to further investigate this by calculating the significance of the overlap between their binding signals . interestingly, we found that there was a positive genome wide association between ctcf and hp1α, ctcf and rnapii and 5metc and hp1α . in contrast, we did not find any association of 5metc with ctcf, which agrees with their proposed antagonistic activity  <cit> . although ago <dig> was not found to be strongly associated with any other signal, we found that  <dig> % of ago <dig> clusters were overlapping with hp1α,  <dig> % with 5metc and  <dig> % with ctcf, whereas only  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these signals, respectively, were associated with ago <dig> clusters, indicating that ago <dig> may be associated specifically with ctcf and hp1α but not the other way around  . furthermore, the association of ctcf and hp1α is recapitulated at intragenic regions . this is also supported by the overlap analysis of clusters. we observed that ctcf clusters tend to localize at hp1α cluster positions and vice versa . this co-localization is recapitulated at intragenic regions . we also found an association between ctcf and rnapii downstream of the included exons  , consistent with a ctcf mediated accumulation of rnapii  <cit> .figure  <dig> association between hp1α and ctcf binding sites.  graph of significant genome-wide associations between ago <dig>  ctcf, hp1α, rnapii and 5metc binding sites. the black double arrows indicate the significant associations between hp1α and ctcf, hp1α and 5metc and ctcf and rnapii, whereas the directional gray arrows indicate the significant one-sided associations . the number beside each arrow indicates the proportion of clusters  that overlap with the sites of the factors connected by the arrow.  mean densities of hp1α clusters centered at ctcf clusters , compared with randomized hp1α clusters ; and mean densities of ctcf clusters  centered at the hp1α clusters, compared with randomized ctcf clusters . randomized clusters were calculated by relocating each cluster in an arbitrary new position in the same chromosome, avoiding satellites, gaps, pericentromeric regions and the overlap with any other random cluster. ago <dig>  argonaute  <dig> protein; ctcf, ccctc-binding factor; hp <dig>  heterochromatin protein 1; rnapii, rna polymerase ii; 5metc, 5-methycytosine.



candidate dna binding motifs for hp1α and ago1
although there is evidence for the association of ago <dig> and hp1α with chromatin  <cit> , specific candidate dna binding motifs have not been proposed before. the strong overlap of these two factors with ctcf binding sites raises the question whether ago <dig> and hp1α may have specific binding motifs. our datasets provide a good opportunity to test this hypothesis. we thus calculated enriched dna motifs in the ago <dig>  ctcf and hp1α cluster sets independently . due to the high overlap between the three samples, we assessed the enrichment of heptamers using all significant non-overlapping clusters, and built consensus motifs represented as position weight matrices  using both complementary strands . as a validation of our approach, we confirmed that the motif found for ctcf  coincided with the one previously reported  <cit> . for hp1α clusters we obtained an ac-rich motif , whereas for ago <dig> we obtained a motif with the conserved hexamer aggtca . since hp <dig> proteins bind methylated h3k <dig>  <cit> , as a further check for the hp1α motif we decided to test whether h3k9me <dig> significant clusters would give rise to a similar motif. we applied the same method and found for h3k9me <dig> a short palindromic motif that matches the consensus cwgcwg . interestingly, this motif includes cagcag and its reverse complement, which partly matches the ctcf motif  and shows a strong overlap with ctcf clusters , but not with hp1α  or ago <dig>  clusters. to further determine how specific the motifs are, we calculated the density profiles of the motifs over each set of significant chip-seq clusters. the profile of hp1α motif over the significant clusters indicates that this motif is very specific . the motif recovered for ctcf is highly enriched in ctcf clusters but also over hp1α clusters . in contrast, ago <dig> motif shows very little specificity, most likely due to the fact that there are few ago <dig> clusters that do not overlap with either hp1α or ctcf . we further tested whether hp1α or any of the motifs found were particularly enriched over h3k9me <dig> significant clusters. the ctcf motif shows the highest density over h3k9me <dig> clusters; whereas hp1α shows the lowest density . these analyses suggest that the found binding motif for hp1α may indeed be associated with its binding to dna.figure  <dig> consensus motifs for ctcf  and hp1α . motifs were built using the top  <dig> heptamers from significant ctcf and hp1α clusters . ctcf, ccctc-binding factor; hp <dig>  heterochromatin protein  <dig> 



CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have derived a chromatin code for splicing that involves binding signals for hp1α and ctcf, as well as ago <dig>  rnapii and histone marks, activity around regulated exons. feature selection and cross-validation shows that this regulatory code is predictive for nearly 70% of the alternative splicing events regulated between two cell lines, mcf <dig> and mcf <dig>  providing further evidence for a role of chromatin in the regulation of alternative splicing. this code also provides evidence for specific associations of various factors in relation to splicing differences between the two studied cell lines. our model shows that ago <dig> activity downstream of alternative exons correlates with splicing changes in the direction of skipping in mcf <dig> compared to mcf <dig>  providing further indication that ago <dig> association with chromatin could be implicated in splicing regulation  <cit> . we also recovered the previously described increased binding of ctcf binding downstream of inclusion events  <cit> . additionally, the density of rnapii downstream of regulated exons, which tends to co-occur with ctcf and hp1α, is an informative attribute to predict splicing change; and a relative increase in the region flanking the exon correlates with exon skipping in mcf <dig> compared to mcf <dig>  the association of the rnapii density related to exon definition has been observed before  <cit>  and there is much evidence supporting a regulation of alternative splicing associated with rnapii elongation rates  <cit> . our results corroborate the importance of rnapii occupancy in the exon inclusion or skipping, and provide directionality in the relation between density changes and the pattern of differential splicing between cell lines.

h3k36me <dig> also appeared as a relevant mark for splicing decisions in our model. several reports have described h3k36me <dig> as an exon marker  <cit>  and there is evidence of higher densities of h3k36me <dig> at constitutive exons compared to alternative exons  <cit> . however, the opposite pattern has also been described, as for specific genes an increased density of h3k36me <dig> has been related to exon skipping  <cit> , which agrees with our code. since we only analyzed splicing events in genes that do not change expression, our results imply that the observed changes in h3k36me <dig> signal near exon boundaries were not a consequence of gene expression, and could indeed correspond to a role in splicing.

interestingly, we found a strong association between ctcf and hp1α signals genome-wide and intragenically, and the activity of both factors correlated with exon inclusion. besides acting as insulator, ctcf is involved in the splicing regulation of some exons as an antagonist of dna methylation  <cit>  and also works as a barrier for spreading of heterochromatin  <cit> , through which it can influence rnapii elongation  <cit> . our analyses show that hp1α binding downstream of the cassette exons, with the co-localization of ctcf, affects alternative splicing. hp1α belongs to a family of non-histone chromosomal proteins and is a key player in the transcriptional gene silencing  pathway  <cit> . hp <dig> proteins have already been linked before to the regulation of splicing by chromatin  <cit> . in particular, a study published at the time we had concluded this work also describes a positional effect on splicing for hp <dig> proteins, providing further evidence of the relevance of the hp <dig> family in linking chromatin with rna processing  <cit>  and giving support to our model. the same study found that hp <dig> proteins could act as mediators between dna methylation and splicing for a subset of the regulated events  <cit> . although there have been previous reports of a relation between dna methylation and alternative splicing  <cit> , we did not find it to be a strong determinant of the splicing changes between mcf <dig> and mcf <dig> cells, indicating that the hp1-dependent code that we describe is related to a dna-methylation independent effect that may be more prevalent in the investigated cell types.

even though there is only limited evidence of direct dna-binding for hp1α  <cit> , we found a consensus motif associated with the significant hp1α chip-seq signals, which is highly specific to the significant hp1α chip-seq signals and non-overlapping with the motifs for ctcf, ago <dig> or h3k9me <dig>  hp <dig> proteins generally consist of two highly conserved domains. while one of the domains is known to bind h3k9me, the other one acts as the interaction interface with other proteins  <cit> . the two domains are separated by a hinge region of variable length, which has been related to dna and rna binding  <cit> . the found motif may be related to a sequence-specific interaction of this protein region with dna, which may act as a modulator of the interaction of hp <dig> with h3k <dig> methylation. recent analyses also provide evidence of hp <dig> proteins interacting with rna binding proteins  <cit> , highlighting their plasticity and central role in rna processing regulation linked to chromatin.

we also found a frequent overlap of ago <dig> with ctcf and hp1α clusters, but not the other way around. moreover, we found hp1α in the same downstream region as ago <dig> but in the direction of inclusion, and regulating a distinct set of events. depletion of ago <dig> expression can induce splicing changes in both directions but generally decreases splicing efficiency  <cit> . our analyses show that ago <dig> and the co-localized ctcf and hp1α produce splicing changes in opposite directions. despite the co-localization of ago <dig> with ctcf and hp1α binding sites, we found a weak but independent binding motif for ago <dig>  recent analyses have produced candidate binding motifs for drosophila  <cit>  and mouse  <cit>  argonaute proteins. however, our motif does not resemble any of these motifs, suggesting a dna-independent association of ago <dig> with chromatin  <cit> .

different models to predict the splicing outcome, also called splicing codes, have been proposed before  <cit> , but these did not include chromatin marks or proteins that interact with chromatin, such as hp <dig>  ago <dig>  ctcf and rnapii, as described here. our analyses thus complement these previous descriptions by incorporating these new determinants of alternative splicing regulation. although motifs in the pre-mrna sequence remain the main determinants of splicing regulation  <cit> , our analysis indicates that a considerable fraction may be influenced by the properties of chromatin. there have been previous attempts to establish a general relation between histone marks and splicing regulation  <cit> . however, a predictive model was proposed in only one case  <cit> . additionally, these approaches analyzed the relation between chromatin and splicing, looking at one single condition at the time, rather than comparing two conditions, and exons were classified as constitutive or alternative based on rna data from one single condition, rather than distinguishing those that are regulated from the non-regulated ones between two conditions. our approach has the advantage that, by comparing two conditions locally, it circumvents the caveats of comparing genomic regions with different sequence and structural properties. moreover, our approach relates changes of the chromatin signal between two conditions to the splicing changes of exons between the same two conditions, which provides a better descriptor of the association between chromatin changes and splicing regulation.

in summary, we have shown that a chromatin code for splicing can be defined involving hp1α, ctcf, rnapii, various histone marks and ago <dig>  which can differentiate patterns of skipping, inclusion and non-regulated exons between two conditions. additionally, the conserved motif found for hp1α and the presence of hp1α and ago <dig> in the described splicing code provides further support for their involvement in chromatin-related splicing regulation.
