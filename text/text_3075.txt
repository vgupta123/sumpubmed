BACKGROUND
the signaling molecule hedgehog  and components of its intracellular signaling pathway have been the subject of intensive research in several species from fruit fly to man during recent years. numerous developmental and morphogenic processes are controlled by the hedgehog family of proteins. much effort has been directed at identifying components of the signaling pathway and their respective roles and interactions . in drosophila, hh signaling to the transcription factor cubitus interruptus  is mediated by a protein complex consisting of ci and three other cytosolic proteins. these are the costal  <dig> , suppressor of fused ) and fused , where fu is a kinase domain containing protein with positive regulatory activities in hh induction of ci mediated transcriptional activation. hh binds to its receptor patched , a  <dig> membrane spanning protein, leading to the activation of another membrane protein smoothened   <cit> . smo is a  <dig> transmembrane protein that, by an unknown mechanism, signals to the ci containing protein complex leading to activation of ci. vertebrate homologues of these drosophila genes and proteins have been identified during the last decade. to a large extent the signaling pathway has been conserved in vertebrates. however, the picture is more complicated since some of the drosophila genes have two or more vertebrate homologues. there are three ci homologues in vertebrates, gli <dig>  gli <dig> and gli <dig>  gli <dig> has activation properties whereas gli <dig> and gli <dig> have both activation and repression activities . it is expected that the human homologue of fu  is a positive regulator of gli proteins, whereas the su homologue sufu is a negative regulator. it has been shown by several groups that sufu inhibits both gli <dig> and gli <dig> transcriptional activity and has major effects on the shuttling between cytosol and nucleus  <cit> . in a similar way it was shown in c3h/10t½ cells that fu is a positive regulator of gli <dig> but with little effect on gli <dig>  <cit> . fu is a  <dig> residue protein with high similarity to fu in the n-terminal kinase domain.

interestingly, it was discovered that mutations in ptch <dig>  the human counterpart of ptc, underlie the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome   <cit> . patients with nbccs  have developmental abnormalities and eventually develop basal cell carcinoma  and other tumors like medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma  <cit> . also smo and sufu mutations as well as overexpression of gli <dig> or gli <dig> can lead to bcc or medulloblastoma  <cit> . thus, investigations of this signaling pathway, its genes and protein components, is not only important for understanding development and morphogenesis, but also for cancer biology.

here three fu cdna clones have been identified and used for sequence analysis, identification and structural description of the fu gene, as well as for construction and subcloning of fu expression vectors. using the available public databases the fu gene was found to be present in a sequenced bac clone from chromosome  <dig>  fu is located in the same region of chromosome 2q34-q <dig> to which the human limb malformation disorder syndactyly type  <dig>  has recently been mapped in a large german pedigree  <cit>  and confirmed in an iranian family  <cit> . its possible association with this condition was investigated by sequencing the coding exons of the fu gene in an affected member from the german family  <cit> . the tissue expression pattern of fu has been determined using an rna array and northern blots. fu is expressed in all  <dig> tested tissues. it is clear that not only a single transcript is expressed. instead transcripts of different sizes are seen and some tissues apparently express more than one major transcript. from the genomic structure and the cdna clones it was possible to predict several alternative splicing events and consequently the likely expression of different protein isoforms. two of the isoforms were expressed in hek <dig> cells and tested for their ability to regulate the activity of gli <dig> and gli <dig>  showing positive effects on gli <dig> but not on gli <dig> 

RESULTS
chromosomal localization of fu
the sequence information derived from the fu cdna clones 1hfu, 2hfu and ngo <dig>  allowed the identification of the fu gene in a  <dig> kb bac clone  from chromosome  <dig>  the gene is localized to 2q <dig> at  <dig>  mb using the ensembl  <cit>  annotation. the ensembl gene prediction programs have identified most, but not all  of the fu structure and named the gene stk <dig> . chromosome 2q <dig> is the locus of several genetically based disorders. both syndactyly type  <dig>  and brachydactyly type a <dig>  have been mapped to this region  <cit> . recently, the gene responsible for bda <dig> has been identified as ihh  one of the vertebrate hh homologues  <cit> . ihh is located in the vicinity of fu on chromosome  <dig>  less than  <dig> kb away. in order to determine if alterations of fu are responsible for sd <dig>  the fu coding region  and the flanking intronic regions were sequenced using genomic dna from an affected member of an sd <dig> family whose trait maps to the 2q34-q <dig> region  <cit>  and an unrelated control individual. no fu mutations were detected in this study, although three single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. these included a t to c transition in intron  <dig>   <dig> bp 5' of exon  <dig> , causing gain of a bstni site, and a g to a transition in exon  <dig>   <dig> bp 5' of the end of the exon , causing substitution of glutamine for arginine at amino acid  <dig>  and loss of an acii site. the altered restriction sites created by these sequence changes were tested in  <dig> ceph unrelated individuals. the results showed that both changes are normal sequence variations as previously reported in the ncbi snp database. the third change was a g to a transition in exon  <dig> , causing substitution of aspartic acid for glycine at amino acid  <dig> . by sequencing exon  <dig> in  <dig> affected and  <dig> unaffected members of the sd <dig> family  <cit> , the disease variant could be observed in affected and unaffected members of the family, and a homozygous healthy individual was found. this variant has also been reported previously as a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ncbi snp database.

fu structure
none of the obtained cdna clones contain sequence from all fu exons, but they allow determination of the exon-intron organization of fu. figure  <dig> shows the structure of the fu gene. the cdna clones are outlined to account for the predicted structure. only clone 1hfu and ngo <dig> contain exons from the 5'non-coding region. to the 5' side of the sequence encoded by exon  <dig> these clones are different, indicating that alternative 5' untranslated regions  from different exons can be used. exons  <dig> to  <dig> encode the n-terminal kinase domain. none of the cdna clones encodes the fu protein that has previously been described  <cit> . 1hfu lacks the sequence encoded by exon  <dig>  which results in a frame shift and a premature termination of translation. however, it cannot be unambiguously excluded that this may encode a very short protein isoform having only a partial kinase domain. 1hfu also includes the sequence from exon  <dig>  which encodes an in frame stop codon. neither ngo <dig> nor 2hfu contain the sequence encoded by exon  <dig>  it is suggested that inclusion of exon  <dig> gives rise to a shorter protein  of  <dig> residues, encode by exons  <dig> to  <dig>  the previously described  <cit>  long form of fu  having  <dig> residues is encoded by exons  <dig> to  <dig> without inclusion of exon  <dig>  an additional alternative splice variant is suggested from the ngo <dig> clone. the first  <dig> bp of the sequence in exon  <dig> are missing. this results in a protein that is  <dig> residues shorter than l-fu . since almost all of the sequence from exon  <dig> is missing  this isoform is termed l-fuΔ <dig>  the ngo <dig> clone also contains all the  <dig> bp from intron  <dig>  but whether this represents a true alternative splice variant is doubtful.

multi tissue array and northern blot analyses
a tissue array with poly a+ rna from  <dig> human tissues was hybridized with a labeled probe 3' of the kinase domain. it was clear from this array that all examined tissues express fu to some extent. the highest amount of fu transcripts were detected in testis and pituitary . this is in agreement with the previous results by northern blotting, showing highest fu expression in testis  <cit> . this analysis revealed that most tissues express an approximately  <dig> kb transcript  <cit> . the northern blot analysis was here repeated with a larger number of tissues and a probe containing a 3' portion of the gene . figure  <dig> shows results of the three different northern blots used. here the transcripts are estimated to be a bit larger than the reported  <dig> kb, generally in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> kb. it should be emphasized that the identified cdna clones are approximately  <dig> kb and that this seems closer to the correct sizes of transcripts, though they may appear larger on the northern blots. adult skeletal muscle, thymus, spleen, liver, small intestine, placenta, lung and leukocytes show a faint  <dig>  kb band. however, the adult tissues brain, heart, colon and thyroid express a shorter transcript of  <dig> kb. adrenal seems to preferentially express a band in the  <dig>  to  <dig> kb range. in pancreas, fetal brain and fetal kidney it appears that at least two bands are expressed in the range from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. besides, mrna from fetal brain and lung also give rise to a band of much larger size around  <dig>  kb. it is not clear if this constitutes a transcript that has not been fully processed, or whether it may contain sequences from as yet unidentified exons, for instance unknown 5'utrs. fetal lung and liver clearly preferentially express transcripts of different sizes,  <dig> and  <dig> kb respectively. it is confirmed that adult testis shows the highest expression but also pancreas, kidney, fetal brain and kidney stand out, in agreement with the previously reported northern analysis  <cit> . since one major alternative splicing event seems to involve exon  <dig>  we attempted to evaluate the tissue specificity of this. a probe containing only the exon  <dig> sequence was used in hybridization of the northern blots. this resulted in smeary bands irrespective of the hybridization conditions used . a likely explanation is that the probe is too short to achieve high specificity hybridization, or perhaps the transcripts containing exon  <dig> are degraded much faster, possibly due to the process of nonsense mediated decay  <cit> .

nested pcr analyses
to examine more specifically the expression of exons that are involved in alternative splicing events, nested pcr was performed on cdna probes generated from whole tissue rna by reverse transcription. sequences containing segments including exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were amplified and analyzed on agarose gels . it was not possible to detect transcripts that lack exon  <dig> . in contrast, it appears that transcripts both with and without exon  <dig> are present . expression of transcripts without exon  <dig> is clearly most prevalent in all tissues. the expression of the longer form seems to be proportional to the expression of the shorter form. this indicates that this splicing event is not subjected to any significant tissue specific regulation. however, since a detectable amount of transcripts including exon  <dig> are present, it is likely that s-fu is also expressed in the tissues. the analysis of alternative splicing of the part encoded by exon  <dig> turned out to be difficult and several primer pairs were tested before reliable results could be obtained . interestingly, the examined tissues show very different expression patterns, suggesting that alternative splicing in this case is a regulated event. most tissues express all of exon  <dig> but in small intestine and prostate clear expression of a transcript without the  <dig> bp is observed, and in testis expression of transcripts both with and without this segment is found. sequence analysis shows that the  <dig> bp segment is likely to encode part of a leucine zipper domain and therefore a putative protein interaction may be lost in this isoform .

functional analyses of fu isoforms
investigations into the ability of fu isoforms to regulate gli transcription factors and sufu has here been initiated by expression of both l-fu and s-fu as well as 2hfu, which does not have a full kinase domain, in hek <dig> cells. the  <dig> cells, unlike the previously used c3h/10t½ cells  <cit> , do not have a complete hedgehog signaling pathway. thus, it is possible to determine if fus have direct effects on gli proteins as it was done for sufu  <cit> . the assay is based on the induction of a luciferase reporter construct having  <dig> consecutive binding elements for gli transcription factors  <cit> . in all transfection assays gli <dig> was able to induce the luciferase reporter 100– <dig> fold, whereas gli <dig> induced the reporter some 15– <dig> fold, depending on cell density and the amount of construct used. figure  <dig> shows the results of these expression analyses. as shown previously  <cit>  sufu has a strong inhibitory effect on gli <dig>  moreover, a similar strong effect was seen on gli <dig> . the results presented are typical for a large number of experiments and depend on the amount of gli and sufu that is used. in contrast to the strong effects seen with sufu, none of the fus revealed major changes . it is clear that the fus are not able to regulate gli <dig> at all, though l-fu and 2hfu have a weak  positive effect on gli <dig>  it appears that l-fu has a slightly stronger effect than 2hfu. this is qualitatively the same result as was obtained in c3h/10t½ cells, where the l-fu was also compared to a kinase-dead mutant and a  <dig> residue variant similar to s-fu. thus, in both cases there is no evidence that the kinase domain is required for the activation of gli <dig>  unlike the previous analyses  <cit> , it cannot be confirmed that fus have a direct effect on sufu function . the inhibitory effect of sufu on gli <dig> is not relieved by the addition of fu. the effect on gli2/sufu cannot be distinguished from the effect on gli <dig> alone, implying that fu does not regulate sufu but may only affect gli <dig>  since  <dig> cells lack components of the hedgehog signaling pathway, it is possible that an effect of l-fu on sufu  <cit>  requires the presence and activity of additional molecules.

discussion
the fu gene
in the present paper, the fu gene was identified and its structure determined. fu consists of  <dig> exons of which exons  <dig> and  <dig> encode 5'utrs, exon  <dig> contains the initiating atg codon and exons  <dig> and  <dig> contain in frame stop codons . exon  <dig> and  <dig> may serve as alternative first exons, like the alternative exons  <dig>  1a and 1b found in the ptch <dig> gene  <cit> . exons  <dig> to  <dig> encode the kinase domain. this segment has strong similarity to drosophila fu, whereas the remaining c-terminal part has a much weaker similarity  <cit> . using the dialign program  <cit>  it is possible to align fu to l-fu in two regions in the c-terminal part . these are largely encoded by exons 15– <dig> and 22– <dig>  this indicates that exons 10– <dig> and 17– <dig> may have been recruited to the fu gene during evolution.

investigations of syndactyly patient material
we investigated the possibility that fu underlies sd <dig> based upon the fact that fu lies within the localization interval for sd <dig> and that it is part of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, which participates in digital patterning  <cit> . although three previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, we did not detect any mutation in the fu coding region or flanking intronic regions. while these results do not implicate fu in the causation of sd <dig>  it is possible that this disorder is caused by mutations in the noncoding regions not screened in this study. alternatively, sd <dig> could be caused by a genomic rearrangement not identified by sequence analysis, although no altered bands were detected in an affected member of the sd <dig> family by southern analysis using a fu cdna clone as probe .

expression analyses
analyses of fu expression have shown that transcripts are detected in all tissues examined. for the first time evidence is presented showing that more than one transcript can be expressed from this gene. the northern blots clearly show that fu transcripts of different sizes indeed exist. here the transcripts are estimated to be slightly bigger than previously reported and in some tissues more than one transcript is evident. it is clear from the available cdnas and rt/pcr based transcript analyses that alternative splicing occurs. additionally, it is also clear that different 5'utrs are present in the transcripts. at least two protein isoforms, besides the previously described l-fu  <cit> , may be produced. the s-fu isoform is the one that most dramatically differs from l-fu, consisting only of the n-terminal one third of l-fu. s-fu expression results from inclusion of exon  <dig> in the mature transcript. this alternative splicing event was detected in all tissues examined and at an apparently constant ratio. also a case of regulated alternative splicing was detected by rt/pcr, but with a much less dramatic impact at the protein level, since it only results in the loss of  <dig> residues encoded by exon  <dig>  however, the expression reveals a possible tissue specific regulation of this alternative splicing event. this may well reflect that l-fuΔ <dig> plays a biological role different from l-fu. since it appears that the mrna for l-fuΔ <dig> is not expressed in small intestine and prostate it can be speculated that fu has a different role there, if a leucine zipper is truly lost in l-fuΔ <dig>  it is intriguing that testis appears to express transcripts both with and without the  <dig> bp segment and is also the tissue with strongest expression. perhaps the expression of l-fuΔ <dig> and l-fu together is linked to the function of desert hedgehog which has been shown to have a particular role in spermatogenesis  <cit> . whether interactions with gli proteins, sufu or other components of the signaling pathway are altered, and if this has any impact on gli or sufu activities, remains to be investigated. certainly this adds another variable to the complicated picture of hedgehog signaling and gli regulation in vertebrates.

functional investigations and perspectives
the assessment of functionality revealed that s-fu was not able to regulate gli <dig> or gli <dig> when expressed in  <dig> cells. in contrast, both l-fu and a variant lacking a full kinase domain  were able to enhance gli <dig> induced transcription. these results are qualitatively similar to those previously reported in c3h/10t½ cells  <cit> . l-fu and 2hfu were only able to enhance gli <dig> activity  <dig> to  <dig> fold in  <dig> cells, whereas  <dig> to  <dig> fold inductions are seen in c3h/10t½ cells. this may reflect the fact that the latter cell line expresses additional components of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which are required for full activity of fu. unlike the previous investigations  <cit>  it was not possible to see an effect of l-fu on sufu. again this difference may be explained by the various properties of the cell lines used. understanding the signaling events downstream of smo may reveal functional differences of the proteins involved, as compared to their fruit fly counterparts. although sufu inhibits gli transcription factors and su inhibits ci, there are still striking differences. as yet there have been no reports of a cos <dig> counterpart in vertebrates. instead it has been observed that fu interacts with all gli proteins and sufu  <cit> , even though fu does not bind to ci  <cit> . it has also been observed that both l-fu and sufu can be found in the nucleus  <cit> , which has not been observed for fu or su. it is likely that both fu and sufu are shuttled in and out of the nucleus by binding to gli proteins  <cit> . though basic activities of both fu and sufu in regulation of gli have been conserved, it also appears that significant differences from their fruit fly counterparts exist. clearly, fu is not having an effect on gli <dig> similar to the one seen on gli <dig>  additional investigations are needed in order to establish the role of fu in hedgehog signaling and gli control. the role of the different isoforms also remains to be elucidated. these have to be tested individually for their regulation of all gli proteins and proteolytic products. fu is known to have at least two separate physiological functions in the fly, one of which is dependent upon the kinase domain  <cit> . likewise, fu may well have two or more distinct functions in signaling, represented by different domains, isoforms and protein interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
fu is localized on chromosome 2q <dig> very close to ihh. though sd <dig> has been mapped to this region, we have not identified a causative role for fu in this disorder. fu consists of  <dig> exons of which  <dig> and  <dig> encode 5'utrs and  <dig> to  <dig> encode a kinase domain. for the first time it is shown that transcripts of different sizes are expressed and alternative splicing takes place, probably leading to the generation of different protein isoforms. fu protein is likely to be involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway since it can enhance the activity of gli <dig>  in contrast, it has no effect on gli <dig> and an effect on sufu cannot be observed in  <dig> cells.
