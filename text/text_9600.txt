BACKGROUND
lyme disease is a multisystemic disease caused by borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by ixodes ticks in the united states of america
 <cit> . the earliest clinical sign of lyme disease is an expanding rash at the site of tick bite known as erythema migrans
 <cit> . if left untreated, infection with lyme spirochetes can disseminate to joints, heart, skin and central nervous system
 <cit> . a resulting persistent infection of the host can then result in the development of arthritis, carditis, or neuroborreliosis
 <cit> . arthritis is the primary manifestation of late and chronic lyme disease by b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, the predominant genospecies in the united states.

the genetic basis of bacterial virulence and disease has been investigated in a large number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in the last three decades and major virulence factors of each microbe have been identified. these studies have shown that various strains of bacterial pathogens often exhibit different levels of pathogenicity and disease manifestations in the hosts. in most cases, the high pathogenicity is associated with specific variations in the set of virulence factors
 <cit> . in many microbes, the respective virulence factor-encoding genes are clustered together in specific regions defined as pathogenicity islands
 <cit> . strains of b. burgdorferi show a high variation in their ability to cause disseminated infection. since genetic studies have been developed in this spirochete only in the past decade, classification based upon its virulence factor diversity has not yet been fully developed. furthermore, the presence of a segmented genome has hampered studies with different spirochete strains. however, b. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains have been divided into different groups either on the basis of allelic variation in the outer surface protein c , which is essential for causing infection in the mammalian hosts
 <cit> , or the polymerase chain reaction  and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of  <dig> s- <dig> s rrna spacer types . furthermore, ospc or rst groups were used as markers to determine pathogenicity of different b. burgdorferi strains with only some groups considered invasive
 <cit> .

studies involving the two most widely investigated strains, b <dig> and n <dig>  have contributed significantly to the understanding of lyme disease pathogenesis and assessment of the virulence factors of b. burgdorferi <cit> . b <dig> and n <dig> strains were isolated from ixodes scapularis ticks from shelter island and westchester county of new york, respectively, and both are highly infectious in the mouse model
 <cit> . indeed, n <dig> strain was selected for its high pathogenicity from a large number of isolates recovered from ticks by durland fish. by a thorough genetic analysis of various clones of n <dig> used in various laboratories, we have recently shown that the original culture was a mixed culture and different researchers isolated two different clones independently and retained the original name, n <dig>  for both
 <cit> . the clones designated as cn <dig> and the sequenced n40b are the derivatives of the same strain and n <dig> clone d10/e <dig>  and n40c appear to be derivatives of the second strain that is different from cn40/n40b. comparative genomic analyses have indicated substantial genetic diversity between b <dig> and n40b
 <cit> . for example, n40b possesses a smaller linear chromosome and contains fewer endogenous plasmids than the b <dig> strain
 <cit> . to avoid further confusion, we will define specific n <dig> strains described above and in our recently published paper to determine their relevance to the published literature on these strains
 <cit> . genotyping by the pulsed field gel electrophoresis  method defined the b <dig> strain as pfg type b and the cn <dig> strain as pfg type e
 <cit> . in addition, the b <dig> strain belongs to the rst <dig> group while the cn <dig> strain is in the rst <dig> group
 <cit> . interestingly, a higher proportion of the b. burgdorferi strains isolated from patients with disseminated lyme disease belong to the rst <dig> group
 <cit> . therefore, several researchers have concluded that rst <dig> group b. burgdorferi strains are more infectious and pathogenic than those of other groups
 <cit> . although several strains belonging to the rst <dig> group cause disseminated infection infrequently
 <cit> , a further subclassification showed that some strains of rst3b can result in a significant disease
 <cit> . based upon comparative analyses of the selected b. burgdorferi ospc sequence and rst <dig> and rst <dig> group strains
 <cit>  it is sometimes erroneously concluded that cn <dig>  or n40d10/e <dig>  could be less virulent than the b <dig>  strain. however, numerous experimental studies have established that cn <dig> is highly pathogenic in various animal models
 <cit> . we, and others, have been studying n40d10/e <dig> for more than a decade and found that this strain is also highly virulent in the mouse model. however, a systematic comparative analysis of n <dig> strains with the sequenced b <dig> strain was not conducted to determine if both are equally pathogenic or n <dig> strains are indeed less virulent than b <dig> 

adherence is often the first step in establishment of infection by pathogenic bacteria and colonization of host tissues. lyme spirochetes are primarily extracellular, tissue tropic pathogens and are found adherent to the host cells and extracellular matrix both in the patients’ samples and mouse tissue sections, suggesting important roles played by binding mechanisms in tissue colonization. furthermore, binding to host cells is likely to be critical for b. burgdorferi facilitating selection of suitable niche for their growth and promoting colonization of the specific tissues. binding to particular tissues could then allow lyme spirochetes to escape immune system in some cases
 <cit> . indeed, a variety of host receptors and spirochetal adhesins are implicated in adherence and tissue colonization
 <cit> . glycosaminoglycans  are the most abundant ubiquitously expressed molecules on mammalian cell surfaces and as components of the extracellular matrix . they are likely to be the first molecules recognized by b. burgdorferi on the host cell surface due to initial charge-based interactions. gags are long, unbranched polysaccharide molecules consisting of disaccharide repeats of modified sugars and uronic acids
 <cit> . based on the degree of sulfation and the composition of the disaccharides, they are classified into heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate a, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate c, and keratan sulfate
 <cit> . gags are usually covalently linked to protein cores to form proteoglycans. a previous study has shown that lyme spirochetes do not recognize keratan sulfate
 <cit> . in b. burgdorferi, several adhesins recognize gags and proteoglycans. we previously identified borrelia glycosaminoglycan-binding protein , an outer membrane protein that binds heparin and dermatan sulfate, and facilitates binding of b. burgdorferi to epithelial cells and glial cells
 <cit> . in addition, the b. burgdorferi surface lipoproteins decorin-binding proteins a and b  recognize both decorin and dermatan sulfate
 <cit> . an additional adhesin, bbk <dig>  is a surface lipoprotein that can bind both fibronectin and gags to promote binding of b. burgdorferi to various mammalian cells
 <cit> . p <dig> recognizes the integral membrane integrin receptor and was first identified as an adhesin in the n40d10/e <dig> strain
 <cit>  and was also shown to express in the b <dig> strain
 <cit> . hence, multiple adherence mechanisms are present in b. burgdorferi emphasizing its importance in causing multisystemic lyme disease.

to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in b. burgdorferi tissue colonization and multisystemic disease during mammalian infection, many different types of host cell lines can be employed to investigate adherence
 <cit> . for example, vero cells, which were derived from monkey kidney epithelium
 <cit> , can be used as a representative of epithelial cells for studying gags-mediated adherence. the ea.hy <dig> cell line was derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and it has been shown to express differentiated functions that are characteristics of human vascular endothelium
 <cit> . c <dig> glioma cells were derived from rat central nervous system and were previously shown to display glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfates, on their surface
 <cit> . the t/c-28a <dig> cell line was developed from human chondrocyte cells
 <cit> , which were shown to express fibronectin, decorin and dermatan sulfate
 <cit> . we have used these cell lines to compare the differential adherence abilities of n40d10/e <dig> and b <dig> strains.

the mouse is the natural host for b. burgdorferi and the laboratory mouse model has been used to study infectivity and pathogenicity of lyme spirochetes. different strains of immunocompetent mice develop different degrees of pathology upon infection with b. burgdorferi. for example, c57bl/ <dig> mice develop mild carditis and arthritis even though colonization of the tissues is relatively similar to that of disease-susceptible c3h mice
 <cit> . arthritis development in balb/c mice is dependent upon infectious dose, where higher doses caused more severe disease
 <cit> . in contrast, c3h mice develop severe carditis and arthritis with low infectious doses
 <cit> . differential levels and types of localized cytokines production have been attributed to the disease severity in these strains of mice
 <cit> . although some laboratories use other mouse systems
 <cit> , c3h mice are ideal for discrimination of the infectivity and pathogenicity of different b. burgdorferi strains.

in this study, we assessed the presence of known critical virulence factor encoding genes in both b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains. we employed various techniques for comparative analyses of b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains to show that both spirochetes possess ability to bind to various mammalian cells in vitro, can colonize different tissues during infection and cause multisystemic disease in the immunocompetent c3h mice. interestingly, n40d10/e <dig> is more infectious than b <dig> when lower dose of inoculum is used.

RESULTS
b. burgdorferi strain b <dig> binds better to vero epithelial cells than n40d10/e9
it has been shown previously that b. burgdorferi strain n40d10/e <dig> binds efficiently to vero epithelial cells
 <cit> . a comparison of binding of the b. burgdorferi strains b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> to vero cell monolayers in vitro showed that 25% of b <dig> and 15% of n40d10/e <dig> spirochetes remained bound when the cells were mock-treated . we previously showed that heparin-related molecules mediate binding of n40d10/e <dig> strains to the vero cells
 <cit> . when the cells were treated with heparinase i to cleave heparan sulfate from the cell surface and removed by washing, the binding of b <dig> was reduced by 20%. although this binding reduction was statistically significant  as determined by t-test, decrease in binding of n40d10/e <dig> to vero cells was more pronounced with approximately 67% reduction when heparan sulfate was removed from cells by heparinase i . chondroitinase abc can cleave chondroitin sulfate a, chondroitin sulfate b , and chondroitin sulfate c
 <cit> . however, there was no significant change in the binding of either b <dig> or n40d10/e <dig> strains when the vero cells were treated with chondroitinase abc, indicating that dermatan sulfate and other chondroitin sulfates do not contribute to the binding of lyme spirochetes to these cells. since b. burgdorferi does not bind keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan
 <cit> , the remaining 80% residual binding of b <dig> and approximately 33% residual n40d10/e <dig> binding to vero cells after heparan sulfate removal indicate that both strains may also bind to the vero cells using a gag-independent pathway. the role of these mechanism is significantly higher in adherence of b <dig> to vero cells. 

attachment of b. burgdorferi strains b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> to ea.hy <dig> endothelial cells is also mediated by heparan sulfate
to study whether b. burgdorferi strains b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> exhibit a similar pattern of interaction with endothelium, these spirochete strains were allowed to bind to ea.hy <dig> endothelial cells in vitro. both strains showed lower and relatively similar levels of binding to ea.hy <dig> cells and  <dig> % of b <dig> and 8% of n40d10/e <dig> remained bound to mock-treated ea.hy <dig> cells . treatment of ea.hy <dig> cells with heparinase i significantly and almost completely eliminated binding of both strains to these endothelial cells with a remnant adherence level  equivalent to that in the empty wells control . treatment with chondroitinase abc did not affect binding of the spirochetes to the ea.hy <dig> cells relative to mock-treated endothelial cells, indicating that either ea.hy <dig> cells do not express chondroitin sulfates or these spirochete strains do not recognize chondroitin sulfates on ea.hy <dig> cells . these results agree with our previous finding that heparan sulfate is the major receptor recognized by different lyme spirochetes on ea.hy <dig> endothelial cells
 <cit> .

dermatan sulfate plays an important role in the binding of b. burgdorferi to c <dig> glioma and t/c-28a <dig> cells
when b. burgdorferi strains b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> were allowed to bind to mock-treated c <dig> glioma cells, approximately 32% of each strain of spirochetes bound to the c <dig> cells . on treatment of c <dig> glioma cells with heparinase i, binding of both strains remained unaffected as compared to mock-treated cells . both strains showed significant reduction in binding to c <dig> glioma cells after chondroitin sulfate a, chondroitin sulfate b , and chondroitin sulfate c were removed by pretreatment of these cells with chondroitinase abc . however, we have previously shown that several b. burgdorferi strains, including n40d10/e <dig>  barely recognize chondroitin sulfate a and chondroitin sulfate c
 <cit> . therefore, we conclude that the adherence of both b. burgdorferi strains to glial cells was mediated primarily by dermatan sulfate. 

similarly, binding of b <dig> to t/c-28a <dig> chondrocyte cells was reduced, by the treatment of chondroitinase abc, from 28% to 13% . n40d10/e <dig> binding was reduced from 26% to 15% . since heparinase i had no significant effect on the binding of both strains to t/c-28a <dig> cells , adherence of b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> to chondrocyte cells appeared to be mediated primarily by dermatan sulfate and receptor other than gags.

majority of the known virulence factors encoding genes of the b <dig> strain are also present in the n40d10/e <dig> strain
since the first demonstration of the essential role of ospc in mammalian infection using the genetic approach in 2004
 <cit> , several molecules have been shown to be important for causing infection and disease in the mouse model
 <cit> . the n40d10/e <dig> strain is not yet sequenced and its plasmid profile is different from the b <dig> strain
 <cit> . therefore, limited genomic and proteomic analyses were conducted to compare these two strains. to determine if these two b. burgdorferi strains show differences in the presence of genes encoding known adhesins, other virulence factors and their regulatory proteins, we amplified these genes by pcr to investigate and differentiate these two strains. interestingly, all previously established virulence factors encoding genes were present both in b31
 <cit>  and n40d10/e <dig> strains except the bbk <dig> gene . two different size pcr products were observed in b <dig> when internal vlse <dig> primers were used for gene amplification. this agrees with the presence of two homologs shown in the genome website, bbf <dig> and bbj <dig> but only bbf <dig>  is functional since bbj <dig> has a stop codon after  <dig> amino acids. however, only one vlse <dig> gene was detected in n40d10/e <dig> probably because lp <dig>  which contains bbj <dig>  is missing in this strain
 <cit> . 
 <dig>  complete genes bb <dig>  bb <dig> , bb <dig>  bb <dig>  bb <dig> , bb <dig> , bba <dig> , bba <dig> , bbd <dig>  bbd <dig>  bbe <dig> , bbg <dig>  bbh <dig> , bbj <dig> , bbk <dig> , bbu <dig>  and partial vlse <dig> gene  were amplified by pcr using b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains genomic dna as template. the bbk <dig> gene was amplified from b <dig> genomic dna, however, pcr product was not detected in the n40d10/e <dig> strain.  southern blot of ecor1-digested genomic dna of both strains  was hybridized with the probe prepared using the bbk <dig> pcr product from b <dig>  an approximately  <dig>  kb size fragment was detected only in b <dig>  as expected, but not in the n40d10/e <dig> genomic dna containing lane.

in another study, we compared two important, highly variable virulence factors of b. burgdorferi, ospc and dbpa. as expected, both of these molecules are present in both spirochete strains but showed high sequence variation
 <cit> . therefore, irrespective of the phylogenetic grouping of these strains using rst and ospc categorization, the presence of known virulence factors in both strains suggests that b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> could possibly exhibit similar levels of pathogenicity. furthermore, although bbk <dig> is an adhesin
 <cit> , previous studies showed that its absence results in a subtle infectivity defect, exhibiting disease attenuation only at low dose of infection
 <cit> .

divergence of fibronectin-binding adhesin gene bbk <dig> in n40d10/e <dig> strain
bbk <dig> could possibly contribute to the adherence-mediated tissue colonization in b <dig> as compared to n40d10/e <dig> strain but a negative pcr result is not sufficient to demonstrate this difference. since sequence divergence at the priming sites may lead to unsuccessful pcr amplification, southern hybridization was conducted to determine the presence of a homolog of bbk <dig> gene in the n40d10/e <dig> strain. absence of a band in n <dig> even under low stringency conditions  indicated that either bbk <dig> homolog in the n40d10/e <dig> strain was absent or had substantial dna sequence divergence from that in the b <dig> strain . therefore, irrespective of the presence of bbk <dig>  the two b. burgdorferi strains examined here  show similar levels of binding to most cells, indicating redundancy of function. however, bbk <dig> may contribute to the binding of lyme spirochetes to specific cell line, such as vero cells, and potentially to epithelial cells in vivo.

b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> showed remarkably different protein expression profiles
although known virulence factors are present in both b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains , they only represent the molecular profile of previously identified virulence factors and molecules associated with infectivity. therefore, it would be erroneous to conclude that they represent the full repertoire of the virulence factors of b. burgdorferi that play important roles during pathogenesis in the mammalian host. since the n40d10/e <dig> genome is not sequenced, it is possible that this strain contains additional virulence factors that play a role in lyme pathogenesis. alternatively, specific virulence factors may be expressed differentially in the two strains. to discern the differences in the protein profiles of these two strains, a comparative analysis of proteins expressed in vitro was conducted by a two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis and is shown in figures
4a and
4b. intensity of individual polypeptide spots was measured after gel electrophoresis. for each polypeptide, the relative abundance was calculated from individual spot intensity against that of all measured polypeptide spots. the polypeptides that were expressed at significantly differential levels in the two strains are summarized in table
 <dig>  out of  <dig> polypeptide spots analyzed,  <dig> were found to have at least a 10-fold increase in relative abundance in b <dig> than in n40d10/e <dig>  on the other hand,  <dig> polypeptide spots had at least a 10-fold increase in relative abundance in n40d10/e <dig> than in b <dig>  the increase in relative abundance indicated that the polypeptides could be uniquely expressed in a particular strain, or they could be severely repressed in the other strain. one or more of the proteins expressed uniquely in n40d10/e <dig> or at higher levels in this strain during infection could contribute to the higher level of infectivity and disease severity relative to dose of infection of the n40d10/e <dig> strain.

phosphoglycolate phosphatase , and hypothetical
* flagellin appears to be produced at equivalent levels in both strains but fold change depicted is higher for respective spots due to slight mobility differences of this protein in b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> gels.

to further evaluate the differences in the proteins that are differentially expressed in the two strains, a limited maldi mass spectrometric  analysis of selected protein spots was conducted. the proteins identified by maldi-ms are listed in table
 <dig>  interestingly, three protein spots of slightly different mobility, number  <dig> in b <dig> and numbers  <dig> and  <dig> in n40d10/e <dig>  were found to be more abundant  than that of the equivalent spots in the compared strain. our maldi-ms analysis  identified them as flagellin proteins. we amplified the flagellin gene  from b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains and sequenced the pcr product from the n <dig> strain. sequence analysis showed a single amino acid change resulting in slight difference in the pi of the two proteins. this could affect mobility of the flagellin of each strain slightly on a 2d gel with each appearing as more abundant protein relative to the other b. burgdorferi strain .

n40d10/e <dig> is more infectious than b <dig> in immunocompetent c3h mice
to determine if the b <dig> strain is more infectious and pathogenic than our n40d10/e <dig> strain, we used the susceptible c3h mouse infection model. by using different doses of b. burgdorferi strains injected subcutaneously into immunocompetent c3h mice, we determined the relative infectivity of each strain. two weeks after inoculation, mice were euthanized, and diameters of tibiotarsal joints measured. cultures examined microscopically from the blood, skin at the injection site, ear, joint, heart, and bladder were found to be positive from fewer tissues for the b <dig> strain than n40d10/e <dig> at a lower inoculum  and based upon these results, the calculated median infectious dose  for b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

asterisks indicate that the cultures were contaminated.

in addition to differences in the infectivity of these two strains, mice injected with b <dig> appeared to manifest less severe joint disease than those infected with n40d10/e <dig>  as evidenced by severe joint swelling exhibited by this strain at lower doses of infection . this was further confirmed by histopathological examination of the joints of the infected mice, which indicated that n40d10/e9-infected mice developed severe joint disease at the lowest infectious dose , whereas b31-infected mice primarily developed arthritis at  <dig> and higher dose of infection of b. burgdorferi per mouse. mice with joint disease had involvement of the knees as well as of the tibiotarsal joints. tibiotarsal arthritis was characterized by the presence of numerous infiltrating neutrophilic leukocytes in the periarticular tissue, tendons, ligaments, and synovial lining, which was thickened due to proliferation of synovial cells. synovial lumina contained variable numbers of exuded neutrophils .

joint swelling of each dose was quantitated by average diameter of the right tibiotarsal joint of multiple mice with each dose group. joint inflammation was scored from “-”  to “+++ ”  in the tibiotarsus for infected mice at each inoculation dose. knee or tibial crest  inflammation was recorded as “-”  to “+”  of each infected mouse.

discussion
study of infectious bacterial species involving more than one virulent strain provides a more complete picture of the pathogenesis of the organism. b <dig> and n <dig> are two of the most widely examined b. burgdorferi strains in the usa to study lyme disease pathogenesis. in  <dig>  b <dig> was the first b. burgdorferi genome that was published
 <cit> . we have recently determined that different laboratories use two different n <dig> strains under the same strain name
 <cit> . the genome of n40b was completed recently
 <cit>  but is not fully published. our n40d10/e <dig> clone derivative is not yet sequenced but our critical evaluation has indicated that these two n <dig> strains are quite different even though both of them were isolated from the same tick
 <cit> . indeed, based upon rst and ospc types, both n <dig> strains are predicted to be a much less pathogenic strain than b31
 <cit> . however, at least in one study, a higher percentage of mice infected with the sequenced n <dig> as compared to those with b <dig> strain developed myocarditis . in addition, n <dig> showed both higher level of colonization in joints and arthritic lesions than that by b <dig> strain  in the infected mice
 <cit> . such a comparative study has not been carried out with our n40d10/e <dig> strain. therefore, we conducted thorough comparative analyses both in vitro and in vivo to assess their infectivity and ability to colonize various tissues and cause disease.

b. burgdorferi strains have been shown previously to bind to various mammalian cell types in vitro and in vivo <cit> . in this study, we selected vero, ea.hy <dig>  c <dig> glioma, and t/c-28a <dig> as representatives of epithelial, vascular endothelial, glial, and chondrocyte cells to study adherence of spirochetes in vitro. with the exception of vero epithelial cells, b. burgdorferi strain b <dig> and strain n40d10/e <dig> showed approximately the same level of in vitro binding to various mammalian cells in this study. these results indicate the two most studied b. burgdorferi strains, b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig>  exhibit some differences in adherence despite sharing similar capability and mechanisms for adherence to various mammalian cells in vitro.

binding of b <dig> is significantly higher on vero cells than n40d10/e <dig>  but heparinase i treatment of these cells reduced binding of n <dig> strain much more dramatically . these results suggest that a higher expression of surface proteins in b <dig> than n40d10/e <dig> that show affinity for host receptors other than heparan sulfate may be facilitating the attachment of this strain to vero cells. indeed, our study identifies bbk <dig> as one such candidate. n40b and cn <dig> contain both lp <dig> and bbk <dig> while our n40d10/e <dig> strain lacks lp <dig>  it is possible that the bbk <dig> homolog in n40d10/e <dig> was significantly different from the bbk <dig> of b <dig> both at dna and protein level, and hence, may not carry out the same functions. this can also explain a higher level of binding of b <dig> strain to vero cells and potentially other cell lines that are not part of this study since in addition to its ability to recognize gags, bbk <dig> is also a fibronectin-binding protein
 <cit> . interestingly, the n <dig> strain with published sequence is different from our n40d10/e <dig> clone. the sequenced n <dig> contains a bbk <dig> gene, which is similar to the bbk <dig> of b <dig> with 96% identity and 97% similarity with the b <dig> protein. in another study, we have shown that lp <dig>  which contains the bbk <dig> gene in the b <dig> strain, is missing only in our n <dig> strain
 <cit> . it is likely that the bbk <dig> protein, and potentially other unidentified adhesins, may contribute to the binding of the b <dig> strain, and not of n40d10/e <dig>  bbk <dig> may recognize fibronectin as a component of the extracellular matrix of the vero cells.

a predicted higher pathogenicity of the b <dig> strain relative to the n40d10/e <dig> strain based-upon rst and ospc grouping contradicts both our results and the findings of other researchers, who have used n <dig> strains
 <cit> . thus, rst and one virulence factor  sequence comparison may be important for phylogenetic analysis but may not be suitable for drawing conclusions about the pathogenicity of a particular strain of b. burgdorferi without assessment of the virulence factors or actually conducting the experiments. however, due to development of genetic manipulation techniques for b. burgdorferi only in the last decade, the roles of only a few virulence factors have been determined, and a comprehensive analysis of multi-virulence loci of b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains is not yet possible. furthermore, a full repertoire of the virulence factors for lyme spirochetes is still not determined even on the basis of the sequence homology with genes of other pathogens since spirochetes contain most unique genes
 <cit> . finally, genetic manipulation and evaluation of mutant b. burgdorferi strains remains very time consuming and difficult. therefore, the pathogenicity of b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> cannot be determined simply by multi-virulence locus sequence typing  at present similar to that used for other pathogenic bacteria
 <cit> . therefore, we used an alternative approach to investigate the functions relevant to tissue colonization of b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains in vitro and examined their virulence in the mouse model. interestingly, even though it was possible to determine the molecular basis of adherence using the mammalian cell lines, we did not see a direct correlation of the ability of these strains to adhere to the mammalian cells in vitro and infectivity or pathogenicity in the mouse host. however, it is possible that a lower adherence of the n40d10/e <dig> strain to epithelial cells at the site of inoculation enhances its dissemination to different tissues. these findings indicated that both in vitro and in vivo complementary approaches should be used to study different aspects of host-bacterial interactions and relevant determinations made without making generalized conclusions or extrapolations.

for further molecular differentiation of these two strains that may provide a possible hint about the differences we saw in their infectivity, we used pcr to determine the presence of genes encoding known virulence factors and associated proteins identified using a genetic approach in the last decade. we also evaluated the protein profiles of b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains grown in vitro. comparison of these two gels erroneously identified flagellin gene as different protein spots. this was depicted in the table
 <dig> as >650-fold change in the level of protein relative to the other strain. maldi-ms analysis of the protein spots and sequence analysis of the n40d10/e <dig> flagellin gene were able to resolve this issue. the mobility shift of the flagellin in two gels is likely due to a single amino acid change resulting in slight difference in the pi of protein in b <dig> and n40d10/e <dig> strains. in addition to bbk <dig>  comparative 2d-protein gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a large number of proteins that were uniquely expressed in either the b <dig> or n40d10/e <dig> strain. several of these proteins have been identified. for example, the outer surface protein d  is highly expressed in b <dig> but not in n <dig>  ospd has been shown to be responsible for colonization of b. burgdorferi in the tick gut
 <cit> . however, ospd is not essential for transmission of the spirochete from tick to mouse or during the infection of the mouse
 <cit> . in the n40d10/e <dig> strain, expression of the outer surface protein c  is expressed at much higher levels compared to that in the b <dig> strain. ospc lipoprotein is required for successful early stages of mouse infection
 <cit> , and one study suggests that ospc can facilitate dissemination of b. burgdorferi during mouse infection
 <cit> . investigation of the expression of the proteins of the n40d10/e <dig> strain, which are expressed at higher levels in vitro, also in the host-adapted spirochetes may shed light on the virulence factors that contribute to the higher infectivity of the n40d10/e <dig> strain during mouse infection. these will form the foundation of future studies to identify other important virulence factors of b. burgdorferi using extensive molecular and genetic approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that n40d10/e <dig> is more infectious in c3h mouse model than b <dig> when a lower dose of inoculation is used for needle injection while both strains are highly pathogenic in this model system. our studies also indicate that phylogenetic analysis is not sufficient but a comprehensive appraisal of virulence and critical regulatory factors as well as their evaluation in vivo should be used to determine pathogenesis of a particular lyme spirochete strain. furthermore, it is suggested that multiple strains should be used to fully understand the infection and pathogenic mechanisms involved in lyme disease manifestations since some invasive strains may possess or express specific virulence factors differentially.
