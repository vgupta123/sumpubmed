BACKGROUND
androgenesis may be defined as uniparental reproduction without any genetic contribution from the maternally derived nucleus. in fish, artificial androgenesis has been induced by fertilization of genetically inactivated eggs with normal spermatozoa  <cit> . genetic inactivation of egg nucleus has typically been achieved by means of irradiating the eggs with gamma- and x-rays, but more recently it has been shown that the egg nucleus can be successfully inactivated using ultraviolet  irradiation, especially in fish with relatively smaller egg sizes  <cit> . in aquaculture, cloning, rapid fixation of genotypes and sex-control  are usually proposed by using genomes of completely homozygous doubled haploids, which are induced by chromosome duplication  at the first cleavage after the initiation of androgenetic development of haploid embryos  <cit> . duplication of chromosomes in haploids is induced by temperature or pressure shock applied at the optimum timing of the pro-metaphase of the first mitotic cell division  <cit> . homozygous clones have been produced in several fish species such as common carp  <cit> , nile tilapia  <cit> , amago salmon  <cit> , and rainbow trout  <cit> . androgenesis is also regarded as a useful approach to recover genotypes from cryopreserved sperm of unique or endangered species  <cit> . nagoya et al.  <cit>  successfully produced viable androgenetic diploid amago salmon with gamma-irradiated eggs and subsequent dispermy fertilization using fusion of spermatozoa by peg . similar attempts using induced androgenesis and fused spermatozoa or dispermy have also been reported in rainbow trout  <cit> , barb  <cit> , tetra  <cit>  and sturgeon  <cit> .

in clonally reproducing teleosts such as crucian carp and loach, a sperm nucleus that intrudes into an unreduced egg is never decondensed to form the male pronucleus, and gynogenetic development proceeds without any genetic contribution from the paternal genome  <cit> . spontaneous gynogenesis  is fairly common in lower vertebrates, including teleosts  <cit> . in contrast, spontaneous androgenetic individuals  have never been reported in vertebrates, although the phenomenon is seen in a few invertebrates including the hermaphrodite triploid clam  <cit> , stick insect  <cit>  and laboratory drosophila hybrid  <cit> . on the other hand, in a large number of artificial triploidization studies in fish, an occurrence of abnormal embryos with haploid-like external appearance has been often reported in the treatment shortly after fertilization. in experiments to produce triploid salmonids, haploid embryos were cytogenetically recognized in heat-shocked groups  <cit>  and pressure-shocked groups  <cit> . such an incidence of haploid-like progeny was also reported in experiments to induce triploidy by inhibiting the second polar body release with cold-shock treatments shortly after fertilization in stickleback  <cit> , common carp  <cit>  and loach  <cit> . although the origin of such unusual haploid-like progeny has not been well examined in these fish species, ueda and aoki  <cit>  cytogenetically confirmed one androgenetic haploid embryo out of ten diploid hybrid embryos developing from cold shock  at  <dig> min after fertilization of eggs from rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus  with sperm from acheilognathus rhombea . they suggested induction as a possible mechanism for androgenesis by temperature control of fertilized eggs. however, further studies are required since their results are from a single trial and a small sample size.

since it is difficult to achieve perfect elimination of chromosome fragments of egg nucleus in androgenetic induction by the regular method of egg irradiation with uv  <cit> , temperature shock of eggs shortly after fertilization may provide a new, easy and simple method to induce androgenesis in fish species and presumably in other vertebrate species. however, at present, treatment conditions to induce androgenesis have not been optimized in any fish species and mechanisms underlying such a temperature-induced androgenesis have not been examined yet.

in the present study, we optimized the cold-shock condition among different temperature  for  <dig> min duration just after fertilization to induce androgenetic progeny in the loach using albino color phenotype  as the paternal genetic marker. abnormal morphological characteristic  is another marker of haploid development. ploidy  was determined by dna content flow cytometry, and microsatellite genotypes were analyzed to confirm all-paternal inheritance in the putative androgenetic progeny. next, in the selected cold-shock condition at 3°c for  <dig> min duration shortly after fertilization, six crosses were conducted using orange phenotype  as the paternal color marker. in cold-shocked eggs and resultant embryos, cytological and histological observations were then performed to disclose the mechanism responsible for the initiation of androgenetic development after the cold-shock treatment.

RESULTS
cold-shock treatments and phenotypes of the resultant progeny
eggs were cold-shocked at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 9°c just after fertilization to optimize temperature conditions in the first experiments comprising five crosses . the percentages of fertilized eggs were generally high and were not significantly different among groups including control . groups cold-shocked at  <dig>   <dig>  and 6°c gave significantly lower hatching rates  when compared with control  . hatching rate  of 9°c cold-shock group was not significantly different from the control . normal wild-type with melanophores appeared in control , while cold-shock treatments resulted in the significant occurrence of the abnormal albino phenotype  , besides the dominant normal wild-type . very few normal albino fry appeared in cold-shocked groups .

as shown in figure  <dig>  most hatched larvae were normal wild-type in control  and 9°c cold-shocked group . frequencies of normal wild-type decreased in  <dig>   <dig> and 6°c cold-shocked groups. instead, abnormal wild-type larvae occurred in cold-shocked groups. high frequencies of abnormal albino fry were recorded in groups cold-shocked at 0°c  and 3°c . cold-shock at 6°c occasionally resulted in relatively lower rates of the abnormal albino . on the other hand, cold-shock at 9°c resulted in a very low percentage of albinos , if any. it must also be mentioned that in addition, a very small number of normal albino fry and abnormal albinos were seen in the cold-shocked groups  and control groups , respectively.

ploidy determination in progeny from cold-shock treatments
ploidy of normal wild-type, abnormal wild-type, normal albino and abnormal albino progeny from control and cold-shock treatments in five crosses  was assessed by flow cytometry . in the controls, all the normal wild-type progeny were diploid , whereas a few abnormal wild-type progeny contained haploid, diploid and hypodiploid progeny. a small number of abnormal albino phenotypes also appeared, but these were aneuploids with hypodiploid dna content. in normal wild-type progeny from  <dig>   <dig> and 6°c cold-shock treatments, both diploid and triploid  progeny appeared, while those from 9°c group included only diploid individuals. among the abnormal wild-type progeny from cold-shock treatments, haploid, diploid, triploid, aneuploid  and mosaic  progeny appeared. all the abnormal albino progeny that appeared in  <dig>   <dig> and 6°c cold-shock treatments were haploid , while very few normal albino progeny were diploid. consequently, cold-shock just after fertilization often resulted in androgenetic haploid development, as shown by the appearance of abnormal albino phenotypes and haploid status in the progeny. in general, a high percentage of albino phenotype  was detected from the cold-shock treatment at  <dig> to 3°c.

genetic verification of androgenesis by microsatellite genotyping
microsatellite genotyping was carried out at mac <dig> and  <dig> loci  <cit>  from normal wild-type diploid progeny from the control , abnormal albino haploid progeny , normal albino diploid progeny , normal wild-type triploid progeny , and abnormal wild type haploid progeny  developing from the cold-shocked eggs in the cross a . although maternally and paternally derived alleles were segregated in normal wild-type diploid progeny according to mendelian laws of inheritance, only paternal alleles were detected in abnormal haploid and normal diploid progeny with albino phenotype. therefore, albino progeny were concluded to be androgenotes. triploid wild-type progeny included two alleles of the mother and one allele of the father. abnormal haploid progeny with wild-type phenotype included only maternally derived alleles and thus they are concluded to be sporadic gynogenetic haploid progeny.

production of androgenetic progeny by 3°c cold-shock
using a specific condition of the cold-shock , eggs of wild-type females inseminated with sperm of orange  males were followed in the second experiment comprising six crosses . fertilization rates were not significantly different between control  and cold-shocked group  . significantly lower hatching rate  was recorded from cold-shocked group when compared to the control  . high percentage of abnormal progeny with orange phenotype  was recorded only in cold-shocked groups. in the control, most progeny  were normal exhibiting the wild-type phenotype, with a very few abnormal orange  and abnormal wild-type progeny  .

flow cytometry studies  showed that a majority of normal wild-type progeny  and abnormal wild type progeny  in the control were diploid and others were mosaics. on the other hand, both diploid  and triploid  progeny appeared in normal wild-type progeny from cold-shock treatments. abnormal wild-type progeny in cold-shock were diploid  and aneuploid . a large number of abnormal orange progeny in cold-shocked groups  and a small number of abnormal orange progeny in the control groups  were haploid except for a few aneuploids.

normal diploid progeny with wild-type phenotype in the control and abnormal haploid progeny with orange color in the cold-shocked group from the two crosses  were genotyped at three independent microsatellite loci  <cit> , mac  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . maternally and paternally derived alleles were segregated in the diploid progeny from the control, while only the paternally derived allele was detected in orange haploid progeny. these results indicate that abnormal orange progeny were androgenetic haploid developing from cold-shocked eggs.

cytological stages of dapi stained nucleus in cold-shocked embryos
dapi-stained nuclear behavior in the progeny from the control is shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  two or three condensed nuclei were observed in these embryos  <dig> min after fertilization , presumably the sperm nucleus, egg nucleus and/or second polar body nucleus . at  <dig> min af, the putative egg and sperm nucleus decondensed to form the two pronuclei , respectively , after which, the two pronuclei fused to form a decondensed pronucleus or a zygotic nucleus at  <dig> min af . at  <dig> min af, first cleavage anaphase was observed , and the nucleus became difficult to detect at  <dig> min af. however, the cleavage furrow was detected and the embryos entered into the two-cell stage at  <dig> min af .

 <dig> cytological observation could not be made.

in the cold-shock treatment one to three condensed nuclei were observed within  <dig> min af, . when compared to control embryos, these nuclei were strongly condensed and heavily stained, and two  and/or three  condensed nuclei could still be seen until  <dig> min af. a decondensed pronucleus was firstly detected at  <dig> min af, together with two condensed nuclei . at  <dig> min af, embryos with one condensed nucleus and one decondensed pronucleus were seen , along with embryos with two decondensed pronuclei  and those with only one decondensed pronuleus . anaphase of the first cleavage was detected at  <dig> min af. at  <dig> and  <dig> min af, it was difficult to observe the behavior of the nucleus, but the two-cell stage was detected at  <dig> min af .

histological observation of the nucleus in cold-shocked embryos
in control embryos, the second polar body was released at  <dig> min af , and the polar body nucleus and female  nucleus were both observed . the female nucleus was located just underneath the second polar body nucleus in the egg, and the male  nucleus was located close to female nucleus in the same egg . by  <dig> min af, the female and male pronuclei approached each other to fuse , thus revealing one or two decondensed pronuclei at this time . metaphase of the first cleavage was detected in  <dig> min af . soon thereafter, anaphase of the first cleavage was detected within  <dig> and  <dig> min af . by  <dig> min af, pro-metaphase of the second cleavage was observed , and in  <dig> min af, the embryos reached anaphase of the second cleavage .

 <dig> 1-cell with anuclear nucleus with four asters.

 <dig> 1-cell embryo with a clumped nucleus.

 <dig> second cleavage metaphase with a clumped nucleus , first cleavage metaphase with a clumped nucleus and three asters , first cleavage metaphase with a clumped nucleus and four asters , 1-cell with two decondensed pronuclei .

 <dig> second cleavage metaphase with excentric nuclear position .

in cold-shocked embryos, the second polar body was released within  <dig> min af, about  <dig> min later than the control . polar body extrusion could be categorized into four types based on histological observations:  the polar body was released and female  nucleus was located just underneath the polar body ;  the polar body was released but no female nucleus was observed in the egg ;  the irregular metaphase equator was perpendicular to the surface of egg and nuclear material distributed from the egg surface to the polar body ;  the polar body release was suppressed and the nucleus  remained in the egg . at the same time , a condensed nucleus, probably male nucleus, was also seen , and in  <dig> more minutes , a decondensed pronucleus emerged . within  <dig> min af, most embryos exhibited one decondensed pronucleus and the centriole replicated to form two asters or poles , although two decondensed pronuclei were also detected in some eggs. subsequently, in another  <dig> min , the first cleavage occurred , and by  <dig> and  <dig> min af, the first cleavage was completed resulting in two daughter nuclei . the second cleavage followed  .

besides the quasi-normal developing embryos mentioned above, various abnormal embryos were also observed in the cold-shocked group. the most frequent abnormality was seen in the form of anucler embryos , while other, less frequent, abnormalities were: a tripolar spindle configuration with a clumped nucleus and three asters , spindles with a clumped nucleus and four asters  and various other unusual embryos .

discussion
in most fish species except for salmonids, cold- or heat-shock treatment of eggs for periods ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> min after fertilization often results in duplication of maternally derived chromosomes by inhibiting the release of the second polar body. thus, gynogenetic diploid and wild-type triploid progeny occur in gynogenetically activated and normally fertilized eggs, respectively  <cit> . in the present study, both triploid and diploid wild-type progeny were also seen in the cold-shocked groups after normal fertilization. triploid wild-type progeny are presumably the result of the inhibiting the release of the second polar body by cold-shock, because some triploid progeny included two maternally derived microsatellite alleles. on the other hand, wild-type diploid progeny are considered escapees from the cold-shock treatment. gynogenetically haploid, unusual aneuploids  and mosaics  frequently appeared among abnormal wild-type progeny. these were presumed to be "side-effects" of the cold-shock treatment on cell-division and subsequent development of the eggs.

as shown by microscopic observation of dapi-stained nucleus and histological sections, the second polar body release, formation of female and male pronucleus, fusion of the two pronuclei, first cleavage and second cleavage occurred in the loach  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min after fertilization, respectively. interestingly, although our observation of the cytological processes after fertilization in the loach were essentially same in the control as previously reported  <cit> , this was not the case for the cold-shocked eggs, which were quite different in our study. during the cold-shock treatment, one, two or three condensed nuclei were observed. after the cold-shock treatment, histological investigation showed four types of second polar body extrusion.

type  <dig>  where the egg nucleus transforms to female pronucleus and then fuses with male pronucleus to form the zygotic nucleus, resulting in normal diploid progeny. the histological image of this type is equivalent to dapi-stained three condensed nuclei observed under a stereoscopic fluorescence microscope.

in type  <dig> , the egg nucleus is released from the egg together with second polar body nucleus and only the sperm nucleus remains in the egg. in other words, the polar body nucleus and the egg nucleus are both likely enclosed with the polar body and then released together. the histological image of this type is equivalent to dapi-stained two condensed nuclei.

type  <dig>  is a transition stage that disturbs the polar body release to cause complete or partial elimination of the egg nucleus. such a process gives rise to the type  <dig> category of polar body extrusion or development of aneuploid embryos.

type  <dig> is the successful result of inhibition of the second polar body release and thus the polar body nucleus and egg nucleus are both enclosed in the egg, resulting in triploid progeny after fusion with the sperm nucleus. in the controls, two decondensed nuclei, i.e. female and male pronucleus, were detected, which then fused to become one decondensed pronucleus, while in cold-shocked group, eggs with two pronuclei and those with one pronucleus were both observed at essentially the same time.

the conditions of the control clearly induce normal pronuclear fusion to form diploid or triploid progeny, while the cold-shock typically results in the existence of only the male pronucleus in the eggs, giving rise to androgenetic haploid progeny. however, the cold-shock treatment also appears to have serious side effects, giving rise to clumped nucleus, unusual polypolar spindle, and anuclear embryos. such zygotes are supposed to develop into abnormal embryos and then die. similar side effects have also been reported in the case of salmonid embryos that were manipulated to duplicate the chromosome set with heat shock  <cit>  and hydrostatic pressure shock  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
cold-shock treatment  of loach eggs for  <dig> min just after fertilization successfully induces androgenetic haploid development at relatively high frequencies among the survivors. successful induction of haploid androgenesis was verified by external morphology , flow cytometry , color phenotype  and exclusive occurrence of paternally derived alleles in microsatellite dna genotypes of the resultant progeny. the cytological mechanisms for androgenesis induced by cold-shock are explained as follows: the egg nucleus is presumably extruded together with the second polar body by the cold-shock treatment and thereby only sperm nucleus remains in the egg. sperm nucleus transforms to male pronucleus and then initiates androgenetic development .

successful induction of androgenesis by the cold-shock may open new possibilities of chromosome manipulation. the next step in this application is the production of viable diploid androgenotes . however, the mechanism by which diploid androgenotes are generated is unknown. to obtain diploid androgenotes, chromosome duplication by inducing endomitosis at an early cleavage stage  <cit>  and the use of diploid sperm  <cit>  are required to examine androgenesis after cold-shock. another extension of this work is the application of the cold-shock androgenesis technique to other fish species.
