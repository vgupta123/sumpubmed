BACKGROUND
post-translational modifications of proteins, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation or ubiquitination, have significant effects on both the structure and the function of proteins. methylation of proteins typically occurs at arginine or lysine residues, catalysed by protein arginine methyltransferases  or protein lysine methyltransferases , respectively. both families of enzymes use s-adenosyl-l-methionine  as a methyl donor to add one or more methyl groups to amines within the protein residue. such modifications alter the end use of the protein  <cit> . there are  <dig> identified members of the prmt family, including the plant specific prmt <dig>  <cit> , which are classified into four different types based on the site at which the arginine residue is methylated  <cit> . type i prmts, produce monomethyl arginines  as an intermediate and asymmetric dimethyl arginines . type ii prmts produce mmas as an intermediate and symmetric dimethyl arginines , while type iii prmts only make mmas  <cit> . type iv prmts methylate the secondary amine on the arginine and have only been described in yeast  <cit> .

prmts are well conserved throughout all eukaryotic cells and their downstream effects include altered transcription, rna processing, transport and translation, signal transduction, dna repair, chromatin structure and cellular differentiation  <cit> . defects in prmt expression have also been implicated in serious mammalian diseases  <cit> . protein targets of prmts are often histones resulting in altered gene transcription  <cit> , although many non-histone methylated proteins have been identified  <cit> . these non-histone proteins are often involved in rna binding or transcription  <cit> , but also include cytoplasmic proteins involved in various cellular developmental processes  <cit> . while these proteins have been well characterised in mammalian- and yeast-based systems, our understanding of prmt activity in regulating plant development and signalling is still developing  <cit> . in plants, type i prmts have been implicated in the alteration of transcription through the methylation of histones . these histone modifications have been found to affect flowering time, among other processes . prmts are also involved in rna processing and ribosomal biogenesis in arabidopsis . atprmt <dig>  a type ii prmt, has been found to affect pre-mrna splicing  <cit> , flowering time  <cit> , salt stress tolerance  <cit> , primary root length  <cit> , root stem cell maintenance during dna damage  <cit>  and circadian rhythms  <cit> .

the majority of prmt research in plants has involved the annual plant arabidopsis thaliana. while many genomic resources exist in arabidopsis, we were interested in annotating the prmts in a perennial tree model and characterizing their expression and effects on root formation. with a recently sequenced genome  <cit>  and the ability to manipulate it genetically, the economically important tree model e. grandis presents a useful system to study the effects of prmts in a longer-lived plant species. we found that the e. grandis genome encodes a set of seven prmts, giving it one of the smallest complements of prmts in a sequenced plant species, and that these prmts are expressed in all major plant tissues. using both chemical inhibition and transgenic modification of prmt activity in e. grandis, we explored the role of type i prmts in root growth and development. we found that transgenic repression of egprmt <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> homologues result in a similar phenotype: interruption of the normal growth and branching of plant roots. additionally, over-expression of egprmt <dig> causes abnormal root hair extension. we demonstrate that plant roots over-expressing egprmt <dig> have increased methylation of β-tubulin, which has been proposed to affect microtubule stability in neurons  <cit>  and is a likely contributor to the root hair phenotype. transcriptomic and proteomic data show that prmts act as key regulators of gene networks and pathways involved in the control of root growth and morphogenesis. given the essential role of the root system, the study of prmts will be an important avenue of research to understand not only root patterning but also other aspects of plant health and nutrition.

RESULTS
e. grandis encodes prmt-like genes that exhibit similar expression patterns in major plant tissues
by searching for the conserved functional domains common to arginine methyltransferases, seven prmt-like genes were found within the e. grandis genome . these include eucgr.c <dig>  , eucgr.g <dig>  , eucgr.b <dig>  , eucgr.d <dig>  , eucgr.j <dig>  , eucgr.d <dig>   and eucgr.c <dig>  . these e. grandis genes have been named here according to their similarity to a. thaliana prmts and will be referred to as egprmt# throughout this paper. e. grandis had the smallest number of prmt-like genes as compared to five other model plant species: arabidopsis thaliana , oryza sativa , glycine max , populus trichocarpa , and salix purpurea . leaf, stem, apical and root tissues were collected from 10 week-old e. grandis seedlings and the relative expression of seven of the prmt genes in each tissue type was determined by qpcr . all e. grandis prmt genes tested were expressed in each tissue type with egprmt <dig> being the most highly expressed followed by egprmt <dig>  two genes  exhibited the lowest expression in all tissues analyzed . in mature plants, egprmt <dig> was the most highly expressed prmt gene with egprmt <dig> and egprmt <dig> showing the lowest expression levels . in both seedlings and mature plants, each of the prmt genes showed nearly identical expression levels between the different tissues.fig.  <dig> genes homologous to arabidopsis thaliana prmts have been conserved throughout the evolution of different plant lineages. homologues of prmts encoded by a. thaliana  are found in a range of plant genomes including eucalyptus grandis ; populus trichocarpa ; oryza sativa , glycine max , and salix purpurea

e. grandis plant tissues contain a diverse set of asymmetrically dimethylated proteins
immuno-precipitation  of asymmetrically dimethylated proteins was performed using the asym <dig> antibody  and identified with mass spectrometry . the majority of methylated proteins identified via mass spectrometry have roles in cellular respiration, although a number of proteins detected have been associated with the control of root growth and branching  and in the control of defence . it should be noted that not all proteins detected in the elutions of the immuno-precipitation column had a methylated arginine residue confirmed with mass spectrometry, but would have to be either asymmetrically di-methylated, or associate with an asymmetrically di-methylated protein, based on the affinity purification with the asym <dig> antibody. proteins identified as methylated from the whole cell lysates could have been created by either type i or type ii prmts as mass spectrometry data do not allow a differentiation between symmetric and asymmetric methylation.table  <dig> list of methylated proteins found in e. grandis root or leaf tissues

chemical inhibition of prmt activity within roots alters root morphology
to determine if prmts play a role in root development, actively growing e. grandis roots were treated daily with one of three prmt chemical inhibitors  over a two-week time period. all three inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction in root growth over the first 24 h  and resulted in a reduction of detectable methylated proteins as determined by western blot using the anti-asym <dig> antibody . roots treated with the general methylation inhibitor adox and with the prmt general inhibitor ami- <dig> exhibited bulging and irregular surface morphology . roots treated with any of the three inhibitors exhibited a dense grouping of long root hairs just behind the elongation zone. microscopic analysis of the root tips following inhibitor treatment showed a significant shortening of both the size of the root meristem and the length of the root cell elongation zone  with a rounder root tip and a smaller root cap.fig.  <dig> effect of prmt methylation inhibitor treatment on root morphology. a rate of root growth of roots after 24 h of treatment with methylation inhibitors adox , ami- <dig>  and  <dig> -dimethoxynitrostyrene  or controls . b asym24 probed western blot of total protein extracted from control or prmt inhibitor treated roots. c representative photos showing the morphology of roots treated with methylation inhibitors or controls. arrows indicate abnormal root bulging observed in adox and ami- <dig> treated roots. d size of the root meristem after treatment with the highest concentration of prmt inhibitor  as compared to control treated roots . e root elongation zone size after treatment with the highest concentration of prmt inhibitor  as compared to control treated roots . ± se; * = significant difference from corresponding control treatment

transgenic roots differentially expressing prmt genes show altered growth and lateral root formation
using an agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated transformation, transgenic e. grandis roots were produced with either an overexpressing  or rnai silenced  version of the following type i prmt genes: egprmt <dig>  egprmt <dig>  egprmt <dig> and egprmt <dig> . altered expression of the transgene in roots was confirmed by qpcr. roots with elevated expression of prmt genes showed unaltered  or significantly increased  primary root length as compared to controls . as seen in roots treated to chemically inhibit prmt function, prmt rnai silenced roots were all significantly shorter than control roots. we also found that rnai silenced roots showed a significant reduction in lateral rooting per unit length. transgenic lines over-expressing the selected prmt genes exhibited normal lateral root formation . microscopic analysis of egprmt <dig> and egprmt <dig> transgenic root tips revealed that rounded root tips, as previously observed in chemically treated roots, were only observed in egprmt <dig> rnai lines . we also observed alterations in root hair morphology and density . 35s::egprmt <dig> roots had predominantly short, rounded, swollen root hairs  while 35s::egprmt <dig> had normal root hairs with only occasional rounded root hairs. the egprmt <dig> and egprmt <dig> rnai root hairs exhibited normal morphology, but appeared denser than controls . these roots also had increased pigmentation and, in the case of the egprmt <dig> rnai lines, displayed a bulbous, irregular root shape. as with the inhibitor treated roots, the meristem and expansion zones of the root tips in rnai lines were significantly shorter than in controls .fig.  <dig> effect of differential gene regulation of egprmts on root growth and lateral branching. a appearance of typical control or transformed roots either overexpressing  or underexpressing  prmt homologues. scale bar = 1 cm; b length of primary roots differentially expressing different prmt genes  averaged over all independent transformants generated. dashed line represents average length of control primary roots. c frequency of lateral root formation averaged over all independent transformants . dashed line represents average number of lateral roots per cm on control roots. ± se; * = significant difference from control

transgenic roots expressing 35s::egprmt <dig> show increased β-tubulin methylation
total protein was extracted from control and transgenic 35s::egprmt <dig> or  <dig> expressing roots. protein extraction from rnai lines was consistently unsuccessful, likely due to their small size and elevated pigmentation. asymmetrically di-methylated proteins in 35s:: lines were visualized using western blots with the asym <dig> antibody . when we analysed the western blots of protein extracted from the transgenic roots, we identified several bands that were more intense in the 35s::egprmt <dig> western blot as compared to controls. our results, when comparing multiple extractions, indicated an increase in protein methylation of proteins with molecular weight of ~ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 kda . we also observed the appearance of new methylated proteins at ~24 kda and several between  <dig> and 70 kda. the 35s::egprmt <dig> western blot showed fewer proteins with increased arginine methylation compared to the 35s::egprmt <dig> blot but some were of similar molecular weight . using these transgenic roots, we were able to identify an additional set of methylated proteins . these include another heat shock protein  and α- and β-tubulin, proteins involved in root hair and cellular growth  <cit> .fig.  <dig> western blot of un-treated e. grandis roots and roots transgenically mis-expressing egprmt <dig> and egprmt <dig>

methylation of β-tubulin by egprmt <dig> was demonstrated using immunoprecipitation and western blotting. protein extracts from control and 35s::egprmt <dig> roots were immuno-precipitated with a β-tubulin antibody and the resulting protein was visualized using western blots with both the asym <dig> and β-tubulin antibodies . the relative amount of methylated β-tubulin is, on average, 14x higher in the 35s::egprmt <dig> root sample than in the control .

discussion
we have demonstrated an important role for type i prmt homologues in the development of root tissues in e. grandis, an economically important model tree species. unlike the better studied a. thaliana, e. grandis encodes only one prmt <dig> homologue and one prmt <dig> homologue, giving it the smallest complement of prmt homologues out of the plant species considered. all seven of the identified prmt homologues in e. grandis are expressed in a similar pattern in the various plant tissues investigated, even though methylated proteins vary by tissue. this suggests that despite similar gene expression profiles, prmt substrates may vary between tissues and/or that prmt proteins are subject to a level of control beyond transcription. the activity of prmts can be modified through phosphorylation  <cit> , regulation by prmt-binding proteins  <cit>  or by automethylation  <cit> . through mass spectrometry a broad selection of proteins from both root and leaf tissue were identified as having methylated arginine residues. of these proteins, a large number are enzymes involved in photosynthesis or cellular respiration. many of these have been previously described as having methylated arginine residues in other systems  <cit> . other proteins identified  have been associated with roles in maintenance of root architecture . previous work in tomato roots identified hsp <dig> as methylated  <cit> , and α- and β- tubulin were reported to be methylated in mammalian tissues  <cit> , however methylation of 14-3- <dig> like proteins has not been previously described. it is likely that there are many more peptides and proteins methylated in e. grandis that were not detected in this study, but our results demonstrate that prmts of e. grandis appear to target regulatory proteins in a tissue-specific manner. overall, the overlap between discovered methylated proteins in our system and those previously described indicate that there is some consistency and conservation in the targets of prmts, regardless of organism.

chemical inhibitors of prmt activity caused a reduction in growth when applied to e. grandis roots. microscopic observation of the roots showed that the lack of growth in the roots may be due to a disturbance in root tip maintenance as both the meristem and elongation zones were significantly shortened. the results of the inhibitor experiments were complemented with transgenic mis-expression of type i prmts in e. grandis roots, with rnai silenced roots having both reduced growth and fewer lateral roots. previous studies in fungal model systems have demonstrated a similar effect of prmt activity on cellular extension and tissue growth, with deletions of prmt <dig> or prmt <dig> analogues resulting in significantly reduced hyphal elongation or hyphal branching, respectively  <cit> . the transcriptomic analysis presented here of roots treated with dmns – inhibiting only prmt <dig> activity - showed a large number of significantly regulated genes,  <dig> of which have proposed roles in root development, including meristem maintenance according to pfam enrichment analysis. a large number of enzymes involved in the formation of cell walls  are differentially regulated in tissues inhibited in prmt <dig> activity. this may play a role in the lack of growth seen in treated and transgenic roots. additionally, many regulated proteins are protein kinases or transcriptional regulators. therefore, we find that prmts not only methylate and change the function of important signalling molecules directly  but that they also affect the transcription of other regulatory molecules. thus prmts are likely to be positioned near the top of a signalling cascade as major regulators of cellular processes.

we found that the transgenic mis-expression of four different type i prmt genes elicited similar root phenotypes. additionally, recent work has shown that repression of prmt <dig>  in arabidopsis also results in shorter roots  <cit> . this is an argument both for and against redundancy within the prmt family as all of these prmts seem to accomplish a similar end result and yet are unable to “make up” for the loss of one another. a recent study by hernandez et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the morphological and transcriptomic phenotype of a. thaliana to the loss of either atprmt <dig> or atprmt <dig> also had significant overlaps. one reason for this could be the tendency of prmts to form homo- or hetero-dimers with each other, thus multiple prmts may be necessary for the same methylation event  <cit> . alternatively, the proper function of a protein or signalling pathway may require methylation at multiple arginine residues by separate prmts and thus the loss of any one prmt is deleterious. finally, it is probable that prmts have such a crucial role in plant processes that the loss of any one of them severely compromises the health and vitality of the plant root causing the observed short root phenotype, though this may occur via a different mechanism for each prmt homologue.

in mammalian systems, prmt <dig> is the most active arginine methyltransferase, accounting for up to 80% of asymmetric arginine methylation  <cit> , and preferentially methylates arginine residues within glycine-arginine rich  motifs  <cit> . within young e. grandis seedlings, egprmt <dig> is not the most highly expressed prmt gene although western blot analysis of 35s::egprmt <dig> root proteins shows a greater increase in methylated proteins as compared to 35s::egprmt <dig> roots. this latter result could be due to a bias of the asym <dig> antibody generated against the gar motif preferentially methylated by prmt <dig>  <cit> . arguing against this bias, however, was the finding that the majority of the peptides with methylated arginine residues identified by mass spectrometry did not encode a gar motif: only 12% of the methylated arginine residues identified had a neighbouring glycine residue. therefore, while it is possible that prmt <dig> plays a predominant role in asymmetric methylation of e. grandis proteins as has been observed in mammalian systems, it is likely that it methylates more than just gar motifs.

overexpression of egprmt <dig> results in a root hair phenotype not seen with the other e. grandis prmts studied. normal root hairs grow only from the tip in a finely balanced cooperation between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . tubulin has been found to control root morphology in arabidopsis, where reduced levels of tubulin correlated with aberrant microtubule assembly, laterally expanded root width, reduced root growth and altered root hair density and morphology  <cit> . both actin and tubulin proteins have been identified as containing methylated arginine residues in mammalian systems  <cit> . our own analysis identified α- and β-tubulin as methylated in 35s::egprmt <dig> tissues. further, immunoprecipatation and western blot analysis demonstrated a  <dig> times increase in the relative amounts of methylated β-tubulin within 35s::egprmt <dig> tissues, identifying β-tubulin as a substrate of egprmt <dig>  as increased methylation has been proposed to cause microtubule destabilisation in mammalian tissues  <cit> , it is reasonable to suggest that the over-methylation of β-tubulin in egprmt <dig> overexpressing plants could be one of the factors contributing to the abnormal root hair phenotype. additionally, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase activity is necessary for root hair initiation in arabidopsis  <cit>  and our transcriptomic data demonstrate that several xyloglucan endotransglycosylases are upregulated in inhibitor treated tissues, implicating egprmt <dig> as a repressor of their expression. thus, the observation of rounded root hairs in 35s::egprmt <dig> could occur directly, as a result of excessive methylation of cytoskeletal proteins, and/or indirectly through alteration of cellular signalling.

CONCLUSIONS
prmts are important, well-conserved proteins found in the genomes of all eukaryotic organisms described to date. eucalyptus grandis encodes its own set of seven prmt homologues that are expressed in all plant tissues and methylate a variety of proteins involved in photosynthesis, cellular respiration and signalling. investigation into the role of type i prmts in the development of e. grandis roots demonstrates a crucial role for these proteins in the growth and branching of plant roots and root hair initiation. our results concerning the impact of egprmt <dig> gene expression on root hair morphology also demonstrate that, while prmts are crucial in many cellular processes, their over-production can also have negative effects. therefore, these genes must be carefully regulated within cells. the mechanisms by which prmts alter root morphology, however, require further studies as well as an investigation into the roles of the individual plant proteins methylated by prmts and their downstream effects.
