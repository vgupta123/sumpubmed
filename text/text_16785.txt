BACKGROUND
somatostatin, also known as somatotropin release-inhibiting factor , is mainly produced by endocrine, gastrointestinal, immune, and neuronal cells, as well as by certain tumors. somatostatin is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system  and peripheral tissues in mammals  <cit> . the discovery of somatostatin receptor subtypes triggered in-depth research into their binding properties and their coupling to multiple signaling pathways. somatostatin acts via a family of g-protein-coupled receptors known as somatostatin receptors 1- <dig> , which are differentially distributed throughout the cns  <cit> . signaling through somatostatin receptors is complex and involves auto-, para-, or endocrine mechanisms  <cit> . binding of somatostatin to its receptors induces g-protein activation through various pathways, resulting in the activation of several key enzymes, including adenylyl cyclase, phosphothyrosine phosphatase  and mitogen activated protein kinase  are modulated, along with changes in the intracellular levels of calcium and potassium ions  <cit> .

studies over the last few years in mice have shown that somatostatin and its receptors appear to play an important role in cell death. in a retina ischemia model, activation of the sst <dig> receptor protected retinal neurons from damage  <cit> . additionally, studies in mice with genetic alterations of the somatostatinergic system revealed that an increased presence of functional sst <dig> receptor protected against retinal ischemia  <cit> . therefore, sst <dig> analogues might be of therapeutic benefit in retinal diseases  <cit> .

however, in contrast to the situation in the retina, less is known regarding the expression or function of somatostatin and its receptors in the inner ear. tachibana et al. reported on somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in the medial geniculate body, cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, auditory cortex, and cochlea, but did not find somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in the cochlear perilymph  <cit> . somatostatin-like immunoreactivity has also been observed in the cochlear nuclei of postnatal rats and it has been suggested that somatostatin might be important for the development of the auditory system  <cit> . in an additional study, somatostatin-producing cells were observed in the covering epithelium of the spiral prominence and in the epithelium of the intermediate and rugosal part of the endolymphatic sac  <cit> . in a recent publication from our group, we demonstrated expression of sst <dig> and sst <dig> mrna in the postnatal rat cochlea and we reported on a dose-dependent protective effect of somatostatin on gentamicin-induced hc loss in vitro  <cit> .

in the present study, we have analyzed the cochlear expression of sst <dig> and sst <dig> at both the mrna and protein level in wild-type mice, as well as in sst <dig> and sst <dig> ko mice and in cultivated neurosensory cells.

RESULTS
sst <dig> and sst <dig> mrnas are expressed in the cochlea
we performed real-time pcr to determine the quantitative gene expression of sst <dig> and sst <dig> in in the oc of 0-, 5-, 10-, 14-, and 21-day-old wild-type mice. expression of sst <dig> is significantly increased in oc explants from p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> day-old-mice compared to the expression in oc explants from p <dig> mice . as shown in figure  <dig>  sst <dig> mrna appeared to be expressed at a low level in the cochlea of p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> mice. the expression of sst <dig> in oc explants from p <dig> and p <dig> old wild-type mice is significantly increased as compared to expression in oc explants from p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> mice.

sst <dig> and sst <dig> expression in wild-type and ko mice
immunohistochemistry was performed to localize sst <dig> and sst <dig> protein in the adult mouse cochlea. cochlear tissue sections were stained with sst <dig> and sst <dig> antibodies, respectively; cell nuclei were stained blue with dapi. immunostained sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy.

cochlear sst <dig> and sst <dig> protein expression in adult mice
sst <dig> immunoreactivity was observed in outer and inner hcs, in outer and inner pillar cells, and in the spiral ganglion  . the strongest immunoreactivity was observed in the apical part of the outer and inner hcs , and weaker staining was present in the basal part of the hcs and the pillar cells. double labeling with the neurofilament marker smi <dig>  which stains axons, revealed that the axons connecting the sg with the oc do not express sst <dig>  sst <dig> immunostaining was completely absent in the sst <dig> ko mice, confirming the specificity of the antibodies used .

sst <dig> immunoreactivity was observed in the oc , namely in the inner and outer hcs, the inner and outer pillar cells, and at the membrane of deiters' cells . staining intensity appeared to be strongest in the pillar cells and deiters' cells and less strong in outer and inner hcs. smi31-positive axons from the spiral ganglion were sst2-negative . sst <dig> immunostaining was completely absent in the sst <dig> ko mice, confirming the specificity of the antibodies used .

cochlear sst <dig> protein expression in adult sst <dig> receptor ko mice
no sst <dig> antibody staining was observed in the cochlea of sst <dig> ko mice, indicating the complete absence of sst <dig> protein in this mouse model and confirming the specificity of the antibody used . sst <dig> protein  was strongly expressed in deiters' cells, and to a lesser extent in outer hcs, but was absent from pillar cells and inner hcs compared with wild-type mice . this expression pattern of sst <dig> in sst <dig> receptor ko mice was observed in all of the sections analyzed .

cochlear sst <dig> protein expression in adult sst <dig> receptor ko mice
no sst <dig> antibody staining was observed in the cochlea of sst <dig> ko mice, indicating the complete absence of sst <dig> protein in this mouse model and confirming the specificity of the antibody used . sst <dig> protein  was expressed in outer and inner hcs, as well as in supporting cells. the overall staining pattern did not differ from that of wild type mice .

sst <dig> and sst <dig> protein are expressed in oc explants
to determine whether sst <dig> and sst <dig> were expressed in oc explants prepared from postnatal mice, we double-stained oc explant tissue with phalloidin and either sst <dig> or sst <dig> antibodies . phalloidin staining reveals that the cytoarchitectonic organization of the oc is maintained, and inner hcs and the three outer layers of hcs can be identified . both sst <dig> and sst <dig> were most strongly expressed in inner hcs; however, weak immunoreactivity was also present in the outer hcs .

sst <dig> and sst <dig> protein expression in passaged neurosensory cells derived from the cochlea
immunocytochemistry was performed to localize sst <dig> and sst <dig> protein on passaged neurosensory cells from the immature cochlea. myosin vii served as a marker for hcs, and cell nuclei were stained in blue with dapi. sst <dig> and sst <dig> were detected in the myosin vii-positive neurosensory cells and were mainly localized in the perinuclear region . labeling of the plasma membrane was weak or undetectable in the cultured cells, suggesting that most receptors were not inserted into the plasma membrane.

cochlear expression of somatostatin
immunohistochemistry was performed to localize somatostatin in the adult mouse cochlea. cochlear tissue sections were stained with somatostatin antibodies. no somatostatin immunoreactivity was observed in the cells of the cochlea . the label in the tectorial membrane is likely to reflect unspecific staining. somatostatin was detected in the brain via western blotting  . in the brain sample, we observed bands at  <dig>  da,  <dig>  da ,  <dig>  da, and  <dig>   <dig> da . we were unable to detect somatostatin in protein extracts from the oc, sg, or sv. these results suggest that somatostatin is not produced in the mammalian cochlea.

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrate that the somatostatin receptors sst <dig> and sst <dig> are expressed in outer and inner hcs of the oc, as well as in defined supporting cells. we also demonstrate that in sst <dig> ko mice, sst <dig> is strongly expressed in deiters' cells and outer hcs, but not in pillar cells or inner hcs compared with wild-type mice. in contrast, in sst <dig> ko mice, the expression pattern of sst <dig> receptor is not altered compared with wild-type mice. finally, we provide evidence that somatostatin is not produced in the cochlea itself.

localization of sst <dig> and sst <dig> receptors in the inner ear
at present, very little is known about the expression of sst <dig> and sst <dig> receptors in the inner ear. our findings demonstrate that sst <dig> and sst <dig> receptor mrna is expressed in the mammalian cochlea. furthermore, we were able to localize the expression of both receptors in the cochlea using immunohistochemistry. we show that sst <dig> and sst <dig> receptors are present specifically in hcs, as well as in supporting cells of the oc of the adult mouse, with sst <dig> being more prominent in hcs and sst <dig> being more prominent in supporting cells. both receptors were present in the sg. it is noteworthy that sst <dig> and sst <dig> m rna expression increases postnatal, and peaks at p <dig>  brain stem electrical response audiometry  cannot be recorded before p12-p <dig> in mice. it might be possible that sst <dig> and sst <dig> are necessary for the growth and development of the oc but not for later maturation of hearing. the sst <dig> and sst <dig> receptor proteins are also expressed in passaged cochlear neurosensory cells derived from postnatal mouse oc. in the future, in vitro experiments such as calcium influx assays would be useful to test somatostatin function.

neuroprotective role of sst <dig> and sst <dig> receptors in the inner ear
the function of these two receptors in the oc is currently unknown. however, we have recently demonstrated that somatostatin can protect hcs from aminoglycoside toxicity in a dose-dependent manner in vitro  <cit> . it is reasonable to assume that this neuroprotective effect of somatostatin on hcs was mediated by sst <dig> or sst <dig> receptors; however, this has not yet been experimentally proven. nevertheless, our findings are consistent with a neuroprotective role for the somatostatin signaling system with respect to auditory hcs.

in contrast to the situation in the inner ear, more is known about the expression and neuroprotective role of the somatostatinergic system in the retina. it has been demonstrated that somatostatin and its receptors  are expressed in the retina, predominatly in amacrine cells and bipolar cells  <cit> . moreover, activation of the somatostatin receptor sst <dig> by somatostatin or its analogues has been shown to protect retinal neurons against ischemia-induced damage  <cit> . in addition, studies in mice with genetic alterations of the somatostatinergic system have revealed that an increased presence of functional somatostatin receptor sst <dig> protects against retinal ischemia  <cit> . therefore, sst <dig> analogues might be of therapeutic benefit in retinal diseases such as glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy, but may also protect from hearing loss due to hc degeneration and death.

what are the molecular mechanisms involved in the protection of cells from death by somatostatin and its analogues? studies in mouse retinal explants have demonstrated that the sst <dig> receptor inhibits potassium-induced glutamate release  <cit> . by limiting the amount of glutamate available to glutamate receptors, somatostatin and its analogues may exert a neuroprotective function against glutamate neurotoxicity, which characterizes many retinal diseases  <cit> . glutamate excitotoxicity appears to be mediated by the activation of caspase- <dig>  as shown in cerebrocortical neurons  <cit> . glutamate excitotoxicity is also involved in hc damage and death in the cochlea  <cit> . therefore, somatostatin may protect hcs from aminoglycoside toxicity, either by limiting glutamate release or by mitigating the toxic action of excess glutamate on hcs. in this context, it is notable that the somatostatin analogue octreotide alters the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway  <cit>  in pituitary tumor cells. we demonstrated recently that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway is involved in nf-kappab-dependent hc survival  <cit> . therefore, it might be possible that somatostatin exerts its effect on hcs through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase survival pathway.

absence of somatostatin in the cochlea
using immunohistochemistry and western blotting, we were unable to detect somatostatin within the mammalian cochlea. because we show the expression of somatostatin receptors within the cochlea, the following question arises: how can somatostatin reach its receptors? one possibility would be that somatostatin production is induced only upon excitotoxic challenge or other adverse signals. however, somatostatin immunoreactivity has been observed in the endolymphatic sac  <cit> . therefore, it might be possible that somatostatin is produced in the endolymphatic sac and reaches the cochlea through the endolymphatic duct. another possibility might be that somatostatin crosses the blood-labyrinthine barrier, and so somatostatin within the blood could reach the cochlea. it has been demonstrated that octapeptide analogs of somatostatin can cross the blood-brain barrier via a saturable transport system  <cit> . a similar transport system might be responsible for the transport of somatostatin into the cochlea via the blood-labyrinthine barrier.

sst <dig> ko mice: loss of sst <dig> receptors
in the inner ear, there is no information available on the consequences of sst <dig> receptor deletion in mice. in the cochlea of sst <dig> ko mice, sst <dig> protein was completely absent. this result is consistent with the sst <dig> gene being completely inactivated  <cit> , and confirms the specificity of the antibody used. our data demonstrate that in the mouse cochlea, sst <dig> receptor loss has a major effect on the expression of sst <dig> receptors: while in wild-type mice sst <dig> could be observed in outer hcs, inner hcs, and supporting cells , in sst <dig> ko mice the sst <dig> receptor was observed only in outer hcs and cells supporting the outer hcs, but not in pillar cells or inner hcs. notably, a similar observation has been made in the mouse retina: sst <dig> receptor loss resulted in a pronounced increase of sst <dig> receptor expression  <cit> . among other possibilities, the authors of this study speculated that the sst <dig> receptor might directly regulate sst <dig> receptor expression. our findings demonstrate prominent compensatory regulation in the mammalian cochlea as a consequence of a distinct somatostatin receptor deletion. this compensatory mechanism is subtype-specific, as it is observed only after the deletion of sst <dig>  and not after the deletion of sst <dig> 

sst <dig> ko mice: loss of sst <dig> receptors
sst <dig> protein was undetectable in the cochlea of sst <dig> ko mice. this result is in agreement with the complete inactivation of the responsible gene  <cit> , and also confirms the specificity of the antibody used. in contrast to sst <dig> ko mice, sst <dig> receptor loss has no effect on the expression of the sst <dig> receptor in the inner ear. in wild-type mice as well as in sst <dig> ko mice, the sst <dig> receptor was detected in outer and inner hcs, as well as in supporting cells. this finding is in agreement with observations in other cellular systems where no such compensatory effect was observed following the knockout of a somatostatin receptor. for example, in the brain of sst <dig> ko mice, little effect has been observed on the expression of sst <dig> and sst3- <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the presence of somatostatin receptors within the mammalian cochlea, their specific expression in the oc, and their subtype-specific compensatory regulation as a consequence of distinct somatostatin receptor deletion suggest an important role for the somatostatinergic system within the inner ear.
