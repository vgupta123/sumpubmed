BACKGROUND
glycoside hydrolases  are enzymes that hydrolyze the bond between a carbohydrate and another compound, such as a second carbohydrate, a protein, or a lipid  <cit> . the carbohydrate-active enzymes  database categorizes ghs into at least  <dig> different families, defined by sequence similarity  <cit> . gh genes are present in a wide range of organisms from archaea and bacteria to animals and plants. not surprisingly, given plants' photosynthetic capacity and their carbohydrate-rich cell walls, plants contain a relative abundance of genes for carbohydrate-active enzymes, including ghs  <cit> . although experimental characterizations of plant ghs are limited, these enzymes have been assigned a broad array of functions. they are implicated in the defense against pathogens through attacks on the carbohydrate components of microbial cell walls, the mobilization of energy reserves through the degradation of starch, and hormone signaling through the cleavage of inactivating glycosyl groups from hormone conjugates, among many other processes  <cit> . some plant ghs are thought to function in the synthesis, remodeling, and degradation of plant cell walls  <cit> . developmental events involving cell-wall loosening or degradation include cell expansion, seed germination, lateral root emergence, stomatal formation, xylem differentiation, pollen tube growth, and fruit ripening  <cit> . the recalcitrance, or resistance to degradation, of cell walls is a major obstacle to the efficient conversion of plant feedstocks into biofuels  <cit> . therefore, in addition to their roles in planta, ghs capable of modifying cell walls are also of interest for biofuel applications  <cit> .

here, we present the annotation and analysis of gh genes in the model grass species brachypodium distachyon . brachypodium is a small annual in the grass subfamily the pooideae. brachypodium's short stature; simple growth requirements; amenability to genetic transformation; and compact, sequenced genome make brachypodium a suitable research model for its less-tractable grass relatives  <cit> . members of the grass family, the poaceae, provide the majority of the world's food and feed. key crops are included in the subfamilies ehrhartoideae , panicoideae , and pooideae   <cit> . increasingly, grasses are also being exploited for fuel: species such as miscanthus  and switchgrass  are being investigated as dedicated energy crops for the production of biofuels  <cit> , and crop residues from maize, rice, and wheat may also be utilized as biomass feedstocks  <cit> . with carbohydrates as major components of grains, fodder, and cellulosic biofuel feedstocks, a better understanding of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the grasses is needed.

genome-wide analyses of gh genes have been previously published for one grass, oryza sativa   <cit> , and two dicotyledonous plants, the model species arabidopsis thaliana   <cit>  and the fast-growing tree populus trichocarpa   <cit> . comparisons between arabidopsis and rice or arabidopsis and poplar have been used to draw conclusions about the evolutionary history of ghs or differences in the gh profiles of large plant groups. for example, arabidopsis and rice gh <dig> family members were compared to estimate the number of gh <dig> genes in the common ancestor of these divergent species  <cit> . also, differences in the number of ghs between arabidopsis and rice or poplar have been hypothesized to reflect differences in the gh profiles of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants   <cit>  or herbaceous and woody plants   <cit> . the sequencing of additional plant genomes allows such comparisons to be extended to more species, increasing the robustness of the analyses by reinforcing the conclusions or by identifying over-generalizations from pairwise comparisons. to improve our understanding of plant ghs generally and grass ghs specifically, we have annotated both the brachypodium and sorghum bicolor  ghs and compared them to the ghs from rice, arabidopsis, and poplar. when significant differences between the grasses and eudicots were identified, we broadened the analysis to include ghs from other species  with significant, but variable, available sequence resources. this large-scale analysis will help guide research into this important group of enzymes.

methods
identification of brachypodium gh genes
rice and arabidopsis gh protein sequences were retrieved from the cazy database  <cit>  and used as queries in blastp searches  <cit>  of the version  <dig>  predicted proteome of brachypodium, including splice variants  <cit> . additional files  <dig> and  <dig> list rice and arabidopsis gh sequences, respectively. the e-value cut-off was set to 10- <dig>  for gh families with no known rice or arabidopsis representatives, the brachypodium predicted proteome was searched using another, usually microbial, gh sequence selected from the cazy list. using the pfam database  <cit> , each candidate brachypodium gh was analyzed for the presence of a predicted gh domain. the pfam domain predictions are listed in additional file  <dig>  to further confirm gh family assignments, brachypodium gh sequences were used as queries in tblastn searches against genbank entries, march to may,  <dig>  <cit> . each gene model was then individually examined using expressed sequence tag , illumina transcriptome, and splice-junction data, as well as predicted alternative transcripts, for brachypodium   <cit> ; relevant gene models from arabidopsis and rice   <cit> ; and pfam domain predictions, to decide whether and how a brachypodium gene model could be improved through manual modifications. the few brachypodium gh models which were modified are indicated with an "m" beside the gene name in additional file  <dig>  the modifications and modified sequences are listed in additional file  <dig> 

to search for gh genes possibly omitted from the version  <dig>  annotation, brachypodium est sequences, including sanger and  <dig> sequencing reads as well as the tau models built from illumina short reads  <cit> , were mapped onto the unmasked brachypodium genome sequence  <cit>  using blat  <cit>  with a minimum identity of 92%. only the "best match" position was selected as the genomic location for each query est sequence. gene models were then predicted using augustus  <cit> , with the genomic locations of the brachypodium ests as extrinsic evidence. the protein sequences of predicted brachypodium gene models were compared with arabidopsis  and rice genome annotations  using blastp  <cit> . for motif analysis, protein sequences were scanned for domains using blastprodom, coils, gene3d, hmmpanther, hmmpir, hmmpfam, hmmsmart, hmmtigr, fprintscan, patternscan, profilescan, and superfamily implemented in interpro  <cit> . the resulting candidate ghs were individually evaluated, as described above, for possible improvements to the gene models. the gh genes identified in this analysis of the unmasked genome are noted in additional file  <dig>  protein sequences for all the brachypodium ghs are listed in additional file  <dig> 

identification of sorghum gh genes
sorghum ghs were identified in the same way, except that rice, arabidopsis, and brachypodium gh protein sequences were used as queries in blastp searches of the sbi1_ <dig> version   <cit>  of the predicted proteome of sorghum  <cit> . in contrast to the analysis performed for brachypodium, sorghum gh gene models were not systematically evaluated for potential errors, nor did we search for gh genes not contained in the annotation. additional files  <dig> and  <dig> list the sorghum ghs and their protein sequences.

construction of phylogenetic trees
full-length gh protein sequences from arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar were used as the basis for constructing phylogenetic trees. arabidopsis and rice sequences were accessed through the cazy database  <cit> . brachypodium and sorghum gh sequences were identified in this study, and poplar gh sequences were identified via blastp searches of the version  <dig>  populus proteome   <cit> , using arabidopsis and rice gh proteins as queries. gh sequences from additional species  were later incorporated into selected trees. these additional sequences were either downloaded from the cazy database, identified by querying genbank  <cit>  from november of  <dig> through may of  <dig> with known gh sequences, or retrieved from the research literature. sequences were aligned by clustalw  <cit>  using default parameters  implemented in the mega <dig> program  <cit> . the clustalw alignments were manually examined and found to be highly accurate. thus, no manual adjustments were made except for the elimination of entire proteins that appeared to be truncated or otherwise incorrectly annotated. phylogenetic analyses were performed in mega <dig>  using the neighbor-joining method  <cit>  and  <dig>  bootstrap replicates  <cit>  for each analysis. pairwise deletion was employed to address alignment gaps and missing data.

RESULTS
identification of brachypodium and sorghum ghs
to identify candidate brachypodium ghs, blastp searches  <cit>  of the version  <dig>  brachypodium predicted proteome  <cit>  were performed using rice and arabidopsis gh sequences as queries. the resulting candidates were compared against the pfam protein families database  <cit>  to detect protein domains. brachypodium proteins without predicted gh domains were removed from consideration, with the following exceptions: one brachypodium gh <dig> and two gh <dig> members were considered to be ghs because the pfam database does not contain a specific entry for either a gh <dig> or a gh <dig> domain. in these cases, we relied on the brachypodium proteins' high sequence similarity to rice and arabidopsis family members. two of the five brachypodium gh <dig> family members lacked a significant match to a pfam gh domain but were nevertheless considered to be ghs because they are highly similar to rice and arabidopsis gh <dig> family members which also lack a predicted pfam gh domain. after modification of the gene model, one additional gene  was determined to encode a gh <dig> protein. these analyses identified  <dig> brachypodium gh genes. since the version  <dig>  annotation, based on a repeat-masked brachypodium genomic sequence, was missing genes in other families, such as the f-box family  <cit> , we also searched for brachypodium gh genes in the unmasked genome, using an annotation pipeline based on transcriptome expression evidence as well as a protein domain search. this secondary search yielded an additional  <dig> brachypodium ghs. in total,  <dig> brachypodium genes in  <dig> gh families were identified; the full list is given in additional file  <dig>  protein sequences for the brachypodium ghs are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the gene models for all of the brachypodium ghs were examined for possible improvements. of the  <dig> gh gene models,  <dig>  were modified based on criteria such as est data and gene models from other species. additional file  <dig> details the modifications and additions made to version  <dig>  of the brachypodium genome annotation. nearly 80% of the brachypodium gh genes were supported by est and/or illumina transcriptome data   <cit> . the limited changes compared to the version  <dig>  annotation and the large proportion of genes with expression support testify to the high quality of the initial genome annotation.

approximately 84% of identified brachypodium ghs had good matches  in both rice and arabidopsis . another 14% of brachypodium ghs matched both rice and arabidopsis gh sequences with an e-value ≤ 10- <dig>  only  <dig> brachypodium ghs - in the gh <dig>  gh <dig>  and gh <dig> families - were good matches to rice ghs but lacked clear arabidopsis orthologs . as discussed below, these gh <dig> and gh <dig> sequences represent major clades which are missing in arabidopsis. no brachypodium ghs were found outside the families represented in rice and arabidopsis, despite our queries using ghs from other organisms.

a similar approach was used to identify sorghum ghs: rice, arabidopsis, and brachypodium gh protein sequences were used as queries in blastp searches of the sorghum predicted proteome  <cit> , and the resulting candidates were analyzed for the presence of pfam-predicted gh domains  <cit> . sorghum was found to have  <dig> ghs in the same  <dig> families that are represented in arabidopsis, rice, and brachypodium . additional files  <dig> and  <dig> include the full list of sorghum ghs and their corresponding protein sequences.

comparisons to arabidopsis and rice ghs
to compare gh profiles across plant species, we retrieved the numbers of gh family members in both arabidopsis and rice from the cazy database  <cit> . the number of gene family members was updated as follows: one putative gh <dig> gene  was removed from the arabidopsis list, because at1g <dig> is annotated as a pseudogene in the most recent, tair <dig>  release of the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . the number of rice genes in four families was reduced because several genes were listed multiple times. the gh <dig> gene os10g <dig> was listed three times, the gh <dig> gene os08g <dig> twice, and the gh <dig> gene os01g <dig> twice. two cazy entries for the rice gh <dig> family  correspond to genes already included in the list; we therefore considered these entries to be duplicates. also, two fragmentary rice sequences  were removed from the gh <dig> and gh <dig> families, respectively.

overall, brachypodium and sorghum have similar numbers of ghs as rice and arabidopsis. the  <dig> ghs in brachypodium represent  <dig> % of the  <dig>  predicted protein-coding genes  <cit> , while the  <dig> ghs in sorghum correspond to  <dig> % of the  <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> . this is in comparison to  <dig> ghs in arabidopsis   <cit>  and  <dig> ghs in rice   <cit> .

despite the global similarity in the total number of ghs, the number of members in individual gh families varies widely. for arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, and sorghum, the number of ghs in each family is shown graphically in figure  <dig> and numerically in additional file  <dig>  some families - e.g. gh <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> - contain similar numbers of members in each of the four species. in other families - e.g. gh <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> - the number of members differs by up to four-fold . previous studies have detected some of these differences. for example, the gh <dig> family of polygalacturonases is larger in arabidopsis  than rice ; conversely, the gh <dig> family of chitinases is much larger in rice  than arabidopsis   <cit>  . however, with such pairwise comparisons of species, it has been difficult to evaluate whether differences represent variation between major groups, such as dicots and monocots, or merely between the two species examined. for many gh families, the brachypodium and sorghum data are largely consistent with those for rice. the identification of  <dig> gh <dig> members in brachypodium and  <dig> in sorghum supports the idea that grasses contain fewer polygalacturonases than eudicots do. in other cases, such as the gh <dig> family, the trend breaks down: arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, and sorghum have  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gh <dig> genes, respectively . this observation highlights the danger of making large taxonomic generalizations based on pairwise comparisons.

poplar ghs
the unusually high number of gh genes reported for poplar   <cit>  complicates global comparisons with other species; some of the poplar gene models may actually be annotation artifacts arising from the heterozygous nature of the large, complex, and duplicated poplar genome. whereas multiple rounds of computational and manual improvements have resulted in high-quality arabidopsis and rice gene models  <cit> , the sorghum and poplar models are "first drafts" derived from computational predictions, gene homology, and expression data  <cit> . future refinements of the sorghum and poplar gene models may therefore alter the number of ghs, as well as the corresponding protein sequences, in these species. in fact, while cataloging carbohydrate-active enzymes in poplar, geisler-lee et al. found that some models were fragmentary and should be merged into larger genes  <cit> .

for detailed analyses of specific gh families, poplar sequences were retrieved via blastp searches of the version  <dig>  populus proteome with arabidopsis and rice gh proteins as queries. the searches yielded non-identical, although largely overlapping, sets of poplar gh candidates. for example, poplar reportedly has  <dig> gh <dig> family members, identified via blast searches using all entries in the cazy database  <cit> . our searches of the poplar proteome using the arabidopsis gh sequences identified  <dig> poplar gh5s; searches using the rice ghs identified an additional  <dig> poplar gh <dig> proteins, for a total of  <dig>  these results are consistent with the finding of tuskan et al. that almost 12% of predicted poplar genes did not have clear orthologs in arabidopsis  <cit> .

poplar was not known to have any members in the gh <dig> and gh <dig> families  <cit> . although the gh <dig> and gh <dig> families are small, with one to two members each in arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, and sorghum , it was surprising that poplar would completely lack representatives of these families. interestingly, our searches identified one poplar gh <dig> gene  and three poplar gh <dig> genes .  the poplar gh <dig> was an especially good match - with an e-value of 10- <dig> - to the rice gh <dig>  os07g <dig>  the pfam database does not list a specific gh <dig> domain, and, correspondingly, poptr <dig> and the gh <dig> family members in arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, and sorghum do not have any significant matches to pfam gh domains. however, analyzing the poptr <dig> protein with the interproscan feature of the interpro database  <cit>  identified a sialidase domain, which is characteristic of the gh <dig> family  <cit> . the three poplar gh <dig> proteins, poptr <dig>  poptr <dig>  and poptr <dig>  were all retrieved as matches to arabidopsis and rice gh <dig> sequences, and all contain a characteristic, pfam-predicted glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> domain.

the identification of gh <dig> and gh <dig> members in poplar means that poplar has the same gh families which are present in arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, and sorghum. the presence of these families in five, diverse flowering plant species, combined with the apparent absence of plant sequences from other families, suggests that these  <dig> gh families are common to angiosperms.

phylogenetic analyses
to further elucidate the relationships between plant ghs, we selected several families for phylogenetic analyses. full-length protein sequences from five species - arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar - served as the basis for building phylogenetic trees. making the trees with full-length sequences allowed all the information contained in the protein sequences to contribute to the phylogenetic placement of the genes. to be sure that this overall evolutionary history agreed with the gh domain alone, we also constructed trees based only on the gh domains . for the gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  and gh <dig> families, the domain-only trees had the same structure as the trees based on the full-length sequences. for the gh <dig> family, the bootstrap values in the domain-only tree were too low to be informative for distinguishing the highly-similar sequences. thus, in this case, the sequence outside the gh domain was crucial for teasing out the relationship between the proteins. to enrich the investigation, sequences from other organisms were included for some of the gh families. these evolutionary analyses, performed with the mega <dig> program  <cit> , emphasize comparisons between eudicots and grasses, especially the model plants arabidopsis and brachypodium.

the gh <dig> and  <dig> families
chitin, a long-chain polymer of beta- <dig> -n-acetyl-d-glucosamine  linkages, is the second-most-abundant carbohydrate in nature after cellulose. it forms the major component of fungal cell walls and is also found in the exoskeletons of insects and shells of mollusks  <cit> . chitinases are enzymes that break down chitin by hydrolyzing this polysaccharide into simple sugars, and chitinolytic enzymes have been identified in viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoan parasites, insects, animals, and plants  <cit> . chitin is not synthesized in plants. however, expression of several plant chitinases is induced by pathogen challenge, and these proteins make up five of the seventeen families of plant pathogenesis-related  proteins: pr <dig>  pr <dig>  and pr <dig> are gh <dig> family members, and pr <dig> and pr <dig> are gh <dig> family members  <cit> . this implicates chitinases as key plant-defense proteins. numerous studies have demonstrated that chitinases have both antifungal and antibacterial activities  <cit> . environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, frost, wounding and osmotic pressure also can induce chitinase expression in plants. other studies suggest that chitinases likely play a role in growth, development, and the generation or degradation of signaling molecules  <cit> . nod factors produced by nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria include chitin oligomers of four or five n-acetyl glucosamine residues that can be cleaved and inactivated by specific plant chitinases, revealing a role for these proteins in symbiosis. it is not surprising, then, that plant genomes contain a large number of chitinase genes, the majority of which are classified in the gh <dig> and gh <dig> families. together these two families comprise  <dig> genes in brachypodium,  <dig> in sorghum,  <dig> in rice,  <dig> in arabidopsis and  <dig> in poplar .

the gh <dig> family
despite shared chitinolytic activity, the gh <dig> and gh <dig> families do not share sequence similarity. the two families are clearly distinguished by their sequences and three-dimensional structures, indicating they are derived from different ancestral genes. the gh <dig> and gh <dig> plant chitinases are further divided into seven classes  based on amino acid sequence and the presence or absence of auxiliary domains flanking a catalytic domain  <cit> . the gh <dig> family includes the class iii and class v chitinases that are more closely related to fungal enzymes involved in morphogenesis  and bacterial exochitinases  than they are to gh <dig> proteins  <cit> . the gh <dig> domain is an eight-stranded β/α barrel with a pronounced active-site cleft at the c-terminal end of the β-barrel and a conserved dxxdxdxe motif  <cit> . gh <dig> class iii chitinases can have dual lysozyme and chitinase functions, and these dual-function proteins tend to be better-targeted at murein in bacterial cell walls than the other classes of chitinases  <cit> . the gh <dig> family also includes a number of "inactivated" chitinases which represent evolutionary adaptations that recruit the ancient and stable gh <dig> scaffold to novel functions. these include gh <dig> xylanase inhibitor proteins  that lack chitinolytic activity but have adapted a new defense mechanism targeting the pathogen-produced gh <dig> and gh <dig> xylanases that degrade arabinoxylans in plant cell walls  <cit> . nodulins, involved in interactions with symbiotic bacteria, as well as narbonins and concanavalin b, seed proteins lacking conserved catalytic residues, also group within the gh <dig> family  <cit> .

a phylogenetic analysis of the gh <dig> proteins from  <dig> plant species is presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the neighbor-joining tree was generated using  <dig> bootstrap replicates and includes  <dig> monocot  and  <dig> eudicot  species. for the scientific names of species in this tree, see additional file  <dig>  sequences within this family resolve into four distinct, well-supported clades. the class v chitinases group into a single clade that shares little sequence similarity with the class iii proteins. monocot and eudicot sequences group separately within the class v clade. brachypodium and rice each have one representative in this group and sorghum has two; interestingly, class v chitinases have not been reported in maize  <cit> . compared to these monocots, the eudicots arabidopsis and poplar have greater representation in the class v clade. this is explained by local duplications resulting in expansion of class v chitinases in these species.

gh <dig> class iii chitinases are divided between the remaining three clades of the tree. initially, we aligned sequences from brachypodium, rice, sorghum, arabidopsis, and poplar, and in the analysis of these data, two clades comprised only grass sequences . these sequences were used to query the ncbi  non-redundant protein sequence database  <cit>  in order to expand the number of species represented. the retrieved proteins from both monocot and eudicot species were used in combination with the original set to construct a new tree. the majority of the retrieved eudicot sequences aligned with the sequences in the class iiia group that contains the only arabidopsis class iii protein. in this clade, the monocot and dicot sequences are mixed, rather than forming two distinct groupings as seen for the class v proteins .

the class iiib clade in figure  <dig> was proposed by suzukawa et al.   <cit>  in studies of a tulip-bulb chitinase and was also used by shoresh and harmon   <cit>  to describe a group of maize gh <dig> proteins. in our original tree, this group contained only monocot sequences; yet it is closely related to the gh <dig> narbonin and nodulin-like proteins. narbonin is a globulin protein from the eudicot vicia narbonensis that lacks conserved chitinase catalytic residues and enzymatic activity. in legumes such as fava bean and soybean, nodulins are induced in response to signals generated by symbiotic bacteria. these are eudicot species, and therefore, it was apparent that we needed to expand our dataset to get a better understanding of the proteins that cluster with the narbonin and nodulin proteins and the neighboring class iiib group. a blastp search retrieved a variety of eudicot sequences that group within the iiib clade. soresh and harmon had compared maize sequences only to rice, tulip, and arabidopsis and concluded that class iiib is monocot-specific, because the only dicot considered, arabidopsis, did not have a representative in the iiib group. our original tree included poplar, which also lacks a class iiib protein. however, the presence of several eudicot class iiib sequences in our expanded tree  illustrates the need for caution when drawing conclusions based on data from a few species. the narbonin and nodulin nucleotide sequences do not encode predicted signal peptides. in their analysis of one tulip, two rice, and three maize class iiib proteins, soresh and harmon reported that these sequences also lack signal peptides. we used signal p and sig-pred software to evaluate signal peptide predictions for the brachypodium and sorghum gh <dig> proteins and found that the bradi3g <dig>  bradi3g <dig>  and sb5g <dig> sequences in the class iiib clade lack predicted signal peptides. however, the class iiib proteins bradi3g <dig> and sb01g <dig>  as well as all of the other brachypodium and sorghum gh <dig> proteins, do contain predicted signal peptides.

the remainder of the class iii chitinases form a distinct clade that remains monocot-specific even after the addition of blastp-retrieved monocot and eudicot sequences to the phylogenetic analysis. these proteins have been grouped with the class iiia chitinases; however, they can be clearly distinguished from the class iiia chitinases by sequence and functional characteristics. this distinct clade represents a group of xylanase inhibitor proteins  that have lost chitinolytic activity and have gained the ability to inhibit the gh <dig> and gh <dig> xylanases used by pathogens to attack plant cell walls  <cit> . xips for which reports have been published, wheat xip-i and xip-iii  <cit> , wheat xip-ri and xip-rii  <cit> , and rice rixi  <cit> , are labeled in figure  <dig>  in our analysis, the clade containing these sequences is referred to as class iiia-xip. the class iiia-xip chitinases have a modified version of the dxxdxdxe motif that is required for catalytic activity. in xips, the third d is usually mutated to an aromatic residue . in addition, these proteins contain two mutations introducing r residues at positions c-terminal to the dxxdxdxe motif that can form salt bridges with the conserved e residue. this interaction blocks the chitin-binding site, preventing chitinase activity  <cit> . the sorghum and maize proteins within the clusters containing rixi, xip-ri, xip-rii, and xipi all contain the characteristic xip mutations. all of the brachypodium sequences within the class iiia-xip clade also have these changes, suggesting that they may function as xips, whereas the brachypodium class iiia and iiib sequences do not contain these mutations . bradi4g <dig> contains the two r mutations, but in place of the active site mutation, it has a large deletion through the chitin-binding domain, entirely eliminating the dxxdxdxe motif in this protein. this deletion is unique among the proteins included in the class iiia-xip clade. the cluster of the class iiia-xip clade that does not contain a brachypodium representative also appears to consist of xip proteins. most of the rice, sorghum, and maize sequences within this group have the three described xip substitutions; however, a few sequences have variations. the os05g <dig>  os05g <dig>  os05g <dig> sequences have an additional n substitution in place of the first d in the catalytic motif. os11g <dig> has an a instead of the first r, and os05g <dig>  os05g <dig>  os05g <dig> each have a k instead of the second r . the considerable number of sequences for each species represented in this clade is mainly explained by a large number of local duplications of class iiia-xip genes. the evolution of xip proteins from class iii chitinases appears to represent a successful functional adaptation specific to monocots, and, in this analysis, particularly for grasses.

the functional adaptations within the gh <dig> family highlight the challenges of assigning protein functions based solely on sequence similarities. numerous studies have been performed to identify the targets of class iii chitinases. chitinases have different substrate specificities, activities, reaction mechanisms, and expression patterns. activity and substrate specificity are diverse even among identical classes of enzymes. for example, two of the rice class iiib proteins, os10g <dig> and os10g <dig>  have highly similar sequences. yet os10g <dig> is expressed in response to pathogen challenge and has substantial antifungal activity, whereas os10g <dig> is expressed in response to environmental stresses  <cit> . through the comparison of increasing numbers of chitinase sequences, however, new groups emerge, such as the class iiia-xip proteins, and functional predictions based on sequence patterns begin to become possible.

the gh <dig> family
the gh <dig> family is found primarily in plants, but members have been identified in a number of bacteria and in nematodes  <cit> . analyses of gh <dig> proteins reveal structural similarities with lysozymes, despite a lack of significant sequence similarity, and suggest that these two enzyme groups arose from a common ancestor originating before the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . the chitinase classes represented in the gh <dig> family  are distinguished by characteristic small deletions in the sequence and by the presence of auxiliary domains flanking the main catalytic domain, including a cysteine-rich chitin-binding domain , a proline- and glycine-rich hinge region, and a carboxy-terminal extension   <cit> .

a phylogenetic analysis of the gh <dig> proteins from five plant species is presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the neighbor-joining tree includes three grass  and two eudicot  species. the sequences within this family are resolved into four distinct, well-supported clades . we used the designated chitinase classes for the arabidopsis gh <dig> proteins  <cit>  and the sequence alignment generated for this tree to assign chitinase classes to brachypodium proteins with similar arrangements of auxiliary domains and deletion patterns. class designations for the brachypodium and arabidopsis sequences are indicated by roman numerals within figure  <dig>  three of the clades contain sequences primarily from a single chitinase class, ii, iv, or vi, whereas one clade contains sequences mixed between classes i and ii. sequences for classes i and ii, although similar, are distinguished by the absence of the crd and the cte and a small deletion in the catalytic domain in the class ii proteins. placement in previous phylogenetic analyses also suggests that class ii proteins have polyphyletic origins, arising multiple times within class i lineages  <cit> . two of the brachypodium sequences in this clade have notable differences from the classic representatives of their assigned classes. bradi2g <dig> has a large crd containing  <dig> cysteine residues, twice the usual number, and may represent two tandem crds. bradi1g <dig> looks like a class ii protein but lacks the signal peptide usually found in this class. one class vii protein, at3g <dig>  resides within the class iv clade. in addition to the two deletions in the catalytic domain that are characteristic of the class iv proteins, this protein also lacks crd and cte regions. previously, classes ii and iv were reported to be found mainly in dicots  <cit> . however, the three grass species included in this analysis, brachypodium, rice, and sorghum, each have representatives in the clades containing these class ii and iv chitinases, suggesting that monocot sequences have been heretofore under-represented in these classes. there are few examples of class vi and vii proteins in the literature, and we identified only one class vi and no class vii proteins amongst the brachypodium chitinases. class vi chitinases have an arrangement of auxiliary domains similar to class i proteins but contain a crd with fewer cysteine residues than the class i domain, as well as variations in the hinge and cte regions. one of the arabidopsis proteins designated class vi in this analysis, at1g <dig>  earlier was reported to be a class vii protein  <cit> . however, at1g <dig> lacks the catalytic-domain deletions characteristic of the class iv and vii proteins. as more sequences from additional species are added to such analyses, a clearer picture of the profiles of these families emerges.

each clade of the gh <dig> family contains at least one representative from all five species analyzed; however, the grass and eudicot sequences group as separate clusters within the clades . the difference in the number of genes between species is primarily due to localized, tandem duplications of sequences within the two larger clades. three good examples are the five arabidopsis genes ; six sorghum genes ; and four poplar genes  present in the class iv clade. additionally, the clade with mixed class i and ii sequences shows expansions in two brachypodium regions ; one poplar region ; and two rice regions . one possible explanation for this observation is proposed by bishop et al.  <cit>  as a result of their analyses of the pr proteins represented by the gh <dig> class i chitinases  <cit> . these researchers observed that the gh <dig> proteins disproportionately accumulate adaptive mutations in the active-site cleft. this unusual pattern of mutation is not shared by chitinases of the gh <dig> family, suggesting that adaptive functional modifications rapidly emerge as a result of direct pathogen defense against plant chitinolytic activity. this plant-pathogen coevolution of gh <dig> genes could be facilitated by the observed gene duplications: mutations in the additional gene copies could confer adaptive advantages in the face of attacks by a variety of pathogens.

the gh <dig> family
the gh <dig> family, previously named cellulase family a, includes plant-cell-wall-modifying enzymes such as cellulases, mannanases, and β-glucosidases  <cit> . the enzymatic activities of a few plant gh <dig> members have been characterized. one of these is hvman <dig>  a mannanase  from barley   <cit> . purified from 10-day-old seedlings, hvman <dig> exhibited relatively high rates of hydrolysis on moderately substituted galactomannan and unsubstituted glucomannan substrates  <cit> . another mannanase, leman4a, expressed in ripenning tomato , was also cloned, its endo- β-d-mannanase activity confirmed in an in vitro assay, and its structure solved  <cit> . rna-mediated suppression of leman4a expression slightly increased the firmness of ripening tomato fruits, suggesting that leman4a plays a supporting role in fruit softening  <cit> . the rice gh5bg gene  encodes a gh <dig> family β-glucosidase that is expressed in the shoots of seedlings and leaf sheaths of adult plants  <cit> . salt stress, submergence, and the stress hormones methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid induced the expression of gh5bg, hinting at a possible connection between gh5bg-mediated cell-wall remodeling and responses to environmental conditions  <cit> .

to obtain a more complete picture of the plant gh <dig> family, gh <dig> sequences from other plants  and from green algae  were retrieved from the cazy database or, in the case of hvman <dig>  from the research literature.  these protein sequences were combined with the arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar gh <dig> sequences to build an evolutionary tree. the plant gh <dig> proteins formed three major clades, a, b, and c, with high bootstrap support . the mannanases hvman <dig> and leman4a are in clade a, while the β-glucosidase gh5bg is in clade b . initially, clade b appeared to contain only monocot sequences and one sequence from a gymnosperm, sitka spruce . however, tblastn searches of genbank using the two brachypodium clade b representatives yielded additional members from dicotyledonous species: poplar, castor bean, tomato, and grape . for complete information on species included in the tree and branch labels, see additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  strikingly, the arabidopsis gh <dig> proteins fall within clades a and c, but not b . performing tblastn searches of the arabidopsis transcriptome   <cit>  using the brachypodium and eudicot clade b members as queries yielded no clade b matches, confirming the lack of an arabidopsis clade b representative. sequences from green algae  cluster with clades a and b with 100% and 98% bootstrap support, respectively . this finding suggests that both the a and b clades arose early in evolution. the absence of arabidopsis from clade b, a group spanning diverse plant species, underscores the point that, although arabidopsis is a powerful tool, it is not sufficient for studying all aspects of plants. multi-species comparisons are needed to form a comprehensive picture.

the gh <dig> family
the gh <dig> family includes polygalacturonases, which act on pectin  <cit> . pectin consists of carbohydrate polymers  rich in galacturonic acid  <cit> . pectin is a major component of the middle lamella connecting adjacent plant cells to each other  <cit> . in eudicots such as arabidopsis, pectin is also abundant in primary cell walls, where it forms a matrix surrounding the network of cellulose and hemicellulose  <cit> . gh <dig> polygalacturonases have been implicated in the reduction of cell-to-cell adhesion and the remodeling of cell walls, contributing to developmental processes such as pollen development, organ abscission, and fruit ripening  <cit> . for instance, loss-of-function mutations in the arabidopsis gh <dig> family member at3g <dig> - also known as quartet <dig>  - result in the production of tetrad pollen, caused by the failure of the four microspores to separate following meiosis  <cit> . qrt <dig> and the related genes arabidopsis dehiscence zone polygalacturonase <dig> and  <dig>  are all involved in anther dehiscence, a cell-separation process which allows for pollen release  <cit> . qrt <dig> and adpg <dig>  both contribute to floral-organ shedding  <cit> ; adpg <dig>  and adpg <dig> together promote the dehiscence of seed pods  <cit> . in vitro biochemical assays have confirmed the polygalacturonase activity of adpg <dig>  adpg <dig>  and the protein encoded by another gh <dig> family member, at1g <dig>  <cit> . twenty years ago, in tomato, it was shown that suppressing the expression of an endogenous polygalacturonase with antisense rna inhibited the degradation of pectin during fruit ripening  <cit> . since then, the importance of polygalacturonase activity in the ripening of many other fruits has also been demonstrated  <cit> .

both tandem and whole-genome duplications have contributed to the presence of a relatively large number of gh <dig> genes in arabidopsis compared to rice  <cit> . the type i cell walls of dicots contain much higher levels of pectin than the type ii walls of grasses  <cit> , and it has been proposed that the increased number of gh28s in arabidopsis reflects a greater need for pectin-active enzymes  <cit> . consistent with this hypothesis, maize  was recently reported to have  <dig> fewer gh <dig> genes than arabidopsis  <cit> , even though the maize genome is an order of magnitude larger and contains ~19% more protein-coding genes  <cit> . our identification of  <dig> gh <dig> family members in brachypodium and  <dig> in sorghum reinforces the conclusion that grasses have smaller numbers of polygalacturonase genes . although small compared to arabidopsis, the gh <dig> family in each of the grasses still consists of a substantial number of genes, possibly reflecting enzymatic functions associated with the pectin-rich middle lamella and the role of pectin during cell division.

to investigate the evolutionary history of the gh <dig> family, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences from arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium, sorghum, poplar, and maize . the maize sequences were as identified by penning et al.  <cit> , except that the proteins encoded by ac <dig>  and ac <dig>  were omitted from the analysis, because they did not contain pfam-predicted gh domains. for ease of reference, groups of gh <dig> proteins are labeled with the designations used by penning et al. for arabidopsis, rice, and maize  <cit> . these labels are included here to simplify comparisons across studies and do not necessarily correlate precisely with the clades of the six-species tree shown in figure  <dig>  for instance, while group a has 100% bootstrap support, group e as identified by penning et al.  <cit>  is split into two clades in our phylogenetic tree and is more appropriately regarded as part of the larger e/f/h clade . the proteins encoded by qrt <dig>  adpg <dig> and adpg <dig> fall into group d and the at1g48100-encoded protein into group c .

as has been noted previously  <cit> , the increased number of gh <dig> genes in arabidopsis appears to be due to expansion within groups, rather than the creation of entirely novel, eudicot-specific groups . for example, group g and the less-cohesive group e contain noticeably more arabidopsis than brachypodium members. there are, nevertheless, eudicot- and grass-specific clades; these include the eudicot-specific group f and the grass-specific group h recognized by penning et al.  <cit>  . in our analysis, groups f and h have strong bootstrap support,  <dig> and 100%, respectively. these two groups also form part of a larger group e/f/h, which is supported by 96% of  <dig>  bootstrap replicates .

a tree constructed from arabidopsis, rice, and maize sequences had indicated that group b is "arabidopsis only"  <cit> . in our larger tree with additional sequences from brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar, group b was loosely clustered  and contained one gh <dig> each from brachypodium and sorghum . additionally, a tblastn search with the brachypodium group b member, bradi5g <dig>  identified a wheat cdna  predicted to encode a protein with a gh <dig> domain. the presence of brachypodium and sorghum sequences in group b and the identification of a related wheat sequence suggest that monocots are under-represented in, rather than absent from, the gh <dig> group b.

a further distinction between the three-species gh <dig> tree of penning et al.  <cit>  and the six-species tree presented here is the presence - in the larger tree - of a small, but very-well-supported, grass-specific clade comprised of two brachypodium, one rice, and one sorghum sequence . both of the brachypodium genes, bradi2g <dig> and bradi2g <dig>  have est and illumina transcriptome data supporting their expression. when the four grass sequences in this clade were used as queries in tblastn searches of genbank, matches from five additional species  were retrieved. however, none of these additional sequences fell into the same clade as the query sequences; this result is consistent with the apparent absence of the clade from species outside the poaceae. as more genomes are sequenced and analyzed, it will be interesting to determine how widely distributed this clade actually is and whether it has a specialized function.

the gh <dig> family
the gh <dig> family includes α-l-arabinofuranosidases, which cleave terminal, non-reducing α-l-arabinofuranose residues from arabinose-containing compounds  <cit> . the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan i, found in dicot primary cell walls, and glucuronoarabinoxylan , the predominant hemicellulose in grass primary cell walls, both contain terminal arabinose residues in their side chains  <cit> . correspondingly, gh <dig> family members are implicated in plant-cell-wall remodeling  <cit> . the barley gh <dig> protein axah-i, for example, released arabinose from sugar beet arabinan, wheat arabinoxylan, and larch wood arabinogalactan  <cit> . in contrast to barley axah-i, some gh <dig> members are bi-functional enzymes, exhibiting both α-l-arabinofuranosidase and β-d-xylosidase activities. arabidopsis araf <dig>  for instance, exhibits a preference for arabinose-containing substrates but can release both l-arabinose and d-xylose from wheat and rye arabinoxylan  <cit> .

arabinosidases have received particular attention for their contributions to pectin degradation during fruit ripening: while gh <dig> polygalacturonases cleave the pectin backbone, arabinosidases degrade pectin side chains  <cit> . during strawberry  fruit development, α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity is prominent; in a comparison of two strawberry cultivars, the softer fruit of one cultivar also had higher α-l-arabinofuranosidase specific activity and higher transcript levels for three arabinofuranosidase genes, fraara <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . expression of gh <dig> family members is not, however, limited to fruits. the peach arf <dig> gene, although initially identified based on its activity in fruit, is also expressed in leaves and roots  <cit> .

arabidopsis araf <dig>  is similarly broadly expressed, with araf <dig> transcripts detectable in roots, rosettes, stems, flowers, and siliques  <cit> . analyses of plants transformed with an araf1-promoter-driven reporter indicated that araf <dig> is specifically expressed in tissues such as emerging lateral roots; the primary and developing secondary xylem of mature roots; the vasculature of cotyledons and leaves; and the phloem, cambium, and guard cells of the stem  <cit> . araf <dig> enzymatic activity is higher in young, growing stems than in mature stems, consistent with a possible cell-wall-remodeling function for araf <dig>  <cit> . inmmunolocalization assays with the lm <dig> antibody, which binds arabinan epitopes, revealed localized increases in signal intensity in mutant araf <dig> stem and root tissues compared to the wild-type  <cit> . conversely, wild-type stem sections exhibited markedly reduced signal intensity upon treatment with partially purified araf <dig>  <cit> . together, these results suggest that araf <dig> acts on endogenous arabinose-containing polysaccharides in these tissues  <cit> .

in contrast to the large gh <dig> family, which is over-represented in eudicots, the smaller gh <dig> family is over-represented in grasses. whereas arabidopsis has two gh <dig> family members and poplar three, each of the grasses examined has approximately double this number: rice has eight gh <dig> genes, brachypodium five, and sorghum six . a phylogenetic tree constructed from arabidopsis, poplar, rice, brachypodium, and sorghum gh <dig> proteins, as well as additional eudicot and grass gh <dig> sequences retrieved from the cazy database and genbank, is shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the grass sequences form two clades, both distinct from the single eudicot clade. this well-supported family structure  suggests that there has been duplication and diversification within the grass lineage. the clear separation between eudicot and grass sequences likely reflects the differing architectures of eudicot and grass cell walls, underscoring the need for a grass model. the similarity between brachypodium and other grasses with regard to the cell-wall-related gh <dig>  gh <dig>  and gh <dig> families illustrates that brachypodium can meet this need.

the gh <dig> family
the gh <dig> family is well-known as the α-amylase family  <cit> . it encompasses most of the starch-modifying enzymes with a wide range of substrate specificities and catalytic activities, such as α-amylases, pullulanases, isoamylases, cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases , and branching enzymes  <cit> . starch is the main component of cereal seeds and provides up to 80% of the calories consumed by humans. in addition, ethanol produced from starch is used as a transportation fuel  <cit> . based on an analysis of catalytic domains, the gh <dig> family has been divided into  <dig> subfamilies, most of which represent a single catalytic activity; in those subfamilies with more than one catalytic activity, the activities are closely related  <cit> . crystal structures have been reported for many gh <dig> family proteins. they have three conserved domains: domain a is the n-terminal, catalytic,  <dig> -barrel domain; domain b is a loop inserted in domain a; and domain c is a c-terminal, β-sandwich domain  <cit> .

we identified  <dig> gh <dig> genes from brachypodium,  <dig> from sorghum and  <dig> from poplar . there are  <dig> and  <dig> members in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences was constructed to investigate the evolutionary history of the gh <dig> family . a typical feature of this tree is that most of the branches have representatives from all species, suggesting broad conservation of the gh <dig> family in plants. the tree consists of three clades that are correlated with enzymatic activities: α-amylases , branching enzymes , and debranching enzymes including pullulanases  and isoamylases . all of the major branches of the tree are well-supported by bootstrap analysis .

α-amylases  are the best-studied of the gh <dig> enzymes, due to their wide industrial use. α-amylases catalyze the hydrolysis of internal α-d--glucosidic linkages in starch , glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides, releasing maltodextrins, maltooligosaccharides and glucose  <cit> . there are three α-amylase genes  in arabidopsis, and they represented three groups in previous phylogenetic analyses of α-amylase proteins from multiple species  <cit> . the atamy <dig>  protein contains a signal sequence and was predicted to enter the secretory pathway, atamy <dig>  was identified as plastid-targeted, and atamy <dig>  does not appear to be targeted to any particular compartment of the cell  <cit> . each enzyme is believed to have a different role in plants, given the putative subcellular localizations  <cit> . in our phylogenetic tree , the α-amylase clade is divided into two groups. one group containing atamy <dig>  includes a relatively large number of grass sequences. it has only  <dig> arabidopsis and  <dig> poplar members, but  <dig> brachypodium,  <dig> rice, and  <dig> sorghum members. most of the additional rice and sorghum sequences are in clusters within the genome, indicating that the gene expansion was due to recent, local duplication, which is common for plant glycosidase- and glycosyltransferase-related genes  <cit> . the other group clusters atamy <dig> and atamy <dig> together with representatives from other species into two separate subgroups. based on predictions of the targetp program  <cit>  , these α-amylase genes, except two sorghum genes  and two poplar genes , encode proteins with the same subcellular location as the arabidopsis member in the same group or subgroup.

branching enzymes catalyze the formation of branch points by cleaving the α- <dig>  linkage in polyglucans and reattaching the chain via an α- <dig> -glucan linkage; conversely, debranching enzymes directly hydrolyze the α- <dig> -glucosic linkages of polyglucans  <cit> . they are involved in starch biosynthesis in the cereal endosperm  <cit>  and affect the eating and cooking quality of rice  <cit> . in the phylogenetic tree , the branching and debranching enzymes form two clades. each member is well-conserved between different species, except that poplar lacks one isoamylase and arabidopsis lacks one branching enzyme representative . the presence of both grass and eudicot sequences in each of the major clades and most of the subclades of the gh <dig> family likely reflects the key roles of starch-modifying enzymes in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
a decade ago, phylogenetic trees for plant ghs primarily showed that a handful of plant enzymes were more closely related to each other than to their bacterial counterparts. since then, genome sequencing efforts have uncovered many more plant gh genes, whose cataloging can build the foundation for detailed functional studies. now, with the availability of genome-wide analyses of ghs in arabidopsis, rice, poplar, brachypodium, and sorghum, it is possible to examine evolutionary histories and hypothesize about orthologous relationships within plant gh families. our analysis showed that, while all angiosperms likely possess members of the same  <dig> gh families, there are significant differences between monocots and eudicots in the relationships within these families. these differences probably arose in part because of the compositional differences between grass and eudicot cell walls. however, by including additional species in our comparisons, we determined that several clades of ghs previously thought to contain only monocot or dicot proteins do, in fact, contain ghs from both eudicots and monocots. this highlights the importance of examining several species before making broad generalizations.

by defining the complement of brachypodium gh genes, we set the stage for brachypodium to be used as a grass model for investigations of the ghs and their diverse, associated functions. as with the eudicot model arabidopsis, forward and reverse genetics combined with the phenotypic characterizations possible in a small, rapidly growing plant will help elucidate the in planta roles of ghs. insights gained from brachypodium will inform translational research studies, with applications for the improvement of cereal crops and bioenergy grasses.
