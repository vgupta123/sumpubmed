BACKGROUND
for many decades it was a common practice to add sub-therapeutic amounts of antibiotics to the feed of pigs to control intestinal pathogens and to promote growth. however, the rising incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections prompted the european union in  <dig> to introduce a ban on growth-promoting antimicrobials . nevertheless, the overall use of therapeutic antimicrobials to treat infections of farm livestock remained high. throughout the fatting period, pigs received antimicrobials on average for 35 days, whereby most of the antimicrobials were administered to young animals  <cit> . those data demonstrate that the weaning period is a critical period for stress-related diseases and infections during livestock production  <cit> . stress factors such as weaning, pathogen exposure and littermate separation may induce reduced food intake, body weight loss and an increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections in these animals  <cit> . botanicals and phytogenic feed additives are discussed as useful alternatives to the therapeutic use of antimicrobials because they are supposed to modulate the immune system and to improve performance of pigs. in practice, mixtures of spices, herbs and oils that contain thymol, carvacrol and vanillin were used in piglet production. among the phytogenic additives, extracts from agrimonia have been reported as eligible candidates that possess antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, and exert beneficial effects on lipid metabolism . agrimonia belongs to the family of rosaceae and is a genus of 12– <dig> species of perennial herbaceous flowering plants. the most common species of agrimonia in europe  are used in folk medicine traditionally for the treatment of diarrhea, colitis, grumbling appendix, cystitis and wound healing . the major bioactive compounds of agrimonia eupatoria  are polyphenols such as flavonoids, mainly glycosides of luteolin and apigenin, and agrimoniin  <cit> . recent data show that extracts from ae are capable of improving the antioxidative status of broiler chickens  <cit> . agrimonia procera  is very similar to ae  <cit> , but seems to have a greater antioxidative capacity  <cit> , and is characterized by a higher yield than the commonly used ae. the effects of ap in piglet nutrition and on cytokine synthesis in challenged porcine immune cells are currently unknown. the first objective of this study was to test the effects of ap on growth performance and diarrhea frequency of weaned piglets in two feeding experiments.

weaning of piglets is often linked to a transient increase in inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin -1β, il- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor α  <cit>  which are produced by monocytes and macrophages, respectively. these cytokines stimulate systemic effects of inflammation such as fever, loss of appetite, and mobilization of protein and fat. conversely, il- <dig> prevents excessive tnfα production . the second objective of the study was to investigate putative effects of ap on the cytokine profile of lipopolysaccharides  challenged peripheral blood mononuclear cells , isolated from healthy piglets.

RESULTS

cytokine mrna expression and tnfα release of pbmc in response to ap extract
pbmc challenged with lps for  <dig> and 6 h, respectively, revealed a markedly higher mrna expression of tnfα, il-1β and il- <dig> than non-stimulated pbmc . the mrna level of tnfα was highest after 1 h, whereas the mrna levels of il-1β and il- <dig> where highest after 6 h of lps stimulation . in non-stimulated pbmc, ap extract  revealed no significant effect on the mrna expression of the cytokines . lps-challenged pbmc treated for  <dig> and 6 h with  <dig> %  of ape revealed a lower tnfα mrna expression than cells without ape treatment . the mrna expression of il-1β was also reduced in response to treatment with  <dig> % of ape, but this effect was only seen after 6 h , but not after <dig> h. the mrna expression of the anti-inflammatory il- <dig> was not affected by ape .figure  <dig>

to test whether the altered tnfα mrna expression in response to lps and ape was associated with an altered protein expression and release of tnfα, we analyzed the tnfα concentration in the cell media. the incubation media of non-stimulated pbmc was characterized by very low tnfα concentrations . lps stimulation increased the extracellular tnfα concentration, whereby the increase was much higher after 6 h than after 1 h of incubation . treatment of lps-challenged pmbc with  <dig> % ape for 1 h had no effect on the extracellular tnfα concentration. however, pbmc treated with ape for 6 h tended to release less tnfα into the cell media than those without ape treatment .figure  <dig>

discussion
it is suggested that phytochemicals are attributable to the proposed beneficial health effects of herbal feed additives in livestock. analyses from the current study show that ap belongs to plants that are rich in flavonoids and polyphenols, especially in agrimoniin which is a major bitter plant polyphenolic compound of ap. by comparison of ap with other agrimonia species, for example those which were used for humans, ap contained less total flavonoids than ae, although the total polyphenols of ap are higher compared to the extracts from flowering aerial parts of other agrimonia species  <cit> . however, the differences in contents of phytochemicals between agrimonia species and within a defined species could be also caused by differences in the harvest period, the growth conditions and the plant parts that are used for the analysis.

recent studies have documented that herbal feed additives could improve the performance of piglets, including food intake  <cit> . a trend towards a higher food intake was also seen in the ap treated piglets from experiment  <dig>  assuming that also herbals such as ap, may stimulate the appetite of piglets. although such an appetite-stimulating effect of ap was not seen in experiment  <dig>  piglets that were fed a diet with  <dig>  g ap per kg diet revealed a lower fcr than piglets treated without ap. both effects of ap on food intake and fcr are desirable and indicative for an improved performance. the fact that piglets that were fed the high ap diet containing  <dig>  g ap per kg diet revealed a deteriorated fcr compared to that of control piglets suggests a biphasic effect of ap with optimum effects in the low dosage range. aminotransferase activities in plasma which are sensitive markers of possible tissue damage, particularly liver toxicity, do not imply a toxic effect of the high ap diet, because circulating alt and ast activities were not different between the ap groups and the control group. weaning is most commonly associated with an increased proliferation of gut microbiota and hypersecretion of bacterial enterotoxins  <cit> . non-absorbed dietary phenolics and their metabolites have been assumed to exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the microbiota  <cit> . it is possible that the beneficial effect of the low ap diet on fcr and nitrogen retention in our study was caused by beneficial effects on gut microbiota. antioxidative effects of ap appear to play no role, because ap fed piglets revealed no higher antioxidant capacity of the plasma than the control animals. on the other hand the adverse effect of the high ap diet on fcr could possibly be provoked by the high amounts of tannins such as agrimoniin which are known to deteriorate the digestibility of nutrients, in particular that of protein  <cit> .

various studies demonstrated the anti-inflammatory potential of agrimonia  <cit> . although the mechanisms of the antiinflammatory effects of plant extracts have not yet been fully elucidated, recent data show that extracts from ae were capable of reducing the activity of nuclear factor-kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells  via suppression of its nuclear translocation  <cit> . it is discussed that polyphenols activate heterodimers of nf-e2-related factors 2/antioxidant responsive element pathway which in turn may modify the nf-κb activity  <cit> . in order to test the anti-inflammatory potential of ap, we used therefore lps-challenged pbmc from healthy piglets as inflammation model. lps are found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, where they function as endotoxins and elicit strong immune responses. we found that extracts from ap were capable of reducing the mrna expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnfα and il-1β in the lps-challenged pbmc, without affecting the mrna expression of the anti-inflammatory il- <dig>  this means that ap is capable of changing the cytokine profile towards a reduction of the pro-inflammatory response under lps-challenging conditions. moreover, the data show a time-dependent impact of ape on the mrna expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with strong effects during the first hours, and failing effects after 20 h. pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors are known to antagonize the anabolic effects of insulin-like growth factor   <dig> by reducing its synthesis and by a reduction of the responsiveness of target tissue to igf- <dig> stimulation  <cit> . considering the fact that weaning-associated intestinal inflammation  <cit>  is usually linked to adverse effects on nutrient metabolism, growth, and muscle development in pigs  <cit> , a reduction of a severe pro-inflammation state by ap could contribute to reduce acute symptoms of infection and to maintain normal growth conditions. we assume that the phytochemicals of ap are responsible for the down regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines since apigenin and luteolin has been already identified as inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in lps-stimulated pbmc  <cit> , and as factors which reduce the transcriptional activity of nf-κb in lps-stimulated primary monocytes  <cit>  and macrophages  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the data show that low dosages of ap could provide beneficial effects on feed intake and fcr in piglets. data from in vitro studies with lps-challenged pbmc indicate that ap extracts are capable of reducing the mrna expression and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the actual efficacy of ap to maintain the health of piglets and its potential to reduce the application of antimicrobials has to be investigated under practical animal production conditions.
