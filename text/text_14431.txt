BACKGROUND
fusarium head blight  of small grains is caused by fungal pathogens of fusarium species, primarily fusarium graminearum. fhb is widespread in wheat  and barley  production areas globally and has caused significant economic losses due to reduced yield and grain quality  <cit> . f. graminearum infects spikes and the resulting infected grains are often contaminated with trichothecene mycotoxins  and create adverse health issues for animal and human consumption  <cit> . practices to manage fhb include deploying resistant varieties, crop rotation and fungicide application. developing a thorough understanding of the defense response and genetic mechanisms conferring resistance to f. graminearum infection may result in more precise genetic manipulation and control of the disease.

fusarium species infect barley after anthesis  <cit>  and colonize the brush hairs  at the extruded seed tip, followed by invasion into the developing caryopsis  <cit> . in contrast, fusarium species infect wheat spikes during anthesis with colonization of floret surfaces first and followed by penetration of floral tissues and spread within the spike, ultimately resulting in bleaching of the whole spike . wheat exhibits two primary forms of partial resistance to fhb which are termed type i  and type ii  resistance  <cit> . in barley, disease symptoms do not spread in the spike, even in susceptible cultivars, indicating that barley exhibits a natural level type ii resistance  <cit> . during the infection process, f. graminearum grows intercellularly and asymptomatically at the advancing hyphal front and later grows intracellularly and induces host cell death . virulence of f. graminearum on host cells is associated with the expression of genes encoding plant cell wall degradation enzymes , proteases, lipases and enzymes for trichothecene biosynthesis .

a number of studies have examined the host response in wheat and barley to f. graminearum infection or don application via profiling the host transcriptome and identified host genes providing basal plant-pathogen resistance and genes responding specifically to trichothecene accumulation . in general, host plants respond to pathogen attack with two forms of defense mechanisms. conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns  or damage-associated molecular patterns  are perceived by plant pattern recognition receptors  and result in pamp-triggered immunity . to counteract pti, adapted pathogens deliver effector proteins to enhance virulence which can be recognized by intracellular resistance proteins  and initiate effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . downstream events of pti and eti include calcium ion influx, generation of reactive oxygen species , signaling through kinase cascades, hormonal changes, transcriptional reprogramming, cell wall appositions and hypersensitive response. in addition to general defense strategies, barley genes that specifically respond to trichothecenes have been identified. it has been shown that a don-inducible uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferase gene  can convert don to less toxic don-3-o-glucoside  in yeast  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis and wheat expressing hvugt <dig> exhibited increased resistance to don  <cit> . in addition, abc transporters and glutathione-s-transferases  have been implicated in don tolerance  <cit> . recently, long noncoding rnas  have been shown to act as potential regulators of transcriptional response to pathogen infection. a study identified f. oxysporum responsive lncrnas in arabidopsis thaliana and suggested that lncrnas were important components of the antifungal network  <cit> .

in barley, resistance to fhb is partial and conditioned by quantitative trait loci . two major qtl were identified on chromosome 2h bin <dig>  and 6h bin <dig>  in the six-rowed cultivar chevron . the resistance allele at the 2hb <dig> qtl was associated with late heading date and a fine mapping study showed that heading date and fhb resistance were controlled by tightly linked loci  <cit> . fhb resistance at the 6hb <dig> qtl was associated with high grain protein content and it is not known if this is due to linkage or pleiotropy  <cit> . although numerous qtl have been identified, the understanding of the genetic mechanisms that these qtl contribute to resistance is limited. to determine the responses associated with fhb resistance conferred by the 2hb <dig> and 6hb <dig> qtl, we performed transcriptomic profiling using rna-seq on two r nils and their susceptible recurrent parents m <dig> and lacey, respectively. the objectives of this study were to  develop an atlas of gene expression in barley during f. graminearum infection;  identify transcriptional differences between the resistant and susceptible alleles at both qtl and discover potential defense mechanisms to fhb; and  identify and characterize lncrnas during barley-fusarium interaction. our results provide the foundation for examining the mechanisms of fhb resistance conferred by two resistant qtl.

RESULTS
genetic and phenotypic characterization of the chromosome 2h bin <dig> and 6h bin <dig> fhb qtl nils
two fhb resistant alleles derived from chevron, 2hb <dig> and 6hb <dig>  were introgressed via backcrossing into the susceptible genotypes m <dig>  and lacey , respectively. to map the introgressed regions, the plants carrying the resistant allele at 2hb <dig> and 6hb <dig> and the susceptible recurrent parents were genotyped with the barley 9 k iselect snp array  <cit>  and the results revealed that  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the recurrent parent genome was recovered in the 2hb <dig> resistant  nil and 6hb <dig> r nil, respectively. based on the iselect consensus genetic map  <cit> , the chevron alleles were introgressed in the expected qtl regions . the 2hb <dig> qtl ranges from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  on chromosome 2h, while the 6hb <dig> qtl ranges from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  on chromosome 6h.

to evaluate the disease phenotypes  of the r nils, replicated field trials were conducted in st. paul, mn in  <dig> and  <dig>  in both trials, the nils exhibited significantly lower disease severity when compared to m <dig> and lacey, respectively . don content in harvested grains was previously shown to be positively correlated with fhb severity  <cit> . however, don and ergosterol  concentration during disease progression has not been investigated. to determine the pattern of don and ergosterol accumulation in the nils, we sampled the spikes from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 days post inoculation . as the disease progressed, both r nils accumulated less don and ergosterol when compared with their respective recurrent parents . the difference in don accumulation was significant at  <dig> dpi ,  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi  for the 2hb <dig> nil and at  <dig> dpi  for the 6hb <dig> nil. the difference in ergosterol accumulation was significant at  <dig> dpi  for the 2hb <dig> nil and m <dig> comparison but there was no difference in the 6hb <dig> nil and lacey comparison . in addition, the contents of don and ergosterol exhibited significant correlation within each genotype and year . taken together, when compared to the susceptible parents these results indicated that the two r nils exhibited reduced severity likely due to restricting fungal growth and don accumulation.fig.  <dig> disease resistance phenotype of the two fhb r nils. the r nils exhibited reduced fhb disease severity when compared to their respective recurrent parents in  <dig>  and  <dig>  field trials. disease scores of each genotype are shown in box plots. *, p <  <dig> , **, p < <dig> 



transcriptome analysis
to examine the defense response and to gain an increased understanding of the genetic basis of fhb resistance in barley, rna-seq was performed to measure the transcriptome changes on three biological replications of the two nils and their respective recurrent parents after f. graminearum or mock inoculation at  <dig> and 96 h after inoculation . the experimental procedure and analysis pipeline are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the accumulation of don and ergosterol were analyzed for all samples used for sequencing . no don or ergosterol was detected in any of the genotypes at  <dig> hai after mock or fungal inoculation. at  <dig> hai, the 2hb <dig> r nil accumulated less don and ergosterol than m <dig> although the difference was not significant. jia et al.  <cit>  analyzed the 2hb <dig> r nil and m <dig> and observed significant difference in don content at  <dig> hai. the 6hb <dig> r nil and lacey samples had similar amounts of don and ergosterol.

a total of  <dig>  billion quality reads were generated from the  <dig> samples with an average of  <dig> million filtered reads per sample . the rna-seq reads were mapped to the barley genome assembly  <cit>  and between  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million uniquely-mapped reads were identified in the samples. pearson correlation coefficients ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between biological replicates . transcripts with differential expression levels  were identified and referred to as differentially expressed genes  . expression levels of transcripts in fusarium-inoculated samples were compared with those in mock-inoculated samples of the same genotype at each time point to identify fusarium responsive degs. to identify degs associated with fhb resistance, expression levels of transcripts in the two r nils were compared with the corresponding susceptible parents. table  <dig> lists the number of degs identified in all pairwise comparisons . the rna-seq results were validated on  <dig> genes and one lncrna for the two nils and recurrent parents with qrt-pcr assays .table  <dig> number of differentially expressed genes  identified by all pairwise comparisons



barley host response to f. graminearum infection
the number of fusarium responsive degs identified in the 2hb <dig> r nil – m <dig> and 6hb <dig> r nil – lacey comparisons at  <dig> and/or  <dig> hai were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. when combined, a unique set of  <dig> fhb responsive degs were identified in the four genotypes after f. graminearum and mock treatments at  <dig> or  <dig> hai , representing  <dig>  % of the high confidence genes  positioned on the morex genome assembly  <cit> . gene expression clustering based on fusarium responsive degs revealed distinct groups of host genes responding to pathogen attack at  <dig> and  <dig> hai . for each genotype, the number of fhb responsive degs increased dramatically from  <dig> to  <dig> hai, indicating an increased defense response to fungal infection from early to late stage.fig.  <dig> barley host response to f. graminearum infection. a hierarchical clustering of fhb-responsive differentially expressed genes  in 2hb <dig> r nil, 6hb <dig> r nil, m <dig> and lacey at  <dig> and  <dig> hai. f48/m <dig> indicates comparison of f. graminearum- versus mock-inoculated samples. red, induced; blue, repressed. b categorization of fhb induced  or repressed  genes in m <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hai. c a sunburst plot of enriched go terms identified in degs in m <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hai. size of individual slices represent statistical significance . go terms in blue boxes were enriched in repressed genes and go terms in red boxed were enriched in induced genes. pal, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase



to gain a further understanding of the barley host response to fusarium infection, the transcriptomic changes of the susceptible parent m <dig> after f. graminearum and mock inoculation were analyzed. compared to mock inoculation, there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> and  <dig> genes down-regulated at  <dig> and 96 h after f. graminearum inoculation, respectively. these results demonstrate a dramatic increase in degs between  <dig> and  <dig> hai. for ease of interpretation, all the degs were categorized into broad functional classes based on their annotations which included abiotic stress , biotic stress , cell wall , hormone, metabolism , miscellaneous , proteolysis , disease resistance  genes and receptor-like kinases , redox proteins , regulatory proteins , signal transduction , transport and trafficking, and unknown. .

an overrepresentation analysis using agrigo  <cit>  was performed to identify enriched gene ontology  terms associated with the barley-f. graminearum interaction in m <dig> . at  <dig> hai no enriched go terms were identified for the up-regulated degs whereas two terms, o-glycosyl hydrolase activity  and enzyme inhibitor activity , were enriched in the down-regulated degs. the o-glycosyl hydrolase term includes gene products involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as endoglucanases, glucosidases, invertases and galactosidases. the term enzyme inhibitor activity comprises endopeptidase inhibitors and pectin methylesterase inhibitors . at  <dig> hai nine functional groups were enriched in up-regulated degs, including kinases , oxidoreductases  and aminocyclopropanecarboxylate  oxidase), storage proteins , phenylalanine ammonia-lyases , serine-type endopeptidase inhibitors , transporters , peroxidases , chitinases  and glycosyltransferases . in contrast, four types of genes were enriched in down-regulated degs, including enzyme inhibitors , glycosyltransferases , peptidases  and phosphorelay signal transduction system . mapman analysis was performed to visualize degs involved in diverse metabolic pathways  <cit>  . these results suggested that at  <dig> hai there were up-regulation of pathways involved in amino acid and lipid metabolism, glutathione homeostasis, secondary metabolism and cell wall reinforcement. pectin enzymes and lipid transfer proteins  exhibited continuous down-regulation at both time points. functional classification and go enrichment analysis of fusarium responsive degs in lacey revealed similar results as those in m <dig> .

constitutive and induced defense response in the 2hb <dig> r nil to f. graminearum infection
to understand the fhb resistance responses mediated by the 2hb <dig> qtl, transcriptomic comparisons were conducted between the 2hb <dig> r nil and m <dig> inoculated with f. graminearum or water . in these comparisons, up-regulation means that transcript accumulation was higher in the r nil, and down-regulation means that transcript accumulation was lower in the r nil. genomic positions of the degs in the four comparisons  showed a similar pattern of distribution as that of all high-confidence genes across barley chromosomes  . hierarchical clustering of the degs revealed two patterns . firstly, the up-regulated gene profile of 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig> showed the highest correlation with that of 2hb <dig> r/m69_m <dig>  a total of  <dig> genes were expressed higher in the r nil both in the absence  and presence of f. graminearum infection at  <dig> hai . secondly,  <dig> of the up-regulated genes in the 2hb <dig> r/m69_m <dig> comparison exhibited down-regulation in the 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig> comparison . venn diagram analysis of up-regulated genes among comparisons 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig>  2hb <dig> r/m69_m <dig>  2hb <dig> r/m69_m <dig> and m69_f96/m <dig> revealed that 52 %  of up-regulated genes in comparison 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig> were induced later in m <dig> at  <dig> hai . taken together, these results suggested that the 2hb <dig> r nil exhibited elevated defense responses in the absence of pathogen challenge  and mounted a quicker defense response when challenged with f. graminearum.fig.  <dig> constitutive and induced defense response conferred by the 2hb <dig> qtl to f. graminearum infection. a genome-wide distribution of degs between the 2hb <dig> r nil and m <dig>  the outmost circle represents barley chromosomes 1h-7h. the height of histogram bins represents the number of degs in a defined genomic region. tracks from inside going outside represents degs identified in comparisons 2hb <dig> r/m69_m <dig> , r/m69_m <dig> , r/m69_f <dig>  and r/m69_f <dig> . b clustering of degs revealed constitutive elevation of defense response in the 2hb <dig> r nil when compared to m <dig>  the 2hb <dig> r nil exhibited increased accumulation of transcripts after mock inoculation at 48 h  and 96 h  or fungal inoculation at 48 h , which accumulated higher in m <dig> at 96 h . the red color indicates induction and blue color repression. c venn diagram of up-regulated genes in comparisons of 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig>  2hb <dig> r/m69_m <dig>  2hb <dig> r/m69_m <dig> and m69_f96/m <dig>  d a sunburst plot of enriched go terms identified in up-regulated degs in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hai. size of individual slices represent statistical significance . e categorization of induced  or repressed  genes in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hai



to identify gene functions associated with fhb resistance mediated by the 2hb <dig> qtl, go enrichment analysis of up-regulated genes in comparisons of 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig> and 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig> were performed . three go terms were overrepresented in the comparison 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig>  namely, oxidoreductase activity , glycosyltransferase activity  and cellulose synthase activity . the oxidoreductases included enzymes with multiple functions, such as lignification , cuticular wax production , ethylene  and jasmonic acid  biosynthesis , secondary metabolism  and peroxidases. four terms were enriched in the comparison 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig>  including enzyme inhibitor activity , peptidase activity , o-glycosyl hydrolase activity  and phosphorelay signal transduction . functional categorization of degs  found that at  <dig> hai the 2hb <dig> r nil had more up-regulated genes involved in defense-related categories, such as r genes and rlks, defense hormones -related), peroxidases, cell wall fortification and stress responses . at  <dig> hai, m <dig> exhibited an increased number of up-regulated genes in defense-related categories, suggesting that the timing of defense response in m <dig> was delayed when compared to the r nil. the expression changes of representative defense transcripts at  <dig> and  <dig> hai are summarized in fig. 4a.fig.  <dig> representative genes associated with fhb resistance identified in the 2hb <dig> r nil and 6hb <dig> r nil after f. graminearum infection. a left panel, representative genes that had increased accumulation in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig> at  <dig> hai. right panel, representative genes that had increased accumulation in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig> at  <dig> hai. abct, abc transporter; gst, glutathione-s-transferase; crk, cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase; ltp, lipid transfer protein; slp, subtilisin-like protease; pmei, pectin methylesterase inhibitor; hp, histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein; hk, histidine kinase; arr, two-component response regulator. b expression profiles of candidate genes in the 2hb <dig> qtl region. exo70h <dig>  exocyst subunit exo <dig> family protein h6; hvs <dig>  senescence regulator s40; vps <dig>  vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 62; hht, omega-hydroxypalmitate o-feruloyl transferase. c representative genes that had increased accumulation in the 6hb <dig> r nil compared to lacey at 48 h after f. graminearum inoculation. note the later induction of genes in lacey at 96 h after f. graminearum inoculation. pdr, pleiotropic drug resistance protein; ups, ubiquitin proteasome system; igps, indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase; aadc, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; prx, peroxidase



given the observed constitutive and induced elevation of defense responses in the r nil and late, overlapping defense responses in m <dig>  we hypothesized that the expression of candidate gene for the 2hb <dig> qtl might mirror the transcriptomic profiles of the r nil and meet the following conditions:  they are located in the qtl region; and  they were expressed higher in the r nil versus the susceptible parent after mock inoculation at  <dig> and/or  <dig> hai and/or after f. graminearum inoculation at  <dig> hai. we examined the expression profiles of nineteen genes that met these criteria . three cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases  appeared to be promising candidates .

earlier induction of defense response mediated by 6hb <dig> qtl
the expression profile of degs in the 6hb <dig> r nil at  <dig> hai clustered with those of all four genotypes at  <dig> hai, which indicated a quicker mobilization of defense response mediated by the chevron allele at the 6hb <dig> qtl . after fusarium inoculation, a total of  <dig> genes were induced in the 6hb <dig> r nil at 48 h, of which  <dig>  were induced in lacey at  <dig> hai . comparisons of the resistant and susceptible genotypes at the 6hb <dig> qtl after f. graminearum inoculation identified  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts with differential accumulation patterns at  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai, respectively. at  <dig> hai, transcripts with increased accumulation in the r nil were involved in cell wall, biotic stress, proteolysis and transport . representative transcripts encoded defense-related proteins including hvugt <dig>  pmei, pr proteins, acc synthase, gsts, proteases, protease inhibitors and abc transporters .

transcripts accumulated higher in both r nils and expression of hvugt13248
a group of  <dig> transcripts exhibited increased accumulation in the r nils when compared to the respective susceptible parents at  <dig> hai . these transcripts encode proteins such as hvugt <dig>  pr proteins, acc synthase, cytochrome p450s, gsts and transporters. this suggested that these transcripts might be involved in basal defense to fusarium infection, and were co-regulated by two qtl. the hvugt <dig> gene had increased accumulation in both 2hb <dig> and 6hb <dig> r nils when compared to the respective susceptible parents at  <dig> hai. at  <dig> hai, expression of hvugt <dig> in the r nils and recurrent parents were induced to comparable levels. barley genotypes, even ones susceptible to fhb, exhibit natural type ii resistance to f. graminearum by delaying or restricting the spread of the disease in the spike and this resistance may be partially associated with the ability of hvugt <dig> to convert don to d3g  <cit> . the higher accumulation of hvugt <dig> during the early stage of fungal infection  in both r nils may further enhance resistance to f. graminearum.

identification of lncrnas from barley spikes responsive to f. graminearum inoculation
long noncoding rnas  have emerged as important regulators of transcription  <cit> . genome-wide identification of lncrnas from plants has been reported recently . applying the informatics pipeline developed by li et al. , we identified  <dig>  lncrnas from the four barley genotypes inoculated with f. graminearum or water at  <dig> and  <dig> hai . the class codes of lncrnas describing their relationship with the barley reference transcripts were summarized in additional file 16: table s <dig>  the majority  of lncrnas were intergenic lncrnas . thirty-four were long noncoding natural antisense transcripts . a comparison of lncrnas to the barley high confidence protein–coding transcripts revealed that lncrnas have fewer exons and shorter transcript length than protein-coding rnas . differentially expressed lincrnas  were identified applying the same criteria as in degs analysis. we identified  <dig> and  <dig> fhb responsive dels in the 2hb <dig> r nil-m <dig> comparison and the 6hb <dig> r nil-lacey comparison, respectively. after removing duplicates, a total of  <dig> lincrnas were fhb responsive in all genotypes at  <dig> and/or  <dig> hai. the number of differentially accumulated lincrnas was  <dig> in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig> and was  <dig> in the 6hb <dig> r nil compared to lacey. the number of up- and down-regulated lincrnas in respective comparisons is listed in additional file 17: table s <dig> and the associated lncrnas are listed in additional file 18: table s <dig> 

hierarchical clustering of the fhb responsive lincrnas identified that the expression profile of dels in 6hb <dig> r_f48/m <dig> clustered with those of the four genotypes at  <dig> hai . clustering of dels between 2hb <dig> r nil and m <dig> revealed that the profiles of dels in the datasets 2hb <dig> r/m69_f <dig> and 2hb <dig> r/m69_m <dig> were most similar, indicating higher accumulation of fhb responsive dels in the 2hb <dig> r nil in the absence of fusarium attack .fig.  <dig> clustering of differentially expressed lncrnas  in the nils and recurrent parents. a fhb responsive dels in the nils at  <dig> and  <dig> hai. b constitutive expression of dels in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig>  the 2hb <dig> r nil exhibited increased accumulation of a subset of lncrnas after mock inoculation at  <dig> and 96 h or fungal inoculation at 48 h. c co-regulation of an lncnat/mrna pair. xloc_ <dig> and its sense transcript  showed co-induction in m <dig> at 96 h after f. graminearum inoculation. d positive correlation of the induction of a crk and an upstream lncrna. expression value  of mloc_ <dig> in individual treatment was normalized to the maximum expression value of mloc_ <dig> among all treatments which was set to  <dig> . the same was applied to normalize the expression value of xloc_050232



co-induction of lncrnas and neighboring transcripts
transcription of lncrnas can regulate the expression of neighboring genes  <cit> . by comparing the expression levels of lncnats and their sense transcripts, we identified one lncnat , which exhibited induction in the m69_f96/m <dig> comparison. its sense transcript  which encoded a trichome birefringence-like  protein involved in cellulose biosynthesis  <cit>  showed co-induction  . the lncnat xloc_ <dig> was transcribed from the 3’ end and overlapped with the last exon of its sense transcript. in addition, five lincrnas exhibited co-induction with their nearby transcripts after fungal inoculation. these transcripts encoded two receptor-like kinases, an alpha/beta fold hydrolase, a late embryogenesis abundant protein and an unknown protein  . one of the rlks was a cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase , which was identified as a candidate gene for the 2hb <dig> qtl. the lincrna xloc_ <dig> is located approximately 2 kb upstream of mloc_ <dig> . its expression was not detected in m <dig> after mock inoculation  or f. graminearum inoculation at  <dig> hai but was induced after f. graminearum inoculation at  <dig> hai, which coincided with the induction of mloc_ <dig> in m <dig>  in the 2hb <dig> r nil, xloc_ <dig> was constitutively expressed in mock or f. graminearum inoculated samples at both  <dig> and  <dig> hai which coincided with the constitutively higher accumulation of mloc_ <dig> in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared with m <dig> .

discussion
gene expression atlas of barley host responses to f. graminearum infection
in the present study we investigated the defense response of two barley nils and their recurrent parents to f. graminearum infection. previous transcriptomic analyses of barley-f. graminearum were conducted using the barley <dig> genechip technology and provided a framework for understanding the complex interaction of the pathosystem  <cit> . next-generation sequencing technology provides more sensitivity and versatility in querying the transcriptome changes than microarray technologies  <cit> . in addition, the assembly of the barley genome allowed genome-wide transcriptional profiling using rna-seq technology. we identified  <dig> fhb responsive genes in four barley genotypes of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were also identified by boddu et al.  <cit>  and boddu et al.  <cit> , respectively, validating the reliability and reproducibility of our results. the high sensitivity of rna-seq permitted detection of more degs in certain categories. for example,  <dig> and  <dig> receptor-like kinase transcripts were identified by this study and boddu et al.  <cit> , respectively. in addition, transcripts involved in new functional groups were discovered, such as pectinesterase inhibitors, cuticular wax biosynthesis, small auxin up rnas , gibberellin biosynthesis and phosphorelay signal transduction. the significantly increased volume of data provided by rna-seq enabled us to conduct hierarchical clustering and enrichment analysis to better understand the host response to fusarium infection and potential molecular mechanisms conferred by resistant rils. lncrnas have been shown to play important roles in regulating transcription. however, the identification and characterization of lncrnas in barley-fusarium interaction have not been reported. we identified lncrnas from the barley rna-seq dataset and analyzed their differential expression patterns in response to fusarium infection. co-regulation of lncrnas and mrnas were also uncovered. thus, our rna-seq results of barley- f. graminearum interaction provide a comprehensive gene expression atlas for gene and lncrna discovery and further comparative studies of wheat-fusarium interaction or other cereal-pathogen pathosystems.

constitutive and induced defense response mediated by the 2hb <dig> qtl
the 2hb <dig> qtl is considered a major locus for resistance to fhb and don accumulation. a previous study examining the 2hb <dig> nil pair identified  <dig> degs in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig> after f. graminearum or water inoculation  <cit> . due to the limited number of degs, it was not possible to perform clustering and enrichment analysis to identify patterns in differential transcription and develop an understanding of the gene expression dynamics of infection. in the present study, we identified  <dig> transcripts that exhibited differential accumulation profiles in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared with m <dig> after f. graminearum and/or mock inoculation at  <dig> and/or  <dig> hai. our comparative transcriptomic analyses of the 2hb <dig> r nil and m <dig> suggested that the r nil exhibited elevated expression of defense-related genes in the absence of f. graminearum challenge and mounted earlier and potentiated defense response when challenged with f. graminearum. a simplified model is proposed to elucidate the defense response provided by the 2hb <dig> qtl . at 48 h after fungal infection, nine rlks and three nbs-lrr class r genes were expressed higher in the r nil than in m <dig>  indicating that the r nil might recognize fungal elicitors and effectors and elicit pti and eti more efficiently. f. graminearum is classified as a hemibiotrophic pathogen, exhibiting a brief biotrophic phase during initial stage of infection before switching to necrotrophy and inducing cell death  <cit> . previous studies have suggested that the defense hormone sa contributed to wheat resistance to f. graminearum during early stage of infection and exhibited complex interaction with the ja pathway  <cit> . the fhb resistance in wheat expressing arabidopsis npr <dig> is associated with increased accumulation of sa and a systemic acquired resistance -like response  <cit> . npr <dig>  and dir <dig>  are positive regulators of sa and sar signaling, respectively  <cit>  and we identified barley homologs of these genes that exhibited higher expression in the r nil at  <dig> hai but not at  <dig> hai. we also identified elevated accumulation of pr <dig>  transcripts in the r nil compared to m <dig> after mock treatment. these results indicated that elevated sa/sar signaling might be important for fhb resistance during the early stages of infection. it has been shown that ja and et are involved in wheat and barley fhb resistance . genes in both biosynthesis and signaling pathways of ja and et had increased accumulation in the r nil compared to m <dig> at 48 h, such as lipoxygenase  and gdsl lipase . at  <dig> hai, the activities of oxidoreductases, cellulose synthases and glycosyltransferases were overrepresented in the r nil, suggesting that the r nil responded to the infection with cell wall reinforcement , expression of pr proteins  and antimicrobial metabolites , and trichothecene detoxification . the hvugt <dig>  had higher expression in the r nil at 48 h which could detoxify don more rapidly and mitigate its toxic effects on barley cells.fig.  <dig> a proposed working model for fhb resistance conferred by the barley 2hb <dig> qtl. note the higher expression of defense-related genes in the 2hb <dig> r nil when compared to m <dig> during the mock treatment and within 48 h after f. graminearum infection. asterisks indicate that the transcripts also accumulated higher in the 6hb <dig> r nil compared to lacey after fungal infection at 48 h. arrows indicate positive interaction. perpendicular lines indicate negative interaction. red color indicates virulence factor or signals derived from from f. graminearum. lac, laccase; cesa, cellulose synthase; ros, reactive oxygen species; npr <dig>  nonexpressor of pr genes 1; dir <dig>  defective in induced resistance 1; pr, pathogenesis-related; lox, lipoxygenase; glip, gdsl lipase; pm, plasma membrane. see text for other abbreviations



as the disease progressed to 96 h, a shift in the gene categories was observed in the transcripts with higher accumulation in the r nil. pmeis, ltps, proteases and phosphorelay signal transduction pathway were enriched in the r nil . in contrast, these activities were repressed in m <dig> after f. graminearum infection at both  <dig> and 96 h . overexpression of pmei has been shown to limit fungal disease in arabidopsis and wheat  <cit> . pathogen attack can induce pme activity and lead to decreased pectin methylesterification, which facilitates pathogen invasion of plant cells  <cit> . our results suggested that f. graminearum might increase pme activity by repressing the expression of pmei transcripts in m <dig>  but in the r nil the repression of pmei transcripts may have been inhibited and cell wall pectin remained highly methylesterified, making the cell wall less susceptible to the effects of pectin degradation enzymes secreted by f. graminearum. expression of genes encoding lipid transfer proteins can be induced by fungal pathogens. biological roles of ltps include antifungal activity, sar signaling and cuticular lipid deposition  <cit> . overexpression of a wheat ltp <dig> gene increased resistance to cochliobolus sativus and f. graminearum  <cit> . an ltp gene is proposed as the candidate gene for the wheat fhb qtl qfhs.ifa-5a  <cit> . and an arabidopsis ltp enhances resistance to a trichothecene toxin by increasing glutathione content  <cit> . in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig>  after fungal infection the number of up-regulated ltp genes increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , suggesting that they may contribute to the fhb resistance by inhibiting f. graminearum growth and/or reinforce the cuticle. during infection of host plants, fusarium species secrete not only cwdes, but also proteases to hydrolyze host proteins. plants respond by producing their own proteases and protease inhibitors to inhibit fungal counterparts. gottwald et al.  <cit>  reported the enrichment of proteases and protease inhibitors in the transcriptome of the fhb resistant wheat cultivar after infection. we observed enrichment of proteases in the r nil at  <dig> hai, including aspartyl proteases, subtilisin-like serine proteases and cysteine proteases. at  <dig> hai, the r nil exhibited enrichment of genes involved in phosphorelay signal transduction pathway that was regulated by cytokinin. eight genes functioning in cell cycle and division exhibited increased accumulation in the r nil compared to m <dig> as well. one of the prominent roles of cytokinin is to control cell cycle and cell division. the up-regulation of the cytokinin pathway in the r nil suggested that cell proliferation and kernel development were less disturbed in the r nil than in m <dig>  consistent with the reduced disease severity phenotype of the r nil.

identification of candidate genes for the 2hb <dig> qtl
previous studies have suggested that higher accumulation of defense-related transcripts and activation of immunity in the absence of pathogen challenge contributed to disease resistance in soybean and arabidopsis  <cit> . similarly, the 2hb <dig> r nil exhibited elevated expression of defense-related genes upon mock treatment. based on physical location and expression profiles, three crks were identified as candidate genes for the qtl with two of them exhibiting high homology . a previous microarray analysis of the 2hb <dig> nil  <cit>  identified a crk gene  that exhibited similar expression profile as in this study. crks, also known as duf <dig>  rlks, belong to a subfamily of rlks and are characterized by two copies of the c-x8-c-x2-c motif in their extracellular domain  <cit> . expression of crks can be induced by oxidative stress, sa and pathogen infection  <cit> . overexpression of arabidopsis crks conferred enhanced resistance to pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . the crk <dig> mediated resistance to p. syringae was dependent on sa accumulation, and transcriptomic analysis revealed significant overlap between crk <dig> overexpression plants and wild-type plants treated with p. syringae. these results were concordant with our observations. the sa regulated barley homologs of npr <dig> and dir <dig> exhibited increased accumulation in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig> at 48 h after fungal infection. among the up-regulated genes in the r nil versus m <dig> after mock treatment,  <dig>  %  were induced by f. graminearum infection in m <dig> at  <dig> hai. given the function of arabidopsis crks in disease resistance and our transcriptomic data, the three barley crks are promising candidates for the 2hb <dig> qtl and merit further study.

more rapidly induced early-stage defense responses conferred by the 6hb <dig> qtl
the 6hb <dig> qtl confers a minor effect on fhb resistance when compared to the 2hb <dig> qtl and its transcriptomic response to fusarium infection has not been studied. our results indicated that the 6hb <dig> r nil exhibited an earlier induction of a set of genes involved in fhb response , suggesting a sensitized state to f. graminearum infection conferred by the qtl. compared with the 2hb <dig> r nil and m <dig>  the transcriptomic changes between the resistant and susceptible genotypes at the 6hb <dig> qtl after f. graminearum inoculation were limited and occurred mainly during the early-stage of infection . among the  <dig> genes with increased accumulation in the 6hb <dig> r nil compared to lacey after f. graminearum infection at 48 h, many encoded proteins which are associated with resistance to don or f. graminearum . walter et al.  <cit>  reported that a wheat abc transporter contributes to mycotoxin tolerance. we identified  <dig> abc transporters with higher accumulation in the r nil. the expression of hvugt <dig> was higher in the 6hb <dig> r nil than in lacey at  <dig> hai. however, we did not observe a reduced don concentration in the 6hb <dig> r nil compared to lacey at  <dig> hai . one possible explanation is that the inoculation method we used may overwhelm the resistance in the 6hb <dig> r nil. as a result, the two genotypes exhibited no difference in fungal biomass at  <dig> hai. we examined the  <dig> transcripts for candidate genes for the 6hb <dig> qtl. only one transcript was located within the qtl interval, which encoded a protein homologous to a maize f-box domain containing protein .

identification of lncrnas and co-regulation of lncrnas and mrnas in response to f. graminearum infection
recent years have witnessed discoveries of thousands of long noncoding rnas  in plant genomes and a few lncrnas have been shown to regulate vernalization, male sterility and photomorphogenesis . in addition, expression of lncrnas can be altered by abiotic and biotic conditions, suggesting a role of lncrnas in responding to stress  <cit> . zhu et al.  <cit>  identified 20 f. oxysporum responsive intergenic lncrnas  of which five may play a role in resistance. we mined our rna-seq data to identify  <dig>  lncrnas from f. graminearum or water inoculated barley spike samples. hierarchical clustering analyses revealed similar clustering patterns between differentially expressed lincrnas  and degs , indicating that the transcriptional changes of lincrnas and mrnas are highly coordinated in barley-f. graminearum interactions.

correlations between significantly regulated lncrnas and mrnas have been shown in arabidopsis after f. oxysporum infection. in our study, one lncnat  and its sense transcript  and five lincrnas and their neighboring transcripts exhibited co-induction regulation after fungal infection. the lncnat xloc_ <dig> and mloc_ <dig> were both induced in m <dig> after fungal infection at  <dig> hai. the mloc_ <dig> encoded a trichome birefringence-like  protein which was required for cellulose biosynthesis. the tbr and tbl <dig> mutants had decreased cellulose and altered pectin composition  <cit> . cellulose is important for cell wall apposition against pathogen attack and we observed enrichment of cellulose activity in the 2hb <dig> r nil compared to m <dig> at  <dig> hai. thus, the induction of mloc_ <dig> may have a role in disease resistance. it is unclear whether xloc_ <dig> up-regulation has a causal relationship with the induction of mloc_ <dig>  among the five lincrnas and their proximal protein-coding transcripts that exhibited co-induction after fungal infection, one lincrna  was located about 2 kb upstream of a crk  gene on the same strand. the lincrna/mrna pair was transcribed in a divergent fashion. however, whether or how xloc_ <dig> affected the transcription of the crk is unknown and requires further research.

CONCLUSIONS
the current rna-seq analyses of two barley nils carrying resistant fhb qtl alleles revealed the molecular mechanisms of fhb resistance. the 2hb <dig> qtl confers elevated defense response in the absence of f. graminearum infection, which enables the resistant nil to mount an earlier and augmented defense response within 48 h of fungal infection. the transcript levels of the components involved in effector-triggered immunity and pattern-triggered immunity, as well as genes targeting f. graminearum virulence factors, such as don, cell wall degrading enzymes and proteases, accumulated higher in the 2hb <dig> resistant nil when compared to m <dig>  based on expression profiles and function of homologous genes, three cysteine-rich rlk were identified as candidate genes for the 2hb <dig> qtl. the 6hb <dig> qtl mediates an earlier induction of defense genes within 48 h after fungal infection. these genes were involved in don detoxification and cell wall fortification. in addition to mrna profiling, lncrnas were identified from barley spike samples and their differential expression in response to f. graminearum infection were characterized. co-regulation of lncrnas and neighboring mrna suggests that their expression is highly coordinated in response to f. graminearum infection.
