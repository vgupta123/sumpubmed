BACKGROUND
genome-wide histone modification maps have now been generated for a number of eukaryotic organisms. these maps have revealed the preferential localization of specific marks to active or silent chromatin and the association of marks of active transcription with different regions of genes. for example, h <dig> trimethylation on lysine  <dig>  is enriched at the 5' ends of actively transcribed genes while h <dig> trimethylation on lysine  <dig>  is localized towards the 3' ends of coding regions. these localization patterns are related to the roles that the marks play in transcription: h3k4me <dig> regulates the efficiency of transcription initiation and early steps in transcription elongation, and h3k36me <dig> prevents the utilization of cryptic initiation sites in coding regions and controls aspects of transcription termination and processing  <cit> . most eukaryotic genes are modular, containing multiple exons interrupted by introns. genome-wide histone modification maps from c. elegans and human revealed that intron-exon chromatin is also preferentially marked, with transcriptionally active modifications generally excluded from introns and concentrated in exons  <cit> . these studies concluded that this pattern was primarily the consequence of different levels of nucleosome occupancy in these regions because nucleosomes were depleted in introns relative to exons. however, a recent analysis of published human epigenomic data found that  <dig> histone modifications were enriched in the 5' introns of human genes independently of the level of nucleosome occupancy  <cit> . it was suggested that the presence of these marks reflects an aspect of the splicing process such as exon definition and could play a direct role in regulating splicing. thus, the location of intragenic histone modifications and the functional roles associated with different localization patterns remain areas of intense investigation.

one important intragenic histone modification is the monoubiquitylation of h2b . h2b is ubiquitylated co-transcriptionally and in turn regulates the presence of other active chromatin marks during the transcription process, including h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h3k <dig> methylation  <cit> . the presence of h2bk123ub <dig> in chromatin has been associated with both nucleosome stabilization and destabilization. h2bk123ub <dig> and the histone chaperone, spt <dig>  have been shown to function interdependently during transcription elongation to regulate nucleosome reassembly and preserve chromatin integrity  <cit> . biochemical evidence and genomic nucleosome occupancy data also indicate that the presence of h2bk123ub <dig> generally promotes nucleosome stability  <cit> . however, it was recently shown that synthetic nucleosome arrays containing h2bk123ub <dig> are less compact and exhibit an increase in inter-nucleosomal distance, as compared to arrays containing unmodified h2b  <cit> . in addition, two recent reports described a putative role for this modification in mediating chromatin decondensation at dna damage sites  <cit> . thus, h2bk123ub <dig> may differentially affect chromatin structure in a context dependent manner.

in this report, we generated a genome-wide map of h2bk123ub <dig> occupancy in budding yeast to determine if the distribution of this modification could be related to additional biological processes. we found that h2bk123ub <dig> was enriched across gene coding regions and marked both introns and exons of ribosomal protein  genes, and that the level of this mark was further increased at 3' intron-exon boundaries. the presence of h2bk123ub <dig> in introns of rp genes was separable from nucleosome occupancy, which was generally lower in introns compared to exons. in addition, we noted that disruption of h2b ubiquitylation tended to alter the distribution of h3k <dig> trimethylation in intragenic regions. h3k36me <dig> has been functionally linked to pre-mrna splicing in worms and humans  <cit> . furthermore, when an htb-k123r mutation was combined with deletions of lea <dig> and msl <dig>  whose products facilitate u <dig> snrna association with pre-mrna  <cit> , we found a synthetic lethal phenotype. these data suggest that by modulating the distribution of intronic and exonic histone modifications, h2bk123ub <dig> facilitates cross talk between chromatin and pre-mrna splicing.

RESULTS
h2b ubiquitylation is enriched in transcribed regions
previous gene-specific studies in yeast showed that h2bk123ub <dig> is present at genomic regions that are actively transcribed and absent from transcriptionally silent chromatin  <cit> . to map the distribution of h2bk123ub <dig> across the yeast genome, we used the chromatin double immunoprecipitation or chdip technique  <cit>  to detect ha-ubiquitin modified flag-h2b combined with a high-resolution oligonucleotide-tiling array. we then calculated the level of h2bk123ub <dig> relative to the level of h2b to account for the effects of different histone density across the genome. h2bk123ub <dig> was found to be preferentially enriched across transcribed regions in yeast , consistent with its postulated roles in transcriptional elongation  <cit> . these results are similar to those reported in a recent genome-wide study in humans using a monoclonal antibody against vertebrate h2bk120ub <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to its enrichment at coding regions, h2bk123ub <dig> was depleted at intergenic regions and in silent chromatin, including telomeric, rdna and hm loci .

a recent chip-chip study using a polyclonal antibody directed against yeast h2bk123ub <dig> also found that this mark was enriched at gene coding regions  <cit> . we compared the two genome-wide data sets and found almost identical patterns of h2bk123ub <dig> localization at a number of different genomic locations, with somewhat higher levels of h2bk123ub <dig> detected by the chdip method  thus, two different approaches to detect h2bk123ub <dig> lead to the conclusion that this mark is primarily associated with the transcribed regions of genes.

next, we investigated the relationship between h2bk123ub <dig> levels and transcription rate. we found that the level of h2bk123ub <dig> at coding regions was proportional to transcription rate, with the highest levels occurring at genes that have a transcription rate of >  <dig> copies of mrna per hour . genes in this category represent  <dig> %  of the  <dig> genes whose transcription is detectable in rich media   <cit> . the strong correlation between h2bk123ub <dig> levels in coding regions and transcriptional activity suggests that the majority of h2bk123ub <dig> in the yeast genome is established during transcription elongation through the association of the h2b ubiquitylation machinery with elongating rna polymerase ii  <cit> .

intriguingly, the level of h2bk123ub <dig> also showed a correlation with gene length, with higher levels of h2bk123ub <dig> present at genes with longer coding regions . long genes have a higher probability of containing cryptic transcription initiation sites in their coding regions, and increased levels of h3k <dig> methylation at these genes have been correlated with the suppressed utilization of these sites  <cit> . in the case of h3k <dig> methylation, increased levels of the modification are found predominantly at long genes that are infrequently transcribed  <cit> . however, h2bk123ub <dig> is present at long genes with both low and high rates of transcription . we have previously shown that h2bk123ub <dig> plays a role in restoring chromatin structure displaced by elongating rnapii  <cit> . thus, at long genes, the increased levels of h2k123ub <dig> could be important for preventing the utilization of cryptic transcription initiation sites by ensuring nucleosome reassembly. conversely, at shorter genes, where suppression of cryptic transcription is not a general issue, the enrichment of h2bk123ub <dig> at coding regions could serve additional functions, such as regulating the levels of other transcription-related histone modifications or other events in the transcription process  <cit> .

comparison of the genome-wide patterns of h2b ubiquitylation and h3k4me <dig>  h3k79me2/ <dig>  and h3k36me3
histone h <dig> is modified by methylation at lysines  <dig> and  <dig> at its n terminus and at lysine  <dig> in the globular domain of h <dig>  these three h <dig> methylations have been functionally linked to the levels of h2bk123ub <dig>  with h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> di- and tri-methylation levels reduced, and h3k <dig> tri-methylation levels enhanced, in the absence of h2bk123ub <dig>  <cit> . to investigate the links between h2bk123ub <dig> and these h <dig> methylations at the genomic level, we compared the map of h2bk123ub <dig> occupancy to published genome-wide maps of h3k4me <dig>  k36me <dig> and k79me2/me <dig> methylation . by superimposing the genomic profiles of h2bk123ub <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  <cit>  over the average gene and at individual chromosomal loci, we found that the two histone marks occupy distinct regions at yeast genes: h3k4me <dig> peaks at promoters and 5' coding regions, whereas h2bk123ub <dig> levels are very low at promoters and peak over coding regions .

both h3k36me <dig> and h2bk123ub <dig> have been connected to the suppression of internal transcription initiation in gene coding regions  <cit> , and the results discussed above indicate that the two marks are enriched at the coding regions of long genes. the genome-wide and regional distribution patterns of h2bk123ub <dig> and h3k36me <dig> are also similar, with each mark absent from transcription start sites and concentrated along coding regions . however, h3k36me <dig> is more enriched towards the 3' end of coding regions, consistent with its additional roles in 3' end processing  <cit> . finally, a comparison of our h2bk123ub <dig> profile with a recent analysis of h3k79me2/me <dig> genome-wide occupancy  <cit>  confirmed the high degree of co-localization between h2bk123ub <dig> and h3k79me <dig> over gene coding regions  and the general anti-correlation between the distribution of h2bk123ub <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  which is enriched at intergenic regions . however, unlike h2bk123ub <dig>  neither h3k <dig> methylation state correlates closely with transcription rate  <cit> .

h2bk123ub <dig> is present in introns and exons of ribosomal protein genes
next, we sought to determine if the enrichment of h2bk123ub <dig> in coding regions was related to intron-exon architecture in budding yeast. in saccharomyces cerevisiae,  <dig> genes are known to contain introns, and the majority of these genes contain a single intron that is flanked by a small 5' exon  and a large 3' exon. we generated a fine structure map of h2bk123ub <dig> occupancy across the coding regions of these intron-containing genes, with the map of the average intron-containing gene shown in figure 2a. the analysis showed that immediately after the 5' exon-intron boundary, which had a low level of h2bk123ub <dig>  the level of this mark rose gradually and peaked toward the center of the 3' exon. in addition, the level of h2bk123ub <dig> in introns was lower than its level in exons. during the exponential growth of yeast cells, the highly transcribed ribosomal protein  genes represent ~90% of pre-rna splicing events  <cit> . we postulated that the average distribution of h2bk123ub <dig> in all intron-containing genes  might not reflect the pattern of genes with high splicing activity. thus, we separated the intron-containing genes into rp and non-rp genes and repeated the analysis of h2bk123ub <dig> distribution in these two classes of genes . the analysis indicated that in both groups of genes the level of this mark rose immediately after the 5' exon-intron boundary and peaked close to the 3'intron-exon boundary . however, the overall level of h2bk123ub <dig> in rp genes  was significantly higher than in non-rp genes . importantly, similar levels of h2bk123ub <dig> were present in the introns and exons of rp genes , while the level of h2bk123ub <dig> in the introns of non-rp genes was lower than in exons , similar to the pattern of all intron-containing genes . these results suggested that h2b ubiquitylation is enriched in both the introns and exons of rp genes, and that this particular pattern could be related to the high splicing activity of this group of intron-containing genes.

to determine whether chromatin structure contributed to the distribution of h2bk123ub <dig> at intron-containing genes, we utilized published data sets  <cit>  to measure nucleosome occupancy in introns and exons of the these genes . consistent with observations in c. elegans and human  <cit> , we found that nucleosome occupancy in all intron-containing genes was reduced in the intron compared to flanking exons . in addition, the overall nucleosome occupancy in both the introns and exons of rp genes  was generally lower than in the introns of non-rp genes . this is consistent with the observation that highly transcribed genes have lower histone occupancy  <cit> . we validated this nucleosomal pattern at several intron-containing rp genes using a highly accurate, probe-based quantitative pcr protocol. the results showed that both h2b and h <dig> levels were reduced in the introns of these genes compared to exons, indicating that overall nucleosome occupancy is lower in introns .

several reports have provided evidence for the existence of a special chromatin organization that marks introns and exons in the c. elegans and human genomes  <cit> . one of the key findings was that nucleosomes were enriched in exons and decorated with histone modifications that are associated with active transcription, such as h3k36me <dig>  in contrast, nucleosome occupancy and the same histone modifications were generally depleted in introns. these data suggested that there is a functional connection between chromatin organization and the regulation of pre-mrna splicing. our results showing differential nucleosome occupancy between introns and exons in yeast are consistent with the analyses of intragenic nucleosome occupancy in worms and humans  <cit> . however, lower nucleosome occupancy in introns might not fully account for the differences in chromatin structure between introns and exons. another report found that the 5' introns of human genes were enriched for  <dig> different histone modifications, including h2b ubiquitylation, and that this enrichment was separable from nucleosome occupancy  <cit> . because the chdip assay used to detect h2bk123ub <dig> involves the internal normalization of h2bk123ub <dig> to h2b, our data support the view that this histone modification is also enriched in yeast introns compared to exons despite the lower overall occupancy of nucleosomes in introns . furthermore, our results suggest that the elevated level of h2bk123ub <dig> in the introns of rp genes might provide a signal for co-transcriptional splicing.

next, we addressed whether the sharp peak of h2bk123ub <dig> observed at the 3' intron-exon boundary of rp genes  was a special feature of the chromatin structure at these regions. we noted that the average nucleosome occupancy in rp gene introns appeared to be lowest just before the 3' splice site, gradually increasing towards the 3' intron-exon boundary and extending into the 5' region of exon  <dig> . by comparing the profiles of h2bk123ub <dig> and nucleosome occupancy at rp genes , we conclude that the peak of h2bk123ub <dig> at the 3' intron-exon boundary is probably not the consequence of increased nucleosome occupancy in this region. thus, our analysis suggests that the 3' intron-exon boundary of rp genes could contain a signal that facilitates h2bk123ub <dig> deposition or prevents its turnover.

loss of h2b ubiquitylation alters the distribution of h3k <dig> trimethylation in introns
the regulation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h3k <dig> methylation by h2bk123ub <dig> raised the question of whether these marks would also be present in introns as well as exons. the published genome-wide datasets of histone modifications in yeast do not have the resolution to map the distributions of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h3k <dig> methylation at intron-exon boundaries  <cit> . thus, to address this question, we used conventional chip to measure the levels of h3k36me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> at the intron and 3' exon of the same rp genes used to analyze h2bk123ub <dig> . when compared to the levels of h <dig> at these same locations, it is clear that these three h <dig> marks are also enriched in introns , similar to the enrichment of h2bk123ub <dig> . the analysis of h3k36me <dig> levels in human and c. elegans suggested that h3k36me <dig> was enriched in exons and depleted in introns  <cit> ; however, this difference vanished after h3k36me <dig> levels were normalized to nucleosome occupancy  <cit> . this emphasizes that it is essential to consider histone occupancy when comparing histone modification profiles across various genomic regions. interestingly, in the absence of h2bk123ub <dig>  h3k36me <dig> levels were significantly reduced in several rp gene introns  and increased in exons  . because both h3k36me <dig> and h2bk123ub <dig> mark gene-coding regions, it is tempting to speculate that a dynamic balance between the distributions of the two histone marks contributes to the expression of these intron-containing genes. this notion is consistent with previous findings that altered levels of h2b ubiquitylation affect the levels of h3k <dig> methylation at the gal <dig> gene  <cit> . although h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> were also enriched in both introns and exons, we found that h3k4me <dig> was present at higher levels in introns compared to h3k79me <dig> , perhaps reflecting the 5' bias in the distribution of h3k4me <dig> coupled with the typical 5' location of rp introns. together, the data suggest that h2bk123ub <dig> and its downstream marks of h3k36me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k79me <dig> are part of a chromatin architecture that defines rp gene introns.

h2b ubiquitylation genetically interacts with rna processing factors
to determine if the distribution of h2bk123ub <dig> across intron-containing rp genes played a functional role in the regulation of mrna splicing, we first asked if bre <dig>  which encodes the e <dig> ligase that mediates h2bk123ub <dig>  <cit> , showed genetic interactions with genes for rna processing factors. to test this, we examined genetic interaction data for a bre1Δ deletion mutant from biogrid  <cit> , which listed  <dig> interactions. after sorting the interaction data with osprey, a network visualization system  <cit> , we found that bre1Δ showed interactions with mutations in genes encoding  <dig> rna processing factors,  <dig> of which are involved in pre-mrna splicing . intriguingly, the data showed that bre1Δ conferred a synthetic growth defect  when combined with mutations in the genes encoding the u <dig> snrnp component, mud2; the u <dig> snrnp components, spp <dig>  lea <dig> and msl1; and the u4/u6-u <dig> snrnp complex member, prp <dig>  on the other hand, deletion of the capping complex genes, sto <dig> and cbc <dig>  rescued the growth defect of bre1Δ. because bre <dig> genetically interacts with genes encoding many factors related to the regulation of rna processing, this finding suggests that its activity in h2b ubiquitylation could play a role in pre-mrna splicing.

to further address whether h2b ubiquitylation was responsible for the observed bre1Δ interactions with mutations in genes encoding rna processing factors, we combined an htb-k123r mutation, which abolished h2b ubiquitylation, with the following mutations: a deletion of mud <dig>  which encodes a component of the pre-mrna-u <dig> snrnp  <cit> ; a deletion of sac <dig> or edc <dig>  two genes encoding factors with roles in mrna export and mrna decapping  <cit> ; and a deletion of lsm <dig>  which encodes a protein involved in degradation of cytoplasmic mrnas  <cit> . we found that the absence of h2bk123ub <dig> had no effect on the growth of mud <dig>  edc2Δ, sac3Δ and lsm1Δ mutants . however, when htb-k123r was combined with deletions of lea <dig> and msl <dig>  whose products facilitate u <dig> snrna association with pre-mrna  <cit> , we found a synthetic lethal phenotype . a likely interpretation of these genetic interactions is that bre1-mediated h2b ubiquitylation is functionally linked to u <dig> snrnp assembly.

discussion
the positioning of histone modifications at genes has been associated with numerous co-transcriptional processes ranging from initiation to elongation to 3' end processing. in this report, we investigated the genome-wide distribution of h2b monoubiquitylation in budding yeast. we found that h2bk123ub <dig>  a mark of active transcription, is predominantly localized across gene coding regions, consistent with its postulated roles in transcription elongation  <cit> . the mark was also proportional to transcription rate, a likely consequence of the association of the h2b ubiquitylation machinery with elongating rna polymerase ii  <cit> . both of these features are similar to the distribution of h2b monoubiquitylation in the human genome, supporting the view that both the regulation of this histone modification and its functional roles in transcription are evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . we also found a correlation between the levels of h2bk123ub <dig> and gene length, with the mark enriched on long genes. because long genes frequently contain cryptic transcription initiation sites in their coding regions, this correlation supports the view that the presence of h2bk123ub <dig> contributes to the restoration of chromatin structure during transcription elongation to suppress the utilization of these sites  <cit> .

a novel finding of our studies was the discovery that h2bk123ub <dig> is present in both the introns and exons of the yeast ribosomal protein genes which accounts for the majority of splicing events in yeast cells. bioinformatic analyses of genome-wide data sets from worms and humans revealed that exons are enriched with active histone modifications while introns are generally depleted of these same marks  <cit> . this bias has been attributed primarily to chromatin architecture, with nucleosome occupancy higher in exons compared to introns  <cit> . using published data sets on nucleosome occupancy in yeast  <cit> , we found that yeast introns also have reduced nucleosome levels in introns compared to exons. however, this difference does not correlate with a reduction in h2bk123ub <dig> levels in the introns of the rp genes, which account for ~90% of the splicing activity of intron-containing genes  <cit> . the finding that h2bk123ub <dig> is a feature of yeast introns is similar to a recent finding, again from bioinformatic analysis of chromatin modification data sets, that h2b ubiquitylation is one of  <dig> marks of 5' introns in humans  <cit> . most yeast genes with introns contain a single intron that is located close to the 5' end of the coding region  <cit> . thus, the presence of h2b ubiquitylation in the 5' introns of human genes may reflect a similarity in the chromatin architecture of promoter-proximal introns between yeast and human intron-containing genes. we also found that h2bk123ub <dig> peaked at the 3' intron-exon boundary, particularly in the rp genes. we speculate that the chromatin structure of 3' intron-exon boundaries in these genes could carry a signal that enhances the accessibility of the enzymatic machinery that mediates h2b ubiquitylation   <cit> . alternatively, enzymes that target h2b for de-ubiquitylation   <cit>  could be preferentially prevented from associating with these regions. it is currently unclear what feature of chromatin architecture at these boundaries regulates either the deposition or removal of h2b ubiquitylation. likewise, it is not known if this distinct chromatin structure plays a role in transcriptional regulation, including pre-mrna splicing.

h2b ubiquitylation controls the methylation of three lysine residues in histone h <dig> in trans. a comparison of the genome-wide distributions of h2bk123ub <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k79me2/me <dig>  and h3k36me <dig> showed that the four modifications occupy distinct regions in genes. as previously reported, h3k123ub <dig> and h3k79me <dig> co-localize across coding regions, while h2bk123ub <dig> and h3k79me <dig> show an anti-correlation at intergenic regions  <cit> . h3k4me <dig> is localized predominantly at 5' gene regions, while h3k36me <dig>  like h2bk123ub <dig>  spreads across coding regions, but with a more pronounced enrichment at the 3' end of genes. how h2bk123ub <dig> controls these particular distribution patterns remains an area of intense investigation  <cit> . h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  like h2bk123ub <dig>  were also present in the introns of five ribosomal protein genes that were analyzed, and all of these marks were separable from nucleosome occupancy. together, the results are similar to the reported presence of h2b ubiquitylation and h3k79me <dig> in the 5' introns of humans  <cit> .

unlike the situation in humans and worms  <cit> , h3k36me <dig> is present in both the introns and exons of yeast genes. the restricted presence of h3k36me <dig> in exons in higher eukaryotic genomes has been correlated with the regulation of alternative mrna splicing  <cit> . these observations suggest two possible roles for h3k36me <dig> in pre-mrna splicing, and specifically in the regulation of pre-rna splicing. first, h3k36me <dig> could mark exons as a part of a gene structure and along with cis-splicing elements facilitate the decision of whether to include a specific exon  <cit> . alternatively, h3k36me <dig> could act as an anchor site for recruiting splicing factors that regulate alternative mrna splicing  <cit> . however, in the yeast genome, the majority of intron-containing genes contain a single intron, and the regulation of splicing efficiency is thus more important than alternative mrna splicing. it has been suggested that splicing efficiency is a function of the rate of rna polymerase ii elongation. this scenario is supported by a recent finding that rnap ii pauses transiently around the 3'end of introns and that this pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment  <cit> . thus, the presence of histone marks in both introns and exons might promote splicing efficiency by controlling rna polymerase ii elongation. the finding that h2bk123ub <dig> levels are enhanced at 3' intron-exon boundaries could provide a mechanism to couple rnapii elongation to the recruitment of splicing factors. moreover, the dynamic relationship between the levels of h2bk123ub <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in introns and exons supports a redundant mechanism to ensure optimal rnap ii elongation, in turn promoting efficient pre-mrna splicing.

because the loss of h2b ubiquitylation, h3k4/k <dig> methylation, or h3k <dig> methylation does not compromise cell viability, the histone modifications cannot play an essential role in splicing. we suggest that the presence of these marks in introns, together with reduced nucleosome occupancy in these regions, are part of a chromatin architecture that facilitates the recognition of exons and introns by splicing regulators. further support for this mechanism comes from the observation that a synthetic lethal phenotype resulted from combining an htb-k123r mutation with deletions of genes with roles in pre-mrna splicing, specifically in u <dig> splicesome assembly. for example, the histone modifications might serve as binding sites for proteins that in turn interact with splicing factors. such a scenario has been proposed for h3k4me <dig> and the chd <dig> protein, which contains a chromodomain that recognizes the methyl mark and interacts with the u <dig> snrnp complex in both humans and yeast to promote efficient splicing  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the co-transcriptional formation of h2bk123ub <dig> leads to its spread across gene coding regions. this mark in turn defines the distribution of h3k <dig> tri-methylation at the 5' end of coding regions and h3k <dig> tri-methylation toward the center of coding regions during the processes of transcription initiation and elongation. h2bk123ub <dig> also marks introns, and its presence in these regions leads to the presence of h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> at the introns of several ribosomal protein genes examined. the presence of h2bk123ub <dig> also influences the distribution of h3k36me <dig> across coding regions, particularly in introns. as a consequence, we suggest that this coordinated pattern of histone marks along transcribed regions facilitates the recognition of exons and introns and allows for efficient co-transcriptional pre-mrna processing.
