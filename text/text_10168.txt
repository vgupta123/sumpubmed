BACKGROUND
recombination rate can vary dramatically among species, among chromosomes within species, among regions within chromosomes, and among individuals and families within regions in mammals  <cit> . these variations may have important consequences for the accuracy of marker assisted selection, genetic diagnosis and for the success of positional cloning or positional identification of disease gene and quantitative trait loci   <cit> . noor et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that variance in recombination rate across a genome can cause systematic biases in the interpretation of mapping results.

the mammalian x chromosome contains a disproportionately high number of genes and qtl influencing development, female/male fertility, reproduction and diseases , notably in pigs http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/qtldb/ss/draw_chromap?chromos=x. for example, milan et al.  <cit>  detected a few major qtl on the porcine x chromosome  that explained more than 40% of the f <dig> phenotypic variation for backfat weight and muscle contents in a large white × meishan pig resource population. identification of causal genes underlying these qtl could have great economic significance for the pig industry. it could also provide very valuable insights into the genetic regulation of fat deposition in mammals. however, this purpose can hardly be achieved because, so far, little is known about between-region, individual and family variation in recombination that occurs on ssc-x.

the increasing wealth of genetic and physical mapping data makes it possible to detail precisely patterns of recombination on ssc-x. the larger the family, the more reliable is the estimate of genetic distance. physical distance between markers can be estimated by radiation-hybrid  mapping, while its exact value will be determined on the complete genome sequence  <cit> .

sperm typing studies have revealed significant variations between individual human males  <cit>  and between individual bulls  <cit>  in the fine-scale rate of crossing over. such studies, however, can only be performed on male recombination, so the only access to fine-scale patterns of female recombination could only be obtained through a classical analysis of families  <cit> . a valuable case for such a study is the x chromosome, because it is only there that female recombination occurs in the absence of male recombination  <cit> . so far, pedigree studies have identified variation in the global recombination rate  among mothers and have shown that the variation is heritable, suggesting that there are some underlying components determined by both genetic and environment factors that affect maternal recombination rates  <cit> . however, no study to date has documented the variation in fine-scale rate among females, due to the limited number of children per mother  <cit> . fortunately, the higher fertility of the pig compared to other mammalian species effectively increases the sample size of meiotic products that can be obtained from individual females, permitting direct comparisons between animals.

heterogeneity in recombination rate between the same loci on different linkage maps may represent genetic variation in some aspects of the meiotic recombination machinery among individuals of different mapping pedigrees. this variation may be multifactorial, including differences in sex, genetic background, haplotype, age, recombination-promoting sequences, chromosome size, sequence homology, and sites for initiation of chromosome pairing  <cit> . for instance, the presence of recombination hotspots within mouse major histocompatibiltiy complex  have been detected in some specific mhc haplotypes  <cit> , therefore the frequency of recombination in this region can vary among individuals or strains carrying different haplotypes.

previously, large white ♂ × chinese meishan ♀  and white duroc ♂ × chinese erhualian ♀  f <dig> intercross populations were established by inra in france  <cit>  and jiangxi agricultural university  in china  <cit> , respectively. based on the large number of offspring  per f <dig> sow, we were able to estimate recombination rate over x chromosome intervals by comparing genetic and physical maps. then we studied the degree of heterogeneity in broad-scale and fine-scale recombination rate between individual f <dig> females, and finally compare these relationships to differences in maternal and paternal haplotypes of f <dig> females transmitted from chinese and european f <dig> founders.

RESULTS
estimation of the most likely marker order and regional variation in recombination rate along ssc-x based on comparison of maps
we used a total number of  <dig> markers in this study. among them  <dig> were developed for this study . in addition to  <dig> previous ones,  <dig> new markers were mapped on the inra-university of minnesota porcine  radiation hybrid panel. twenty-eight and  <dig> markers were mapped using the inra and jxau families respectively;  <dig> of these were mapped using both pedigrees. the sequence of  <dig> markers matched sequences from sscrofa <dig> assembly available on the ensembl website, and  <dig> marker-containing bac clones were anchored on the human physical map. table  <dig> shows the positions of markers on the porcine cytogenetic map, clone map, genetic map and rh map and on the human physical map. the consensus order was chosen as the order consistent with the majority of the maps. there is a very high conservation of marker order between the human physical map and the pig clone map, except for two small segments . for these two segments, both the current swine genetic map and the rh map support the marker orders determined using the human physical map rather than those using the pig clone map, suggesting possible mistakes in the pig sequence assembly, unless chromosome inversions occurred in the dna of the duroc pig selected for sequencing.

1the most likely marker order was determined as the common order shared by most of maps.

8bold numbers indicate that the marker orders in two segments  on ssc-x clone map are inconsistent with those on the rh map, genetic maps and hsa-x physical map.

9bold numbers indicate that the markers  were in reverse order on the usda-marc map versus the current genetic maps or other maps.

an accurate genetic map is crucial for qtl analysis  <cit> . notably, the present marker segment sw259-sw1994-sw1426-sw <dig> observed on both inra and jxau genetic maps is reversed on the usda-marc genetic map  <cit>  , but is in accordance with both physical and rh maps, supporting the accuracy of our linkage map. moreover, as mentioned previously by mccoard et al.  <cit> , sw <dig> was also placed wrongly on the usda genetic map, which is revealed by its location on rh and physical maps .

the inra genetic map covered most of the chromosome length from sw <dig>  to s <dig> . the ratio between the genetic and physical map is of  <dig>  cm/mb . two additional markers sw <dig> and sw <dig> located at both ends in the xp24/yp pseudoautosomal region and xq <dig> respectively were also mapped on jxau families. the region from sw <dig> to sw <dig> covers  <dig> mb and  <dig> cm on jxau genetic map , thus corresponding to an overall average recombination rate of  <dig>  cm/mb.

regional variation in recombination rate along ssc-x is shown on figure  <dig>  patterns of recombination appear very similar in the two populations. however, there are marked differences in the recombination rate between ssc-x regions. an extensive region  of very low recombination rate is especially striking . between sw <dig> and umnp <dig>  and perhaps extending to umnp <dig>  a fragment of more than  <dig> mb represents only  <dig> - <dig>  cm , which corresponds to a ratio of  <dig>  cm/mb. only one recombination event out of  <dig> meioses from the inra population occurred in this region, between sw <dig> and sw <dig>  there were  <dig> recombination events out of  <dig> meioses in the jxau population, occurring in the  <dig> fragments flanked by markers sw <dig>  sw <dig>  umnp <dig> and umnp <dig> 

two regions  flanking the recombination coldspot, as well as the xq telomeric region , show a rate of  <dig> - <dig>  cm/mb, which was more than two-fold the value observed over the whole chromosome. the three regions may harbor recombination hotspots. indeed, the fragment mcse231m24-mcst96o <dig> within the region c presents an even higher ratio . in order to precisely map the potential recombination hotspot, we developed two additional microsatellite markers  using the available partial sequence of one bac clone  located in this region. as the fragment between the two markers is ~ <dig> kb long and as it spans ~ <dig>  cm on inra genetic map , the recombination rate increases to  <dig>  cm/mb in this segment.

variability of recombination rate between f <dig> females and populations
identification of linkage heterogeneity in different regions of > <dig> cm on ssc-x
we initially detected heterogeneity in recombination fraction  for large regions among f <dig> sows of the inra family using morton's likelihood ratio test  <cit>  . significant differences among the  <dig> f <dig> sows were observed only in three noncontiguous intervals defined by sw1903-sw <dig> , by umnp71-sw <dig>  and by sw1608-s <dig> , denoted respectively lh- <dig>  lh-c and lh- <dig> on figure  <dig>

4the θ of the f <dig> full-sisters within the first subfamily for the interval umnp71-sw <dig> are highlighted in bold because they showed the largest difference in θ .

5probability for inter-individual variability of θ.

for the jxau population, individual variability of θ among  <dig> f <dig> females was significant for the three intervals sw949-sw <dig> , sw2456-sw <dig> , sw1943-sw <dig> . however, only lh-c  and lh- <dig>  regions exhibit linkage heterogeneity when considering only the  <dig> f <dig> females having at least  <dig> offspring.

for all the regions of ssc-x, no significant difference was identified between the average rates calculated on inra and jxau families, except for the interval sw980-sw <dig> . this interval covers a distance of  <dig>  cm in the inra population in contrast to  <dig>  cm in the jxau population , resulting in recombination rates of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm/mb respectively . this result agrees with previous observations showing that large-scale recombination pattern and hotspots tend to be conserved among human populations  <cit> .

fine mapping of the fragment showing linkage heterogeneity within the region umnp71-sw1943
the interval umnp71-sw <dig>  is of particular interest to us, because its linkage heterogeneity was highly significant in both populations and because many qtl have been mapped around this area http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/qtldb/ss/draw_chromap?chromos=x. we tried to narrow down this region that showed linkage heterogeneity using additional markers. in the inra population, only one sub-interval umnp891-umnp <dig>  exhibited statistically significant linkage heterogeneity among f <dig> females, whereas other areas umnp71-sw <dig> , sw1426-umnp <dig>  and umnp93-sw <dig>  did not. therefore, the variation observed on the sub-interval umnp891-umnp <dig> explains most of the difference observed on the region as a whole.

1in the region umnp891-umnp <dig>   <dig> microsatellite markers  and  <dig> snps were genotyped. for simplicity, we indicated the haplotypes with only microsatellites alleles because they reveal all individual haplotypes formed by all markers analysed on these animals.

2each sub-family consists of f <dig> full-sisters.

3the θ of the f <dig> full-sisters within the first subfamily are highlighted in bold because they showed the largest difference in θ .

similarly, significant difference in θ for the interval umnp891-umnp <dig>  was also observed among f <dig> females from jxau population. unfortunately, in this population, umnp <dig> was not informative for some f <dig> females and umnp <dig> was not genotyped for all samples. thus, the heterogeneity was tested and confirmed on a larger set of meioses using the two flanking markers mcst96o <dig> and mcsi0244d <dig> . linkage heterogeneity was not detected in other intervals umnp71-sw <dig> , sw1426-mcst96o <dig>  and mcsi0244d12-sw <dig> . relatively higher p values in these sub-intervals obtained therein could explain why linkage heterogeneity for the overall interval umnp71-sw <dig> was less significant in the jxau population than in the inra population.

variation in recombination fraction for the interval umnp891-umnp <dig> within an inra family consisting of  <dig> f <dig> full-sisters
the most significant difference in θ for the interval umnp891-umnp <dig> among f <dig> full-sisters was observed in the subfamily no. <dig> . all f <dig> full-sisters inherited the same paternal x chromosome from lw boars whereas they inherited one or the other maternal x chromosome from ms sows. we noticed that in the subfamily no. <dig>  three f <dig> full-sisters  carrying the same maternal haplotype  within the interval umnp891-umnp <dig> tended to have higher θ . among these three full-sisters, the relatively low recombination rate observed for  <dig> in this interval may result from interference because a high crossover rate was observed in the neighboring region . in contrast, the last full-sister  <dig> inherited the other maternal haplotype  and had no recombination in this region at all. no other f <dig> females carried the haplotype  <dig>  however, 910013's relatives  <dig> and  <dig> who also carried the maternal haplotype  <dig> also exhibited very low θ . based on the knowledge of parental relationship since the importation of meishan animals in france and of the genotypes obtained on some key meishan ancestors, we can show that the haplotype  <dig> observed in the three females  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is highly likely to represent an identical by descent  ,.

impact of maternal and paternal haplotypes on recombination rate variation
seventeen f <dig> females from the inra population were grouped by their maternal  or paternal  haplotypes in the interval umnp891-umnp <dig>  respectively . the linkage heterogeneity is strongly significant among sets of f <dig> females grouped according to the chinese haplotype inherited from their mother , whereas no heterogeneity is observed when f <dig> females are grouped according to the european haplotype inherited from their father . the θ for haplotype  <dig> and  <dig> differed by more than fourteen-fold . we indentified after genotyping additional snps, that the only one recombination  occurring in a  <dig> haplotype happened at the end of segment between markers be371l5-0001y <dig> and be219e21-0003m <dig>  thus globally, no recombination occurred in approximately  <dig> mb in the haplotype  <dig> in the  <dig> meiotic events. the most frequent maternal haplotype found in f <dig> females was  <dig>  with an average θ of  <dig> %, a value equivalent to the average θ for all haplotypes.

similar results for linkage heterogeneity were obtained from the jxau population for the interval mcst96o22-mcsi0244d <dig> . all jxau f <dig> females were grouped into two paternal half-sib families according to only two wd boars  mated with er sows. no significant difference  in θ was found between these two groups of families. within each of the two groups, when f <dig> females were also grouped according to the haplotype inherited from their erhulian mother, a significant difference was put in evidence within the 0f <dig> family  but not in the 0f <dig> family . this latter result might be simply due to a smaller sample size for the 0f <dig> family. the θ for the same maternal haplotypes  from different paternal families did not differ significantly . almost no common chinese haplotype in this interval was shared between f <dig> females of inra and jxau populations.

1the haplotypes are formed by microsatellite markers  within the interval of interest.

2maternal haplotypes in bold are common to f <dig> females from both 0f <dig> and 0f <dig> families. the number between brackets represents the haplotype over the core umnp891-umnp <dig> interval.

discussion
comparative map
to date, the pig rh map - human comparative map is not available for x/y chromosomes in the pig qtl database http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/qtldb/ss/link_rh2hs?chromos=x, therefore the snp sequence matches to the human genome cannot be easily aligned to the qtl map. here, we provide the links between the pig rh map, the pig clone map and the human physical map. these will facilitate the search for candidate genes for traits of interest by fine comparison of the porcine regions with corresponding segments of human genome, and will enable to understand the evolution of these chromosomes. comparison of the pig and human x chromosome maps revealed remarkable conservation of sequence order along the entire x chromosomes, including the location of the centromere. this is the same case for horse x chromosome  <cit> , whereas some breakpoints and chromosomal rearrangements were found when comparing mouse and human or cow and human x chromosomes. .

regional variation in recombination rate
in the present study, we identified considerable variation in regional recombination along ssc-x. a large recombination coldspot adjacent to the centromere of x chromosome has been previously reported for human  <cit>  and suggested for pig by alignment of the usda linkage and cytogenetic maps  this study not only confirms that this coldspot exists in pigs, but also estimates its extent  and recombination fraction , which is likely to be longer and "colder" than the counterparts in other mammals. in humans, the coldspot is  <dig> mb and  <dig> cm in size  <cit> . the coldspot can not be completely explained by a "centromere effect", as the centromere is only at one end of the coldspot. shashi et al.  <cit>  reported a three-generation human family with a large pericentric inversion of the x chromosome. recombination was observed only at the telomeric regions xp <dig> and xq27- <dig>  outside the inverted region, and fertility was not obviously affected in the carriers of this inversion. whether there is a chromosomal inversion on ssc-x in european or chinese pigs, leading to low recombination will need further investigation.

in rat and mouse, the x chromosome has lower recombination rate than the autosomal average and hsa-x has a rate very near the human genome-wide average  <cit> , whereas we found that the average rate across ssc-x was a bit higher than the global level of the pig genome . this might be attributable to several regions of higher recombination that would compensate for the large region of low recombination on ssc-x. such possible regions mainly distribute at neighborhood sites of the coldspot and near telomeres. we fine mapped such a hotspot in the clone ch242-12p <dig> within the ssc-xq <dig> region, with a rate as high as  <dig>  cm/mb. the smaller the interval examined, the greater the regional variation in recombination rate. on the hsa-x,  <dig> hotspots mapped within  <dig> kb  <cit> . hotspots are not conserved among species  <cit> .

inter-individual, inter-family and inter-population variation in recombination rate
we noticed two differences between the inra and jxau results. first, the genetic length of the interval sw980-sw <dig> differed significantly between the two populations . second, some intervals  that showed significant linkage heterogeneity among individuals were population-specific.

on the other hand, there are strikingly consistent findings that the individual variability of recombination rate in the interval umnp891-umnp <dig> is significant in both populations. to our knowledge, the present study is the first to provide evidence of differences in fine-scale recombination rate among females, supporting the fact that genome-wide recombination rate varies substantially among women  <cit> .

haplotype effect on recombination
some early studies have documented that meiotic recombination in the mhc region is likely to depend on haplotypes  <cit> . now, we found the distribution of crossovers in the interval umnp891-umnp <dig> also obeys this principle. moreover, the recombination variation in this interval was only associated with the maternal haplotypes  rather than the paternal haplotypes  of f <dig> females. due to the structure of the two pedigrees used in this study, it is not possible to formally differentiate a haplotypic effect from a parental effect . however, a haplotypic effect among the different asian haplotypes seems the most plausible explanation for the findings. such an effect could be explained by a simple global inversion of ~ <dig> mb in the haplotype  <dig> or by differences in the sequence of the different haplotypes. cytogenetic analysis will be further required, but we don't think that all differences in the recombination rate could be explained by a simple chromosomal fragment inversion as differences in the recombination rate are identified in both populations, whereas the chinese haplotypes in segregating in both populations are completely different. we were not able to provide this cytogenetic evidence for the animals of this study as we did not froze cells to prepare metaphases. the differences in the recombination rate among haplotypes might be due to dna sequence divergence in chinese pigs, different chromatin structure, imprinting and/or their interactions. at present we cannot rule out any possibilities. the genetic basis of recombination variation has not been fully understood. for humans, specific dna motifs and repeats are strongly associated with recombination rate, while there is no association between recombination rate and dnasei hypersensitivity  <cit> . the evidence for a link between imprinting and recombination rate is currently weak  <cit> . the future availability of the porcine reference sequence will likely help us to understand the basis of this linkage heterogeneity.

consequence of variation in recombination rate for qtl mapping
low recombination in almost one-fourth of the length of ssc-x is a serious problem for interpretation of qtl mapping results and fine mapping of these qtl, as many genes in the "cold" region could be associated with a quantitative trait. in fact, a noticeable clustering of qtl, especially of the "major" qtl, is observed near the centromere . this might be attributable to the extraordinary high gene density per centimorgan in the region with different genes with polygenic effect acting as a single strong qtl effect. this situation would be consistent with the conclusion made on humans by boyle et al.  <cit> . in that case, if the causative mutations can not be identified, the haplotype block could be globally eliminated or selected in marker assisted selection programs. for qtl mapped in a region of low recombination, haplotype analysis and association studies, combined with the careful comparison of qtl effects identified in different populations, might provide more valuable information than linkage analysis; yet identifying the causative mutations is unlikely to be achieved through these approaches  <cit> . additional strategies, such as expression qtl  mapping, may enhance gene-mapping efforts.

the presence of inter-individual, inter-family and inter-population variation in recombination rate can also bias conclusions from genetic mapping studies. for qtl in the region where heterogeneity in recombination rate occurs, the estimation of position and effect of qtl are both altered by the differences between the average linkage map and the true recombination pattern of each f <dig> females, subfamilies or populations. nevertheless, the consequences of individual variation need not always be negative  <cit> . it could lead to the identification of either chromosomal variation or modifier genes linked or unlinked to the interval under study, and perhaps yield new insight into the mechanism of mutation  <cit> . a general role of dna repeats in mediating disease-causing recombination errors has been suggested  <cit> . if reduced recombination is a common result of sequence mismatch in the mutated region, this could even become a new positional mapping approach--that is, screening carriers for perturbed recombination  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we provide the first published comparative map by integrating marker sequence positions of both pig and human chromosome x. the comparative map confirms the conservation of synteny between ssc-x and hsa-x, and will be valuable for selection of candidate genes for porcine qtl that map to ssc-x. large differences in broad- and fine-scale recombination rate along ssc-x and between f <dig> females were revealed, which may cause unpredictable difficulties to precisely estimate the position and effect of individual causative gene. recombination variation over the interval umnp891-umnp <dig> was associated with maternal haplotype of asian origin of f <dig> females. a future comparison of sequences of these haplotypes will be very interesting to identify the cause of these variations

globally, our results highlight the necessity of careful fine mapping of qtl identified in segregation in pig breeds on ssc-x relatively to coldspot, hotspot and lh regions identified in this study.
