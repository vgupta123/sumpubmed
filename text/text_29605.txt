BACKGROUND
the anopheles culicifacies mosquito is the main vector of the human malaria parasite, p. vivax, in the indian sub-continent and is responsible for approximately 65% of new malaria cases annually  <cit> . the natural transmission cycle of plasmodium parasite requires successful completion of a complex sporogonic cycle in the midgut and the salivary glands of the anopheles mosquito, a process that takes place over a period of two weeks. this developmental cycle can be blocked by the innate immune responses of the mosquito thereby resulting in the elimination of pathogen in the vector itself  <cit> .

mosquito vectors differ in their efficiency of transmitting malaria; some are refractory and completely block transmission of parasite  <cit> . naturally evolved and genetically selected refractory strains are important for the study of mechanisms that mediate plasmodium killing  <cit> . genetically selected susceptible and refractory strains  are described in african mosquito anopheles gambiae  <cit> . the r strain blocks parasite development by melanotically encapsulating the ookinetes after invasion of the midgut  <cit> . understanding the molecular basis of such refractory phenotypes may contribute to the development of novel strategies for malaria control, which would rely on elimination of the parasite in the mosquito itself.

recently, adak et al.  reported the isolation of a naturally occurring field strain of a. culicifacies that is 100% refractory to p. vivax and partially resistant to p. falciparum and p. vinckei   <cit> . in the r strain, brown capsular ookinetes characteristic of the melanization reaction were microscopically observed in the mosquito midgut within  <dig> hours of plasmodium – infected blood feeding. normal uncoated ookinetes were observed in the s strain indicating that strain refractoriness in a. culicifacies could be attributed to melanotic encapsulation of ookinetes. the melanotic capsule consists of a proteinaceous poly-quinone material surrounding the parasite and killing of the parasite may be mediated by toxic byproducts of the melanization cascade reactions, such as free radicals or by starvation within the capsule  <cit> .

the melanization reaction starts with a modulatory serine protease cascade, leading to proteolytic cleavage and activation of prophenoloxidases  to phenoloxidases , the key enzymes for melanin production  <cit> . in addition, serine proteases are also involved in signaling and amplification cascades that lead to the activation of specific defense mechanisms, such as melanization, coagulation and induction of anti-microbial peptides. an increasing number of serine proteases involved in immune responses have been isolated and characterized from a. gambiae. the majority of these serine proteases are present in the hemolymph and expressed by hemocytes. in a. gambiae, clipb <dig>  clipb <dig> and clipb <dig> serine proteases are induced during immune responses and have sequences characteristic of prophenoloxidase activating enzymes  <cit> . the role of several of these proteases in melanization and killing of parasites has been examined by rna interference  <cit> .

in the present study, we report the isolation of a serine protease  from the body tissue of a. culicifacies. acsp <dig> was poorly transcribed in the s strain whereas abundant transcript was observed in the r strain. expression of acsp <dig> was constitutive in both the strains but was strongly upregulated upon parasite invasion in the r strain. although, the nucleotide sequence of acsp <dig> cdna and genomic clone were identical in r and s strains, a significant sequence divergence of upstream regions was observed. the promoter in r and s strains was localized within - <dig> bp of the translation initiation site; quantification of promoter strength by the luciferase-based reporter gene assay revealed a  <dig> -fold higher activity in the r strain compared to the s strain. our studies suggest divergent promoter sequences recruit differential transcription factors resulting in a varied expression of acsp <dig> in the r and s strains. in addition, differential distribution of nuclear proteins in the two strains could also contribute to disparity in acsp <dig> transcription.

RESULTS
cloning and analysis of acsp <dig> of a. culicifacies
a pcr-based strategy was employed to isolate the serine protease-encoding gene  from the body tissue  of a. culicifacies. the  <dig> bp full-length cdna encoded a  <dig> amino acid protein, acsp <dig>  corresponding to molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda. computer-assisted analysis revealed that the first  <dig> amino acids of acsp <dig> constituted a signal peptide and the next  <dig> form a propeptide. mature acsp <dig>   <dig> amino acids in length possessed structural elements characteristic of all serine proteases such as the conserved catalytic triad  and six cysteine residues .

by using the clustalw alignment program , the deduced amino acid sequence of acsp <dig> was aligned with reported sequences from other insects. acsp <dig> showed highest sequence similarity  with a predicted serine protease  from a. gambiae genome . amongst the reported a. gambiae serine proteases, the acsp <dig> showed maximum similarity with agsp24d    <cit> . acsp <dig> also shared sequence similarity with serine proteases from chrysomia bezziana  , drosophila yakuba  and culex quinquefasciatus  which are reported to function in dissolution of fibrin of blood clots and as proteolytic factors in a variety of processes including embryonic development, tissue remodeling, tumor invasion and inflammation  <cit> . interestingly, acsp <dig> shared low  sequence homology with the clip-domain serine proteases  that are implicated in defense mechanisms in insects  <cit> .

differential expression of serine protease in r and s strains
the relative expression level of acsp <dig> transcript in five-day old naïve adult female mosquitoes of the r and s phenotypes was analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr  and real-time pcr  using β-actin as an internal control. though acsp <dig> was expressed constitutively in the r and s strains, there was a significant difference in their expression levels. in naïve adult female mosquitoes, transcript levels of acsp <dig> were 40-fold higher in the r strain compared to s. acsp <dig> was expressed constitutively during development of mosquito; a varying pattern of expression was observed from second instar larvae to pupa. a dramatic 300-fold increase in acsp <dig> transcript was observed in the second instar larvae as compared to the levels present in the adult mosquito .

immune responses to plasmodium infection
both refractory and susceptible 4– <dig> day old adult female mosquitoes were separately fed on blood of balb/c mice infected with plasmodium vinckei petteri. the refractory a. culicifacies mosquito strain is partially resistant to the rodent malarial parasite  <cit> . mosquitoes fed on blood of uninfected mice were included as blood-fed controls. temporal expression of acsp <dig> was monitored by real-time pcr at regular intervals after feeding . in the r strain, a 68-fold increase in acsp <dig> transcript level was observed  <dig> hours after feeding on uninfected blood. mosquitoes fed with infected blood exhibited a 300-fold increase in the transcript levels over the naïve unfed female mosquitoes. the  <dig> hour post-feeding upregulation of acsp <dig> expression coincided with microscopic observation of encapsulated plasmodium ookinetes in the midgut of the r strain. in contrast, the expression levels of the acsp <dig> remained unaltered upon feeding uninfected or parasite-infected blood in the s strain .

structural analysis of acsp <dig> upstream regulatory sequences from r and s strains
the cdna corresponding to the acsp <dig> was cloned from both r and s strains and sequenced. a comparison of the two sequences did not reveal any difference between the two strains. since the cdna sequence of acsp <dig> was identical in both the strains, we isolated the corresponding genomic dna using pcr. the  <dig> bp gdna fragment was slightly bigger than the cdna indicating the presence of an intron. sequence analysis revealed that the gene has a single intron of  <dig> bp at its 5' end and is a phase  <dig> intron. since the location and the sequence of the intron were identical in both the strains, the upstream sequences of acsp <dig> were isolated and evaluated for promoter activity.

using a pcr-based directional genome walking protocol, regions upstream to ascp <dig> were cloned from r and s strains. amplicons of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb were obtained in the r and s strains respectively. upstream sequences  from the r and s strains were aligned by clustalw using macvector  and emboss-align . a high degree of sequence similarity  was observed up to  <dig> bp, upstream of the translational start site . beyond this region there was a considerable divergence in the gene sequence. the region between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp showed 54% similarity with  <dig> % gaps and only 30% similarity was observed in the region between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp with  <dig> % gaps .

in silico analysis of the upstream sequences of acsp <dig> revealed characteristics of rna polymerase ii-transcribed promoters. using the computer-based promoter prediction tool, two putative transcription start sites were predicted to be located at - <dig> bp  and - <dig> bp  upstream of atg in r and s strains. the region surrounding this transcription start point corresponded to the arthropod initiator sequence, which is found in the interval - <dig> to + <dig> of 25% of arthropod rna polymerase ii-transcribed promoters as described by cherbas and cherbas   <cit> . this reinforced the prediction of this site as the true transcription start site. in both strains, two tata motifs were found at position - <dig> and - <dig> from the atg and two arthropod transcription initiator motifs tcagt  <cit>  were present at position - <dig> and - <dig>  using the consensus dcakty  <cit> , putative capsite was found at position - <dig> and - <dig> respectively in the r and s strains. these sites constituted the putative core promoter elements .

regulatory sequence motifs in both the strains were searched from within the insect family using the matinspector program  <cit>  and  <dig> consensus matches were detected in the s strain and  <dig> in the r strain, all of which were based on factors present in drosophila. in the s strain, the  <dig> different matrices were well distributed along the entire  <dig> bp upstream region but in the r strain such motifs were absent in the region between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp and the  <dig> matrices were restricted to the - <dig> to - <dig> bp region. a comparative analysis of putative binding sites is depicted in table  <dig> 

the upstream regulatory sequences of the r and s strains were also scanned for putative vertebrate regulatory elements. several interesting motifs were found in these regions. computer-assisted analysis revealed motifs which were homologous to the response elements for transcription factors described in the promoters of other insect immune-responsive genes and mammalian acute-phase protein genes and are listed in table  <dig> <cit> . of the several motifs listed, an interesting observation relates to the two potential regulatory motifs for the ecdysone responsive element    <cit> . in the r strain, ecre are located at positions - <dig> to - <dig> bp  and - <dig> to - <dig> bp  on the plus strand while only one such motif was located in the s strain at a position identical to the r strain . at present, it is difficult to assess the consequences of these differences on the refractory phenotype, a detailed mutational and deletion analysis is necessary to study the significance of these observations.

functional analysis of the acsp <dig> promoter in r and s strains
based on the homology of upstream sequences of acsp <dig> between r and s strains, two regions were selected for evaluating the promoter activity. the region spanning - <dig> to - <dig> bp showed 94% similarity and the other region spanning - <dig> to - <dig> bp showed 72% similarity. these regions from the r and s strains were cloned in promoterless pgl3-basic vector containing firefly luciferase reporter gene and transfected into drosophila s <dig> cells. the luciferase activity from all the four constructs was higher than that of the vector  and control  suggesting that the upstream gene sequences from r and s strains contain regulatory elements for their respective promoters . the two constructs pgl3-ref <dig> and pgl3-sus <dig> yielded similar levels of luciferase activity, while pgl3-ref <dig> from the r strain showed  <dig> -fold increase in luciferase activity compared to the s strain.

differential binding of nuclear proteins to acsp <dig> upstream sequences from r and s strains
the increase in promoter activity in the r strain was attributed to sequence differences within the  <dig> bp region spanning - <dig> to - <dig> bp upstream of the start codon. to determine the effect of such differences on the binding of nuclear proteins, electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed. emsa experiments with three different probes  allowed us to determine the minimum upstream region that shows difference in binding of nuclear proteins and thus might be responsible for differential expression of acsp <dig> in the two strains. emsas using nuclear extracts from the r strain and r400/s <dig> probe revealed two complexes, a sharp slow migrating band, complex a and a faster moving diffused band, complex b . both the complexes were observed when r <dig> probe was incubated with nuclear extract from r strain . interestingly, formation of complex b was nearly abolished on r <dig> probe but complex a formation remained unaffected . these results clearly indicated that the  <dig> bases  missing in r <dig> probe were critical for the assembly of transcription factors forming complex b but the  <dig> bp upstream region  was important and sufficient for binding of nuclear proteins forming complex a.

in general, the binding of nuclear proteins to probes derived from the s strain was less compared to that from the r strain, which further emphasized the importance of differences in upstream regions of acsp <dig> from both the strains. the greater intensity of the bands with the r probes showed that the formation of both the complexes was more on r probe than s; an approximately 25% increase in dna binding activity of both the complexes was observed on r <dig> as compared to s <dig> probe. importantly, when s <dig> was used as a probe, there was an approximately 50% reduction in the formation of complex b than on r <dig>  this could be a consequence of an increase in sequence divergence  in this region between the two strains.

specificity of interaction of nuclear proteins with various probes from r and s strains was evaluated by competition assays in the presence of corresponding specific cold probe. the binding of nuclear factors to  <dig> bp upstream sequence from r strain  was highly specific as the formation of complexes a and b was reduced to 25% in presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled  <dig> bp cold probe in the emsa binding reaction mixture . competition experiments with sequentially shorter fragments from r and s strains also generated similar results showing the specificity of binding of nuclear factors to all the probes .

we also performed emsa experiments using nuclear extract from both the strains to evaluate the presence of additional transcription factors in the r strain that could be absent in the s strain. noticeably, the binding pattern of nuclear proteins from s strain to s <dig> and r <dig> probes  were different from that of nuclear proteins from r strain. a similar result was obtained with s <dig> and r <dig> probes . when a nuclear extract from the s strain was used with r <dig> probe, the faster migrating band, complex b did not form. this is indicative of either a lack of the transcription binding factors in the s strain that form complex b or their low concentrations that prevent detection. the association of putative binding factors was quantified by converting intensity of signals to numerical values by using the image analysis software, imagequant tl  and the results were presented as bars in figures,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

discussion
naturally occurring, malaria-resistant strains, like the refractory strain of anopheles culicifacies are very rare in the field. low occurrence of such resistant phenotype is attributed to the selection pressures on the immune system that are responsible for strain survival and reproductive success. genetic analyses of this strain have revealed that the genes for refractoriness in a. culicifacies are dominant and autosomal  <cit> . here, we present analyses of one of the putative biochemical factors of natural population of a. culicifacies mosquito that displays refractoriness to plasmodium by melanotic encapsulation of ookinetes. the phenoloxidase cascade that is responsible for the melanization event recruits serine protease to activate prophenoloxidase, thereby leading to the formation of phenoloxidase, tyrosine and quinones  <cit> . serine proteases are reported to play a determinant role in triggering melanotic encapsulation of parasites in many malaria-refractory mosquito strains  <cit> .

we focused our analysis on one of the early determinants of encapsulation phenotype, serine proteases. a parasite-inducible serine protease-encoding gene  was isolated from the body tissue of a. culicifacies. the deduced protein, acsp <dig>  shared 30% or less sequence similarity with serine proteases from other insects such as drosophila, chrysomia and culex. these serine proteases are reported to function mainly in dissolution of fibrin clots or in embryonic development. notably, acsp <dig> did not possess a clip domain and shared a very low sequence homology  with clip domain serine proteases that are implicated in melanization of malaria parasites  <cit> . it may represent a divergent class of hitherto undescribed serine protease that plays a role in melanotic encapsulation of the parasite.

importantly, transcriptional analysis of acsp <dig> revealed that it could play an important role in the mosquito immunity. real time analysis demonstrated that the levels of acsp <dig> were 40-fold higher in the refractory strain as compared to the susceptible strain even in the absence of any challenge. the strain seems to have evolved the capacity to constitutively express high levels of serine protease, which could serve as a molecular marker for differentiating r and s strains. the high transcript levels of acsp <dig> in the r strain prompted us to further investigate its role inresponse to parasite invasion. in this regard, time-dependent experiments that involved feeding r and s mosquitoes uninfected and plasmodium-infected blood were carried out. expression levels of acsp <dig> were significantly increased upon un-infected blood feeding  in the r strain but no such induction was observed in the s strain, thereby making it a strain-specific response. upon feeding parasite-infected blood, the transcription of acsp <dig> was further upregulated  suggesting that endogenous levels of the transcript were not sufficient to combat the invading parasite and an added induction was required to block parasite development. noticeably, upregulation of acsp <dig> transcript levels  <dig> hours after parasite-infected blood feeding coincided well with the appearance of melanotically encapsulated ookinetes in midgut of the r strain of a. culicifacies.

both, time and high level of induction of acsp <dig> are suggestive of its role in ppo-mediated melanization cascade triggered in response to plasmodium. importantly, the transcript levels of acsp <dig> were unaffected when the non-melanizing s strain was fed on plasmodium-infected blood . this result further strengthened the possibility of involvement of acsp <dig> in contributing towards the refractory phenotype to the mosquito along with other genes. interestingly, when the r strain of a. culicifacies was challenged with a gram-positive bacterium, micrococcus luteus , the expression levels of acsp <dig> were not affected, indicating that the induction of acsp <dig> was a plasmodium-specific response.

recently, gene silencing of clip domain serine proteases by rnai have revealed their involvement in killing of parasite and melanization of sephadex beads  <cit> . the loss of refractory phenotype of the r strain mosquitoes upon injection of dsrna corresponding to acsp <dig> could illuminate the specific role of acsp <dig> in melanization. the steps that lead from upregulation of acsp <dig> to encapsulation in the refractory strain are not clear at present. it is possible that upregulation may be a postmelanotic event facilitating clearance of parasite  <cit> .

to understand the basis of differential expression of acsp <dig> in the r and s strains, structural analysis of the gene was carried out. genomic dna and cdna sequences of acsp <dig> from both strains were found to be identical, including the presence of a  <dig> bp intron. therefore, we concluded that the coding and the non-coding regions of the gene were not responsible for the observed differential expression in the two strains. the upstream sequences of the gene from both the strains were cloned, scanned and evaluated for promoter activity using a promoterless, luciferase reporter vector. the promoter activity of the  <dig> bp regions was nearly identical whereas  <dig> bp region from the r strain yielded  <dig> -fold higher luciferase activity than the s strain. this observation suggested that the sequence between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp was responsible for the differences in promoter activity in r and s strains. sequence alignment of the  <dig> bp region  from both strains revealed 54% similarity compared to 94% similarity in the  <dig> bp region  thereby providing support to above observation.

an in silico analysis of acsp <dig> upstream sequences was carried out using the matinspector program. it is premature to identify amongst the listed transcription factors any correlative specifics for encapsulation, nevertheless, one particular transcription factor that deserves special mention is dorsal. it is mainly engaged in transcriptional activation of genes involved in dorsoventral patterning  <cit> . the mosquito orthologue of dorsal is gambifl , which has been shown to translocate to the nucleus following bacterial but not plasmodium infection  <cit> . interestingly, this site was present in the upstream sequences of acsp <dig> from susceptible but not from the refractory strain.

several signature sequence motifs implicated in promoters of immune-responsive genes from a. gambiae and aedes aegypti  <cit>  were also present within the upstream sequences of acsp <dig>  notably, the consensus for nf-κb, which is reported in aedes  <cit>  and a. gambiae  <cit>  defensin genes is absent in acsp <dig>  suggesting that defensin pathway-associated serine protease is different from the phenoloxidase-associated serine protease. interestingly, the a. gambiae ppo <dig> gene that codes for melanin-synthesizing enzyme prophenoloxidase is the first mosquito immune gene reported to contain two ecdysteroid response elements  in its promoter sequence  <cit> . using reported consensus sequences, two putative ecres were located in acsp <dig> upstream sequences from the r strain and one in the s strain  <cit> . the significance of these differences and their eventual effect on refractoriness in a. culicifacies remains to be ascertained. a closer look at the nucleotide composition of the upstream sequences in the two strains revealed a very high g+c content in the r sequences and high a+t in the s sequences which probably could influence the affinities or the strength of the dna-protein interactions.

emsa experiments were carried out to further characterize the upstream sequences of acsp <dig> from both strains. together with  <dig> bp, which showed higher promoter activity in r strain, two more regions within  were chosen for emsa experiments. nuclear proteins from the r strain mosquitoes interacted with r <dig> probe to form two complexes, larger complex a and smaller complex b. the complex a appeared as a discrete band whereas complex b was observed as a diffused band in the agarose gel with greater intensity than complex a. this could be due to greater affinity of complex b for the probe than complex a or due to its higher abundance. the sequence differences between r <dig> and s <dig> led to a 25% reduction in formation of both the complexes on s <dig>  showing an overall decrease in number of transcription factors binding the upstream sequences of acsp <dig> in the s strain as compared to the r strain. competition binding experiments demonstrated that binding of nuclear proteins for complex formation was highly specific. by using two deletion mutants of the  <dig> bp region, we were able to narrow down the regions that were important for the assembly of both complexes.

the formation of complex a was seen even in the smallest,  <dig> bp region used for emsa experiments but complex b was completely abolished in this region and required an additional  <dig> bases. importantly, s strain nuclear extracts lacked or had very low levels of transcription binding factors  forming complex b. complex a formation remained unaffected on using nuclear extract from the s strain, indicating that the nuclear proteins forming complex a were present in both the strains but, the sequence difference between r and s upstream sequences was critical for its formation. on the other hand, formation of complex b was sensitive to both the sequence and the presence of transcription binding factors in the nuclear extract. identification and characterization of these tbfs would be necessary to further evaluate the differences in the two strains. the 2-d analysis of nuclear proteins from s and r strains will probably reveal the identity of the tbfs responsible for high level expression of acsp <dig> transcript and other genes contributing to the refractory phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this is the first report of an immune-responsive serine protease from a field-collected refractory strain of anopheles culicifacies, the main vector of malaria in india. transcript abundance of acsp <dig> in naïve adult refractory mosquitoes, even in the absence of any immune challenge, suggests possibility of its contribution towards refractory phenotype to a. culicifacies population. through a series of emsa experiments and in silico analysis, we have tentatively identified potential regulatory binding motifs that could be responsible for differential expression of acsp <dig> in r and s strains of a. culicifacies. further analysis of factors responsible for conferring refractory phenotype to mosquito against malaria parasite may pave way towards identification of critical intervening steps to abort parasite development in mosquito.
