BACKGROUND
nucleoplasmin was initially isolated from african clawed frog  egg extracts and it was described as an acidic chaperone protein capable of assembling nucleosomes  <cit> . indeed, it represents the "archetypal" molecular chaperone  <cit>  and is certainly the first of a long list of chromatin assembly complexes that have been, and still are, the focus of much research attention  <cit> . in the egg, nucleoplasmin is found natively bound to histones h2a and h2b, facilitating the storage of these proteins  <cit> .

nucleoplasmin is the most abundant protein in xenopus oocytes. it is a highly thermostable protein and is very rich in acidic amino acids . it consists of approximately  <dig> amino acids and exists as a pentamer  <cit> . the first  <dig> n-terminal amino acids contain a small acidic cluster and exhibit a highly organized secondary and tertiary structure and constitute the "core" of the protein that is responsible for the formation of the pentameric structure of the molecule. by contrast, the last  <dig> c-terminal amino acids are sensitive to protease digestion, highly unstructured, and hence correspond to the "tails" of the protein. these regions contain two polyglutamic clusters, one of which spans  <dig> amino acids, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal  <cit> .

in vivo, nucleoplasmin has been shown to mediate the x. laevis sperm decondensation in the egg cytoplasm that takes place immediately after fertilization  <cit> . this process involves the binding of the x. laevis snbps and transfer of h2a-h2b to the sperm chromatin  <cit> . the protein exchange is enhanced by the dramatic increase in phosphorylation undergone by the protein  <cit>   during the maturation of the oocyte into the unfertilized egg  <cit> . high levels of phosphorylation remain until the mid-blastula transition , following which the levels drop off  <cit> .

snbps can be classified in three major groups  according to their compositional and structural organization  <cit> . the histone type h consists, as its name indicates, of proteins which are very similar to the histones that are found associated with dna in somatic chromatin complexes  <cit> . the protamine type p includes a group of highly specialized arginine-rich sperm chromosomal proteins of relatively small molecular mass   <cit> . the protamine-like type encompasses a highly structurally heterogeneous group of proteins with intermediate composition between protamines and histones  which are evolutionarily related to histone h <dig>  <cit> .

the snbps of x. laevis consist of a structurally heterogeneous mixture of protamine-like proteins named sp1-sp <dig> that coexist with an h2a-h2b deficient complement of histones h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> . it is important to mention though, that this composition varies significantly between different species of xenopus which in some instances only contain sp1- <dig>  and more often than not contain a stoichiometric complement of nucleosomal h2a-h2b and h3-h <dig>  <cit> .

in contrast to the sp1-sp <dig> proteins from x. laevis that have an amino acid composition intermediate between histones and protamines and hence belong to the pl type  <cit> , the toad bufo contains protamines in its sperm that are very rich in arginine and can be considered representatives of the vertebrate p type snbp  <cit> . in the frog rana, the mature sperm contains histones that are almost indistinguishable from the somatic counterparts as is characteristic of the h type  <cit> .

if nucleoplasmin is involved in sperm chromatin remodeling during fertilization  <cit> , the existence of three main types of structurally and compositionally different snbp raises the question of whether there are three different nucleoplasmins specific for each of these types or whether, in contrast to snbps, nucleoplasmin is a highly conserved molecule. amphibians provide a unique opportunity to address this question as the group contains representative organisms of each of the main snbp types.

in this paper we have characterized the structure of the xenopus nucleoplasmin gene as well as the complete sequences of both the bufo marinus and rana catesbeiana nucleoplasmin cdnas. the analysis of these sequences shows that nucleoplasmin is indeed a highly conserved protein that is closely related to mammalian npm <dig>  and suggests that its functional role goes beyond chromatin assembly immediately after fertilization, into the early stages of development. we propose that nucleoplasmin may have acquired the function of snbp removal after fertilization in many vertebrates because of the appearance and vertical evolution of snbps.

RESULTS
ubiquitous presence of nucleoplasmin in the eggs of amphibians
as it can be seen in figure 1aâ€“c, r. catesbeiana sperm contains only core histones that, except for the histone h <dig> counterpart, exhibited identical electrophoretic mobility to those of somatic histones . indeed, the sperm of this amphibian has been shown to consist of core histones that have amino acid compositions identical to those of somatic tissues and a set of highly specific linker histones with similar composition to histone h <dig>  <cit> .

in contrast to r. catesbeiana, the snbps of x. laevis in testis showed the presence of a complex mixture of snbps of the pl type   <cit>  , which in the mature sperm coexist with a h3-h <dig> complement. alternatively, b. marinus contained a typical vertebrate protamine  <cit>  . thus, the protein composition of the sperm chromatin of these organisms is very different.

with the exception of x. laevis nucleoplasmin, which has been extensively characterized and has been for many years used as a generic prototype for nucleoplasmin, only fractional information is available on bufo nucleoplasmin  <cit>  and very little is known about its existence in rana  <cit> . therefore, we took advantage of an antibody developed in our lab against recombinant x. laevis nucleoplasmin to identify the nucleoplasmin-like proteins in egg extracts of these two organisms. the candidate bands from gels were then used to obtain some partial protein sequence information in order to further confirm the bands identity and to produce primers that would allow us to obtain the complete cdna sequences of these proteins.

one of the distinctive features of nucleoplasmin is its ability to retain its native pentameric conformation  in the presence of the sds used in the sample buffer of sds-page  <cit> . the monomeric subunit can only be visualized after extensive  boiling in the presence of the sds  sample buffer. we exploited this highly characteristic property in order to analyze the egg extracts from x. laevis, b. marinus and r. catesbeiana. figure  <dig> shows the results of unboiled  and boiled  extracts separated by sds-page . the presence of nucleoplasmin was assessed by western blot analysis using an antibody against x. laevis recombinant nucleoplasmin   <cit> . for all three extracts a higher molecular weight form corresponding to the pentamer was seen in the unboiled samples  which dissociated into monomers following boiling in sds sample buffer . note that x. laevis and b. marinus exhibited a smeared band in the region of the sds-page corresponding to the pentameric form, a fact that can be attributed to either differences in the extent of phosphorylation or the incorrect folding of the pentamer. in addition, due to its highly charged nature , nucleoplasmin is known to have aberrant migration on sds-page gels.

although the presence of nucleoplasmin in bufo had already been well documented  <cit> , the presence of a nucleoplasmin-like equivalent protein in rana had never been demonstrated, despite the fact it was known that rana egg extracts had the ability to decondense demembranated sperm nuclei from xenopus  <cit> . the results of figure  <dig> encouraged us to pursue the isolation of such a protein and also to determine the hitherto unknown primary structure of bufo nucleoplasmin. to this end, nuclear extracts were purified as described in the experimental section and the extent of purity of the fractions was monitored by sds-page western analysis. bands for the b. marinus and r. catesbeiana nucleoplasmins, such as those shown in figure  <dig>  were excised and analyzed by mass spectroscopy to obtain partial protein sequence information. this information, together with the nucleotide sequence available from the genome draft of x. tropicalis for the nucleoplasmin gene , was used to generate primers to be used in conjunction with mrna prepared from both r. catesbeiana and b. marinus egg extracts.

the amphibian nucleoplasmin gene contains multiple exons and encodes highly conserved proteins
as it has been mentioned in the previous section, the current availability of the x. tropicalis genome draft has proven to be very useful in achieving some of the objectives pursued in this work. figure 3a shows the coding region corresponding to the nucleoplasmin gene of x. tropicalis  and the corresponding organization of the gene, which contains of  <dig> introns, is shown in figure 3b. a very similar organization was found in the case of the x. laevis nucleoplasmin gene when it was analyzed using the genomic dna of this species and primers designed based on the cdna sequence .

we also established the complete cdna sequences for one of the nucleoplasmin genes from each b. marinus  and r. catesbeiana  which were submitted to genebank december,  <dig> . the precise number of nucleoplasmin genes in each genome has not yet been determined. however, two different cdnas have been isolated from x. laevis that encode for two almost identical forms of the protein, except for the fact that one of them is  <dig> amino acids shorter  <cit>  than the other  <cit> . it is thus possible that at least one other cdna sequence besides those shown in figure  <dig> is present in each of these species. nevertheless, mass spectroscopic determination of the nucleoplasmin proteins purified by us from the egg extracts, confirmed that the proteins encoded by the cdnas shown in figure  <dig> correspond to the main translated mrna forms .

the comparison of the amino acid sequences for the different amphibian nucleoplasmin proteins is shown in figure  <dig>  as it can be seen, the protein sequence is extremely conserved  among the different amphibian species analyzed. hence, it is to be expected that these proteins all have a common closely related function across these species.

amphibian nucleoplasmin is closely related to mammalian npm2
it is possible to use the sequence information shown in figure  <dig> in the context of all the nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin metazoan sequences to determine the phylogenetic relationships of their main families: npm <dig>  npm <dig>  and npm <dig> . npm <dig> includes a set of nucleoplasmin-like proteins, also referred to as nucleophosmin, which localize to the nucleolus of somatic cells and have been implicated numerous cellular processes including ribosome biogenesis  <cit> , centrosome duplication  <cit>  and nuclear chaperoning  <cit> . npm <dig> variants have an important role in embryonic development and mutations of the genes encoding these proteins have been shown to be involved in acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> . npm <dig> and npm <dig> are nuclear chaperone proteins. the latter is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues  <cit>  in contrast to npm <dig> which is only found in oocytes and eggs  <cit> . mammalian npm <dig> has been shown to play a critical role in nucleolar and nuclear organization and plays an important role in the maintenance of the perinuclear heterochromatin which is usually observed in eggs and early embryos  <cit> . although npm <dig> antisense oligonucleotides injected into mammalian oocytes significantly prevented histone assembly and male pronuclear formation  <cit> , the molecular components involved in the sperm chromatin remodeling after fertilization in mammals still remains largely unknown.

as shown by figure  <dig> and not surprisingly, the four amphibian sequences cluster together in this analysis. they are in turn grouped with npm <dig> opposed to family members in npm <dig> and npm <dig> or the insect nucleoplasmin-like proteins. although amphibian nucleoplasmins group with mammalian npm <dig> relative to other family members, they are in distinct clusters of the evolutionary analysis. in addition, broader evolutionary analyses  reveal a polyphyletic origin for the npm <dig> lineage, which maybe due to the differentiation between amphibians  and mammals .

r. catesbeiana nucleoplasmin is mainly expressed in oocytes
in order to put the phylogenetic implications into a functional perspective, we made rna extracts from different tissues of r. catesbeiana and the levels of expression of nucleoplasmin and nucleophosmin were assessed using dot blot northern hybridization . of the three genera of amphibians studied here, we chose rana for this analysis because we reasoned that the presence of canonical histones in the mature sperm of this organism makes it unlikely that the major function of nucleoplasmin is that of remodeling of the male pronucleus chromatin.

the results obtained are similar to those obtained with other vertebrate species. as expected from its generic participation in ribosome biogenesis, nucleophosmin was widely distributed throughout the different tissues analyzed  with different levels of expression which likely reflect their ribosome assembly nucleolar activity. in contrast, nucleoplasmin  mrna appeared to be primarily transcribed in the egg, a result which is consistent with the results reported for other species  <cit> . although some background is observed in the lane of dots corresponding to the nucleoplasmin tissue distribution, this appears to follow the same pattern of distribution observed for nucleophosmin and it is likely the result of the some cross hybridization of the nucleoplasmin and nucleophosmin probes.

thus, like mammalian nucleoplasmin, amphibian npm <dig> is predominantly expressed in the oocyte nuclei were it likely accumulates and persists throughout the first stages of early development  <cit> . in the case of mammals, npm <dig> participates in different roles from nucleolar organization to chromatin remodeling  <cit> .

discussion
in the introduction we put forward a question regarding the specificity of nucleoplasmin within the functional context of its participation in the remodeling of sperm chromatin with different types of snbps .

the results described in the previous section show that within amphibians, nucleoplasmin is a highly conserved protein  in contrast to the structural and compositional heterogeneity of the snbps . this suggests that the removal of snbps is a highly non-specific process, a notion that is further reinforced by the observation that nucleoplasmin binds equally well to protamines  <cit> , protamine-like proteins  <cit>  and somatic linker histones  <cit> in vitro. the non-specificity of the sperm chromatin remodeling process  is also supported by the observations that different egg extracts appear to be interchangeable in terms of their ability to decondense sperm chromatin <cit> . in addition, the normal progression of sperm dna decondensation in npm2-null embryos in mice suggests that other related proteins  may even be able to compensate in this process  <cit> . it is possible that the polyglutamic tracts of nucleoplasmin in conjunction with phosphorylation play a critical role in out-competing the electrostatic interaction between the highly positively charged snbps and dna in sperm chromatin  <cit> .

the lack of specificity with which nucleoplasmin removes snbps during the formation of the male pronuclei  contrasts with the specificity implicit in the binding of h2a and h2b histones during the early stages of development of the zygote. while the molecule has a conserved binding site highly specific for histones  <cit> , which is most likely stereo-specific  <cit>  and involves the highly structured n-terminal part of the molecule  <cit> , the binding of snbps is quite non-specific and it probably involves the glutamic acid rich domains that become overexposed when the molecule becomes phosphorylated during oocyte maturation  <cit> . indeed, nucleoplasmin is found associated with h2a-h2b in the egg  <cit> , a property that originally led to the first time coining of the term molecular chaperone to describe this molecule  <cit> . our results suggest that in addition to x. laevis, whose sperm chromatin is deficient in h2a-h2b  <cit> , nucleoplasmin contributes the h2a-h2b dimers during the formation of the male pronuclei in other vertebrate organisms regardless of the initial snbp composition of the male chromatin during fertilization. other assembly factors such as n1/n <dig>  <cit>  and nap <dig>  <cit>  provide the h3-h <dig> and egg-specific linker histones  respectively. this process continues throughout the assembly of chromatin that takes place during the cell divisions preceding the mid blastula transition  <cit> . nucleoplasmin phosphorylation, which remains high until this stage, may facilitate the histone exchange between nucleoplasmin and the newly replicated chromatin and does not interfere with the h <dig> deposition that takes place downstream of the replication fork long after the nucleosomes have been assembled  <cit> .

finally, we have shown that nucleoplasmin shares a close phylogenetic relationship  and similar tissue distribution  to mammalian npm <dig>  <cit> . not only this, but the genes encoding for these two proteins exhibit a highly complex similar organization which in the case of the amphibian counterpart spans over eight translated exons . thus, it is highly possible that like mammalian npm <dig>  amphibian nucleoplasmin has some additional chromatin remodeling functions during these early stages of development. all these observations  also confirm that mammalian npm <dig> is the genuine mammalian equivalent of amphibian nucleoplasmin.

CONCLUSIONS
our results clearly show that nucleoplasmin is highly conserved between different amphibian species and its presence is independent of the snbp type. although amphibian nucleoplasmin clusters with mammalian npm <dig> in phylogenies, broader evolutionary analyses  reveal a polyphyletic origin for the npm <dig> lineage, which maybe due to the differentiation of snpbs between amphibians  and mammals . thus, while histone storage and exchange in early development represents a critical function of nucleoplasmin, the appearance of snbps of the h-type early in metazoan evolution, as well as their subsequent differentiation towards pl and p-types, could have been a strong enough functional constraint to recruit snbp removal as an acquired non-specific function. this additional role became critical in animals as the vertical evolution of snbps progressively led to the incorporation of more specialized pl and p proteins in sperm chromatin.

in closing, nucleoplasmin can be defined as a non-specific atp-independent sperm chromatin remodeller with a highly specific chromatin assembly activity that plays a critical role in chromatin metabolism during the early stages of development.
