BACKGROUND
pathogenesis is the series of events that occurs in a host-pathogen interaction, including infection and colonization of the host, and reproduction and dissemination of the pathogen. genetic variation in host and/or pathogen can have quantitative or qualitative effects on the extent of disease. many plant genetic factors that modulate pathogenesis have been discovered. the best known group is the r-genes, which provide high levels of resistance or even complete immunity. r-gene mediated resistance is initiated through a gene-for-gene interaction; the recognition of a pathogen effector by a host protein encoded by the r-gene leads to the induction of the hypersensitive response , the production of antimicrobial metabolites such as phytoalexins, and the expression of pathogenesis-related  proteins  <cit> . this type of interaction, typically resulting in a highly effective but race-specific defense response against pathogenic invasion, is sometimes known as qualitative resistance. quantitative resistance, on the other hand, confers intermediate levels of resistance and is believed to be controlled by a set of genes distinct from, or partially overlapping with, those involved in qualitative resistance  <cit> .

although each quantitative resistance locus conditions a relatively small effect on pathogenesis, this type of resistance is of agricultural interest because qualitative resistance tends to be ephemeral in many pathosystems and is unavailable in others. quantitative resistance is presumably more durable because multiple genes with minor effects lead to lower selection pressure and greater complexity to overcome  <cit> . a large number of quantitative trait loci  for disease resistance have been mapped in plants  <cit> , but little is known about the underlying genetic basis or defense mechanisms involved. a range of genetic mechanisms controlling basal resistance, defense signalling pathways, detoxification, morphology, and development in the plant host, is hypothesized to be associated with reducing disease progress  <cit> . a small number of quantitative resistance genes have recently been cloned  <cit> , implicating diverse host functions in quantitative resistance.

given that diverse host functions affect quantitative resistance, it is likely that qtl act at different stages of pathogenesis. the ways in which quantitative resistance affects different stages of pathogenesis has been addressed, to a limited extent, by comparing trait values obtained using distinct  disease components. in most  of the phytopathosystems analyzed to date, differences in various disease parameters can be observed among plant genotypes. previous qtl studies for foliar diseases have mapped distinct loci associated with incubation period, lesion number, lesion size, or diseased leaf area, with results suggesting that defense genes affecting lesion formation and lesion expansion may not be the same. in breeding programs, selection for decreased lesion length or lesion numbers can have insignificant effects on incubation period or disease severity . these observations suggest that distinct resistance mechanisms govern different macroscopic components of resistance.

more insights into the role of a given disease qtl in limiting pathogenesis can be gained through histopathological analysis. while biochemical and microscopic analyses have been applied to investigate major gene resistance and fungal pathogenicity factors , few studies have reported the effect of individual qtl on distinct stages of pathogenesis from a microscopic view . if qtl effective at specific stages of pathogenesis can be identified, combining favorable alleles for complementary qtl  will likely provide greater levels of resistance.

northern leaf blight  of maize was used as a model system to identify and characterize disease qtl at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. nlb, caused by setosphaeria turcica , is one of the most prevalent foliar diseases in most maize-growing regions of the world. the disease causes periodic epidemics associated with significant yield losses  <cit> , particularly under conditions of moderate temperature and high humidity  <cit> . qualitative and quantitative forms of resistance against s. turcica are available in maize germplasm  <cit> , and have been widely utilized alone or in combination in resistance breeding programs  <cit> . a few histological studies have revealed the pathogenesis of s. turcica on maize leaves by staining, whole mount and serial dissection  <cit> . marked phenotypic variation in symptom development has been observed among diverse maize lines in our multiple field and greenhouse trials. how macroscopic and microscopic phenotypes relate to specific qtl remains to be determined.

to answer questions concerning individual qtl effects, such as testing the hypothesis that distinct qtl act at different stages of pathogenesis, well-defined genetic stocks that differ only at specific loci are required. introgression lines have been successfully used to study qtl in maize  <cit> , rice  <cit> , barley  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and arabidopsis  <cit> . while qtl analysis using recombinant inbred lines  provides greater statistical power in detecting qtl  <cit> , ril-based approaches have limitations in estimating qtl effects  <cit> . introgression lines can be efficiently used to produce near-isogenic lines , which permit careful analysis of phenotypic effects associated with introgressed segments  <cit> .

nils allow many long-standing questions about quantitative disease resistance to be addressed, such as the relationship between disease qtl and plant maturity, the interaction of qtl and environmental factors, and the specificity of resistance conditioned by qtl. the interplay between disease resistance and plant development has been widely recognized  <cit>  yet remains poorly understood. in general, the resistance in adult plants or older leaves is greater than in juvenile plants or younger leaves , and a correlation between resistance and flowering time has been found . some qtl effects may thus be specific to certain plant developmental stages. in addition, the expression and effectiveness of many genes/qtl have been observed to be regulated by environmental conditions  <cit> . another issue of fundamental and practical interest is whether a disease qtl confers specific or broad-spectrum resistance. a single locus can condition resistance to more than one disease, if it encompasses linked qtl effective against different diseases, or its underlying genes are involved in broad-spectrum resistance pathways.

here, we describe the use of introgression lines and derived nils for qtl mapping and macro-/microscopic characterization in the maize - s. turcica pathosystem. we used an available population of introgression lines named tbbc <dig>  <cit> . this population is composed of introgression lines, each of which carries one or a few chromosomal segments of the donor genotype tx <dig> in the genetic background of the recurrent parent b <dig>  to better understand the nature of quantitative resistance, we assembled a panel of conventional and novel disease components targeting different stages of disease development. these were used to demonstrate that two qtl affect different stages of pathogenesis. the qtl were further characterized to shed light on three secondary hypotheses:  that disease qtl differ by host developmental stage ;  that their performance changes across environments ; and  that they condition broad-spectrum resistance. this approach to identifying and dissecting quantitative resistance in plants will facilitate more effective and efficient application of quantitative resistance in crop protection.

methods
plant materials
a set of  <dig> tbbc <dig> introgression lines was provided by j. holland of the usda-ars unit at north carolina state university. the tbbc <dig>  population, originally developed by c. stuber at north carolina state university  <cit> , was the most extensively developed set of introgression lines available at the time for public use in maize. the population was derived from an initial cross of tx <dig> and b <dig>  followed by backcrossing to b <dig> for three generations. each line was then selfed for several generations to attain homozygosity. genotypic information was publicly available for each line, consisting of  <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism  and  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers across the genome. each line was known to carry one or more tx <dig> introgressions, covering on average  <dig> % of the genome, in the background of the sequenced reference maize line b <dig>  taken together, the set of introgression lines collectively carries ~89% of tx <dig> genome  <cit> .

to validate and characterize the effects of tx <dig> introgressions, several bc4f <dig> populations were developed by crossing selected tbbc <dig> lines to b <dig>  sets of bc4f <dig> and bc4f <dig> lines carrying different introgression were subsequently derived by single-seed descent. after four generations of marker-assisted backcrossing, the bc4f <dig> and bc4f <dig> lines were designated as nils.

assessments of northern leaf blight
a single isolate of s. turcica  was used in the experiments carried out in new york , and a mixture of isolates representing race  <dig>  race  <dig>  and race 23n of s. turcica was used in north carolina . for preparation of liquid inoculum, s. turcica was cultured for two to three weeks on lactose - casein hydrolysate agar  plates under a  <dig> hr/ <dig> hr normal light-dark cycle at room temperature. the conidia were then dislodged with sterile ddh2o and a glass rod, filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, and adjusted to the final concentration with the aid of a haemocytometer. solid inoculum was prepared by culturing s. turcica on sorghum grains in plastic milk jugs for two to three weeks under the same condition. for each jug,  <dig> ml of sorghum grains were soaked overnight in  <dig> ml of water in a milk jug. the jug was then autoclaved twice at 121°c,  <dig> lb/cm <dig>  for  <dig> minutes per run. the jugs were inoculated by dividing the spore suspension produced from one heavily colonized lca plate  among five jugs. jugs were shaken daily to prevent caking and accelerate fungal colonization.

in this study, the "juvenile" phase refers to earlier vegetative stages, and the "adult" phase refers to later vegetative stages and reproductive stages. juvenile plants  and adult plants  were used for inoculation. the inoculation technique utilized depended on the specific objectives of the experiment. in the field trials in ny, plants were inoculated with both liquid  and solid inoculum  placed in the whorl. this was done to ensure the viability of inoculum across a range of conditions . in the field trials in nc, ~ <dig> grains of sorghum colonized with s. turcica were placed in the whorl.

in greenhouse trials, whorl inoculation with aforementioned liquid inoculum was carried out for assessing individual plants in the segregating populations. spray inoculation was performed for detailed qtl characterization using nils, as it provides significantly better differentiation for nlb evaluation . the spray method was preferred for microscopic examination and real-time pcr quantification. a higher number of spores could be evenly distributed on leaf surface with spraying, making the subsequent sampling more effective and accurate. about  <dig>  ml of concentrated spore suspension  was evenly sprayed on the first fully expanded leaf with an airbrush  at  <dig> psi. after inoculation, the plants were kept overnight in a mist chamber at > 85% rh, then maintained at 22°c day/18°c night temperature with a  <dig> hr-light/ <dig> hr-dark cycle.

phenotypic characterization of resistance to nlb
field experiments were conducted at cornell's robert musgrave research farm in aurora, ny and central crops field station in clayton, nc. plants were evaluated for different disease parameters and for days to anthesis . dta, which was only assessed for field-grown plants, was scored on a row basis when > 50% of the plants in a row started to shed pollen. an overview of various disease components used in this study and their corresponding stages during nlb development is summarized in table  <dig>  the evaluation method for each parameter is illustrated as below.

microscopic analysis
two microscopy techniques were applied to investigate differential development of s. turcica in the nils: trypan blue staining and koh-aniline blue staining. in greenhouse trials, infected leaf samples were harvested from individual plants. in the field trial, for the purpose of obtaining a sufficient number of infection sites for examination, samples  were collected from four plants in a row and pooled for subsequent treatments.

trypan blue staining was performed as previously described  <cit>  with some modifications. infected tissues were collected at two days post inoculation  from plants in the greenhouse, and at  <dig> dpi from plants in the field trials. leaf samples were cut into  <dig> ×  <dig> cm <dig> segments, cleared first in an acetic acid: ethanol  solution overnight, then in an acetic acid: ethanol: glycerol  solution for at least  <dig> hours. the samples were subsequently incubated overnight in a staining solution of  <dig> %  trypan blue in lactophenol, and rinsed then stored in 60% glycerol until examination. specimens were transferred onto microscopic slides and examined under a compound microscope. fifty to  <dig> germinated conidia were assessed per individual plant  or per row .

a modified koh-aniline blue fluorescence technique  <cit>  was used to visualize the growth of fungal hyphae inside the infected leaves and the accumulation of  callose and phenotypic compounds around the infection sites. infected leaves were sampled at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi in greenhouse trials, and at  <dig> dpi in the field trial. the samples were cut into  <dig> ×  <dig> cm <dig> segments, incubated in  <dig> m koh at room temperature for  <dig> hours, then autoclaved at 121°c,  <dig> lb/cm <dig> for 2- <dig> min. autoclaving time was adjusted according to the rigidity of leaves, which varied with plant genotype and maturity. the autoclaved specimens were rinsed in ddh2o three times, then stored in autoclaved ddh2o until examination. specimens were carefully placed on microscopic slides and mounted in a staining solution of  <dig> % aniline blue in  <dig>  m k2hpo <dig> . thirty five to  <dig> germinated conidia were checked per individual plant  or per row  under a zeiss fluorescence microscope with a g <dig> excitation filter, a ft <dig> dichromatic beam splitter, and an lp <dig> barrier filter.

quantitative real-time pcr for quantifying fungal colonization
dna-based quantitative pcr  was performed as described by qi and yang  <cit>  with some modifications. the specific pair of primers for s. turcica: forward: 5'-tcttttgcgcacttgttgtt and reverse: 5'-cgatgccagaaccaagagat, was designed based on the internal transcribed spacer  <dig>  of ribosomal dna gene in s. turcica. the its <dig> sequence  was obtained from the nucleotide database of the national center for biotechnology information . pcr amplification resulted in a specific fragment of  <dig> base pairs.

inoculation experiments were performed three times in the greenhouse. five plants per genotype were spray-inoculated. the same amounts of infected tissue  were collected at  <dig> dpi from the middle part of each leaf. leaf samples were ground with liquid nitrogen and dna was extracted following the protocol described later. the extracted dna from each individual plant was dissolved in  <dig> μl te buffer. total dna concentration was determined using the picogreen® dsdna quantitation assay kit . fungal dna was quantified using qpcr. the ratio of fungal biomass in maize leaves was computed from the amount of fungal dna divided by total dna.

each qpcr reaction was performed in a total volume of  <dig> μl, containing  <dig>  μl of itaq sybr® green supermix with rox ,  <dig> μl of  <dig> -fold diluted dna from an infected plant and  <dig> nm of each forward and reverse primer. pcr samples were incubated in an abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system  with thermal cycling parameters of 95°c for  <dig> min followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> sec at 95°c and  <dig> sec at 56°c. two standard curves were constructed by mixing a series of s. turcica dna  with  <dig> ng of maize dna extracted from non-inoculated b <dig> and tx <dig> plants, respectively. the quantification of fungal biomass in infected b <dig> and derived nils was based on the first standard curve , while the quantification for dna from infected tx <dig> was based on the second standard curve. three technical replicates were carried out in individual plates for both picogreen quantification and itaq sybr green pcr, with the samples for standard curves repeated twice in the same plates.

incubation period 
individual plants were checked every day after  <dig> dpi for the appearance of the first wilted lesions. the number of dpi when the first lesions were observed was scored as the ip. in the trials at aurora ny, ip scores were rated for individual plants, then averaged for the rows. in the trial at clayton nc, ip was recorded on a row basis when > 50% of the plants in a row started showing lesions.

lesion expansion 
le was scored in the trials in ny but not nc. around two to three weeks after inoculation, three lesions per plant were randomly chosen for measurement. lesion margins were marked and then measured 10- <dig> days later for the longitudinal extension with a digital caliper. the expansion measurements taken from three lesions were averaged, and divided by the number of days from the marking until measurement of the lesions.

primary diseased leaf area 
primary dla was rated as the percentage of infected leaf area of the inoculated leaves in the  <dig> trial in ny. it was scored once on a row basis at around three to four weeks after inoculation.

diseased leaf area 
dla was rated as the percentage of infected leaf area of the entire plant, disregarding decayed bottom leaves. dla was rated on a row basis for tbbc <dig> lines and derived nils, and on individual plants for testing trait-marker association in segregating populations. dla was rated three to four times per season at 10- <dig> day intervals. the first dla score was recorded at one to two weeks after observing the onset of secondary infection.

disease severity
disease severity was rated on a row basis four times through the season in the  <dig> trial in nc. the severity score was based on a  <dig> to  <dig> scale corresponding to the percentage of infected leaf area on primarily the ear leaf as well as the leaves above and below the ear leaf .

area under the disease progress curve 
the audpc was calculated as , where yi = dla or disease severity at time i, ti+ <dig> - ti = day interval between two ratings, n = number of ratings  <cit> .

evaluation for multiple disease resistance
stewart's wilt
pantoea stewartii  strain psny <dig>  originally collected in ny in  <dig>  was obtained from helene dillard of cornell university. inoculum was prepared as previously described  <cit>  with the use of nutrient agar plates and nutrient broth as media. plants at the five- to six-leaf stage were inoculated with p. stewartii following the pinprick method  <cit>  with a modified inoculator. the multiple-pin inoculator was made with  <dig> t-pins , pieces of  <dig>  cm ×  <dig>  cm sponge and cork board  fastened on two arms of a tong with rubber bands. primary diseased leaf area was rated as the percentage of infected area of the inoculated leaves. it was scored twice  on a row basis and the scores were averaged.

anthracnose stalk rot
a new york isolate of colletotrichum graminicola   was obtained from gary bergstrom of cornell university. each plant was inoculated with  <dig> ml of  <dig> conidia per ml  when more than 50% of the plants in every row were tasseling  <cit> . inoculum preparation and inoculation were conducted as described by muimba-kankolongo and bergstrom  <cit> , with the replacement of plastic straw with  <dig> ml pipette tips. four weeks after inoculation, stalks were split longitudinally and the percentages of discolored area of individual internodes were visually rated  <cit>  and summed for analysis. in  <dig>  eight consecutive internodes were scored from four plants per row ; in  <dig>  six consecutive internodes were scored from eight plants per row.

common smut
in the  <dig> trial, plants in nlb plots were evaluated for the development of ear galls and stalk galls resulting from natural infection. artificial inoculation was conducted in the  <dig> trial using six compatible strains of ustilago maydis , which were isolated from naturally infected smut galls collected at aurora ny in  <dig>  u. maydis strains were cultured as described by du toit and pataky  <cit> . inoculum was prepared by adjusting sporidial suspension  to a final concentration of  <dig> sporidia per ml  with sterilized distilled water. equal amounts of sporidia from the six compatible strains were mixed prior to inoculation. non-pollinated  primary ear of each plant was injected with  <dig> ml of mixed sporidial suspension at the time that the silks of most primary ears had emerged 1- <dig> cm. every plant in the row was rated from four weeks after inoculation for ear galls on a 0- <dig> scale, corresponding to the number and size of galls and the disease severity of the entire plant . stalk galls resulting from natural infection were also scored.

common rust
urediniospores of puccinia sorghi were collected from naturally infected leaves at aurora ny in  <dig>  inoculum was increased on three- to four-leaf stage seedlings of susceptible sweet corn in the greenhouse. about  <dig> mg of stock urediniospores  were suspended in  <dig> ml of sortrol oil   <cit>  and evenly applied on leaves with a spray gun . plants were kept overnight in a mist chamber at > 85% rh, then grown for two more weeks until puccinia sorghi sporulated vigorously. the urediniospores were collected by agitating infected leaves with mature rust pustules in distilled water and filtering through four layers of cheesecloth. spore suspension was adjusted to a final concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> urediniospores per ml with the aid of a haemocytometer. field plants were inoculated at the six- to eight-leaf stage by adding  <dig> ml of spore suspension  in the whorl  <cit> . evaluation for disease severity was based on a 0- <dig> scale with  <dig>  increments, corresponding to the percentage of infected leaf area of the entire plant . disease severity was scored three times at 9-day intervals from four weeks after inoculation in  <dig>  and at 15- <dig> day intervals from  <dig> days after inoculation in  <dig>  audpc was calculated from the three severity scores as described above.

dna extraction and genotyping
about  <dig>  g of fresh or lyophilized leaf tissue and a stainless steel ball  were loaded in each well of a 96-well plate . tissues were frozen at -80°c and pulverized at  <dig> strokes/min for 50- <dig> sec using genogrinder  <dig> . genomic dna was extracted following a standard ctab extraction protocol  <cit>  with  <dig> μl of ctab extraction buffer,  <dig> μl of chlorophorm/isoamyl alcohol , and  <dig> μl of isopropanol. fungal dna was extracted as described, except that s. turcica mycelium was ground in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar, and transferred to a  <dig>  ml eppendorf tube for later steps.

simple sequence repeat  markers were used for genotypic analysis following a single-reaction nested pcr method  <cit> . each pcr reaction was performed as described by wisser et al.  <cit>  in a total volume of  <dig> μl, with the same thermal cycling parameters as described by schuelke  <cit> . amplicons labeled with different fluorescent dyes were multiplexed , mixed with  <dig> μl formamide and  <dig> - <dig>  μl genescan- <dig> liz size standard , and analyzed on the applied biosystems 3730xl dna analyzer at biotechnology resource center at cornell university. the sizes of amplicons were scored using genemapper v.  <dig>  .

experimental design
the full set of  <dig> tbbc <dig> lines, a subset of  <dig> tbbc <dig> lines, and derived sets of bc4f <dig> and bc4f <dig> nils were evaluated in the field following the resolvable incomplete block design . the  <dig> tbbc <dig> lines were evaluated at aurora ny for ip, primdla, dla, and dta. to precisely estimate the effects of tx <dig> introgressions, every experimental row was grown next to a row of b <dig> . the whole design had two replicates with  <dig> blocks per replicate, and six experimental rows plus three b <dig> rows per block. a parallel experiment was conducted on the  <dig> tbbc <dig> lines at clayton nc with two replicates, nine blocks per replicate and  <dig> rows per block. the b <dig> rows were included in every other block for the control . disease severity and dta were evaluated. the field trials on the  <dig> selected tbbc <dig> lines were conducted at aurora ny and clayton nc following the alpha design with b <dig> in every third row as described above. the  <dig> lines were selected from those significantly different from b <dig> in nlb resistance , and/or from the lines carrying tx <dig> introgression corresponding to previously identified nlb qtl. in each location, there were four replicates with four blocks per replicate, and four experimental rows plus two b <dig> rows per block. the ip, dla, and dta were evaluated. an additional disease component, lesion expansion , was evaluated at aurora ny as well. during the same field season, to understand the effectiveness of identified qtl in adult plants, the same  <dig> selected tbbc <dig> lines were grown in a separate field plot at aurora ny, following identical arrangement and design with three replicates. the plants were inoculated two weeks before flowering , and evaluated for ip and dla.

to associate resistance with specific introgressions, several bc4f <dig> populations were genotyped and phenotyped for ip, le, and dla in either greenhouse or in the field at aurora ny. individual plants of each population were grown within a single block with b <dig> rows as the border. for qtl confirmation, derived bc4f <dig> and bc4f <dig> nils were evaluated at aurora ny for ip, le, dla, and dta, following the previously described alpha design with b <dig> rows in every third row. the experiment was planted in two replicates, with five blocks per replicate, and four experimental rows plus two b <dig> rows per block.

to test whether the identified nlb qtl confer resistance to other important maize diseases, derived bc4f <dig> and bc4f <dig> nils were evaluated at aurora ny for anthracnose stalk rot  and common smut in  <dig> and  <dig>  and for stewart's wilt and common rust in  <dig> and  <dig>  in  <dig>  the assessments of artificially inoculated asr and naturally occurring common smut were conducted on the plants in nlb trial. in  <dig> and  <dig>  derived nils were grown in separate field plots for different disease evaluations. trials for stewart's wilt and common rust were planted following the previously described alpha design, with two replicates, five blocks per replicate, and four experimental rows plus two b <dig> rows per block. trials for asr were planted following the same alpha design, with two replicates, two blocks per replicate, and seven experimental rows plus four b <dig> rows per block. plants in the trials of common smut were randomized in two replicates.

four genotypes were used for microscopic analysis and dna-based real time pcr quantification: b <dig>  tx <dig>  tbbc3-38-05f , and tbbc3-42-10e- <dig> . three greenhouse trials  and one field trial  were conducted from december  <dig> to july  <dig>  real-time pcr quantification was not performed in the  <dig> field trial. in the greenhouse, plants subject to the same treatment were randomized within a block in order to eliminate the variance due to environmental factors.

data analysis
mixed model analyses were performed in jmp  <dig>  for the field trails following an alpha design. for trials conducted in one field location, "maize lines" was specified as a fixed factor, whereas "replicates" and "blocks within replicates" were specified as random. data from the  <dig> trials in ny and nc were analyzed separately because of the different field arrangements and disease rating scales. a combined analysis across two locations  was conducted for the  <dig> trials by fitting a mixed model with "maize lines", "locations" and "maize lines by locations" as fixed factors, and "replicates within locations" and "blocks within replicates within locations" as random effects. phenotypic differences between tbbc <dig> lines/nils and b <dig>  or between any two nils, were determined by pair-wise comparisons of least squares means using two-tailed student's t-test at p <  <dig> . correction for multiple comparisons was not made since all the tests were independent. the tbbc <dig> lines and derived nils were each compared to the recurrent parent b <dig>  and pairs of nils were only compared to each other when sharing identical genotypes except for the target introgression under testing. overall comparisons of tbbc <dig> lines or nils were not intended in this analysis.

the qtl effect of each marker locus was investigated in the full tbbc <dig> population. considering the presence of unlinked, potentially unrecognized introgressed segments in the same lines, a series of statistical tests was conducted as described by szalma et al.  <cit>  with some modification. markers likely associated with resistance  were identified by: 1) comparing the least squares mean of tbbc <dig> lines homozygous for tx <dig> alleles at each locus to the least squares mean of b <dig> rows, and 2) performing one-way analysis of variance  on an individual marker - trait basis in the tbbc <dig> population. significant markers were grouped into linked introgression blocks, and the markers with the greatest significance in each linked block were considered to reflect the most likely qtl position. correlations between the most significant markers were checked. for each pair of unlinked but correlated markers, tbbc <dig> lines fixed for one marker were grouped and analyzed for the co-segregation of the second marker and disease traits, using two-tailed student's t test at p <  <dig> . a putative qtl was declared if the mean of all the lines with tx <dig> alleles at this locus was significantly different from b <dig>  and significant difference was detected for lines contrasting for this locus under the condition of another potential qtl locus being fixed.

in segregating populations, the phenotypic and genotypic data were first analyzed by mixed stepwise regression, with a significance probability of p <  <dig>  for each parameter to enter/leave the model  <cit> . once the markers significantly associated with the traits were identified, anova was conducted on a single marker basis at p <  <dig>  to estimate qtl effects. for the populations with more than one marker showing significant effect on traits, the effective markers were further tested for epistatic interactions by examining marker pairs by two-way anova. allele effects were determined by pair-wise two-tailed student's t test according to the least significant difference  at p =  <dig> .

the proportion data from microscopic analysis and qpcr were transformed to arcsine of the square roots prior to statistical analysis. arcsine transformed data were analyzed by fitting a linear least squares model with "genotype" and "replicate" as two independent variables, and with the number in the denominator of each proportion as a weighting factor. for qpcr, considering the biological and technical replicates, the fungal biomass ratios were also arcsine square-root transformed, but were analyzed with a different linear least squares model of yijm = β <dig> + β <dig>  + β <dig>  + β <dig> ) + eijm . least squares means and 95% confidence intervals were back-transformed to percentages. confidence intervals were larger than significance levels due to asymmetry resulting from back transformation of arcsine scale. the significant qtl effects were estimated by pair-wise comparisons of least squares means of introgression lines/nils and b <dig> using two-tailed student's t-test at p <  <dig> . all the statistical analyses in the study were conducted using jmp  <dig> .

RESULTS
a stepwise strategy  was conducted to map and characterize qtl using the tbbc <dig> introgression lines and derived nils.

identification of outliers and putative nlb qtl in the tbbc <dig> population
the full set of  <dig> tbbc <dig> lines was screened for nlb resistance at field sites in new york and north carolina in  <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig>  the tbbc <dig> population was generally more susceptible than b <dig> at both locations. in the trial at aurora ny, three lines were scored as significantly more resistant and  <dig> lines were scored as significantly more susceptible than b <dig> for primary dla, while no lines showed significantly more resistance and  <dig> lines showed more susceptibility than b <dig> based on audpc. in the trial at clayton nc, eight lines were significantly more resistant and  <dig> lines were significantly more susceptible than b <dig> for audpc. the only line that showed contrasting phenotypes in the two environments was tbbc3- <dig>  suggesting experimental error or environmental influence on the expression of nlb qtl.

a combination of analytic approaches was used to associate the resistance or susceptibility effects with specific chromosomal segments  <cit> . based on this analysis,  <dig> putative nlb qtl were identified in the tbbc <dig> population . except for bins  <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> , the putative qtl co-localized with nlb qtl previously detected in four maize mapping populations  <cit> .

phenotypic evaluation on the subset of  <dig> tbbc <dig> lines
a subset of  <dig> tbbc <dig> lines was selected for further evaluation based on the degree of difference in nlb resistance between each individual tbbc <dig> line and b <dig> at the two field sites . lines significantly or marginally different  from b <dig> in either of the two locations were taken into consideration. line selection was also influenced by the identity of the tx <dig> introgressions carried by the lines; those carrying introgressions corresponding both to putative qtl identified in the tbbc <dig> population , and to previously reported nlb qtl  were given priority because of our interest in qtl validation and characterization rather than in qtl discovery.

in  <dig>  the same set of plant materials was inoculated at the five- to six-leaf stage in new york  and north carolina , and were grown in a separate field plot in ny and inoculated 1- <dig> weeks before anthesis. trait values shown are the least squares means of maize lines relative to the recurrent parent b <dig>  phenotypes that were significantly more resistant than b <dig> are highlighted in bold, while the phenotypes significantly more susceptible than b <dig> are underscored. the significance level was determined by pair-wise two-tailed student's t test on the least square difference . maize lines in bold are the ones that were consistently more resistant or more susceptible than b <dig> across two field environments.

c individual tbbc <dig> lines in each field environment were inspected. tbbc3- <dig> was significantly more resistant than b <dig> for ip , dla <dig> , dla <dig>  and audpc  only in nc. tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3- <dig> showed greater susceptibility than b <dig> for three dla ratings  and audpc  only in ny. the same differential degrees of resistance or susceptibility in two field environments were also observed in  <dig> .

d resistance to nlb was more effective in adult plants.

in  <dig>  the  <dig> selected lines were evaluated at the same field locations in ny and nc to confirm their disease phenotypes. significant "line" effects  were found for all disease parameters in each of ny and nc, and across two locations. in the combined analysis across environments, significant effects of "location"  and "line-by-location"  were also detected. the variations were attributed to dissimilar pathogen strains, environmental conditions and disease ratings conducted by different scorers at two sites. inspection of individual tbbc <dig> lines in ny and nc respectively suggested that most of the lines performed similarly across the two locations. pair-wise comparisons validated the phenotypic differences for seven out of the  <dig> tbbc <dig> lines and b <dig> . consistently in ny and nc, tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3- <dig> were more resistant, whereas tbbc3- <dig>  tbbc3- <dig>  tbbc3- <dig>  tbbc3- <dig>  and tbbc3- <dig> were more susceptible than b <dig> 

ten selected tbbc <dig> lines showed significantly greater dta than b <dig> , indicating the presence of flowering time qtl in those lines. to test the effect of plant development on qtl expression, the  <dig> selected lines were inoculated at juvenile and adult stages  and their disease traits were compared. in all the lines, qtl effects in reducing or increasing resistance to nlb were generally consistent for juvenile and adult plant stages. no lines showed contrasting phenotypes  when inoculated at the five- to six-leaf stage or just before flowering, which suggested that allele effects of nlb qtl were not altered by developmental stage. there was, however, evidence suggesting that the effectiveness of qtl might change over plant development. the resistance in tbbc3- <dig>  tbbc3- <dig>  tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3- <dig> was more effective in adult than in juvenile individuals. the formation of nlb lesions was delayed by around  <dig> - <dig> days on mature plants of the same genotypes.

validation of qtl effects by linkage analysis
each of the tbbc <dig> lines had more than one identified introgression from tx <dig>  to determine which of the introgressed regions in a given line was associated with resistance, several segregating bc4f <dig> populations were developed from crosses between selected tbbc <dig> lines  and the recurrent parent b <dig>  the bc4f <dig> individuals from each cross were evaluated for nlb resistance and genotyped using markers for the respective introgressed regions. significant trait-marker associations were identified in all the bc4f <dig> populations under investigation .

the qtl at bin  <dig>  was found effective in two segregating populations: those derived from tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3- <dig>  although the introgressed region extended from bin  <dig> - <dig> , higher significance was detected at the marker located at bin  <dig>  so the qtl was designated qnlb <dig> . in the bc4f <dig> derived from tbbc3- <dig>  ~14% of the ip variation could be attributed to qnlb <dig> . the b <dig> allele at qnlb <dig>  was associated with slower disease development. individuals homozygous for tx <dig> alleles in bin  <dig>   were significantly more susceptible than b <dig>  the tx <dig> homozygotes showed lesions ~ <dig>  days earlier  and lesions expanded more rapidly by ~ <dig>  mm/day  in the b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> population. the same qtl acted differently in the b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> population. while qnlb <dig>  was effective in reducing dla and audpc, no effect on ip was observed in the b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> population. it is worth noting that tbbc3- <dig> is a much more susceptible genotype than tbbc3- <dig>  which provided a better background for evaluating minor disease qtl.

the qtl at bin  <dig>  was not identified based on previously reported genotype information. although clear phenotypic variation was observed on ip and dla in the bc4f <dig> populations from tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3- <dig>  no significant association was found between ip and the known introgressions at bins  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig> , and  <dig> - <dig> . the ip on bc4f <dig> individuals of tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3- <dig> ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, while ip on b <dig> was generally between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. since these two populations displayed a greater variation in resistance, we inferred that a disease qtl was present in the population but not associated with a recognized introgression. to search for unrecognized introgressions, an additional  <dig> ssr markers across the genome were chosen to target chromosomal regions that were not well-covered by the original  <dig> rflp and ssr markers on tbbc <dig> map. pooled dna samples from bc4f <dig> individuals of tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3- <dig>  along with b <dig> dna as a control, were tested with the additional ssr markers for heterozygosity. among the  <dig> ssr markers tested, umc <dig> and umc <dig>  were the only polymorphic markers segregating in both bc4f <dig> populations. this indicated the presence of a tx <dig> introgression at bin  <dig>  in both tbbc3- <dig> and tbc3- <dig>  individuals in each population were then genotyped with umc <dig> and umc <dig>  and analyzed for the effects on various disease components. a highly significant association was detected for various parameters in both populations . in the b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> and b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> populations, around 33% and 53%  of the variation in audpc was explained by this qtl. compared to the b <dig> allele, the tx <dig> allele at qnlb <dig>  increased the ip by ~ <dig> days, decreased le by ~ <dig>  mm per day, and reduced dla by about 5-10%. another qtl at bins  <dig> - <dig>   was found in the b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> population. the effect was relatively minor  compared to the qnlb <dig> tx <dig> identified in the same population.

qtl were also identified in bins  <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig> , and  <dig> - <dig> . although contributing significant levels of resistance for ip or dla in the b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> and b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> populations, the same introgressions/markers were not found effective in the populations derived from tbbc3- <dig>  tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3- <dig>  the ambiguous results called the association into question, suggesting that the effectiveness of qtl at bins  <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig> , and  <dig> - <dig>  was affected by genetic background and/or environmental conditions.

validation of qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> in selected nil sets
to confirm the qtl effects detected in segregating populations, nils were generated by selfing selected bc4f <dig> lines from the populations b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig>  b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> and b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig>  selected lines were chosen to represent different introgressed regions in the original tbbc <dig> lines. the qtl effects were determined by pair-wise comparisons between individual introgression lines and b <dig>  and between the nils developed from a tbbc <dig> line. within each set of nils, lines contrasting for each marker locus were grouped and analyzed for their phenotypic differences. the nils derived from different tbbc <dig> lines were not compared to each other since the phenotypic difference can be attributed to not only introgressed regions but also to minor differences in genetic backgrounds.

evaluations of the bc4f <dig> nils validated the effects of qnlb <dig> tx <dig>  five nils derived from b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> and four nils derived from b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> were phenotyped in  <dig>  individual trait-locus analysis in the two nil sets revealed that bin  <dig>  was the only locus that showed significant effects on resistance. the qtl effect at bin  <dig> - <dig>  was detected in the b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> population, but was not confirmed in the nils. as shown in additional file  <dig>  most of the nils carrying tx <dig> alleles at bin  <dig>  were significantly more resistant than b <dig>  the only exception was the line tbbc3-39-11a, which might have lost the resistance gene due to recombination. significant differences between lines with qnlb <dig> tx <dig> and b <dig> were observed for ip, dla and audpc, which was in agreement with the results from linkage analysis in bc4f <dig> populations . the effects of qnlb <dig> tx <dig> relative to qnlb <dig> b <dig> on ip  and dla  were determined by comparing tbbc3-38-05f with b <dig>  and tbbc3-39-19e with b <dig>  the significant effect of reducing lesion expansion was not confirmed in the nils. lines with qnlb <dig> tx <dig> even showed significantly higher le scores, indicating some variations from different genetic backgrounds and environments.

qnlb <dig>  was validated by analyzing six bc4f <dig> nils and seven bc4f <dig> nils derived from a b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> cross. evaluations conducted in  <dig> and  <dig> led to similar results. since bc4f <dig> nils had cleaner genetic backgrounds, the data from the  <dig> trial was shown to represent the overall result. individual trait-locus analysis in this nil set suggested that bin  <dig> - <dig>  was the only locus affecting resistance. the nils carrying tx <dig> allele at bin  <dig> - <dig>  were all significantly more susceptible than the ones carrying b <dig> allele at the same region , confirming the resistance effect of qnlb <dig> b <dig>  highly significant differences between tbbc3-42-10e- <dig>  and b <dig> were observed across all the disease components under investigation . the b <dig> allele at qnlb <dig>  delayed lesion formation by  <dig>  days , inhibited lesion expansion by  <dig>  mm per day , and reduced dla 18-38% through the season . overall, the relative allele effects detected in the nils were much greater than in the segregating populations, and the resistance of qnlb <dig> b <dig> was more effective in the field than in the greenhouse.

characterization of qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> using derived nils
two derived nils carrying identified nlb qtl in "cleaner" b <dig> backgrounds  were chosen for detailed qtl characterization. tbbc3-38-05f was a bc4f <dig> nil with a tx <dig> introgression at bin  <dig>  , and tbbc3-42-10e- <dig> was a bc4f <dig> nil with a tx <dig> introgression at bin  <dig>  . to investigate the effect of qtl during nlb development, a series of disease components  was selected or developed and applied on the two derived nils in three replicated experiments in the greenhouse during december  <dig> - april  <dig>  and at aurora, ny during summer  <dig> 

microscopic investigation on the pathogenesis of s. turcica
trypan blue staining and koh-aniline blue fluorescence microscopy techniques were used for histological examination of nlb development in planta. to understand typical resistant and susceptible interaction patterns in the nlb pathosystem, preliminary microscopic analysis was conducted on the following maize lines challenged with s. turcica: b <dig>  tx <dig>  tbbc3- <dig>  tbbc3- <dig>  the resistant maize inbred line cml <dig> and cml <dig>  and a susceptible recombinant inbred line ibm <dig>  as illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  pathogenesis was successfully visualized and can be summarized as follows. after landing and attaching on the leaf surface of a susceptible maize plant, the conidium of s. turcica germinates. it forms an appressorium, which produces a penetration peg that punches through the cell wall and into the epidermal cell. from this cell, infective hyphae are produced, grow towards the vascular bundle, enter the vasculature and ramify within it. aggressive hyphal growth and extension in the vascular bundles can be seen. the hyphae can grow for several days inside the vascular bundles without causing visible symptoms . after extensive growth within the vascular veins, hyphae grow out to colonize the neighboring bundle sheath cells and then branch out to colonize the rest of leaves. this progression is consistent with several previous studies on s. turcica pathogenesis on maize  <cit> . the limited damage s. turcica causes to host tissues at early phase of pathogenesis and the extended incubation period suggests the possibility that this is a hemibiotrophic interaction.

among diverse maize genotypes  and on genotypes carrying different qtl for resistance , differential phenotypes were observed for the timing and extent of certain steps in the processes of infection and colonization. to document these differences, a series of microscopic parameters was chosen for characterizing nlb qtl efficacy at different stages during pathogenesis. the microscopic disease components used in the study included the number of appressoria, infection efficiency, vascular invasion efficiency, the size of strongly fluorescent area surrounding the infection site, and the appearance of necrotic or fortified vascular bundles. the microscopic evaluations on b <dig>  tx <dig> and the derived nils were performed on plants grown in controlled greenhouse conditions as well as in the field.

qtl effect on the infection of s. turcica
infection efficiency was examined by trypan blue and koh-aniline blue staining, followed by scoring the number of conidia that had successfully penetrated the epidermal cell walls. the infection efficiency was defined as the ratio of successful infection sites over the total number of germinated conidia. non-germinated conidia were excluded because of the difficulty of determining whether a non-germinated conidium was viable, given the fact that a small proportion of damaged conidia was always present in the spore suspension. in both the greenhouse and field, lower infection efficiency was consistently observed on the nil with qnlb <dig> tx <dig> at earlier time points examined, as well as on tx <dig> at all time points examined , compared with b <dig>  in the greenhouse, qnlb <dig> tx <dig> reduced infection efficiency by ~14% at  <dig> dpi and by ~24% at  <dig> dpi . similarly, in the field, infection efficiency was reduced by ~12% at  <dig> dpi  relative to b <dig>  the resistant parental genotype tx <dig> showed a stronger effect on reducing the infection of s. turcica in the field  than in the greenhouse . no significant effect on pathogen penetration was seen from qnlb <dig> tx <dig> 

the incidence of multiple appressoria per germinated conidium was used as another indicator for resistance to fungal penetration. it was observed that when a germinated conidium failed to penetrate the epidermis, the conidium would continue to produce new germ tubes and appressoria until exhausting its reserves or ultimately gaining entry into a plant cell . despite the effect of qnlb <dig> tx <dig> on reducing the penetration of s. turcica, no difference was detected on the formation of multiple appressoria among b <dig>  tx <dig>  and the derived nils.

qtl effect on the vascular invasion of s. turcica
intracellular hyphal growth from the initially infected epidermal cell to surrounding mesophyll cells, and the subsequent invasion of the vascular bundle, were investigated by koh-aniline blue fluorescence microscopy. vascular invasion efficiency was defined as the incidence of hyphal growth into the vasculature per infection site. differences in vascular invasion efficiency were observed between b <dig> and the other genotypes . the nil with qnlb <dig> tx <dig> had greater vascular invasion efficiency, indicating the superiority of the b <dig> allele at this locus. replacement of the b <dig> allele with the tx <dig> allele at qnlb <dig>   led to 15-24% of increase in the incidence of vascular invasion in both greenhouse and field . the qnlb <dig> tx <dig> allele was not effective for inhibiting hyphal growth into the vasculature. under greenhouse conditions, the nil with qnlb <dig> tx <dig> was observed to have a 7-19% higher susceptibility for vascular invasion , which is a further indication that this qtl functions at the stage of penetration but not at later stages of pathogenesis. the susceptibility to vascular invasion was also seen in tx <dig>  in the greenhouse, higher vascular invasion efficiencies were observed in tx <dig> than in b <dig>  although with marginal significance levels. in the field, the invasion efficiency in tx <dig> was ~22% greater than in b <dig> .

qtl effects on the accumulation of defense compounds around the infection site
infected tissues stained with aniline blue were also used for revealing defense responses induced upon pathogen challenge. the fluorescence emitted from the cells surrounding the infection site is presumably due to callose deposition  <cit>  and the accumulation of autofluorescent phenolic compounds  <cit> . callose and phenolics are antimicrobial compounds that help restrict the establishment and spread of s. turcica in the leaf. in susceptible genotypes, weak fluorescence and collapsed cells were generally observed around the infected sites , suggesting the lack of induced defense responses. the more resistant genotypes showed enhanced fluorescence from localized cell regions .

to assess the degree of defense response around the primary infected cell, the diameter of brightly fluorescing area was measured under a fluorescence microscope with a micrometer . the average diameter of the fluorescing area in the nil with qnlb <dig> tx <dig> was consistently smaller than that seen for b <dig> , indicating that the b <dig> allele at qnlb <dig>  contribute to the regulation, production or accumulation of callose, lignin or other phenolic compounds. interestingly, compared to b <dig>  the fluorescing area in the nil with qnlb <dig> tx <dig> was slightly larger  in the field, but was significantly smaller  at  <dig> dpi in the greenhouse, suggesting that the phenotype conferred by qnlb <dig> tx <dig> is vulnerable to environmental influences.

considering the potential role of vascular resistance in the nlb pathosystem, the incidence of brightly fluorescing vascular bundles  was also evaluated. although this response was pronounced in cml <dig> , this type of resistance was rarely observed in b <dig>  tx <dig> and the derived nils. the induced defense reaction around the infection site was fairly weak at all times examined in either greenhouse or field conditions. it was thus not considered a relevant parameter for testing the effect of qnlb <dig> tx <dig> and qnlb <dig> b <dig> 

qtl effect on mycelial growth of s. turcica in planta
dna-based qpcr was developed to precisely quantify mycelial growth of s. turcica in maize leaves. the r-square values for the two standard curves based on b <dig> and tx <dig> respectively were both higher than  <dig>  , indicating that the designed its primer pair had good sensitivity and specificity for reliably amplifying fungal dna. to assess the qpcr technique as a tool for analyzing the nlb pathosystem, several time-course experiments were performed on seven maize genotypes with a wide range of differential levels of nlb resistance . preliminary results showed that the levels of fungal dna ratios determined by qpcr approximately conformed to the performance of resistance in the field. for maize genotypes with low to intermediate levels of resistance, fungal dna was detected as early as three days after inoculation. the detectable fungal dna ratios increased over time until the end of the incubation period , and thereafter decreased. this reduction in pathogen dna was unexpected, and apparently corresponded to a loss of dna integrity. dna samples extracted from tissues showing lesions were usually brownish and of poor quality. the decrease in detectable fungal dna ratio in highly diseased leaves is contradictory to our microscopic observation of abundant mycelial growth in nlb lesions. it is likely that in tissues with actively developing lesions, more dna-degrading enzymes involving in cell death are present and can digest fungal dna during the extraction. to better differentiate resistant and susceptible responses, it is critical to apply qpcr on infected tissues taken prior to the appearance of necrotic lesions on the most susceptible genotype in an experimental set.

infected leaves from b <dig>  tx <dig>  and two derived nils were collected nine days after inoculation , and measured for their fungal dna content using qpcr. as shown in figure 6b, neither tx <dig> nor qnlb <dig> tx <dig> showed significant effect on reducing the growth of s. turcica in leaves. however, the fungal biomass ratio  in the nil with qnlb <dig> tx <dig> was 24% higher than in b <dig> , indicating that the in planta development of s. turcica is more extensive on plants without qnlb <dig> b <dig> 

preliminary characterization of potential qtl effects for multiple disease resistance using derived nils
significant differences were observed between tx <dig> and b <dig> for resistance to stewart's wilt, anthracnose stalk rot , common smut and common rust. in the field, tx <dig> was more resistant to stewart's wilt and asr, while b <dig> was more resistant to common smut and common rust. to investigate the resistance spectrum of qnlb <dig>  and qnlb <dig> , several nils derived from b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig>  b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> and b <dig> × tbbc3- <dig> were evaluated for the four diseases . the choice of nils was constrained by the availability of seeds.

the evidence suggested that both qnlb <dig> tx <dig> and qnlb <dig> b <dig> were effective for resistance to stewart's wilt. as shown in additional file  <dig>  all the nils carrying tx <dig> introgression at bin  <dig>  were significantly more resistant than b <dig>  based on comparing tbbc3-39-19e to b <dig>  qnlb <dig> tx <dig> was inferred to be effective for reducing lesions of stewart's wilt on inoculated leaves by as much as 39% . likewise, in additional file  <dig>  lines with tx <dig> alleles at bin  <dig> - <dig>  were significantly more susceptible than b <dig>  the effect of qnlb <dig> b <dig> on stewart's wilt was estimated as reducing 19% of primary dla based on a comparison of tbbc3-42-10e- <dig> and b <dig> . significant differences were also observed among the lines fixed  at bins  <dig> - <dig> , indicating that there are qtl other than qnlb <dig> b <dig> segregating in the nil set. however, none of the rest of the introgressed regions were unambiguously associated with resistance.

qnlb <dig> tx <dig> was ineffective for resistance to asr, smut and rust. no phenotypic difference in the development of rust and smut galls was detected among b <dig>  tbbc3- <dig>  tbbc3- <dig> and their derived nils. significant difference in discolored internode area was observed between tbbc3- <dig> and b <dig> , but the variation was not associated with qnlb <dig> , as tbbc3- <dig> and the nil carrying a single introgression at bin  <dig>   showed the same resistance level as b <dig> .

qnlb <dig> b <dig> was ineffective for resistance to asr and common smut, but potentially effective for resistance to common rust . for asr, some phenotypic difference was found among b <dig>  tbbc3- <dig> and derived nils, but none of the identified introgressed regions were associated with resistance. b <dig> was more resistant than tx <dig> for common smut and common rust. for common smut, there were almost no ear galls or stalk galls observed on b <dig>  tbbc3- <dig> and tbbc3-42-10e- <dig>  suggesting that introgressed segments in tbbc3- <dig> did not affect smut development. , and the finding was not consistent with the  <dig> result). for common rust, except for tbbc3-42-06f- <dig>  lines with tx <dig> alleles at bin  <dig> - <dig>  were consistently more susceptible than b <dig> for all three severity ratings  and audpc . the result indicated the possibility of rust qtl at bins  <dig> - <dig>  and/or unidentified introgressed regions in tbbc3- <dig> 

discussion
identification of nlb qtl using tbbc <dig> introgression lines
two qtl for resistance to nlb, qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig>  were successfully identified, validated and characterized using a population of introgression lines and derived nils. we applied a stepwise strategy that allowed phenotyping of informative nils over a series of generations. a special field design, in which each row of cssl/nil arranged next to a row of b <dig>  allowed accurate visual comparisons and a relatively uniform epidemic across the field. we detected and sequentially validated qtl using multiple disease components, in a full set of  <dig> lines, a subset of  <dig> selected lines, five selected bc4f <dig> populations, and three sets of derived bc4f3/bc4f <dig> nils. our primary hypothesis that individual qtl affect distinct stage of nlb development was ultimately confirmed using two selected nils  in repeated greenhouse and field trials, with a panel of conventional and novel components. our results revealed that qnlb <dig> tx <dig> and qnlb <dig> b <dig> are mainly effective against the infection and colonization of s. turcica, respectively. we found that the qtl were both effective in both juvenile and adult plants, and that both chromosomal segments were associated with resistance to more than one disease.

the mechanism underlying resistance conferred by qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> is unlikely to be the same as the mechanism underlying qualitative resistance conferred by currently known major genes. qualitative resistance to nlb is generally characterized by chlorotic-necrotic lesions  <cit> , chlorotic halo lesions  <cit> , or extremely prolonged ip  <cit> . considerable levels of resistance were seen for qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> in the two field sites, without observing distinct lesion type or much greater ip. moreover, although co-localized nlb qtl at bins  <dig>  and  <dig>  have been reported in other populations  <cit> , no major genes have been mapped to these chromosomal regions.

conventional and newly-developed components of resistance targeting different stages of nlb development
qtl effects were analyzed using five conventional macroscopic disease parameters and four microscopic parameters. each of the macroscopic components reflected different phase of disease development. incubation period quantifies the time to appearance of wilted lesions, which reflects the speed of xylem plugging due to extensive hyphal growth in the veins. lesion expansion quantifies the rate of expansion of wilted and necrotic lesions, which reflects the speed of destructive hyphal growth in the leaves. ratings for diseased leaf area, disease severity and area under the disease progress curve, on the other hand, involve visual quantification of overall disease progress on the entire plant. in our greenhouse and field trials, ip showed a better correlation than le with dla, disease severity and audpc. this indicates that ip is a more discriminating parameter than le for measuring nlb severity. this confirms previous reports that ip is a convenient target trait in selection and breeding for resistance to nlb  <cit> . in a recurrent selection study for nlb resistance, selection for prolonged ip resulted in ~ <dig> % more gain in reducing audpc per selection cycle compared to selection for lesion length  <cit> .

qtl effects were also microscopically investigated at the pre-penetration, infection, and colonization phases. in most fungal pathosystems, pre-penetration resistance is associated with specialized physical and chemical features of plant surface which help reduce the incidence of landing, adhesion, germination, appressorium formation and penetration of pathogenic fungi  <cit> . post-penetration resistance to microbial attack, on the other hand, is characterized by programmed necrosis, along with the induction of callose, lignin, phenolic compounds and other pathogenesis-related proteins around the primary-infected cell. four microscopic components, including the incidence of multiple appressoria, infection efficiency, accumulation of defense materials surrounding the infection site, and vascular invasion efficiency, were developed to complement the conventional macroscopic components. modified trypan blue staining  <cit>  and koh-aniline blue fluorescence  <cit>  methods were useful in determining the degree and timing of allelic contribution to quantitative resistance to nlb. previous studies utilizing sectioning and electron microscopy have revealed that xylem plugging is a key stage for the formation of nlb lesions . our microscopic examination using koh-aniline blue fluorescence technique confirmed the finding and allowed the observation of in planta colonization of s. turcica from a different angle. in all the maize genotypes examined, the mycelium appeared to grow preferentially towards vascular bundle, initially invading the vasculature, then extending through the xylem vessel, and eventually, aggressively growing out to the neighboring mesophyll tissues. to our knowledge, the mechanisms of the post-infection directional growth of vascular fungal pathogens remain to be elucidated.

qpcr was employed for the first time for the measurement of in planta biomass of s. turcica. although it has been widely applied in other pathosystems, qpcr can only be used for nlb quantification at early stages of pathogenesis. the accuracy and differentiating power are highly dependent on uniform inoculation and precise sampling at the early stages of pathogenesis, so the method is best suited to work conducted under controlled conditions. the biggest constraint of this technique comes from its not being able to measure the destructive mycelial growth in the blighted leaf areas, possibly due to the poor quality of dna extracted from necrotic tissues. the cost of qpcr reagents and the required workload make it unfeasible for regular phenotypic screening. however, qpcr serves as a good tool for quantifying the degree of earlier mycelial colonization of s. turcica in maize leaves.

hypothesis #1: individual qtl affect distinct stages of disease development
detailed macroscopic and microscopic evaluations revealed the distinct features of qnlb <dig> tx <dig> and qnlb <dig> b <dig> in nlb development. qnlb <dig> tx <dig> conditions resistance mainly against the penetration of s. turcica. the anti-penetration effect was observed at earlier but not later time points examined, indicating that qnlb <dig> tx <dig> acts in a quantitative manner, which delays rather than prevents the occurrence of infection. in contrast, qnlb <dig> b <dig> appears to condition resistance not to infection, but rather by enhancing the induction of defense reactions surrounding infection sites, as well as by inhibiting hyphal growth into the vascular bundle, and the subsequent necrotrophic colonization in the leaves. it is difficult to infer whether the resistance is associated with defense reactions in mesophyll, parenchyma, bundle sheath and/or other cells.

delaying the invasion and extension of s. turcica in the vascular system was shown to be critical for quantitative resistance to nlb. this is consistent with previous microscopic analyses  <cit>  suggested that xylem invasion/plugging is an important pathogenetic phase in nlb progress. polygenic resistance  has been associated with reduced hyphal spread into the xylem  <cit> . the significance of protecting the vasculature from hyphal invasion is supported by the evidence that the replacement of superior b <dig> allele with tx <dig> allele at qnlb <dig>  led to an 18-38% higher dla . incorporating a qtl effective in slowing down the invasion of the vasculature would thus considerably increase overall resistance.

we speculate that preventing the attachment of conidia and the subsequent infection plays a role in quantitative resistance to nlb in the donor line tx <dig>  although this was not quantified, it was visually obvious that the number of spores per leaf segment of tx <dig> was lower than the spore numbers on b <dig> or the nils carrying qnlb <dig> tx <dig> and qnlb <dig> b <dig>  lower infection efficiency of s. turcica was observed for tx <dig> relative to b <dig>  interestingly, tx <dig> showed a greater susceptibility than b <dig> for the parameters of vascular invasion efficiency, enhanced fluoresced area, and lesion expansion. despite the lack of resistance in delaying vascular invasion and extension of s. turcica in tx <dig>  its higher effectiveness in reducing spore attachment and infection may contribute to the overall moderate resistance to nlb.

hypothesis #2: the effectiveness of disease qtl is affected by plant maturity
a number of maize diseases caused by hemibiotrophic fungi  and necrotrophic fungi  are known to progress more rapidly on the plants after anthesis  <cit> . in maize, a significant correlation has been detected between disease resistance and flowering time in a panel of  <dig> diverse lines . the fact that flowering time may account for a considerable proportion of resistance variation leads to the hypotheses that the effects of disease qtl reflect indirect expression of flowering time qtl, and/or that the effects of disease qtl are modulated differently at varied plant developmental stages. in fact, several qtl identified in biparental populations are associated with both nlb resistance and flowering time .

the association between nlb qtl and plant maturity was investigated in the subset of  <dig> selected tbbc <dig> lines. to separate resistance effects from maturity effects, plants in two different fields were inoculated at juvenile and adult stage  respectively, and evaluated for nlb resistance and flowering time. generally consistent expression of resistance or susceptibility was observed at the two stages, implying that the effectiveness of these qtl was not altered substantially by plant maturity. while several of the introgression lines  showed significantly different flowering times relative to b <dig>  the interactions between nlb qtl and flowering time qtl were relatively minor. for the qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig>  the analysis of advanced nil sets further provided strong evidence of their independence from flowering time. this agrees with a previous report of flowering-time qtl in tbbc <dig> introgression lines  <cit> : bins  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig>  were not among the qtl affecting days to anthesis, days to silking, or anthesis-silking interval.

hypothesis #3: the effectiveness of qtl is affected by environmental conditions
a major limitation for qtl applications is the lack of consistency of qtl effects across environments. the inconsistent detection of qtl has been associated with experimental errors and differential gene expression affected by environmental factors  <cit> . in view of the widely reported inconsistency, the present study revealed that the introgressions/qtl with relatively large effects  were consistent in their performance across field sites and years. reliable expression of these qtl, including qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig>  suggests their applicability to resistance breeding.

disease resistance can be expressed differentially, not only in different field environments but also under field versus greenhouse conditions . differential efficacy of qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> in controlled greenhouse and field conditions was evaluated using macroscopic and microscopic phenotypes. it should be noted that due to the different inoculation and sampling treatments necessarily employed in different environments, the comparison between the effectiveness of disease qtl in the greenhouse and field should be addressed based on relative observation rather than the absolute values. our overall results suggest that the resistance of qnlb <dig> b <dig> was stably expressed in the greenhouse and field, whereas qnlb <dig> tx <dig> conferred a higher level of resistance in the field than in the greenhouse. macroscopically, the effects of qnlb <dig> tx <dig> on ip and primary dla in greenhouse-grown plants were occasionally insignificant. microscopically, the positive effect of qnlb <dig> tx <dig> on triggering defense response surrounding the initially infected cell was only detected in the field. greenhouse-grown plants carrying qnlb <dig> tx <dig>  however, displayed an opposite effect , which suggests that this type of resistance is highly affected by environmental factors. the observation that qnlb <dig> tx <dig> increased the efficiency of s. turcica invasion into vasculature in the greenhouse but not field, may be an indirect effect of decreased accumulation of host defensive materials at the post-infection stage.

hypothesis #4: qtl for resistance to nlb comprises genes or gene clusters involving in broad-spectrum resistance
the phenomenon of multiple disease resistance  has been inferred based on the detection of qtl clusters affecting different diseases  <cit> , genetic correlations in populations  <cit> , non-specific defense mechanisms , and genes . maize bins  <dig>  and  <dig>  have been previously associated with a number of disease qtl mapped in diverse maize populations  <cit> . our evaluations of resistance to common rust, stewart's wilt, anthracnose stalk rot, common smut, and common rust in sets of nils suggest that both qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> encompass gene contributing nonspecific defense effects. qnlb <dig> b <dig> was effective in decreasing nlb, common rust and stewart's wilt, while qnlb <dig> tx <dig> was effective in decreasing nlb and stewart's wilt. nevertheless, due to the low resolution of qtl localization in this study, it is unclear whether the nonspecific resistance of qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> is caused by pleiotropy or linkage, or whether their effects are mongenic or polygenic. although the underlying mechanisms are unknown, the feature of broad-spectrum resistance makes the two identified disease qtl appealing in practical applications.

it is worth noting that the nils carrying qnlb <dig> tx <dig> showed remarkable resistance against stewart's wilt, suggesting the involvement of major gene effect. in fact, a dominant major gene locus for stewart's wilt, sw <dig>  has been mapped to bin  <dig> - <dig>  in inbred line ki <dig>  <cit> . the co-localization of qtl for resistance to nlb and stewart's wilt has also been observed in the nils derived from the inbred line cml <dig> crossed to b <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
our research has led to successful identification of two reliably-expressed qtl that can potentially be utilized to protect maize from s. turcica in different environments. map-based cloning will reveal more about the genes and mechanisms underlying the distinct features of qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> in the pre-penetration, penetration and post-penetration phases of pathogenesis. large mapping populations have been generated from the nils and fine-mapping of qnlb <dig> b <dig> and qnlb <dig> tx <dig> is in progress.
