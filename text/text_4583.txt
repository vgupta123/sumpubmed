BACKGROUND
adaptation of nematode taxa to a parasitic life-style represents an evolutionary challenge that is likely to be met, in part, by gene duplication in a gene family and subsequent acquisition of novel gene function among its paralogous members. one group of genes that has received considerable interest in this respect are aspartic proteases. aspartic proteases are defined by having catalytic aspartic acid residues located in their active site clefts and include pepsins, renins, cathepsins d and e and chymosins  <cit> . in parasitic nematodes, aspartic proteases have been associated with digestion of host haemoglobin in the trichostrongylid haemonchus contortus and in the hookworms ancylostoma caninum and necator americanus  <cit> . moreover, the aspartic proteases of a. caninum and n. americanus each exhibit specificity in their ability to digest haemoglobin from natural versus unnatural hosts, indicating evolutionary adaptation to their host species  <cit> . consequently, several aspartic proteases are currently being developed as vaccines in trichostrongylids and hookworms, many of which demonstrate an ability to reduce worm burden and/or egg output  <cit> . aspartic proteases have also been shown to degrade skin macromolecules and aid skin penetration in hookworms, suggesting that their role in nematode parasitism is not limited to digestion of haemoglobin  <cit> . given this, the aspartic proteases may play a role in the biology of nematode parasites that do not feed on blood, such as strongyloides stercoralis, onchocerca volvulus and brugia malayi in which aspartic proteases have previously been identified  <cit> .

nematodes of the genus strongyloides infect a wide range of mammalian species, including humans and livestock, and infection occurs by skin penetration. strongyloides spp. is not blood-feeding and parasitism is believed to have arisen separately in the lineages leading to strongyloides and to the hookworms and trichostrongylids  <cit> . strongyloides provides a useful model to study the evolution of genes associated with parasitism, since both parasitic and free-living adults are present in the life-cycle . thus, one might predict that genes, including aspartic proteases, which retain distinct functions in free-living and parasitic environments, are maintained within the strongyloides genome. previously, and in support of this prediction, we have presented preliminary evidence that distinct aspartic proteases from s. ratti, a laboratory model of strongyloides infection, were differentially transcribed between free-living females and parasitic females  <cit> .

in the present study we have identified ten aspartic proteases in s. ratti using sequence data from a collection of  <dig>  cdna clones described in thompson et al.  <cit>  and evans et al.  <cit> , by novel pyrosequencing of normalised cdna using a 454-flx sequencer and from an early draft genome sequence of s. ratti http://www.sanger.ac.uk/sequencing/strongyloides/. we used comparative sequence analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction between these and other aspartic proteases, including those belonging to the non-parasitic nematodes caenorhabditis elegans and c. briggsae, to identify separate duplication events within different nematode lineages. we identified a pair of paralogous aspartic proteases in s. ratti  that have arisen as a result of a recent duplication event but for which asp-2a is highly expressed in parasitic females while asp-2b is highly expressed in free-living females, and we present a molecular model that allows this pair of paralogous genes to be placed in a structural context.

RESULTS
identification of aspartic protease sequences in s. ratti
blastx searches of  <dig>  contigs from s. ratti est sequences  and  <dig>  contigs from the pyrosequencing against the wormpep, uniprotkb/swiss-prot and nr databases revealed hits against various aspartic protease proteins. upon close inspection of the consensus sequence for each contig, eight transcripts of aspartic protease were identified, which we termed asp- <dig>  asp-2a, asp-2b, asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  and asp- <dig>  two further putative asparatic protease genes, asp- <dig> and asp- <dig>  were identified within the draft genome sequence for s. ratti . 5' race was used to complete full length coding sequences for asp-2a and asp-2b, while the full length for other transcripts were obtained using the genome sequences for s. ratti, when necessary. the only exceptions were asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> where the present state of the genome sequence did not allow for completion at the n-terminus. both nucleotide and amino-acid differences were observed across the length of all  <dig> sequences, indicating these isoforms represented distinct, paralogous loci rather than splice-site variants. orthology was determined by the phylogenetic analysis and nomenclature was assigned to each gene, where possible, based on its orthology with the published c. elegans aspartic proteases, asp- <dig> to asp- <dig>  <cit>  and to uncharacterised c. elegans aspartic proteases. due to the difficulty in assigning orthologous s. ratti transcripts to c. elegans asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> based on our phylogenetic analysis , numbers  <dig> and  <dig> were not used. the eight s. ratti aspartic protease genes with their predicted amino acid sequences were submitted to genbank . all  <dig> cdna sequence data are available from nebc envgen catalogue http://nebc.nox.ac.uk/data/envbase. a muscle alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences for each s. ratti aspartic protease is shown in figure 2a. signal peptides of the pre-proenzymes were determined and labelled in the alignment. it is known that aspartic proteases undergo a post-translational modification whereby about  <dig> residues are cleaved from the n-terminus of the proenzyme producing the mature protein and the predicted cleavage points of these proteins are also marked in the alignment . n-glycosylation site, presupposed to be necessary for lysosomal targeting, are also labelled, and as for c. elegans, the site is absent in asp- <dig> and asp- <dig>  syntichaki et al.  <cit>  have shown these two aspartic proteases are involved in neurodegeneration in c. elegans.

phylogenetic analysis of aspartic proteases
protein distance-based phylogenetic analysis of the eukaryotic aspartic protease amino acid sequences resulted in an unrooted tree with three clusters . the c. elegans sequences for aspartic proteases were used as reference for the cluster division and interpretation as follows; cluster i contained both asp- <dig> and asp-4; cluster ii c. elegans asp-1; and cluster iii contained asp- <dig>  asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> sequences. the tree could also be interpreted as two major groups, one containing asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  and the other asp- <dig>  asp- <dig> and asp- <dig>  two sequences did not group with any other; q <dig> my <dig> from b. malayi and a8wz <dig>  an uncharacterised transcript in c. briggsae. there are also three uncharacterised transcript sequences, two from c. briggsae  and one from c. elegans  which forms a small group. interestingly, the tree topology can be correlated with genomic position: in c. elegans, the asp- <dig>  asp- <dig>  asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> are located on chromosome v, whilst asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> are on chromosome x  <cit> . in the cases of branches containing c. elegans asp- <dig> and asp- <dig>  each species is represented by a single sequence. this clear evolutionary relationship allows for the naming of the corresponding s. ratti transcripts.

a similar pattern was observed for asp- <dig>  although this gene is not well represented in terms of nematode species. as expected, asp- <dig> from s. ratii and s. stercoralis are very similar, as shown by the tree. remarkably, in the group containing c. elegans asp- <dig> and four other hypothetical c. elegans proteins, c. briggsae is represented by asp- <dig> alone. this suggests that there have been a number of duplications in the asp- <dig> lineage in c. elegans since its divergence from c. briggsae. this scenario is supported by the fact that three of the c. elegans hypothetical proteins are genomic neighbours .

a different scenario was observed for the asp- <dig>  asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> c. elegans sequences, the latter two of which are contained within a monophyletic group composed exclusively of caenorhabditis sequences. this branches with a group of six s. ratti sequences, also clearly sharing a recent common origin. in a further branch are located two h. contortus sequences  <cit>  which also group together. this suggests that at least three independent duplications have occurred in this part of the protease family, one in the lineage containing c. elegans, another in the predecessor of h. contortus, and a distinct set of events in the branch leading to s. ratti. similar results were also obtained using minimum evolution and maximum parsimony phylogenetic approaches . these results mean that the naming of s. ratti sequences by orthology with their c. elegans counterparts breaks down here. note that for other species other than c. elegans, numbering of aspartic proteases does not appear to be related to evolutionary history, instead being based, for example, on the order in which genes were discovered.

analysis of the asp-2a and asp-2b protein sequences
a pair of paralogous s. ratti sequences, which we termed asp-2a and asp-2b, exhibited 76% amino-acid similarity to each other and shared a conspicuous characteristic with c. elegans asp-2: the presence of a cysteine rich insertion  near the beginning of the sequence, which consists of ~30- <dig> amino acids located between the two putative catalytic residues  <cit> . although these s. ratti sequences do not form a monophyletic cluster with c. elegans asp- <dig>  we named them asp-2a and asp-2b in recognition of this shared cysteine rich insertion. of those genes represented in our phylogenetic analysis, the cys-rich insertion was present in: q88ne <dig> and q <dig> of c. elegans; a8xv <dig>  a8x <dig> and a8xq <dig> of c. briggsae; q9n9h <dig> of n. americanus; q70je <dig>  q <dig> and q9u8g <dig> of h. contortus; and asp-2a and asp-2b of s. ratti. interestingly, the cys-rich insertion has a quite sporadic distribution: q <dig>  a8x <dig> and a8xq <dig> form the small isolated group mentioned above, while all the other sequences grouped within cluster iii of the phylogeny presented in figure  <dig>  alignment of these sequences indicated that all cys-rich insertions from these proteins shared a common ancestor: all contained  <dig> cysteine residues. with the exception of orthologous pairs from c. elegans and c. briggsae , a very recently duplicated pair from c. briggsae  and the two h. contortus sequences , sequence identity between insertions was low at 21-39% . an alignment also indicated that q88ne <dig> in c. elegans was identical to q88ne <dig> except for the addition of ~ <dig> residues at the n-terminal . however, it is unlikely that this longer protein is actually expressed. first, protein domain analysis reveal the presence of a partial eukaryotic aspartic protease domain coded for by the extra n-terminal residues, but structural analysis suggests that the n-terminal half-domain would be unlikely to fold stably, since it lacks key components of the protein core. also, a blastn search against the collection of c. elegans ests failed to reveal a single sequence spanning the junction between the additional n-terminal region and the complete aspartic protease domain common to q88ne <dig> and q86ne <dig>  for h. contortus, q9u8g <dig> and q <dig> share 98% sequence identity and so are not likely to be true isoforms, but instead duplicated entries within uniprot. by contrast, h. contortus q <dig> and q70je <dig> share 50% amino-acid sequence identity, and so are likely to represent distinct, paralogous loci.

analysis of differential transcription of aspartic proteases by rtpcr analysis
transcription of seven aspartic protease genes across the life cycle of s. ratti was measured by rtpcr . figure  <dig> shows the relative expression of each gene between different life developmental stages. while transcription was observed for every gene in all stages, the expression of each transcript was variable between developmental stages. asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> were found to be the most constitutively transcribed in s. ratti. in c. elegans, asp- <dig> expression is lower in adults than in larvae whereas c. elegans asp- <dig> expression is relatively constitutive through development http://www.wormbase.org. s. ratti asp- <dig> transcription was markedly lower in the immature l <dig> and l <dig> stages than in il3s or in any of the three adult stages, which is a similar pattern to that seen for c. elegans asp- <dig>  <cit> . s. ratti asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> exhibited lower overall abundance than for the other s. ratti aspartic protease transcripts, and with levels somewhat elevated in the parasitic females  and the free living males . pronounced differences in transcription levels between developmental stages were observed for the two s. ratti asp- <dig> isoforms; with asp-2a levels highest in the parasitic females  and lowest in the free living adults , whereas asp-2b levels were lowest in paf when compared with flf and flm. by contrast, c. elegans asp- <dig> exhibits increasing expression from embryo through to adult  <cit> .

molecular modelling
a model of the asp-2a structure lacking the cys-rich insertion was readily obtained, no doubt helped by the small size of the insertions and deletions in asp-2a compared to the templates. using a multi-template approach three insertions of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> residues were modelled along with four small deletions of  <dig> or  <dig> residues . the model was stereochemically sound with no residues in ramachandran-disallowed areas and 91% of residues in core regions of the ramachandran plot. it had a dope score, an effective measure of protein structure quality in terms of residue contacts and solvent exposure, of - <dig>  this compares favourably with dope scores of - <dig> and - <dig> for the similarly sized main templates. support for the accuracy of the alignment used comes from the observation that cys residues  <dig> and  <dig>  neither of which aligned with cys residues in the templates, were found to be ideally positioned to form a novel disulphide bond .

the  <dig> residue cys-rich insertion is far beyond the size limit of around 10- <dig> residues up to which reasonably accurate loop modelling is considered possible. nevertheless, modelling was attempted using the predicted secondary structure  and predicted disulphide bonding pattern as additional constraints. unfortunately, there was no agreement between the results of the three disulphide bond predictors: each top prediction contained a different set of three predicted disulphide bonds. however, since the first three cys residues of the insertion were predicted to lie within a single helix followed immediately by the fourth cys residue, certain disulphides were rendered sterically impossible if the secondary structure prediction was assumed accurate. models were therefore made using the insertion disulphide connectivities of , , , the top prediction of dianna  <cit>  and , , , the top scoring result from the cysteine separation profile search algorithm at the precys server  <cit> . however, despite extensive efforts no model without obvious defects such as knots could be obtained so further analyses were applied to the model lacking this portion.

of the  <dig> modelled residues of asp-2a,  <dig> differ in asp-2b. mapping of these on to the asp- <dig> modelled structure  shows that they contain more solvent-exposed residues than buried ones so that the 3d structures of the two isoforms may be assumed to be very similar. the differing residues are well dispersed over the molecular surface but, importantly, only three positions are predicted to lie near to the substrate-binding cleft. these are met <dig>  thr <dig> and ile <dig> in 2a and are replaced by ile, gln and leu respectively in asp-2b. these are small to moderate differences in size and physicochemical characteristics, suggesting that substrate specificity will be very similar between the proteins

while analysing the differences between asp-2a and asp-2b, it was observed that among the  <dig> replacements resulting in charge differences there was a marked preference for positive residues in asp-2a to be replaced by neutral ones in asp-2b, or neutral positions in asp-2a to match negatively-charged residues in asp-2b. at these  <dig> positions asp-2a contains  <dig> positively charged residues and six negatively charged ones, compared to the figures for asp-2b of two and three, respectively. this results in a net charge difference on the protein as a whole of - <dig> in favour of asp-2b. electrostatic surface mapping of the asp-2a model shows that it, in common with other aspartic proteases including both templates  is strongly negatively charged, on both faces of the molecule but in particular at the substrate binding cleft. comparison with asp-2b  shows that the latter's additional negative charge is spread over several parts of the molecular surface. although we were unable to model the cys-rich insertion, sequence analysis shows that it follows a similar trend towards more negative charge on asp-2b vs asp-2a: of the three isoform sequence differences resulting in charge changes, two are from neutral  to negative  and the third from positive to neutral.

discussion
we found eight distinct asparatic protease genes transcribed by s. ratti. a key question is whether such diversity within the asparatic protease family has arisen recently, particularly within lineages leading to parasitic nematodes, or whether this diversity predated the evolution of the nematode phylum and has been preserved since. while based on a possibly incomplete sampling of s. ratti aspartic proteases and a possibly incomplete annotation of aspartic proteases in genome sequences, our phylogenetic analysis suggests three clusters of asparatic proteases. two of these  represent anciently derived aspartic proteases and includes asp- <dig>  asp- <dig> and asp- <dig> of c. elegans, corresponding orthologs for all three of these genes from s. ratti and additional orthologous genes in c. briggsae, brugia malayi, onchocerca volvulus, necator americanus, ancylostoma caninum, meloidogyne incognita and s. stercoralis. the remaining five s. ratti transcripts form a monophyletic group within cluster iii . the diversity among these five s. ratti transcripts has therefore arisen from a more recent set of duplication events than those present in clusters i and ii. similarly within cluster iii, independent duplication events in c. elegans and c. briggsae can be inferred, while aspartic proteases from the strongylids n. americanus and h. contortus also group together. thus, the evolution of aspartic proteases in cluster iii appears more dynamic than in clusters i and ii, involving the repeated duplication of asparatic proteases in different lineages.

two of the s. ratti transcripts within cluster iii, asp-2a and asp-2b, appear to have arisen from a relatively recent duplication, share 76% amino acid similarity to each other and exhibit a markedly different expression pattern . thus, asp-2a is predominantly found in parasitic females and asp-2b in free-living females, suggesting that these paralogs may have different functions in parasitic versus free-living females. we investigated the structure-function relationship of s. ratti asp-2a and asp-2b by homology modelling. since only three of the asp-2a/asp-2b sequence differences were located at the substrate binding cleft, and those were relatively conservative changes, it can be concluded that the substrate specificity of the isoforms is likely to be very similar. one possible explanation for the fixation of two copies of the gene with similar specificity may lie with the analysis of their electrostatic properties. although both are strongly negatively charged at neutral ph, sequence differences consistently led to extra negative change on isoform asp-2b. it is possible that these electrostatic differences reflect differences in the ph at which the two isoforms operate. most intestinal proteases from c. elegans exhibit optimal activity at ph  <dig>  suggesting that the c. elegans intestinal lumen is mildly acidic  <cit> , which is consistent with the negatively charged surface of s. ratti asp-2a and asp-2b. little is known about nematode digestion  <cit> , but it is possible that the ph of the intestinal lumen of s. ratti parasitic adults is less acidic than that of free-living adults, perhaps due to different requirements between digestion of microbiota by free-living stages versus host-derived nutrients by parasitic stages. accordingly, to maintain solubility and activity, the free living-specific isoform asp-2b, might have adjusted its pi downwards. it also remains possible that the two isoforms differ in their interaction with as-yet unidentified elements of their different environments, since inter-isoform differences are found throughout the surface of the protein .

notably, s. ratti asp-2a and asp-2b share a cysteine rich insertion with each other and with asp- <dig> of c. elegans , c. briggsae , q9n9h <dig> of n. americanus and q70je <dig> and q <dig> of h. contortus. these aspartic proteases from n. americanus and h. contortus have previously been implicated in parasitism, particularly the digestion of haemoglobin  <cit> . moreover, q <dig> of h. contortus is almost exclusively expressed by the blood-feeding stages  of haemonchus contortus, and is localised in the lumen of the gut of the adult parasite  <cit> . since s. ratti does not feed on blood, the role of asp-2a in s. ratti parasitic females remains unclear, but may involve the digestion of other host macromolecules. the cys-rich insertion, the similarity of which between enzymes illustrates a single evolutionary origin , shows a rather sporadic distribution in proteases from cluster iii and is also present in the group of q <dig>  a8x <dig> and a8xq <dig> which do not reliably fall within any of the three main clusters. importantly, different phylogenetic methods, including calculation of differences between sequences by both pair-wise and complete deletion methods, yield the same topology. the absence of the expected close relationship between proteases sharing this prominent sequence feature indicates that the insertion must have been present in the common ancestor of them all, but lost several times during evolution. the repeated loss of this prominent feature is itself concomitant with the repeated duplication of genes within cluster iii. this impression of ongoing genetic flux in the nematodes is in accord with previous analyses of other phenomena such as gene duplication and diversification  <cit> , gene movement between chromosomes  <cit>  and gene deletions and truncations  <cit> .

our results from s. ratti demonstrate that transcriptomic and genomic sequence data can be combined to identify distinct members of a gene family. such data are increasingly becoming available for other parasitic nematodes, particularly in light of concerted efforts by major sequencing centres and with the advent of new pyrosequencing techniques  <cit> . there will therefore soon be the opportunity to perform comparative evolutionary analyses and to examine the processes of gene gain and loss acting on large numbers of gene families across multiple nematode species. doing so will provide fresh insights into the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms associated with parasitism. however, such comparative evolutionary analyses will also bring considerable challenges. although we have used a number of bioinformatic methods to identify and align aspartic protease sequences, these methods have required manual supervision to construct reliable phylogenies. a more automated approach, suitable for analysis of multiple gene families, will still require validation by a manually supervised approach. our results also highlight the inherent difficulties in imposing a consistent nomenclature on duplicated members of gene families. ideally, one would wish the nomenclature to reflect the evolutionary relationships between the orthologs, perhaps by associating parasitic nematode genes to their corresponding c. elegans ortholog. however, as is the case for s. ratti aspartic proteases in cluster iii, gene duplications in lineages leading to parasitic nematodes generate paralogs and so confound a nomenclature based on orthology to a reference sequence genome. finally, the type of bioinformatic and evolutionary analyses that we present here can highlight genes, such as s. ratti asp-2a, which may have acquired a significant role during the evolution of parasitism. as such, these analyses help guide and inform - but are not a substitute for - more detailed molecular and biochemical work to examine in greater depth the novel functions acquired by such duplicated genes that aid a parasitic life-style.

CONCLUSIONS
s. ratti provides a powerful model to explore the genetic adaptations associated with the evolution of nematode parasitism due to the presence of both parasitic and free-living adults within its life-cycle. we have examined the role of gene duplication in adaptation to the parasitic lifestyle by analysis of genes from the aspartic protease family in strongyloides and identified a pair of paralogues differentially expressed in either the parasitic or the free-living phase of the nematode life-cycle, consistent with an important role for aspartic proteases in the evolution of nematode parasitism. while our findings should be tempered by the possible incompleteness of some databases and their annotation, we consider that gene duplication, accompanied by the acquisition of new function, is likely to be more widely applicable to understanding the evolutionary adaptations and biology of nematode parasites.
