BACKGROUND
gene expression is the mechanism through cells organize which genes can be up-regulated or repressed in response to both, changes in their environment  <cit>  or internal programs  <cit> . primary control of gene expression occurs through transcriptional regulation of mrna levels, where one or several transcription factor  proteins recognize and bind specific motifs in the dna, calling tf binding sites to modulate the activity of the basal transcriptional machinery  <cit> . in eukaryotes, the combination of tf binding sites clustered together near the transcription start sites in the promoter of genes are known as cis regulatory modules , and changes in the combination of tfs bound to their respective binding sites contribute to up or down-regulate gene expression levels  <cit> . the computational identification of functional tf binding sites or crms is challenging. in general, methods that scan genome sequences to identify matches with a consensus binding site or a position weight matrix  <cit>  produce high false positive rates owing to the low specificity of most of the profiles and the vast stretches of genomic sequences that have to be scanned. at the same time, prior knowledge has to be provided by the users to produce an unbiased genome survey of crms. new bioinformatics tools have been developed to avoid these problems in genome-wide predictions of mammalian cis regulatory regions. a novel method that involves binding affinity for tfs has been used to predict enhancers at the genomic scale  <cit> . another strategy for cis regulatory modules prediction has been used in the analysis of human and mouse genomes based on finding phylogenetically conserved binding sites for different tfs  <cit> . the increasing amount of information available from microarray experiments  <cit>  and tf binding sites  <cit>  requires the development of new tools to improve our understanding of gene expression and transcriptional regulation. based on the principle that co-expressed patterns emerge as the result of the combined action of tfs, several in silico methods have been used to elucidate the relationship between conserved motifs upstream of genes that are believed to be co-regulated  <cit> . these studies revealed that transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes works under a cooperative principle involving the binding sites for one or more tfs that are closely spaced in regulatory regions  <cit>  and for which the composition is non-randomly distributed in various gene promoters  <cit> . the information arising from this kind of data allows to better understand how gene expression changes in response to environmental or internal programs, thereby connecting tf binding sites information with signaling pathways such as the wnt pathway involved in many cellular processes.

the wnt pathway is implicated in numerous aspects of development  <cit> , cell differentiation  <cit> , and several diseases  <cit> ; notably, it was recently discovered a relation with cancer and neurodegenerative diseases like ad  <cit> . in the well-known wnt pathway -- the highly conserved canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway  <cit>  -- the secreted glycoprotein wnt interacts with frizzled, a seven-transmembrane receptor that transduces its signal through the activation of dishevelled, which in turn inactivates gsk-3β kinase that resides in a protein complex assembled by the scaffolding protein axin and adenomatous polyposis coli gene  product, a tumor suppressor. as a consequence of the gsk-3β inactivation, hypophosphorylated levels of cytosolic β-catenin increase, allowing it to bind to components of the high mobility group family of transcription factors t-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor , and this complex is then translocated to the nucleus where it activates gene expression  <cit> . in the absence of the wnt ligand, axin is stabilized and the interaction between apc and β-catenin is facilitated. in this complex, β-catenin is phosphorylated by gsk-3β and destined for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation; as a result, the expression of wnt signaling pathway target genes is repressed  <cit> .

several methods have been used to find new wnt signaling pathway target genes based on the interaction between β-catenin and the evolutionarily conserved tcf/lef, the most well known family of dna binding factors involved in gene regulation through wnt signaling:  reporter constructs based on tcf/lef binding sites  <cit> ,  serial analysis of chromatin occupancy   <cit>  and  combined microarrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation   <cit> . all of these methods have disadvantages: reporter constructs shows discrepancies and may not reveal the complexity of gene regulation  <cit> , and whole-genome saco and chip strongly depend on high quality antibodies and represent just a particular point in the interaction between tfs and regulatory regions. in particular, these methods have been used with colon cancer cell lines, a more complex background to study tcf/lef-dependent gene regulation, and predicted motifs for nf <dig>  hnf <dig> or ap- <dig>  among others, were discovered flanking tcf <dig> binding sites  <cit> . the method described by hallikas et al.  <cit>  was also used to identify targets for tcf <dig>  a well-characterized member of the tcf/lef family of tfs  <cit>  downstream of the wnt/β-catenin pathway, and suggested that hedgehog signaling is involved in the wnt pathway via gli transcription factor motifs found close to the tcf <dig> binding sites.

following the hypothesis that transcription factors work cooperatively to define gene expression, in this work we propose a multiple classification and regression tree  approach to identify new wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes within the human genome, based on the presence of transcription factor binding site motifs in their regulatory regions. the cart method has already been used to classify acetylated or methylated promoters based on the binding site composition of a set of differentially expressed genes  <cit>  or to identify relationships between gene expression levels and regulatory motifs in microarray experiments  <cit> . more directly, classification trees have been used to identify structural relationships between transcription factor binding sites and gene expression levels in order to discover regulatory motifs  <cit> . a similar approach was used to identify cis regulatory modules in differentially expressed genes of d. melanogaster germline  <cit> .

in this work we used the predicted tf binding site motifs for a group of  <dig>  genes in the human genome where  <dig> of them were known to be regulated by the wnt/β-catenin pathway  <cit>  to build a decision rule classifying genes as wnt/β-catenin pathway target candidates based on the occurrences of these tf binding site motifs in their upstream regions.

RESULTS
generation of candidate genes to be wnt/β-catenin pathway targets
we trained independently a series of  <dig>  cart trees using the information of the presence of transcription factor binding site motifs in the upstream region of  <dig>  genes of the human genome where  <dig> of them are known to be wnt/β-catenin pathway targets. we evaluated the  <dig>  genes in the  <dig>  cart trees and we ranked them using a "score" calculated as the number of times each one was classified as a wnt/β-catenin pathway target among the  <dig>  trees . finally, a "threshold" value for the scores was proposed defining a "decision rule" to classify whether a gene is a wnt/β-catenin pathway target. to define the score threshold we considered the highest percentile. besides the  <dig> known target genes, this threshold produced  <dig> new candidates . all previously known wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes were correctly classified.

interpretation of the relevant transcription factors in the cart method
to provide a biological interpretation of the results generated by the method we studied the importance of variables in the classification, i.e. the usage of tf binding site motifs in the upstream region of the gene, and therefore the associated tfs. we used a primary index, giving more importance to variables appearing near the root in most of the  <dig>  cart trees and a secondary index that just take the score or number of times that variables are used in the  <dig>  trees. in additional file  <dig> we provide a complete list of tf binding site motifs with the corresponding indexes and in table  <dig> we provide the tfs associated to some of the variables considered to be the most relevant according to both indexes and a biological criterion. finally both criteria revealed essentially similar results.

as expected, within the most relevant tfs used in the decision tree we found lef <dig> and tcf- <dig>  the complex formed between these regulator and β-catenin in upstream regions is necessary to regulate gene expression of canonical wnt signaling pathway targets. also, pax <dig> transcription factor has been detected in vitro as part of a complex formed by lef <dig> and repressor grg <dig> in melanocyte stem cells  <cit> . the proposed model indicates a turnover between pax <dig> and β-catenin for activation of dopachrome tautomerase gene  and the activation of a melanogenic cascade that leads to terminal differentiation of hair follicles. the presence of hnf4α transcriptional regulator as relevant for the predictor is also interesting. the study conducted by hatzis et al.  <cit>  revealed that binding sites motifs for this tf are present surrounding the specifically enriched tcf4-binding region identified by chip. in particular, benahmed et al.  <cit>  reported the cooperation between hnf4α, β-catenin and tcf- <dig> to regulate the expression pattern of the homeobox cdx <dig> in mouse gut development. recently it has been suggested that hnf4α could mediate gene expression of several drug transporter proteins in human and rat choroid-plexus  <cit> . also recently, it has been demonstrated that transcriptional regulator gr  is involved in down-regulation of cyclin d <dig> by targeting the tcf/β-catenin complex  <cit> ; furthermore, it has been reported gr and β-catenin as part of the same immunocomplex in regulatory regions for cyclin d <dig> in human osteoblastic cells  <cit> . regulatory sites for maz  have been reported upstream of matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, the mt1-mmp gene is up-regulated in colon carcinomas mediated by a direct interaction of β-catenin/tcf <dig> complex and their 5' flanking region, indicating that it is a direct target of wnt pathway.

in summary, besides the presence of lef1/tcf <dig> complex, some of the most relevant transcriptional regulators used by the predictor have been previously described to be associated to the regulatory regions of genes that also respond to wnt canonical pathway, suggesting that changes in gene expression of the new wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes can involve other factors acting on promoter regions of these genes.

gene ontology analysis of new wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes
classical targets of the wnt signaling pathway have been related to different biological processes ranging from development to diseases  <cit> , and these targets mediate wnt function in diverse cell types and tissues. in order to know in which processes our predicted targets are involved, we used ontologizer software  <cit>  to assign gene ontology  terms to the  <dig> known and the  <dig> proposed wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes, and also some other highly ranked genes in the boundary of the threshold score. we used go-slim annotation  <cit> , a subset of go terms, to avoid the large number of go terms and get a general comparison of the annotations. this annotation was also used to obtain a general view of which ontology terms were represented in both sets of data  <cit> . the number of genes in each category was calculated considering the parent-child union relationship to avoid over representation of terms in each dataset, caused by the direct acyclic graph nature of go terms. we found that the candidates to be wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes present a similar distribution under the three ontology categories . only one biological process categories  was not present in the proposed wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes . on the other hand, under the molecular function ontology six categories  were present only in the proposed wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes . the complete list of terms using full go annotation can be found in the supplementary material files . for biological process ontology, we detected an enrichment of some categories in the training set  compared against the terms for the complete human genome dataset used in cart procedure . none of them was significantly enriched in the new candidates group, even when in some cases the number of terms was similar like in each case. to explore in which tissue or cell type our new proposed target genes are expressed, we used gene expression data from two different human microarray platforms, gnf1h and u <dig> affymetrix chips information obtained from biogps   <cit> . when data was clustered  to produce similar profiles, we found a group of genes in the same cluster . this group represents the gene expression data from  <dig> cerebral tissues in one platform  and  <dig> cerebral tissues in the other one . because the wnt signaling pathway is present in several biological processes, these expression profiles led us to consider in which processes our wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes could be represented.

to obtain more information regarding the bests ranked genes represented in these clusters, we selected a subgroup of genes activated in the two databases . one of the new proposed targets, tropomyosin alpha, is involved in the contractile system of striated and smooth muscles and in non-muscle cells, and tropomyosin forms an integral part of the cytoskeleton and is involved in the regulation of cellular contraction  <cit> . in particular, tropomyosin is associated with neurofibrillary pathology of ad  <cit> . within this cluster, we identified other interesting genes that could be involved in neuroprotection against aβ toxicity. calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase iv  gene is up-regulated in response to both wnt ligands and lithium  <cit>  to promote neuronal survival. another candidate we identified was synapsin  <dig> . synapsin is an abundant synaptic vesicle protein that belongs to a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins that are highly concentrated in pre-synaptic nerve terminals. synapsin is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles, playing a key role in neurotransmitter release and in the formation and maintenance of synaptic contacts among central neurons  <cit> . synapsin ii co-precipitates with fibrillar aβ, and there is a regional loss of synapsin i in the hippocampus of patients with late-stage ad  <cit> , suggesting that the regional decrease in synapsin is associated with cytoskeletal changes as well as with aβ deposits  <cit> . interestingly, ryk  gene was also found as a putative wnt target gene. ryk functions as a co-receptor with frizzled for wnt ligands through the activation of a β-catenin-independent signaling pathway  <cit> . in fact, ryk is able to bind to dishevelled, thereby activating the canonical wnt pathway. ryk function is related to axon guidance and neurite outgrowth, making it an interesting target for wnt activation  <cit> .

among the new target genes, we also found a member of the phosphatidylinositol phosphatases, synaptojanin  <dig> . a spliced form of the mrna from this gene partially overlaps the function of synaptojanin  <dig>  in nerve terminals, with additional roles in neurons and other cells  <cit> . from the ad perspective, haploinsufficiency of synj <dig> exerts its protective effect on oligomers aβ-mediated down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol  diphosphate phosphatase  <dig> and impairment of synaptic function  <cit> . in fact, other genes involved in inositol metabolism, phosphatidylinositol  bisphosphate 5-phosphatase a , or in phosphatidylinositol signaling, as inositol  <dig> ,4-triphosphate 5/ <dig> kinase  and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3γ , were identified by our method, which is consistent with the potential connection between ad and phosphoinositides  <cit> .

another interesting wnt-regulated gene candidate is the inhibitory subunit for protein phosphatase  <dig> , a dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein also known as darpp- <dig>  <cit> . through its inhibition of protein phosphatase  <dig>  darpp- <dig> controls the state of phosphorylation and the activities of several key proteins, including ion channels, ion pumps, neurotransmitter receptors, and transcription factors; thus, darpp- <dig> controls the physiological characteristics of neurons containing dopamine receptors  <cit> . interestingly, inhibition of protein phosphatase  <dig> strongly stimulates soluble amyloid precursor protein  secretion and inhibits aβ formation  <cit> ; therefore, wnt-dependent up-regulation of darpp- <dig> provides a potential route for the prevention of ad.

another new target is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein r. products of these families of genes play important roles in regulating neural-specific pre-mrna splicing, thereby contributing to the regulation of neural function and development  <cit> . therefore, their neuron-specific regulation and function reveals new insights into physiological and pathological events. ectodermal-neural cortex  <dig> , which is a component of the tcf/β-catenin complex, is another new target that is up-regulated in colorectal carcinomas  <cit> . interestingly, enc- <dig> is a nuclear matrix protein abundantly expressed in the brain and appears to be localized in primary neurons and is up-regulated in brain tumors, suggesting that it might be involved in brain tumorigenesis  <cit> . these results suggest that the wnt pathway can transcriptionally modulate a neuroprotective response against aβ peptide, promoting neuronal survival and rescuing changes in activation or sub-cellular localization of wnt components  <cit> .

biological validation
to test whether new targets of the wnt/β-catenin pathway predicted by our method change their expression depending of pathway activation we used rt-qpcr  <cit> . we measured changes in mrna levels between hek- <dig> that over-express and secrete wnt ligands and hek- <dig> wild-type cells. table  <dig> shows expression fold-change for seven genes assigned to class  <dig> by the method and covering a wide range of scores, and  <dig> genes not selected as wnt/β-catenin pathway targets by the method. two of them appear in the first 2% of the highest scores and two are controls with very low scores. we observe that five of the nine genes analyzed, having different scores in our method, exhibited significant changes in gene expression. among them, a link between ad and phosphoinositides has been previously mentioned for iptk <dig> and pik3r <dig>  also, we found significant differences in the expression of adrenomedullin , a peptide involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes  <cit> . in particular, adm prevents damage caused by oxidative stress through the phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase-dependent pathway, and it was recently  <cit>  reported that lack of adm in mouse brain results in behavioral changes. on the other hand, high levels of adm in plasma have been found in patients with chronic schizophrenia  <cit> , which confirms its role in brain disorders. two other new target genes that also change their expression levels are involved in neuronal and brain development. the first one, crkl, is part of the reelin pathway, which is necessary for embryonic development of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus  <cit> . in particular, crkl is required for dendritogenesis but not for axonogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons cells  <cit> . mice lacking expression of a crkl ortholog exhibits several defects in cardiac and neural crest formation during early stages of development. crkl exerts its function as a scaffold protein interacting with phosphorylated tyrosine domains of dab- <dig> effector protein. the last gene is neurogenin  <dig>  that is involved in gliogenesis during the development of the central nervous system  <cit> . in particular, over-expression of neurog <dig> changes the morphology of dendrites in hippocampal neurons through reduction of synaptic contacts  <cit> .

*p-value <  <dig> , ¥ involved in brain development or abnormalities .

results from rt-qpcr revealed that, at different scores , the assignment of cart procedure identified several new targets for the wnt/β-catenin pathway that exhibit changes in their expression levels in response to wnt ligand.

discussion
the majority of known genes regulated through the wnt and tcf/β-catenin pathways are important in developmental and differentiation mechanisms in complex organisms. the training set selected for the proposed multiple cart strategy is based on this information, and gene ontology analysis revealed that this group of genes is enriched in categories like multicellular organismal processes, which involve go terms like cell differentiation, embryonic development and anatomical structural development with respect to the whole-genome ontology information. the genes selected by our method have a similar distribution of ontology terms but no enrichment was found. the fact that both groups of genes can be distributed in the same ontologies, lead us to argue that the loss of enrichment is more related with the change in the number of genes analyzed than the genes in the group of candidates themselves. indeed, the benjamini-hochberg method for multiple testing corrections uses the length of the data to adjust the p-value. clustering of gene expression results revealed that our predicted new wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes in brain tissues have expression profiles similar to those of colorectal cancer cell lines, which have high levels of accumulated β-catenin. this similarity suggests a conserved mechanism to regulate the expression of these genes, based in β-catenin and tcf/lef interactions. our rt-qpcr results indicated that some of the new wnt/β-catenin pathway targets assigned using the multiple cart method change their expression levels when wnt/β-catenin ligands are over-expressed. the physiological role for some of these new targets revealed that these genes are particularly involved in brain pathologies. we also associated the database from hatzis et al.  <cit>   with our predicted new candidates involved in the wnt/β-catenin pathway and we found that  <dig> genes from our list had been detected in a chip-coupled dna microarray. tnfrs <dig> is an example of a gene that did not change its expression level in the presence of exogenous wnt expression; however, this gene has been reported as wnt target by chip with colorectal cancer cell lines and tcf <dig> antibodies  <cit> . remarkably, tnfrsf <dig> receptor gene, also known as death receptor  <dig> , is widely expressed in neurons and regulates axon pruning and neuronal death  <cit> . in addition to the role dr <dig> plays in neuronal development, app was also identified as a ligand for this receptor, and their interaction activates a caspase-dependent self-destruction program, suggesting that extracellular fragments of app may contribute to ad  <cit> .

other genes assigned as wnt/β-catenin pathway targets by the proposed method may be involved in brain or nervous systems abnormalities other than ad. for example, elongation factor  <dig> alpha  <dig>  corresponds to an isoform belonging to the elongation factor family complex. this isoform has been predominantly detected in brain, heart and muscle tissues  <cit>  and has been implicated as an oncogene in ovarian and breast tumors  <cit> . a spontaneous autosomal recessive mutation in eef1a <dig> is responsible for the waste phenotype in mouse, which, among others effects, shows abnormalities in the spinal cord and brain stem and leads to severe motor neuron degeneration  <cit> . finally, the oncogene pim <dig>  which is dysregulated in acute leukemia  <cit> , has recently been shown to be up-regulated in a microarray screen using post-mortem brain-derived microglia  <cit> . the expression level of eef1a <dig> and pim <dig> did not change in our rt-qpcr measurements, suggesting that another condition or synergistic signaling pathway is required to regulate their expression in response to wnt ligands. in this direction, the fact that some of the relevant transcription factors used by the proposed method have been described acting together with β-catenin supports the idea that other regulators besides lef <dig> can control gene expression. more interesting, the presence of nuclear receptors as gr and hnf4α suggests a crosstalk between hormone regulation and wnt/β-catenin pathway to control gene expression in brain.

a more detailed analysis of each one of these wnt/β-catenin target genes is required to prove in vivo whether their change in gene expression levels is a direct response to wnt pathway activation or corresponds to more complex signaling networks that operate in brain tissues. however, to our knowledge, this study represents the first approach to use cis regulatory module information and a cart strategy to propose a global analysis to detect new genes involved in brain diseases and ad.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a method to identify new wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes based on the analysis of the number of times that each of  <dig> selected transcription factors binding site motifs appear in the promoter region of the genes  in the human genome. we developed a strategy based on the use of the cart method to detect genes in which the presence of tf binding site motifs is similar to the one in the known targets of the wnt/β-catenin pathway.

through the classification method, we proposed  <dig> new candidates in which transcriptional regulation could be controlled under the canonical wnt/β-catenin pathway. the tissue-specific expression profiles of these genes revealed a common pattern between brain tissues and, notably, are similar to colorectal carcinoma profiles, where increased levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin are responsible for activating expression of several groups of genes  <cit> . in agreement with these results, several of the new candidates bind to lef <dig>  and it is well established that tcf/lef <dig> forms a complex with β-catenin to activate the expression of genes under the canonical wnt pathway  <cit> .

the wnt pathway potentially promotes neuronal survival and rescues deficiencies resulting from alterations in the expression of wnt components  <cit> . among the new candidates, we found several genes that could be regulated through the canonical wnt/β-catenin pathway, and their function is to regulate neuronal physiology and brain tumorigenesis, to decrease the levels of aβ fibrils and to promote soluble app forms. further analysis is required to demonstrate a direct interaction between tcf/lef <dig> transcription factors with the promoter regions of these genes in response to the activated wnt/β-catenin, but the predictions made by the proposed cart method revealed a strong connection between the canonical wnt pathway and the cooperative control of gene transcription in brain physiology and neuropathology, in particular ad.
