BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most important nosocomial pathogens, which colonizes patients with trauma or a breach by tracheostomy, catheters, surgery, or severe burns. it is also the major cause of chronic lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis  <cit> . treatment of infections caused by p. aeruginosa has become more challenging because of its resistance to many antimicrobial agents  <cit> . carbapenems  remain the principal antimicrobial agents for treatment of serious infections, such as nosocomial pneumonia, serious nosocomial intra-abdominal infection and septicemia caused by p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

extensive use of carbapenems has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa , and the increasing incidence of resistance to carbapenems in p. aeruginosa has become a global issue . surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility by the european centre for disease prevention and control reported that the average rate of resistance of p. aeruginosa against carbapenems was  <dig>  %  <cit> .

the acquisition of carbapenem-hydrolyzing β-lactamases , overexpression of chromosome-encoded ampc β-lactamase, extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinases , reduction of permeability of the outer membrane protein oprd, and overexpression of the major resistance-nodulation-division  efflux pump systems , are all involved in carbapenem resistance in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . most ampc-type β-lactamases naturally produced by gram-negative organisms hydrolyse amino- and ureido-penicillins, cephamycins  and, to a lesser extent, oxyimino-cephalosporins  and monobactams  <cit> . in contrast, esacs confer reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins and carbapenems  <cit> .

the present study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of bloodstream isolated imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa  collected between  <dig> and  <dig>  our findings demonstrated that the prevalence of imipenem resistance in bacteremic p. aeruginosa remains low  in taiwan. mutations in oprd and production of an active efflux pump are the major causes of imipenem resistance in p. aeruginosa, followed by overproduction of ampc β-lactamase, esacs, and the acquisition of vim and oxa.

methods
sampling and isolation of p. aeruginosa
bacteremic p. aeruginosa isolates were recovered in two taiwanese university hospitals, january  <dig> to february  <dig>  the ethics committee of national cheng kung university hospital  approved that no formal ethical approval was needed to use these clinically obtained materials, because the strains were remnant from patient samples, and the data were analyzed anonymously. p. aeruginosa was identified in clinical laboratory by colony morphology, gram stain, biochemical tests, and the vitek system  according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. susceptibility to imipenem for p. aeruginosa isolates was determined by the disk diffusion method  on mueller-hinton  agar based on the clsi guidelines  <cit> . a total of  <dig> bacteremic imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates were selected for further analysis.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
minimal inhibitory concentrations  of amikacin , aztreonam , cefepime , ceftazidime , ciprofloxacin , doripenem , gentamicin , imipenem , levofloxacin , and meropenem  were determined in duplicate by the agar dilution method according to the recommendations of the clsi  <cit> . p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> was used as the quality control strain. the interpretation of resistance to these antimicrobial agents was determined according to the recommendations of the clsi  <cit> . multidrug resistant  p. aeruginosa was defined as isolates that were resistant to at least  <dig> classes of the tested antimicrobial agents  <cit> .

pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
pfge of spei-digested genomic dna samples of p. aeruginosa isolates was carried out with a chef mapper xa apparatus  according to the instruction manual. electrophoresis was performed for 24 h at 14 °c with pulse time ranging from  <dig> to 35 s at 6 v/cm  <cit> . pfge profiles were analyzed and compared using the gelcompar ii software, version  <dig>  .

β-lactamase characterization
β-lactamase genes  were detected by pcr . the purified pcr products were directly sequenced using an automated abi prism  <dig> dna sequencer . the dna sequences and deduced amino acid sequences were compared with genes in the genbank database  or the β-lactamase classification system  to confirm the subtypes of β-lactamase genes.

ampc overproduction was investigated using cloxacillin -containing plates, since cloxacillin inhibits ampc β-lactamase activity and thus restores susceptibility to ceftazidime  <cit> . e. cloacae atcc  <dig>  which contained ampc class c β-lactamase, and atcc  <dig> were used as positive and negative control strains, respectively  <cit> . esacs β-lactamases properties were determined by using cloxacillin-containing plates with or without adding imipenem  <cit> . an isolate was defined as an ampc overproducer or having esacs phenotype when there was at least a twofold dilution difference between the mic of ceftazidime/ceftazidime plus cloxacillin and the mic of imipenem/imipenem plus cloxacillin, respectively. in addition, pcr amplification of ampc-type genes was performed as previously described  <cit> . the purified pcr products were directly sequenced using an automated abi prism  <dig> dna sequencer . ampc sequences were compared with that of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> strain .

detection of efflux pump activity
to investigate the activity of efflux pumps in irpa isolates, mics of meropenem in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors phe-arg β-naphthylamide dihydrochloride   or carbonyl-cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone   were determined  <cit> . paβn at 50 μg/ml or  <dig>  μm cccp was incorporated in mh agar, and meropenem susceptibility testing was performed in parallel on agar plates with or without an efflux pump inhibitor. p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> was used as the control strain.

analysis of efflux pump genes expression
overnight cultured bacteria were diluted 1: <dig> in mh broth and grown to the late log phase of growth . total rna was extracted using the acid phenol/chloroform method and treated with rnase-free dnase i  and rnasin , according to a previous study  <cit> . rt-qpcr was performed and the expression of the housekeeping proc gene was used as the internal control for relative quantification  <cit> . oligonucleotide primers to examine the gene expression of mexa, mexc, mexe, mexx, and proc were described previously  <cit> . isolates were considered to be mexab-oprm, mexcd-oprj, mexef-oprn, and mexxy-oprm hyperproducers when the levels of expression of mexa, mexc, mexe, and mexx were at least fivefold higher than that of the reference strain p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  respectively.

examination of oprd mutations
the oprd gene of p. aeruginosa was amplified by pcr, and the primers used were described previously  <cit> . oprd sequences were compared with that of the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> strain. insertion sequences  were further identified using the is finder database   <cit> .

RESULTS

genotyping of β-lactamases revealed that vim- <dig>  vim- <dig>  oxa- <dig>  and oxa- <dig> β-lactamases were identified in  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  isolates, respectively. all vim- and oxa-carrying strains were classified as mdr-p. aeruginosa . ampc overproduction and esacs were shown in  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the  <dig> irpa isolates, respectively . the ampc amino acid sequences of  <dig> esacs producers showed  <dig> variants from the ampc sequence of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the most frequent variant was pdc- <dig> , which contained a t105a substitution, compared to the ampc of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>   <cit> . the pdc- <dig>  and pdc- <dig>  variants had the g27d, a97v, t105a, and v205l; and r79q and t105a substitutions, respectively. only  <dig> isolates  showed the identical pao <dig> sequence of ampc. the remaining  <dig> isolates contained substitutions of ampc described as follows: isolate  <dig>  g27d, t105a, a156t, v205l, and v356i; isolate  <dig>  r79q, t105a, v205l, and v356i; isolate  <dig>  t21a, t105a, and v205l; isolate  <dig>  r79q, t105a, and v205l; and isolate  <dig>  g27d, t105a, and v <dig> 

efflux pump activity
a greater than or equal to fourfold decrease in mic of meropenem when tested in combination with either efflux pump inhibitor, paβn or cccp, was shown in  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the irpa isolates, respectively. this indicates that an active efflux pump contributes to the imipenem resistance of p. aeruginosa isolates. moreover, paβn was effective in changing the isolate categorization from meropenem resistant  to susceptible  in  <dig> isolates . overexpression of rnd efflux pump genes mexa, mexc, mexe, and mexx were further determined among  <dig> selected isolates with greater than or equal to a fourfold concentration decrease in mic  for meropenem in combination with paβn. among them, no overexpression of mexa was detected, and only  <dig>  of the isolates expressed mexc and mexe at least fivefold higher than that of the control strain pao <dig>  eighteen  isolates overexpressed mexx at least tenfold higher than that of pao <dig>  nine  of the  <dig> isolates that did not overexpress any of the major rnd efflux pumps were further tested for the susceptibility to 50 μg/ml of paβn, and the results showed  <dig> isolate  was susceptible to paβn. however, the remaining  <dig> isolates possibly contained the additional paβn-sensitive efflux pump that reduces the imipenem susceptibility.

a shortened putative loop l <dig> of oprd was found in  <dig> isolates   . additive amino acid substitutions of oprd were found in all these  <dig> irpa. in addition, isolates  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained identical  <dig> amino acid substitutions and a shortened loop l <dig> of oprd. isolate  <dig>  with a shortened loop l <dig> alone, showed lower mics of meropenem  and doripenem ; the remaining  <dig> isolates had a shortened loop l <dig> in combination with ampc and esac overproduction or active efflux overexpression and showed higher mics of meropenem  and doripenem  . the amino acid variation of isolate  <dig> contributed to its low level resistance to imipenem .

the sequencing results showed that  <dig> is elements, including ispa <dig> , ispa <dig> , is <dig> , ispa <dig> , isppu <dig> , and isazo <dig> , were identified in  <dig> irpa isolates, and thus lead to a disruption of the coding sequence of oprd . among these is elements, ispa <dig>  ispa <dig>  and is <dig>  were classified as is family is <dig>  is <dig>  and is <dig>  respectively. ispa <dig>  isppu <dig>  and isazo <dig> were classified as is <dig> transposase family. no novel is element was found in our irpa isolates.

discussion
in the present study, we showed the prevalence of imipenem resistance in bacteremic p. aeruginosa is  <dig>  % during a 10-year longitudinal surveillance in taiwan. mutations in oprd and an active efflux pump are the major causes of imipenem resistance, followed by overproduction of ampc β-lactamase, esacs phenotype, and the acquisition of vim- and oxa-β-lactamases in p. aeruginosa.

surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility by the smart  <dig> reported that the susceptibility to imipenem of p. aeruginosa from intra-abdominal infections was 69 % worldwide  <cit> . another global multicenter surveillance study, tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial , showed that the imipenem resistance rate of blood isolates of p. aeruginosa collected from  <dig> until august  <dig> was  <dig>  %  <cit> . recently, carbapenem resistance of invasive p. aeruginosa has rising to  <dig>  %, which was reported from the european centre for disease prevention and control  <dig>  <cit> . lin et al. showed the overall prevalence of crpa was  <dig>  % in taiwan, and there was a significant trend of increasing crpa prevalence during the period 2000- <dig>  <cit> . however, our results showed lower prevalence  of bacteremic crpa isolates in taiwan. moreover, the entire collection was highly susceptible to amikacin  and no colistin resistant irpa isolate was found. as a result, amikacin and colistin can serve as treatment agents against bacteremic irpa in taiwan. however, carbapenem susceptibility of invasive p. aeruginosa infections needs to be continually monitored to control the prevalence of crpa.

the active efflux pumps in p. aeruginosa belonging to the rnd family, which contributes to multidrug resistance by extruding the antimicrobial agents outside the bacterial cells  <cit> . overexpression of the rnd efflux pump systems mexab-oprm, mexcd-oprj, mexef-oprn, and mexxy-oprm confer resistance to carbapenem in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . in this study, the mexa is constitutively expressed in all of the tested isolates with active efflux, and no difference among imipenem resistant isolates was found, compared with p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  this indicates that mexa contributes a limited role to imipenem resistance in our isolates. the mexc, mexe, and mexx are expressed at a low level in late log phase in pao <dig>  but their expression is more than fivefold up-regulated in  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  of  <dig> selected resistant strains, respectively. therefore, our data demonstrated the importance of efflux pump systems in the imipenem resistance of p. aeruginosa. however,  <dig> isolates which possibly contained unknown paβn-sensitive efflux pumps that reduce imipenem susceptibility remained to be investigated.

the outer membrane protein oprd, a carbapenem-specific porin, contributed to imipenem resistance and reduced susceptibility to meropenem in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . mutations of oprd prevalent in our isolates revealed that loss or reduced oprd confers resistance to carbapenem in p. aeruginosa . a shortened putative loop l <dig> of the oprd porin was identified in carbapenem-resistant isolates, and this shortening may open the porin channel to allow optimal penetration of meropenem and increase the meropenem susceptibility profile in imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa  <cit> . we also found a shortened loop l <dig> of the oprd in  <dig> irpa isolates, and strain  <dig>  with only a shortened loop l <dig>  showed lower mics of meropenem  and doripenem , compared with strains had shortened loop l <dig> and the presence of ampc and esac overproduction or active efflux . a lower mic of doripenem in strains with a shortened loop l <dig> of oprd was also observed . this raises the possibility that a shortened loop l <dig> of the oprd porin is responsible for the unusual meropenem and doripenem hypersusceptibility. moreover, riera et al. showed that while the inactivation of the porin oprd caused high-level resistance to imipenem , it produced only moderate resistance to meropenem  <cit> , and these results are observed in this study .

yan et al. have reported the presence of unusual bla-encoding integrons of vim- <dig>  vim- <dig>  oxa- <dig>  and oxa- <dig> in multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates in taiwan  <cit> . in the present study, all  <dig> vim- and oxa-carrying isolates belonged to mdr p. aeruginosa. although the imipenem resistance mechanisms in our isolates are diverse, isolates harboring vim- and oxa-type β-lactamases showed higher carbapenem mics, especially imipenem  . this reflects that carbapenem can be efficiently hydrolyzed by the vim- and oxa-type β-lactamases  <cit> .

increased production of the ampc chromosome-encoded cephalosporinase and esacs production contributed to carbapenem resistance in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . in this study, we used the ampc inhibitor cloxacillin to demonstrate that ampc overproduction and esac were shown in  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the irpa strains, respectively. the prevalence of the ampc and esac phenotypes in our isolates was lower than the reported by rodríguez-martínez et al.   <cit> , and we revealed that overproduction of ampc and esac play an additive role in reduced susceptibility to carbapenem in our resistant strains. moreover,  <dig>  %  of ampc or esac overproducers were mdr strains, indicating that overexpression of ampc and esac is an important issue for antibiotic resistance in p. aeruginosa. thirteen out of  <dig> isolates contained an ampc β-lactamase variant, with all variants possessing an alanine residue at position  <dig>  this residue had been previously shown to be the key factor for an esac phenotype  <cit> . however,  <dig> isolates  were esac producers containing the identical pao <dig>  sequence of ampc. as a result, the mechanism leading to the easc property in these two isolates remained to be clarified.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, imipenem resistance in bacteremic p. aeruginosa collected between january  <dig> and february  <dig> remained low  in taiwan. mutations of oprd and active efflux are the major causes of imipenem resistance. overproduction of ampc β-lactamase, esac, and acquisition of vim and oxa are also involved in imipenem resistance of p. aeruginosa. since  <dig>  % of imipenem-resistant isolates were found to be mdr strains, usage of carbapenems should be controlled to prevent pan-drug resistant p. aeruginosa occurrence.
