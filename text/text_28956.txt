BACKGROUND
candida parapsilosis is an emerging human pathogen that is currently the second or third most commonly isolated candida species from blood cultures worldwide  <cit> . c. parapsilosis typically is a commensal of human skin and is considered to be of low pathogenicity in the setting of intact host barriers. the species is notorious for its capacity to form biofilms on catheters and other implanted devices, for nosocomial spread by hand carriage, and for persistence in the hospital environment  <cit> . c. parapsilosis is of special concern in critically ill neonates, causing more than one quarter of all invasive fungal infections in low birth weight infants in the uk  <cit>  and north america  <cit> , and it is a leading cause of neonatal mortality. in low-birth weight neonates, mortality rates are similar between infants with invasive disease due to c. parapsilosis and c. albicans,  <dig> vs. 42%, respectively  <cit> . hence, detailed knowledge of c. parapsilosis interaction with the host has become urgent. however, host immunity to c. parapsilosis infections represents an important, yet understudied area.

recognition and innate immune response against candida spp. is effected by both professional   <cit>  as well as semi-professional   <cit>  immune cells. the most potent phagocytic cells of the immune system are neutrophils and macrophages, and they are also considered as the prototypical phagocytic cells of pathogenic candida  <cit> . however, the strategic location of antigen-presenting dendritic cells  at epithelial surfaces and in the skin, the primary sites of c. parapsilosis occurrence, places dcs in the first line of defense against invading yeast cells. it has recently been shown that c. parapsilosis induces dc fungipod formation  <cit> , which is associated with immune recognition. importantly the fungipod response is species specific, since the related fungal pathogens c. tropicalis and c. albicans induce very few and no fungipods, respectively, suggesting significant differences between the response of dcs to different pathogenic candida species.  <cit> . at present, the role of dcs in c. parapsilosis pathogenesis, such as the induction of cytokine gene and protein expression, phagocytosis or fungicidal activity by dcs, is poorly understood.

although the clinical importance of c. parapsilosis is growing, little is known about its virulence factors. secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes can facilitate disease and lipases have been associated with c. parapsilosis virulence  <cit> , however the exact role of this enzyme is still unknown. putative roles for lipases include the digestion of lipids for nutrient acquisition, adhesion to host cells, synergistic interactions with other enzymes, unspecific hydrolysis, initiation of inflammatory processes by affecting immune cells, and self-defense by lysing the competing microflora. we previously showed that c. parapsilosis secreted lipase impacted the capacity of the fungus to grow in lipid rich medium, to produce biofilm, and to survive in macrophages. the production of lipase was essential for c. parapsilosis to attach, invade and damage reconstituted oral epithelium, and to invade host tissues in a murine infection model  <cit> . concomitantly, we have evaluated the role of lip <dig>  a key lipase in c. albicans, and recapitulated our findings that lipases can be important virulence factors in candida  <cit> .

the aim of our current study is to determine the in vitro interaction of human monocyte-derived dcs with wild type and lipase deficient c. parapsilosis cells. because immature and mature dcs , show selective responsiveness to different immune and cytokine stimuli we used both cell types in our test system. we have determined that both dc types exert phagocytic and fungicidal activities and produce t-helper   <dig> type cytokines in response to c. parapsilosis. furthermore we analyzed the role of c. parapsilosis lipase by using a lipase deficient mutant and compared the phagocytic capacity and proinflammatory protein production of both dc types.

RESULTS
human monocyte derived dendritic cells internalize lipase deficient mutant yeast cells more efficiently
although human dcs can phagocytose and eliminate c. albicans cells  <cit> , there is little information regarding the outcome of the interactions between dcs and c. parapsilosis cells. therefore, we examined the ability of human monocyte-derived dcs to phagocytose c. parapsilosis. for this, idcs and mdcs were incubated in suspension with unopsonized fitc-labeled live c. parapsilosis cells for various periods of time, and phagocytosis was quantified as described in materials and methods.

idcs and mdcs efficiently kill c. parapsilosis yeast cells
to assess whether phagocytosis of c. parapsilosis cells results in the activation of the antifungal effector machinery in idcs and mdcs, we performed killing assays using dc co-cultures with c. parapsilosis wild type and lipase deficient yeast. the results  showed that both idcs and mdcs were able to efficiently kill c. parapsilosis by  <dig> h post-infection. idcs and mdcs killed 12% and  <dig> % of wild type c. parapsilosis yeast cells, respectively. furthermore, we found that 23% and  <dig> % of lipase deficient yeast cells were killed by idcs and mdcs, respectively, which was significantly higher compared to that of the wild type c. parapsilosis .

in another series of experiments, we have monitored the viability of dcs after infection with c. parapsilosis by measuring the protease activity of the co-cultures. strikingly, we have found significantly increased number of dead dcs following infection with lipase deficient yeasts compared to uninfected dcs. increased numbers of dead dcs were present as early as  <dig> h post-lipase deficient infection  with only ~10% of dcs remaining viable  <dig> h post-infection . in contrast, dcs infected with wild type yeast cells showed decreased protease activity after  <dig> h of co-incubation  with ~50% of dcs still viable at  <dig> h post-infection. we have obtained similar results when using trypan blue labeling .

numerous species of the candida genus form pseudohyphae as an effort to avoid killing by phagocytic cells. our data demonstrate that dcs less efficiently kill lipase deficient compared to wild type c. parapsilosis and suggest that wild type yeast cells, at least partially, escape dc immune response. a possible escape mechanism could be pseudohyphae formation. we have monitored the pseudohyphae formation of c. parapsilosis in dc-fungi co-culture and determined that c. parapsilosis does not form pseudohyphae in our model .

another mechanism by which pathogens modify the immune response of the host is altering lysosome maturation. in order to test if c. parapsilosis lipase decreases the phago-lysosome maturation, we have performed labeling with lysotracker red, a weakly basic amine that selectively accumulates in acidic compartments such as lysosome. we have observed lysosome maturation in both dc types after infection with wild type and lipase deficient yeast cells , but there was a decreased number of mature lysosomes in both idcs and mdcs infected with wild type yeast .

production of il-1α, il- <dig>  tnfα, and cxcl <dig> by idcs and mdcs exposed to wild type or lipase deficient c. parapsilosis
the outcome of encounters between antigen-bearing apcs and naive t cells depends, in part, on the nature of the proinflammatory proteins released locally by the apcs. proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as il-1α, il- <dig>  tnfα, and cxcl <dig>  secreted by various cell types play a fundamental role in attracting neutrophils and t cells to the place of skin infection. therefore, we determined the pattern of the production of the above mentioned four molecules in dcs exposed to wild type or lipase deficient c. parapsilosis by monitoring gene expression and protein secretion using qualitative real-time -pcr, cytokine-specific elisas, and luminex fluorokine multianalyte profiling  assays.

for gene expression studies, cells were harvested at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection in order to monitor the early and late effects of the infection, respectively. qrt-pcr results revealed that the expression of nearly all of the four proinflammatory genes was significantly higher upon infection with c. parapsilosis cells in comparison to the non-stimulated dc populations , while the expression of tnfα of idcs infected with wild type yeast cells and il- <dig> of mdcs were not increased significantly . although, il-1α transcripts were similarly elevated in idcs at  <dig> h post-infection with either wild type or lipase deficient c. parapsilosis, the increase was significantly greater with the lipase deficient yeast cells  . at  <dig> h, the expression levels with either type of c. parapsilosis were similarly increased . in comparison, mdcs stimulated with lipase deficient cells did not show statistically significant upregulation of il-1α transcript at  <dig> h relative to wild type, however the mrna level increased by almost  <dig> fold at  <dig> h . the il- <dig> gene was  <dig> fold upregulated in idcs infected with lipase deficient cells compared to wild type yeast at  <dig> h post-infection , although there were no differences at  <dig> h or during infection of mdcs. interestingly, the tnfα transcript progressively diminished upon exposure to wild type yeast cells, whereas it was upregulated in idcs infected with lipase deficient yeast cells. lipase deficient yeast induced significantly higher cxcl <dig> gene expression at both time points in idcs , whereas mdcs increased cxcl <dig> mrna levels only at  <dig> h post-infection .

for protein measurements, cell culture supernatants were collected at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-infection in order to allow protein translation to occur. we detected significantly higher amounts of il-1α in co-cultures of lipase deficient cells and idc at  <dig> h , but this difference was not significant at  <dig> h . in contrast, mdcs infected with lipase deficient yeast secreted significantly more il-1α protein at both time points  . consistent with the gene expression, we detected high levels of secreted il- <dig> in both idcs  and mdcs  at  <dig> and  <dig> hours. similarly, an elevated secretion of tnfα occurred in response to lipase deficient cells at both time points with idcs ; however, mdcs produced more tnfα only after  <dig> h . comparable levels of cxcl <dig> were measured at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after exposure to wild type or lipase deficient cells by both dc populations . these results indicate that, upon exposure to c. parapsilosis wild type or lipase deficient yeast, idcs and mdcs differentially produce il-1α, il- <dig> and tnfα.

discussion
the phagocytic capacity of macrophages and dendritic cells is an important feature during microbial infection, because the outcome of the interaction of phagocytic cells with fungal pathogens influences the susceptibility of the host to the infection  <cit> . in this work we demonstrate that the emerging fungal pathogen c. parapsilosis can be efficiently phagocytosed and killed by human monocyte derived dendritic cells. our results showed that after  <dig> h co-incubation  <dig> % of idc and  <dig> % of mdc had ingested c. parapsilosis wild type cells. interestingly, in a comparable study, approximately 60% of a given idc population phagocytose c. albicans  <cit>  thus, c. parapsilosis cells induce less phagocytosis in comparison to c. albicans. in addition, we also observed that lipase deficient c. parapsilosis cells were more efficiently ingested by idcs and mdcs relative to wild type yeast. the microscopy and facs results demonstrating avid dc phagocytosis of both wild type and lipase deficient yeast is consistent with an activated phenotype of these host effector cells. moreover, the enhanced phagocytosis of lipase deficient c. parapsilosis by dcs relative to wild type yeast cells suggests that lipase interferes with efficient dc activation.

dendritic cells are able to kill internalized fungal cells. the in vitro infections of dcs resulted in a 12% killing of c. parapsilosis wild type cells. this result is comparable with that of c. albicans   <cit> . moreover, dcs did not kill c. albicans cells as efficiently as monocytes or macrophages  <cit> , and the c. albicans findings and our results are consistent with the concept that the function of dc is to present candidal antigens to t-cells  <cit>  rather than to eliminate the microorganism. notably, our data showed a significantly elevated killing capacity of human dendritic cells against lipase deficient c. parapsilosis strain. in summary, dcs can effectively phagocytose c. parapsilosis, but the capacity to kill the yeast cells is less than that of macrophages  <cit>  and according to our recent results, fungal lipase suppresses the fungicidal activity of dcs.

the mechanisms involved in intracellular pathogenesis are diverse. among fungi, the most studied intracellular pathogen is histoplasma capsulatum, which is able to impair phagosome-lysosome fusion  <cit> . in the case of c. parapsilosis wild type strain, we observed that there is a defect in the maturation of the dc phago-lysosome using lysosomal markers of this process. this finding is in agreement with the related species c. albicans, where alterations of phagosome maturation and acidification defects have been described  <cit> . the lipase deficient mutants showed higher co-localization with lysotracker stain, suggesting more frequent phago-lysosome fusion and compartment acidification. in addition, our findings highlight that secreted fungal lipases appear to have a role in the protective mechanisms against the host intracellular killing processes.

the immune system may be activated by the recognition of nonself molecules of infectious agents or by recognition of danger signals that include host molecules released by damaged host cells  <cit> . it is proposed that the two models are compatible, which may also be the case in our model: both c. parapsilosis strains induced the expression of chemotactic molecules, in addition, dcs infected with lipase deficient yeast showed increased cell death which is known to be accompanied by the release of danger signals  <cit> . consequently, we propose that dcs infected with lipase deficient yeast cells activate more robust immune response.

although both wild type and lipase deficient c. parapsilosis induced strong, time-dependent activation of pro-inflammatory genes such as il-1α, il- <dig>  tnf-α, and cxcl- <dig> in both dc types, lipase deficient yeast induced significantly higher gene expression of effector molecules. since locally produced chemotactic factors are presumed to mediate the sequence of events leading to the infiltration of immune cells at inflammatory sites, local expression of pro-inflammatory mediators after contact with c. parapsilosis could have an initiator role in the attraction of additional immune cells to the sites of infection. this is supported by the fact that cxcl <dig> is one of the most potent neutrophil chemoattractants  <cit>  that affects not only the recruitment of neutrophils into the tissues but also modulates the ability of these neutrophils to cross epithelial barriers and to kill pathogens. in addition, tnf-α enhances the fungicidal properties of neutrophils, promotes the adhesion of immune to endothelial cells and acts as a danger signal. corresponding to this finding, we found that dcs infected with lipase deficient yeast cells displayed increased protease activity, which accompanies cell death and the release of danger signals. finally, tnf-α, il-1α and il- <dig> are also implicated in the induction of antimicrobial peptide expression in epithelial cells  <cit> . taken together, the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and the release of danger signals by dcs as a response to c. parapsilosis may play a crucial role in the recruitment of immune cells into the sites of infection.

CONCLUSIONS
our work shows that c. parapsilosis activates monocyte-derived dcs, as demonstrated by increased phagocytosis and killing of yeast cells and proinflammatory protein secretion. moreover, we found that dcs infected with lipase deficient c. parapsilosis are functionally more potent relative to dcs infected with wild type yeast cells, which suggests that lipase interferes with dc activation. this finding was unexpected because lipases of other pathogenic microorganisms are considered to be inducers of immune response, consequently one would have predicted a decreased activation phenotype in response to lipase deficient c. parapsilosis. the fact that this was not the case appears to result, at least in part, the dc activation is suppressed by the c. parapsilosis lipase. further studies will be required to identify the defective anti-c. parapsilosis effector mechanisms that increase susceptibility to invasive candidiasis and to determine how c. parapsilosis lipase represses immune activation.
