BACKGROUND
water transport across cell membranes is essential for life and in order to facilitate the transport of water and other small polar molecules across hydrophobic membranes, living organisms have evolved a wide array of membrane integral protein channels. these proteins, termed major intrinsic proteins , form a large and evolutionarily conserved superfamily of channel proteins, found in all types of organisms, including eubacteria, archaea, fungi, animals and plants  <cit> . mips are present in many different tissues in mammals and are likely to be of major importance for many different diseases , either directly or indirectly through their involvement in transport and water balance regulation. this general physiological involvement of mips has stimulated a growing interest in the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation and substrate specificity. in plants the functions of mips are more complex and their physiological roles are not as clear . however, the mere number of different mips in plants implies their importance, and it is likely that some isoforms play key roles in events such as rapid cell elongation and drought adaptation through their involvement in water transport regulation  <cit> . in order to fully understand whole plant water relations and the transport of other small polar molecules at a molecular level it is necessary to identify the complete set of mips along with their substrate specificities and expression patterns.

a comprehensive phylogenetic study of mips  <cit>  supports the classification of two main evolutionary groups. aquaporins  originally thought to specifically transport water, and glycerol-uptake facilitators or aquaglyceroporins  facilitating the transport of a variety of small neutral molecules. although the mips form passive channels, the permeability of the membrane is regulated by controlling the amount of different mips and also in some cases by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the channels. structures from x-ray and electron crystallography of mips  <cit>  show a tetrameric quaternary structure in which each monomer consists of six membrane spanning helices  connected by five loops . loop b  and loop e  form two half-membrane spanning helices  and interact with each other from opposing sides through two highly conserved aspargine-proline-alanine  boxes, forming a narrow region of the pore. a constriction region about  <dig> Å from the npa boxes toward the periplasmic side, termed the aromatic/arginine  region, is formed by two residues from h <dig> and h <dig> and two residues from loop e. this region forms a primary selection filter and is a major checkpoint for solute permeability .

plant mips form a large and divergent superfamily of proteins with more than thirty identified members encoded in each of the genomes of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , zea mays  <cit>  and oryza sativa  <cit> . these large numbers of mips likely reflect a wide diversity in substrate specificity, localisation, transcriptional and posttranslational regulation. based on sequence similarity plant mips have been divided into five subfamilies; the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , the tonoplast intrinsic proteins , the nodulin- <dig> like intrinsic proteins , the small basic intrinsic proteins  and the glpf-like intrinsic protein   <cit> . the gips have so far only been identified in physcomitrella patens and another closely related moss  <cit> . each of the other subfamilies can be further divided into groups based on sequence similarity  <cit> . even though all mips in higher plants phylogenetically belong to the aqp clade of mips  <cit>  they are not all highly specific for water. several studies have shown plant mips to be permeable also to other molecules, for example tips have been reported to facilitate urea and ammonia transport  <cit> ; nips to transport glycerol  <cit> , ammonia  <cit> , lactic acid  <cit> , boron  <cit>  and silicon  <cit> ; pips have been postulated to be able to facilitate co <dig> diffusion  <cit>  and for the sips water transport has only been reported for the sip <dig> subgroup  <cit> . the difference in transport specificity is likely due to major differences in the ar/r filter of plant mips, as has been suggested for mips in a. thaliana, z. mays and o. sativa  <cit> .

p. patens is a moss  and as such diverged from the lineage leading to higher plants approximately 443– <dig> million years ago, before the evolution of vascular plants  <cit> . this makes p. patens a valuable source of information in evolutionary comparisons with higher plants and any common features found can be expected to be present in most terrestrial plants. in addition p. patens has properties that make it an attractive plant model for future functional studies, above all the possibility of homologous recombination . an assembled genome of p. patens , based on  <dig>  times coverage, has recently been released by the joint genome institute  <cit>  and has made it possible to extend the analysis of gene family evolution back to basal land plant lineages. such an analysis has previously been described for the expansin superfamily of proteins  <cit>  and we now present a similar analysis of the mip superfamily. in agreement with the expansin study, we also hypothesised that p. patens were to have a simpler superfamily structure due to less need of cell-specific expression, a hypothesis that was partially proven wrong by the data collected for p. patens. in our analysis we did not only identify the five previously defined subfamilies  but also found two previously uncategorised mip subfamilies; the hybrid intrinsic proteins  and the uncategorized x intrinsic proteins , a subfamily which we found also to be present in many other plant species. this data implies that mip subfamilies evolved early on in plants and that the existence of diverse subfamilies reflects differences in subcellular localisation, substrate specificity, transcriptional and/or posttranslational regulation already of importance in primitive plants, whereas the specificity needed only in higher plants  is covered by the mip groups that evolved later within the subfamilies present in higher plants.

in this study we try to address plant mip function from an evolutionary perspective by comparing the whole set of mips in a primitive land plant  with those of two higher plants . by annotating the whole mip superfamily in p. patens we also lay the foundation for future functional studies in a plant system allowing homologous recombination and all advantages of this, such as knocking out/replacing endogenous genes.

RESULTS
identification of physcomitrella patens mips
the recent sequencing of the moss p. patens genome  <cit>  has for the first time made it possible to identify all mip genes in a more primitive plant and hence to make conclusions on the molecular evolution of the mip superfamily of proteins. searches of the physcomitrella patens ssp patens v <dig>  database  at jgi, using the  <dig> protein sequences of the complete set of a. thaliana mips   <cit> , resulted in identification of  <dig> different genes encoding p. patens mips  . two genes were identical at nucleotide level and therefore only one protein sequence , representing both genes, was included in further analyses. ppgip1; <dig>  a p. patens mip previously described in detail by gustavsson et al  <cit>  was also included in the ppmip set which were then reaching a total of  <dig> full length mips. four genes encoding partial mip-like sequences were also identified. of these, three were either partial or contained premature stop codons and therefore considered to be non-functional pseudogenes . the fourth sequence might represent a functional mip encoding gene, but was situated in a short contig interrupted by a large sequencing gap after the identified exon and could therefore not be included in the analysis . the jgi gene models were manually inspected and considered correct for most ppmip genes. however, for some genes a different annotation of the coding sequence in the genomic sequence was favoured either by cdna sequences or due to a better conservation of subfamily specific sequences and gene structure. these alternative assignations of exons, specified in table  <dig>  were used in all translations and analyses in this paper.

when this study was initiated only  <dig> out of the  <dig> ppmips had been described in the literature  <cit> . since then one more of the  <dig> ppmips  has been published  <cit> . all  <dig> ppmip sequences were categorized as belonging to an aquaporin eukaryotic orthologous groups  at the ppdb and most of these also had a suggested classification . based on the phylogeny of the ppmips together with the atmips and z. mays mips  a new and more systematic classification of the ppmips, that is consistent with the atmips and zmmips nomenclature  <cit> , is proposed .

phylogeny and classification
using the full length protein alignments of all ppmips, atmips and zmmips  the neighbour joining  method resulted in one tree  which was compared to trees from the maximum parsimony  method and the bayesian  method. bootstrap support and bayesian posterior probabilities were used to construct a "method-consensus" cladogram summarizing the results of the three methods and used to classify the ppmips . the classification of atmips and zmmips in subgroups within subfamilies is similar for all mips except the nips. we named the ppnips according to the nomenclature used in classification of the nips in z. mays and o. sativa since these four wider subgroups allow more sequence divergence and hence are more generic than the more narrow seven subgroups defined in a. thaliana. p. patens subgroups that failed to group with the previously classified subfamily groups were given consecutive higher indices . in total  <dig> pppip1s,  <dig> pppip2s,  <dig> pppip <dig>   <dig> pptip6s,  <dig> ppnip <dig>   <dig> ppnip5s,  <dig> ppnip <dig> and  <dig> ppsip1s were categorized. four ppmips failed to be classified into a subfamily, since they lack orthologs among the mips identified in a. thaliana and z. mays. one of these was the mip xenolog  ppgip1; <dig> previously identified as a glpf-like mip and named accordingly  <cit> . the remaining three were the pphip1; <dig> which shares similarities with both tips and pips but forms a separate distinct subfamily of its own, and the ppxip1; <dig> and ppxip1; <dig>  two divergent mips that share some unique previously undescribed motifs.

to find orthologs of the three uncategorized ppmips  searches of databases at ncbi and embl were conducted. hits representing a wide variety of species were selected and the corresponding protein sequences were aligned with the pppips, the pptips and either pphip1; <dig> or ppxip1; <dig> and ppxip1; <dig>  the alignments were used in phylogenetic analyses to evaluate if the newly acquired sequences could help in categorizing the three ppmips. the pphip1; <dig> hits were mainly annotated as tips or aqp4s in the databases and the phylogenetic analysis resulted in three clusters  but pphip1; <dig> were still basal to all of these and could therefore not be assigned to any of these subfamilies . as for ppxip1; <dig> and ppxip1; <dig>  hits were mostly annotated as plant mip, tip or aqp <dig> sequences. the phylogenetic analysis resulted in four different subfamilies, tips, pips aqp0s and a fourth clade consisting of unspecified plant mips and the ppxips , see further analyses in next paragraph.

the xips – an unrecognized mip subfamily in higher plants
sequences belonging to this fourth clade have a weak overall sequence similarity to mips in general , and could neither be assigned to any of the previously identified classes of plant mips  nor be associated with the pphip1; <dig> sequence. however, some conserved motifs within this new subfamily  were identified and based on these one representative sequence  was selected. this sequence was used in database searches in order to obtain more mips belonging to this novel subfamily. a handful of more sequences that all shared the same conserved motifs were identified. one of these sequences originated from populus trichocarpa and therefore the p. trichocarpa genome at jgi were searched, identifying  <dig> more paralogs . these sequences, together with the sequences retrieved from the castor bean cdna and the ppxip searches and all ppmip sequences  were combined into one sequence alignment used in phylogenetic analysis. the resulting trees confirmed that the unclassified mips form a distinct monophyletic clade , different from the other mips included in the analysis . as shown in table  <dig> there is considerable variation both at the first npa box and the ar/r filter among the sequences in this clade. we propose that, awaiting further characterization, mips in the new subfamily should be referred to as x intrinsic proteins  emphasizing that currently we have very little information on the function of these proteins.

gene structure
the average ppmip was found to have  <dig>  introns with a size of  <dig>  bp. this is about half the number of introns, but of approximately the same size as predicted for the average p. patens gene in a genome wide analysis  <cit> . the exon/intron patterns of the ppmips were found to be highly conserved within each subfamily, as shown in figure  <dig>  comparison with the atmips showed the intron positions to be conserved for both pips and nips, but not for tips  and sips . the exon/intron pattern also supported that the pphip and the ppxips were to be classified neither as pips, tips, nips, sips nor gips, but rather as separate subfamilies on their own.

the identification of five p. trichocarpa xip paralogs allowed comparison of gene structure across species. all five p. trichocarpa genes have the same pattern of exon-introns with two introns in the n-terminal sequence . this is also true for the ppxip1; <dig>  but since the n-termini have a high degree of interspecies variation it is hard to make any conclusion on whether the intron positions are exactly conserved.

discussion
physcomitrella patens major intrinsic proteins
comparison of protein superfamilies of distantly related species can aid in our understanding of protein function and by annotating all mips in p. patens we have made such a comparison possible for the mip superfamily of higher plants and mosses. originally we hypothesised that mosses were to have a relatively small superfamily, due to them being simpler . it was therefore much to our surprise that we found p. patens to have seven subfamilies containing in total  <dig> different mips, an unexpected large and divergent superfamily. one of these  is analysed in detail by gustavsson et al.  <cit> , and is therefore omitted from this discussion. half of the remaining  <dig> ppmips are previously described by borstlap  <cit>  and lienard et al.  <cit>  and the remaining  <dig> are previously not described in the literature. the gene structure of the ppmips supports the phylogenetic analyses and the resulting division into seven subfamilies. comparison with atmips shows that pips and nips have conserved intron positions whereas sips and tips do not. this is consistent with the conservation of individual groups of the nip and pip subfamily in both p. patens and a. thaliana .

pips – the most conserved mips in plants
pips are remarkably well conserved plant mips that can be further classified into pip1s and pip2s. both pip1s and pip2s are highly conserved in p. patens indicating that these groups must have formed early on in the evolution of land plants and are of fundamental importance in plant physiology. the physiological relevance of pip1s and pip2s in water relations in higher plants is well established and recently also carbon dioxide has been added to the list of possible substrates . the ar/r filter is strictly conserved in pips including pppips suggesting that all pips, irrespectively of subgroup, have the same substrate specificity . it is likely that the evolution of pip sequences is constrained also in many other ways. for example the pips reside in the plasma membrane and it is essential that they are impermeable for protons in order to maintain the proton gradient. furthermore, the water permeability of pips can be regulated by phosphorylations, ph and ca2+ via an intricate gating mechanism  <cit> . from our results presented here it is clear that the diacidic motif in the n-terminal region and the histidine in the d-loop responsible for ca2+ binding and ph gating, respectively, are both conserved in all pppip1s and pppip2s. the phosphorylation site in loop b is also conserved in all pppips whereas the pip <dig> specific c-terminal phosphorylation motif is restricted to the pppip2s. this suggests that the gating mechanism is generic in all species and tissues where pips are expressed and that for instance ph gating is not limited to anaerobic conditions in roots of higher plants.

in p. patens there is also an odd pip , basal to both pip1s and pip2s. the pppip3; <dig> has a deletion of  <dig> amino acids after the second npa-box  and this, together with the relatively high divergence from other pips  and the absence of ests, makes it questionable if this mip gene is at all functional.

tips specialization occurred later
it has already been suggested that p. patens is lacking the specific isoforms of tips observed in higher plants  <cit>  and now, with this complete set of ppmips at hand, this is confirmed. interestingly, it has been proposed that vacuole sub-types harbor specific sets of tip isoforms  <cit>  and it is easy to speculate that the tip groups in higher plants evolved due to special functional requirements of different vacuoles. the identification of conserved proteins in p. patens, involved in the sorting of proteins to different types of vacuoles, suggests that there are most likely more than one type of vacuole in bryophytes  <cit> . this implies that tips are not conserved markers for subtypes of vacuoles as the presence of only one group of tips in p. patens indicates that either there is only one of the vacuole types in moss that has tips, or alternatively several different vacuoles in the moss cell all have the same type of tips. both interpretations are consistent with recent experiments in higher plants that have challenged the idea of tips as valid markers for vacuole sub-types  <cit> .

rather than forming a very distant subclass of tips, the pptip6s appears as a conserved mosaic of the different motifs that are found in the different tip groups of higher plants. for example the first few amino acid residues at the n-terminus are similar to tip2s, whereas the c-terminal region is most similar to tip3s. the identities of the amino acid residues at the ar/r filter  are shared with both some tip3s and tip4s suggesting a similar specificity. in fact exactly these residues are the most common, comparing the frequencies in the selectivity regions of all a. thaliana, z. mays and o. sativa tips . this makes it likely that pptip6s are similar to the tips present in the last common ancestor of bryophytes and vascular plants and that the other motifs found at these positions are derived characters that have appeared later as different groups of tips evolved in vascular plants. the expansion and formation of specialized groups in the tip subfamily of higher plants might suggest that some of these tips have taken over the functions of the mips of subfamilies that are missing in higher plants .

nip groups evolved early
in higher plants nips form a divergent subfamily with large variation between species. this is true also for nips in p. patens, but surprisingly one of the three nip groups identified is present also in higher plants, indicating that this group of nips, nip <dig>  was present already in a common ancestor to p. patens and higher plants . the conserved intron positions among nips in a. thaliana and p. patens indicate that this gene structure was also present in the ancestral nip gene. nips are different from other mips in that they often have unorthodox npa boxes. in many nip3s of higher plants the first and second npa boxes are replaced by nps and npv, respectively  <cit> . the corresponding motifs in ppnip3; <dig> are npa and npv , which is identical to atnip6; <dig> , suggesting that nip3s had these motifs before the split of bryophytes and vascular plants.

the two nip groups specific for p. patens , have a unique combination of amino acids at the ar/r filter . in contrast the ar/r region of ppnip3; <dig> conforms to the residues found in other nip3s, supporting that they are orthologs with the same conserved function. recently a nip <dig> have been shown to have a role in boron uptake in roots of a. thaliana  <cit>  and even though mosses lack roots it cannot be ruled out that ppnip3; <dig> has a role in boron transport in the moss.

the n-terminal region of nips is relatively long compared to most other plant mips and is encoded on a separate exon. due to the lack of generally conserved motifs in this region the first exon is often missing in annotations of nip genes. however, within nip3s of higher plants several motifs have been recognized in the n-terminal region  <cit>  and some of these features are also conserved in ppnip3; <dig>  similar to higher plants ppnip3; <dig> has a high degree of proline and threonine residues and a sequence , corresponding to the conserved motif  in higher plants.

many nips in higher plants have a conserved potential phosphorylation motif in the c-terminal region corresponding to the phosphorylation site in glycine max nod <dig>  and spinacia oleracea pip2; <dig>   <cit> . a serine at this position is also present in a similar motif in nip3s of higher plants   <cit>  but not in ppnip3; <dig> where the serine is substituted to a valine. in ppnip5; <dig> and ppnip6; <dig> there are serines but some of the basic residues in the motif are not conserved. in contrast a corresponding serine in the motif  is present in ppnip5; <dig> and ppnip5; <dig> suggesting that at least some nips in a common ancestor of bryophytes and higher plants were regulated by phosphorylation.

it is interesting to see that there is no nip <dig> type of mip in p. patens, a nip-group recently identified as a silicon transporter in rice  <cit> . since bryophytes are known to accumulate silicon  <cit> , the lack of ppnip2s suggests that this function is carried out by a different isoform or class of proteins in p. patens.

only sip1s are found in physcomitrella patens
in a. thaliana there are two classes of sips, sip1s and sip2s, both having the same gene structure with two introns at conserved positions  <cit> . in p. patens there are two sips but neither of them has an intron. surprisingly both of the ppsips belong to the sip <dig> group whereas sip2s of higher plants form a basal clade. this suggests that either sip2s were present already in early land plants but were subsequently lost in p. patens in which the remaining sip1s were subject to intron loss, or that sip2s have rapidly diverged from sip1s after the split leading to mosses and higher plants. an intron loss in ppsip1s or an intron gain in a common ancestor to sip1s and sip2s in higher plant is equally likely in this scenario. in most sip1s the corresponding sequence to the first npa box is npt, interestingly this unusual motif is conserved also in ppsip1s, implying that this is a structurally and functionally important feature of sip1s. in addition the ar/r filter is consistent with the phylogenetic classification, suggesting a conserved function of sip1s among terrestrial plants.

hip a unique mip with similarities to both pips and tips
there are three p. patens mip sequences that cannot be classified into any of the five subfamilies previously described in plants  <cit> . one of these, the pphip1; <dig>  seems to be a rather rare mip, since we were not able to identify any orthologs. the unique gene structure indicates that this protein belongs to a separate subfamily. in phylogenetic analyses pphip1; <dig> tend to cluster with pips and tips, although the support for this is not very strong as seen in figure  <dig>  upon looking at the ar/r filter  one could also speculate that the hip is related to tips and pips, since it has histidines both at the h <dig> position, typical for tips and the h <dig> position, typical for pips. what effect having two large and basic amino acid residues in the filter will have on transport properties is however unclear, and since there are no ests of the gene it might even be that it is not expressed. according to a subcellular localization prediction  pphip1; <dig> is slightly more likely to reside in the tonoplast than the plasma membrane. further studies are required to explore expression, localization and substrate specificity of the pphip.

the two other sequences belong to another group, the xips, further discussed in the next paragraph.

the xip subfamily
a search for ppxip orthologs resulted in the finding of many xip sequences from a wide variety of species, including five paralogs from p. trichocarpa . it is striking that no sequences are from monocots. although most sequences were from dicots, no ortholog was found in a. thaliana, which may be explained by gene loss due to a relatively recent reduction of the genome size  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses confirmed that these sequences are from a, to our knowledge, previously unrecognized mip subfamily, different from pips, tips, nips, sips and gips. the only non-plant sequence included in the analyses was a protein encoded by the  gene from the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum ax <dig> and it should be pointed out that although this protein is clustering with the xips in phylogenetic analyses, it is annotated as a hypothetical protein and lacks some of the characteristics of the xips. for example the amoeba protein has npa boxes and an ar/r filter different from all other xips and also an overall highly divergent mip sequence, all which makes it questionable if this protein has the same function as other xips. there is also a sequence from a lycophyte, the spike moss selaginella moellendorffii, which together with the two ppxips are the three most divergent sequences albeit all three are clearly categorisable as xips. although most sequences were derived from ests, no general conclusion could be made on expression pattern, since xip transcripts were isolated from many different tissues ranging from roots, seedlings, flower buds to seeds and fruits . based on a subcellular localization prediction xips are likely to be situated in the plasma membrane .

in the first npa box of the xips, the alanine is replaced by a valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine or cysteine. all of these replacements, except isoleucine, have been observed in npa boxes of other mips  <cit> . the most conserved feature of the new subfamily is located after the second npa box, where a cysteine amino acid is thoroughly conserved in the motif nparc. this cysteine is only a moderate change of the conserved serine or threonine found in many other subfamilies e.g. pips, tips, nips and in several mammalian aqps. however, from the solved structure of sopip2; <dig> it is clear that residues at this position can stabilize the conformation of the c-loop by hydrogen bonds  an interaction that seem to be structurally conserved and that also can be seen in btaqp <dig> , btaqp <dig>  and, with the donor-acceptor interchanged, in ecglpf . this stabilisation is probably directly affecting the permeability of the pore since the orientation of the arginine of the ar/r filter is also stabilised by a hydrogen bond to the backbone of the c-loop . interestingly all the xips also have a conserved cysteine resulting in the motif lggc in the c-loop at a position that can be aligned to n <dig> in sopip2; <dig>  this suggests that a cysteine bridge may covalently fixate the c-loop relative to the arginine in the xips and that the extracellular entrance to the pore therefore might be more rigid than that of other mips.

there is also a highly conserved motif with a proline at the end of helix  <dig>   <dig> amino acids before the first npa-box , also found in mammalian aqp5s. a corresponding motif can be found in helix  <dig> of many other plant mips, which is interesting as this reflects the symmetry of the mip proteins, consisting of two direct repeats of sequence. it is also worth noting that, with the exception of ppxips, there is a lack of an otherwise highly conserved glycine in helix  <dig>  allowing the close packing of helix  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , which in most xips is replaced by either a leucine or an isoleucine. an alternative alignment that retains the conserved glycine, but introduces two extra amino acids between helix  <dig> and the second npa box is possible, but not used in the analysis presented here. this alignment will also affect which amino acid is positioned in the h <dig> position of the ar/r filter . in the chosen alignment a valine is the most frequent residue in the h <dig> position and in the alternative alignment threonine would be in the h <dig> position. at the h <dig> position most xips have an aliphatic amino acid, something that can also be found in some nips and sips  <cit> . this suggests that xips are not primarily water channels, although substrate specificity experiments have to be carried out to establish this. in the xips from p. patens and s. moellendorffii there is a glutamine at the h <dig> respectively h <dig> position of the ar/r filter, also found in tip4s and tip5s of higher plants, suggesting that maybe these tips have taken over some function of the xips in primitive plants. further studies of localization, specificity and expression patterns are needed in order to determine the function of this novel mip subfamily.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified a surprisingly large number of mip encoding genes in p. patens, forming a diverse superfamily with seven subfamilies. in total  <dig> ppmips were identified; eight pips, four tips, five nips and two sips, one gip and three mips belonging to two different, novel subfamilies, the hips and the xips. hips are hitherto not found in any higher plants, whereas the xips seem to be present in many plant species, although not in monocots. interestingly, specific groups within the subfamilies, like pip1s, pip2s, nip3s and possibly sip1s were already present in a common ancestor of higher plants and bryophytes. in contrast, the subgroups of tips probably evolved later. these results suggest that early land plants had a large and divergent mip superfamily consisting of at least the seven subfamilies found in p. patens and that during the evolution of higher plants some subfamilies were lost  whereas remaining subfamilies evolved further resulting in diversification and formation of subgroups within the subfamilies. we speculate that some of the new subgroups, or perhaps some other unrelated transporters have taken over the function of the lost mip subfamilies in higher plants.
