BACKGROUND
progesterone plays a key role in the development, differentiation and maintenance of normal and malignant female tissues. its effects are mediated by progesterone receptors , members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. prs exist as two major, functionally different  <cit>  isoforms--pr-a  and pr-b . they are multidomain proteins consisting of a central dna-binding domain ; large n-termini with a proximal activation function  common to both isoforms; a distal af- <dig> in the b-upstream segment  restricted to pr-b; and at their c-termini, a nuclear localization signal in a hinge region upstream of an af-2-containing ligand binding domain   <cit> . prs are transactivators that can be tethered to dna through other transcription factors  <cit>  but more commonly are bound directly to dna at palindromic progesterone-response elements   <cit> . the two isoforms bind dna with equivalent affinity  <cit>  so this cannot explain their functional differences. rather, dissimilar coregulator recruitment has been invoked for their differences  <cit> . these coactivators or corepressors facilitate receptor/dna occupancy, chromatin remodeling and recruitment of general transcription factors associated with the rna polymerase ii holocomplex  <cit> . function of the receptors and their coregulators are in turn controlled by posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation  <cit>  that influence hormone sensitivity and promoter selectivity, among others  <cit> . ubiquitination for example, promotes ligand-dependent pr protein downregulation via proteasomal degradation, which paradoxically maximizes transcriptional activity  <cit> . because these modifications are reversible, enzymes that dephosphorylate, deacetylate, deubiquitinate and desumoylate prs also alter activity  <cit> , so that permutations of these modifications undoubtedly play a large role in the complex signaling patterns ascribed to the receptors  <cit> .

transcriptional synergy and pr sumoylation
additional complexity arises from the structure of dna to which prs bind. cooperativity among receptors bound at compound promoters consisting of two or more pres results in synergism defined as a "more-than-additive" transcriptional effect  <cit> . iniguez-lluhi and pearce  <cit>  first identified a short synergy control  motif in glucocorticoid receptors  that disrupted synergy on promoters with multiple response elements. its mutation induced strong synergistic effects but only at compound response elements. the sc motif turned out to be a sumoylation site at which conjugation of sumo- <dig>  a  <dig> amino acid  small ubiquitin-like modifier, disrupted synergy  <cit> . similar sites in both gr and pr  <cit>  contain a lysine  residue embedded in the consensus sequence Ψkxe  located in the n-terminal af- <dig> domains of the receptors. for human pr-b this sequence is centered at k <dig>  and at a homologous site of pr-a. monomeric sumo- <dig> covalently binds this site through a series of dynamic and reversible enzymatic reactions involving an e <dig> sumo activating enzyme, an e <dig> conjugating enzyme  and e <dig> ligases ). desumoylation is catalyzed by one of six human sentrin-specific proteases  that target sumo. largely due to their roles in modifying the activity of steroid receptors, both ubc <dig> and pias have at times been classified as transcriptional coregulators  <cit> . mouse knockouts of ubc <dig> or senp <dig> are embryonic lethal, demonstrating that the balance of sumoylation and desumoylation is essential for development  <cit> . most, but not all steroid receptors--the exception appearing to be estrogen receptors --are targets of sumoylation. this is consistent with the fact that phylogenetic and sequence alignments of gr, mineralocorticoid receptors , androgen receptors  and pr links them to a steroid receptor subfamily characterized by much larger n-termini  than the n-termini of erα or erβ . as a result in vitro translated ar and gr, but not erα or erβ, are sumoylated  <cit> .

sumo conjugation of pr-b at k <dig>  is hormone dependent and occurs via pias <dig>  <cit>  or pias <dig>  <cit> . this suppresses pr -dependent transcription of promoters containing multiple pres but not a single pre  <cit> . additionally, overexpression of pias <dig> can induce pr-b sumoylation at k <dig> and k <dig>  <cit>  but the physiological relevance of this is unclear. sumo is deconjugated from the receptors by senps, which, like desumoylation by mutation of k <dig>  dramatically enhances pr transcriptional activity  <cit> . the relationship between the transcriptional efficacy of desumoylation and the role of ligand-dependent pr downregulation are contradictory. zhang and coworker  <cit>  showed that mutation of pr-b at k <dig> retards progesterone-induced degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. in contrast, we and others  <cit>  have shown that pr k388r mutants undergo accelerated ligand-dependent downregulation thereby explaining their heightened transcriptional activity.

in the present study we analyze the functional effects of senp-induced pr desumoylation in detail. our results indicate that on a compound promoter, senp <dig> enhances transcription in a dose-dependent manner, but this requires full-length pr. however enhanced transcription is independent of pr dna binding specificity or the pr s <dig> phosphorylation site. by desumoylating pr, senp increases pr sensitivity to hormone. the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a  has a marked biphasic effect. at high concentrations, which promote global histone hyperacetylation and modify many proteins  <cit> , tsa strongly suppresses transcription and this is reversed by the coactivator src- <dig>  however, low tsa concentrations upregulate pr-dependent transcription. this effect of tsa is uncoupled from inhibition by sumoylation indicating that hdac activity is not involved in transcriptional synergy controlled by senp <dig> 

RESULTS
senp and pr desumoylation
sumoylation and the promoter context of pr transcriptional synergy
we previously showed  <cit>  that sumoylation at k <dig>  is hormone-dependent and suppresses pr-b and pr-a-regulated transcription of an exogenous promoter containing two  or more palindromic pres but not a single pre. to assess the generality of this, we used the mmtv-ltr, which contains  <dig> palindromic pre and  <dig> pre half-sites. in contrast to grs that prefer the palindrome, the half-sites are preferentially used by prs  <cit> , possibly as monomers  <cit> . to examine the role of pr sumoylation on transcriptional synergy involving pre half-sites, hela cells were transfected with 5- <dig> ng of dna encoding wild-type pr-b or the sumoylation-deficient k388r pr-b mutant  <cit> , together with the pre2-luc  or mmtv-luc  reporters, in the presence of the progestin r <dig>  pr-b were tested since they are more potent transactivators of the mmtv-ltr than pr-a  <cit> . on pre2-luc, wild-type pr-b were transcriptionally active, and mutation of their k <dig> sumoylation motif synergistically raised transcription further as receptor concentrations were increased between  <dig> and  <dig> ng dna. high pr concentrations  led to a decrement in transcription likely due to transcription factor "squelching"  <cit> . wild-type pr-b dependent transcription on mmtv-ltr showed a similar dose-dependent increase. however, absolutely no transcriptional synergy was observed with the k388r pr-b mutant suggesting that sumoylation does not control synergy on pre half-sites. most of the studies below use pre2-luc

desumoylation by senp
the k388r pr mutant is an artificial construct while proteins are naturally desumoylated by senps in vivo  <cit> . to examine effects of in vivo pr desumoylation, wild-type pr-b  and gfp-sumo <dig>  were cotransfected into hela cells together with senp <dig> or senp <dig> expression vectors , and unliganded or liganded pr-b sumoylation states were assessed by immunoblotting . pr-b are not sumoylated by ligand in the absence of sumo- <dig> , or by sumo- <dig> in the absence of ligand , but approximately 5% of the receptors are sumoylated when both are present . however, in cells co-expressing senp <dig>  or senp <dig>  sumo1-pr conjugates are essentially absent. a r630l, k631m senp <dig> mutant , whose catalytic function is disabled  <cit> , was unable to desumoylate pr .

we next tested effects of increasing concentrations of dna  encoding senp <dig>  senp1m and senp <dig> on pre2-luc transcription by r5020-liganded, wild-type pr-b transiently expressed in hela cells  or stably expressed in t47d breast cancer cells . analogous to the k388r sumoylation-deficient pr-b mutant, desumoylation by senp <dig> and senp <dig> strongly enhanced the transcriptional activity of wild-type liganded pr-b in both cell types in a dose-dependent manner. the senp1m control was ineffective . it is of interest that these extensive transcriptional effects of sumoylation/desumoylation are regulated by a minor subpopulation of pr molecules . indeed, the pr sumoylation state and its control of transcription applies even to weak progestin agonists as shown by the fact that desumoylation by senps intensifies transcription by the mixed agonist/antagonist ru <dig>  <cit> , but has no effect on transcription by the pure antagonist zk <dig>  or the pr-b k388r mutant  were co-expressed with increasing  concentrations of senp <dig>  and tested on pre2-luc  or mmtv-luc . senp <dig> enhanced pr-b-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner on pre2-luc, but was ineffective in modifying transcription by pr-b k388r on the same reporter, indicating that the response to senp <dig> requires the pr sumoylation site. this was confirmed on mmtv-luc  where senp <dig> had no effect despite strong transcription with wild-type pr-b, confirming that the pres of mmtv-ltr are not pr sumoylation sensitive . we conclude that senp <dig> modifies pr-dependent transcription directly at the pr sumoylation site, which is also required for the cooperativity-driven synergy observed on a pre <dig> 

senp action on pr: mechanisms
activation functions
to assess whether senp modifies activity via afs, two pr deletion mutants were tested: 1) nt-b, a constitutively active pr n-terminal construct  <cit>  containing af- <dig>  af- <dig> and its ψkxe sumoylation site, linked to the dbd but missing the c-terminal af- <dig> of the lbd ; 2) dbd-lbd, the pr dbd linked to the c-terminal lbd and its af- <dig> . the constructs  were transfected into hela cells expressing increasing concentrations  of dna encoding senp <dig> or senp1m and transcription was measured using pre2-luc. nt-b is strongly active in the absence of ligand . despite containing the pr sumoylation site, senp <dig> was unable to further increase this strong constitutive activity. this confirms that nt-b is not sumoylated in the absence of the lbd  <cit> , making it insensitive to senp <dig>  rather, we observe a dose-dependent repression by senp <dig> requiring its catalytic activity  suggesting an effect by senp <dig> on desumoylation of n-terminal interacting coregulatory factors. wild-type senp <dig> does not have a repressive effect on the weak ligand-dependent transcription of dbd-lbd ; likely the target of different, possibly non-sumoylated, c-terminal interacting coregulators.

dna binding specificity
next we assessed the role of the pr dbd in mediating effects of senp <dig> using two additional constructs: 1) a full-length pr-b spec "specificity" mutant in which the pr dbd was replaced by the dbd of er , and 2) wild-type er . both were tested on tandem estrogen response elements  linked to luciferase. the pr-b specificity mutant was treated with r <dig> ; er was treated with 17β-estradiol. the receptor-encoding constructs  were transfected into hela cells without or with hormones together with increasing  senp <dig> concentrations. the pr-b specificity mutant exhibited weak ligand-dependent transcriptional activity, which was dramatically enhanced by senp1-mediated desumoylation in a dose-dependent manner. this suggests that unlike the pr lbd, neither the pr dbd nor its dna binding site influence sumoylation of the pr n-terminus. the dbd dimer interface of steroid receptors stabilizes binding to palindromic hres. interestingly, disruption of the dimer interface markedly increases transcriptional activity of receptors bound to multiple pres  indicating that dbd dimerization generally suppresses synergy. wild-type ers were unaffected by senp <dig>  consistent with our previous report  <cit>  that ers are not substrates of sumoylation. this failure is not controlled by the er dbd or eres since both support sumoylation in the context of pr-b. unlike n-terminal coregulatory proteins of pr , er transcriptional coregulators appear to be unaffected by their sumoylation state.

sensitivity to ligand
since sumoylation reduces pr-b sensitivity to hormone  <cit>  we speculated that desumoylation by senp would reverse this effect. to test this, hela cells expressing constant levels of pr-b or the prb k388r mutant , in the absence or presence of constant senp <dig> levels  were treated  <dig> hrs with r <dig> at doses ranging from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m. transcription levels on pre2-luc were plotted as a percent of maximal induction by 10- <dig> m r <dig> above "no hormone" controls. curve fitting was performed by prism graph as described under "experimental procedures" . senp <dig> reduced the dose of r <dig> required for half-maximal transcription  by wild-type pr-b ~ <dig> -fold, from  <dig> - <dig> m to  <dig> - <dig> m . senp <dig> had little or no effect on the ec <dig>  of the sumoylation deficient k388r mutant whose intrinsic r5020-binding affinity exceeded that of wild-type pr ~2-fold. this indicates that desumoylated pr are exquisitely sensitive to very low hormone concentrations; also explaining enhancement of the agonist properties of ru <dig> . saturating hormone concentrations were similar for the two receptors .

senp, pr phosphorylation and mapk signaling
prs are phosphorylated on multiple serine residues , three of which--s <dig>  s <dig> and s345--are currently known to be ligand-dependent  <cit> . contradictory reports indicate on the one hand that pr-b phosphorylation is uncoupled from sumoylation  <cit> , and on the other that mapk-catalyzed s <dig> phosphorylation antagonizes pr-b sumoylation  <cit> . to assess interactions between desumoylation and mapk signaling, we analyzed transcription in the presence of senp <dig>  and map/erk kinase kinase , a strong activator of mapk-dependent pr phosphorylation, using wild type pr-b, pr-b s294/ <dig> phosphorylation-deficient mutants, or pr-b k388r sumoylation-deficient mutants . on wild-type pr , senp <dig> and mekk <dig> increased transcription equally, and their combined effects were additive. a key difference between the two is that senp <dig> does not alter basal transcriptional activity, but mekk raises it . the phosphorylation deficient mutant  remained responsive to senp <dig>  dissociating s294/ <dig> phosphorylation from desumoylation. interestingly, mekk <dig> also activated this mutant suggesting either that other pr sites, or pr coregulatory proteins, are mekk-regulated in the s294/345-deficient receptors. finally, senp <dig> failed to hyperactivate the constitutively active k388r mutant , as would be expected. however, mekk <dig> was able to activate this sumoylation-deficient pr or the constitutively active nt-b , uncoupling mekk-dependent activation from pr k <dig> sumoylation. activation of mapk signaling by overexpressing mekk <dig> has complex, concentration-dependent effects on pr sumoylation. at low concentrations, mekk <dig> induces ligand-independent pr sumoylation . at high concentrations, mekk <dig> suppresses hormone-dependent pr sumoylation .

senp, histone deacetylases  and src- <dig> coactivation
repression of the elk- <dig> transcription factor by sumoylation couples with recruitment to promoters of histone deacetylases, to further repress elk- <dig> target genes  <cit> . this suggests that hdacs are involved in the transcriptional repression by sumo  <cit> . we asked whether hdacs are involved in the synergy control and regulation of pr activity by senp <dig>  we first analyzed baseline effects of trichostatin a --an hdac inhibitor that brings about chromatin decondensation  <cit> --on pr-b-dependent transcription of pre2-luc . there was a marked biphasic response. compared to untreated controls, low doses of tsa  upregulated both basal and liganded pr-b dependent transcription, while excessive tsa doses  were strongly inhibitory. similar inhibitory effects of tsa have been attributed to incompatibility between hyperacetylation of chromatin and assembly of coactivators on the rna pol ii complex  <cit> . to assess this, we analyzed the ability of steroid receptor coactivator  <dig>  to coactivate pr-b on pre2-luc, at low  or high  tsa concentrations. at low tsa concentrations , hela cells express sufficient endogenous src- <dig> to maximally coactivate pr-b dependent transcription, and exogenous addition of excess src- <dig>  does not alter these already high levels. however, high tsa concentrations  repress transcription controlled by endogenous coactivators more than 90%, which exogenous src- <dig>  is able to reverse. these data support the conclusion that in hela cells, promoter hyperacetylation suppresses coactivator recruitment to dna-bound pr. additionally, we noted that high concentrations of tsa stabilize pr-b protein levels , and prevent ligand-dependent pr-b downregulation . suppression of unliganded and/or liganded pr protein turnover would also impede transcription  <cit> .

the relationship between hdac inhibition and pr desumoylation was therefore probed using low  tsa concentrations together with the desumoylase senp <dig>  hela cells were transfected with wild-type pr-b  or the prb k388r mutant  in the absence  or presence  of senp <dig>  and/or tsa . on wild-type pr-b, either tsa alone or senp <dig> alone caused the expected increase in transcription. the two together were additive, suggesting a lack of interaction between them. on the k388r sumoylation-deficient mutant, tsa was especially potent in hyperactivating the already strong basal activity. senp <dig>  as expected, had no effect on this basal activity. when combined with tsa, senp <dig> also had no effect, suggesting that hdac activity does not markedly contribute to transcription synergy.

discussion
sumo-dependent transcriptional repression and synergy
various regulators of sumo-dependent transcriptional repression have been proposed, which include chromatin-associated proteins  <cit> , histone deacetylases  <cit> , the sumo-binding death-domain associated protein daxx  <cit> , the dead-box protein dp- <dig>  <cit> , and the nuclear matrix protein nxp- <dig>  <cit> . the link between relief from sumoylation and transcriptional synergy on complex promoters was first observed for gr  <cit>  and later expanded to other transcription factors including the nuclear receptors ar, mr and pr  <cit> , and transcription factors like c/ebp, sf <dig>  mitf and zbp <dig>  <cit> . grs are modified post-translationally at three consensus sumo conjugation sites, two in the n-terminus, one in the lbd  <cit> . mutation of both n-terminal sites strongly enhances gr-dependent transcription on dual hormone response elements , but not on the mmtv-ltr  <cit> . these two n-terminal gr sites, dubbed "synergy control motifs"  <cit> , require an intact receptor lbd and an engaged dbd dimerization interface. holmstorm et al.  <cit>  propose that stable binding of sumoylated gr to multiple hres allows recruitment of inhibitory factors, but that on non-canonical half-site elements such as the mmtv-ltr, sumoylated gr escape these negative influences  <cit> . consistent with these observations, we observe that the single n-terminal pr sumoylation motif controls transcriptional synergy on multiple pres but not at a single pre  <cit>  or the mmtv-ltr .

like gr, ar are sumoylated at two n-terminal lys residues and mutation of one  enhances cooperativity on palindromic but not direct-repeat hres. callevaert et al.  <cit>  posit that this is a reflection of differing ar dimer conformations on the two types of dna binding sites. the dbd dimer interface of steroid receptors stabilizes binding to palindromic hres but this structure forms only after the receptors have bound to dna  <cit> . this interface is essential for transcriptional activity on a single hre, so that mutations in either mr or gr that destabilize it, disrupt receptor/dna interactions. however, paradoxically these same dimer interface mutations markedly increase synergistic activity of receptors bound to multiple hres while only modestly increasing dna binding . mutations in prs that destabilize the dbd dimer interface also disrupt receptor binding and activity at a single pre  <cit> , while the same mutations dramatically enhance pr transcriptional activity on promoters containing multiple pres . these mutants are still subject to sumoylation however , suggesting that, as previously reported for gr  <cit> , sumoylation is upstream of synergy control. liu et al.  postulate that an inhibitory interaction between the n-terminus and the wild-type dbd dimer interface is relieved by dbd mutations, thereby promoting cooperative binding among multimeric receptors and/or coregulatory factors. we speculate that this inhibitory factor is the 97aa sumo peptide bound at the n-terminus. its removal, by mutation of the sumoylation motif or enzymatically with senp <dig>  relieves the inhibition and permits assembly of higher order pr complexes on dna.

desumoylation by senp
the senps deconjugate sumo-modified proteins and are critical for maintaining physiological ratios of sumoylated to desumoylated substrates. studies in knockout mice demonstrate that a fine balance of sumoylation/desumoylation is required for normal embryonic development  <cit> . this balance may be altered in malignancies. persistent elevation of senp <dig> facilitates the transformation of the normal prostate to a dysplastic state in transgenic mice. increased senp expression is observed in malignancies including oncocytic thyroid adenomas, colon and prostate cancers  <cit> . remarkably this control by sumoylation is maintained despite the fact that usually, < 5% of target proteins are covalently modified .

senp <dig> stimulates the transcriptional activity of ars and two different mechanisms have been proposed. cheng et al.  <cit>  suggest that the transactivating effects of senp <dig> do not involve sumo deconjugation of the receptors, but rather cleavage of sumo from hdac <dig> thereby alleviated its repressive effect on ar activity. in contrast, kaikkonen et al.  <cit>  demonstrate that effects of senp <dig> and senp <dig> require intact sumo acceptor sites in ar, indicating that the coactivating effects of the enzymes are directly on the receptors. we show here that both senp <dig> and senp <dig> stimulate the transcriptional activity of exogenous pr in hela cells , and endogenous pr in t47dco cells . this stimulatory effect is dependent on their enzymatic activity , requires an intact pr sumo conjugation site , and functions only at promoters containing multiple pres . to test if senp <dig> influences pr activity indirectly, we used the hdac inhibitor tsa. inhibition of hdac activity by tsa did not prevent senp <dig> stimulation of wild-type pr . sumoylation-deficient pr were similarly affected by tsa, indicating that other mechanisms are responsible for the suppressive effects of sumoylation on pr activity. this is in agreement with a recent report showing that wild type and sumoylation deficient ar are similarly influenced by tsa  <cit> . taken together we conclude that senps target the pr sumoylation site synergy control function.

pr phosphorylation and sumoylation
both pr sumoylation and pr phosphorylation are enhanced with similar kinetics by progestin binding to the receptors  <cit> . however, these two posttranslational protein modification steps appear to be independent of one another. we have shown that k <dig> sumoylation of prs, previously mutated at their mapk-targeted, progestin-dependent ser294/344/ <dig> phosphorylation sites, is comparable to sumoylation of wild-type prs  <cit> . on the other hand, activation of mapk signaling by overexpressing mekk <dig> has complex, concentration-dependent effects on pr sumoylation. at low concentrations, mekk <dig> induces ligand-independent pr sumoylation  and increases basal pr-dependent transcription . at high concentrations, mekk <dig> suppresses hormone-dependent pr sumoylation . these contrasting dual activities of mekk <dig> suggest that the effects of mapk on pr sumoylation are indirect, through alteration of the activity of the general sumoylation machinery. the molecular mechanisms by which mapk signaling could indirectly influence pr sumoylation include changes in the amounts and/or the activities of e <dig> ligases and cleaving enzymes  <cit> . in concert with our conclusions, kaikkonen et al.  <cit>  recently showed that ar phosphorylation has no effects on ar sumoylation. indeed, there are no phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motifs in either ar or pr. that pr phosphorylation at s <dig> does not affect pr sumoylation is consistent with our data showing that there are no significant differences between the transcriptional activities of wild-type pr and an s294a pr mutant . qiu et al.  <cit>  have shown similarly robust transcription with a pr s294a mutant. in contrast, daniel et al.  <cit>  concluded that an association does exist between hormone-dependent pr phosphorylation and pr sumoylation. the reasons for these differences are unclear but may be related to experimental conditions including use of dna concentrations for receptor expression at which squelching effects are observed  <cit> .

in contrast to the stimulatory effects of senp <dig> on pr activity , the effect of mapk signaling on pr transcriptional activity is not related directly to the desumoylase effect seen at high concentration . first, mekk <dig> enhanced hormone independent pr activity . second, constitutively active nt-b cannot be sumoylated, but can still be activated by mekk <dig> . third, although sumoylation has no effect on the mmtv promoter , mekk enhances pr dependent activity on this promoter . taken together, our results suggest that the effects of mekk do not depend on modulation of pr sumoylation.

acetylation and sumoylation
acetylation of steroid receptors results in either transcriptional activation or repression, depending on alterations in dna binding affinities, coregulator recruitment, or hormone responsiveness  <cit> . acetylation and sumoylation can in theory compete for the same lys residue of some proteins  <cit> . in response to hormones, prs are acetylated at a lys-rich kxkk motif  conserved in other steroid receptors, and located in the c-terminal hinge region  <cit> . however, for pr, a lys to arg mutation of these residues does not influence n-terminal sumoylation  <cit> . we show that senp <dig> does not influence the transcriptional activity of dbd-lbd  which contains the acetylation motif , suggesting dissociation between hinge region acetylation and desumoylation.

it has been suggested that sumoylation represses transcription by recruiting repressors, including hdac to sumoylated substrates  <cit> . however, the transcriptional activities of wild-type and sumoylation-deficient mutant prs are both increased by the hdac inhibitor tsa , suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible for inhibition of pr activity by sumoylation. effects of tsa depend on the concentration used and the cell type analyzed  <cit> . indeed, low concentrations  of tsa enhance pr transcriptional activity  as previously reported  <cit> . they also promote pr acetylation  <cit> . however, the effects of tsa on transcription are not related to receptor acetylation since an acetylation-deficient pr-b mutant retains heightened transcriptional activity  <cit> . on the other hand, at high concentrations  tsa markedly inhibits pr transcriptional activity , and enhances protein stability . these results are in agreement with studies showing that tsa increases er acetylation as well as protein stability without affecting er transcript levels  <cit> . the inhibitory effect of high tsa levels on pr activity may in part be due to failed ligand dependent downregulation , and in part to inhibition of coactivator expression and/or assembly. as we show in figure 7c, overexpression of src <dig> relieves tsa inhibition in a dose dependent manner.

CONCLUSIONS
prs are major markers in breast cancer. their presence indicates that a tumor is hormone-dependent and a candidate for endocrine therapies. the role of progesterone in activating these transcription factors is complex, however. after binding pr, progestin agonists and antagonists can have either transcriptional activating or suppressive effects modulated in part by enhancing or suppressing pr sumoylation  <cit> . this study defines the roles of the sumo-specific senp proteases and sumoylation on pr-dependent transcriptional synergy.  <dig>  we show that desumoylation by senp <dig> enhances transcriptional synergism in a promoter-specific manner.  <dig>  we also show that senps, through their catalytic activity, act at the single k <dig> pr sumoylation site, which if mutated eliminates transcriptional synergism by senps.  <dig>  the enzymes can act only on hormone-bound full-length prs and increase the ligand sensitivity of the receptors.  <dig>  sumoylation effects on pr transcriptional synergism are dissociable from receptor phosphorylation, src- <dig> coactivation or recruitment of hdacs to the promoter. we conclude that reversible sumoylation/desumoylation of a minor pr protein subpopulation tightly controls the overall transcriptional activity of the receptors at complex synthetic promoters. of note we previously showed a requirement for pr sumoylation to transrepress er thereby altering tumor responses to estrogens  <cit> . taken together, our data suggest that the pr sumo modification pathway critically modifies the response of a tumor to estrogens, progestins and antiprogestins--hormones that are major therapeutics for breast cancers.
