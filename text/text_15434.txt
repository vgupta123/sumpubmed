BACKGROUND
we have previously described the single sequencing reaction  protocol for assessment of a known polymorphism in the 3'utr region of cyp <dig>   <cit> . here we have extended and optimized the use of the method for multiple polymorphisms in the nat <dig> gene. the increasing number of detected mutations in the nat <dig>  makes genotyping using conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism  or allele-specific amplification complicated. we developed a rapid and universal strategy based on single-track dna sequencing analysis of a unique pcr product encompassing the entire nat <dig> coding region  along with the flanking 5' and 3' untranslated regions. it allows a rapid and economic characterization of nat <dig> alleles. our method brings reproducible results on both alf express™  and abi <dig> prism sequencing instruments and may be adopted for majority of epidemiological studies with relevance of nat <dig> in environmentally related diseases.

n-acetyltransferases  are implicated in the biotransformation of primary arylamines , heterocyclic amines, hydrazines, and their n-hydroxylated metabolites present in tobacco smoke and food  <cit> . an increased activity for p-aminobenzoic acid acetylation  was observed in the breast malignant tissues compared to benign and control tissues  <cit> . human nats may have adapted a common catalytic mechanism from cysteine proteases for acetyl-transfer reactions  <cit> . the nat <dig> gene is highly polymorphic . expression of nat1* <dig> but not nat1* <dig> and nat1* <dig> caused a 2-fold decrease in the amount and catalytic activity of nat <dig> in cos- <dig> cell cytosol  <cit> . all available data suggest that slow nat <dig> phenotype results from nat <dig> allelic variants that encode reduced expression of nat <dig> and/or less-stable nat <dig> protein  <cit> .

epidemiological studies suggest that the nat <dig> and nat <dig> acetylation polymorphisms modify the risk of developing urinary bladder, colorectal, breast, head and neck, lung, and possibly prostate cancers  <cit> . interactions between nat2* <dig> and nat1* <dig> were suggested by the increased frequency of the nat2*4/nat1* <dig> haplotype  <cit> . the individual risks associated with nat <dig> acetylator phenotypes/genotypes are usually small, but they increase when considered in conjunction with other susceptibility genes and/or aromatic and heterocyclic amine carcinogen exposures. because of the relatively high frequency of the variant nat <dig> genotypes in the population, the attributable cancer risk may be high. large-scale molecular epidemiological studies that investigate the role of nat <dig> genotypes and/or phenotypes together with other genetic susceptibility gene polymorphisms and biomarkers of carcinogen exposure are necessary to expand our current understanding of the role of nat <dig> acetylation polymorphisms in cancer risk  <cit> .

RESULTS
we outlined a strategy allowing to address simultaneously  <dig> genetic variants in the coding area of nat <dig> with two sequencing tracks: a and g and  <dig> variants in the 3' flanking area with two tracks: a and t . using single-track sequencing of the nat <dig> coding region, we have detected  <dig> individuals carrying polymorphisms at site t640g, which characterizes nat1* <dig> alleles . identical results were obtained when performing the single-track sequencing on an alf express™ system as on abi <dig> prism . the frequency of this polymorphism,  <dig>  found by single-track sequencing in our study was comparable to the frequency  <dig>  found by pcr-rflp method in  <dig> german control individuals  <cit> . polymorphisms t1088a and c1095a  were in perfect linkage disequilibrium. the frequency of these polymorphisms was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively and was comparable to frequency  <dig>  reported by bruhn et al.  <cit> .

a-track sequencing of the 3'-untranslated region of nat <dig> revealed a deletion of taataataa . it was found in  <dig> individuals accounting for the frequency  <dig> , which is comparable to the frequency  <dig>  observed in the study on  <dig> control individuals by bruhn et al.  <cit> . this change is also unique for the nat1* <dig> alleles and co-segregates with t640g polymorphism. very good co-segregation of t640g and 1067-1090deltaataataa polymorphisms in  <dig> informative samples was observed . despite the different chemistry, figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> demonstrate perfect concordance between the results obtained by alf express™ and abi <dig> prism analysis, verified on samples with previously characterized genotypes by rflp.

discussion
a modified automated dna sequencing with a fluorescent label was used to genotype pcr products spanning through the whole nat <dig> gene by single-track sequencing reactions in  <dig> control individuals. previously, we have shown that single-track sequencing reactions performed on pcr products, with subsequent analysis on an alf express™ dna sequencer, can be as informative, sensitive, and accurate as complete sequencing reactions but more economical option for the genotyping of known polymorphisms in the human aromatase gene  <cit> . compared to analysis by full gel-based sequencing, four times more samples can be analyzed per gel in considerably shorter time. the method could be particularly efficient in cases of high density of polymorphic sites residing in a common area as in the case of nat <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this paper shows that single-track sequencing reactions can be used as a tool for screening for all types of known polymorphisms in field laboratories with limited or overloaded sequence capacity. compared to standard sequencing, this single track sequencing may have better signal to noise ratio. this approach is time and cost effective and can be accommodated for high-throughput analyses in epidemiology studies.
