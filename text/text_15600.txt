BACKGROUND
the bacterial class, clostridia, is typified by gram-positive anaerobes and includes several important human pathogens. the main virulence factors produced by pathogenic clostridia are secreted toxins. while c. botulinum  and c. tetani  are the best known of these pathogens, other members, in particular c. difficile, have become increasingly notorious due to an accelerating number of documented infections in recent years. in north america and europe, c. difficile infection  is now the leading cause of infectious diarrhea . cdi can cause a varying range of diseases from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis and death . the primary risk factors of cdi include antibiotic treatment, advanced age, severe underlying illness, prior hospitalization, tube feeding, gastrointestinal surgery, and use of proton-pump inhibitors  <cit> . c. difficile also has a broad host range and causes infection in agriculturally important animals such as pigs, cattle, horses and chickens .

recent studies on the clostridium genus support a reclassification of c. difficile and the related cluster xi into a family-level group that is distinct from the current clostridiaceae family   <cit> . along with c. difficile, cluster xi currently includes several clinically significant members, c. sordellii, filifactor alocis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius . c. sordellii infection , although not as prevalent as cdi, has a very high mortality rate that can often reach 75 % lethality  <cit> . both c. sordellii and c. difficile are asymptomatically carried in the gastrointestinal tracts of about 10 % of adult humans  <cit>  and both species also can infect animals . in addition, c. sordellii and c. difficile excrete potent toxins with immunological cross-reactivity and similar biological activities  <cit> . despite the close similarities in host range and virulence factors, there are two striking differences between c. difficile and c. sordellii. first is that while c. difficile only colonizes the gastrointestinal tract, c. sordellii can colonize both the human gastrointestinal tract and vagina  <cit> . secondly, while c. difficile infection affects the host intestine, c. sordellii primarily causes soft tissue infection. the tissue preference of c. sordellii results in csi being primarily reported among reproductive-age women following natural childbirth, spontaneous, surgical or medical abortions  <cit> . wounds from illicit injectable drug use, non-gynecological surgical procedures, penetrating crushing injuries, or traumatic injury in previously healthy men, women, and children can also lead to csi infection .

comparative analyses of closely related bacteria with different infection site specificity and pathogenicity can provide information relevant to understanding adaptation to host environments and mechanisms of infection. genomic differences can lead to phenotype level changes. in bacteria, phenotypic variations are often related to metabolic changes, which are defined by the ability to utilize various sources of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous, and other essential nutrients. with the development of phenotype microarrays , high-throughput determination of a microorganism’s global metabolic phenotype or phenome is now possible . in this study, to determine the genomic and phenomic basis for the differences in c. sordellii and c. difficile infections, we have performed a comparative genomic and phenomic analysis of these two species. the global phenome of c. sordellii and c. difficile revealed several differences, most notably in acid resistant growth. we further explored the genomic basis for phenomic differences by determining a draft genome sequence of c. sordellii strain  <dig> and comparing it against two c. sordellii genomes  and eight c. difficile genomes . understanding the differential adaptions to host tissue at the genomic and phenomic level should provide opportunities in the fight against these important infections.

RESULTS
nutritional phenomic comparison
in this study, we have performed the comparative analysis of the genome and phenome of the two closely related clostridial pathogens, c. sordellii and c. difficile. to determine the global phenome of c. sordellii and c. difficile, we used biolog phenotype microarrays  which enable whole cellular level determination of bacterial phenotypes  <cit> . the nutritional pm analysis consisted of  <dig> assays of carbon source metabolism,  <dig> assays of phosphorous and sulfur source metabolism,  <dig> assays of biosynthetic pathways, and  <dig> assays of nitrogen source metabolism  <cit> . we have previously analyzed the phenome of six c. difficile strains  <cit> . we compared those results with phenome of c. sordellii strain  <dig> determined in this study. from a total of  <dig> nutritional phenotype assays,  <dig> were positive  for c. sordellii strain  <dig>  while  <dig> were positive for c. difficile strain  <dig> . c. sordellii and c. difficile shared  <dig> positive phenotypes while  <dig> positive phenotypes were specific to just one of the two species. a disproportionate number of unshared phenotypes were identified in the carbon and nitrogen source assays . the unshared carbon and nitrogen phenotypes are indicative of species specific adaptations to environmentally available nutrient sources.

a basic illustration of the carbon source preference exhibited by each species is depicted in a table listing all  <dig> positive carbon phenotype conditions . a c. sordellii to c. difficile ratio of growth enhancement was used to more directly compare the ability of the two species to utilize specific carbon sources . the tested carbon source phenotypes were grouped based on the type of carbon source molecules. c. difficile more effectively utilized typical carbohydrates, while c. sordellii was better able to utilize non-carbohydrates, including amino acids and fatty acids, as carbon sources. carbon sources grouped as carbohydrates were further divided into molecular sub-types resulting in a similar trend. most typical saccharides could be utilized more effectively by c. difficile than by c. sordellii, yet saccharides that have been modified for incorporation into nucleic acids or phosphorylated for entering in metabolic pathways can be more easily utilized by c. sordellii. the difference in ability to exploit a broad range of non-carbohydrate molecules as carbon sources could improve the likelihood of c. sordellii to survive within the more complex environment of soft tissue.fig.  <dig> carbon source utilization microarray. a the list includes all positive carbon source phenotypes  for c. sordellii and c. difficile . negative phenotypes are red. b the c. sordellii : c. difficile ratio of growth enhancement for each carbon source phenotype  is grouped by carbon source type. the average for each group is indicated . the carbohydrate group was further divided into sub-types



figures 2a and 2b list all  <dig> positive nitrogen and peptide nitrogen source phenotype conditions, respectively. the positive phenotype threshold for nitrogen source growth enhancement was achieved for more than 2× as many simple nitrogen source conditions by c. difficile than by c. sordellii; however, c. sordellii was able to reach the positive phenotype threshold for nearly 2× as many peptide nitrogen conditions as c. difficile. for example, c. difficile could better utilize the simple amino alcohol, ethanolamine, which is an abundant nitrogen source in the gut. as c. sordellii was better able to utilize protein building blocks as carbon sources, the fact that this preference extends to nitrogen sources is not surprising. a c. sordellii to c. difficile ratio of growth enhancement was used to compare nitrogen source utilization between the two species for the  <dig> di-peptide nitrogen source phenotypes. the ratios were grouped by the presence of amino acids in the di-peptide sources and organized into higher level groupings by their expected catabolic pathway leading to nitrogen metabolism as defined by available kegg pathway enzymes  <cit>  in the c. sordellii genome . because the di-peptide nitrogen source microarray was not comprehensive, the amino acid sample size was variable. for most amino acids, data was obtained from between  <dig> and  <dig> di-peptide conditions. ratios for asparagine , glutamine , and threonine  trended similarly to amino acids within the same grouping. the sample size for cysteine di-peptides  was small and only incorporated glycine, but interestingly the growth ratio was strongly dependent on amino acid position. analysis of only the first amino acid was also included in fig. 2c since the distributions were generally narrower than when both amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig> were included. amino acids in group i are likely to follow a pathway that generates pyruvic acid when ammonia is liberated as a nitrogen source . the largest bias for c. sordellii growth enhancement was observed for group i amino acids: glycine, serine, and threonine which are linked to the same pathway. the other notable amino acid group  contains aspartic acid and asparagine, which are catabolized to oxaloacetate, and are more effectively utilized by c. difficile than by c. sordellii. in comparison to c. difficile, c. sordellii has adapted to the broader use of available peptides  as nutrient sources, which could help c. sordellii infiltrate soft tissue.fig.  <dig> nitrogen source utilization microarray. the lists include all positive simple  and di- and tri-peptide  nitrogen source phenotypes  for c. sordellii and c. difficile . negative phenotypes are red . the c. sordellii : c. difficile ratio of growth enhancement for each dipeptide nitrogen source phenotype is grouped by amino acid . gray circles indicate the position  <dig> amino acid  while white circles indicate the position  <dig> amino acid. amino acids are further grouped  by their expected pathway to nitrogen metabolism 



our analysis finds that, at the phenome level, both of these closely related species share a core group of functions and phenotypes. our phenotype array results also reveal some key phenotype differences particularly for carbon and nitrogen source utilization that might explain the differences in the primary site of infections caused by these two species. both glycolysis and amino acid catabolism are differentially regulated in c. difficile suggesting a possible mechanism for how these pathways have evolved to better occupy the respective niche for both c. sordellii and c. difficile  <cit> .

osmolyte and ph phenomic comparison
two additional pm arrays were utilized for osmolyte and ph sensitivity . optimum growth was obtained at ph  <dig>  for c. difficile. an analysis of ph-dependent growth normalized to growth at ph  <dig>  for each species revealed that c. sordellii also achieved near-optimal growth levels at ph  <dig>  . further, c. sordellii performed better than c. difficile at off-optimal growth phs. at ph  <dig> , growth of c. sordellii is 2× as robust as c. difficile relative to growth at ph  <dig> . because the normal, healthy ph of the vagina is ph  <dig>  or lower, the ability of c. sordellii to grow at acidic ph plays a crucial role in facilitating vaginal infections  <cit> . fecal contamination of the vagina during vaginal delivery could provide a source of organisms that may infect vaginal tears, episiotomy sites or ascend to the uterus through the open cervix  <cit> . interestingly, c. sordellii was able to maintain similar growth levels from ph  <dig> through ph  <dig> while the growth of c. difficile was modestly reduced above ph  <dig> suggesting that c. sordellii has an improved survivability at both acidic and basic phs.fig.  <dig> growth dependence on ph. phenotype microarray growth data for the ph range 4– <dig> was obtained from pm10-a . for each species, the data was normalized to ph  <dig>  which is the optimal growth ph of c. difficile




c. difficile showed better adaptation to growth under 78 % of osmolyte conditions; however, c. sordellii had a growth advantage over c. difficile in 83 % of urea-specific conditions. the combination of low ph and urea led to a > 40 % growth enhancement for c. sordellii over ph  <dig>  conditions while the same combination inhibited growth in c. difficile by > 40 % relative to optimal growth at ph  <dig> . c. sordellii has previously been shown to exhibit urease activity  <cit> . details on the c. sordellii urease gene cluster and its implications for growth improvement under multiple conditions including acidic ph are discussed in the later sections.

phylogeny
clostridium species have been classified into different phylogenetic groups with c. sordellii and c. difficile belonging to clostridial cluster xi  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> orthologous genes with greater than 90 % bootstrap support were identified and used to infer phylogenetic relationships of  <dig> bacterial species from clostridial clusters i, xi, xii, and xiii. the phylogenetic tree inferred from a concatenation of the  <dig> genes  agreed with and further confirmed the ribosomal proteins-based phylogeny reported in a previous study  <cit> , placing clostridium acidurici  as a sister group of anaerococcus prevotii and finegoldia magna , joined by the cluster xi , and finally clostridium perfringens  as an outgroup. the concatenation phylogeny demonstrated that the majority  of genes supported the monophyly of the clade of c. sordellii and c. difficile, suggesting that c. sordellii is a sister group to c. difficile.fig.  <dig> phylogeny. maximum likelihood tree obtained from a concatenated nucleotide sequence alignment of the  <dig> orthologous genes of the  <dig> bacterial species from clostridial clusters i, xi, xii, and xiii. the horizontal bar at the base of the figure represents  <dig>  substitutions per nucleotide site. the percentages of genes that support the branches of the tree are indicated



gene repertoire
species with similar gene contents should have similar functional potential as a whole  <cit> . whole gene contents of any genome can be the result of a mixture of different evolutionary events such as vertical inheritance of genes and their duplication, gain and loss events, and their relative contributions may vary among different species  <cit> . the  <dig>  proteins from the  <dig> bacterial species from clostridial clusters i, xi, xii, and xiii were classified into  <dig> homologous groups or protein families. of the  <dig> protein families,  <dig> were present in a single strain,  <dig> were present in two or more strains, of which  <dig> were shared by all the strains.

cluster analysis of the  <dig> genomes based on the whole gene content using four agglomeration methods  produced four distinct trees , which were all incongruent with the concatenation phylogeny . previous studies also reported that whole gene contents of bacteria do not strictly follow their phylogenetic relationships  and can lead to a distorted ancestral lineage  <cit> . although all four gene-content trees were topologically distinct and none matched the topology of the concatenation phylogeny, c. sordellii and c. difficile ubiquitously formed a single cluster . because all four gene-content trees suggest that c. sordellii and c. difficile are more similar to one another than to any other species, a comparison of the genomic differences might provide useful information regarding their important clinical differences.fig.  <dig> whole gene content. trees constructed by cluster analysis of the  <dig> clostridial species based on whole gene content using four agglomeration methods: single-linkage a, complete-linkage b, average-linkage c, and neighbour-joining d clustering. clusters formed by all four methods are identified



a total of  <dig> protein families were present in c. sordellii and c. difficile but absent in the other  <dig> species. the protein families included stage iii sporulation protein af, flagellar protein fliz, and k+-transporting atpase subunits a  and c . a total of  <dig> protein families were present in c. sordellii and c. difficile but absent in the other  <dig> species  in the cluster xi. within the cluster xi, genome size and the number of protein-coding sequences  were larger in c. sordellii  and c. difficile  than in the  <dig> other species , while genome g + c content of c. sordellii  and c. difficile  were lower than those of the other  <dig> species  . our results suggest that c. sordellii and c. difficile increased their genome size and/or the other cluster xi lineages  decreased their genome size after divergence from the common ancestor of cluster xi. the larger genome size of c. difficile and c. sordellii relative to other members of cluster xi may be linked to their unique set of shared genes.fig.  <dig> clostridial genome size. for the  <dig> clostridial species analyzed, the number of protein-coding sequences  are correlated with genome size . the percentage of g + c  is negatively correlated with genome size and is plotted on an inverted axis. the  <dig> members of clostridial cluster xi are identified



gene repertoire comparison between c. sordellii and c. difficile
we compared the gene repertoire between eight c. difficile strains  and three c. sordellii strains . proteins from the  <dig> strains were classified into  <dig> homologous groups ; . of the  <dig> protein families,  <dig> were present in a single strain,  <dig> were present in two or more strains, of which  <dig> were shared by all the strains.

we performed gene set enrichment analysis to examine over- and underrepresented functional categories in c. sordellii relative to c. difficile . we calculated the odds ratio  to rank the relative overrepresentation  and underrepresentation  of each functional category, and p-value of fisher’s exact test. fig.  <dig> shows the or values of seed subsystems as examples. the seed subsystem “urea_decomposition” , the gene ontology  term “nickel cation binding ” , and the virulence factors database  keywords “acid resistance”, “colonization”, and “enzyme”  were significantly overrepresented in c. sordellii relative to c. difficile based on fisher’s exact test after false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons .fig.  <dig> gene set enrichment. odds ratio to rank the relative overrepresentation  or underrepresentation  of each seed category in the c. sordellii genome relative to the c. difficile genome



a total of  <dig> protein families were present in all the  <dig> c. sordellii strains but absent in all the  <dig> c. difficile strains . these c. sordellii-specific genes may have been gained on the branch leading to the c. sordellii strain, and could be linked to its specific environmental adaptation and pathogenesis. they included some genes in the pathogenicity locus; i.e., locus_tag ws9_ <dig> to ws9_ <dig> in strain  <dig>  h476_ <dig> to h476_ <dig> in strain vpi_ <dig>  and h477_ <dig> to h477_ <dig> for strain atcc_ <dig>  <cit> . they included several amino acid decarboxylases and deaminases  that might enable c. sordellii to grow on peptide nutrient sources in soft tissue. in addition, glutamate decarboxylase and arginine deiminase  produce alkaline byproducts that have been suggested to participate in the acid resistance of gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  and improve c. sordellii growth in acidic environments. two protein families annotated as “kup system potassium uptake protein ” and “potassium voltage-gated channel shab-related subfamily b member  <dig> ” were present in c. sordellii strains but absent in c. difficile strains. proteins involved in potassium transport often play a role in adaptive ph tolerance  <cit>  and may increase broad ph range survival in c. sordellii.

seed subsystems
the seed annotation engine defines genes associated with a functional role in a bacterial genome as a subsystem  <cit> . a seed subsystem is termed as a generalization of the term “pathway” and is a convenient framework for functional comparisons of bacterial genomes  <cit> . of the  <dig> protein families,  <dig> were assigned to the seed subsystems . both c. sordellii and c. difficile contained some of the important functions relevant to strain transmission and colonization. for example, both species contained  <dig> protein families assigned to “dormancy and sporulation” including sporulation sigma factor. genes related to spore coat  are present in both c. difficile and c. sordellii genomes. this is consistent with the previous reports on c. difficile and c. sordellii spore properties  <cit> . of the  <dig> protein families assigned to “iron acquisition and metabolism”, hemerythrin-like iron-binding protein was present in c. sordellii but absent in c. difficile. iron acquisition is essential for growth of pathogenic bacteria during soft tissue infections  <cit>  and is likely to be important for c. sordellii in proliferating in host tissues. it has been shown that stickland metabolism is important in c. difficile physiology  <cit> . in c. difficile, several genes located in d-proline reductase operon and glycine reductase operon are involved in stickland associated metabolism. when c. sordellii genomes were compared to c. difficile genomes, most genes in the prd  and grd  operons were found to be conserved.

virulence factors database 
we used the virulence factors database   <cit>  to assess the presence of virulence genes in the c. sordellii and c. difficile strains . toxins a  and b  were homologous, and the homologous proteins were present in all the  <dig> genomes of c. difficile and c. sordellii. for strain atcc_ <dig>  locus_tag h477_ <dig>  is annotated as toxin a, and h477_ <dig>  is annotated as “toxin b”. for vpi_ <dig>  locus_tag h476_ <dig>  and h476_ <dig>  are annotated as toxin b  <cit> . in the strain c. sordellii  <dig> locus tags ws9_ <dig> to ws9_ <dig> corresponds to toxin b and locus tag ws9_ <dig> correspond to toxin a. however, c. sordellii being a draft genomes, the locus tags in c. sordellii strains vpi_ <dig> and  <dig> represent partial sequence of the toxin genes.

four protein families homologous to collagenase , sialidase , perfringolysin o , and phospholipase c , respectively, from c. perfringens were present in c. sordellii but absent in c. difficile. at the genome level, c. sordellii contains genes encoding enzymes for host tissue lysis and nutrient release during infection   <cit> . the presence of these enzymes coupled with the ability to metabolize a larger set of peptides is likely to be a contributing factor in the ability of c. sordellii to cause lethal soft tissue infections. in addition, a cluster of eight genes encoding urease subunits , ureb  and urec ) and urease accessory proteins  homologous to known virulence factors of helicobacter pylori  <dig>  were present in c. sordellii but absent in c. difficile.

clusters of orthologous groups 
the clusters of orthologous groups  database  <cit>  defines four major functional categories: “information storage and processing”, “cellular processes and signaling”, “metabolism”, and “poorly characterized”, which are further subdivided into  <dig> functional categories. of the  <dig> protein families,  <dig> were assigned to the cog functional categories . the  <dig> protein families were assigned to cog functional category e , of which  <dig> protein families were present in c. sordellii but absent in c. difficile . c. sordellii can better metabolize dipeptides than c. difficile as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  several c. sordellii protein families including abc-type transport systems for dipeptides or amino acid, a variety of peptidases, and amino acid degradation enzymes could be responsible. a c. sordellii l-serine deaminase might facilitate not only improved utilization of serine as a nitrogen source but also improved glycine and threonine metabolism within the di-peptide analysis. a branched chain amino acid aminotransferase from c. sordellii might explain the improved metabolism of isoleucine and valine. the abundance in amino acid associated functions are consistent with our finding in the phenotype level that c. sordellii has more capacity to use a wider range of amino acids and peptides as nutrient sources than c. difficile.table  <dig> protein families assigned to cog functional category e  that are present in c. sordellii strain  <dig> but absent in c. difficile strain 630



urease gene cluster in environmental adaptation
historically, a high level of urease activity has been used in the positive taxonomic identification of c. sordellii, although a number of urease-negative c. sordellii isolates have been identified  <cit> . a cluster of eight genes in c. sordellii strain  <dig> was found to encode urease subunits: urea , ureb , urec , urei, uree, uref, ureg, and ureh . the organization of the urease gene cluster is similar to that of helicobacter sp.  <cit> , yet the entire gene cluster was absent in c. difficile. homologues to the eight urease genes are also present in c. perfringens; however, several of these urease genes are positioned on a large plasmid  <cit> . the set of urease proteins play an important function in acid resistance while also contributing a significant nitrogen source  <cit> . urea , ureb , and urec  form the core urease complex involved in conversion of urea to ammonia and carbonic acid  <cit> . cytoplasmic urease activity substantially increases the intracellular ph and is essential for survival of many acidophilic pathogens including helicobacter pylori. the proteins in the c. sordellii urease complex are highly homologous to c. perfringens and h. pylori  and share the highest degree of conservation near the enzyme active site . urei forms a urea channel that allows efficient entrance of urea into the cytoplasm for urease degradation  <cit> . urei is also homologous to c. perfringens and h. pylori with a high degree of conservation for residues lining the pore . the relatedness of proteins from the c. sordellii urease gene cluster to other pathogen urease proteins  suggests a similar role in low ph tolerance . in addition, urea is a byproduct of protein degradation creating a potential nitrogen source during infection. the two major phenotypes that provide c. sordellii the opportunity to colonize the vagina and soft tissue are the ability to survive below ph  <dig>  and to utilize peptides as nitrogen sources. these two functions likely make the urease gene cluster important in establishing and maintaining c. sordellii infections. future studies directed at disrupting the c. sordellii urease gene cluster  should better define the gene cluster’s role in the low ph tolerance exhibited by c. sordellii.fig.  <dig> urease gene cluster. a the size and organization of c. sordellii urease genes is illustrated. overall homology of individual proteins to  h. pylori and  c. perfringens is depicted by colored bars for  % similarity and  % identity located below each gene. the scale is defined with red > 90 % and cyan < 20 %. b the urease enzyme structure from h. pylori   <cit>  and the urea channel structure from h. pylori   <cit>  are both shown to illustrate the degree of conservation with corresponding c. sordellii urease proteins near the functional sites. using the same scale for a, residues colored in red are conserved across h. pylori, c. perfringens and c. sordellii, while residues colored in cyan are not conserved

fig.  <dig> possible mechanisms of acid adaptation. several c. sordellii genes could be utilized to sequester protons and improve the internal and surrounding ph. a the expected contributions of urease, glutamate decarboxylase, and arginine deiminase to increasing the cytoplasmic ph under acidic conditions are depicted. b the nhaa na+/h+ antiporter is expected to improve alkaline adaptation



other genes involved in environmental stress tolerance
several other c. sordellii genes that are absent from c. difficile could play a role in adaptation to acidic conditions . glutamate decarboxylase converts glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid  which absorbs a proton during the reaction. arginine deiminase generates ammonia which can also absorb a proton and create a more alkaline internal, periplasmic, or local ph in an acidic environment. some bacteria can accumulate high cytoplasmic potassium levels under acidic stress. potassium transport is expected to play a role in adaptation to acidic environments by maintaining the membrane potential for optimum bioenergetics homeostasis  <cit> , yet the exact mechanism of how the various transporters and channels work together to support the internal ph is not fully understood. potassium homeostasis is also pivotal in the osmotic stress response.

similar growth of c. sordellii strain  <dig> from ph  <dig> to a more alkaline ph range was observed . a homologue of the na+/h+ antiporter, nhaa, was identified in the genome of c. sordellii strains  <dig>  atcc  <dig> and vpi  <dig> but was identified only in c. difficile strain f <dig>  in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, nhaa has been implicated as a mechanism for maintaining internal ph homeostasis under alkaline conditions by catalyzing h+ uptake for a preferred phout range of  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . the presence of nhaa in all c. sordellii strains but absence from most c. difficile strains could explain the ability of c. sordellii to maintain growth levels at high ph . finally, some of the observed phenotypic differences could be multifactorial and related to differences in the gene expression levels of many genes. as is the case with the activation of toxin genes in c. difficile, gene expression levels are likely to be correlated to several components in the bacterium's nutritional environment, such as the presence of sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids .

CONCLUSIONS
the related pathogens, c. difficile and c. sordellii, were compared through the analysis of phenomic and genomic datasets. while c. difficile infections have been well studied, significantly less information regarding c. sordellii infections is available. in particular, the current study focused on uncovering the basis for c. sordellii‘s preference for infecting both soft tissues and the vagina, while not infecting the gastrointestinal tract . a comparison of the phenome between c. difficile and c. sordellii revealed that c. sordellii had adapted to survive under conditions that require the procurement of resources from host tissue. in addition, c. sordellii can withstand more acidic ph than c. difficile thereby allowing it to survive in the low ph environment of the vagina. the complementary genomic analysis revealed a large number of proteins present in c. sordellii but not in c. difficile that are likely to play an adaptive role in metabolism and ph tolerance. in this context, the urease gene cluster is described in detail. the phenomic and genomic comparison between c. difficile and c. sordellii should provide guidance for the development of targeted treatments for clostridial infections.
