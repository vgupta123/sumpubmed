BACKGROUND
many neurodegenerative disorders, such as parkinson's disease, are caused by the impairment or death of neurons in the central nervous system  <cit> . in the future, it is hoped that large numbers of stem cell-derived neurons will be produced in culture with the purpose of being used in clinical applications  <cit> . hampering the faster implementation of the ambitious stem cell therapy technology, there is still the need of efficient, robust and scalable bioprocesses for cell expansion and/or differentiation in vitro.

during the last five years, substantial progress has been made towards this goal  <cit> . stirred suspension systems have been pioneered, by others and ourselves, as a promising in vitro system for stem cell expansion  <cit> , embryoid body cultivation  <cit>  and stem cell differentiation into specific cell types  <cit> . these systems offer attractive advantages of scalability and relative simplicity; stirring provides a more homogenous culture environment and allows the measurement and control of extrinsic factors such as nutrient and cytokine concentration, ph and dissolved oxygen   <cit> .

aiming to improve the yields of specific stem cell stages, several culture parameters have been optimized, including the agitation rate, cell inoculum concentration and medium composition  <cit> , and different culturing approaches have been developed such as the use of microcarrier supports  <cit>  and cell encapsulation  <cit> . perfusion and frequent feeding operation modes have been shown to increase the expansion of mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> , embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and mammary epithelial stem cells  <cit> , without compromising their stem cell performance.

computer-controlled bioreactors are particular advantageous for process development by allowing the online monitoring and control of specific culture parameters , ensuring a fully controlled environment for stem cell cultivation. oxygen-controlled bioreactors have been used for culture of mouse and human esc-derived cardiomyocytes  <cit> . gilbertson et al  <cit>  were the first group to use controlled conditions for neural precursor cell culture as aggregates; the authors report the successful expansion of mouse neural stem cells in  <dig> ml bioreactors  while retaining the cell multilineage potential  <cit> . more recently, this system was applied to the culture of human neural precursor cells  <cit> . the expansion of various human stem cell types in bioreactors under defined and controlled conditions remains to be addressed. future challenges also include the combination of expansion and directed differentiation steps in an integrated bioprocess that will ultimately result in scale-up of well differentiated cells to clinically relevant numbers.

within this context, the present work focused the development of a reproducible scalable system for the production of human neurons derived from expanded and differentiated stem cells. the human embryonal carcinoma cell line ntera-2/cl.d <dig>  was the cellular system used because it is a valuable model for both undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells   <cit>  and human neuronal differentiation in vitro  <cit> . in addition, the neurons derived from this cell line have been successfully used in transplantation studies in several mouse models and in human stroke patients  <cit> , providing also promising material for cell therapy investigations in central nervous system.

herein, undifferentiated nt <dig> cells were cultivated as 3d-aggregates in controlled stirred suspension conditions. in order to improve the yields of stem cells, two parameters were studied:  the inoculum concentration, as it has been shown to be critical in enhancing cell aggregation and culture profile  <cit> , and  the culture operation mode, since it has been demonstrated that the feeding strategy affects cell metabolism and consequently could improve cell culture performance  <cit> . at the end, the expansion of undifferentiated nt <dig> cells, followed by directed neuronal differentiation were integrated in stirred bioreactors with temperature, ph and po <dig> control, in an effort to develop a promising model system for the production of human stem cell derivatives.

RESULTS
with the goal of developing a robust and scalable system for nt <dig> neuronal differentiation, both expansion and differentiation steps were integrated in a fully controlled bioreactor process. firstly, different strategies for expansion of undifferentiated nt <dig> cells as 3-d aggregates were screened in stirred spinner vessels; two parameters were studied  the inoculum concentration and  the culture operation mode, i.e., medium replenishing strategies. having the expansion of pluripotent nt <dig> cells optimized and well characterized, the neuronal differentiation strategy previously developed by our group  <cit> , was integrated and the overall bioprocess combined in the bioreactor. figure  <dig> summarizes the experimental outline used for expansion and differentiation processes.

effect of inoculum concentration in nt <dig> expansion
three different cell inoculum concentrations were tested in batch culture mode, using  <dig> ml spinners:  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> cell/ml .

during the first  <dig> h of sp-1b and sp-4b cultures, cells assembled into small 3d-aggregates  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μm. after this period, cells started to divide and aggregate size increased up to  <dig> μm. the growth curve and the calculated apparent growth rates are shown in figure 2b and table  <dig>  respectively. sp-1b exhibited a high apparent growth rate  and the highest fi in cell concentration . nevertheless, maximum cell density  <dig>   ×  <dig> cell/ml was only reached  <dig> days after inoculation, whereas in sp-4b, a maximum of  <dig>   ×  <dig> cell/ml was achieved at day  <dig>  from day  <dig> onwards of sp-4b culture, cells started to detach from the aggregates , resulting in cell death . similar behavior was observed for sp-1b culture upon day  <dig> of cultivation.

concerning the sp- <dig>  culture, cell aggregates were rare and small throughout cultivation time . in fact, no effective cell growth was observed  and cell viability was low .

aiming to develop an efficient bioprocess for the fast production of human neurons, cell number and culture time were the parameters preferentially used to select the best strategy. for sp-4b, the time needed to achieve xmax was  <dig> times lower than for sp-1b, reaching similar xmax values . based on these results, sp-4b was chosen to be further optimized and integrated with the neuronal differentiation step.

impact of operation mode in nt <dig> cell expansion
in all batch cultures there was a rapid decrease in cell density after the culture reached its maximum concentration value . although no complete depletion of neither glucose nor glutamine was observed , this profile could be correlated to the exhaustion of other essential nutrients and/or the progressive accumulation of toxic metabolic waste products such as lactate and ammonia . in sp-4b, by the 4th day of cultivation, the lactate and ammonia concentrations were already  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively . in sp-1b, these values were also high at day  <dig> of culture .

aiming at prolonging the exponential growth phase and improve the cell expansion, two additional operation modes were tested. the first strategy consisted of a glucose fed-batch operation mode . in this strategy, culture was initiated at low concentration of glucose  and the feeding was performed twice a day assuring the maintenance of low levels of glucose throughout cultivation time . the second strategy  was designed to simulate a perfusion system, in which cells are kept in culture and the media is renovated regularly. this was achieved by performing a daily partial media exchange  from the 3rd cultivation day onwards, as this time point corresponded to the growth peak in the batch culture .

for sp-4me and sp-4fb cultures, the exponential growth phase was extended until day  <dig> , with a significant increase in xmax, when compared to sp-4b . these differences are also reflected in cell metabolism, as shown by the nutrient consumption and metabolite production profiles . the sp-4fb culture presented the lowest specific rates of glucose consumption and lactate production. the lower accumulation of lactate  in sp-4fb contributed to the high apparent growth rate of this strategy . nevertheless, there was still a steeply decrease in cell concentration after day  <dig>  that may result from the accumulation of other toxic metabolites, such as ammonia, which reached values as high as in sp-4b .

cell viability was calculated in term of cell lysis, translated by the specific release rates of the intracellular enzyme ldh . for sp4-me, the qldh achieved were lower  than those obtained for sp-4b and sp-4fb  throughout  <dig> days of cultivation, indicating that a lower percentage of cell lysis occurred in the sp-4me culture. despite no complete depletion of either glucose or glutamine was observed in the strategies tested, cells in sp4-me were not continuously subjected to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, which probably had a positive effect on cell viability .

expansion and characterization of undifferentiated nt <dig> cells in a bioreactor
from the results shown above, sp-4me was the most promising culture strategy for expansion of undifferentiated stem cell. the next step was the implementation of this strategy in a fully controlled  <dig> ml bioreactor, br-4me.

the growth curve obtained for the bioreactor run br-4me was comparable to the one obtained for the medium exchange operation mode in spinner sp-4me; similar apparent growth rates and maximum concentrations were obtained . nt <dig> cells expanded in the bioreactor for  <dig> days were characterized in terms of pluripotency, undifferentiated phenotype and differentiation potential. the expression of stem cell markers  and nestin, an intermediate filament protein associated with undifferentiated phenotype of nt <dig> cells  <cit> , was detected during exponential growth phase  and at day  <dig> . this labeling pattern was similar to the cell inoculum .

moreover, in addition to the expression of stem markers analysis, the expanded cells ability to differentiate into neurons was also confirmed. for that purpose, cells were collected at  <dig> time points  and induced to differentiate into neurons using the standard static differentiation protocol  <cit> . after treatment with ra and further cultivation in mi medium, the neuronal differentiation efficiency  was similar for all culture samples, presenting values in the range typically obtained for the static differentiation protocol   <cit> . the differentiated neurons were identified by βiii-tub and map <dig> positive staining .

overall, these results showed that nt <dig> cells maintained their pluripotency, undifferentiated phenotype, and differentiation potential along expansion in the bioreactor.

integrating expansion and neuronal differentiation of nt <dig> cells in the bioreactor
once the expansion of pluripotent nt <dig> cells was adapted and characterized in the bioreactor system, we further integrated the neuronal differentiation step according to serra et al  <cit> . neuronal differentiation was induced by ra addition when cells achieved the middle of the exponential growth phase at day  <dig> . flow cytometry analysis of cell populations showed that the levels of oct- <dig>  and tra-1- <dig>  obtained for the inoculum were kept at day  <dig> of the bioreactor culture , confirming that the stem cell population was maintained at this time point.

throughout differentiation, the aggregate size increased, reaching average diameters of  <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> μm after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks of ra treatment, respectively . the aggregate shape became uniform, forming compact and spherical structures . immunofluorescence microscopy of aggregate cryosections showed that these were neurospheres, composed of precursors  and differentiated neurons , the latest distributed preferentially at the surface .

neurosphere size and neuronal differentiation efficiency are expressed as mean ± sem from n =  <dig> independent bioreactor experiments.

after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days of bioreactor culture , neurospheres were harvested and cultured for  <dig> days, on pdl-mg coated flasks, in mi medium, to allow cell migration and inhibit cell proliferation. one day post-seeding, the presence of neurites surrounding the neurospheres was more pronounced on cultures harvested at day  <dig> , while on neurospheres harvested earlier, cells with flattened morphology predominated . three days post-seeding, the cell culture composition was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy . cultures derived from neurospheres harvested at day  <dig> were richer in neurons  and presented more developed neuritic networks than the neurospheres harvested at day  <dig> . a reduced number of βiii-tub-positive cells was detected in cultures derived from neurospheres collected at day  <dig>  in which nestin-positive cells predominated . the estimated neuronal differentiation efficiency was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for cultures derived from neurospheres harvested at day  <dig> and  <dig> . the results obtained until day  <dig> were similar to the ones described for the spinner culture  <cit> , both in culture profile and differentiation efficiency, proving that the integrated culture strategy was successfully implemented in the bioreactor. moreover, by extending the ra treatments for an additional week, a significant increase in the yield of neuronal differentiated cells was obtained .

discussion
to fully fulfill the expectations raised by cell therapy it is urgent to develop robust and totally controlled culture systems, specially designed for the production of high numbers of differentiated and well characterized cells, expanded as fast and pure as possible. in the present study, we successfully developed a bioprocess for the rapid production of human neurons using fully controlled stirred tank bioreactors . this was accomplished by integrating human nt <dig> cell expansion and differentiation in a two-step bioprocess.

in this particular study, an ideal expansion strategy should assure the fast production of high numbers of stem cells without compromising their potential. we demonstrated that, along expansion as 3-d aggregates, nt <dig> cells maintained their pluripotent and undifferentiated phenotype as well as the ability to differentiate into neurons. different bioreaction parameters, including cell inoculum concentration and culture operation mode were studied. the results indicate  <dig> ×  <dig> cell/ml as the most adequate inoculum strategy to be integrated with the differentiation step, as it allowed higher cell densities in less culture time contributing to a fast overall process. however, the feasibility of starting the cultures with inoculum concentrations as lower as  <dig> ×  <dig> cell/ml looks promising for specific clinical applications in which the starting material is a limiting factor. although lower inoculation concentrations have been used to expand undifferentiated murine embryonic stem cells as aggregates  <cit> , nt <dig> cell proliferation could not be achieved when 4×  <dig> cell/ml were used. this difference in cell behavior may reflect the distinct cell origins, as nt <dig> are pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma stem cells, derived from teratocarcinomas  <cit> , that closely resemble the human embryonic stem cells derived from the blastocyst inner cell mass  <cit> .

by using a fed-batch strategy, where low levels of glucose were maintained in culture, it was possible to enhanced glucose metabolism efficiency with a concomitant improvement of the fi in cell concentration and increase of culture lifespan. this strategy may have minimized the toxicity effect associated with lactate accumulation, as reported previously for several animal cell cultures  <cit> . nevertheless, the accumulation of other toxic metabolites, including ammonia, resulted in an increase in cell death. the possible depletion of nutrients  as well as the exhaustion of essential small molecules, namely growth factors, not replenished in the glucose fed-batch strategy, may have contributed to arrest cell growth. the media exchange mode overcame these drawbacks, being the most efficient strategy to enhance undifferentiated stem cell cultivation, as shown by the higher cell densities and higher culture viability obtained throughout the cultivation time. therefore this strategy was chosen for implementation in the controlled bioreactor in which stem cell expansion was successfully reproduced, confirming the robustness of the process. media exchange and perfusion strategies have been used previously for adult stem cell cultivation  <cit>  and human embryoid bodies  <cit> . in order to achieve higher expansion ratios, as those obtained for the expansion process as aggregates of murine embryonic stem cell  <cit>  and human neuronal precursor cell  <cit> , serial passage with addition of fresh media can be further included.

by incorporating both expansion and differentiation steps in an integrated bioprocess, this strategy also assures the feasibility of expanding human differentiated neurons derived from a continuous source of pluripotent stem cells. the system described herein allows for obtaining well differentiated neurons after  <dig> weeks of differentiation, as well as higher yields of neurons for a later culture time. importantly, when compared to well established static differentiation protocols, this methodology drastically enhanced the neuronal differentiation efficiency of nt <dig> cells and reduced the time needed for differentiation process; for a differentiation time of  <dig> days in the bioreactor culture a 10-fold improvement in yield was observed over the static culture protocols lasting  <dig> days  <cit> .

in this work, the expansion and differentiation of nt <dig> cells was successful validated in computer-controlled bioreactors. in future, further optimizations can be attempted aiming to determine the optimal conditions  to grow and differentiate nt <dig> cells. so far, some studies have demonstrated that low po <dig> decreases the rate of stem cell differentiation and enhances stem cell proliferation  <cit> . nieruebuegge et al. also reported a significant increase in final cell number as well as an improvement of cardiac-enriched genes in hebs cultures under hypoxic conditions   <cit> . a recent study reports that rat mesenchymal stem cell differentiation is enhanced at lower temperatures  than in 37°c conditions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, a scalable and efficient two-step bioprocess for the generation of human nt2-derived neurons was developed in a fully controlled bioreactor, allowing continuous monitoring, non-invasive sampling and characterization. by integrating a fast expansion step with an efficient differentiation process, this strategy significantly reduced the time and improved the yields of the neuronal differentiation, when compared to the standard static differentiation protocols.

the controlled bioprocess developed herein can be adaptable to other cell types, including hescs and ips, representing a strong and promising starting point for the development of novel technologies for the production of differentiated derivatives from pluripotent cells.
