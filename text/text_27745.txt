BACKGROUND
various interactions among proteins are essential to diverse biological functions in a living cell. information about these interactions provides a basis to construct protein interaction networks and improves our understanding of the general principles of the workings of biological systems  <cit> . the study of protein-protein interaction  is, therefore, an important theme of systems biology  <cit> . recent years have seen the development of experimental approaches to analyze ppis, including yeast two-hybrid   <cit> , coimmunoprecipitation   <cit>  and other approaches  <cit> . the resulting interaction data is publicly available in several databases such as bind  <cit> , dip  <cit> , mips  <cit>  and intact  <cit> .

while experimentally detected interactions present only a small fraction of the real ppi network  <cit> , many computational methods have been developed to provide complementary information for experimental approaches. some of these computational methods require not only sequence information but also auxiliary data, for example, localization data  <cit> , structural data  <cit> , expression data  <cit>  and/or interactions from orthologs  <cit> . shoemaker and panchenko have provided a comprehensive review of these computational methods  <cit> .

the main limitation of above methods is that they rely on prior knowledge that may be expensive to acquire. to overcome this limitation, several de novo  algorithms have been proposed to detect potential interacting proteins for which no auxiliary information are available  <cit> . most of these de novo ppi predictors transform protein sequences into feature vectors and adopt supervised machine learning  techniques to analyze these feature vectors. najafabadi and salavati proposed a method based on codon usage  <cit> , which utilizes dna sequence for feature extraction and requires open reading frame  information. the adopted ml techniques include random decision forests  <cit>  and support vector machines   <cit> . these ml-based approaches achieved satisfactory performance on the input datasets comprising equal number of interacting and non-interacting protein pairs. however, this ratio is not balanced in nature, and these methods were not comprehensively evaluated with respect to the effect of the large number of non-interacting pairs in a naturally unbalanced dataset  <cit> . this unbalanced characteristic of ppi datasets, as will be elaborated in this study, requires more attention when developing and evaluating ppi prediction methods.

this study presents a novel ml-based method using only the primary sequences to predict interacting proteins. the proposed feature set is improved from the conjoint triad feature  <cit> , which describes a protein sequence by the frequencies of distinct conjoint triads--three continuous amino acids--observed in it. we propose a probability-based mechanism for estimating the significance of triad occurrences considering the amino acid composition. this improvement is designed to mitigate the dependency of triad occurrence frequencies on the amino acid distribution. another notable contribution of this study is to provide a systematic analysis of the effect of dataset sampling when evaluating prediction performance.

this article reports several experiments conducted to evaluate the present de novo ppi predictor. a large collection of  <dig>  interacting pairs from  <dig>  proteins are adopted to generate different unbalanced datasets with 1:1~1: <dig> positive-to-negative ratios. as illustrated by the experimental results, the proposed feature set achieves the best prediction performance when compared with two de novo feature sets recently published for ppi prediction. furthermore, the analyses included in this study reveal that a) the extent of imbalance of the sampled dataset and b) the efficiency of the employed classification algorithm are important to ppi predictors.

RESULTS
in this section, a quick overview of the proposed method is first presented, where the details are left in the methods section. the issues of handling unbalanced data are then addressed to reveal the importance of data imbalance in experiments, followed by experimental results. the end of this section discusses some considerations for real world ppi data.

proposed ppi predictor
the present method uses only sequence information for training a classifier to distinguish positive instances of truly interacting protein pairs from negative instances of non-interacting protein pairs. shen et al.  <cit>  have shown that the triad frequency is a useful feature encoding for ppi prediction. however, the frequencies of different triads are largely affected by the amino acids distribution. thus, a probability-based mechanism of estimating triad significance is proposed to alleviate the effect of the amino acid distribution in nature. the relaxed variable kernel density estimator , recently proposed by the authors  <cit> , is then invoked to predict protein-protein interactions based on the feature vectors. the details of how to transform protein pairs into feature vectors, the algorithm of rvkde classifier and some implementation issues can be found in the methods section.

noteworthy issues for predicting unbalanced datasets
in ppi prediction, positive instances are collected from ppi databases, while negative instances are all other protein pairs. this is a large and extremely unbalanced data. a common practice in processing such unbalanced datasets is to form a balanced dataset by sampling from the original dataset. this step of sampling, however, raises new problems. for example, figure  <dig> shows a synthesized 1: <dig> dataset . figure  <dig>  which is a sampled 1: <dig> dataset, contains all the positive instances and arbitrarily selected negative instances from figure  <dig>  predictora and predictorb--represented by their decision boundaries--are two predictors. both predictors perform better on the sampled dataset than the original dataset. after sampling, some of negative instances that are close to the positive cluster are excluded. that leads to an easier dataset for classification. another observation from figure  <dig> relates to the performance differences between the two predictors. predictorb is obviously better than predictora in figure  <dig>  however, in a sampled data such as figure  <dig>  predictorb looks to have comparable performance with predictora. as a result, sampling to create balanced datasets not only simplifies the problem, but also prevents a realistic comparison of different predictors.

this study uses unbalanced datasets of different positive-to-negative ratios for performance evaluation to elucidate how the sampled datasets affect the prediction performance. however, handling unbalanced datasets leads to two problems. the first problem is choosing a suitable evaluation measure. table  <dig> shows five widely used measurements for binary classification problems. a predictor which simply predicts all samples as negative will have an accuracy of  <dig> % in a 1: <dig> dataset. despite the appealing score, this strategy is useless because it cannot predict any potential interactions. maximizing accuracy leads predictors to favor the majority group. in ppi prediction, however, we care more about the interacting pairs, which are the minority group. f-measure is a more appropriate measurement because it is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity, both of which are related to the performance of the positive instances  <cit> .

1the definition of the abbreviations used: tp is the number of interacting protein pairs correctly classified; fn is the number of interacting protein pairs incorrectly classified as non-interacting; tn is the number of non-interacting protein pairs correctly classified; and fp is the number of non-interacting protein pairs incorrectly classified as interacting.

another problem of processing unbalanced datasets is the increasing size. for example, using the widely used libsvm package  <cit>  to analyze a 1: <dig> dataset containing  <dig>  protein pairs requires  <dig>  seconds. the execution time is measured on a workstation equipped with an intel core  <dig> duo e <dig>  <dig>  ghz cpu and  <dig> gb memory, and do not include the time taken to carry out parameter selection or cross validation. according to the observed time complexity of svm  <cit> , a complete parameter selection on a 1: <dig> dataset of the same amount of positive samples may take months or even years using a contemporary workstation. conversely, analyzing the same 1: <dig> dataset with rvkde takes only  <dig> seconds on the same workstation mentioned above, allowing for the analysis of unbalanced datasets within a reasonable time. on the other hand, replacing svm with rvkde sacrifices a slight prediction performance of  <dig> % f-measure  on a 1: <dig> dataset used in this study. thus, this study employs rvkde as the classification algorithm to compare alternative feature sets. its efficiency is essential for handling highly unbalanced datasets.

evaluation of the proposed feature set
datasets
this study adopts a collection of protein-protein interactions from the human protein reference database   <cit> , release  <dig>  this version of hprd contains  <dig>  ppi and  <dig>  protein entries from literature. interactions in which more than two proteins participate are removed, since it is difficult to confirm which individual proteins in such complexes have physical interactions  <cit> . furthermore, interactions that contain a protein sequence with selenocysteine  are also removed. the remaining set comprises  <dig>  interacting protein pairs in which  <dig>  proteins are involved. since interactions detected based on in vitro experiments might be false positives that occur in laboratory procedures but do not occur physiologically  <cit> , only the in vivo ppi pairs are used in preparing the positive set to prevent introducing spurious interactions. the resultant positive set comprises  <dig>  interacting protein pairs and  <dig>  proteins. this study follows the procedure in a previous work  <cit>  to construct a negative set, which ensures that  a negative sample is not in any of the  <dig>  interactions  and  the two individual proteins of a negative instance are included in the  <dig>  proteins of the positive set. thus, a dataset of m interacting pairs that contain n proteins can generate n/ <dig> - m negative instances.

this work arbitrarily divides the  <dig>  positive instances into two subsets for the training and testing sets, respectively. the training set includes  <dig>  positive instances and the testing set includes the remaining  <dig>  positive instances. datasets with different positive-to-negative ratios are generated with the same positive instances and distinct negative sets, which are obtained by randomly sampling from the negative instances. care has been taken to ensure that a negative instance would not be selected in more than one set. since the procedure to generate training and testing datasets involves randomness, the prediction process is repeated  <dig> times to alleviate the evaluation bias in a single prediction process. all the training and testing datasets with different positive-to-negative ratios are available at http://mbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/ppi/ppi.tgz, for any following studies of ppi prediction that require unbalanced datasets as a benchmark to compare with.

comparison with similar works
this study adopts a large collection of protein-protein interactions to illustrate the importance of dataset imbalance. hence, the present significance vector is compared with two advanced feature sets recently published for de novo ppi prediction that have been shown delivering good performance on large datasets   <cit> . the first feature set was developed by shen et al., which employed the frequency of conjoint triads as the feature set  <cit> . this feature set has been reported to achieve > <dig> % precision, > <dig> % sensitivity and > <dig> % accuracy, and is the first study of conducting large-scale experiments on the whole hprd data to show its robustness and reliability. the second feature set was developed by guo et al., which proposed a feature representation using auto cross covariance  <cit> . this feature set has a reported accuracy of  <dig> % on the ppi data of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, and also achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % on another independent data set of yeast ppis.

the best performance among each positive-to-negative ratio is highlighted with bold font. 1the parameter selection is based on a five-fold cross validation of the training dataset to maximize the f-measure. 2using triad frequency as the feature set. 3using auto cross covariance as the feature set. 4using triad significance as the feature set.

in figure  <dig>  the present feature set has an advantage of ~3% accuracy on the 1: <dig> dataset, but this advantage decreases as the positive-to-negative ratio is getting more unbalanced. the advantage is only  <dig> % and  <dig> % on the 1: <dig> dataset. conversely, this feature set has an advantage of <3% f-measure on the 1: <dig> dataset. this advantage increases with the positive-to-negative ratio, leading to an advantage of  <dig> % and  <dig> % on the 1: <dig> dataset. the different trends between the two measurements are reasonable and could be explained by the performance of the opportunistic predictor. for accuracy, the opportunistic predicts all query protein pairs as negative, thus a high accuracy can be achieved in an extremely unbalanced dataset without detecting any interacting pairs. on the other hand, both trivial predictors deliver decreasing performances as the dataset gets more unbalanced in terms of f-measure. these results imply that the problem is getting harder as the dataset is getting more unbalanced, which concurs with the observations elaborated in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the precision vs. sensitivity curve for the 1: <dig> dataset, where the proposed significance vector generally performs better than the two compared works when precision is greater than 30%.

considerations for real word data
we have presented a predictor that is consistently better than the compared methods on datasets of varying data imbalance, but a critical question is how the predictor would perform on real world data. this is an open question for not only ppi prediction but many other bioinformatics fields, and there are currently no satisfactory solutions.

to illustrate this issue, we create a dataset of all the protein pairs from the  <dig>  proteins present in the hprd in vivo ppi dataset. this dataset contains  <dig>  in vivo ppis and  <dig> , <dig> negative samples that are not in any of the  <dig>  hprd interactions, and has an extreme positive-to-negative ratio of ~1: <dig>  which we will call the comprehensive dataset. training with such a comprehensive dataset would take more than  <dig> days using rvkde and decades using svm. hence, we use a lower ratio  for training then test the model on a dataset with the desired positive-to-negative ratio. such a comprehensive dataset, however, would likely contain many false negative samples  given the incompleteness of the human protein-protein interaction data, biasing the results. some previous studies proposed to restrict negative samples that are located in different cellular compartments to avoid such false negative samples  <cit> . a second dataset is thus created by removing the negative samples of which the two proteins are in the same cellular compartment from the comprehensive dataset. this dataset, which we call the compartmental dataset, contains  <dig>  negative samples and has a positive-to-negative ratio of ~1: <dig> 

the f-measure of the present method on the comprehensive dataset is  <dig> %. this performance is overly pessimistic due to the incompleteness of human protein interactions network . based on current understanding, the size of pin comprises ~ <dig>  interactions  <cit> . however, less than 3% interactions are currently identified and collected in hprd. namely, even a perfect predictor cannot deliver an f-measure greater than 6%. on the other hand, the f-measure on the compartmental dataset achieves  <dig> %. note that this f-measure is higher than those obtained by evaluating on the 1: <dig> and 1: <dig> datasets in table  <dig>  the process of removing false negatives also removes the true negatives localized in the same cellular compartment that are difficult to discriminate from interacting pairs, making the problem easier. it might reduce the learning problem to that of classifying whether two proteins are in the same cellular compartment.

in summary, the realistic performance drops in between  <dig> % and  <dig> %. this wide range reveals a) the impact on the performance from different strategies of negative dataset construction and b) the difficulty in estimating the performance for real world data. currently, de novo approaches are suitable to analyze a certain type of interactions  that features a lower degree of imbalance, while more effort is needed to alleviate the decreasing performance from the degree of imbalance for general protein interactions. more work on evaluation schemes is also required to provide a reasonable and realistic test to assess ppi predictors.

CONCLUSIONS
this article presents a novel method for predicting protein-protein interactions only using the primary sequences of proteins, which consistently outperforms other algorithms in the same category for a collection of datasets. we have used rvkde, an efficient machine learning algorithm, to achieve an extensive evaluation on alternative approaches with highly unbalanced data. the results reveal the importance of dataset construction and the issue of data sampling in problems with naturally unbalanced distributions. finally, a discussion on real world data is included, which show that much improvement in de novo ppi predictors are needed before they can be effectively used on general protein interactions.
