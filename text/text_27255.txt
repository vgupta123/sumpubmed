BACKGROUND
after emerging as one of the main sources of subject-specific variation in the human genome, single nucleotide polymorphisms  are now routinely used to investigate the role of genetics in a wide spectrum of diseases  <cit> . the number of known snps is continuously growing and it is presently approaching twelve million . technological progress is now enabling the genotyping of up to one million snps at a time, a number also expected to increase rapidly. this provides scientists with a considerable amount of information for the study of gene-disease associations  <cit> . the ability to identify associations by statistical analyses of snp data is challenged by such high dimensionality. strategies to organize snp information for discovery of disease susceptibility loci have been proposed  <cit> . some of these methods are especially useful when dealing with binary covariates  <cit> , while others require exceptional computer power  <cit> .

by studying the distribution of linkage disequilibrium  across the genome, several authors observed that ld is related to the distance between markers  <cit> . the relationship between intermarker distance and ld does not follow a regular pattern and is related to the particular location in the human genome  <cit> . from these observations, it has been suggested that genetic information could be clustered into smaller sets of genomic regions  <cit>  possibly separated by recombination hot spots  <cit> . although the exact genetic basis for the existence of these regions is still controversial, empirically, the statistical dependence of neighboring snps was shown to be high. the evidence that snps cluster more than by chance alone suggests that treating snps as independent entities in association studies could be inefficient, and prone to missing true loci if multiple testing adjustments are applied. recently, haplotype block partitioning was successfully used to accommodate the multiple testing concern while detecting genetic association in prostate cancer  <cit> . however, block partitioning methods differ substantially in their results  <cit> . most comparisons between blocking methods have focused on their similarity in boundary calling or snp membership, rather than on their ability to detect true associations.

in the present article we develop and validate a new methodology for dna block partitioning, with a focus on improving power for association studies. partitioning is viewed pragmatically as a genetically motivated approach to address the challenge of dimensionality. our goal is to improve power in multiple testing and to make association testing units that are biologically meaningful. we consider each block as a single entity, by estimating a within block haplotype, thus reducing a sequence of s consecutive snps into k consecutive haplotype blocks. for inference on blocks we propose a probabilistic approach based on the ld map: the key idea is that pairwise ld statistics can arise from one of two separate probability distribution functions, one being the ld distribution, the other the independence distribution. this is, of course, a simplification because real ld is not binary, but this assumption has been the essence of the haplotype blocking concept. from this standpoint, blocking is similar to a classification problem and can be handled using an optimal bayes classifier. the result is a vector of probability scores for each candidate block border snp.

to implement this plan, we developed an mcmc algorithm to identify blocks of linkage disequilibrium  and a framework for using matilde partitions in genetic association analysis. our implementation presents several advantages over existing approaches, including: a) the estimation of the distribution of chance ld is specific to the population, the technology and the sample size of the study considered; b) the uncertainty about block boundaries and about whether any two snps are in the same block is assessed probabilistically, and c) the option for users to tune the probability threshold for assigning snps to the same block.

from the perspective of association studies, a block partitioning algorithm is more appealing than other ones if it provides the researcher higher chance to detect a snp truly associated to the study trait. with detection of association in mind, we compared matilde and the most commonly used methods for haplotype block partitioning with respect to their ability to capture truly associated snps, rather than on boundary or membership agreement as in previous comparisons  <cit> .

RESULTS
in our analysis we considered a representative data set from the hapmap project  <cit>  . we considered the first  <dig> non redundant snps in region 14q <dig>  with minor allele frequency  greater than  <dig>  and hardy weinberg equilibrium  at α =  <dig> . for simplicity, we focused on unrelated individuals from a homogeneous population, by choosing the  <dig> japanese, who represent the largest group of unrelated individuals within hapmap. on this data set we first carried out descriptive comparisons of block partitioning approaches, and then we performed controlled simulated experiments to assess the ability of our method to identify disease loci.

block partitioning of hapmap data
to illustrate how matilde captures ld-block information, we compared it to commonly used methods for block partitioning. among the many methods available, we chose the limited haplotype diversity method by patil et al.  <cit>  and extended by zhang et al.  <cit> , as implemented in the hapblock software  <cit>  , and the three ld-based methods implemented in the haploview software  <cit> : the gabriel et al. approach  <cit>  , the solid spine of ld , and the four gamete test  <cit>  . the computational speed of matilde was comparable to that of the hapblock algorithm, with both being significantly slower than the rest. as expected, we observed pronounced differences in the ld map, depending on the ld statistic . when ld was estimated with |d'|, many contiguous snps were clustering in blocks, but strong ld was also observed between very distant snps, in a pattern characterized by noisy stripes. this trend is clearer when zooming in on the region from the 400th to the 500th snp . this made identification of block partitions more difficult. a cleaner picture was given by r <dig> , which identified a few big blocks, interspersed by a number of smaller ones, and areas with no blocks.

after  <dig>  iterations of matilde, the posterior distribution of ld blocks resulted in the partition represented by the triangles on the lower right of the four panels of fig.  <dig>  the representation is based on a threshold of  <dig>  on the marginal probability that each location is a block boundary: matilde isolated plausible ld blocks when based on r <dig>  while the noise in |d'| results in a less appealing partition. the number of estimated blocks was  <dig> with r <dig> and  <dig> with |d'|, including singletons. on the same data, hapblock estimated  <dig> bigger blocks, dprimeci  <dig> . intermediate values were observed when 4gamete and ssd were used.

when increasing the sample size from  <dig> to  <dig>  using a resampling approach, the number of blocks estimated by dprimeci decreases slightly from  <dig> to  <dig> . 4gamete and ssd were stable , while hapblock  was intermediate. matilde with r <dig> and a  <dig>  probability cutoff for block boundaries had a cv of  <dig> %. the relatively high variation of dprimeci and matilde reflects their ability to take advantage of a more favorable signal-to-noise ratio to provide a more refined block partition.

a different trend was observed when matilde was applied to |d'|. with increasing sample size the number of blocks quickly degenerates to  <dig>  this effect can be explained by a pronounced clustering of |d'| values to the maximum, which amplifies noise patterns at distant loci. this "ceiling effect" was also reported in a study comparing population recombination rates  <cit> . the ceiling effect is sensitive to noise, especially when the sample size is small or the allele frequency is extreme, in which case many observed high disequilibrium pairs would only be due to missing allelic combinations at one locus. using r <dig> results in a much reduced sensitivity to this problem  <cit> . for this reason, we only used r <dig> in the simulation studies.

an overview of the partitions obtained with each method is given in fig.  <dig>  for a sample size of  <dig>  by modulating the probability cutoff, matilde can generate a fine partition, as do ld-based methods, or a coarse one, as hapblock . matilde proved stable over varying cutoff, with little variation in the break points occurring for cutoffs between  <dig>  and  <dig> . in most instances, matilde estimated fewer single-snp blocks than dprimeci and 4gamete, but a greater number of smaller blocks than hapblock. moderate to good agreement of break points was observed between dprimeci, ssd, and 4gamete: κ between dprimeci and 4gamete ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , depending on sample size; κ's between ssd and dprimeci were  <dig> – <dig> ; while they were  <dig> – <dig>  between ssd and 4gamete. dprimeci, ssd, and 4gamete were not in agreement with hapblock . generally, matilde was in an intermediate position between the ld-based approaches and hapblock. κ between matilde and hapblock was low but not null, often taking values greater than  <dig> . when comparing matilde to the three ld-based approaches, we observed that κ was nearly the same, usually ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the highest agreement was observed between matilde and ssd. in general, as the probability cutoff increased, the agreement between matilde and dprimeci, 4gamete, and ssd decreased. when hapblock was considered, the agreement with matilde was higher for central probability cutoffs . when a break point was concomitantly recognized by the common methods, it was typically detected by matilde as well.

comparison of performance in association studies
in our simulation studies, described in detail in the methods section, we generated artificial case-control studies with a single disease snp, using two genotype-phenotype association models  and a range of odds ratios and sample sizes. we applied this approach in turn to all snps in the chosen region. this strategy preserves the observed ld in the hapmap sample. after estimating within block haplotypes, we used the likelihood ratio statistics  applied to the marginal distribution of haplotypes for each block, i.e., we performed a haplotype-based comparison rather than a diplotype-based comparison, such that each individual contributes two haplotypes, rather than one diplotype to the statistic. snps not in a block were considered a block of size one and in this situation, the lrs was an allelic snp test. the sensitivity and specificity for detecting the causal snp are reported in fig.  <dig>  for each method, block, and simulated dataset, we declare a positive if the p-value, after multiple testing adjustment with the benjamini-hochberg method  <cit> , is smaller than . <dig>  matilde can be used at different cutoffs for the probability that a snp is a boundary point between blocks. varying this threshold generates the receiver operating characteristic  curve shown. the other methods produce a single sensitivity/ pair. dprimeci, 4gamete and ssd had high specificity for all or's, but very low sensitivity. at the other extreme, sensitivity was generally high for hapblock, but this method had a poor specificity thus giving a high number of false positives. matilde was performing generally at equal or better sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs than the existing methods, and had the additional advantage that it could be tuned to have a higher sensitivity than the ld-based approaches. when compared to hapblock, for p-value thresholds that achieve the same sensitivity level, matilde had about 10% greater specificity, and for the same specificity, nearly half the probability of missing a true effect – a practically important difference especially in screening studies. a better performance of matilde over other methods was observed for all sample sizes considered, as shown in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

in addition to blocking approaches, we performed two types of single-snp association analysis: allele-based, indicated with an 'x' in the graph, and genotype-based, indicated with an '+' in the graph. these are described in more detail in the methods section. while the genotype-based analysis is more appropriate and more common in practice, the allele-based single-snp analysis is reported because it is more directly comparable with the blocking methods, as it does not use phase information. any gains seen in comparing the "x" with the blocking algorithms can be attributed to blocking. the sensitivity of the allele-based single-snp analysis is zero in all scenarios, though some positive calls would be made at a higher false discovery rate  of  <dig> . in practice, even in snp-by-snp studies, snps in close proximity with the one with the lowest p-value may be examined closely, as snps close to the causal snp may have low p-values as a result of linkage disequilibrium. to capture this practice, we relaxed our definition of a "correct call" in our sensitivity/specificity calculations by considering as true positives all loci who were within a given distance from the causal snp, and satisfied the fdr threshold. we examined snp windows of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> snps on each side. in all cases, results were similar to those reported in fig.  <dig>  and the gain in sensitivity was very modest.

fig.  <dig> summarizes results obtained using two additional comparison criteria that better highlight important properties of the blocking approaches. criterion r represents the ratio of the rank of the block including the causal snp, and the total number of blocks. on the left sides of the four panels, we reported the distribution of r at ors ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the better methods are those with distributions of r closer to  <dig>  boxplots represent variability over simulated datasets. for small effects, that is or =  <dig> , the median r's for dprimeci, ssd and 4gamete were comparable, and all are higher than for hapblock. the median for matilde at several cutoffs was the highest, by a sizeable margin, even when compared to the single snp analysis. this is because, for small effects, there are often several snps that are ranked better than the causal one in the single locus analysis. at increasing or's the performance of dprimeci and 4gamete improved and for values bigger than  <dig> , they were on average slightly better than matilde. for effects ≥  <dig> , the analysis at single locus outperformed the other methods .

criterion b is the count of snps belonging to blocks ranked as high or higher than the block including the correct snp . lower values of b are preferable. for small or's, the blocking methods performed comparably, with the exception of matilde at cutoffs ≤  <dig> , which had a better performance. at higher or's  the methods with the highest number of single-snp blocks  had a significantly better performance than ssd, hapblock and matilde with bigger cutoffs. as expected, the single snp analysis performed better than blocking methods by this criterion. consistently, low-cutoff matilde provided the best performance in both r and b.

discussion
overall, our experimental results suggest that probabilistic modeling of ld patterns is a useful approach to summarize a high dimensional collection of snps into a smaller set of haplotype blocks when searching for disease-related loci. our methodology, implemented in the matilde program, adapts to the available data, provides an assessment of uncertainty, and can be used flexibly as a dimension reduction tool compared to the alternatives available so far. in our hapmap-based simulation experiments, matilde showed the best ability to rank loci when looking for small effect sizes. this is a critical strength, since most snp association studies involve small effect sizes. an important, empirical example, in this sense, was recently illustrated in the field of prostate cancer  <cit> . dprimeci and 4gamete perform well in ranking, though at the cost of a large number of single-snp blocks, which makes these methods less efficient when using multiple comparisons corrections. matilde also provides significant gains in sensitivity when a low specificity is appropriate – as in snp screening studies – and is comparable to the other methods considered in the high specificity range.

for a broad range of sample sizes and effect sizes, traditional single-snp analyses fail to find the causal locus. these analyses only become effective when the sample size is greater than  <dig> and the effect size is at least  <dig>  – a rare case in genomics. otherwise, grouping snps into blocks with any method is a better solution. this conclusion reinforces the suggestion of zhang et al.  <cit>  that haplotype-based analysis can be much more powerful than single locus analysis. their study was based on hapblock. in our simulations matilde shows better performance than hapblock, so the case for blocking is now stronger.

while our simulations consider a large number of scenarios  and are closely mimicking real data, there remain some limitations. first, because of the computational burden, it would have been prohibitive to consider the joint distribution at two chromosomes after blocking. thus our comparisons are based on the simpler unphased haplotype estimation, whereby each subject contributes two separate haplotypes, and association is assessed by comparing the distribution of cases' haplotypes to that of the controls. this approach is still the most prevalent in applications, but may negatively affect the performance of all blocking methods, and may favor the single marker analysis for big effects, especially with regard to the r and b performance criteria. to explore the potential gains in efficiency that can be expected when using the phase information, we carried out a genotype-based single-snp analysis. this is indicated by a '+' in fig.  <dig> and should be compared only to the 'x' symbol, which represents the results of the allele-based single-snp analysis. we also reported both analyses in fig.  <dig>  for r and b the results are similar, while a difference is observed at an or of  <dig>  in fig.  <dig>  the latter, however is partly the result of a sensitivity to the choice of the significance level, and is not as pronounced when a stricter level of . <dig> is required.

as a second limitation, we focused our comparison on the most commonly used block partitioning methods. minimum description length  methods  <cit> , including the mdblock implementation  <cit> , have also been shown to reliably locate boundaries between blocks at regions of rapid ld decay, and produce block partitions of intermediate size between those of ld-based approaches and those given by limited haplotype diversity methods. additionally, future work could consider the comparison between blocking and using tagging snps. two useful approaches, haploblockfinder  <cit>  and htsnper  <cit> , produce both haplotype or ld blocks, and tagging snps. as they yield block partitions similar to those of methods already covered by haploview and hapblock, they were not considered here, but would be natural choices if tagging snps were studied. lastly, the ihap   <cit>  integrates several block partitioning and tagging snps methods with web resources for gene finding. it was explicitly defined to mine the hapmap dataset by means of the hapblock software and it has not the aim to process user's genotype data.

our results include a descriptive analysis of the agreement among blocking approaches. our goal is to provide further intuition about the reasons behind the performance of different blocking methods in identifying disease snps, rather than fully characterizing their behavior from a population genetics viewpoint. in our study, block partitioning is an intermediate step towards identifying genotype-phenotype associations, which is ultimately assessed through statistical models. this bypasses the need for a gold standard for haplotype blocks, and also brings the evaluation closer to practical study goals. to account for the potential instability of estimated blocks when small sample sizes are taken  <cit> , we also examined large sample sizes.

while several measurements of agreement between blocks are available in the literature, we chose the simple κ statistic on the between block break points. alternatively, the sb <dig> statistic  <cit>  would have been useful when comparing two populations one of which is considered less diverse than the other one, that is, in the case where block boundaries could vary among populations. in our case, however, we were considering a homogeneous sample of subjects from the same geographical location and testing different methods over the same small chromosomal segment. our results were consistent with those of schwartz et al.  <cit>  who defined an agreement statistic based on the number of shared boundaries. the block partition given by matilde was more similar to the ld-based methods than to hapblock. since the matilde block estimation is based on the ld map, this finding was not surprising. other authors  <cit>  compared the ld-based method of gabriel et al.  <cit>  and the limited haplotype diversity method of patil et al.  <cit> , in the zhang et al. formulation  <cit> : they found that block partitions given by the two methods were different, strongly dependent on minor allele frequencies, and sensitive to changes in the algorithms' parameters. we confirm the previous observation  <cit>  that the method from gabriel et al.  <cit>  generates a higher number of smaller blocks than that of patil et al.  <cit> .

block partitioning criteria can potentially perform at different levels of sensitivity and specificity in different populations. spatial correlation in the genome can be influenced by a variety of factors, including demographic history and recombination hotspots  <cit> . depending on how these factors contribute to the block structure in a population, different partitioning criteria may differ in their ability to identify associations. an assessment of how different methods could perform in populations with different demographic evolution is an interesting question for further research. matilde, however, differs from biologically based methods such as the four gamete rule  <cit>  as it was designed pragmatically, without any reference to biological theories about the origin of blocks. we can speculate that matilde may be more powerful than methods based on biological hypotheses in situations where there is noise in the ld pattern, as is the case of outbred populations. in isolated populations, where population growth followed a bottleneck event, haplotype heterogeneity is much smaller and individuals share longer chromosomal regions. when this situation is also accompanied by a reduced number of external individuals, one may expect less noise in the ld pattern, and most of the block partitioning methods should give more similar results.

our method allows users to specify a pairwise measure of ld. this choice matters: in our analysis matilde's performances varied depending on whether r <dig> or |d'| was used. both measures have a clear genetic interpretation. the expected value of r <dig> is a direct function of the population recombination rate, and r <dig> is the standard χ <dig> test statistic divided by the number of chromosomes. thus, it is a natural candidate for testing the disequilibrium between loci  <cit> . strengths and limitations of |d'| have already been described  <cit> . ld can be assessed by many other statistics. an extensive list is provided by devlin and risch  <cit> . an example is levin's population attributable risk  <cit> . statistics that show a robust behavior in case control studies are the difference in proportion d suggested by nei and li  <cit> , the odds ratio, and the yule's q  <cit> ; d and q are bounded between  <dig> and  <dig> and between - <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. more recently, entropy was suggested as a measure of ld for multiallelic loci  <cit> , and the volume measures of ld proved to be robust in case of small samples  <cit> . in addition, potential candidates are the morton's rho  <cit> , which models ld by a linear mixture of snps under non-ld and in perfect ld, and the delta statistic  <cit>  which is less noisy than r <dig> and d', and is robust to allele frequency.

the ability to adapt to snp density is an advantage of using a bayes classifier like matilde. marker density affects the ld distribution  <cit> , though this is not an issue when clustering is used only as a dimension reduction step. in our formulation, block partitioning is related to the specific set of snps typed. this is different from estimating blocks on the basis of recombination hotspots  <cit> , which aims at uncovering an underlying genetic structure.

while our implementation was successful as a proof of principle, additional work remains necessary before the full potential of dimension-reduction by blocking can be realized. for example, computational obstacles remain before the current implementation of matilde can be used efficiently on studies of the size of current genome-wide association analyses. we plan to address these computational issues in future versions of the program.

finally, we hope that the idea of using probabilistic blocking for dimension reduction of dna information can in the future become the foundation for a comprehensive analysis, including haplotype reconstruction, missing data imputation, and modeling of the genotype-phenotype relationship. it has been shown that the best method for haplotype reconstruction when the phase is unknown is also probabilistic and based on mcmc  <cit> . the issue of integrating block partitioning and haplotype reconstruction was already undertaken by some authors  <cit> . additionally, a potentially important extension available within an integrated approach is the ability to construct blocks that optimally capture association signal, a feature which is not presently implemented in our approach.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that at low signal-to-noise ratio, blocking snp's via a classification approach can lead to significant increases in efficiency in identifying disease related loci. for this task, we provided a flexible methodology and software.
