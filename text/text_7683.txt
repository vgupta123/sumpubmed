BACKGROUND
adenoviruses  in the adenoviridae family have been divided into four genera: mastadenovirus, aviadenovirus, atadenovirus, and siadenovirus  <cit> . the adv was first isolated from human adenoids and characterized by two different research teams  <cit> . human adv  fall within the genus mastadenovirus, and cause a wide array of diseases including acute respiratory disease, gastroenteritis, and ocular surface infection  <cit> . the adv is non-enveloped with a double stranded linear genome that ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> kb in size. the icosahedral shaped capsid ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> nanometers in diameter  <cit> . there are  <dig> known hadv serotypes classified into  <dig> species , based on restriction enzyme analysis and hemaglutination assays, later confirmed by genome analyses and phylogenetic calculations. recently, a proposed fifty-second hadv serotype was identified and placed into a new species g  <cit> .

hadv- <dig> was originally isolated in  <dig> from  <dig> eyes and  <dig> genitourinary sites, and subsequently characterized as a new serotype in  <dig>  <cit> . hadv- <dig> is a major etiologic agent of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, an explosive and highly contagious infection of the conjunctiva and cornea, and continues to cause outbreaks  <cit> . hadv- <dig> also was recently implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity  <cit> .

although hadv species d contains the most serotypes, complete sequence is available for only  <dig> – hadv- <dig>  hadv- <dig>  hadv- <dig>  hadv- <dig>  hadv- <dig>  and hadv- <dig> – and none of these have been associated with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. in this study, we have sequenced the complete genome of hadv- <dig> and describe its overall organization. the hadv- <dig> genome appears in most respects typical of other hadv. however, global pairwise genome alignments, phylogenetic analyses, and in silico comparisons of putative viral proteins revealed unique characteristics of the genome, including areas of non-conserved sequence in the penton, hexon, e <dig>  and fiber regions, and differences in size and/or pi of select predicted hadv- <dig> proteins. understanding the disparities between the hadv- <dig> genome and those of species d hadv with dissimilar tissue tropisms may lead to improved understanding of the genomic determinants of infection.

RESULTS
general features
the genome length of hadv- <dig> was found to be  <dig>  base pairs with a base composition of  <dig> % a,  <dig> % t,  <dig> % c,  <dig> % g. the  <dig> % gc content is on the lower end of the 57–59% range previously reported for hadvs within species d  <cit> . cpg dinucleotide analysis of hadv- <dig> performed using fuzznuc software  <cit>  revealed  <dig> cpg dinucleotides located within the genome . we identified the predicted  <dig> early,  <dig> intermediate, and  <dig> late transcription regions similar to those described in other completely sequenced hadvs , including  <dig> predicted coding sequences within the hadv- <dig> genome and  <dig> hypothetical orfs.

the 5' and 3' termini of the hadv genome are composed of inverted terminal repeat  sequences which for hadv- <dig> were determined to be  <dig> bp in length. these sites serve as replication origins for the virus  <cit> . the motif located at the extreme termini of the hadv- <dig> genome consists of a catcatcataat, which is unique among previously sequenced hadv serotypes. unique sequences for the extreme termini have been also observed in other hadvs including hadv- <dig>  <cit> . the conserved ataatatacc motif within the itr, which interacts with the terminal protein precursor  and polymerase complex during dna replication  <cit> , was determined at base pairs 8– <dig>  a nfiii/oct- <dig> recognition site  was identified within the itr of hadv- <dig> at nucleotides 40– <dig>  a sp <dig> binding site  was identified at nucleotides 73– <dig>  also, a nfi/ctfi  site was located at overlapping nucleotides 72– <dig> 

global pairwise alignment
the mvista limited area global alignment of nucleotides  tool was used to align and compare paired viral sequences  <cit> . we compared genomic sequence correspondence across the whole genome of hadv- <dig> to representative hadv serotypes from each of the six hadv species. comparison of the hadv- <dig> genome with that of hadv- <dig>  also within species d, showed a much higher degree of conservation than with representative hadvs from other species, but demonstrated disparity in the penton, hexon, e <dig>  and fiber regions .

early genes
e1a is the first transcriptional unit to be expressed during infection  <cit> . a common rna from this region is the source of several alternatively spliced e1a transcripts  <cit> . the e1a proteins regulate the transcription of viral and cellular genes  <cit> . based on splice donor and acceptor sites, two putative proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids with corresponding molecular weights of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively, were identified in the hadv- <dig> genome . the hadv- <dig> e1a  <dig>  kda protein is 89% identical and 96% similar to the hadv- <dig> homologue . a protein corresponding to the previously predicted 10s protein from previous studies of hadvs was not identified in our analysis. the predicted tata box was identified at nucleotide  <dig> and the polyadenylation signal predicted to be at position  <dig>

percent identities and similarities were calculated using fasta <dig> .

e1b proteins potentiate viral replication by blocking apoptosis. e1b 19k blocks the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by inactivating bak and bax  <cit> . e1b 55k inhibits the ability of p <dig>  the host tumor suppressor protein, to initiate cell cycle arrest  <cit> . the putative tata box for the e1b messages was predicted at nucleotide  <dig>  two predicted proteins of molecular weights of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda were identified within e1b which correspond to 19- and 55-kda proteins, respectively, as reported for hadv- <dig>  amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the predicted  <dig>  kda protein was 99% identical and 100% similar to the  <dig> kda homologue found in the hadv- <dig> genome . the polyadenylation signal for these transcripts was predicted at nucleotide  <dig> 

the e <dig> region of the genome consists of two transcription units, e2a and e2b, which encode three proteins that are required for viral replication  <cit> . these three proteins are known as the dna binding protein , terminal protein precursor , and dna polymerase. the e2a  <dig>  kda dna binding protein was identified on the complementary strand between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig>  also on the complementary strand, but located within the e2b region, we identified the ptp and dna polymerase. the polyadenylation signal for these transcripts was not identified.

the hadv e <dig> region encodes proteins that modulate the host immune response to infection but are not required for viral growth in vitro  <cit> . hadvs within species d have previously been suggested to encode eight orfs within the e <dig> region  <cit> . seven classical and one hypothetical e <dig> orfs were identified in our annotation of hadv- <dig>  the predicted molecular weights for these are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kda. the tata box was predicted at nucleotide  <dig> with a tataaa motif. one polyadenylation signal for this transcription unit was identified at nucleotide  <dig> 

open reading frames located in the e <dig> transcription unit produce proteins that have a wide variety of functions  <cit> . for example, e <dig> orf  <dig> and e <dig> orf  <dig> enhance the stability of late viral mrnas and increase their export from the nucleus thereby increasing viral mrna accumulation in the cytoplasm  <cit> . e <dig> orf  <dig> also binds to p <dig> and can block apoptosis  <cit> . we found  <dig> predicted orfs in hadv- <dig> located on the complementary strand. surprisingly, the e <dig> orf  <dig> from the hadv- <dig> genome was predicted at  <dig> amino acids in length corresponding to a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. in contrast, the hadv- <dig> homologue of e <dig> orf  <dig> is  <dig> amino acids in length, and contains three regions essential for tumor transformation . the e <dig> orf  <dig> of hadv- <dig> has structural similarity to other viral dutpase enzymes  <cit> . clustalw analysis of the hadv- <dig> e <dig> orf  <dig> compared to the hadv- <dig> homologue revealed a 100% similarity from residues 61– <dig>  including regions ii and iii and a truncated dutpase domain. further work will be needed to evaluate the significance of this truncation. the tata box for this region was identified at nucleotide  <dig> and the polyadenylation signal at nucleotide  <dig> 

intermediate genes
the intermediate genes of hadv are iva <dig> and ix. the iva <dig> protein interacts with l <dig> 52/55k during viral dna packaging, and assists in the activation of the major late promoter   <cit> . the hadv- <dig> iva <dig> gene, found on the complementary strand, was predicted using the splice site finder  <cit> , with a  <dig> amino acid protein and 99% amino acid homology to hadv- <dig> iva <dig>  the ix protein is a minor capsid protein and also assists in the activation of the major late promoter  <cit> . a coding sequence for a  <dig>  kda protein corresponding to ix was found at nucleotides 3454– <dig> 

late genes
the late transcription units of hadvs are transcribed from the mlp, which consists of an inverted caat box  and tata box . the late mrnas have been grouped into five families , based on the location of the polyadenylation signal. proteins expressed by these five families are involved in capsid production for mature virions  <cit> . the l <dig> transcription unit encodes two proteins, 52/55k and iiia. the 52/55k protein is involved in scaffolding of the capsid and therefore facilitates virus assembly  <cit> . the 52/55k protein also interacts with the intermediate gene product iva <dig> to facilitate dna packaging  <cit> . polypeptide iiia is a structural protein that has been located on the inner capsid surface below the penton base  <cit> . the 52/55k and polypeptide iiia in hadv- <dig> were predicted to have molecular weights of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively. the predicted polyadenylation signal for the l <dig> region was found at nucleotide  <dig> 

the proteins encoded on the l <dig> transcription unit also are involved in capsid formation  <cit> . the penton base  is found at each of the  <dig> vertices of the virion  <cit> . the penton base contains an arg-gly-asp  sequence which interacts with host integrins to induce internalization of the virus  <cit> . the hadv- <dig> penton base is located at nucleotides 13530– <dig>  the length of the protein was predicted to be  <dig> amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the rgd sequence was located at amino acid position 309– <dig>  the predicted protein was 100% identical to the previously published penton base protein identified for hadv- <dig>  <cit> . the hadv- <dig> penton base homologue is 90% identical and 95% similar to the predicted hadv- <dig> penton base protein . the v, vii, and x proteins constitute the hadv core proteins and facilitate packaging of viral dna within the capsid  <cit> . the hadv- <dig> pvii protein-coding sequence was identified at nucleotides 15093– <dig>  and the protein was predicted to have a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. proteins with an amino acid length of  <dig> and  <dig> were predicted in the hadv- <dig> genome for proteins v and x at nucleotides 15716– <dig> and 16750– <dig>  respectively. the l <dig> transcripts share a putative polyadenylation signal at nucleotide  <dig> 

three open reading frames corresponding to pvi, hexon, and protease proteins, with respective molecular weights of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kda, were identified within the l <dig> transcription unit. the pvi protein contains two nuclear export signals and two nuclear localization signals, and plays a role in transporting the hexon protein to the nucleus for viral assembly  <cit> . the c terminus of this protein has also been implicated in regulation of the viral protease  <cit> . the hadv- <dig> pvi protein was located at nucleotides 17030– <dig>  this predicted  <dig> amino acid protein was 100% identical to its hadv- <dig> homologue. the hexon protein, the most abundant virion component, constitutes  <dig> of the  <dig> subunits of the protein shell of the virus  <cit> . the hadv- <dig> hexon protein is  <dig> amino acids in length and was nearly identical to that predicted by ebner et al.  <cit> . our sequence data suggests an additional  <dig> amino acids on the n-terminus of the protein, similar to the predicted hexon gene for hadv- <dig> and hadv- <dig>  both within species d. the final protein encoded in the l <dig> transcription unit is the  <dig> kda viral protease protein. the hadv- <dig> homologue was predicted to be  <dig> amino acids in length. this protein cleaves other viral proteins allowing for assembly and viral maturation  <cit> , and the transcript shares a predicted polyadenylation signal at nucleotide  <dig> with other l <dig> transcripts.

three l <dig> proteins,  <dig> kda, pviii, and  <dig> kda, were predicted from our annotation. the  <dig> kda protein is a nonstructural protein that assists in the translation of late viral mrnas, and inhibits translation of cellular mrnas  <cit> . more recently this protein has been implicated as a scaffold for trimerization of the hexon  <cit> . the predicted  <dig> kda protein for hadv- <dig> genome was  <dig> amino acids in length and had a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. this protein is 98% identical to the published hadv- <dig>  <dig> kda protein. protein viii is a minor capsid protein that plays a role in the stability of the virion capsid  <cit> . the pviii protein of hadv- <dig> is  <dig>  kda in molecular weight and has a 99% identity to the published hadv- <dig> pviii protein. the  <dig> kda protein is involved in the packaging of hadv dna  <cit> . a  <dig> kda homologue was identified in hadv- <dig> with a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids and molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. its highest percent identity was to the hadv- <dig>  <dig> kda protein . the predicted polyadenylation signal for the l <dig> transcription unit is at nucleotide  <dig> 

the l <dig> region of the hadv genome consists entirely of the fiber protein gene. fiber protein trimerizes to produce the functional unit which projects from the  <dig> penton vertices of the virus capsid. the fiber protein's carboxyl -terminal globular domain, known as the fiber knob, acts as the primary ligand for host cell receptor binding. the hadv- <dig> fiber genome sequence was previously reported, and our predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids was identical  <cit> . the hadv- <dig> fiber was only 76% identical and 89% similar to its homologue in the hadv- <dig> genome . the polyadenylation signal for this transcript was predicted at nucleotide  <dig>  nucelotide sequence encoding a potential heparan binding site, previously reported in the fiber shaft of hadv- <dig>  was not present in the hadv- <dig> fiber gene  <cit> .

virus-associated rna
most hadvs contain two virus-associated  rna genes, va rnai and va rnaii. va rnai acts against cellular antiviral defense by blocking the activation of the protein kinase pkr, which when activated turns off protein synthesis in infected cells  <cit> . va rnaii binds to rna helicase a and nf <dig>  the latter a component of the nuclear factor of activated t cells   <cit> . these va rnas also have been recently shown to suppress rna interference  <cit> . the va rna genes for hadv- <dig> were previously identified  <cit> . our sequence for va rnai is located at nucleotides 10253– <dig> and is 99% identical to the previously reported sequence, differing by only one base pair. va rnaii is located at nucleotides 10471– <dig> and was 100% identical to that previously reported.

protein and phylogenetic analysis
the annotation of the hadv- <dig> genome allows for its comparison with other hadv serotypes within species d as well as serotypes from other species. percent identity and similarity of predicted proteins from each of the major transcription units were identified for representative serotypes using fasta <dig>  <cit> , and are shown in table  <dig>  in this analysis, highest identities outside of species d were seen with species b  and species e  viruses. projected protein sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis   <dig> . bootstrap confirmed neighbor joining trees also suggested that outside of hadv species d, the serotypes phylogenetically closest to hadv- <dig> were within hadv species b and e . we further selected specific proteins for analysis by virtual 2d gel   <cit> , based on clustalw alignments of predicted protein amino acid sequences comparing serotypes from different hadv species. the accuracy of these virtual 2d gels with regards to pi has been judged to be within ±  <dig> pi unit of the true migration of the physical protein, even when subsequent post-translational modifications are taken into account  <cit> .

migration patterns for select protein homologues in the virtual 2d gel showed projected differences in size and/or pi . the hadv- <dig> dna binding protein migrated to a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig>  . the range of pi for the dna binding protein among all serotypes tested was from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the dna polymerase homologues also revealed substantial differences in predicted size among the selected serotypes, and a range in pi from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . hadv- <dig> and hadv- <dig> polymerase both migrated to a predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kda with pi's of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the hadv- <dig> homologue had a predicted pi of  <dig> . the predicted molecular weights of the penton and hexon proteins differed between serotypes by less than  <dig> kda, with a pi range that was probably within the range of accuracy of the software . the l <dig> protease homologues migrated to almost identical areas on the virtual gel , consistent with very high percent similarity between hadv- <dig> protease and the other homologues . in contrast, despite high percent similarity in the pviii protein between hadv- <dig> and hadv- <dig> , the predicted hadv- <dig> pviii migrated to a pi of  <dig> , while the hadv- <dig> pviii migrated to a pi of  <dig>  . further review of the clustalw alignment for these  <dig> homologues revealed that despite their high similarity, there were  <dig> specific amino acid differences in hadv- <dig> that when changed to match the residues in hadv- <dig>  resulted in a pi for hadv- <dig> of  <dig>  .

molecular weight and pi were calculated using jvirgel  <dig> .3b

hypothetical proteins
during annotation of hadv- <dig>  we located  <dig> hypothetical orfs similar to orfs predicted from sequences previously archived in genbank for other hadvs , with a blast value for each of less than e- <dig>  genemark identified one of these putative proteins , and jcvi's annotation engine identified another , while the rest were identified by ncbi's orf finder. four of the  <dig> proteins were located on the complementary strand and  <dig> were clustered in the area between the intermediate and late orfs.

blast results were obtained by blastp using default parameters.

discussion
we have determined the complete  <dig>  base pair genome of hadv- <dig> and identified  <dig> putative adenoviral genes along with  <dig> hypothetical orfs conserved with at least one other hadv for each orf. comparison of the hadv- <dig> genome to that of hadv- <dig>  another species d virus, identified areas of substantial divergence in the penton, hexon, e <dig>  and fiber regions. disparities between these two hadv species d viruses in genes encoding structural and host receptor-binding proteins were somewhat expected and also consistent with known differences in host tissue tropism, for example the propensity of hadv- <dig> to cause corneal infection, as compared to the association of hadv- <dig> with urethritis and follicular conjunctivitis  <cit> . differences between hadv- <dig> and  <dig> in the e <dig> region, known to be important to immune evasion and regulation by the virus, but not essential to viral replication in vitro, suggest as yet undiscovered functions for this region  <cit> . divergence in the e <dig> region, possibly relevant to cellular and tissue specificity during infection, might be due to positive selection. sequencing of other hadvs within species d would provide further insight into this area of the hadv genome.

by phylogenetic analyses and paired comparisons of predicted proteins, hadv- <dig> and hadv- <dig> of species d appeared most closely related to hadv- <dig> of species b and hadv- <dig> of species e. subsequent virtual 2d gel analyses suggested that for a few proteins, a relatively few amino acid substitutions between otherwise similar proteins conferred significant effects on protein charge. if our analyses prove correct, such differences suggest that the function of such proteins in hadv species d could be quite different than previously described for serotypes of other hadv species. we acknowledge that our predictions represent a first approximation of protein characteristics, and could be subject to over-interpretation for at least two reasons. first, our comparisons to other viruses are only as reliable as the quality of genbank viral sequence and annotation. secondly, post-translational modifications may alter both charge and molecular weight of any given protein. actual 2d gel analysis will be necessary to confirm such predicted differences.

there is growing concern over the accuracy of in silico orf prediction in advs due to splice variants, as well as inconsistencies in banked annotations  <cit> . to address such concerns, we compared hadv- <dig> annotation using three different methods: ncbi orf finder, jcvi's annotation engine, and genemark heuristic model. we narrowed our annotation to  <dig> orfs by comparison with previously determined adenoviral annotations, but we consider our annotation provisional. we identified  <dig> hypothetical orfs similar to those previously identified in other hadv species. the very suggestion of hypothetical proteins implies that our understanding of the hadv is far from complete. transcriptome analysis using viral microarrays may help to clarify the best annotation  <cit> . we suggest that the true transcriptome and proteome of hadv- <dig> remain to be determined.

future sequencing of hadvs may permit new insights into viral origin, evolution, and pathogenesis. recently, hadv- <dig> was isolated for the first time from an outbreak of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. the hadv- <dig> isolate was shown to contain both hadv- <dig> fiber gene and hadv- <dig> penton base gene  <cit> . these recombination events apparently conferred corneal tropism to hadv- <dig>  a virus not normally known to infect the cornea. as more hadv species d viruses are sequenced, new insights into tropism and pathogenesis are likely to emerge.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the complete genome sequence of hadv- <dig> was determined and annotated. the organization of the hadv- <dig> genome is similar to other human species d adenoviruses except in the penton, hexon, e <dig>  and fiber regions. phylogenetic analysis of hadv- <dig> proteins revealed close relation to species b and e human adenoviruses, while virtual 2d gel analysis identified differences in proteins thought to function similarly. the availability of the hadv- <dig> complete genome sequence will facilitate future studies into the pathogenicity of this important human pathogen.
