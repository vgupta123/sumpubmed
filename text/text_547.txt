BACKGROUND
the mechanisms underlying the acquisition and maintenance of apical cell polarity are beginning to be understood and the importance of cell polarity in development is now widely appreciated. drosophila crumbs  and vertebrate crumbs orthologues are important determinants of apical polarity and are critical for epithelial morphology  <cit> . the establishment of cell polarity within the developing retinal neuroepithelium is crucial for normal retinal development, as zebrafish with loss-of-function mutations in the polarity determinants apkcλ/heart and soul , pals1/mpp5/nagie oko , crb2a/oko meduzy , and mosaic eyes , fail to properly form cell-specific laminae  <cit> . in addition, ablation of apkcλ in differentiating photoreceptors in a conditional knockout mouse results in a loss of retinal lamination  <cit> .

crumbs proteins are also important for normal photoreceptor morphogenesis and zonula adherens/adherens junction formation and/or maintenance in drosophila  <cit> . in humans, mutations in the crumbs homologue- <dig>  gene cause retinal degeneration diseases  <cit> . mouse models lacking functional crb <dig> exhibit a compromised outer limiting membrane  in the retina and defects in photoreceptor morphology  <cit> . furthermore, data from our lab and others have implicated the crumbs complex as a key regulator of apical membrane size in photoreceptors  <cit> .

the moe mutant was discovered in a zebrafish mutagenesis screen, and the moe mutations affect retinal lamination, brain ventricle formation, and heart and body morphology  <cit> . orthologues have been identified in drosophila  and mammals   <cit> . the yurt and epb <dig> l <dig> locus encode four and two isoforms respectively  <cit> . we and our colleagues have shown that moe and moe orthologues form a complex with crumbs proteins that is mediated by the ferm domain, and this interaction is important for crumbs protein function  <cit> . the mouse mutant lulu has a null-allele mutation in epb <dig> l <dig>  and has defects in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cells at the primitive streak and abnormal neural plate morphology that is accompanied by defects in the actin-cytoskeleton  <cit> . in this study we use a comparative genomic and proteomic approach to identify functionally important sequences within moe and epb <dig> l <dig> by testing whether injection of mrna encoding the long and short isoforms of epb <dig> l <dig>  can functionally substitute for moe function in zebrafish. we further investigate the role of moe within different tissues by defining what epb <dig> l <dig> domains are necessary to rescue distinct moe- defects. lastly, we report the histological and morphological consequences of losing epb <dig> l5long protein in the rescued zebrafish retina after the depletion of rescue construct.

RESULTS
injection of moe mrna rescues embryonic defects in moe- mutants
we tested whether injecting moe mrna into moe- embryos could rescue embryonic and early larval defects. we found that injection of wild-type moe mrna into moe- mutant embryos at the 1– <dig> cell-stage rescued brain ventricle formation, retinal pigmented epithelial  integrity, and retinal neural epithelial integrity and straightened the tail at  <dig> hours post fertilization  . we observed no abnormalities in injected wild-type embryos . pericardial edema in moe- mutants was only partially rescued by moe mrna injection . the remaining pericardial edema was a convenient marker, however, and made it possible to easily distinguish between wild-type larvae and rescued moe- mutants, but we also confirmed that embryos were moe- mutants by labeling with anti-moe antibodies at  <dig> hpf and comparing labeling to wildtypes and uninjected moe- mutants . in moe mrna injected moe- mutants very little anti-moe labeling was observed except background . the weak anti-moe labeling in moe mrna injected moe- mutants suggests very little moe protein encoded by the injected mrna remains at  <dig> hpf.

we have shown that moe interacts with crumbs proteins, which are important apical polarity determinants and that moe loss-of-function results in a failure to localize crb2a and the junctional protein zo- <dig> at the apical surface of the retina and brain  <cit> . we examined whether injection of moe mrna into moe- mutants could rescue the apical localization of crumbs proteins and zo- <dig> in the retina and brain. in order to examine crumbs proteins in zebrafish, we used an antibody we raised against the highly conserved c' terminal peptide and because this antibody recognizes all zebrafish crumbs proteins by western blot  we call this antibody a pancrb antibody. in wild-type embryos at  <dig> hpf, anti-pancrb and anti-zo- <dig> labeling localize to the apical/ventricle surface in the brain, and the apical surface and the newly forming outer limiting membrane in the retina . in moe- mutants, brain ventricles fail to form properly, and pancrb and zo- <dig> fail to localize to the apical surfaces in the brain and retina . injection of moe mrna into moe- mutants leads to the apical relocalization of crumbs proteins and zo- <dig> in the retina and brain .

conservation between moe and mouse epb <dig> l5
to help identify functionally important domains in the moe and epb <dig> l <dig> proteins, we first compared their sequences . the mammalian epb <dig> l <dig> locus encodes two major splice isoforms that are represented by ests in both the human and mouse databases, which we term epb <dig> l5short and epb <dig> l5long. we provide the exon/intron structure of the mouse epb <dig> l <dig> locus that has  <dig> exons: epb <dig> l5short is encoded by exons 1– <dig> and epb <dig> l5long by exons 1– <dig> and 17– <dig> . we have not found a zebrafish transcript that encodes a protein similar to epb <dig> l5short.

a comparison between moe and mouse epb <dig> l5long shows very strong homology in the ferm domain , and there is also strong conservation flanking the ferm domain  as well as additional islands of strong conservation, notably a class i pdz-binding domain  at the c' terminus of both proteins . homology between moe and epb <dig> l5short ends at amino acid  <dig> , after which epb <dig> l5short has  <dig> unique amino acids . epb <dig> l5short is predicted to be  <dig> kda, and interestingly also has a predicted binding motif for a class i pdz domain at its c' terminus .

we raised isoform-specific antibodies against the unique c' terminal sequences of the long and short isoform of epb <dig> l <dig> and used them for western analysis of mouse tissue. we observed two bands that were immunoreactive with epb <dig> long anti-sera. a protein that migrated at approximately  <dig> kda was present in eye, brain, heart, lung, kidney, and testis tissue . there was an additional protein recognized in all tissues at  <dig> kda, which is probably non-specific reactivity. two proteins were detected with anti-epb <dig> l5short affinity-purified antibody. one protein migrated at the expected molecular weight of  <dig> kda and was present in brain, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, and gut. a second protein migrating at approximately  <dig> kda was broadly expressed. this higher molecular weight protein may represent a post-translationally modified form of epb <dig> l5short or more likely is non-specific reactivity .

functional comparative genomics reveals important domains in moe/epb <dig> l5
to identify functionally important sequences in the moe and orthologous protein epb <dig> l <dig>  we tested whether injection of mouse epb <dig> l5long mrna could substitute for moe and rescue moe- mutant defects. we injected epb <dig> l5long mrna into 1– <dig> cell moe- embryos and found that it rescued brain ventricle formation, retinal pigmented epithelial integrity, and retinal lamination and straightened the tail like injection of moe mrna . injection of epb <dig> l5long also rescued apical localization of zo- <dig> and anti-pancrb labeling in the retina and brain . using antibodies we raised against the unique sequence in epb <dig> l5long, we found that epb <dig> l5long protein in mrna injected moe- mutants localized cortically like endogenous moe in wild-type embryos . because all the proteins shown to interact with moe do so through its ferm domain  <cit> , we tested whether injection of epb <dig> l <dig> mrna encoding a myc-tagged ferm domain  could rescue moe- mutant defects like full length moe and epb <dig> l5long mrna injection. injection of epb <dig> l5ferm mrna at the 1– <dig> cell stage failed to rescue the defects in moe- mutants  and did not lead to apical relocalization of zo- <dig> and anti-pancrb labeling . we also ruled out the possibility that the n' terminal myc-tag interfered with protein function by showing that epb <dig> l5long myc-tagged at its n' terminus was still able to rescue moe- mutant defects as well as untagged epb <dig> l5long 

wild-type embryos or embryos from heterozygous moe+/- incrosses were injected with the indicated mrna constructs and scored based on pericardial edema, brain ventricle defects, rpe defects, apical localization of zo- <dig> or crb2a at  <dig> hpf, and retinal lamination at  <dig> dpf. phenotypes that were not analyzed are indicated with an na. * see figure 4m, n and text.

we next tested whether injection of mrna encoding epb <dig> l5short could rescue moe- mutant defects since it is identical to epb <dig> l5long until amino acid  <dig> after which there are ~ <dig> unique amino acids that end with a predicted pdz binding domain that is the same class as that in moe and epb <dig> l5long. injection of mrna encoding epb <dig> l5short into moe- mutants at the 1– <dig> cell stage failed to rescue moe- mutant embryonic defects and failed to apically relocalize zo- <dig> and anti-pancrb labeling in the retina or brain . epb <dig> l5short labeling with the epb <dig> l5short specific antibodies appears more cytoplasmic in injected moe- mutants .

because many proteins with pdz domains have been implicated in the establishment of cell polarity, we asked whether the pdz-binding domain in epb <dig> l5long is necessary for its function. we injected mrna constructs encoding epb <dig> l5long with the pbd deleted , epb <dig> l5long where its pbd is replaced by pbd from epb <dig> l5short  and epb <dig> l5short where its pbd is replaced by the pbd from epb <dig> l5long . injection of epb <dig> l5long_Δpbd mrna failed to rescue crb2a and zo- <dig> apical localization in the retina or rescue brain ventricle formation . however, injection of epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd or epb <dig> l5short+long_pbd mrnas did lead to apical relocalization of zo- <dig> and anti-pancrb labeling .

we confirmed that protein was expressed from each of the template rescue mrnas by western analysis of injected zebrafish. epb <dig> l5long and epb <dig> short were not detectable at time points beyond  <dig> and  <dig> hpf respectively . both epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd and epb <dig> l5short+long_pbd were expressed at  <dig> hpf and faint signal was visible at  <dig> hpf. neither epb <dig> l5ferm nor epb <dig> l5long_Δpbd were detectable at time points beyond  <dig> hpf , therefore a failure to rescue any moe- defects in these cases may be due to a rapid loss of the protein generated by rescue constructs.

analysis of rescue with chimeric epb <dig> l <dig> pbd isoforms
at  <dig> hpf, mutant moe- embryos exhibit reduced or absent brain ventricles, pericardial edema, and rpe defects . injection of epb <dig> l5short+long_pbd mrna restored rpe integrity  and retinal lamination  in moe- mutants, but did not rescue the edema, brain ventricles were small or absent, and the tail curved .

in a heterozygous moe+/- incross, a roughly mendelian inheritance  of individuals injected with epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd mrna exhibited rpe defects; however, in all but one case, those defects were minor compared to uninjected moe- mutants and their detection required very careful examination . the severity of rpe defects varies in uninjected moe- mutants: an examination of  <dig> uninjected moe- mutants showed that  <dig> had mild rpe defects ,  <dig> had moderate rpe defects , and  <dig> had severe rpe defects . the shift in severity of rpe defects from mostly moderate in moe- mutants to nearly normal in injected moe- mutants, suggests that injection of epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd mrna largely restores rpe integrity.

because epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd largely restored rpe integrity in moe- mutants we examined whether retinal lamination was also restored in these individuals. at  <dig> dpf, in wildtypes, gpf+ rods are localized adjacent to the rpe . in moe- mutants, gpf+ rods are ectopically localized throughout the retina, regardless of the severity of rpe defects . in moe- mutants injected with of epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd mrna, most gpf+ rods localize normally and are adjacent to the rpe. .

when we injected epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd mrna into embryos resulting from an incross of moe-/+ individuals, we observed that more than 25% exhibited edema, suggesting that injection of epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd mrna has a tissue-dependent dominant negative effect. we determined that 61% of embryos had pericardial edema and 96% had small or missing brain ventricles . we next injected epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd mrna into embryos from a wildtype incross and found a large proportion of these individuals exhibited pericardial edema and brain ventricle defects, but the rpe was normal, confirming that the dominant negative effects of epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd are limited to edema and brain ventricle formation . lastly, epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd retains immunoreactivity with the anti-epb <dig> l5long sera, and we show that the protein localizes cortically like epb <dig> l5long , suggesting that the epb <dig> l5long pbd is not required for cortical localization.

early epb <dig> l <dig> function rescues later retinal lamination and function
because mrna injection could rescue early moe- mutant defects, we investigated whether later defects of retinal development were also rescued, in particular, whether differentiated cells acquired their correct laminar position and photoreceptors their normal morphology. we compared the retinas of  <dig> dpf wildtypes, moe- mutants, and moe- mutants injected with moe or epb <dig> l5long mrna . the western blot experiments and immunohistochemistry  showed that there is very little, if any, remaining epb <dig> l5long protein after  <dig> dpf , the time at which most photoreceptors begin to undergo morphogenesis. in wild-type retinas, nuclei are arranged in distinct layers, müller glia are radially oriented and project to and contribute to the inner  and outer  limiting membranes of the retina, and rods and double cones display a polarized morphology with their outer segments projecting into the rpe . in moe- mutants, nuclei do not form distinct layers and the numbers of müller glia, rods and double cones are reduced and their morphology is abnormal, although interestingly rods do make outer segments .

whereas müller glial morphology and retinal lamination are rescued in moe- mutants by injection of either moe or epb <dig> long mrna, the morphology of photoreceptors  is not; instead of standing perpendicular to the normal rpe , those in moe- mutants injected with either moe or epb <dig> long mrna, lie collapsed in a twisted heap adjacent to the rpe . the failure to rescue photoreceptor morphology is likely because moe or epb <dig> long protein from injected mrna is lost by the time photoreceptors undergo morphogenesis.

previously, we showed in genetic mosaics that the outer segments of rods lacking moe function are larger than those in wild-type rods  <cit> . we sought to determine whether outer segments are also larger in rods in larvae where all cells have lost moe function by about  <dig> dpf. we measured the size of rod outer segments using anti-rhodopsin labeling. we found that rods in rescued moe- mutants  were significantly larger than rods in wild-type retinas at  <dig> dpf, whereas, rods in moe- mutants were significantly smaller than those in wild-type retinas .

we also tested whether injection of epb <dig> l5long mrna could restore vision to moe- mutants as measure by the optokinetic response . the okr measures the tracking of the eyes to a moving stimulus  <cit> . in our study the stimulus consisted of alternating white and black vertical bars moving to the right on a projection screen and we measured tracked eye movements  in response to the stimulus over a minute time period. we measured tm in wild-type, moe- mutants, and epb <dig> l5long mrna injected moe- mutant larvae immobilized in methylcellulose at  <dig> dpf. we found that wild-type larvae exhibited an average of  <dig>   tm/minute, moe- mutants completely lacked tm, and epb <dig> l <dig> mrna injected moe- mutant larvae had an average of  <dig>   tm/minute . thus, even though photoreceptors have morphological defects in epb <dig> l5long mrna injection into moe- mutants many of these larvae have functional vision as measured by the optokinetic response.

crb2a/b protein localization and outer limiting membrane integrity requires moe function, but rod outer segment disc stacking does not
we recently showed that moe is an important regulator of crumbs protein localization in the embryo  <cit> , so we were interested in whether moe function is also required at later stages in the retina for crumbs protein localization. crb2a and crb2b are the only crumbs proteins shown to be expressed by zebrafish photoreceptors  <cit>  and the antibodies we use recognize both proteins . the ability to rescue the embryonic defects and retinal lamination with moe or epb <dig> l5long injection allows us to ask whether the localization of crb2a/b in photoreceptors also requires moe function. the western blot analysis indicates very little, if any, epb <dig> l5long protein remains after  <dig> dpf in moe- mrna injected individuals, so we can examine retinas in moe- mutant larvae where early defects have been rescued but where there is no endogenous moe and little, if any, exogenous epb <dig> l5long protein after  <dig> dpf. we examined the localization of crb2a/b in wild-type, moe- mutant, and epb <dig> l5long mrna injected moe- mutant larvae at  <dig> dpf. in the wild-type retina, crb2a/b localizes just apical to the outer limiting membrane , which is labeled by anti-zo- <dig> antibodies . in moe- mutants, very little crb2a/b protein is detected in the area surrounding gfp+ rod photoreceptors, zo- <dig> labeling is highly disorganized suggesting the olm has not formed, and there is no spatial relationship between crb2a/b and zo- <dig> . in epb <dig> l5long mrna injected moe- mutants, crb2a/b labeling is evident, but reduced compared to wild-type retinas, and like moe- mutants, zo- <dig> labeling is disorganized indicating the absence of the olm, and we also observed no spatial relationship between crb2a/b and zo- <dig> .

although labeling of rods with anti-rhodopsin antibodies in moe- mutant and epb <dig> l5long mrna injected moe- mutant larvae suggest that outer segments form , we wanted to determine whether these outer segments were normal ultrastructurally, in particular, whether disk morphology and packing is normal. we examined outer segments by transmission electron microscopy  at  <dig> dpf in wild-type, moe- mutant and epb <dig> l5long mrna injected moe- mutant larvae. we found that disk morphology and packing appeared relatively normal in photoreceptors in moe- mutants and epb <dig> l5long mrna injected moe- mutants .

discussion
in this study we sought to identify functionally important domains in the orthologous ferm proteins, zebrafish moe and mouse epb <dig> l <dig>  our strategy was to use evolution, comparative genomics, and protein engineering to discover regions and sequences necessary for rescue of embryonic and early larval defects in moe deficient zebrafish. we first established that injection of wild-type moe mrna into moe- embryos rescued all embryonic defects with the exception that mild pericardial edema persisted. in mammalian est databases there are two major splice isoforms of epb <dig> l <dig>  epb <dig> l5long that is  <dig> amino acids in length and is similar in length and shares sequence identity with moe beyond the ferm domain  and epb <dig> l5short that is  <dig> amino acids. these two isoforms are identical until amino acid  <dig> and interestingly both contain a predicted pdz-binding domain at their c' terminus. we raised isoform-specific antibodies and examined expression of the two orthologues by western blot of different mouse tissues. both antibodies recognized a protein of about  <dig> kda in all tissues, which is likely to be non-specific reactivity. anti-epb <dig> l5long recognized a protein of the expected molecular weight of about  <dig> kda in eye, brain, heart, lung, kidney and testis; this expression profile agrees well with recently published immunohistochemical and mrna expression  data in mammalian retinal, brain, and kidney tissues  <cit> . anti-epb <dig> l5short recognized protein of the expected molecular weight of about  <dig> kda in brain, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, spleen and gut. not all tissues expressed both isoforms, for instance epb <dig> l5long but not epb <dig> l5short is found in the eye and epb <dig> l5short but not epb <dig> l5long is found in the gut, suggesting that the two isoforms may have non-overlapping functions.

we tested whether either of these epb <dig> l <dig> isoforms could functionally substitute for moe during embryonic and early larval development. injection of mrna encoding epb <dig> l5long into moe- mutants rescues moe- mutant defects and leads to the restoration of retinal lamination, rpe integrity, normal brain ventricle morphology, and the apical localization of crumbs proteins and zo- <dig> in the developing retina and brain, similar to injection of moe mrna. like injection of moe mrna into moe- mutants, mild pericardial edema persisted in these epb <dig> l5long mrna injected moe- mutants. we found that injection of epb <dig> l5short mrna into moe- mutants failed to rescue any phenotypic defects and also failed to relocalize crumbs proteins and zo- <dig> to the apical surface of the retina and brain. interestingly, while exogenous epb <dig> l5long protein is cortically localized in neuroepithelial cells similar to endogenous moe protein, epb <dig> l5short is localized cytoplasmically, suggesting that either the pbds or sequences unique to epb <dig> l5long underlie epb <dig> l5long protein localization.

although edema was reduced in moe- mutants by injection of moe or epb <dig> l5long mrna, it was never abolished by mrna injection. we presume that the edema in moe- mutants is caused by kidney dysfunction. there are several possible reasons for failure of mrna injection to rescue kidney function. it is possible that moe/epb <dig> l5long function is required for a longer period of time or perhaps continually in the kidney and protein from injected mrna is not around long enough completely restore kidney function. a second possibility is that the moe and epb <dig> l5long constructs we used lack the sequence needed to rescue kidney function. if this is the case, then those specific sequence do not seem to reside in epb <dig> l5short, since injection of epb <dig> l5short mrna failed to rescue any pericardial edema, and the severity of edema was as severe as uninjected moe- mutants. there are, however, many minor splice variants of moe and epb <dig> l5long in the zebrafish and mammalian est databases.

because all the proteins so far identified that interact with moe and epb <dig> l <dig>  do so via the ferm domain  <cit> , we tested whether expression of a epb <dig> l <dig> construct encoding the first  <dig> amino acids , which includes the ferm domain, could rescue apical crumbs proteins and zo- <dig> localization or any defects in moe- mutants. this construct failed to rescue apical crumbs protein and zo- <dig> localization and any moe- defects, however, we could not detect epb <dig> l5ferm protein after  <dig> hpf, suggesting that this mrna or protein is unstable. the same result was observed when the pdz-binding domain in epb <dig> l5long was deleted ; there was no phenotypic rescue in moe- mutants and no apical crumbs protein and zo- <dig>  and we did not detect epb <dig> l5long_Δpbd protein after  <dig> hpf. these observations suggest that the pdz-binding domain might be important for stability of moe/epb <dig> l <dig> protein.

pdz domains are important mediators of protein interactions and have been shown to be important during the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity  <cit> . we sought to identify the importance of the pdz-binding domain in epb <dig> l5long by replacing it with the pdz-domain from epb <dig> l5short to generate the chimeric protein epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd and by replacing the pdz-domain in epb <dig> l5short with the pdz-domain from epb <dig> l5long to generate the epb <dig> l5short+long_pbd chimera. we found that injection of epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd or epb <dig> l5short+long_pbd mrna into moe- mutants rescued apical localization of crumbs proteins and zo- <dig> in the retinal and brain neuroepithelium, rpe integrity , and retinal lamination, but did not rescue brain ventricle morphology. furthermore, injection of epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd mrna into wild-type embryos caused a dominant negative phenotype-brain ventricles were small or failed to form. these observations have revealed important insights into the function of moe/epb <dig> l <dig> and suggest that both the pdz-binding domain of moe/epb <dig> l5long and additional internal sequences in the c'terminal domain moe/epb <dig> l5long  are important for the localization of zo- <dig> and crumbs proteins, rpe integrity and retinal lamination.

several observations support the importance of both the pdz-binding domain of epb <dig> l5long and internal sequences in epb <dig> l5long. the importance of the pdz domain in epb <dig> l5long is shown by the experiment where injection into moe- mutants of the chimeric construct epb <dig> l5short+long_pbd, in which the pdz-binding domain of epb <dig> l5short is replaced by the pdz-binding domain from epb <dig> l5long, rescues apical zo- <dig> and pancrb, retinal lamination and rpe integrity, whereas, injection of epb <dig> l5short mrna does not. this result suggests that there is some specificity between the pbd of epb <dig> l5long and the pbd of epb <dig> l5short. the importance of the internal sequence in epb <dig> l5long  is shown by the experiment where injection into moe- mutants of the chimeric construct epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd, in which in which the pdz-binding domain of epb <dig> l5long is replaced by the pdz-binding domain from epb <dig> l5short, rescues apical zo- <dig> and pancrb, retinal lamination and mostly rpe integrity, whereas, injection of epb <dig> l5short mrna does not. unexpectedly, injection of epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd mrna into wild-type embryos caused a dominant phenotype that included brain ventricle defects and edema that are similar to those in moe- mutants. one possibility is that epb <dig> l5long+short_pbd competes with endogenous moe and takes a protein necessary for brain ventricle formation away from the crumbs complex. taken together, our experiments have suggested that moe/epb <dig> l <dig> proteins are modular proteins and that the pdz-binding domains have specificity in some tissues.

moe and other cell polarity determinants, crb2a/ome, apkcλ, and nok, are required for proper lamination of the zebrafish retina  <cit> . the time at which these proteins are needed for lamination has not been determined. since we see very little moe or epb <dig> l5long protein after  <dig> hpf, we suggest that early moe or epb <dig> l5long function is sufficient to rescue retinal lamination and function. in moe or epb <dig> l5long injected moe- mutants at  <dig> dpf, müller glial cell processes are properly oriented and span the thickness of the retina, and the retina has distinct nuclear layers. furthermore, the vast majority of rod and double cone photoreceptors localize correctly to outer most portion of the retina to form an outer nuclear layer.

immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis of epb <dig> l5long rescued moe- mutant retinas, revealed that rescued rods form outer segments, but they were not always oriented with their outer segments toward the rpe . this may be a consequence of the failure of the rescued individuals to establish or maintain the olm . despite the morphological defects of rods and cones in the moe- mutants injected with epb <dig> l5long mrna, many of these larvae are visually competent as tested by optokinetic response. interestingly, our ultrastructural analysis revealed that moe- rods formed outer segments, complete with organized membranous discs, suggesting that mechanisms that dictate apical opsin transport and disc formation do not require moe function.

previously, we showed that moe function is required for the localization of crb2a and zo- <dig> protein at the apical surface of the developing retina in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . we show here that in the wild type retina at  <dig> dpf, anti-pancrb labeling localizes just above the olm in the subapical region. in moe- photoreceptors, anti-pancrb labeling is not detectible, and zo- <dig> appears disorganized. when we examined photoreceptors in epb <dig> l5long mrna rescued moe- mutants at  <dig> dpf, which is several days after detectable epb <dig> l5long protein, we observed that both zo- <dig> and crumbs proteins are present in the photoreceptor region . the design of our rescue experiment allowed us to analyze the localization of crumbs proteins and zo- <dig> in rescued moe- photoreceptors several days after exogenous epb <dig> l5long was gone. in epb <dig> l5long mrna injected moe- mutants, zo- <dig> and pancrb labeling is not normal and mislocalized ectopic plagues of zo- <dig> and pancrb labeling appears to be at the interface of photoreceptors, and/or photoreceptors and müller glia and there is no clear relationship between zo- <dig> and anti-pancrb labeling. thus, epb <dig> l5/more function is required to maintain, or establish, the olm and the localization of crumbs proteins relative to it.

we measured the size of rod outer segments in moe- mutants that had been injected with epb <dig> l5long mrna but that lack measurable moe protein during photoreceptor morphogenesis, and found that these genetically moe-deficient rods were nearly twice the normal size . this observation is in agreement with previous data from our lab and others implicating moe and the drosophila orthologue, yurt, as negative regulators of apical membrane size in photoreceptors  <cit> . we observed that in uninjected moe- mutants, rod outer segments are smaller than wild-types , this could be a consequence of the general ill health of moe mutants at  <dig> dpf, and/or the isolation of photoreceptors from factors secreted by the rpe and müller glia  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our strategy to use comparative genomics and protein engineering has revealed that the function of moe/epb <dig> l <dig> protein is modular and that particular regions can be assigned particular functions. we also show that the c' terminal domain that encodes the pdz-binding domain in moe and epb <dig> l5long is important but not sufficient to confer full protein function to the ferm domain and that other sequences in moe and epb <dig> l5long are important. the next challenge will be to identify the pdz-containing protein that interacts with the pdz-binding domain in moe/epb <dig> l5long and the additional protein that interact with the unique sequences in epb <dig> l5long. although the role of the crumbs complex in epithelial morphogenesis has been much studied, the molecular mechanism of the crumbs complex function is still unknown. the identification of additional proteins that interact with moe/epb <dig> l5long may help to determine the mechanistic function of the crumbs complex.
