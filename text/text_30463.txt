BACKGROUND
transfer-messenger rna , also known as 10sa rna or ssra rna, is a hybrid of a trna-like domain  and a mrna-like domain  connected by a variable number of pseudoknots  <cit> . tmrna is a stable and essential component of trans-translation, a quality-control process that rescues ribosomes stalled on mrnas lacking stop codons. during trans-translation, ribosomes switch from a defective mrna  to the mld of tmrna. because a stop codon is provided by the tmrna, the ribosomes can dissociate and recycle  <cit> . as an additional advantage, the tandem translation of the two templates generates a tagged polypeptide which is degraded by housekeeping proteases  <cit> .

for tagging, tmrna has to be charged by aminoacyl-trna synthetases  <cit> . assisted by protein smpb, the charged tmrna is delivered to stalled ribosomes as a quaternary complex with ef-tu and gtp. binding of tmrna to ribosomes is facilitated by ribosomal protein s <dig>  which interacts with the mld and pseudoknots but not with the tld  <cit> . recently, cryo-em revealed the shape of the tmrna associated with smpb and ef-tu in its ribosome-bound form  <cit> . despite this significant progress, high-resolution structures as obtained by nmr and x-ray crystallography are unavailable and expected to be difficult to obtain in the foreseeable future due to the relatively large size and flexibility of the tmrna.

in the present work we used a stepwise procedure for arriving at high-resolution models for the entire tmrna molecule. first, 2-d structures were obtained by covariation analysis of a large number of tmrna sequences. the basepairing information was submitted to the erna-3d modeling program  <cit>  to build the helical sections. structural motifs of the loops and turns were identified in scor  <cit> , high-resolution data were extracted from known structures, and these data were incorporated into the models. overall, significantly improved 3-d models were obtained which will be useful to understand the role of tmrna in trans-translation. the described approach can be adapted to obtain high-resolution models of the members of other rna families.

RESULTS
identification of tmrna sequences
the tmrna sequences were identified previously and subjected to comparative sequence analysis  as described  <cit> . new tmrna sequences were obtained from the tmrna website  <cit> , through keyword searches of the literature and genbank  <cit> , or blast  <cit> , and various genome sequencing projects. the new sequences were examined iteratively as described in materials and methods to confirm tmrna identity, remove sequence duplications, and create a meaningful alignment.

new potential tmrna sequences were maintained as a preliminary alignment in bioedit  <cit> , separate embl-formatted sequence files, and a html-formatted phylogenetic list. the sequences were ordered phylogenetically using the information in the ribosomal database project   <cit> . if the organism name was not listed in the rdp, the sequence was placed next to its closest relative using the ncbi taxonomy resource  <cit> .

selection of tmrna sequences
the new sequences were confirmed individually as tmrnas by comparison with the closest relative using the pairwise alignment feature of bioedit  <cit> . if there was a lack of obvious similarity, the sequence was inspected for evidence of biological features such as the ability to form a tld and an open reading frame. furthermore, the possibility of a two-part tmrna was considered. a sequence suspected to be a new tmrna was investigated further by csa  <cit>  as described in materials and methods.

potential new sequences of the alpha-proteobacteria and some cyanobacteria that were encoded in two separate sections of their genes  <cit> , were compared to the two-part tmrna sequence from a closest relative for effective comparison with the one-part tmrnas. the 3'- and 5'-ends of each section were determined by pairwise alignment to generate a single sequence. each of the  <dig> new two-part tmrnas  was subjected to this rearrangement.

comparative sequence analysis
sequences were ordered phylogenetically using the rdp  <cit>  as a guide or by alignment with the closest relative. identical regions were aligned first. subsequently, similar regions were aligned using invariant positions as signposts. regions of biological significance, such as the resume and stop codons, were then considered. finally, common secondary structure features were used to align regions that lacked primary structure similarity or biological features. supported watson-crick basepairs and g-u interactions were indicated in the alignment by uppercase letters. gaps were introduced to account for differences in sequence length and to avoid the alignment of dissimilar regions.

secondary structure was determined using covariation analysis as described  <cit>  . the alignment was examined to identify compensatory base changes  and other covariations. the numbers of cbcs and mismatches between the alignment columns were counted. cbcs provided positive evidence for the existence of a basepair; mismatches provided negative evidence. if the number of compensatory base changes was two times or greater than the number of mismatches, the basepair was considered supported. if a basepair was invariant, no evidence for or against its existence could be gained from csa. a basepair was considered specific to a particular phylogenetic group if it was proven only in that group.

quality control
to check for the proper assignment of basepairs, the alignment was sent through an automated pipeline of programs from rnadbtools  <cit> . the output was inspected visually and corrections were made manually using the bioedit program  <cit> . the revised alignment was resubmitted to rnadbtools, and the review process was repeated until a satisfactory alignment was produced.

tmrna alignment
the final alignment contained a total of  <dig> tmrna sequences in  <dig> bacterial phylogenetic groups. a complete phylogenetic list is available at the tmrdb  <cit> . there was a substantial increase in the number of two-part tmrnas for a total of  <dig> sequences:  <dig> from alpha-proteobacteria , one mitochondrial tmrna, and six cyanobacterial tmrnas. the nine organelle sequences included one from a cyanelle, six from chloroplasts, one from a plastid, and one from the reclinomonas americana mitochondrion. the typical tmrna was about  <dig> nucleotides long. the r. americana mitochondrion tmrna contained only  <dig> nucleotides and, since it appeared to lack an orf, may not be functional. excluding this exception and any partial tmrnas, the tmrna of synechococcus species pcc <dig> was the shortest , and the longest was from chlamydophila psittaci . the tmrna alignment is provided as additional files 1: tmrna-alignment.html, 2: tmrna-alignment-wide.txt, 3:tmrna-alignment-92col.txt, and 4: tmrna-alignment.msf.

secondary structure of tmrna
the tmrna secondary structure features were extracted from the alignment and are listed in phylogenetic order in table  <dig>  the representative secondary structure of escherichia coli tmrna is shown in figure  <dig>  secondary structures of bacillus anthracis and caulobacter crescentus are presented in as additional file 5: banthracis2d.pdf and additional file 6: ccrescentus2d.pdf, respectively.

tld 
although a prominent feature of each tmrna, the tld was relatively weakly supported by csa due to a high degree of sequence conservation. however, the structure of this region is well established by experimental evidence  <cit> .

helix  <dig> contained seven basepairs and was usually continuous with the exception of the anabaena species tmrna, which contained an insertion in the 3'-portion of helix  <dig>  the first pair  was conserved with one exception in alcaligenes eutrophus where there was a 1u-c <dig> mismatch possibly due to a sequencing error. the second  and third pair  of helix  <dig> were invariant and therefore neither supported nor disproved by csa. the identities of the bases involved in the fourth  and fifth pair varied. the closing pair of helix  <dig>  was conserved with the exception of a 7u-a <dig> pair the trichodesmium erythraeum tmrna. the single-stranded region between helices  <dig> and 2a ranged from ten in dehalococcoides ethenogenes to  <dig> nucleotides in one clostridium acetobutylicum sequence. a u-a basepair  was possible in the r. americana mitochondrion tmrna.

helix 2a was equivalent to the anticodon stem of trna and contained eight supported basepairs as well as a short variable internal loop in the 5'half of the helix that occurred in a few sequences . the first position in the helix was a conserved cytosine  which formed a weakly-supported basepair with the conserved g <dig>  the partial tmrna from the chloroplast of pavlova lutheri contained a uracil in the first position, but no information regarding the 3'portion of helix 2a was available.

the t-loop and helix  <dig> were highly conserved, although many sequences lacked information about helix  <dig> due to primer annealing during pcr amplification. helix  <dig> contained four strongly supported basepairs and a fifth conserved g-c pair . the dehalococcoides ethenogenes tmrna had the potential to form a sixth basepair in helix  <dig>  helix  <dig> was almost always continuous, except for the tmrna of carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans which possessed four basepairs and a mismatched u <dig> and c <dig>  a 331-gg- <dig> preceded u <dig> in c. hydrogenoformans and followed the conserved 328-gac- <dig>  therefore, u <dig> was unlikely to pair. in the t-loop, the u <dig> and u <dig>  seen in most sequences were replaced by two guanines in the tmrna from the r. americana mitochondrion   <cit> . in the tmrna from caulobacter crescentus, the nucleotide corresponding to u <dig> in e. coli tmrna was changed to g <dig> in chainb .

helical sections 2b, 2c and 2d
overall, sections 2b, 2c, and 2d were well supported. sections 2a and 2b were separated by a variable loop ranging from one to seven nucleotides in the 5'portion and from one to nine nucleotides in the 3'portion. sections 2b and 2c had the potential to form a continuously stacked helix . usually, a bulge of two to six nucleotides separated helical sections 2c and 2d . an asymmetrical loop was present in some sequences . helix 2d was the most conserved of the three helical sections. the g43-u <dig> basepair  in helix 2d was only weakly supported, conserved in most phylogenetic groups, but altered in the thermatogales, cyanobacteria, alpha-proteobacteria, and gram-positive bacteria. a 46a-u <dig> pair was possible in the synechocystis species pcc <dig> tmrna.

pseudoknot  <dig> 
pseudoknot  <dig>  was well supported. of the three connecting regions, the two 5'-regions were very short  while the third was relatively long . all pseudoknots in tmrna followed the same general design  <cit> . most sequences contained helices  <dig> and  <dig>  with the exception of the tmrna from oenococcus oeni and the partial sequence from the chloroplast of pavlova lutheri, both of which lacked helix  <dig> and thus did not form a pseudoknot. helix  <dig> usually contained five basepairs. however, a sixth pair was possible in some bacteria.

helix  <dig> could be split into helicalsections 4a and 4b by a bulge seen in  <dig> sequences  or an internal loop seen in  <dig> tmrna sequences. the adenine-rich terminal loop between the downstream halves of helices  <dig> and  <dig> ranged in length from twoto <dig> nucleotides.

the mrna-like region 
the mld consisted of an open reading frame  preceding helix  <dig> and varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> nucleotides . the resume codon usually coded for alanine, but for glycine in  <dig> sequences , aspartic acid in three sequences , arginine in two uncultured species , serine in the uncultured species rca <dig>  and glutamic acid in mycoplasma pulmonis.

although helix  <dig> was only weakly supported by cbcs, recent site-directed mutagenesis experiments combined with functional studies in vivo and in vitro  <cit>  provide strong evidence for its existence. one to three stop codons were located within the helix  <dig> loop. a single uaa stop codon was present in  <dig> sequences. uag  or uga  were used less frequently. in  <dig> sequences there were two in-frame stop codons, where uaa was always the first codon, followed by another uaa , uag  or uga . curiously, two sequences  were found to contain three tandem in-frame stop codons.

pseudoknot  <dig> 
pseudoknot  <dig> was well supported and similar in overall design to pk <dig>  helical sections 6b and 6c showed a potential to form a continuous helix in thermotoga maritima. in beta-proteobacteria, 6b was replaced by a short hairpin6d  <cit> . helix 6d was observed also in three tmrnas of the gamma-proteobacteria acidithiobacillus ferroxidans and francisella tularensis.

pseudoknot  <dig> 
pseudoknot  <dig> was well supported but missing in cyanobacteria and the organelles . helical sections 8a and 8b were likely to be continuously stacked because a single helix was present in some species such as aquifex aeolicus. the unusual purine-rich internal loop between helical sections 8a and 8b was present in most gamma-proteobacteria suggesting a special function.

pseudoknot  <dig> 
this feature was well supported and was similar in design to the other tmrna pseudoknots. helical sections 10a and 10b had the potential to stack because a single helix was present in prevotella intermedia. in some cyanobacteria sequences, however, pk <dig> was replaced with two smaller tandem pseudoknots.

secondary structure prediction of the mld
because csa was unable to determine secondary structure for a large portion of the mld, energy calculations were carried out aimed to predict structure for the single-stranded portion of the open reading frame. the region corresponding to residues 79– <dig> of e. coli tmrna  was extracted from the alignment. a representative alignment of  <dig> sequences was submitted to mfold  <cit> . each sequence had the potential to form at least one helix, designated "m" . two or more adjacent helices were predicted for  <dig> sequences. the number of basepairs varied from two in chloroflexus aurantiacus to ten in mycoplasma pulmonis.

secondary structures of three representative tmrna molecules
secondary structures were determined for all sequences in the alignment but only three were extracted, diagrammed, and processed for 3-d modeling.

secondary structure of e. coli tmrna
the 363-nucleotide tmrna of the gamma-proteobacterium escherichia coli represented the typical tmrna containing the tld, the mld, and four pseudoknots  encompassing the pseudoknot domain . the 90-gca- <dig> resume triplet coded for alanine. two in-frame uaa stop codons  were located within the terminal loop of helix  <dig> . three basepaired regions  were only weakly supported by csa. helixm  was predicted only by energy calculations. a slightly different helix involving residues 88– <dig> has been suggested by footprinting of e. coli tmrna  <cit> . the evidence for the 112u-a <dig> basepair was weak, but was included due to the possibility of extending helix  <dig> . helical section 5a  was enlarged by the weakly supported 108g-c <dig>  110u-a <dig> and 111u-g <dig>  the 109c-g <dig> pair was disproved. in helix 10ab, the basepair between 256g-c <dig> was only weakly supported. helix 10ab  could be extended by the boxed 257u-g <dig> pair.

secondary structure of bacillus anthracis tmrna
overall, the secondary structure of bacillus anthracis tmrna  was similar to that of e. coli. one notabledifference was a bulged uridine  between helical sections 4a and 4b in pk <dig>  a three-basepair helixm was predicted. the resume triplet  coded for glycine, and the uaa stop codon was located at residues 119– <dig>  two weakly-supported pairs  extended helical section 5a.

secondary structure of caulobacter crescentus tmrna
caulobacter crescentus tmrna  consisted of two chains, a and b, of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, respectively. the resume codon  coded for alanine and was followed by a uaa stop codon at residues 121– <dig>  helical sectionsm <dig> and m <dig> were predicted by energy calculations. there was weak support for 5a , and the 106u-a <dig>  107u-a <dig>  108c-g <dig>  and 110c-g <dig> in chaina were disproved. the pseudoknots were relatively small. helix  <dig> corresponded to the absent pk <dig> .

tertiary structure modeling and visualization of tmrna
erna-3d, a program developed to model rna in three dimensions  <cit> , was used on an sgi workstation as described in materials and methods. e. coli tmrna was selected because this tmrna is the subject of extensive research. b. anthracis tmrna was chosen as an example of a tmrna from a gram-positive bacterium, and c. crescentus tmrna was selected it represents a two-part tmrna.

in order to create the initial models, the sequence and basepairing information were entered into an erna-3d input file to automatically generate a-form rna for the helices sections and specify the single-stranded regions using erna-3d's algorithm  <cit> . since erna-3d avoided an xyz coordinate system as reference for the user, the manipulation of the model from the viewer's perspective was simple and intuitive. the coordinates of each model were saved in pdb format  <cit>  for compatibility with other molecular modeling programs. motifs  were selected to model the loops and turns of a particular tmrna. erna-3d selection files were generated to define clusters and place the motif in 3-d without disturbance to the rest of the model. the 3-d cursor box was used to manipulate a cluster in three-dimensional space, similar to the manipulation of a section of a physical model.

numerous high-resolution structures determined by nmr or x-ray crystallography represented a rich source of detailed information for defining biologically meaningful motifs. the scor database  <cit>  provided a way to find suitabletemplates. in rare cases when a scor search for a motif did not result in an acceptable match , the nucleotides were positioned manually in erna-3d. otherwise, the coordinates were obtained from the protein data bank pdb  <cit> , extracted using the program swiss-pdbviewer  <cit> , and imported into erna-3d. the source motif and the region to be modeled were selected as separate clusters and aligned in three dimensions using common features . once superimposed, the coordinates of the residues in the source motif were copied onto the corresponding residues in the model. the template was then deleted, leaving a biologically meaningful structure. the backbone connections between the motif and the rest of the model were inspected visually and, if needed, manual adjustments were made to correct bond lengths and tetrahedral angles involving the phosphorous atom at the joint between the extracted motif and the helical structures generated by erna-3d.

as an example of the motif modeling process, the purine-rich loop in e. coli pk <dig>  was constructed using a similar loop in the 30s ribosomal subunit. first, the purine-rich loop was defined as motif 11a , and used to search the scor database. positions 780– <dig> and 800– <dig> in the structure of the thermus thermophilus 30s ribosomal subunit  <cit>  were found to conform to the motif. the 30s ribosomal subunit coordinates  were downloaded from the pdb and displayed using swiss-pdbviewer. the coordinates of the loop and the closing basepairs were extracted and inspected to confirm that the structure was compatible. the clustered regions were aligned with the ends of helical sections 8a and 8b at the basepairs 203u-g <dig> and 207a-u <dig> of the e. coli model and 779c-g <dig> and 783c-g <dig> of the template. template positions 780-aaa- <dig> and 800-gua- <dig> were then copied onto 204-gga- <dig> and 223-gaa- <dig> of the model. the template was deleted and the bond lengths and angles involving the atoms of the phosphates of residuesu <dig>  g <dig>  a <dig>  and u <dig> were adjusted.

in some instances, the tmrna sequence alignment was reinvestigated using ideas derived from the 3-d model. for example, the alignments of pk <dig> in bacillus anthracis tmrna and relatives was changed from a two nucleotide bulge  between helical sections 4a and 4b to a more feasible and equally well supported one-nucleotide bulge . the alignment of helix  <dig> in pk <dig> in b. anthracis tmrna and relatives was altered from a 237c-a <dig> mismatch and an asymmetrical loop  to a single looped-out c <dig>  the alignment of pk <dig> of caulobacter crescentus and relatives was changed from four basepairs and a weakly supported fifth pair in helix  <dig>  to the four basepair structure seen in additional file 6: ccrescentus2d.pdf. information about spatial neighborhoods as obtained from cross-linking, site-directed mutagenesis, and functional testing of e. coli tmrna was introduced and is described in detail below. all models were inspected visually for correct bond angles and distances around the phosphorous atoms at the joints between the extracted motifs and the helical regions generated by erna-3d. the coordinates are provided as additional file 7: ecoli-closed.pdb, 8: ecoli-open.pdb, 9: banthracis-closed.pdb, and 10: ccrescentus-closed.pdb.

3-d model of e. coli tmrna
the model shown as a ribbon diagram in figure  <dig> consists of a compacted mld and pkd with the tld extending from the body of the molecule due to the near-coaxial stacking of the helix  <dig> sections. the coordinates for the tld were taken from a previous model  <cit>  which is based on two cross-linked sites, one formed between nucleotides u9/u <dig> near the 5' end and nucleotides c346/u <dig> in the t loop, the other involving residues at positions 25– <dig> and 326– <dig> within helix 2a . important features of the tld include the non-watson-crick base pairs formed by 19-ga- <dig> and 333-ga- <dig> which have been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis  <cit> .

a very efficient uv-induced cross-link observed between the stop codon loop of helix  <dig> and pk <dig> of e. coli tmrna  introduced a considerable constraint of helices  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and, as has been shown recently, is consistent with the cryo-em structure of ribosome-bound tmrna of the initial stage of trans-translation  <cit> . also considered was the previously-discovered covariation  <cit>  between c <dig> and c <dig>  which determines the orientation of helix  <dig> in relation to helix  <dig> and thus the approximate angle by which the tld protrudes. the 44/ <dig> covariation is strongly supported  in an alignment of  <dig> representative sequences . since this is a non-watson-crick covariation, it is difficult to propose a precise structure in this region. more extensive studies will be required to better understand the nature of the 44/ <dig> covariation.

overall, the distance between the 3'end and a <dig> in pk <dig> was  <dig> Å, and  <dig> Å between the outside edges of pk <dig> and pk <dig>  helix  <dig> and pk <dig> were positioned in a parallel fashion. the nucleotides in the bulge between helical sections 6a and 6b  were adjusted manually to allow for a close fit of helix  <dig> and pk <dig>  this model is supported by the finding that mutations that destroy base pairing in helix  <dig> substantially decrease tmrna tagging activity  and abolish the long-distance interaction between helix  <dig> and pk <dig> as judged by the absence of a cross-link between the stop codon loop of helix  <dig> and pk <dig> . evidence for the existence of helix  <dig> has been provided by the analysis of compensatory mutations which completely restore tagging  <cit> . each of the four pseudoknots displayed the previously determined structural properties characterized by extensive helical stacking  <cit> . the mld and pseudoknots were arranged in a central loop with the resume codon positioned near the junction between helices 2a and 2b . our model reflects the finding that the pseudoknots are functionally interchangeable  <cit>  and thus are likely to retain a considerable level of structural independence. furthermore, data derived from cross-linking experiments showing that pk <dig> and pk <dig> are in close proximity whereas helix  <dig> and pk <dig> are further apart  agree with the presented model.

3-d model of b. anthracis tmrna
the 3-d model of the b. anthracis tmrna  was similar to the e. coli model. a sharper angle was modeled between helix  <dig> axis and the pkd. the dimensions were  <dig> Å from the 3'end to the distant edge of pk <dig>  and approximately  <dig> Å between the outer edges of pk <dig> and pk <dig>  respectively.

3-d model of c. crescentus two-part tmrna
compared to the other two tmrna models, the two-part tmrna caulobacter crescentus model  was slightly more elongated. it measured  <dig> Å from the 3'-end of chainb to the single-stranded region between pk <dig> and pk <dig>  the distance between helix  <dig> and the 3'end of chaina was  <dig> Å.

discussion
we have compared a growing number of tmrna sequences from all groups of bacteria to produce an alignment from which the secondary structure of any tmrna could be easily extracted. most basepairs were supported by phylogenetic evidence, whereas only a few helical sections required energy calculations. uncertainties in assignment of basepairs, such as the pseudoknot region of chloroplasts and one-piece cyanobacterial tmrnas, may be eliminated in the future when more sequences will become available.

the common layout of the secondary structures indicated a similar function in all bacteria. the number and size of the pseudoknots varied, supporting the idea that the pseudoknots may only enhance the essential functions carried by the tld and the mld  <cit> . differences in the secondary structure features were usually not random but occurred between groups of related organisms. for example, helix 6d was present only in the beta- and three close relatives of the gamma-proteobacteria. whether these group-specific features are responsible for differences in the trans-translation mechanism remains to be determined. however, strategies that exploit these differences, for example for developing new antibiotics targeted at a specific group of bacteria, can now be envisioned.

in principle, tertiary structure models of any tmrna in the alignment could be built using the described procedures. here, we have shown how to generate a biologically more meaningful model of e. coli tmrna which represents a significant progress from a previous model  <cit> . we also constructed 3-d model of the tmrnas of b. anthracis and c. crescentus. overall, the three models were similar in shape and size confirming that all tmrnas have the potential to function similarly in trans-translation. the tld mimicked the l-shape of canonical trna  <cit>  and may be necessary for proper association tmrna with the ef-tu, smpb, and subsequent binding to the ribosomal a-site. the lack of a d-stem has been suggested to confer flexibility  <cit> , but smpb may be responsible for stabilizing this region  <cit> .

differences in the shapes of the three tmrna models  may be due to the difficulty in determining the precise arrangement of the pseudoknots. considering that the pseudoknots are likely to constitute relatively independent structural units, conformational changes might occur around the connecting single strands, as well as in the mld and the weakly-supported helix m. tmrna may become less flexible when bound to proteins such as smpb and ribosomal protein s <dig>  ef-tu, however, likely binds to the coaxially-stacked helices  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , and therefore appears to have little effect on the conformation of the tld. protein smpb was found to bind near helix 2a  <cit> , has two rna binding sites  <cit> , and thus could make additional contacts with other regions. protein s <dig> is the largest ribosomal protein, has been shown to be close to numerous sites, and to be required for the binding of tmrna to the ribosome  <cit> . since s <dig> is a flexible, beadlike protein  <cit>  it may not restrict the conformational potential of the tmrna molecule. instead, the protein may instill some constraint to the large central loop formed by the pkd and the mld. because s <dig> is known to melt helices in mrnas  <cit> , it is also possible that it unwinds helix m and exposes the resume codon and the preceding nucleotides u <dig> and a <dig> for efficient trans-translation  <cit> .

the tmrna models show the resume codon in close proximity to the internal loop formed between helical sections 2a and 2b. this arrangement would allow the ribosome to "jump" a relatively short distance from the end of the broken mrna onto the orf of tmrna. in a recent cryo-em study of the initial stage of trans-translation  <cit> , the trna-like region, smpb, ef-tu, and part of pk <dig> were located in the a-site of the ribosome. we suggest that this more open arrangement is made possible due to the flexibility of tmrna, the melting of helix m, and/or a change in conformation induced by the binding of tmrna to the ribosome . the opening of the central loop seems to be accompanied by a rotation of the tld around the helix  <dig> axis  and thus might properly align the resume codon with the 3'-end of broken mrna in the ribosomal decoding centre. at the later stages of the transit of tmrna across the ribosome even more dramatic conformational changes were shown to disrupt helix  <dig> and the pseudoknotted regions . these downstream alterations are likely mediated not by protein s <dig> but by the intrinsic helicase activity of the ribosome  <cit>  and are required to maintain the ribosomal subunits in close proximity to the unfolded tmrna in order to monitor trans-translation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study significantly advances our understanding of trans-translation by providing biologically feasible 3-d models for the entire tmrna molecule. although the modeling of only three tmrnas has been described here, 3-d models of every tmrna can be extracted from the alignment. the models are characterized by a functionally significant features, including biologically relevant structures for the single-stranded regions and the close proximity between the tld and the resume codon. conformational changes induced by binding of tmrna to smpb, ribosomal protein s <dig>  and the ribosome suggest a transformation of a free compact tmrna to a more open ribosome-bound structure. the comparative modeling approach described here for tmrna is easily adapted for other rna classes.
