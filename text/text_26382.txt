BACKGROUND
climate change is expected to modify several environmental factors, including temperature, co <dig> concentration, radiation level, water availability, wind speed and air moisture, and to noticeably affect crop production  <cit> . air and land temperatures on earth’s surface are predicted to increase from  <dig>  to  <dig>  °c by the end of the 21th century  <cit> , in addition to the past temperature rises. temperature and rainfall are major climatic factors influencing grapevine phenology, yield, berry composition and wine quality  <cit> . heat stress is more difficult to cope with than drought stress, which can be mitigated through irrigation or rootstock selection  <cit> . according to hannah et al.  <cit> , most of vine growing regions will undergo a global warming of 2 °c to 4 °c in the next decades. mild to moderate temperature increases  were shown to advance grapevine vegetative development and the whole fruit ripening period up to five weeks earlier, i.e. at the time of maximum summer temperatures  <cit> . phenological changes may negatively impact berry development program and composition. indeed, warmer climate in the past resulted in higher sugar level and lower contents of organic acids, phenolics and aroma . such alterations of berry composition directly impair the organoleptic quality and the stability of wines  <cit> . moreover, high temperature promotes disease development  <cit> , reduces carbohydrate reserves in perennial organs  <cit> , decreases bud fertility, inhibits berry set and, as a result, lowers final yield .

negative impacts of climate change on viticulture sustainability and wine quality may be mitigated by: i) viticultural practices such as irrigation or canopy management  <cit> , ii) wine processing like acidification or electro-dialysis, iii) shifting of the vine growing areas towards higher altitude or latitude regions  <cit>  and iv) breeding new cultivars better adapted to the climate changes  <cit> . the first two methods are widely used, although they are only short-term solutions with limited efficiency. the shift of grape growing areas to cooler climate regions would have dramatic socio-economic consequences. thus, the development of new cultivars appears to be the best long-term solution for a sustainable viticulture maintaining premium wine production under global warming. however, it requires improving the knowledge on the genetics of key grapevine functions under various environments.

quantitative trait loci  repeated over years have been identified in grapevine in usual climate and cultivation conditions. they are notably qtls for berry size and seedlessness  <cit> , yield components  <cit> , phenology  <cit> , muscat flavour  <cit> , anthocyanin composition  <cit> , tannin composition  <cit> , fruitfulness  <cit> , cluster architecture  <cit>  and disease resistance . however, no attempts have been made to test their stability regarding large temperature variations. molecular physiology and genetic studies have increased our knowledge on the regulation of grapevine reproductive development, including flowering  <cit> , berry growth  <cit> , organic acid pathways  <cit> , tannin  <cit>  or anthocyanin accumulation  <cit>  and sugar uploading  <cit> . the physiological and molecular adaptation of the grapevine to heat stress was recently addressed. although a slight temperature increase accelerates berry development, high temperatures and/or heat stress  were shown to produce opposite effect, thus delaying berry ripening  <cit> . luchaire et al.  <cit>  and rienth et al.  <cit>  showed that the carbon flow toward the internodes was dramatically impaired under heat stress, leading to increasing the flowering to ripening time-lag, and to noticeable reprogramming of berry transcriptome.

the genetic control of grapevine adaptation to abiotic stresses remains poorly understood because it requires experimentations on large populations under multi-environment conditions. a few qtls for water use efficiency and transpiration under duly controlled water stress have been found  <cit> . regarding the adaptation to temperature stress, no qtl has yet been identified in grapevine. however, the identification of genetic determinants is critical for the development of temperature-tolerant grapevine cultivars. furthermore, as for other perennial crops, grapevine breeding is a slow and challenging process in order to combine desirable fruit quality and disease tolerance traits  <cit> . in grapevine, the breeding process can be noticeably accelerated combining marker-assisted selection  <cit>  and short cycling material such as the microvine  <cit> .

the aim of this work was to identify stable qtls for a large set of vegetative and reproductive traits in grapevine under contrasted temperature conditions. a pseudo-f <dig> mapping population of  <dig> microvine offsprings, derived from a cross between the picovine  <cit>  and the ugni blanc flb mutant  <cit>  was genotyped using a 18 k single nucleotide polymorphism  illumina® chip and phenotyped for  <dig> traits over up to nine cropping cycles. fourteen qtls for berry development and composition or leaf area were found repeated over at least two conditions, among which  <dig> were stable over at least half of the environments explored.

for each environment, all  <dig> traits were classified according to the ward hierarchical classification in order to assess correlations between them . berry weight at green and maturity stages  remained highly correlated regardless of the environment and this also was found true for the correlation between leaf area  and internode length  . moreover, tartrate concentration and tartrate/total acid ratio at green lag phase  were correlated to each other and also linked with the number of berries and clusters . however tag was not related to malate concentration , which correlated with sugar concentration traits at green lag phase .fig.  <dig> biplots of vegetative or berry composition related traits in a microvine population. a. leaf area vs internode length. b. total sugars vs malate concentration at green lag phase



seventeen of the  <dig> phenotyped traits showed correlations  between at least two environments , but only the number of seeds showed such correlations between all environments.

most of the models selected to estimate heritability included the environment effect . broad sense heritability  of the inter-environment genotypic means varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and it was higher than  <dig>  for  <dig> traits out of  <dig>  the number of seeds per berry and berry weight at green lag phase and maturity displayed the highest heritabilities .

genetic maps
out of the 18 k snps on the chip,  <dig>  were polymorphic in this population and yielded good quality genotyping data. a subset of these snps was selected to build a framework map for each parent suitable for initial qtl detection, with a marker density appropriate for this population size.

the paternal genetic map  consisted of  <dig> snp markers  mapped on  <dig> linkage groups and covering a total of  <dig>  cm. coverage was mostly satisfying with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers and 302 kb/cm. however, some lg parts were not covered, mainly due to the discarding of monomorphic markers . it was not due to the absence of markers on the 18 k chip in these regions, since there was no distance between adjacent markers larger than  <dig>  mb on this chip . in a few map gaps however, only non-vinifera markers had been defined on the chip, which may not have amplified on this v. vinifera population. in two specific regions of lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  harboring the sex and flb loci, respectively  <cit> , there was simply no male segregation in the population, since the picovine was homozygous and ugni blanc flb heterozygous at both these loci and only hermaphrodite offspring with no fleshless berries were retained for this study. all markers from paternal lg  <dig>  on each side of the selected region, exhibited high segregation distortion.

the maternal genetic map  consisted of  <dig> snp markers  mapped on  <dig> linkage groups spanning a total of 606 cm, with an average inter-marker distance of  <dig>  cm and 390 kb/cm. compared to the paternal map, the number of markers and genome coverage in the maternal map were halved, resulting in a smaller map with markers not covering the entire genome. picovine comes from a self-fertilization of a microvine  <cit> . thus, it is highly homozygous . lg  <dig> was even totally missing in the maternal map. nevertheless, a good colinearity was found between the order of genetic markers and their physical localisation on the genome, in both maps .

qtl detection
a hundred and fourteen significant qtls were identified on parental maps . among them,  <dig> were detected under two environments or more. in this study, a focus was placed on these repeated qtls only . these qtls concerned  <dig> out of the  <dig> phenotyped traits and were related to leaf area and berry trait variations. ten of these qtls were considered as stable since they were detected in at least half of the conditions explored. no repeated qtlxqtl interaction was found.table  <dig> statistically significant repeated qtls, identified under at least two different growing conditions

leaf area
two repeated qtls explaining up to 12 % and 17 % of leaf area variation were found on picovine lg  <dig> and on ugni blanc flb lg  <dig>  respectively. the lg  <dig> qtl was stable over half of the conditions. no repeated qtl was detected for other vegetative traits  that varied within environments.

seed number, berry weight, number of berries and clusters
a new major qtl for the number of seeds per berry  was found on ugni blanc flb lg  <dig> in all studied environments, where it explained 48 % to 76 % of the total variance . this major qtl co-localized with the qtls for berry weight at green lag phase  and at maturity , which explained 25-44 % and 17-42 % of total variance, respectively, in the different conditions investigated. stable qtls for the number of clusters  and the number of berries per cluster  were also localized in the same region, explaining 13-25 % and 18-24 % of total variation, respectively. another repeated qtl for the number of berries per cluster , explaining 13–18 % of total variance, was detected twice on lg  <dig> in ugni blanc flb.

berry organic acid contents
major and minor qtls for malate and tartrate contents at green lag phase were identified in ugni blanc flb and picovine. five stable qtls were discovered, for malate/total acid , malate/tartrate , and tartrate/total acid  ratios and for berry tartrate concentration  in ugni blanc flb, explaining from 12 % to 35 % of total variation. four of them co-localized with the seed number and berry weight qtls on lg  <dig>  another tag qtl was identified on lg  <dig> in ugni blanc flb, but contrary to the lg  <dig> tag qtl, it did not co-localize with qtls for the dimensionless traits mtg, mog or tog. only one minor repeated qtl for a berry acidity trait was detected twice in picovine, at the top of lg  <dig>  explaining 6 % to 12 % of the total berry acid concentration  variance at green lag phase.

candidate genes
the size of integrated qtl confidence intervals  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  and harbored from  <dig> to  <dig> genes per qtl. as a first approach, we screened these candidate genes taking into account their functional annotations  and expression patterns , which reduced by four to  <dig> times the number of most probable candidate genes per qtl . the distribution of these selected candidate genes according to each main biological function is shown in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> integrated confidence interval limits for repeated qtls and number of total and most probable positional candidate genes

discussion
this qtl study, merging extensive phenotyping data  with a high-density genetic map obtained with the 18 k snp chip, led to identify  <dig> new stable qtls. some traits regarding berry acidity were mapped in vitis vinifera for the first time and new genome regions were identified for these and other traits. qtl stability assessment was expanded towards an unprecedented temperature variation range  thanks to the possibility to grow the microvine progeny in tightly controlled conditions, which is almost impossible with standard non-dwarf vines.

segregation extent and heritability of phenotyped traits in the population
the dwarf mapping population showed berry weight and composition variations consistent with those generally reported for grapevine. indeed, berry weight of extreme individuals ranged from  <dig>  g to  <dig>  g at green lag phase, and from  <dig>  g to  <dig>  g at maturity stage. similar variations were reported by houel et al.  <cit>  on a set of 165 v. vinifera wine varieties, including the ones used to generate the progeny: cv. ugni blanc and pinot meunier. similar variation extent was also reported by doligez et al.  <cit>  in a segregating population from a cross between two other cultivars, syrah and grenache. in accordance with previous results on v. vinifera  <cit> , the average total acid and potassium concentrations in fruits within the population were  <dig> and 53 meq/kg.fw, respectively, at green lag phase. they decreased to respectively  <dig> and 87 meq/kg.fw at berry maturity. the variation magnitude for total acid and potassium concentrations in ripe fruit observed between extreme individuals  was the same as in another v. vinifera progeny .

these results indicate that, for reproductive traits, the picovine 00c001v <dig> x ugni blanc flb  progeny behaved like other v. vinifera progenies. interestingly, a correlation between glucose plus fructose and malate concentrations emerged at the green lag phase , namely before the onset of ripening, which was not documented before. increased total sugar concentration is not an artifact due to the casual presence of ripe berries in green lag phase samples, since this would have resulted in a decrease in malate, conversely to what was actually observed. the level of sugars at the end of the first berry growth phase remains quite low and this illustrates that organic acids are by far the major osmoticum as compared to sugars, the opposite being true during the ripening phase . moreover, our results also suggest that malate, as a lower cost osmoticum, becomes even more favoured upon the impairment of the carbon balance, in different genotype x environment conditions.

in our study, some traits displayed lower broad-sense heritability than in previous studies, particularly acid or sugar-related traits at maturity. in previous studies, broad-sense heritability was most often above  <dig> . at maturity, it was  <dig> - <dig>  for total sugar content  <cit> ,  <dig> - <dig>  for malic acid and  <dig> - <dig>  for tartaric acid contents  <cit> ,  <dig> - <dig>  for total acids content  <cit> ,  <dig> - <dig>  for berry weight ,  <dig>  for seed number  <cit> ,  <dig>  for number of berries per cluster  <cit> ,  <dig> - <dig>  for number of clusters  <cit> . broad-sense heritability was  <dig>  for berry weight at véraison  <cit>  and  <dig> - <dig>  for leaf area  <cit> . the temperature range explored in our study was very large thanks to the use of growth rooms , and environmental variation may be inflated in our study compared to previous ones, especially to those reporting within-year heritabilities. this may partly explain the discrepancy between our estimates and the previous ones. another possible explanation arises from the various ways maturity stage is assessed among studies . this may have biased genetic variance estimates in some studies. last but not least, genetic variation and thus heritability strongly depends on the qtls segregating in each cross, as suggested by the large range of estimates among studies for a given trait. in particular, genetic variation is expected to be larger in interspecific crosses than in pure v. vinifera ones.

new qtls for berry yield components
in addition to the number of clusters per axis, berry weight and number per cluster are key determinants of grapevine yield. qtls for the number of seeds per berry  and berry weight  in one or more years were already reported on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  respectively . but this is the first time that major qtls for ns, bwg and bwm are detected on lg  <dig> in grapevine. the parents of the present cross were related to wine cultivars from northern and western france , whereas the parents in previous v. vinifera qtl studies for these traits were wine cultivars from southern france and spain  or related to table cultivars  from italy, spain, eastern europe, etc. therefore, since different selection histories have certainly produced various heterozygosity status among these parents, it is not surprising to find novel qtls in the present study.

moreover, qtls for ns, bwg and bwm co-localized on lg  <dig> and showed decreasing variance, suggesting that a major locus might affect seed and berry cell numbers simultaneously during early development, or alternatively that expansion might indirectly be controlled by seeds through growth regulators control, later on in the development  <cit> . this result is consistent with the co-localization of seed trait qtls with the major berry weight qtl on lg  <dig> in the seedless context , but contrasts with the lack of co-localization of any other seed trait qtls with berry weight qtls in any cross reported to date in grapevine. the consequences for use in breeding will therefore differ for this particular locus. the high correlation between bwg and bwm in this population is consistent with our previous finding on a sample of  <dig> varieties of vitis vinifera. indeed, the main determinants of the genetic variation for berry size were shown to be active before the green lag phase of berry growth  <cit> .

stable qtls were also identified on lg  <dig> for the number of berries per cluster and the number of clusters per phytomer  and a repeated one was found on lg  <dig> for nb. only the nb qtl on lg  <dig> co-localized with a similar one identified by fanizza et al.  <cit>  in one year only.

grape berry acidity qtls
grape berry acidity is known to be severely impacted by temperature during the growing season and should become a target of prime importance for breeding . we showed here that malic acid may be strongly impacted by temperature during the green growth stage, and that the malate/tartrate ratio may strongly vary, depending on environmental conditions, while the total acid concentration is more stable . here, several stable qtls regarding berry organic acid contents at green lag phase were identified for the first time in a pure intra-specific v. vinifera cross. chen et al.  <cit>  recently reported two-year repeated qtls for malate and tartrate/malate ratio on lg  <dig> in a complex interspecific cross between several vitis species. two major tartrate concentration  qtls were detected on ugni blanc flb lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  explaining each from 12 % to 35 % of total variance. they are the first stable significant tartrate qtls reported in grapevine. a single-year phenotyping study previously led to the identification of putative only qtls for berry ph and tartaric acid concentration in an interspecific cross  <cit> . according to our results, it will be possible to modify tartrate concentration in berries by breeding within v. vinifera, without resorting to interspecific crosses. this is a highly valuable result, since interspecific introgression schemes are more complex and introduce some undesired characteristics in wine taste, which are not widely accepted, interspecific hybrids even being often merely forbidden.

tartrate synthesis occurs quite rapidly following fecundation. then, its concentration decreases, due to dilution, while malate and sugars become the major osmoticum in green and ripe berries, respectively. such a mechanism makes tag dependent not only on tartrate synthesis, but also on berry expansion and malate synthesis. dimensionless calculated traits such as the malate/tartrate ratio or the tartrate or malate relative contribution ratios  confirmed the lg  <dig> acidity qtl in all environmental conditions investigated. puzzlingly, this was not the case for the lg  <dig> qtl, suggesting that these qtls could act through the genetic control of intrinsically different events. in this respect, the co-localization of seed number, berry weight, and malate/tartrate qtls on lg  <dig> may not be circumstantial. its most parsimonious interpretation is that a single gene expressed during early berry development would affect seed number, which in turn would drive malate synthesis and cellular expansion, which is linked to increased malate/tartrate ratio  <cit> . further experiments addressing cell number and the kinetics of malate and tartrate accumulation on extreme phenotypes are needed to confirm these hypotheses.

qtls for leaf area and other traits
in this study, two qtls have been identified for leaf area  on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  two previous studies reported qtls for leaf morphology and area in grapevine  <cit>  that did not co-localize with our repeated la qtls. however, one la qtl identified only once  co-localized with one qtl mentioned by coupel-ledru et al.  <cit>  on lg  <dig>  these discrepancies between studies highlight the polygenic determinism of berry weight, seed number and leaf area, with different genes or alleles segregating in different populations.

in this study, qtls for phy, il, pif, pfv, mag, cig, cog, cim, mom, tom, com, mtm, tosg, kg, askg, gfm, tosm and km traits were found in one growing condition only , suggesting frequent occurrence of genotype x environment interactions. for some other traits , no significant qtl was detected. for some of these traits, especially those with a low heritability, the parents of the cross might simply not be heterozygous for the main underlying genes. for the other traits, the reason might be the limited power for detecting small qtls which results from the limited population size. moreover, the berry weight qtl was detected in fewer environments at fruit maturity than at green lag phase. furthermore, the qtl of berry tartrate content identified at green lag phase disappeared at maturity. this may reflect increased berry sampling errors due to the increase of berry heterogeneity during ripening or to inaccurate assessment of ripe stage, in the absence of precise kinetic measurements.

co-localization of qtls and correlations
nine berry or organic acid-related qtls co-segregated on lg  <dig>  some of these traits were highly correlated, based on the ward hierarchical classification. the negative correlation between number of berries  and number of clusters  likely results from plant physiological limitation, possibly insufficient carbon supply, to allow for fruit development and ripening. qtls for nb and nc had small effects but also small heritability. qtls for berry weight had large effects compared to their h <dig>  therefore, their co-localization on lg  <dig> alone could explain their observed correlation. final berry weight is determined early during berry development and organic acids constitute the major osmoticum for vacuolar enlargement during the green growth stage, supporting a nine-fold increase of the berry cell volume between anthesis and the onset of ripening  <cit> .

finally, the lack of phenotypic correlation between traits showing qtls co-localized on lg  <dig> might be explained by other qtls, not detected in this study and not co-localized, but also by a lack of environmental correlation. although leaf area  and internode length  were positively correlated  and heritability was slightly higher for il than for la, repeated qtls were found only for la and not for il, suggesting that this newly reported correlation was mainly of environmental rather than of genetic origin.

qtls stable under different environments
in grapevine, two studies on the genetic determinism of adaptation to water stress allowed the identification of qtls involved in the acclimation of scion transpiration induced by rootstock  <cit>  and in the regulation of leaf water potential under soil drought partly due to reduced leaf transpiration  <cit> . selection of allelic variation at these qtls appears to be a promising way to select new cultivars to face climate change.

in our study, although the population showed a response of both vegetative and reproductive traits to thermal chart variations , no repeated qtl could be evidenced for trait difference between the two temperature conditions . since response to temperature exhibited a large variability for each trait, the absence of qtls for this response seemed to be rather due to low heritability . nevertheless,  <dig> qtls stable under different environments mainly differing in terms of temperature have been found. by design, in all environments, the progeny was grown in 3 l pots with the same substrate and non-limiting irrigation. moreover, in using growth rooms, our objective was to obtain differences only in temperature, since photoperiod, air vapour pressure and radiation level were regulated. these qtls thus represent another very interesting genetic potential for the delivery of new cultivars with stable yield and quality under warmer climate conditions.

candidate genes
the integrated confidence intervals around repeated qtls  were large, harbouring several hundred genes. such interval sizes make the identification of candidate genes particularly tricky, insofar as gene annotation remains perfectible in grapevine. low acidity phenotypes were recently attributed to mutations in an aluminium activated malate transporter in apple, and in an uncharacterized transporter in cucurbits , but no genes co-localizing with acidity qtls in vitis exhibited significant homologies with them . moreover, organ specific traits may be indirectly controlled by genes expressed elsewhere in the plant. keeping these reserves in mind, as a first approach, we have screened candidates using the last annotation releases from both cribi and ncbi and selected a set of genes showing positive expression patterns in targeted organs, thus lowering down the candidate gene number to  <dig> to  <dig> per qtl. none of these genes had been previously identified in qtls for fruit size  or fruit acidity  <cit>  in fleshy fruit crops. one of the positional candidate genes from the short list obtained is a putative cytoplasmic malic dehydrogenase . this enzyme is involved in the conversion of malate into oxaloacetate together with other isoforms in mitochondria and plastids .

in any case, this study put forward a first list of candidate genes which should be confronted with data from association genetics or transcriptomic studies for validation. considering the number of somatic variants available for grapevine  <cit> , mutants affected for these traits, such as the fleshless berry mutant or the reiteration of reproductive meristems mutant  <cit>  may also be used for this purpose.

the microvine: a valuable tool for qtl mapping
the microvine or dwarf and rapid cycling and flowering  mutant was recently proposed as a new model system for rapid forward and reverse genetics  <cit> . it is relevant for genetic studies on grapevine as it can be used as an annual crop, while presenting all characteristics of a perennial crop. it offers several advantages when compared to a non dwarf genotype:  a compact size, allowing the study of entire microvine populations under controlled environment,  an early flowering that occurs in the same year as sowing, instead of 4– <dig> years with the non drcf genotypes, and  a continuous production of reproductive organs with sequential ripening allowing the study of all the development stages at the same time or at several times during the year. such a sequential ripening along the shoot is known to occur in non-drcf vines as well  <cit> . these characteristics are ideal to prospect the genetic and ecophysiological bases of grapevine adaptation to abiotic stresses, since microvine berry development exhibits the same pattern as regular vine  <cit> . using microvine progenies and high throughput microarrays screening, fernandez et al.  <cit>  were able to map the fleshless berry locus and to identify a mutation in vvpi as the origin of the fleshless berry phenotype. moreover, dunlevy et al.  <cit>  used a f <dig> progeny of a cross between a drcf mutant, which does not produce 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine , and the v. vinifera cabernet sauvignon cv., to identify the major locus responsible for accumulation of ibmp in grapes.

microvine was used in the present study to decipher the genetic control of quantitative traits related to plant vegetative and reproductive development. the microvine population, obtained from a cross between a picovine x ugni blanc flb, allowed the phenotyping of up to  <dig> traits under nine environmental conditions. however, to obtain a large microvine mapping population, the use of the picovine as a female parent was required, because it is homozygous for the dwarf mutation  and female loci  <cit> . the high homozygosity of the picovine 00c001v <dig> genome, resulted in only half a maternal genetic map, with an entire linkage group missing . thus, the identification of qtls for this parent was not exhaustive.

the grapevine 18 k snp chip
the 18 k snp chip allowed building both high-quality and high-density genetic maps. indeed, the overall genotyping error rate was ≤  <dig>  for each map, and only  <dig> out of the  <dig>  snps present on the chip were discarded due to segregation distortion issues. in addition, reproducibility of control genotypes used for the chip creation was 100 %, when the dna analysed was of good quality . this was the case for all the samples in the present study. such a very low error rate is an advantage of this high-throughput technique when compared to bar-coded multiplex sequencing  <cit>  or genotyping by sequencing  <cit> , which produce huge amounts of data but with a high rate of genotyping error.

the two high-density parental genetic maps contained  <dig> and  <dig> snp markers with an average distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm for picovine and ugni blanc flb, respectively. the marker coverage of these genetic maps is higher than in most recent studies using aflp, ssr and/or snp markers in grapevine. the latest studies reported an average interval between adjacent markers from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for genetic maps with less than  <dig> markers per map . the map of vezzulli et al.  <cit>  was based on  <dig>  markers with an average spacing of  <dig>  cm, but it resulted from the integration of maps from three different populations. recently, wang et al.  <cit>  and barba et al.  <cit> , using next generation sequencing, reported parental maps of 759– <dig>  snp markers with inter-marker distances of  <dig> - <dig>  cm and a consensus map of  <dig>  snp markers distant of  <dig>  cm on average, respectively. recently, chen et al.  <cit>  also reported two parental maps with intervals ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm, by genotyping an interspecific vitis hybrid with next-generation restriction site-associated dna sequencing.

here, the high average map density achieved was fully satisfying since maps were saturated with many co-segregating snp markers, despite the low proportion of informative markers  in the mapping population. in previous studies using high-throughput illumina® snp chip genotyping for qtl or association genetics in rice, alfalfa, maize and wheat , the proportion of polymorphic markers was larger, ranging from 52 % to 81 %. the 18 k grapevine snp chip was composed of  <dig>  snps  from  <dig> vitis vinifera and  <dig>  snps  from  <dig> other vitis species and muscadinia rotundifolia  <cit>  while 96 % of the  <dig>  snps polymorphic in the mapping population were from v. vinifera. this discrepancy partly explained the low proportion of snps that could be used for mapping in this population. within the vitis genus, species are clearly differentiated  <cit>  and snp transferability to v. vinifera is low  <cit> . in spite of the technical constraints for the design of specific probes  <cit> , there were only two regions not covered with v. vinifera snp markers on the chip, corresponding to the bottom of chromosome  <dig>  and to an inferior part of chromosome  <dig>  . the technical constraints, together with the low polymorphism levels of non-vinifera snp markers in this population could explain the few gaps observed in parental maps, their occurrence being further increased for picovine due to its high homozygosity.

CONCLUSIONS
applying an abiotic stress on a whole population for genetic studies is particularly difficult for a perennial crop such as grapevine. thanks to the reduced size of the microvine and its biological characteristics, we were able to grow a progeny of microvines under several environmental conditions, mainly differing in temperature. in this study, we identify some new qtls for important developmental vegetative and reproductive traits that have limited interactions with environmental factors such as temperature. therefore, these qtls are a valuable first step towards finding useful genetic variation for maintaining vine yield and fruit quality under elevated temperatures.
