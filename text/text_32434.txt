BACKGROUND
enterococci are gram-positive facultative anaerobic cocci with a low gc-content. they are natural inhabitants of the mammalian gastrointestinal  tract and among the first lactic acid bacteria to colonize the intestines of a newborn  <cit> . during the last three decades, enterococci have emerged as important pathogens and as a major cause of nosocomial infections. the majority of hospital-acquired, enterococcal infections is caused by enterococcus faecalis  <cit> . several putative virulence factors have been characterized in e. faecalis , and their roles in pathogenicity have been established in various animal models  <cit>  and cultured cell lines  <cit> . a large number of reports on enterococcal pathogenicity has focused on the presence or absence of these virulence determinants in enterococcal isolates from different origins  <cit> . the results have shown that several of the putative virulence traits are detected in enterococcal isolates independent of their origin, suggesting that these factors may not be crucial for enterococcal pathogenicity. however, a higher incidence of some of the virulence determinants in clinical isolates may indicate that these genes enhance the ability of e. faecalis to cause disease, as suggested by virulence studies on bacterial mutants in animal models  <cit> .

the sequencing of the e. faecalis v <dig> genome   <cit>  made global analyses of whole genome diversity within this species possible  <cit> , by the use of microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization . the approximate size and composition of the e. faecalis core genome have been investigated on clinical, food and environmental isolates  <cit> . the cgh-approach has also been used to evaluate the dissemination of variable traits from the v <dig> genome within diverse lineages of the species  <cit> . previous analyses have shown that the main genomic variation between the strains correspond to previously identified mobile genetic elements  in v <dig>  <cit> . however, an effort to explore the gene content of commensal e. faecalis by cgh has not previously been made and little is known about genetic determinants that may explain the differences in life style between pathogenic and non-pathogenic e. faecalis strains.

the aim of this study was to investigate the genomic diversity among fecal e. faecalis isolated from healthy norwegian infants by means of cgh. in an attempt to study genetic variability of commensal e. faecalis isolates, we used genome-wide dna arrays to probe the presence of  <dig> open reading frames  from v <dig> and  <dig> orfs representing a 17-kb deletion in the v <dig> pathogenicity island in our collection of community-derived norwegian fecal e. faecalis baby isolates. the isolates were also characterized with respect to antibiotic resistance and properties associated with virulence, by pcr and phenotypic assays.

methods
stool samples
this study included  <dig> healthy norwegian infants  born in the eastern part of norway. the babies were all born in oslo and akershus counties. informed consent had been obtained from their parents. from infants a-c, stool samples were collected once each month during the first six months and once after  <dig> months from october  <dig> to september  <dig>  while from infants d-k, samples were collected once during the first six months of life during  <dig>  all the samples were collected after mother and child had left the obstetric ward. all the infants were born by vaginal delivery and all were breast-fed during the period of sampling. none of the infants were treated with antibiotics during the sampling period. a total of  <dig> stool samples were collected.

identification of enterococcal isolates and growth conditions
from each stool sample, two cultures were prepared:  <dig> g fecal material was homogenized in 1)  <dig> ml deman-rogosa-sharpe  broth and 2)  <dig> ml arroyo, martin and cotton broth , by vortexing. serial dilutions were made and  <dig> μl of the 10- <dig> – 10- <dig> dilutions were plated on mrs- and amc agar plates, respectively. mrs plates were incubated aerobically over night  at 37°c, while amc plates were incubated anaerobically on at 37°c. plates were then examined for growth, and colonies with different morphology and from different plates were picked and inoculated in  <dig> ml mrs- or amc-broth, depending on which plates they were isolated from. the cultures were incubated as described above. genomic dna from each sample was isolated, and for identification, the 16s rrna gene from each isolate was amplified and sequenced using general 16s rdna primers . pcr was accomplished using dynazyme™ ii dna polymerase . thermocycling conditions were as follows:  <dig> min at 94°c; followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at 94°c,  <dig> s at 56°c, and  <dig>  min at 72°c; followed by  <dig> min at 72°c. a total of  <dig> different e. faecalis-isolates were identified, and further analyzed in this study . the  <dig> enterococcal isolates were isolated as part of two surveys of the content of lactic acid bacteria  in baby feces, hence, the culture media used were rich media, not particularly chosen to select for enterococci. in the present study, e. faecalis were grown aerobically on in brain heart infusion broth  at 37°c.

* isolate 92a was not genotyped for the presence of gele, and fsrb by pcr.

the isolates from infants a-c are listed chronologically, according to their time of isolation. isolates that have been genomotyped by cgh are listed in bold. cs; community surveillance, mlst; multilocus sequence typing, st; sequence type, cc; clonal complex, s; singleton, cps; capsular locus polymorphism type, abr; antibiotic resistance, a; ampicillin, e; erythromycin, g; gentamicin, t; tetracycline, ace; collagen-binding adhesin, agg; aggregation substance, esp; enterococcal surface protein, frsb;, gele; gelatinase, cyll; cytolysin l, cyl; cytolysin activity, gel; gelatinase activity.

mlst analysis
mlst was performed according to the scheme presented by ruiz-garbajosa et al.  <cit> , using the abi prism big dye cycle sequencing ready reaction kit  in an abi prismtm  <dig> genetic analyzer. sequence types were defined by the allelic variation at the seven loci aroe, gdh, gki, gyd, psts, xpt and yqil. isolates with the same sequence type are thought to be members of a single clone or lineage. clonal complexes were defined as groups of isolates that differed in no more than two of the seven loci analyzed, by use of eburst  <cit> . each clonal complex was designated after its ancestor sequence type  or the representative st that appeared with the highest frequency. all the mlst data from this study has been deposited into the e. faecalis mlst database .

phenotypic assays
cytolysin assay
hemolytic activity was qualitatively detected by the use of blood agar plates supplemented with 5%  defibrinated horse blood, 1%  glucose and  <dig> %  l-arginine   <cit> . overnight cultures were diluted 1: <dig>  spotted onto fresh plates and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. zones of clearing around colonies indicated production of cytolysin.

gelatinase assay
detection of gelatinase activity was performed by the use of todd-hewitt  agar plates containing 3% gelatin  <cit> . overnight cultures were diluted 1: <dig>  spotted onto fresh plates and incubated at 37°c overnight, before they were placed at 4°c for  <dig> h. zones of turbidity around colonies indicated hydrolysis of gelatin.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
bhi agar plates supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin,  <dig> μg/ml chloramphenicol,  <dig> μg/ml erythromycin,  <dig> μg/ml gentamicin,  <dig> μg/ml tetracycline or  <dig> μg/ml vancomycin were used. the plates were inoculated by spotting  <dig> μl  overnight culture  and incubated at 37°c overnight. growth was interpreted as resistance to the antibiotic added to the medium.

detection of genes encoding virulence factors and bacteriocin genes
the presence of ace, agg, esp, cyll and gele were detected by means of polymerase chain reactions  as previously described  <cit> . isolates were also tested for the presence of iole, iolr and genes coding for the following bacteriocins by pcr: enterocin a , enterocin b , enterocin p , enterolysin a , enterocin l <dig>  and enterocin 1071a and b . thermocycling conditions were as follows:  <dig> min at 94°c; followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at 94°c,  <dig> s at  <dig> ± 10°c, and  <dig> s at 72°c; followed by  <dig> min at 72°c. primers are listed in additional file  <dig> 

api  <dig> ch for determination of fermentation patterns
carbohydrate fermentation patterns were obtained for selected isolates with api  <dig> ch kits  according to the manufacturer's instructions.

comparative genomic hybridization
microarrays
the microarrays used in this work contained  <dig> open reading frames from the genome of enterococcus faecalis v <dig>  <cit>  represented by oligonucleotides . of these  <dig> orfs,  <dig> were chromosomal orfs and  <dig> were located on plasmids. in addition, ten genes from the pathogenicity island  of e. faecalis mmh <dig>  were represented  <cit> . the 70-mer oligos were supplied by invitrogen. the oligos were spotted in triplicates onto epoxy-coated glass slides . in order to reduce biases due to positional effects, the replicate spots were spotted at random positions within a subarray on the array. alien reporter sequences , without homology to any known nucleic acid sequences in public databases, were spotted as negative controls on the array. the microarray design has been deposited in the arrayexpress database with the accession number a-mexp- <dig> 

dna isolation
for cgh,  <dig> isolates were chosen based on their representation of mlst sequence type diversity across the babies and of novel sequence types. genomic dna was isolated by using the fp <dig> fastprep bead-beater  and the qiaprep miniprep kit  as follows:  <dig> ml overnight cultures were centrifuged for  <dig> min. at  <dig> rpm in an eppendorf 5804r tabletop centrifuge at 4°c, and pellets were resuspended in  <dig> μl rnasea-containing buffer p <dig> . the cell suspensions were transferred to  <dig> ml screw cap fastprep tubes  containing  <dig>  g acid-washed glass beads  . cells were lysed by shaking the tubes for  <dig> s at  <dig> m/s in the fastprep bead-beater. after a short spin, lysed cells were transferred to eppendorf tubes and  <dig> μl buffer p <dig> and  <dig> μl buffer n <dig> was added to each tube. then, the suspensions were centrifuged for  <dig> min. at  <dig> rpm in a tabletop centrifuge  at room temperature, before the supernatant fluids were loaded on to qiaprep spin columns. the columns were washed again and genomic dna was eluted according to the qiaprep spin miniprep kit protocol. concentration and purity of the genomic dna was measured using the nanodrop spectrophotometer .  <dig> μg genomic dna was used for each labeling reaction.

fluorescent labeling and hybridization
genomic dna was labeled and purified with the bioprime array cgh genomic labeling system  and cyanine smart pack dutp , according to the manufacturer's protocol.

purified samples were then dried, prior to resuspension in  <dig> μl hybridization solution  sds,  <dig> %  bovine serum albumin, 50%  formamide and  <dig> %  single-stranded salmon sperm dna) and hybridized for  <dig> h at 42°c to the e. faecalis oligonucleotide array in a tecan hs  <dig> pro hybridization station . arrays were washed twice at 42°c with  <dig> × ssc +  <dig> % sds, and twice at 23°c with  <dig> × ssc, followed by washes at 23°c with 1)  <dig>  × ssc and 2) h2o. two replicate hybridizations  were performed for each test strain. hybridized arrays were scanned at wavelengths of  <dig> nm  and  <dig> nm  with a tecan scanner ls . fluorescent intensities and spot morphologies were analyzed using genepix pro  <dig>  , and spots were excluded based on slide or morphology abnormalities. all water used for the various steps of the hybridization and for preparation of solutions was filtered  milliq dh <dig> 

data analysis
standard methods in the limma package  <cit>  in r , available from the bioconductor  were employed for preprocessing and normalization. within-array normalization was first conducted by subtracting the median from the log-ratios for each array. a standard loess-normalization was then performed, where smoothing was based only on spots with abs <  <dig>  to avoid biases due to extreme skewness in the log-ratio distribution. for the determination of present and divergent genes, a new method that predicts sequence identity based on array signals was used, as described by snipen et al.  <cit> . a brief description of the method follows: initially, all array probe sequences were queried against the fully sequenced v <dig> reference genome  in a blast search. the value rb for each probe was defined as the number of identical bases in the best local alignment found by blastn, divided by the probe length. given the sequence identity rb for each probe, the corresponding array signal ra will in general correlate in a positive way, i.e. stronger sequence identity yields stronger array signal. this postulation also holds for the unsequenced sample genome , where sa denote the array signal and sb the unknown sequence identity. the basic idea is that sb can be predicted from sa based on how sequence identity rb and array signal ra relate to each other. a threshold of  <dig>  was assigned to the sb-values in order to obtain a categorical response of presence or divergence, i. e. genes with sb-value >  <dig>  were classified as present, while genes with sb-value <  <dig>  were classified as divergent. in a comparison with other methods for analyzing cgh data as reviewed by carter et al.  <cit> , the proposed method gave significantly better classification of present/divergent. based on the fully sequenced genomes of v <dig> and og1rf  <cit> , tests gave sensitivity of  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig>  for detecting present probes based on cgh data.

comparative phylogenomics
the relationship of the reference strain and the test strains based on the presence and divergence of genes was determined with bayesian-based algorithms implemented through mr bayes  <dig>   <cit> , as previously described  <cit> . with samples and saves from every 40th tree,  <dig>  ×  <dig> generations of four incrementally heated markov chain monte carlos  were performed on the cgh data by using an annealing temperature of  <dig> , a burn-in of  <dig>  <dig> mcmc generations and an 8-category distribution. consensus trees and clade credibility values were visualized by using treeview version  <dig> . <dig> .

RESULTS
mlst – allelic variation in community-derived fecal e. faecalis baby isolates
the mlst analysis was performed on  <dig> e. faecalis-isolates, obtained from  <dig> healthy norwegian infants during their first year of life. these isolates were considered as legitimate representatives of commensal e. faecalis as they have been resident in the gut without causing any apparent negative effect to the health of the host. infants a-c were sampled once each month during the first six months and once after  <dig> months, and a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> different isolates were recovered from the respective infants over the period of sampling. infants d-k were sampled once during the first six months of life and 1– <dig> different isolates were obtained from these infants. from the  <dig> isolates,  <dig> different sequence types  were identified, of which four were novel sts . of these novel sts, st <dig> and st <dig>  were single-locus variants  of st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively. st <dig> and st <dig> belong to the previously defined clonal complex cc <dig>  in addition to the st <dig>  isolate that was detected in one of the infants, three different isolates displaying st <dig>  were obtained from the same infant  during the same month. other clonal complexes that were represented within our collection of isolates were cc <dig> , cc <dig> , cc <dig>  and cc <dig> . the remaining isolates were singletons.

several sts were detected multiple times, within different infants: st <dig> was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> infants, while st <dig> occurred in three different infants, and st <dig> and st <dig> were both detected in two different infants. the number of different sts for the three infants  monitored over  <dig> months, ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  some of these sts were detected only for a short period of time, while other sts persisted throughout the sampling period . no e. faecalis isolates were obtained from infant a and c at  <dig> months of age. this observation was probably due to the conditions for enterococcal selection not being stringent enough.

distribution of virulence genes, bacteriocin genes and antibiotic resistance profiles
single-concentration plate assays were used to assess resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracyline and vancomycin . tetracycline resistance was the most prevalent resistance trait among the baby isolates . moreover, a few of the isolates  showed erythromycin- or high-level gentamicin resistance. all isolates were also examined for the presence of the putative virulence factors ace, agg, cyll and esp by means of pcr. ace was amplified from all isolates, while 27/ <dig> isolates were agg+. esp is known to be associated with the e. faecalis pathogenicity island   <cit> , and was detected in 20/ <dig> of the isolates. cytolysin has been shown to contribute to virulence in animal models of enterococcal infections, and cyll, encoding one of the structural subunits of enterococcal cytolysin was present in 16/ <dig> of the isolates by pcr. cytolysin production was detected in 9/ <dig> of the isolates on blood agar plates. the isolates were also examined for gelatinase activity, which have been associated with virulence . 15/ <dig> isolates were gelatinase positive . since the absence of the regulator  can cause a lack of the gelatinase phenotype despite the presence of a positive gele genotype  <cit> , the isolates were also tested for the presence of gele and fsrb by pcr.  <dig> of the isolates were gele+ and  <dig> were fsrb+ . pcr-screening for content of bacteriocin genes among the test strains further discriminated between isolates with matching resistance profiles and virulence characteristics .

comparative genomic hybridization analysis
whole-genome cgh experiments on e. faecalis have previously shown that the main variations between the sequenced reference strain v <dig> and test strains relate to regions coding for integrated phages, plasmids and transposable elements in v <dig>  <cit> . in our experiments,  <dig> genes were classified as divergent in all  <dig> isolates,  <dig> of which are chromosomal genes in v <dig> . the majority of the divergent chromosomal genes are located within the following  <dig> previously identified mobile genetic elements  in v583: efac <dig> , phage <dig> , phage <dig> , vanb resistance region as defined by  <cit>  , efac <dig>  and phage <dig> . a large fraction of the  <dig> chromosomal genes code for hypothetical proteins  or conserved hypothetical proteins/conserved domain proteins . apparently, a great proportion of the variable gene pool consists of hypothetical orfs and this seems to be a common trait among prokaryotes  <cit> . none of the mges were entirely divergent in all of the commensal isolates, e.g. the content of pai genes in the isolates varied from  <dig> to  <dig> present genes of the  <dig> pai orfs represented on the array , and similar patterns of present and divergent genes between isolates may suggest that mge genes are often transferred in modules. the fact that only  <dig> of the plasmid-encoded genes on the array  were divergent in all the baby isolates is consistent with such an evolutionary scenario; however, the isolates have not been tested for plasmid content to further explore this hypothesis. the results of the microarray analysis were generally consistent with the phenotypic tests and the pcr analysis of the presence of virulence-associated genes, with a few exceptions only: the isolate 111a was esp+ by pcr, but esp- by cgh. the same isolate was also cyll+ by pcr and cyl+, but the entire cytolysin locus, except from paief <dig>  was divergent by cgh. the cyl+ phenotypes of the isolates 158b and  <dig> were also inconsistent with the cgh data for some of the additional pai genes on the array . the observed inconsistencies between phenotypes/pcr and cgh may be due to sequence variations in the microarray-probe target sequences in the test stains.

each of the fecal baby isolates showed a minimum of  <dig> % presence of probes represented on the array . the cgh analysis classified  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomal v <dig> orfs as present in all  <dig> isolates. this set of shared genes is slightly higher than the core genomes that were previously reported for e. faecalis  <cit> , probably due to the constricted environment and the limited geographical area, from which the isolates were obtained. the observed genetic variation among the investigated commensal e. faecalis shows that the genetic diversity is comparable to that among strains from other sources   <cit> . our data confirmed the establishment of phage <dig> as a part of the e. faecalis core genome.

the e. faecalis v <dig> genome contains  <dig> probable phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase  systems and pathways for exploitation of  <dig> different sugars have been predicted  <cit> . carbohydrate fermentation patterns obtained with api  <dig> ch kits for selected baby isolates whose gene content were also analyzed by cgh , showed only small differences in the metabolic capabilities of the test strains. also, compared to api  <dig> ch results previously obtained for v <dig>  <cit> , only minor variations were observed . these observations were supported by the high degree of conservation of genes encoding pts components revealed by the cgh data. the recent publication of the e. faecalis og1rf genome sequence revealed an iol operon that is not found in the v <dig> genome  <cit> . interestingly, two of the baby isolates  were, according to the api assay, able to ferment myo-inositol. all the baby isolates were therefore surveyed for the presence of iole and iolr by pcr. a total of  <dig> isolates, including 111a and  <dig>  were both iole+ and iolr+ . the presence of a partial iol operon in isolates  <dig> and  <dig> which were unable to ferment myo-inositol by the api assay is consistent with previous findings  <cit> .

phylogenomic analyses of the cgh data using bayesian-based algorithms revealed a distinct clade containing seven of the nine community-derived baby isolates . initial branching within this clade was also fairly reliable . the remaining three isolates seemed to be more divergent, and v <dig> formed a distinct out-group. based on this analysis, isolate  <dig>  appeared more closely related to v <dig>  than isolate 158b, which also displays st <dig>  nevertheless, the bayesian phylogeny suggested that the lineages defined by cgh generally correlated with those identified by mlst: within the latter clade, the isolates 92a and 29c  formed one separate clade . to further examine the correlation between mlst and cgh, additional cgh data obtained from the literature, in addition to unpublished data from five additional non-baby isolates of e. faecalis were included in the analysis. in this extended analysis, only genes  represented on all three arrays that were used in the different studies were considered. the clustering of identical sts was here further supported . previous studies have suggested that genomotyping of e. faecalis by cgh is heavily influenced by extensive horizontal transfer of mges in e. faecalis  <cit> . to further analyze the effect of mges in our data set, the cgh data were reanalyzed after all core- and mge genes had been removed from the gene list, as previously described  <cit> . the mge genes comprised putative mges predicted in v <dig>  <cit> , as well as an additional phage-related region identified by mcbride et al.  <cit> . this revision left a list of  <dig> genes . lindsay and coworkers  <cit>  previously denominated such genes core variable . the phylogenetic tree based on the content of cv genes in the isolates recovered a clade containing the same seven baby isolates as in the analysis with the entire probe set .

of the  <dig> cv genes,  <dig> genes code for hypothetical proteins. among the remaining functionally annotated cv genes, many genes are predicted to code for surface-exposed proteins in e. faecalis, e.g. the cps locus coding for the capsule in e. faecalis  <cit> . the cps locus of e. faecalis consists of  <dig> genes  and insertional inactivation of genes in this locus have resulted in mutants with enhanced susceptibility to phagocytic killing  <cit> . three different cps polymorphisms have been identified in e. faecalis so far: 1) type  <dig>  which includes all  <dig> genes, 2) type  <dig>  which includes all genes except cpsf and 3) type  <dig>  with only cpsa and cpsb present. all three polymorphisms were detected among our test strains, by cgh . the cps type has previously been found to be invariant within mlst sequence types in e. faecalis  <cit> , and our data is consistent with this finding. analysis of the cgh data with respect to the cps type suggested that the e. faecalis pai, or segments thereof, may be enriched among cps2-isolates. these observations support the hypothesis of convergence of enterococcal virulence determinants and cps <dig> by independent selection in e. faecalis  <cit> .

discussion
enterococci are among the first bacteria to colonize the neonatal gi tract  <cit> . though originally considered as harmless commensals, the enterococci now rank among the leading causes of nosocomial infections  <cit> . the present study was undertaken in an attempt to further explore the differences in the genetic make-up of e. faecalis. a total of  <dig> community-derived fecal baby isolates were sequence typed by mlst and characterized with respect to antibiotic resistance and properties associated with virulence. a subset of the isolates was genomotyped using genome-wide dna microarrays.

by mlst analysis, the  <dig> baby isolates were resolved into  <dig> sts and grouped into  <dig> genetic lineages, including  <dig> major clonal complexes  and  <dig> singletons . analyses with the mlst scheme employed in the present study have previously defined distinct clonal complexes of e. faecalis associated with the hospital environment, so-called high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes   <cit> . of the isolates included in this study, only 158b and 226b  grouped into one of these complexes . these isolates were obtained towards the end of the sampling period, and may therefore have been introduced through habituation to solid food or from the environment through fecal-oral contamination. to our knowledge, none of the infants were admitted to the hospital during the period of sampling, however, hospital contact cannot be excluded as a source for st <dig> isolates.

according to our results, several of the putative enterococcal virulence factors were widespread among the commensal baby isolates. these findings are in line with previous reports  <cit> , and may reflect the adaptive functions that these factors can hold in non-virulent contexts, as indicated by semedo et al.  <cit> . several of the virulence traits and antibiotic resistant phenotypes were common for all the isolates within the clonal complexes; however, the strain set is too small to deduce statistically significant association of features with clonal identity of isolates.

overall, our results highlight the importance of phenotypic assays to confirm genomics data as revealed by pcr and cgh. pcr confirmed the presence of cyll in the eight isolates that displayed hemolytic activity in our study, however, cyll was also found to be present in an additional eight cyl--isolates. a similar discrepancy between fermentation capabilities and the presence of iole and iolr was also observed. moreover, three isolates carrying both gele and fsrb came out as gele- in the plate assay. the confined genotype-phenotype correlation that is here reported, visualizes the need for phenotypic confirmation of genotypes.

esp which is known to be associated with the e. faecalis pathogenicity island   <cit> , was detected in two thirds of the commensal isolates by pcr. according to the cgh data, none of the baby isolates contained complete pais. these findings were as expected, considering that the pai has been shown to be enriched among infection-derived enterococcal isolates  <cit> . more surprisingly, but consistent with a previous report  <cit> , all the isolates studied contained some pai genes. several of the baby isolates showed similar patterns of present and divergent pai genes . this suggests that the evolution of the enterococcal pai may be driven by insertion and deletion of larger modules, as hypothesized in  <cit> . shankar et al. also suggested that parts of the enterococcal pai originate from pheromone-responsive plasmids, with subsequent indels of transposable elements driving the evolution of the pai  <cit> . indeed, conjugal transfer of a segment of the e. faecalis pai has been demonstrated  <cit> . the cgh revealed a high degree of plasticity within all the mges represented on the microarray. these "mosaic structures" may reflect a complex evolutionary history of elements that have been frequently rearranged by horizontal gene transfer  and homologous recombination.

according to the cgh data presented here, a preliminary e. faecalis core genome consisting of  <dig>  can be delineated. compiled analysis of the data from aakra et al. and mcbride et al.  <cit>  with the data from the present study produced a core genome estimate of  <dig> genes. an additional  <dig> genes were only represented on one or two of the three different arrays used, but were defined as core genes in these experiments. although the size of the core genome may fluctuate due to the stringency of the statistical methods used in the different studies, our data do add substantial information on the e. faecalis core genome.

in general, the genomic variation between isolates that are evolutionary -linked, e.g. isolates with the same st, was expected to be lower than the variation between isolates that belong to different evolutionary lineages. bayesian-based phylogenetic analysis confirmed these expectations . mcbride et al. previously reported genomotyping by cgh to be biased by the activity of mges in e. faecalis  <cit> , and we therefore repeated the bayesian analysis, using the cv genes, only. the phylogenetic analysis based on cv genes recovered the same patterns of relatedness as the analysis comprising all genes, with slight internal rearrangements of branches . these rearrangements supported the hypothesis on the distribution of mobile elements as a source of genomic diversity in e. faecalis. moreover, our data suggest that within lineages, most of the variation detected by cgh is due to mges. however, the conserved clade identified by the analyses based both on the cv genes and the complete gene-set, indicates that also other and more complex discriminatory factors contribute to the genomic diversity in e. faecalis. since an overall correlation between cgh and mlst was revealed, it is reasonable to believe that genes contributing to the formation of clades, i.e. lineage-specific genes may be identified. in the  <dig> baby isolates that formed a clade in the phylogenetic analysis, we were able to recognize  <dig> genes that were divergent, but present in the remaining three isolates . the majority of these genes were mge genes located in phage <dig> , phage <dig>  and a phage-related region identified by mcbride et al.  <cit>  . lepage et al. have previously reported phage <dig> to be absent from several food isolates  <cit> . since st <dig> is part of cc <dig>  which has been found to be significantly enriched among nosocomial isolates, phage <dig> may potentially represent an element associated with increased fitness in the hospital environment. the latter report also identified eight genes as potential markers for the v583/mmh594-lineage  <cit> . v <dig> and mmh <dig> both display st <dig>  <cit> , and five of the eight genes  were also present in the st6-isolates  analyzed by cgh in our study.

comparative genome analyses have revealed that pathogen evolution often progresses through gene acquisition via hgt  <cit> . the  <dig> genes that were characterized as divergent in all the community-derived baby isolates by cgh may be potential pathogen-specific genes in e. faecalis, or genes that are specific to v <dig>  however, additional cgh data from both pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates are needed to address this issue. vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis  isolates appear to be widely spread in hospital environments, while isolation of vrefs from healthy volunteers rarely occurs  <cit> . accordingly, the vanb operon was divergent in all the isolates studied by cgh in our lab . in addition to gene acquisition, pathoadaptive mutations via gene loss also plays an important role in evolution of bacteria  <cit> . a disadvantage of the comparative genomic analyses presented here, is that the comparison of gene content is based on a single reference strain , only. the e. faecalis og1rf genome showed that, in addition to a shared core of  <dig> orfs  <cit> , both the v <dig> and the og1rf genome carry unique genes, suggesting that the e. faecalis pan-genome will be further extended as more strains will be sequenced. the availability of additional e. faecalis genome sequences and the construction of a pan-species array would further increase the sensitivity of such approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here suggest that the genetic variation among the investigated commensal e. faecalis is comparable to the genetic variation previously detected in a strain set thought to be representative of the major e. faecalis lineages. the widespread distribution of putative virulence determinants in the fecal baby isolates in this study supports the conception of enterococcal virulence, not as a result of any single virulence factor, but as a more complex process. population structure studies of e. faecalis by mlst have identified so-called high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes , defined as distinct genetic complexes that predominate among nosocomial infections. the failure to identify a shared set of pathogen-specific genes in e. faecalis so far opens up the possibility that the fitness and virulence of different hireccs may be due to genes that are unique within a lineage, but that the combined effects of the different gene-sets result in the same phenotype, i.e. infection. the observed correlation between cgh and mlst presented here, may offer a method for the identification of lineage-specific genes, and may therefore add clues on how to distinguish pathogenic from commensal e. faecalis.
