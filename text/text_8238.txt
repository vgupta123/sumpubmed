BACKGROUND
the aminoacyl trna synthetase  family of enzymes function to attach amino acids to their cognate trnas  <cit> . each enzyme specifically charges a trna with its cognate amino acid in an energy requiring reaction that is executed with very high fidelity. however, despite all aarss carrying out essentially the same reaction, the aars family is subdivided into class i and class ii enzymes that are structurally distinct and unrelated phylogenetically . this division of aars into class i and class ii enzymes is universal with each aars being a member of one or other enzyme class in all living organisms. the lysyl-trna synthetase  is an exception in that both class i  and class ii  variants exist  <cit> . lysrs <dig> enzymes are found in archaebacteria and in some eubacteria  while lysrs <dig> enzymes are found in most eubacteria and all eukaryotes. interestingly some bacteria have both class i lysrs <dig> and class ii lysrs <dig> enzymes. for example, in methanosarcina barkeri the class i and class ii lysrs enzymes function as a complex to charge trnapyl with the rare pyrolysine amino acid while in b. cereus strain  <dig> both enzymes can function together to aminoacylate a small trna-like molecule  that functions to control expression trprs <dig>  <cit> .

sustaining charged trnas at levels adequate for the protein synthetic needs of growth under each environmental and nutritional condition is crucial for cell survival. achieving this mandates that expression of each aars be responsive to the cellular level of their charged cognate trnas. therefore the mechanisms controlling aars expression must be able to distinguish their cognate trna from other trna species and be able to measure the extent to which the pool of cognate trna is charged. expression of the majority of aarss in bacillus subtilis is regulated by the t box antitermination mechanism  <cit> . this mechanism was first discovered in studies on the regulation of threonyl- and tyrosyl-trna synthetase expression in b. subtilis  <cit> , for a review see  <dig>  the t box elements are widely distributed, being present in firmicutes, δ-proteobacteria, chloroflexi, deinococcales/thermales and actinobacteria, and control expression of genes involved in cellular activities other than trna charging such as amino acid biosynthesis, amino acid transport and regulation of amino acid metabolism  <cit> .

the t-box regulatory element is usually a 200- <dig> nucleotide untranslated rna leader sequence containing a conserved t box sequence, stem-loop structures and a conditional rho-independent terminator located upstream of the start codon  <cit> . two specific interactions between trnas and t box leader sequences enable recognition of cognate trna species and distinction between charged and uncharged pools of trna. the ncca sequence in the acceptor stem of a nonacylated-trna interacts with the uggn sequence within the t box sequence   <cit> . this interaction cannot occur when a trna is aminoacylated, thereby distinguishing between charged and uncharged trnas. specificity for cognate trnas is achieved by the presence of a specifier codon within a bulge in stem i of the leader sequence that interacts with the anticodon sequence of each trna. . thus for t box control of aars expression, a high level of an uncharged trna  causes interaction between that trna and its cognate t box element that stabilizes the anti-termination structure of the leader sequence allowing transcription of the aars gene to proceed. a high level of aminoacylated-trnas in contrast cannot interact with the leader sequence allowing formation of the rho-independent terminator and preventing continued transcription of the gene.

while most eubacteria encode either a class i or a class ii lysrs, all sequenced strains of b. cereus  and b. thuringiensis encode a copy of both enzyme types  <cit> . in bacillus cereus strain  <dig>  the lysrs2-encoding lyss gene is positioned at the end of an operon encoding genes involved in folate metabolism, its normal position in most bacilli while the lysk gene encoding the class i-type lysrs <dig> is located elsewhere on the chromosome. shaul et al.  show that this lysrs <dig> is closely related to the class i lysrs <dig> of pyrococcus, suggesting that it has been acquired by b. cereus by horizontal transfer  <cit> . the function of lysrs <dig> in b. cereus is not clear but it is expressed predominantly in stationary phase and can aminoacylate a novel trna species  in concert with the class ii lysrs enzyme  <cit> . thus it may play a role in surviving nutritional downshift in b. cereus.

ataide and colleagues reported the presence of a putative t box regulatory element upstream of the lysk coding sequence in b. cereus strain  <dig>  <cit> . this was the first reported instance of putative control of lysrs expression by a t box mechanism. here we investigate control of lysrs expression by a t box mechanism, confirming that it occurs only very rarely in bacteria. we show that the t box element of the lysk gene of b. cereus strain  <dig> is functional and responds to an increased level of uncharged trnalys in a canonical manner. interestingly, this t box element shows some promiscuity in its specificity by responding to a reduced cellular level of asparaginyl-trnaasn. we also show that strains of b. subtilis, in which expression of the endogenous lysrs <dig> or the heterologous lysrs <dig> is controlled by this t box element, are viable.

RESULTS
regulation of lysyl trna synthetase expression by a t-box antitermination mechanism occurs rarely
a search of the upstream region of aars-encoding genes in  <dig> completely sequenced bacterial genomes identified  <dig> t box elements. significant variation in the frequency with which individual aars are regulated by a t box mechanism was observed in this cohort, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . control of lysrs expression by t box elements occurs very rarely, being documented in only  <dig> bacterial species: all sequenced b. cereus strains ; in b. thuringiensis strains konkukian and al hakam; in clostridium beijerinckii and in symbiobacterium thermophilum  <cit> . these cases display several interesting features :  all bacterial species with t-box regulated lysrs expression have a second lysrs that is not t-box regulated;  the phylogenetically related b. cereus and b. thuringiensis species each have a class ii lysrs <dig> and a t-box regulated class i lysrs <dig> - these t box regulatory elements show very high sequence conservation ;  conversely in s. thermophilum, the class ii lysrs <dig>  is regulated by a t box element with little similarity to that found in the bacillus species  while the class i lysrs <dig>  is not t box regulated and  c. beijerincki has two classii lysrs , one of which  is regulated by a t box element that displays clear sequence similarity  to the t box found in the bacillus species , but little similarity to the t box element of s. thermophilum . thus t box regulated lysrs expression is very rare and is invariably accompanied by a second non-t-box regulated  lysrs. two separate t box elements were identified - one controlling expression of a class ii lysrs <dig> in s. thermophilum and the second controlling expression of a class i lysrs <dig> in b. cereus and b. thuringiensis but a class ii lysrs <dig> in c. beijerinckii

the t-box element controlling expression of lysk in b. cereus strain  <dig> is functional
the t-box element in the b. cereus and b. thuringiensis strains has a canonical structure  <cit> , is highly conserved and controls expression of a class i lysrs  of pyrococcal origin  <cit> . interestingly, the lysk gene is expressed predominantly during stationary phase in b. cereus strain  <dig>  whereas the class ii lysrs is expressed during exponential growth of this bacterium  <cit> . to ascertain whether this t-box element is functional, expression of a plysk lacz transcriptional fusion  was established under conditions of lysine starvation  and lysrs <dig> depletion . the results are shown in figure  <dig>  when strain nf <dig> is grown in lysine replete medium, only a low level of plysk lacz expression  is observed . however growth in a lysine depleted medium  results in a high level of plysk lacz expression, with accumulation of ~ <dig> units of β-galactosidase activity. importantly plysk lacz induction is coincident with the point of growth cessation due to lysine deficiency . to confirm that increased plysk lacz expression is associated with increased levels of uncharged trnalys, strain bcj <dig>  lacz) was grown in the presence of  <dig> mm iptg,  <dig> μm iptg and  <dig> μm iptg. growth of the cultures containing  <dig> mm and  <dig> μm iptg was similar to that of wild-type strain  <dig> while growth of the cultures with  <dig> μm iptg was reduced, presumably due to a decreased level of charged lysyl-trnalys . expression of plysk lacz is low  in cultures containing  <dig> mm iptg. plysk lacz expression is initially low in cultures containing  <dig> μm iptg but gradually increases with accumulation of ~ <dig> units of β-galactosidase activity at the onset of stationary phase. however in cultures with  <dig> μm iptg, plysk lacz expression increases throughout exponential growth with accumulation of more than  <dig> units of β-galactosidase during this period . to confirm that this increased plysk lacz expression is due to increased levels of uncharged trnalys caused by lysrs <dig> depletion, a culture was grown for  <dig> minutes in the presence of  <dig> μm iptg at which point, the iptg concentration was increased to  <dig> mm . results showed accumulation of ~ <dig> units of β-galactosidase activity at  <dig> minutes but this level decreased subsequent to iptg addition and continued to decrease for the remaining period of exponential growth . it is noteworthy that the growth rate also increased upon iptg addition . as a control we established that plysk lacz expression is not induced by cellular depletion of phenylalanine showing that its induction shows the expected specificity . these data show that the t box regulatory element found in the control region of the class i lysk gene of b. cereus strain  <dig> is functional and responds to increased levels of uncharged trnalys in a canonical manner.

a b. subtilis strain expressing the b. cereus class i lysk under t box regulatory control is viable
the rarity of the t box control of lysrs expression, and where found, occurs only in conjunction with a second cellular lysrs, prompted us to ask whether t box control of lysrs expression is compatible with viability. to address this question, b. subtilis strain nf <dig>  lysk ∂lyss) was constructed in which expression of the b. cereus lysk gene is under the control of its natural promoter and t box regulatory element in single copy at the amye locus and the endogenous lyss gene is partially deleted  by a double cross-over event. it is important to note that in strain nf <dig> the plysk lysk cassette is flanked by transcriptional terminators, ensuring that lysk expression is solely dependent on the plysk promoter. this strain was successfully constructed and verified by pcr and southern blot analysis and by sequencing of selected regions . this confirms that in b. subtilis t box mediated control of lysrs <dig> expression is compatible with viability. to establish whether nf <dig> has a phenotype, growth profiles were established in rich  and minimal media and compared with wild-type b. subtilis strain  <dig>  results show an increase in the generation time of strain nf <dig> during growth in lb medium: nf <dig> has a doubling time of ~ <dig> minutes while that of wild-type strain  <dig> is ~ <dig> minutes under these conditions. however strain nf <dig> does not grow in minimal medium whereas wild-type strain  <dig> has a generation time of ~ <dig> minutes in this medium. to establish whether this growth phenotype was due to reduced trnalys charging, the plysk lacz was introduced into strain nf <dig> generating strain nf <dig>  reduced charging of trnalys in strain nf <dig> will result in increased β-galactosidase accumulation when compared with strain bcj <dig> that has the plysk lacz contruct in an otherwise wild-type background . results show that 250- <dig> units of β-galactosidase accumulate during exponential growth of strain nf <dig>  an ~20-fold increase over that observed in the control strain bcj <dig>  we conclude t box control of lysr <dig> expression is compatible with viability of b. subtilis. however such strains have a reduced growth rate in rich medium and cannot be propagated in minimal medium probably due to reduced trnalys charging.

a b. subtilis strain with expression of the endogenous class ii lyss under the control of the t box regulatory element is viable and indistinguishable from wild-type in terms of growth and trnalys charging
while t box control of lysrs <dig> expression supports growth of b. subtilis, the level of charged trnalys is reduced and there is a growth phenotype. however it is unclear whether this phenotype is caused by t box regulation of lysrs expression or is due to the b. cereus derived class i lysrs <dig> enzyme that is reported to be less efficient catalytically than its class ii counterpart  <cit> . to distinguish between these possibilities and to further address the issue of t box regulation of lysrs, we constructed strain nf <dig>  lyss) that placed expression of the endogenous b. subtilis lyss gene under the control of the lysk promoter and t box element from b. cereus strain  <dig>  it is important to note that in strain nf <dig> the plysk lyss cassette is flanked by transcriptional terminators ensuring that lyss expression is solely dependent on the plysk promoter. strain nf <dig> was successfully constructed and the relevant chromosomal regions verified by pcr and southern blotting  confirming that t box regulation of lysrs <dig> expression supports growth of b. subtilis. importantly growth of strain nf <dig> in rich  and minimal media  was indistinguishable from wild-type strain  <dig> . the level of charged trnalys was assessed in strain nf <dig> by introducing the plysk lacz transcriptional fusion to generate strain nf <dig>  approximately  <dig> units of β-galactosidase accumulated during exponential growth of strain nf <dig> similar to control strain bcj <dig> . we conclude that t box control of lyss expression is compatible with growth of b. subtilis. it is likely that the growth and trnalys charging deficiency of strains nf <dig> and nf <dig>  is caused by decreased efficiency of trnalys charging by lysrs <dig> rather than by t box control of its expression.

the t box element associated with the b. cereus class i lysrs <dig> can be partially induced by asparagine starvation
the results presented show that while t box regulation of lysrs expression occurs very rarely and invariably in conjunction with a non-t box regulated paralogue, control of expression of the main lysrs by a t box mechanism is compatible with viability. this prompted us to question why t box regulation of lysrs expression does not occur more frequently. we noted that expression of neither lysrs nor asnrs is regulated by a t box mechanism in bacilli and that these two amino acids are encoded in a mixed codon box . we therefore hypothesized that the t box element that controls expression of the class i lysrs <dig> of b. cereus may be inducible both by uncharged trnalys and trnaasn. a prediction of this hypothesis is that cellular depletion of charged trnaasn may induce expression of plysk lacz. to test this hypothesis, strain nf <dig>  lacz) was constructed containing the asns gene under the control of the inducible pspac promoter  and the plysk lacz to monitor induction. the growth profiles of nf <dig> cultures containing  <dig> mm and  <dig> μm iptg were identical, but β-glactosidase accumulation differed significantly under these two conditions. approximately  <dig> units of β-galactosidase accumulated during exponential growth of the culture containing  <dig> mm iptg while more than  <dig> units of β-galactosidase accumulated during exponential growth of the culture containing  <dig> μm iptg . to exclude the possibility that depleting cellular levels of asnrs leads to a concomitant increase in the uncharged trnalys level  lacz expression) we established the highest iptg concentration at which some induction of plysk lacz occurred but at which growth of the culture was unaffected. the growth profiles of nf <dig> cultures containing  <dig> mm iptg and  <dig> μm iptg are identical . however ~20- <dig> units of β-galactosidase accumulate during exponential growth of the culture containing  <dig> mm iptg while more than  <dig> units of β-galactosidase accumulate during exponential growth of the culture containing  <dig> μm iptg. importantly the kinetics of plysk lacz expression differed in the two cultures: an increase in β-galactosidase accumulation is evident in the  <dig> μm culture that is not seen in the  <dig> mm iptg culture. to verify that this induction is not due to an increased level of uncharged trnalys, the cellular level of lysyl-trnalys was measured in wild-type strain  <dig> and in cultures of nf <dig> grown in  <dig> mm and  <dig> μm iptg . it is clear that the level of lysyl-trnalys is approximately the same  in both iptg-containing cultures of nf <dig>  a level that is higher than that observed  in cultures of wild-type b. subtilis strain  <dig> grown in the same medium . as an additional control, we measured plysk lacz expression and charged trnalys levels in cultures of strain bcj <dig>  lacz) growing in  <dig> mm and  <dig> μm iptg. approximately 20- <dig> units of β-galactosidase accumulated in both cultures and importantly the level of charged trnalys in both cultures was ~83% .

we then sought to establish  if depletion of the cellular level of a charged trna leads to a general reduction in level of other charged trnas and  if some level of cross-induction exists among t box elements controlling expression of aars that charge the constituent trnas of mixed codon boxes in b. subtilis. to address both issues, transcriptional fusions of the promoter and t box element of the phes, iles and trps aars genes of b. subtilis with the lacz reporter gene were constructed. each fusion was introduced into strains auxotrophic for their cognate amino acids and into strains auxotrophic for the non-cognate amino acid in the mixed codon box. in each case, depletion for the cognate amino acid resulted in immediate induction of β-galactosidase expression while depletion for the non-cognate amino acid did not induce β-galactosidase expression to a significant level in any case . these data show that depletion for an individual amino acid does not lead to a general increase in the level of uncharged trnas of other amino acids and that promiscuous cross-induction of t box controlled promoters by depletion of the non-cognate amino acid of a mixed codon box does not occur in b. subtilis.

we conclude that the t box element controlling expression of lysk encoding the class i lysrs <dig> of b. cereus strain  <dig> displays some promiscuity of induction, being capable of responding to an increased level of uncharged trnaasn in addition to uncharged trnalys. however such promiscuous cross-induction is not a general feature of t box elements in b. subtilis.

discussion
t box regulation of lysrs expression occurs rarely and in exceptional circumstances
the t box mechanism is widely employed to regulate aars expression in a manner that is responsive to the level of uncharged cognate trna in the cell. of  <dig> t box elements associated with regulation of aars expression in  <dig> completely sequenced bacterial genomes identified in our analysis, potential t box control of lysrs expression was identified in only  <dig> bacterial species: t box elements were identified in all sequenced strains of b. cereus  and b. thuringiensis, in association with a class i lysrs <dig> of pyrococcal origin  <cit> ; a t box element was identified in c. beijerinckii associated with a class ii lysrs <dig>  <cit>  and a t box element was identified in s. thermophilum, associated with a class i lysrs <dig>  <cit> . the t box elements in the bacillus and clostridium species are homologous: the t box elements of the bacillus strains are ~92% identical while ~50% identity exists between the t box elements of the bacillus and clostridium species . however the t box element of s. thermophilum appears unrelated to the other t box elements . this is especially interesting since despite its high g+c  content, s. thermophilum proteins are more similar to those of the low g+c firmicutes such as bacilli and clostridia than to the high g+c actinobacteria. in view of this, it is also interesting that among the homologous t box elements, those in the bacilli are associated with a class i lysrs while the t box element in c. beijerinckii is associated with a class ii lysrs. thus t box regulation of lysrs expression appears to have evolved on two separate occasions, and one t box element has been conjoined with two different lysrs-encoding genes.

there are several interesting features about this cohort of t box regulated lysrs:  all bacterial species with a t box regulated lysrs have a second lysrs that is not t box regulated;  the four t box elements in the phylogenetically related b. cereus and b. thuringiensis species are associated with a class i lysrs <dig> and display ~92% identity;  the class i lysrs <dig> of b. cereus and b. thuringiensis is most closely related to lysrs <dig> from pyrococcal species suggesting that a common ancestor of b. cereus/thuringiensis acquired it by a lateral gene transfer event  <cit> ;  the t box regulated lysrs <dig> in b. cereus strain  <dig> is expressed predominantly in stationary phase  <cit>  and  t box elements do not occur in archaebacteria. the likely pyrococcal origin of b. cereus lysrs <dig> and the absence of t box elements in archaebacteria presents an interesting question as to how the regulatory sequence and structural gene were conjoined in this case. perhaps trnalys-responsive t box elements were more common in the ancestor of firmicutes  and were selectively lost as controlling elements of the principal cellular lysrs, but were retained for control of ancillary lysrs enzyme expression. a second interesting possibility, especially in view of the fact that it can be induced by trnaasn, is that the t box element associated with lysk of b. cereus may have evolved from an element with a specificity determinant similar in sequence to that of lysine. these observations suggest that t box regulation may be unsuited for controlling expression of the housekeeping lysrs in bacteria and perhaps is only tolerated in additional copies of lysrs that play an ancillary role such as adaptation to stationary phase conditions as observed in b. cereus. determining whether the other t box regulated lyss genes play an ancillary role requires further investigation. notably, t box regulation of housekeeping aminoacyl trna synthetases is widespread, suggesting that it is some aspect of lysine metabolism that makes t box control of lysrs expression unsuitable as a regulatory mechanism.

the lysrs <dig> t box element from b. cereus is functional and b. subtilis strains with t box control of lysrs <dig> and lysr <dig> expression are viable
the unknown provenance and functionality of the t box element, despite the reported theoretical capability to form canonical t box element structures  <cit>  prompted us to verify that it was functional and to ask whether strains of b. subtilis expressing a single copy of lysrs <dig> or lysrs <dig> controlled by this t box element are viable. we chose to conduct this study in b. subtilis because of the paucity of relevant auxotrophic b. cereus strains and other difficulties with antibiotic resistance and transformability. however we consider b. subtilis to be a valid model system in which to conduct this study. our results show that the t box element is functional and can be induced up to 120-fold in response to lysine- or lysrs-depletion but not by depletion of non-cognate amino acids. also strains of b. subtilis with expression of the endogenous lysrs <dig> controlled by this t box element are viable, and could not be distinguished from b. subtilis wild-type strain  <dig> during growth in rich or minimal medium. while a strain of b. subtilis expressing lysrs <dig> controlled by the t box element from b. cereus strain  <dig> is also viable, it displays a growth defect when grown in rich medium and cannot be propagated in minimal medium. however it is likely that these phenotypes result from the reduced catalytic activity of class i lysrs enzyme rather than from control of expression by the t box element. these results show there is no a priori reason precluding control of lysrs expression by a trnalys-responsive t box element. it emphasizes the puzzling rarity of t box regulated lysrs expression and the restriction of its occurrence in b. cereus strain  <dig> to controlling expression of a lysrs <dig> enzyme that plays an ancillary role in adapting cells to adverse conditions.

the t box element controlling expression of lysrs <dig> in b. cereus strain  <dig> can be induced by an increased level of uncharged trnaasn
the unusual occurrence of trnalys-responsive t box elements and the experimentally demonstrated viability of b. subtilis strains with t box regulated lysrs expression prompted us to investigate why t box regulation of lysrs expression is rare. we noted a tendency in b. subtilis for non-t box regulated aars  to charge trnas with amino acids encoded in mixed codon boxes . this observation, together with its possible origin being a t box element that is responsive to a different trna, prompted us to investigate whether the t box element controlling lysrs <dig> expression in b. cereus might also be induced by depletion of asparaginyl-trnaasn. our results show that cellular depletion of asnrs in b. subtilis results in induction of the plysk lacz. we show that this induction is not caused by concomitant depletion of lysyl-trnalys since induction occurs when cellular levels of charged trnalys are high . importantly, there is no direct link in the biosynthetic pathways of lysine and asparagine. also, expression of plysk lacz does not occur when cells are depleted for phenylalanine, showing that induction displays the expected specificity for lysine starvation. these data show that the t box element controlling expression of lysrs <dig> of b. cereus can be induced by an increased level of uncharged trnalys and trnaasn. however such promiscuity of induction is restricted to this lysk-associated t box element since t box element control of expression of aarss within mixed codon boxes is frequently found  <cit>  and induction of the t box-controlled phes, iles and trps genes was not observed in response to starvation for the non-cognate amino acid of the mixed codon box. the induction promiscuity of the b. cereus lysrs1-associated t box element might derive from its having evolved from a t box element that responded to a different trna. such promiscuity may be tolerated since lysrs <dig> in b. cereus appears to have an ancillary role during stationary phase, or it may even be advantageous in that it makes lysrs <dig> expression responsive to a broader range of adverse nutritional conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
the t box regulatory element makes expression of aars responsive to the uncharged level of their cognate trna and is widely used among bacteria. however significant variability exists in the frequency with which expression of individual aarss is controlled by this mechanism  <cit> , this study. it is largely unknown why t box regulation of lysrs expression is found in only  <dig> bacterial species  while more than  <dig> instances of t box control of ilers expression are documented. moreover these four bacterial species with a t box regulated lysrs all have a second non-t box regulated lysrs. we report that two trnalys-responsive t box elements exist: the first is found in the bacillus and clostridium species controlling expression of a class i lysrs <dig> in bacillus but a class ii lysrs <dig> in clostridium; the second in s. thermophilum displays little homology to the first t box element and controls expression of a class ii lysrs <dig>  we established that the t box element associated with lysk expression in b. cereus strain  <dig> is functional, but unusually responds to an increased level of uncharged trnalys and trnaasn. since lysrs <dig> is expressed mainly in stationary phase, this unusual induction profile may make its expression responsive to a wider range of nutritional signals. we also demonstrated that b. subtilis cells, in which expression of the endogenous lyss is controlled by the lysk t box element from b. cereus, are viable and are indistinguishable from wild-type b. subtilis strain  <dig> in terms of growth and trnalys charging. thus there appears to be no a priori reason why expression of the main cellular lysrs is not regulated by a t box element in b. subtilis , making the rarity of t box control of lysrs expression among bacteria even more puzzling.
