BACKGROUND
the genus gossypium contains many species of great economic and scientific importance. cotton produces the worldâ€™s most important natural textile fiber and is also a significant oilseed crop. the cotton fiber is an outstanding model in which to study plant cell elongation and cell wall and cellulose biosynthesis  <cit> . genetic improvement of fiber production and processing will ensure that this natural renewable product will be competitive with petroleum-derived synthetic fibers. moreover, modifying cottonseed for food and feed could profoundly enhance the nutrition and livelihoods of millions of people in food-challenged economies  <cit> . although cotton genome sequencing has been undertaken by a scientific consortium, cotton genomics has failed to keep pace with the accomplishments in genome sequencing in other angiosperms such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , poplar <cit> , rice  <cit> , and grapevine <cit>  etc.

the genus gossypium includes approximately  <dig> species,  <dig> diploid  and  <dig> tetraploids . diploid cotton species contain eight genome types, denoted a-g and k  <cit> . interestingly, the a genome diploids and tetraploid species produce spinnable fiber and are cultivated on a limited scale, whereas the d genome species do not  <cit> . in the a genome, d genome and ad genome, the genome sizes vary by approximately 3-fold, from  <dig> mb in the d genome to  <dig>  mb in the tetraploid  <cit> . genome size in cotton is not only much larger than in arabidopsis thaliana, poplar, grapevine and rice, but the cotton genome has also experienced a higher frequency of genome polyploidization events than any of these species  <cit> , although the grapevine genome appears to be an ancient hexaploid  <cit> . much of the size variation in cotton genomes can be attributed to accumulation of transposable elements, although some lineages show evidence of specific mechanisms to remove repetitive dna  <cit> . repetitive elements comprise approximately 50% of the d genome  <cit> . because of this, progress in cotton genome sequencing has lagged behind other flowering plants.

genomic resources for cotton such as bacterial artificial chromosomes , expressed sequence tags , genomic sequences, genetic linkage maps, and physical maps provide landmarks for sequence analysis and assembly. since the first genetic map of cotton was published in  <dig>  <cit> , several high-density genetic maps composed of more than  <dig>  loci have been released  <cit> . these high-density maps were constructed with multiple types of dna markers including restriction fragment-length polymorphisms   <cit> , amplified fragment-length polymorphisms   <cit> , sequence-related amplified polymorphisms   <cit> , single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> , and simple sequence repeats   <cit> . genome-wide integration of genetic and physical maps is a prerequisite for large-scale genome sequencing, which can in turn provide initial insights into the structure, function, and evolution of plant genomes  <cit> . in the development of genomic resources in cotton, bac libraries have been constructed for several cotton species  <cit> . the physical map of homoeologous chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in upland cotton  <cit> , and a draft physical map of a d-genome cotton species   <cit>  have been reported.

at present, a large number of cotton sequences are publically available via the genbank database . of these, approximately  <dig>  are expressed sequence tags , including  <dig>  ests from g. hirsutum,  <dig>  from g. raimondii,  <dig>  from g. arboreum,  <dig>  from g. barbadense, and  <dig> from g. herbaceum. furthermore, genome sequence information produced by several high-throughput dna sequencing platforms, such as the roche/ <dig> flx and the illumina genome analyzer, have been released for several cotton species. a pilot study by the u.s. department of energy joint genome institute  to generate a whole-genome scaffold sequence for g. raimondii was recently completed. however, draft genome sequences lack sufficient contiguity in many genomic regions to allow for cross-species comparison of genome organization and structure  <cit> . an independent genetic map often facilitates the correct ordering of dna segments on chromosomes and can thus clarify the changes in genome organization revealed by multiple species comparisons  <cit> . as a result, structural, functional, and evolutionary studies in gossypium will largely be accelerated and a whole-genome sequence will ultimately be realized.

in this paper, we report an update to a high-density interspecific genetic map in allotetraploid cultivated cotton based on earlier work in our laboratory  <cit> . using the high-density linkage map, we developed the genome-wide sequences analysis by the integration of high-density genetic map and publically-available gossypium dna sequence. this study will serve as a valuable genomic resource for tetraploid cotton genome sequencing, assembly and further comparative genomic analyses in gossypium.

RESULTS
a newly updated tetraploid cotton genetic map composed of  <dig>  loci in  <dig> linkage groups
we integrated an additional  <dig>  polymorphic marker loci into our previously published linkage map that contained  <dig>  loci and spanned  <dig> . <dig> cm  <cit> . the new marker loci comprised a variety of marker types, including  <dig> genomic-ssr loci,  <dig> est-ssrs,  <dig> remaps,  <dig> snps,  <dig> indels,  <dig> rts, nine aflps, seven sraps and one derived from a bac-end sequence. of these, three new marker types, indel, snp and remap, were used to increase the density of the new genetic map . as a result, we constructed a newly-updated genetic map composed of  <dig>  loci in  <dig> linkage groups covering  <dig> . <dig> cm with an average inter-locus distance of  <dig>  cm .

the enhanced linkage groups account for  <dig>  loci  with  <dig>  cm interval distance in the a-subgenome and  <dig>  loci  with  <dig>  cm interval distance in the d-subgenome, respectively. on average, each chromosome has  <dig> loci, ranging from a high of  <dig> loci on d <dig>  to a low of  <dig> loci on a <dig>  the longest chromosome in terms of genetic distance was a <dig> , and the shortest was a <dig> . compared with the previously published map  <cit> , intervals of > <dig> cm remaining in the tetraploid map were reduced to  <dig> - nine in the at subgenome, and seven in the dt subgenome, with the largest number of gaps on chromosome d <dig>  and the largest overall gap on chromosome a <dig>   <dig>  cm .

duplication, rearrangement and translocation in allotetraploid cottons
in this new map,  <dig> duplicated loci were identified by  <dig> ssr primer pairs, with  <dig> duplicated,  <dig> triplicated, and eight tetraplicated loci . of these,  <dig> % duplicated loci sufficiently bridged  <dig> expected homologous at/dt chromosomes. the remaining  <dig> duplicated loci were present on non-homologous chromosomes, of which  <dig> % loci were found to be located on the same chromosomes, whereas  <dig> % loci spanned different chromosomes. this finding implied that there had been multiple rounds of duplication and both intrachromosome and interchromosome genome rearrangements during the process of evolution . furthermore, two post-polyploidization reciprocal translocations of a2/a <dig> and a4/a <dig> in the at subgenome were confirmed to have  <dig> homologous loci, with eight duplicated loci on the a <dig> and d <dig> chromosomes, seven on a <dig> and d <dig>  nine on a <dig> and d <dig> and three on a <dig> and d <dig> .

structure characterization of the newly updated linkage map
of the  <dig>  loci,  <dig> loci showed non-mendelian segregation  with  <dig> loci skewed toward tm- <dig> and  <dig> loci skewed toward the heterozygous state . of these distorted loci,  <dig> were in the at subgenome and  <dig> in the dt subgenome. these segregation-distorted loci were unevenly distributed and clustered in some regions of the  <dig> genetic linkage groups. a total of  <dig> segregation distortion regions  were detected on  <dig> linkage groups. there were two sdrs in the d <dig> linkage group . among  <dig> sdrs, six were on the at subgenome and six on the dt subgenome, with  <dig> sdrs skewed toward g. hirutum tm- <dig> and four sdrs skewed toward the heterozygote. sdr1_ <dig>  sdr5_ <dig> and sdr6_ <dig> were the three biggest sdrs and they all showed distortion toward the heterozygote .

the  <dig>  loci were not evenly distributed on the cotton chromosomes, with more loci on the dt-subgenome than the at-subgenome. to better understand the locus distribution on each chromosome, we analyzed the frequency of loci along  <dig> centimorgan  bins on the linkage map . most chromosomes had a similar marker density distribution, with the highest peak located near the center of linkage groups; furthermore, the a <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> linkage group each had two main peaks. the regions of high marker density in each chromosome indicated the presence of recombination suppression in these regions, which might be related to the heterochromatic regions  <cit> ; the main peaks on the each chromosome should cover the centromeric areas.

clusters of loci were also observed in  <dig> linkage groups, of which  <dig> clusters involved in  <dig> loci  that were discovered in  <dig> linkage groups besides a <dig> . of these,  <dig> clusters contained  <dig> loci from the at subgenome, and  <dig> clusters contained  <dig> loci from the dt subgenome. nineteen candidate gene islands  and one retrotransposon-rich region were discovered by cluster distribution of marker loci. for example, the cluster that spanned from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on a <dig>  contained six est-ssr markers that should have been a gene-rich region. the cluster composed of  <dig> loci  on d <dig>  may be a retrotransposon-rich region .

of  <dig>  loci, with the exception of aflp and srap,  <dig>   were from informative sequence-based markers. these highly informative sequence-based markers will be suitable for aligning the sequence information to linkage groups and finishing the integration between the dna sequences and the high-density genetic map in cotton.

integrating the genetic map with cotton dna sequence resources
a total of  <dig>  ests and  <dig> bacs from four major cotton species were extracted from the ncbi genbank database as a sequence reference pool, and  <dig>  sequence-based markers were used as probes to anchor and cluster these physical est and bac sequences by a highly specific in silico pcr-based method. as a result,  <dig>  primer pairs  successfully amplified dna fragments from  <dig>  ests and  <dig> bacs . at the same time, the chromosomal locations of  <dig> bacs were further confirmed by combining pcr-based in silico anchor results with pcr experimental amplification analysis according to the criteria described in the previous study  <cit> . the remaining  <dig>  primer pairs  did not amplify any dna products from the reference pool.

based on pcr in silico anchor results, we found that  <dig> bacs were anchored on both a- and d-genome homoelogous chromosomes;  <dig>  primer pairs amplified in silico dna sequences from four cotton species, with  <dig> primer pairs directing amplification of same-sized dna fragments, and  <dig>  primer pairs giving pcr products with different predicted sizes. these results showed higher-level sequence conservation and molecular size differences in orthologous and paralogous loci in the natural evolutionary process of different gossypium species.

to identify the genes corresponding to  <dig>  ests and  <dig> bacs,  <dig>  clusters were grouped and each est cluster was assembled into the longest possible unigene. for  <dig> bacs anchored to corresponding subgenome chromosomes, all genes in each bac were predicted based on ab initio method using the fgenesh program for further functional analysis. in total,  <dig>  candidate genes were mined for subsequent bioinformatics analysis .

functional annotation based on gene ontology
all candidate unigenes were subjected to homology analysis against ncbi the refseq plant protein database to obtain putative functional annotations using blastx with a cut-off e value set to 10- <dig>  of  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  sequences  had homology to protein sequences. among these,  <dig>  were matched known proteins, and  <dig> were unknown or hypothetical proteins . the remaining  <dig> sequences had no homologs in the plant refseq database and could be either 3â€² or 5â€² untranslated regions  of genes with very short coding regions, or they could represent novel genes  <cit> .

the e value distribution of the top-hits in the refseq database showed that  <dig> % of the mapped sequences had high homology , whereas  <dig> % ranged from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig> . likewise, the similarity distribution showed that  <dig> % of the sequences had a similarity higher than 50%, while  <dig> % of the hits had a similarity ranging from  <dig> % to 50% . through top-hit species distribution statistics, the majority of sequences were matched to the ricinus communis genome , followed by populus trichocarpa , vitis vinifera  and glycine max , which showed that a closer genetic relationship existed between them .

functional classification and pathway analysis
of  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   were mapped to the go hierarchy with characterized biochemical and physiological functions involving biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components . at a secondary level, the majority of the go terms were grouped into cellular process  and metabolic process  categories within biological processes, binding  and catalytic activity  categories within molecular functions, and cell , and organelle  categories within cellular components .

a comparison with the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database  showed that the metabolic-related enzymes encoded by  <dig> unigenes were located in metabolic maps based on the kegg pathway classification . most of the sequences localized to the metabolism category , followed by organismal systems , followed by the categories of environmental information processing , and genetic information processing ; the categories of cellular processes and human diseases were not found. in the category of metabolism, the mapped enzymes were mostly involved in carbohydrate metabolism , amino acid metabolism , and energy metabolism . in the category of organismal systems, all  <dig> mapped genes were attributed to the plant immune system classification. only eight genes were involved in signal transduction of environmental information processing .

integrating ests/genes with previously reported quantitative trait loci  related to fiber quality
of  <dig>  candidate genes,  <dig>  were mainly from the ests of developing fibers in gossypium. to further confirm the potential function of these genes in the fiber development process, integration analysis was performed between the ests/genes and previously reported cotton fiber quality quantitative trait loci   <cit> . as a result,  <dig> ests/genes related to fiber quality traits were integrated with  <dig> previously reported cotton fiber qtl. all integrated fiber quality qtl intervals had at least one est/gene, and some had several , which indicated the important roles in fiber quality of these genes. overall,  <dig> qtl were not randomly distributed across chromosomes, with  <dig> on the at subgenome involving  <dig> fiber quality-related ests/genes and  <dig> on the dt subgenome involving  <dig> fiber quality-related ests/genes. this indicated important ests/genes related to fiber quality existed in the dt subgenome in tetraploid cotton. on the d <dig> chromosome,  <dig> qtl associated with elite fiber quality were clustered in the chromosome region within a 40-cm interval; meanwhile,  <dig> fiber quality-related ests/genes were also detected in this region. a meta-analysis was further performed using biomercator software, both two qtl clusters simultaneously related to several fiber quality traits and the corresponding ests/genes involved in these qtl clusters were detected. some important genes, responsible for cotton fiber quality traits reported previously  <cit> , were found in the two qtl clusters region. for example, genes encoding cellulose synthase catalytic subunit and vacuolar hâ€‰+â€‰âˆ’translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase were found in the first qtl cluster region, and genes encoding fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein, sucrose synthase, and pectin acetyl esterase family protein were located in the second qtl cluster . this result indicated that these enriched ests/genes in these regions were important for improving cotton fiber quality, and should be studied in depth regarding their molecular function.

* the fiber quality traits mainly included fiber length , fiber strength , fiber fineness , fiber elongation , and fiber uniformity . qtl related to fiber quality traits were reported previously from references  <cit> .

discussion
a high-density genetic map is an important tool in cotton genomics research
high-density genetic maps have become an indispensible resource for elucidating genome structure, function and evolution, and are particularly important in polyploidy crops such as potato, cotton and wheat  <cit> . as the field of cotton structural genomics develops, the high-density genetic map will provide many important opportunities for mining information from important genes and qtl, implementing the integration of the genetic map with the physical map, and further building a solid foundation for cotton genome assembly and utilization.

in the present study, a high-density genetic map comprising  <dig>  loci was constructed. compared to our previously published map of  <dig>  loci  <cit> , this map increased by  <dig>  loci, with  <dig> new loci on the at subgenome and  <dig> new loci on the dt subgenome. previously, four genetic maps composed of more than two thousand loci in cotton have been reported  <cit> . compared to these four earlier high-density maps, our newly updated map has the most loci , the shortest distance between adjacent marker loci , and the fewest number of gaps . in addition, ours is a gene-rich linkage map with  <dig>  functional marker loci;  <dig> candidate genes islands, nine from the at subgenome and  <dig> from dt subgenome, were also discovered. considering the total map length, the updated map  is shorter than two previously published maps from rong et al.    <cit>  and yu et al.    <cit> , and it is slightly longer compared that the map of yu et al.    <cit> .

the development of new markers was very important for construction of the new high-density genetic map. retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphism  markers have been described in some plants  <cit> ; however, few reports have been published for cotton. retrotransposons are very prevalent in the cotton genome  <cit> . due to the accumulation of ltr retrotransposons, gossypium genome size has undergone a threefold increase over the 5â€“ <dig> mya since its origin  <cit> . thus, developing new markers related to retrotransposons will be important to define some regions of reduced recombination  of cotton chromosomes. here,  <dig> polymorphic loci from  <dig> remap markers were anchored on the new genetic map, and a retrotranposon-rich region was found to be clustered with eight remap loci on d <dig> . in the future, remap markers could be largely used to further enhance the saturation of cotton reference genetic maps in chromosomal heterochromatic regions.

segregation distortion regions are related to cotton evolution
segregation distortion is increasingly being recognized as a potentially powerful evolutionary force  <cit>  that may result from competition among gametes or from abortion of the gamete or zygote  <cit> . of the  <dig> loci on the new map that showed distorted segregation,  <dig>  were on the at subgenome, and only  <dig> loci  on the dt subgenome, even though more loci were tagged on the dt subgenome  than on the at subgenome  in the newly constructed high-density genetic map. thus, we speculate that the higher rate of polymorphism and the lower ratios of segregation in the dt subgenome of tetraploid cotton may be a result of nucleocytoplasmic interactions  <cit> . although more distorted loci were skewed toward the heterozygous allelic state than the homozygous state , the number of sdrs showing skewed transmission of g. hirsutum alleles exceeded the heterozygotes two-fold . one possible explanation was that g. hirsutum was the recurrent parent in our mapping population, and the pattern of transmission generally favored the elimination of the donor genotype, thus preserving the integrity of the recurrent genotype  <cit> .

integrating genetic and cytogenetic maps will accelerate elucidation of chromosome structure in cotton
from the genetic map, we observed that dna marker loci are distributed unevenly on the cotton chromosomes. heterochromatic regions in chromosomes are well known to inhibit crossover formation  <cit> . the clustering of a great number of markers corresponding to the centromeric regions was recognized and physically verified in maize  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . in cotton, the centromeres of chr.  <dig> and chr.  <dig> have been located on the cytogenetic map  <cit> . the marker loci bnl <dig>  nau <dig>  and nau <dig> from chr.  <dig> and bnl <dig>  nau <dig>  nau <dig>  and bnl <dig> from chr.  <dig> are near the centromeric regions of these two chromosomes, respectively. in the newly updated genetic map, these markers that are linked to the centromeric region are distributed in the main peaks, indicating that the main peaks encompass the centromeric regions of the two chromosomes. furthermore, in the newly updated genetic map, linkage groups a <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> had two main peaks, implying that there are two crossover suppression regions in each of these three chromosomes. wang et al.  distinguished the individual a-genome chromosomes by the bac-fish, and 45s rdna and 5s rdna probes gave hybridization signals on linkage groups a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  <cit> . the relationships between the rdna regions and the two main peaks on these chromosomes needs to be further examined.

toward assembling the allotetraploid cotton genome
tetraploid cotton  was derived from two diploids with a and d genomes that diverged from a common ancestor. the genus gossypium consists of at least  <dig> diploid and five allotetraploid species  <cit> . the evolution of cotton species has been significantly affected by polyploidization events  <cit> . during evolution, all diploid cotton species originated from a common ancestor 5â€“ <dig> million years ago, and all tetraploid cotton species originated 1â€“ <dig> million years ago. as a consequence of polyploidization, when genes are duplicated they may continue to evolve at the same rate as they did in their diploid ancestors, or they may be subject to selection pressures that lead to differential rates of sequence change  <cit> . ultimately, these duplicated sequences and their functions are maintained intact or undergo long-term evolutionary changes via sequence elimination  <cit> , sequence rearrangement  <cit> , gene silencing  <cit> , or acquisition of new function  <cit> . therefore, many paralogous loci, usually two homoeologous paralogous loci, one from the a-subgenome and another from the d-subgenome, occur as a result of polyploidization, with other paralogous loci arising from tandem duplications. significant polyploidization may complicate the assembly of cotton genome sequences, especially if they are accompanied by frequent illegitimate recombination events that render 'islands' of paralogous dna sequence  homogeneous  <cit> .

the high-density map described herein, and integration of cotton genomic data with genetically-mapped markers provides an excellent bridge to assemble cotton genome sequences accurately, fine map tagged qtl, and accomplish the confirmation of genes structure and function  <cit> . in this study, loci duplication, rearrangement and translocation were all detected by the analysis of duplicated loci. nevertheless, using a pcr-based computational method, a large number of cotton est and bac sequences were anchored to the cotton genetic map based on the available marker primer probes. in the bioinformatics analysis, we found that a tolerance of three mismatches in the alignments achieved a good balance between performance and accuracy. therefore, locus applicability could be greatly enhanced by identifying the corresponding gene functions. as a result,  <dig> ests/genes related to fiber quality traits were integrated with  <dig> previously reported cotton fiber quality qtl, with more on the d-subgenome than on the a-subgenome. this finding indicated that the d-subgenome from a non-fiber-production ancestor plays a large role in the genetic control of fiber growth and development in polyploid cotton. the ests/genes from the d-subgenome were important for improving cotton fiber quality, and these could be studied in depth to elucidate the relationship between ests/genes and qtl related to important fiber traits, further for the improvement of fiber quality in breeding purposes. the importance of the d-subgenome in lint fiber development has also been previously studied by a meta-analysis of polyploid cotton fiber qtl  <cit>  and a joint analysis of multiple backcross generations  <cit> .

the  <dig>  previously-mapped independent markers were successfully matched to est sequences and bac clones from different cotton species or the two subgenomes in tetraploid cotton species. furthermore, we detected higher-level evolutionary sequence conservation in the different gossypium species, as well as sequence size differences of paralogous and orthologous loci in the natural evolutionary process of genus gossypium. the integrated physical sequences and the genetic map provide us with valuable resources for comparative genomics of different cotton species, for distinguishing the two different subgenomes from one another, and for ultimately elucidating the genomic determinants of phenotypic diversity between cotton species that evolved within the last 5â€“ <dig> mya.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the construction of a high-density linkage map provides an essential resource to facilitate the correct ordering of dna segments on chromosomes for the comprehensive and accurate assembly of the allotetraploid cotton genome, and will enable further clarification of genome organization changes revealed by multiple species comparisons. the future availability of whole-genome sequences from cotton species will provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to analyze features of genome organization at the dna sequence level, to study differences between organisms by comparing whole genomic sequences, and to enhance our understanding of the functional and agronomic significance of polyploidy and genome size variation in gossypium.
