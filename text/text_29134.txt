BACKGROUND
lantibiotics are gene-encoded, ribosomally-synthesized antimicrobial peptides which are distinguishable by the presence of unusual amino acids including lanthionine , β-methyl-lanthionine  and a number of dehydrated amino acids . these unusual amino acids are formed as a result of post-translational modifications of precursor peptides; for example, serine and threonine residues are enzymatically dehydrated to give dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, respectively. a cysteine residue can then react with one of the newly formed unsaturated sites in what is essentially a  <dig> -michael addition reaction to form the characteristic thioether amino acids lan and melan. lantibiotics are synthesized as precursor peptides containing n terminal extensions or leader peptides which are removed during export through a dedicated bacteriocin transport system leading to the active mature peptide.

lantibiotics are currently classified into eleven subgroups based on alignments of the unmodified structural peptides . two of these groups contain the individual components of a number of two component lantibiotics i.e. those lantibiotics which display enhanced bactericidal effects due to the complementary activity of two peptides. to date, seven two component lantibiotics have been identified and include lacticin  <dig>  <cit> , staphylococcin c <dig>  <cit> , plantaricin w  <cit> , cytolysin  <cit> , haloduracin  <cit> , smb  <cit>  and bht-a  <cit> . of these, cytolysin is clearly the most distant relative based on homologies and biological activity, while lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> peptides are particularly closely related. staphylococcin c <dig> is produced by staphylococcus aureus c <dig>  the adopted prototype of phage ii bacteriocin producers  and indeed, is widely produced by this group of s. aureus strains  <cit> . its genetic determinants are located on a  <dig> kb plasmid in the strain s. aureus c <dig>  <cit>  but have also been identified on a  <dig> kb plasmid in s. aureus u <dig>  and on a  <dig> kb petb plasmid from the clinical isolate s. aureus ty <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, in all cases, the bacteriocin structural genes are closely associated with an exfoliative toxin b determinant, an exotoxin associated with skin infections in humans  <cit> . the structural peptides, staphylococcin c55α and c55β of molecular masses  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, are both required in equimolar amounts to act synergistically to give an antimicrobial effect against s. aureus, micrococcus luteus but not s. epidermidis strains  <cit> . mode of action studies indicated that cell death was due to pore formation in the cytoplasmic membrane and widespread inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis following exposure to the partially purified material .

in contrast, lacticin  <dig> is produced by a food-grade l. lactis subsp. lactis dpc <dig> strain and encoded on a  <dig>  kb conjugative plasmid pmrc <dig> which encodes the genetic determinants for production and immunity  <cit> . the two structural peptides of lacticin  <dig> are ltna <dig> and ltna <dig> with molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the optimal ratio of the two lacticin peptides has recently been established, suggesting a peptide stoichiometry of 1: <dig>  effective at nanomolar concentrations   <cit> . lacticin ltna <dig> does exhibit independent inhibitory activity which is greatly enhanced by the presence of the ltna <dig> peptide. sequential addition studies show that the ltna <dig> peptide must be added before ltna <dig> to observe inhibitory activity  <cit> . this activity, which occurs at nanomolar concentrations for the lacticin peptides, suggests the involvement of a docking molecule speculated to be lipid ii as is the case with nisin  <cit> . in addition, lipid ii has been identified as the target molecule for a number of other antimicrobial peptides including mersacidin and actagardin  <cit> . interestingly, the 3d structure of lacticin  <dig> has recently been elucidated  <cit>  and reveals a specific lanthionine-bridging pattern in ltna <dig> closely resembling that of the lipid ii-binding globular lantibiotic mersacidin which acts by inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis. in contrast, the ltna <dig> peptide has a more elongated linear structure potentially capable of pore formation. it is speculated that the lacticin peptides display a dual mode of action similar to nisin, however in the case of lacticin  <dig> both functions are assigned to separate peptides  <cit> . in essence, it is predicted that ltna <dig> binds to lipid ii in a similar way to mersacidin, thereby inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis through the prevention of transglycosylation. the second function of pore formation and rapid efflux of k+ and phosphate ions  <cit>  is assigned to the linear more hydrophobic peptide ltna <dig>  weidemann et al.  <cit>  recently provided some experimental evidence that agreed with this speculation.

the focus of this communication was to investigate the similarities and differences between lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig>  primary sequence analysis of the prepeptides suggests that lacticin a <dig> and staphylococcin c55α resemble natural variants with a difference of only  <dig> amino acids between the two peptides, while the complementary peptides share less identity . we demonstrate that purified peptides of the two bacteriocins can cross complement with negligible losses in activity, and that the post translational machinery of ltna <dig> can produce a viable c55α peptide. furthermore substitution of leucine  <dig> of ltna <dig>  located within a proposed lipid ii binding pocket, for the corresponding alanine residue in c55α counterpart, was not produced.

RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis
lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> are closely related two component lantibiotics. ltna <dig> and c55α share 86% identity with a difference of only  <dig> amino acids in the unmodified propeptide whereas ltna <dig> and c55β share less identity  with highest homology spanning a  <dig> amino acid region at the c terminal end of the propeptides . thus, it is not surprising that the predicted structure of c55α very closely resembles that which has been established for ltna <dig>   <cit> . in addition to the structural peptides the proposed modification and transport proteins exhibit significant homology. for example, the lacticin modification peptides lacticin ltnm <dig> and ltnm <dig> share  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity to their staphylococcin counterparts sacm <dig> and sacm <dig>  respectively. in addition, the transport peptides lacticin ltnt and staphylococcin sact are  <dig> % identical, while lacticin ltnj and staphylococcin sacj  share 47% identity. a clustal w alignment demonstrating the evolutionary divergence across the structural peptides of lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> indicated that the number of substitution events between ltna <dig> and c55α was considerably lower at  <dig>  in comparison to  <dig> for ltna <dig> and c55β . in contrast, investigation of the evolutionary divergence between the modification peptides ltnm <dig> with sacm <dig> and ltnm <dig> with sacm <dig> indicated values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while the transport peptides were slightly more conserved with a value of  <dig>  for ltnt and sact. these results indicate that the lanthionine containing peptides ltna <dig> and c55α had a slow rate of divergence relative to the biosynthesis machinery and are highly conserved. indeed, the amino acid identity and evolutionary divergence across both two component lantibiotics is indicative of a common ancestor.

purified preparation of staphylococcin c <dig> displays a broad spectrum of inhibition analogous to lacticin 3147
initially, the range of inhibitory activity of l. lactis dpc <dig> and s. aureus c <dig> against a number of indicator strains was examined . the strain s. aureus c <dig> inhibited l. lactis strains and m. luteus but failed to inhibit enterococcus, mastitic s. aureus, listeria, bacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus or escherichia coli. however, all of these strains with the exception of pediococcus and the gram-negative e. coli strain were inhibited by a concentrated preparation of the staphylococcin c <dig> peptides. the l. lactis dpc <dig> culture inhibited all strains listed with the exception of the s. aureus strains and e. coli. however, when the concentrated supernatant of lacticin  <dig> was assayed it was found to inhibit the full list of gram-positive indicator strains used . overall, this demonstrates that both bacteriocins are active against a wide range of gram-positive strains.

cross complementation between lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> evident at a nanomolar range
the synergistic effect of staphylococcin peptides c55α and c55β and the lacticin  <dig> peptides ltna <dig> and ltna <dig> against the indicator strain l. lactis hp is clearly shown by the well diffusion assay technique . when the lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> peptides were cross combined, complementation was observed. for instance, when ltna <dig> and c55β were combined, a zone of inhibition against the sensitive indicator strain l. lactis hp was evident . indeed, the combination of c55α and ltna <dig> also appeared to exhibit cross synergism to the level of activity presented by both parent strains . this cross complementation which was evident between the two strains was further examined by microtitre plate assays using purified preparations of both peptides and is presented as isobolograms . the mic <dig> for the lacticin peptides was in the single-nanomolar range; i.e.  <dig> nm of ltna <dig> titrated against  <dig> nm of ltna <dig> inhibited the growth of the indicator l. lactis hp by 50%, as similarly reported by morgan et al.,  . likewise, combinations of staphylococcin c <dig> peptides also displayed inhibitory activity in the singular nanomolar range  at a peptide stoichiometry of 1: <dig> . similarly, hybrid pairs of the bacteriocins, ltna <dig> with c55β  and c55α with ltna <dig> , displayed a high specific activity of 4: <dig> nm and 8: <dig> nm, respectively. overall, the level of inhibition across the four combinations was in the nanomolar range.

effect of swapping structural genes
the ltna <dig> and ltna <dig> genes in the large conjugative plasmid pmrc <dig> were precisely replaced with the staphylococcin c <dig> structural genes sacαa and sacβa using a strategy involving amplification and spliced overlap extension  pcr  <cit>  . this construct inhibited the indicator strain l. lactis hp, albeit the inhibitory activity was significantly reduced . the supernatant of mutant a was purified  and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the structural peptide c55β was not produced whereas a mass corresponding to c55α was evident. when the purified hplc fraction putatively containing c55α was combined with pure peptides of either ltna <dig> or c55β the activity was greatly enhanced. this demonstrated that the modification and transport machinery of lacticin  <dig> could modify and export the c55α peptide resulting in an extracellular mature active peptide. notably, no complementation effect was seen when hplc fractions were combined with either ltna <dig> or c55α, supporting the mass spectrometry finding that c55β was not produced. it was thought possible that heterologous production of c55α and c55β could be enhanced through fusion of the corresponding ltna <dig> and ltna <dig> leaders, respectively,  if it aided recognition of the peptides by the lacticin  <dig> biosynthetic machinery.

thus the leader of ltna <dig> was fused by soeing to the c55α propeptide segment of the structural gene generating an ltna1/sacα hybrid  and the leader of ltna <dig> was fused to the propeptide segment of the structural gene of c55β generating an ltna2/sacβ hybrid . purified preparations  from both hybrid bacteriocins produced a zone of inhibition against the indicator strain l. lactis hp, however, the activity was significantly reduced with respect to the parent strains. the reduced zone of inhibition was attributed to a concentrated level of one peptide alone, either ltna <dig>  or ltna <dig> . following hplc purification, neither hybrid peptide could be detected by mass spectrometry analysis. notably, no complementation effect was seen when hplc fractions of ltna1/sacα hybrid were combined with either ltna <dig> or c55β  and similarly no complementation effect was seen when hplc fractions of ltna2/sacβ hybrid were combined with either ltna <dig> or c55α, supporting the mass spectrometry finding that the hybrid peptides were not produced. these results indicate that while the lacticin biosynthesis machinery can produce the active mature peptide c55α, it cannot produce either of the hybrid bacteriocins where ltn leaders are used in attempt to enhance the generation of active mature processed c <dig> peptides.

site-directed mutagenesis reveal that residue l <dig> is essential for ltna <dig> production
site-directed mutagenesis of ltna <dig> was carried out in order to assess the biological significance of changing any of the  <dig> amino acids in ltna <dig>  to their staphylococcin c <dig> counterparts. several attempts to generate an a27s mutant failed. however, mutants n15k, a17n and l21a were introduced into the genes for the prepeptides. therefore n15k, a17n amd l21a mutant peptides were successfully engineered. while concentrated preparations  of n15k and a17n supernatants retained high activity  the amino acid change of leucine to an alanine at position  <dig>  which is in the putative lipid ii binding region completely abolished the inhibitory capacity of the corresponding strain  . notably, when the purified preparation  of l21a was combined with ltna <dig> peptide a complementation effect was evident confirming the mass spectrometry finding that ltna <dig> was produced. on the other hand, when l21a was combined with ltna <dig> peptide no complementation effect was evident supporting the mass spectrometry result that the ltna <dig> mutant was not produced. in this case, a reduced zone of inhibition was evident; however, this was due to the presence of concentrated ltna <dig> peptide alone. in fact it would appear that an ltna <dig> derivative is not produced by this strain suggesting that the lacticin  <dig> biosynthetic machinery could not tolerate this change. this is further evidence of a difference in the processing machinery of lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig>  given that the sacm <dig> modification enzyme tolerates the presence of an alanine at position  <dig> in c55α.

CONCLUSIONS
l. lactis dpc <dig> and s. aureus c <dig> contain plasmids which encode highly similar two component lantibiotics. indeed, evolutionary divergence and amino acid identity across the two lantibiotics confirm a common ancestor. the structural genes for the ltna <dig> and c55α peptides have diverged to a much lesser extent than their associated modification and processing machinery, indicating a high degree of conservation between sequence, structure and function in these peptides, almost certainly imposed by the role of these peptides in mediating binding to a highly conserved target in lipid ii and subsequently promoting interaction with their ltna2/c55β partner peptides. it is interesting to note in this respect that the leader regions do diverge to the extent which would be predicted by the divergent modification genes. in contrast, far less conservation is required for the α-helical section of the ltna2/c55β peptides, where it is envisaged that amphiphatic conservative changes would not negatively affect the overall function of the peptide in pore formation. in addition, the difference in inhibitory spectra for both strains is negligible, both inhibiting a wide range of gram-positive bacteria. when combinations of purified peptides were assayed, for example, ltna <dig> with c55β and c55α with ltna <dig>  they display a cross synergistic effect against the indicator strain l. lactis hp. in addition to this cross complementation between the lantibiotics, their specific activity was in the singular nanomolar range. this finding suggests that both lantibiotics use the lipid ii target, despite differences in their lipid ii binding pocket. it is not surprising that ltna <dig> and c55α can be interchangeable as they share 86% identity while on the other hand, ltna <dig> and c55β only share 55% identity. nonetheless, when ltna <dig> and c55β were exchanged for each other no loss of activity was observed. this suggests that the region responsible for peptide:peptide  interaction spans the  <dig> amino acid region at the c terminus of both peptides , while the more permissive n-terminus is responsible for membrane insertion and pore formation. while these results are obviously of interest with respect to lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> in particular, there are a number of broader implications. this is the first occasion upon which it has been demonstrated that the individual components of any sort of two-component bacteriocin, be they lantibiotics or non-lantibiotics, are interchangeable. it would also indicate that one could take advantage of the fact that functional domains are separated across two peptides. theoretically a1/α and a2/β from different sources could be combined with a view to identifying pairs that have more potent activity against a particular target organism.

interestingly, at a molecular level, the lacticin 3147-biosynthetic machinery was capable of producing the lanthionine containing c55α peptide when preceded by the staphylococcin c55α leader. to our knowledge this is the first occasion upon which an active  lanthionine-containing peptide has been produced from its own gene by biosynthetic machinery other than its own, without some manipulation of its leader region. previously it was established that processed, albeit inactive, nisin could only be produced by the subtilin biosynthetic machinery if a nisin-subtilin chimera containing the subtilin leader was first generated  <cit> . it is thus surprising that when the c <dig> leader was precisely replaced with the lacticin ltna <dig> leader  production of c55α was eliminated rather than improved . it was previously established that processing of lacticin  <dig> by lctm occurred independently of the first  <dig> n-terminally located residues of the lcta leader  <cit> . significantly, although the ltna <dig> and c55α leaders are only 48% identical, they are 74% identical with respect to the  <dig> c-terminally located residues. this identity is likely to be responsible for successful biosynthesis and production by the lacticin  <dig> machinery. it may also mean that one or more of the five residue differences within this region could explain the negative impact of the ltna <dig> leader. thus, in this instance at least, the leader appears to be specific to the peptide that it exports rather than to the biosynthetic machinery. with respect to c55β it is not surprising, given the relatively lower levels of homology with ltna <dig> both within the structural and leader regions, that heterologous production was not successful.

mature ltna <dig> differs from c55α with respect to at least four residues. there is, however, some ambiguity with respect to the identity of the amino acid at position  <dig> of c55α. it may be that this residue is a d-alanine, as is the case for ltna <dig>  rather than the dha reported previously  <cit> . this suggestion is based on the fact that amino acid analysis predicts the presence of three alanines in the mature form of c55α  and that the c <dig> operon contains an ltnj homolog  <cit> . with respect to the four confirmed differences site directed mutagenesis was employed to convert the individual amino acids of ltna <dig> into its c <dig> counterpart where three out of the four mutants were successfully created. interestingly, it was found that an exchange of leucine  <dig> for alanine abolished peptide production of the associated mutant peptide. it is noteworthy that a corresponding leucine is also found in a number of other lantibiotics within the same subgroup as ltna <dig> i.e. mersacidin  <cit> , actagardine  <cit> , and plantaricin w  <cit> . alignments of closely related globular peptides show that residues surrounding this leucine are highly conserved and in the case of mersacidin are found to be involved in lipid ii binding  <cit> . in contrast, the site directed mutants of n15k and a17n tolerated change and the peptides were highly active. it may be that the presence of an alanine at position  <dig> of these peptides is only successful if complementary residues are located at positions  <dig>   <dig> and/or  <dig>  it will be interesting to determine in the future whether it is possible to restore production/activity of the ltna1-l21a mutant through the introduction of compensatory mutations.

we have thus established that because of their two component nature it is possible to combine the attributes of two lantibiotics such as lacticin  <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> in vitro to produce new antimicrobials. should it prove possible to build on these successes a great number of two-component mixtures, limited only by the number of two-component lantibiotics present in nature, would be possible. it is very interesting that such remarkably similar systems ended up in dissimilar organisms.
