BACKGROUND
the genus pyrus l. belongs to the tribe pyreae baill.  of the family rosaceae  <cit>  and is geographically divided into two groups: occidental pears and oriental pears  <cit> . the majority of oriental pears are native to china; a few are native to japan and the korean peninsula. chinese taxonomists agreed on  <dig> pyrus species native to china, among which p. betulaefolia bge. and p. calleryana dcne. have retained characteristics believed to be ancestral for pyrus  <cit>  including the smallest fruit size and lowest carpel number. based on morphological traits or crossing experiments, p. × bretschneideri rehd., p. × serrulata rehd., p. × sinkiangensis yu, and p. × hopeiensis yu are putative hybrids among other pyrus species  <cit> . the circumscription of species, subspecies, and forms for occidental species remains controversial. it is believed that some cultivated pears frequently escaped from cultivation and became feral. these plants hybridize easily, both with cultivated and wild species, resulting in a number of intermediate forms and segregants  <cit> . therefore, morphological characters are poor indicators of pyrus phylogeny. other data sources, like chemical characters, were used to distinguish some pear species  <cit> , but these were plagued by low number of characters, polymorphisms, and environmental plasticity. during the last decade, molecular markers including rflps  <cit> , rapds  <cit> , genomic-ssrs  <cit> , est-ssrs  <cit>  and aflps  <cit>  have been applied in pyrus. these data provided useful information on the origin of some cultivated pear groups, e.g. chinese white pears , which are assigned to p. × bretschneideri. however, cwp are morphologically different from the so-called wild p. × bretschneideri in northern hebei province  <cit> . they also show a close relationship to p. pyrifolia based on multiple molecular marker data and thus were treated as p. pyrifolia white pear group  <cit> . however, most of the studies have focused on the relationships of several oriental or occidental species or cultivar pear groups, and the phylogeny of the genus remains unresolved.

plastid dna sequence data and the internal transcribed spacer  of nuclear ribosomal dna  have been used for plant phylogenetic reconstruction due to ease of amplification. in the rosaceae, these data have been applied in phylogenetic studies at different taxonomic levels  <cit> , but their utility is limited due to varied evolutionary rates  <cit> . intra-individual its polymorphisms caused by incomplete concerted evolution of nrdna arrays have been found in many rosaceae  <cit> . such polymorphisms provided evidence for hybrid origins of some species in rosa  <cit> , but they led to a poorly resolved phylogeny in malus  <cit> . similarly, our previous study in pyrus  <cit>  revealed a history of non-concerted evolution of its and a poorly resolved phylogenetic tree. six non-coding regions of plastid dna were found to be highly conserved in pyrus  <cit> , but they reflect only the maternal genealogies.

an alternative source of molecular sequence data, low-copy nuclear genes , has proven to be more phylogenetically informative than either its or plastid dna  <cit> . these genes reflect biparental lineages and are less prone to homogenization  <cit> . due to the accumulation of large number of gene sequences in genbank, it is now possible to design taxa-specific primers. however, paralog and lineage sorting problems are still challenges to applying lcngs to phylogenetic studies, since they may lead to topological incongruence similar to those caused by hybridization  <cit> . gene duplication is a prominent feature of plant genome evolution, and duplicate segments account for 60% of the arabidopsis thaliana genome  <cit> . in molecular phylogenetic studies, nuclear genes undergoing gene duplications or the birth-and-death process lead to problems in the identification of orthologs and paralogs and discordance between gene and species trees. additionally, frequent gene duplications made the terms 'paralogy' and 'orthology' ambiguous. thus the new terms 'inparalog' for paralogs that evolved after the ingroup speciation and 'outparalog' for those that evolved before ingroup speciation occurred  <cit> . lineage sorting  results from random fixation of ancestral polymorphic alleles, which may induce similar topological incongruence to that of hybridization, and poses the most challenging problems for inter- and intra-specific phylogenetic inference  <cit> . however, lineage sorting is a random process, and fixation of ancestral alleles among species is rarely identical for two unlinked nuclear loci. therefore, incongruence caused by hybridization and lineage sorting could be differentiated when comparing phylogenies based on multiple unlinked nuclear loci.

lcngs that succeeded in other rosaceae are potentially ideal nuclear markers for phylogenetic studies of pyrus. the coding region of gbssi has been successfully applied at intergeneric and higher levels  <cit> , but the introns are too short and dispersed to be ideal gene regions for interspecific levels studies. another gene region is the second intron of leafy, which is long enough and has been proven to be informative for studies at the interspecific level in pyreae  <cit> . complete coding sequences of two leafy loci have been isolated in pyrus  <cit> , and the corresponding genomic sequences in malus species are available . thus obtaining introns of leafy in the pyrus taxa is possible.

alcohol dehydrogenase gene  is one of the best-studied nuclear-encoded genes in plants. two major adh classes, class p with alcohol activity and class iii with glutathione-dependent formaldehyde activity, have been identified in flowering dicot or monocot plants. the former is common for plants and the latter has been isolated in a few taxa including pisum sativum   <cit> , oryza sativa  and araobidopsis thaliana   <cit> . the adh gene occurs in small gene families, and has proven to be a useful phylogenetic marker in the poaceae and paeoniaceae  <cit> , but it is too complex a gene family or provided little phylogenetic resolution in other taxa such as the gossypium and carex  <cit> . two distinct adh loci  have been isolated in p. communis 'packham's triumph'  <cit> , thus it is possible to isolate adh genes among pyrus species. however, the only genomic adh sequence from a species of rosaceae is that from fragaria ananassa  in genbank  <cit> , and the exon/intron structure is unknown in pyrus. the phylogenetic utility of adh coding regions and the intron region have not been determined in any rosaceae taxa.

since no lcng analysis had been applied to phylogenetic studies of pyrus, we explored the utility of leafy and adh. in this study, a comparison of genomic and rt-pcr-based approaches yielded an initial description of the composition and functionality of the adh gene family in pyrus. the phylogenetic utility of adh gene regions and the second intron of leafy were determined after examining the sequence divergence, gene duplications, lineage sorting and recombination.

malus taxa were once assigned to pyrus, but miller treated malus mill. as a separate genus in  <dig> due to graft incompatibility between the two  <cit> . malus taxa originated before pyrus taxa according to the fossil occurrence  <cit> , and are here used as outgroups .

RESULTS
gene structure and paralog identification based on long adh sequences
a total of  <dig> adh <dig> and eight adh <dig> long partial sequences were obtained by genomic-pcr  using different primer sets  in 'cuiguan' , 'nanguoli' , 'korlaxiangli' , 'flemish beauty' , m. rockii, m. domestica subsp. chinensis and 'ralls' . all of these adh genes encoded medium-chain adh enzymes with  <dig> amino acid residues. after phylogenetic analyses, gene structure and sequence divergence comparisons, two paralogs representing adh <dig>  and adh <dig>  were identified.

as shown in figure  <dig>  adh2- <dig> had a classical adh gene structure with nine introns similar to zea mays, fragaria ananassa, and other characterized plant adh genes  <cit> . exon and intron codes described in this study were named following the classical gene structure to avoid confusion. adh2- <dig> had lost intron  <dig>  while both adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig> had lost intron  <dig>  adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig> have the same gene structure, but the former was obtained by downstream primer adh1-r <dig> located in the 3'utr region, while the latter was obtained only by downstream adh1-r <dig> located in the last exon . this indicates that the 3' utr region of adh1- <dig> may be divergent from that of adh1- <dig>  however, we were unable to obtain the 3'utr region of adh1- <dig>  adh1- <dig> obtained in 'cuiguan'  displayed a 20-bp deletion in exon  <dig>  one of the three adh1- <dig> clones in 'korlaxiangli'  and one of the three adh1- <dig> clones in 'ralls'  displayed one or two 1-bp deletions, respectively, in exonic regions. a stop codon occurred in the exonic region in one of the two adh2- <dig> sequences of m. rockii. these sequences were deemed putative pseudogenes and were removed from subsequent sequence analyses.

among these four adh paralogs , only the intron regions of adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig> could be aligned. therefore, only the coding regions were used for nucleotide sequence divergence  and amino acid sequence divergence  comparisons. as shown in table  <dig> nsd between adh <dig> and adh <dig> paralogs was as high as  <dig> , while that within each paralog was lower than  <dig> . nsd between adh2- <dig> and adh2- <dig>  was much greater than that between adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig> . nsd of adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig> between pyrus and malus were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. all of these sequence divergence comparisons were consistent with the consequent phylogenetic inferences, indicating that our identification of paralogs was accurate. in most cases, nsd was greater than asd between different homologs, while nsd was less than asd within each homolog.

both maximum parsimony   and neighbor joining   trees based on amino acid sequences of adh genes from different plant taxa displayed similar topologies. class iii adh formed clades separate from the putative class p adh. the adh genes from the solanaceae, brassicaceae, anacardiaceae, and fabaceae were monophyletic with high bootstrap values, suggesting that duplication events leading to these adh genes occurred independently after diversification of these plant families. the adh genes from paeoniaceae and poaceae also formed monophyletic clades; however, with low bootstrap values. different adh genes in malus and pyrus  were not monophyletic. adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig> in malus and pyrus formed two sister clades with fragaria ananassa as their sister clade, suggesting that gene duplication leading to these two outparalogs occurred prior to diversification of malus and pyrus. adh2- <dig> and adh2- <dig> in malus and pyrus formed another clade. due to lack of related sequences in other rosaceae taxa, we cannot infer their origin. among investigated families, fabaceae is the most closely related to rosaceae, but their adh genes did not show a close relationship, indicating that the adh genes have become highly diversified within each family.

phylogenetic analyses based on reduced adh <dig> sequences
only a short region containing intron  <dig> and intron  <dig> of adh <dig>  were sequenced from more pyrus species to investigate the phylogenetic utility of this region. adh1- <dig> was preferentially amplified and only two adh1- <dig> sequences were obtained in p. amygaliformis and 'dangshansuli' . three subparalogs, adh1-1a, adh1-1b, adh1-1c, were supported by the tree topologies . these were outparalogs that occurred before malus and pyrus diversification. only adh1-1c was obtained in all pyrus accessions, while all of the three adh1- <dig> outparalogs were derived in the same nine accessions. multiple intra-individual polymorphic sequences representing one adh1- <dig> outparalog could be recovered in some individuals. for example, five adh1-1c sequences of p. × hopeiensis displaying autapomorphic mutations were monophyletic in the tree, but only one sequence was retained in the final dataset. based on our previous experience, such small mutations were more probably caused by taq polymerase errors during cloning and pcr. among these subparalogs, the length of intron  <dig> varied from  <dig> to  <dig> bp while that of intron  <dig> varied from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and subparalog associated indels were observed . a string of thymine residues from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp among adh1-1c copies made alignment difficult, thus this region was removed from phylogenetic analyses. two sequences possessing characteristics  of different adh1- <dig> outparalogs were identified as recombinants by recombination detection program   <cit> , and  <dig> more similar putative recombinants were identified manually by observing their conflicting positions within the alignment. these putative recombinants were probably artificial products created during pcr and were excluded from all analyses.

the final dataset contained  <dig> adh1- <dig> and six adh1- <dig> copies with an aligned length of  <dig> bp. the nsd within each adh1- <dig> subparalog was very low, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   . adh1- <dig> from 'ralls'  was selected as the outgroup for phylogenetic analyses. mp  and bayesian analyses  of this dataset resulted in similar phylogenetic trees with little difference in support values . adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig> formed two separate clades. within the adh1- <dig> clade, adh1-1a and adh1-1b were closely related and formed a sister clade to adh1-1c. adh1-1c was obtained in all accessions, but the relationships were poorly resolved with extensive polytomies. the occidental species, p. communis, p. amygdaliformis, p. elaeagrifolia and p. cossonii, were not monophyletic. most intra-individual polymorphic sequences were polyphyletic, e.g. p. calleryana, p. xerophila, 'nijisseiki'  and 'korlaxiangli' . adh1-a and adh1-b were only obtained in some accessions, thus the phylogenetic relationships in these two clades were incomplete, but the occidental species were monophyletic in both clades.

transcription of adh homologs
specific genomic pcr  and rt-pcr using locus specific primers produced expected bands in the genomic dna and cdna samples. both adh <dig> and adh <dig> were transcribed in all investigated tissues and cultivars . to investigate the transcription of different adh homologs, phylogenetic analyses including sequences derived from sg-pcr, g-pcr and rt-pcr were conducted for adh <dig> and adh <dig> separately, and the putative pseudogenes identified above were also included to enhance the findings on functionality of adh homologs.

as indicated in additional file  <dig> the transcription of an adh1- <dig> copy was not observed. we speculate that adh1- <dig> is a nonfunctional outparalog, since putative pseudogenes have been identified and its 3'utr region is divergent from adh1- <dig> as described above. among the adh1- <dig> outparalogs the most frequently cloned adh1-1c was not recovered by rt-pcr, indicating that it was a degenerate outparalog. this also explains its preferential amplification. transcription of the other adh1- <dig> outparalogs was detected among different tissues or cultivars. transcription of adh2- <dig> could be detected in all investigated tissues and cultivars. an adh2- <dig> sequence was not obtained in the three malus accessions by g-pcr, but its transcription was found in 'fuji'  . adh2- <dig> was only observed in malus taxa, and transcription of this paralog was not detected. we could not deduce distinct tissue-specific or cultivar-specific expression for either adh1- <dig> or adh2- <dig>  several anomalous adh2- <dig> copies with only intron  <dig> were recovered by cloning of rt-pcr products in 'flemish beauty'  and 'nanguoli'  . since intron-containing cdna has not been reported, those copies may be amplified due to genomic dna contamination and indicate existence of an additional adh <dig> paralog with more intron loss in pyrus.

sequence variation and paralogs of leafy
twenty-six lfy <dig> and  <dig> lfy <dig> sequences including a partial exon  <dig> were obtained. four groups with different length variations in the exon region were observed: lfy1-malus , lfy1-pyrus , lfy2-malus  and lfy2-pyrus , which were congruent with those from rt-pcr in p. pyrifolia 'housui'  and m. domestica 'fuji' , respectively. the length of these indels only had an effect on the length of the deduced amino acid sequences. among pyrus accessions, nsd of this partial exon  <dig> between lfy <dig> and lfy <dig> was relatively high , while that within lfy <dig> and lfy <dig> was low at  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .

the entire intron  <dig> of lfy <dig> among pyrus species ranged from 774- <dig> bp, while that of lfy <dig> ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. lfy1int <dig> and lfy2int <dig> were amplified in all accessions using specific primers, but lfy2int <dig> of m. rockii and m. domestica subsp. chinensis were amplified by another forward primer mlfy2-f  due to a large deletion  in these two accessions. lfy2int <dig> of all malus accessions contained a 211-bp insertion, which made alignment difficult and was removed from the analyses. nsd within lfy1int <dig> and lfy2int <dig> among pyrus accessions was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively , while that between malus and pyrus was much higher at  <dig>  for lfy1int <dig> and  <dig>  for lfy2int <dig> .

sequence variation and phylogenetic analyses of lfy1int <dig> suggest two subparalogs, lfy1int2-a and lfy1int2-b, among pyrus species. compared with lfy1int2-a, lfy1int2-b contains a 6-bp insertion. recovery of lfy1int2-a and lfy1int2-b in each accession is shown in table  <dig>  among oriental species, nsd within lfy1int2-a was lower than that within lfy1int2-b for both orf regions  and intron regions . between lfy1int2-a and lfy1int2-b, nsd was  <dig>  for the orf region and  <dig>  in for the intron region. for lfy2int <dig>  subparalogs with an 8-bp insertion  and 2-bp deletion  were only recovered in a few accessions. the common lfy2int2-n, with no indel, was recovered in all accessions but 'yali'  . coexistence of these subparalogs in one individual could be detected by direct sequencing due to the fixed position of indels. a minimum of three clones were sequenced. it was found that pcr or direct sequencing sometimes did not reflect the subparalogs existing in one genome, probably due to amplification preference of different nuclear alleles. for example, direct sequencing of lfy2int <dig> in p. calleryana identified lfy2int2-n, but a lfy2int2-del <dig> sequence was obtained by cloning.

several anomalous lfy2int <dig> copies were exclusively found in particular accessions. lfy2int <dig> from p. communis had a 21-bp deletion. lfy2int <dig> from p. fauriei had a 525-bp insertion that was partially homologous  to the noncoding region of the s-rnase gene , and was named lfy2int2-s. to eliminate the possibility of genetic recombination during pcr, all accessions were tested with an insert-specific upstream forward primer 'lfy2s-f'  and the reverse primer lfy2-r. as a result, the lfy2int2-s was detected in 'yali' , 'jianbali' , and 'yaguang' , but the sequences were not included in the phylogenetic analyses. lfy2int2-s in p. fauriei was still included in the dataset after the exclusion of its large insertion.

phylogenetic analyses of lfy1int <dig> and lfy2int2
malus sieboldii and m. domestica  without the 220-bp deletion in lfy2int <dig> were used as outgroups in phylogenetic analyses of lfy1int <dig> and lfy2int <dig>  putative recombinants were identified by rdp or by investigating abnormal substitution patterns and ambiguous alignment positions. the putative recombinants displayed unique substitutions of sequences from two distinct subclades and always formed well-separated clades in the tree, thus they were excluded from the final analyses . a total of  <dig> lfy1int <dig>  and  <dig> lfy2int <dig>  sequences were included in two separate datasets. excluding sequences from malus, the lfy1int <dig> dataset had an aligned length of  <dig> sites, of which  <dig>  were parsimony informative, while lfy2int <dig> had an aligned length of  <dig> sites and  <dig>  were parsimony informative . similarly, only bayesian trees were shown for both lfy1int <dig> and lfy2int <dig> datasets.

as shown in figure  <dig>  lfy1int2-a formed a monophyletic clade. the relationships within this clade were largely unresolved; however, close relationships among p. × serrulata, p. calleryana and 'yali'  were resolved with high bootstrap support. most of the subclades of lfy1int2-b were unresolved polytomies sister to lfy1int2-a. the occidental species were not monophyletic, since three sequences from p. amygdaliformis and p. elaeagrifolia formed a highly supported independent clade. these three sequences, representing a paralog termed lfy1int2-c, displayed many unique variations and shared several substitutions with outgroup accessions. lfy1int2-c was reamplified in these four occidental species, and could be frequently cloned in p. amygdaliformis and p. elaeagrifolia. the origin of lfy1int2-c is unclear.

relationships inferred by lfy2int <dig> were much better resolved, with higher support values and fewer polytomies , than those of lfy1int <dig> , but the relationships within most subclades were still unresolved. two major clades were resolved. in clade i, the four occidental species and a clone of 'korlaxiangli'  formed a subclade sister to that of oriental pear including 'yaguang' , p. betulaefolia, p. × phaeocarpa and p. × hopeiensis. in clade ii lfy2int2-ins <dig> and lfy2int2-del <dig> were monophyletic and mixed with lfy2int2-n sequences, thus they were inparalogs of recent origin. it is notable that the four lfy2int2-n sequences from p. xerophila were putative recombinants. they shared mutations with sequence from multiple subclades and also had unique mutations. phylogenetic positions of these p. xerophila sequences were unresolved: p. xerophila  and p. xerophila  were sisters and formed a separate clade, p. xerophila  also formed a separate clade, and p. xerophila  shared mutations with occidental species and formed a separate subclade within clade i. it seems impossible that divergent copies in one genome are all recombinants, thus these sequences were included in the phylogenetic analyses and are highlighted in bold in figure  <dig>  similarly, the lfy2int2-s of p. fauriei formed an unresolved separate clade.

discussion
frequency of adh and leafy duplication
gene duplication plays an important role in increasing the diversity of gene function and expression, which can enable plants to colonize diverse habitats. most monocots and dicots have at least two adh genes, indicating that an initial adh gene duplication occurred before the divergence of these plant taxa, and separate duplications have subsequently taken place  <cit> . two major loci in malus and pyrus, adh <dig> and adh <dig>  are outparalogs derived from an ancient gene split. based on an estimated  <dig> % rate of nucleotide substitution per million year of adh in drosophila  <cit>  and  <dig> - <dig> % in mammalian nuclear genes  <cit> , the split occurred approximately  <dig> million years ago. in maize adh <dig> and adh <dig> share 87% identity at the amino acid sequence level but are located on different chromosomes and differ in the level of tissue-specific expression  <cit> . the expression of three adh genes with 85% and 87% shared amino acid identity in vitis vinifera varied in developmental stage of grape berries and affinity to either ethanol or acetaldehyde as a substrate  <cit> . adh from apple had optimal acetaldehyde activity at ph  <dig> - <dig>  and ethanol activity at ph  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . therefore, adh1- <dig> and adh2- <dig> in pyrus  with less shared identity, likely also have diversified their expression patterns and substrate affinity. adh plays an essential role in the biosynthetic pathway of aroma volatiles in apple and pear fruits by reducing aldehydes to alcohols  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine functional divergence of adh genes and kinetic properties of the corresponding adh enzymes in pyrus and malus.

two paralogs representing adh <dig>  and adh <dig>  were observed by g-pcr. among these the adh2- <dig> may be the most ancestral since it has the classical nine-intron adh structure, which is widely conserved among angiosperms and gymnosperms  <cit> . intron losses have been found in adh genes of diverse taxa like arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and mangifera indica  <cit> . in some species of leavenwortia, an expressed intronless adh <dig> locus occurs and is thought to have arisen by an mrna intermediate  <cit> . the single intron loss found in our study lends support to the 'intron exclusion hypothesis', which suggests that a single intron could be precisely removed by double strand breaks from a multiple-intron gene  <cit> . adh1- <dig>  with the same gene structure as adh1- <dig>  was a putative nonfunctional outparalog derived by gene duplication . gene duplication leading to adh1- <dig>  as inferred by the tree topology , occurred before malus and pyrus diverged, but probably after diversification of pyreae taxa, since the orthologous adh gene in fragaria  displayed the classical nine-intron structure. additionally, the nsd between adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig> in pyrus was  <dig>  , which was much lower than that between adh1- <dig> in pyrus and adh in fragaria  . however, the nsd in the coding region between these outparalogs was too low to confirm the non-functionality of adh1- <dig>  adh2- <dig> was not obtained in malus accessions by g-pcr, probably due to an amplification preference for adh2- <dig>  but its transcription was detected in 'fuji' . adh2- <dig> was recovered neither in pyrus by g-pcr and sg-pcr nor in malus or pyrus by rt-pcr. compared with adh1- <dig> and adh1- <dig>  the asd between adh2- <dig> and adh2- <dig> was much higher  and exon/intron structure also varied . due to the lack of highly homologous adh <dig> sequences from other rosaceae taxa, is the origin of adh2- <dig> is uncertain. it may be a duplicated inparalog derived from adh2- <dig> and restricted to malus taxa or a functional outparalog that appeared before malus and pyrus diverged and was subsequently lost during diversification of pyrus species. the latter theory is similar to the paralog sorting of rpb <dig> and rpb <dig> in different core eudicots taxa  <cit> . specific rt-pcr for additional tissues and specific g-pcr for more rosaceae taxa will be needed to examine the origin and transcription of adh2- <dig>  three subparalogs representing adh1- <dig>  were identified by accession sequencing , although adh1-1c may not be transcribed. it is unknown whether similar subparalogs have evolved for adh1- <dig> and adh2- <dig> 

our study revealed that ancient and recent duplications led to the complex structure of adh outparalogs in pyrus and malus resulting in neofunctionalization, nonfunctionalization and possible subfunctionalization, the three common fates of gene duplications. adh homologs in malus and pyrus were more complex than those in other angiosperms like paeonia  <cit> , grasses  <cit>  or legumes  <cit> , but similar to those in gossypium  <cit> . gossypium has at least seven adh loci of two primary lineages in diploid species and the adh gene family is dynamic with pseudogenization and gene elimination. genomic data suggest that almost all angiosperms, perhaps even all plant groups, have experienced one to several rounds of polyploidy  <cit> . though malus and pyrus accessions used in this study were all diploid , pyreae taxa with x =  <dig> are derived from autopolyploidization of the formerly spiraeoid ancestors with x =  <dig>  <cit> . this apparently accounts for such complex paralogs, and similar adh gene structures could be imputed for other pyreae taxa with x =  <dig> 

leafy was first found to be a homeotic gene encoding a transcription regulator for differentiation of the floral meristem and flowering time in arabidopsis and was expected to be a single-copy gene in diploid angiosperms  <cit> . in our study, two major lineages, lfy <dig> and lfy <dig>  were recovered in both pyrus and malus, as in many other pyreae taxa including the formerly spiradeae taxa with x =  <dig>  <cit> , suggesting gene duplication of these two paralogs before diversification of the rosaceae. lfy <dig> and lfy <dig> in apple are located on distinct chromosomes and thus are not alleles  <cit> . in a study including the pear cultivars 'housui'  and 'barlett' , the transcriptional patterns of two leafy homologs differed in developmental stages and tissues, and each homolog varied among plant taxa  <cit> . in our study, genus-specific and locus-specific indels were discovered in coding regions, which would alter the length of the corresponding amino acid sequences. these might be responsible for the diversification of leafy gene functions.

multiple inparalogs of lfy1int <dig> and lfy2int <dig> were observed, and their recovery varied among our accessions . lfy1int2-a and lfy1int2-b were unequally observed among pyrus species . lfy1int2-a is monophyletic with shorter branch lengths than lfy1int2-b , suggesting it might be an inparalog derived from lfy1int2-b by a recent duplication. this would have occurred after the divergence of occidental and oriental pears, because only lfy1int2-a is not found in occidental pears. consequently, lfy1int2-b was lost during diversification of some oriental species, which explains paralog sorting during diversification of pyrus. three lfy1int2-c sequences in two west asian species  formed a separate clade . we suggest two possible explanations for their origin: 1) they are pseudogenes derived from lfy1int2-b, but have evolved more rapidly, and thus are highly divergent from lfy2int2-b; 2) they represent another outparalog of lfy1int <dig>  derived from gene duplication that occurred before diversification of the occidental species, that was subsequently lost in some occidental species. however, only the second intron of lfy1int2-c was sequenced. to help differentiate between these two possibilities the entire exonic region must be obtained and its presence in more pyrus species investigated. for lfy2int <dig>  the common lfy2int2-n was recovered in all accessions but 'yali' . lfy2int2-ins <dig> and lfy2int2-del <dig> are inparalogs that originated recently after pyrus diversification and were only recovered in a few accessions . lfy2int2-s, with a long insertion homologous noncoding region of s-rnase gene, was similar to functional afl1a copies found in some apple cultivars  <cit> . genomic southern analysis also showed that apple had other homologues in addition to afl <dig> and afl <dig>  <cit> . however, the relationships among these homologs have not been published. only a few accessions contained lfy2int2-s , and only the one from p. fauriei was included in our analyses. it is unknown how the intron of the rnase gene was inserted in the second intron of lfy <dig> and whether lfy2int2-s is functional. additional research found both lfy2int2-s and lfy2int2-n in multiple species, and showed the lfy2int2-s sequences were all highly divergent from lfy2int2-n even after exclusion of the large insertion .

incongruence and poor resolution
paralogs and lineage sorting are two major challenges when conducting phylogenetic analyses based on lcngs, because they can lead to incongruent patterns similar to those resulting from hybridization and polyploidization  <cit> . paralogs reflect a horizontal event, the gene duplication in one species, while orthologs reflect a vertical event, the speciation in a lineage  <cit> . thus, it is crucial to differentiate paralogs from orthologs by investigating their origins and monophyletic positions in the tree. we have clearly identified the outparalogs and inparalogs for both adh and leafy genes. if inparalogs representing lfy1int <dig> and lfy2int <dig> were not identified, p. calleryana possessing both lfy1int2-a and lfy1int2-b as well as lfy2int2-n and lfy2int2-del <dig> would be polyphyletic in both gene trees  and presumed to be hybrids involving other pyrus species. however, p. calleryana is one of the most ancestral species in pyrus and should not be a hybrid of other pyrus species. additionally, pyrus ussuriensis, p. × hopeiensis, p. × phaeocarpa and p. hondoensis containing only lfy1int2-a fell in the same clade. this shows a close relationship . however, p. betuleafolia was not in the clade and only contained lfy1int2-b. these findings were inconsistent with the hypothesis that p. betuleafolia was involved in the origin of p. × hopeiensis and p. × phaeocarpa and to the phylogeny based on lfy2int2-n.

interspecific hybridization has been considered the major mode of evolution for pyrus  <cit> , and lcng has been useful for testing the hypothesis of hybridization, since homologs of a nuclear locus from both parents could be detected in putative hybrids through cloning  <cit> . excluding the possibility of paralogs, incongruence caused by hybridization and lineage sorting could be differentiated by comparing phylogenies of multiple unlinked nuclear loci. only adh1-1c and lfy2int2-n are shown to be two independent orthologs, and they were recovered in all accessions . as described above, relationships revealed by adh1-1c were poorly resolved, and most intra-species and intra-individual sequences were polymorphic. as shown in figure  <dig>  intra-individual sequences of p. calleryana, p. hondoensis and p. dimorphophylla were polyphyletic, and the occidental species were not monophyletic. however, the putative interspecific hybrids, p. × hopeinensis and p. × phaeocarpa, were monophyletic, which was incongruent with other gene trees and our previous understanding of these species. in contrast, only four accessions were polymorphic in the lfy2int2-n tree, including p. × phaeocarpa, p. × hopeiensis, and 'korlaxiangli'  , all of which were putative interspecific hybrids. therefore, lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphic adh1-1c alleles may have occurred during diversification of pyrus.

the phylogenetic relationships revealed by lfy2int2-n were mostly congruent to other orthologous gene trees and previous studies based on other data. close relationships among p. calleryana, p. dimorphophylla, p. pashia, p. pyrifolia, and/or p. × serrulata were supported by all gene trees, suggesting a close relationship among these species. two distinct lfy2int2-n sequences of 'korlaxiangli'  were grouped with occidental species and p. pyrifolia, respectively . similar relationships were found in adh1-1a, adh1-1c and adh1- <dig> clades , which supports the hypothesis that p. sinkiangensis is an interspecific hybrid involving at least p. communis and p. pyrfolia  <cit> . intra-individual copies of p. × hopeiensis and p. × phaeocarpa were grouped with p. ussuriensis, p. hondoensis or p. betulaefolia in both the adh1-1a clade  and lfy2int2-n  clade. pyrus × phaeocarpa was a putative hybrid involving p. betulaefolia and p. ussuriensis, and p. × hopeiensis was a hybrid involving p. × phaeocarpa and p. ussuriensis. pyrus hondoensis, which was once classified as a variety of p. ussuriensis by morphological data  <cit> , and p. ussuriensis were found to be closely related  <cit> . phylogenetic relationships among these species were supported by multiple orthologous gene data, suggesting ancient hybridization rather than lineage sorting. more wild individuals of these species are needed to test such complex evolutionary histories.

the relationships based on all separate orthologs were mostly poorly resolved. in our study, different adh and leafy paralogs showed a relative low sequence divergence . lfy2int2-n showed the highest proportion of informative sites  which was similar to results in neillia and stephanandra   <cit> . low sequence divergence of multiple dna regions suggests rapid radiation during divergence  <cit>  and this has been hypothesized for many pyreae taxa   <cit> . this may also explain the poor resolution of the gene trees. another contribution to the poor resolution in this study is the conflicting signals caused by recombinants. recombinants are derived from two homologous chromosomes in one genome during meiosis  or pcr , leading to incorrect phylogenetic inferences  <cit> . as predicted by statistical principles, we found that putative recombinants formed separated clades. recombinants represent substitutions of two distinct lineages, and thus receive no bootstrap support from either of the lineages in a cladistic phylogeny . in this study, most putative recombinants represent one of the intra-individual polymorphic copies and were excluded from analyses. the four lfy2int2-n copies of p. xerophila all displayed the characteristics of recombinants, and formed separate clades in the tree . polymorphic lfy2int2-n copies in p. xerophila may all be ancient genetic recombinants that arose by interspecific hybridization involving both oriental and occidental species. more individuals of p. xerophila and occidental species are necessary to confirm this hypothesis and investigate the origin of this species.

phylogenetic utility of the introns
among three adh1- <dig> subparalogs, adh1-1c was orthologous and recovered in all accessions, but it resulted in a poorly resolved phylogeny due to lack of informative sites and possible lineage sorting . this makes it inadequate for the phylogenic reconstruction of pyrus. the two introns of adh1- <dig>  adh2- <dig> and adh2- <dig>  were not sequenced and analyzed in the current study, and it is unknown whether multiple subparalogs also exist for these paralogs. adh2- <dig> might not exist in pyrus species as discussed above. the phylogenetic utility of the introns of adh2- <dig> and adh1- <dig> needs to be estimated, which will require primers designed specifically to the paralogs.

lfy1int <dig> was not suitable for studying interspecific relationships due to sorting of lfy1int2-a and lfy1int2-b paralogs and the unclear origin of lfy1int2-c. in contrast, lfy2int2-n showed the highest sequence divergence, resulting in the best-resolved tree. inparalogs of lfy2int2-ins <dig> and lfy2int2-del <dig>  as well as the lfy2int2-s of unclear origin, could be easily identified and removed from phylogenetic inferences. most importantly, relationships based on lfy2int2-n were congruent to previous studies based on morphological and molecular marker data. conflicting placement of species may be resolved by using lfy2int2-n. it provides reliable evidence of ancient hybridization, since incomplete lineage sorting was not imputed for lfy2int2-n. phylogenetic studies of pyrus based on nuclear gene regions have been rare. only the its region has been applied to a wide range of east asian pyrus species, but it resulted in a poorly resolved tree  <cit> . one study based on the 18s gene focused only on two species, p. pyrifolia and p. communis  <cit> . we conclude that lfy2int2-n is currently the most useful nuclear gene region for phylogenetic inference in pyrus. it is as yet unknown whether additional inparalogs representing lfy2int <dig> will be found by analyzing more occidental species and individuals of oriental species.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study that explores lcngs for phylogenetic analyses in pyrus. it is also the first to document the gene structures and transcription of adh homologs in the rosaceae taxa. we demonstrated that frequent gene duplications contributed to complex outparalogs and inparalogs of adh genes with functional diversification or nonfunctionalization. paralogs, lineage sorting of alleles, and recombinants are three major problems when applying lcngs in plant phylogenetic analyses. one ortholog of leafy, lfy2int2-n, is currently the best nuclear marker for studying interspecific relationships of pyrus. complex reticulate histories likely complicate the phylogenetic reconstruction of some pyrus species. to better resolve interspecific relationships and examine the evolutionary processes of pyrus, we are extending our phylogenetic studies with plastid dna and nuclear dna, including lfyint2-n, and by sampling a wider assortment of species and individuals.
