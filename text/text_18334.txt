BACKGROUND
the greatest ever reconstructed journey of our own species  begins in africa with a group of hunter-gatherers, perhaps just a few hundred strong and ends some  <dig> –  <dig> thousand years  later with their six and a half billion descendants spread across the occupied world. most of the dna and archaeological evidence are in agreement of the proposition. however, route and time of such spread, undertaken by the anatomically modern africans to populate the world has been the greater untold part of the story. recent genetic studies  suggest single "southern route" dispersal of modern humans, extended from the horn of africa, across the mouth of the red sea into arabia and southern asia some time before  <dig> ky  <cit> . subsequently, the modern human populations expanded rapidly along the coastlines of southern asia, southeastern asia and indonesia to arrive in australia at least by  <dig> thousand years before present , best represented by the anatomically modern human skeleton from the site of lake mungo  <dig> in new south wales  <cit> . an early phylogenetic link between indians and australian aborigines has also been suggested by observations based on morphology  <cit> . the major challenge to this scenario is to document individual steps in this colonization process based on genetics and archaeological evidence. the mtdna lineages sampled so far from south asia, eastern asia and australasia show non-overlapping distributions of haplogroups within macrohaplogroups m and n and its subclade r  <cit> . the archaeological map of arabia and india are at present largely blank for the critical period from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> kybp  <cit> and whatever intriguing hints of early modern human occupations are available from the site of patne in western india,  <cit> jwalapuram in southern india  <cit>  and batadomba-lena in sri lanka  <cit>  suggest closer affinities to african middle stone age traditions,  <cit>  whereas, similarly "advanced" technologies in the area to the east of the indian subcontinent, especially in the relatively well-explored area of australia and new guinea are lacking  <cit> .

RESULTS
the complete mtdna sequencing indicate that both australians and new guineans exclusively belongs to the out-of-africa founder types m and n, thus ultimately descended from the same african emigrants ~ <dig> to  <dig> kybp, as all other eurasians  <cit> . however, in context of the eurasian phylogeny  <cit> , shared branches more recent than the founding types m, n, and r have not been reported so far, except a shared variant at nucleotide position  <dig> between australian specific haplogroup m <dig> and east/southeast eurasian specific haplogroup m <dig>  <cit> .

our complete mtdna sequencing of  <dig> individuals from  <dig> relic populations of india identified seven individuals from central dravidian and austro-asiatic tribes who share two basal synonymous mtdna polymorphisms g8251a and a9156t with the m <dig> haplogroup, which is specific to australian aborigines. the phylogenetic reconstruction of  <dig> indian  and  <dig> australian aborigine mtdna sequences from published source  <cit>  is shown in figure  <dig>  and it differs from the previous reports  <cit>  in the placement of the g8251a polymorphism. this polymorphism together with a9156t is present in all  <dig> indian samples of this study, as well in one indian sample  reported previously based on rflp  <cit>  and in  <dig> out of  <dig> australian sequences used in this reconstruction. both g8251a and a9156t are considered ancestral to m <dig>  but the lack of g8251a in an australian sub lineage consisting of two genomes indicates a back mutation event. being based on the combination of two synonymous polymorphisms and their replication in quite a few indian samples , the present phylogenetic reconstruction of the haplogroup m <dig> seems parsimonious and more stable than the previously suggested m <dig> and m <dig> link through  <dig> polymorphism  <cit> .

the coalescence time estimate  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kybp of the average sequence divergence of the indian and australian m <dig> coding-region sequences from the root is consistent with the first evidence of human occupation provided by  <dig> silcrete flakes with plain and relatively thick striking platforms recovered from below the lowest gravels in the barrier sands of the mungo b trench,  <cit>  bracketed by ages of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kybp  <cit> . the similar or slightly older ages for the initial human arrival in northern and western australia  <cit>  also seem to be in agreement. the underlying deposits at mungo b trench, dated to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kybp, appear to be culturally sterile  <cit> suggesting colonization of continental australia some time after  <dig> kybp from south asia.

the shared lineage provides direct genetic evidence to the long suggested ancient link between india and australia  <cit> . however the deep divergence  of the indian and australian branches within m <dig>  coupled with the evidence of the earliest and most pronounced population expansion outside africa in southern asia estimated to ~ <dig> kybp using bayesian skyline analysis  <cit>  followed by high mtdna diversity in indian populations  <cit> , strongly suggest that australia perhaps along with east/southeast eurasia and papua new guinea  <cit>  was populated from southern asia plausibly slightly before or in the beginning of the population expansion that has given rise to a large number of mtdna lineages within macrohaplogroup 'm' in india.

CONCLUSIONS
our results showing a shared mtdna lineage between indians and australian aborigines provides direct genetic evidence that australia was populated by modern humans through south asia following the "southern route". the divergence of the indian and australian m <dig> coding-region sequences suggests an early colonization of australia, ~ <dig> to  <dig> kybp, quite in agreement with archaeological evidences.
