BACKGROUND
the centromere is a specific region of the eukaryotic chromosome that is the assembly point of the kinetochore, a group of proteins that act as a tether for microtubules during cell division. although eukaryotic centromeres have highly conserved machinery for chromosome segregation, centromere sequences and binding proteins specific to centromeric chromatin are highly variable, even among closely related taxa  <cit> . specific retroelements and highly homogenized tandem repeats are common in the dna of eukaryotic centromeres  <cit> , though these too apparently diverge rapidly among closely related species  <cit> . appropriate recruitment of these potentially co-evolving molecular components to the same site is enigmatic, as is their mechanism of spread and homogenization among chromosomes. explanations for the apparent paradox between conservation of function but variability in sequence typically invoke an interplay between centromere function, centromere sequences, and epigenetic factors, such that dna sequences per se become less functionally constrained  <cit> . accordingly, it is generally accepted that centromeres are specified epigenetically  <cit> .

the evolution of cenh <dig> is of particular interest due to its centrality in centromere specification and function  <cit> . unlike its highly conserved counterpart , cenh <dig> has extensive sequence variability, particularly in two regions:  the non-canonical nh <dig> terminal tail,  the longer loop  <dig> region  <cit> . dna sequence diversity as well as alternative splicing can both play roles in generating diversity, which is thought to compensate for the fast-evolving centromeric dna to ensure consistent centromeric function, although centromeric sequences are neither necessary nor sufficient for kinetochore assembly  <cit> .

given the twin observations of rapid sequence homogenization of centromeric repeats among chromosomes within species, yet rapid divergence among repeats between species, the question arises as to the fate of centromeric repeats, and cenh <dig> evolution, in allopolyploids. polyploidy plays an integral role in the evolution of many organisms, particularly plants  <cit> . the consequences of polyploidy are often extensive  <cit> , and the resulting duplicated genes have myriad possible fates  <cit> , including gene loss. patterns of gene retention and loss following genome duplication have been extensively studied with respect to their broad classifications  <cit> . because two presumably divergent suites of centromeric sequences become reunited into common nucleus at the time of allopolyploid formation, it is intriguing to investigate the subsequent evolutionary dynamics of the centromeric repeats as well as the now duplicated cenh <dig> sequences. in most modern diploids, cenh <dig> appears to have returned to single copy status following paleopolyploidy events  <cit> , with a few notable exceptions  <cit> . in contrast, recent allopolyploids often have multiple cenh <dig> gene copies  <cit> .

here we evaluate the fate of cenh <dig> in allopolyploids from three divergent genera  to address the question of whether the evolution of cenh <dig> is similar across a broad range of angiosperm taxa. the genera selected contain a diversity of allopolyploid species having either monophyletic or polyphyletic origins. the brassica genus contains three diverse and widely cultivated diploid species  and three allopolyploid species resulting from independent polyploidization events   <cit> , while oryza contains multiple diploid genome groups  and allopolyploids of diverse genomic origin   <cit> . gossypium includes  <dig> diploid species divided into genome groups designated a – g and k  <cit> , as well as a single, monophyletic  <cit>  polyploid clade  containing  <dig> species. previous work on cenh <dig> in brassica and oryza allopolyploids has focused on selection in specific regions of the gene and the relative expression of the retained homoeologs  <cit> . less is known about cenh <dig> and centromeric evolution in allopolyploid gossypium. a prior study reported a centromeric gypsy-like retroelement  present in all centromeres of both the allotetraploid g. hirsutum  and the model progenitor d-genome diploid , but absent from a-genome species  <cit> . neither the sequence nor the expression of duplicated cenh <dig> have been evaluated.

we characterize cenh <dig> sequence evolution on in three phylogenetically disparate angiosperm genera containing diploids and allopolyploids, and assess patterns of molecular evolution. we address whether allopolyploids retain duplicated copies following allopolyploid formation; the dynamics of sequence evolution of the duplicated, newly co-resident sequences; and the relative expression levels of homoeologous copies. in addition to reporting on cenh <dig> sequence evolution within and between genera, we describe novel patterns of alternative splicing in cenh <dig> 

RESULTS
we cloned and sequenced the cenh <dig> genes from  <dig> diploid and  <dig> allotetraploid gossypium species. the length of genomic sequences varied from  <dig> to 2673 bp in the diploids and  <dig> to 2673 bp in the polyploids , although protein-coding length was consistent for all species, 492 bp. while length variation was not detected among cdnas, we cannot account for length variation that occurs outside of our external primers in the first and last exons. the structure of cenh <dig>   <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, was conserved among all polyploid species, . as expected, cenh <dig> was largely conserved across the genus, with the majority of polymorphisms occurring in introns. gossypium exiguum exhibited the greatest difference observed among the diploids ; the remainder of the polymorphisms were small , five of which were phylogenetically informative .

since cenh <dig> is thought to co-evolve with rapidly changing centromeric dna, we mapped nonsynonymous substitutions to the secondary protein structure for three genera   in order to localize evolution along the protein. the n terminus was the only domain with high levels of nonsynonymous substitutions that was consistent between all three genera. brassica had the highest numbers of nonsynonomous substitutions, which was followed by oryza and then gossypium. this observation is in agreement with previous analyses which show that rates of molecular evolution are faster in herbaceous plants  than in trees and shrubs   <cit> .figure  <dig>

to determine the extent of cenh <dig> evolution, we compared ka/ks  ratios for all cdss of a species from each genus with respect to an outgroup. cenh <dig> is indeed a relatively fast evolving gene, with the brassica, oryza, and gossypium genes falling in the 81st, 85th, and 97th percentile of all genes in these genomes, respectively .figure  <dig>

to quantify cenh <dig> evolution in each genus we estimated the mean ka/ks of cenh <dig> using dnasp   <cit> . the overall mean ka/ks ratios within each genus and between each genus and an outgroup all indicate that diversifying selection is absent from the cenh <dig> gene as a whole. to determine whether this finding is consistent at a finer scale, we used the mixed effects model of evolution software   <cit>  to evaluate selection at the codon level in each genus . in brassica and oryza, the only codons with evidence suggestive of diversifying selection were limited to the n terminus, while no evidence of diversifying selection was found for gossypium. inferred codons subject to selection in oryza and brassica were phylogenetically episodic and specific to only a few species for each codon .table  <dig>

cenh <dig> evolution in allopolyploids
given the single copy status observed in most diploid angiosperms sequenced to date, despite an evolutionary history, which encompasses multiple episodes of polyploidy, we wished to address whether or not cenh <dig> has been retained in duplicate following recent allopolyploidy events. in gossypium, we found that each diploid representative had a single cenh <dig> gene and that all allopolyploid species had two, indicating retention of both parental copies, as reported for brassica and oryza  <cit> .

to address whether or not duplicated cenh <dig> sequences evolve independently of one another following allopolyploid formation, or if instead they are subjected to some form of sequence interaction or homogenization, we manually analyzed cenh <dig> sequences from all three genera. this lack of independence has been demonstrated for other homoeologous single copy genes in allopolyploids, most notably in gossypium where the phenomenon was first described  <cit> . cenh <dig> gene conversion was absent in all three genera, which is consistent with previous reports in brassica and oryza  <cit> .

genomic dna sequences for cenh <dig> from gossypium were used to construct a maximum likelihood tree, which concurs with the currently accepted phylogeny for the genus . we resolved monophyletic clades for both the at and dt homoeologs and their respective model diploid progenitors. gene conversion was not detected in the homoeologs, further confirming that independent evolution of cenh <dig> homeologs occurred in this 1– <dig> myd polyploid clade.

cenh <dig> gene expression
as mentioned above, there are various possible fates for genes duplicated via polyploidy. while both parental copies of cenh <dig> were retained in all studied allopolyploid species of oryza, brassica, and gossypium, the transcriptional usage of each parental copy can vary from equivalent to complete silencing of one parental copy. to assess expression of cenh <dig> in gossypium, we used three independent methods that allow us to assess the relative expression of homoeologs. the same tissue source was used for clone-counting and chromatogram measurements, while rna-seq data from different sources was used to investigate other aspects of cenh <dig> expression. the rna-seq data sources included  to determine the relative expression of cenh <dig> in the model diploid progenitors to the cotton polyploids, a synthetic hybrid between these two diploids , a synthetic polyploid , and a domesticated and wild accession of ad <dig> .

the three methods to analyze expression resulted in differing degrees of homoeolog bias , which was moderate in the rna-seq data, and more extreme in the other methods . at homoeolog, expression was favored in every species, tissue, and test . with rna-seq data we compared the total expression levels of the model progenitor diploids , a synthetic polyploid ), and wild and domesticated accessions of ad <dig> , all of which lacked a significant difference in expression. the only sample with a significant expression bias was the f <dig>  biased at  <dig> % . the difference in homoeolog expression was not significantly different  between leaf and bud tissue, except that at homoeolog expression was significantly higher in leaves for g. barbadense .figure  <dig>

due to the sequence similarity between homoeologs, specific primers could not be designed for quantitative pcr, and thus we measured homoeolog expression bias with three separate methods, accompanied by different caveats. due to the low number of snps between the homoeologs, a large number of rna-seq reads could not be allocated to a particular homoeolog. we also cloned cenh <dig> cdnas, which were counted to calculate relative expression of homoeologs, albeit with a smaller sample size .

alternative splicing
alternative splicing of transcripts is one mechanism by which novel proteins are created, which conceivably may provide the diversity for interaction between rapidly evolving partners like cenh <dig> and centromeric dna. to address how alternative splicing affects cenh <dig>  we assessed the level of alternative splicing for each homoeolog of cenh <dig> in allopolyploid gossypium by cloning and sequencing the amplified cenh <dig> cdnas from leaf and leaf bud tissues. the sum frequency of alternatively spliced transcripts for both tissues was  <dig> %  and consisted of  <dig> exon deletions and  <dig> intron retentions  for all allopolyploids. three splicing variants were found in all species evaluated :  45 bp intron retention at position  <dig> ;  a 6 bp exon deletion from position 137– <dig> ; and  a 39 bp exon deletion in at homeologs from 137– <dig> . one splicing variant, a 12 bp intron retention, was shared only between g. hirsutum  and g. tomentosum  . the most common splicing variants resulted in either a slight deletion or extension of the n terminus, thus adding diversity to an already rapidly evolving domain of cenh <dig>  while the least common splicing variants resulted in nonfunctional protein predictions.figure  <dig>

g. hirsutum  had the highest frequency of spliced transcripts at  <dig> % . each species had a different proportion of each splicing variant; for example, the exon 137– <dig> deletion was present in 25% of g. hirsutum  clones, while it was present at  <dig> - <dig> % of other species.  <dig> % of g. mustelinum  clones included the 45 bp intron insertion at position  <dig>  which was only present  <dig> - <dig> % in the other species .

discussion
despite its crucial role in centromere specification, many aspects of cenh <dig> evolution are poorly understood. recent years have brought advances in our understanding of centromere epigenetics and evolution. for example, tandem repeats in many species have an evolutionary relationship with the cenh <dig> protein to reduce nucleosomal bending energy  <cit> , multiple proteins interact with centromeric dna to induce positive supercoiling of centromeric dna  <cit> , and cenpa  provides the foundation for binding other kinetochore proteins  <cit> .

cenh <dig> sequence evolution in angiosperms
the present study extends our knowledge of the pace and process of cenh <dig> evolution by evaluating genomic and expression changes in three diverse angiosperm genera. previous research in brassica and oryza showed that the cenh <dig> n terminus and catd  sequences were under diversifying selection in lineage specific manners  <cit> . to assess the generality of these findings in angiosperms, we reanalyzed the oryza and brassica sequences at a finer scale to identify specific regions of cenh <dig> that have actively diversified, and performed the first cenh <dig> sequence analysis for gossypium. across all three genera, diversification generally occurs in the n terminus, a result consistent with previous reports of rapid evolution in this domain, but contrary to reports of diversification in the cenpa targeting domain  <cit> .

retention and expression of cenh <dig> alleles in allopolyploids
in all three genera, both homoeologous copies are retained following genome doubling, demonstrating that restoration to single copy status, as widely observed among modern “diploid” plants, need not occur quickly following wgd events. interestingly, expression of homoeologous cenh <dig> copies in gossypium exhibited directional bias in all samples, although differences were not always statistically significant ; this result contrasts with reports from brassica and oryza allopolyploids  <cit> . in brassica allotetraploids, a variety of cenh <dig> expression patterns were found for homoeologs, from a 2: <dig> ratio in an accession of b. juncea to complete b-genome cenh <dig> suppression in an accession of b. carinata  <cit> . in allotetraploid o. minuta and o. alta, cenh <dig> expression is unbiased  <cit> . the variation in expression profiles among allopolyploids in these three genera is notable and without an obvious explanation, although it seems likely that homoeolog expression levels reflect the unique genomic and evolutionary idiosyncrasies that characterize hybridization and genome doubling in each genus.

alternative splicing of cenh3
in addition to non-synonymous evolution, protein diversity may be generated by alternative splicing. considering the three genera collectively, it appears that alternative splicing frequently modifies the n terminus of cenh <dig> in brassica and gossypium, and this is the only domain modified in oryza  <cit> . interestingly, the n terminus often cannot be aligned among closely related genera, yet it is necessary for centromeric deposition of cenh <dig> during meiosis in a. thaliana  <cit> . the n terminus also interacts with kinetochore proteins in s. cerivisiae  <cit> . perhaps alternative splicing represents another means to generate the diversity of sequences necessary for cenh <dig> to target centromeres in meiosis, or a rapid defense that introduces new cenh <dig> proteins in response to increased centromere size. an alternative is that alternative splicing can also lead to a differing abundance of alternate transcripts between cells and tissues, which has implications in centromeric dna if cenh <dig> and centromeric dna are indeed coevolving.

CONCLUSIONS
by comparing the cenh <dig> sequences from three disparate angiosperm genera, we have gained insight into the rates and regions of evolution in this important protein. the most commonly mutated domain is the n terminus, which is also subject to alternative splicing, and contributes significantly to diversity in the n terminus of brassica and gossypium cenh3s. alternative splicing is largely absent from the histone fold domain, even though loop  <dig> and α <dig> helix domains bind centromeric dna, which therefore likely are subject to length constraints.

while cenh <dig> is considered a rapidly evolving protein, the n terminus is the only domain that is unalignable among closely related genera and is the most diverse domain. roles have been attributed to the n terminus of cenh <dig>  such as ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis  <cit>  and it is indispensable for meiotic localization of cenh <dig>  yet the domain is expendable in mitosis  <cit> . in humans the n terminus is a hotspot for posttranslational modifications that interact with other centromeric proteins  <cit> , and perhaps this is the case in plants as well. at present, the functional explanation for the diversity generated by both conventional protein evolution in the n terminal domain, as well as alternative splicing, remain unexplained.

the basis for the interest in cenh <dig> is its ability to bind to rapidly evolving centromeric repeats and yet still interact with conserved elements in the kinetochore. the dynamics of this relationship at the polyploid scale are increasingly complex due to the duplication of cenh <dig> and exposure to a new regime centromere repeats. the mono and polyphyletic origins of polyploids seem to influence the direction and level of expression bias between cenh <dig> homoeologs  and is most pronounced after hybridization, as is seen in the f <dig> of gossypium, but not following polyploidy  <dig>  another compelling issue is obtaining diversity in these transcripts to respond to repeat evolution in the centromere, which is sparse in our tests for selection. alternative splicing may be an another means to obtain this diversity, although neither selection nor alternative splicing modified the dna binding domain of cenh <dig>  since the n terminus is the only domain modified by alternative splicing and subject to diversifying selection, but the dna binding domains are not, rapidly evolving centromere sequences are unlikely to be the primary driver of cenh <dig> sequence diversification.
