BACKGROUND
the influence of complex genetics on neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, is evidenced by the consideration that family history is a significant risk factor for candidate patients  <cit> . although interacting loci may influence a variety of different factors, one common element is the process of neuronal cell death, which predominantly occurs by apoptosis  <cit> . consequently, consideration of the genes that affect susceptibility to disease should include those that affect both the response of neurons to damaging stimuli and the process of cell death itself. several studies, using screening strategies of inbred mouse lines, have reinforced the concept that genetic background has an influence on the level of susceptibility to neuronal damage  <cit> . at least  <dig> loci have been mapped, for example, that affect neuronal susceptibility to the parkinsonian neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine   <cit> .

primary open angle glaucoma is also a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease with a strong familial component  <cit> . this disease affects an estimated  <dig> million individuals worldwide  <cit>  and is characterized by the progressive apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells and the degeneration of the optic nerve  <cit> . all forms of glaucoma are associated with critical elevations in intraocular pressure , but humans exhibit a wide range of susceptibility to this stimulus. although most glaucoma patients have a higher than average iop, the majority of ocular hypertensives will never develop the disease  <cit> . conversely, there is a significant percentage of glaucoma sufferers who have normal or below normal iop  <cit> . in the majority of people with glaucoma, however, lowering iop regardless of the starting level, has a beneficial effect in slowing the progression of the disease. this clinical history of disease progression and response to treatment has led to the concept that there is variable susceptibility to the damaging effects of eye pressure  <cit> .

one genetically regulated component that could influence ganglion cell susceptibility is the cell death process itself. in response to a majority of cell death stimuli, retinal ganglion cell death in mice is restricted to bax-dependent, intrinsic apoptosis, a pathway common to many neurons of the cns. this pathway is activated during development  <cit> , after acute optic nerve lesion  <cit> , or in chronic spontaneous glaucoma  <cit> . since apoptosis is an intrinsic genetic process, differences in alleles of genes that affect cell death could influence ganglion cell susceptibility to a damaging stimulus. reducing bax gene dosage, for example, reduces the level of latent bax mrna and can completely abrogate ganglion cell death after optic nerve crush or in glaucoma  <cit> . to explore the possibility that genetic background could affect neuronal cell death, we first investigated if different strains of inbred mice exhibited different levels of ganglion cell loss in response to a standardized lesion of the optic nerve . here, we report that inbred mice have different susceptibilities to optic nerve crush, and that the resistant phenotype can be inherited in a relatively simple mendelian fashion. although bax plays a critical role in regulating ganglion cell susceptibility, we excluded it as a candidate gene for this trait. identification of the gene that affect the susceptibility of retinal ganglion cells to damaging stimuli could help elucidate part of the genetic complexity of glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases.

RESULTS
inbred mice exhibit quantitative differences in ganglion cell loss after optic nerve crush
retinal ganglion cell loss after optic nerve crush occurs over a period of  <dig> weeks, with the most rapid period of loss occurring between the first and second weeks  <cit> . we chose to examine the period of  <dig> weeks after optic nerve crush in order to assess the process of cell death while still at an intermediate stage . a bar graph of the mean  of cells remaining in the crushed retina for  <dig> mice in  <dig> different lines is shown in figure  <dig>  representative micrographs of control and crushed nissl-stained retinas from mice at each end and the middle of this distribution are shown in figure  <dig>  mice exhibited a range of cell loss after  <dig> weeks from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the total neurons in the ganglion cell layer. a matrix of p values comparing each of the means against each other  is shown in table  <dig>  both sets of inbred lines with similar genetic backgrounds  had comparable amounts of cell loss based on statistical testing. there were no significant correlations between coat color and susceptibility or known neurosensory defects and susceptibility .

ganglion cell prevalence in dba/2j and balb/cbyj mice
from the initial screen of  <dig> inbred lines, dba/2j mice were selected as the most resistant, and balb/cbyj mice were selected as the most susceptible. a potential caveat in this study, however, is that cell loss was estimated as a percentage of the total neurons present in the ganglion cell layer. since ganglion cells are not the only neurons present in this layer, our analysis of cell loss would only be accurate if ganglion cells comprised a similar percentage of the neurons in each strain. to assess this, we calculated the total number of neurons in the ganglion cell layers of dba/2j and balb/cbyj mice by counting cells in nissl-stained whole mounts of untreated retinas. we also estimated the total number of ganglion cells in each strain by counting axons in sections of the optic nerves. results of this analysis are shown in table  <dig>  although dba/2j mice have more total neurons in their ganglion cell layer they also have a proportionately higher number of ganglion cells, resulting in the same percentage of ganglion cells in both strains .

dominant inheritance of ganglion cell resistance to crush
to confirm these as resistant and susceptible strains, we performed optic nerve crush on increased numbers of mice from each strain . consistent with the initial screen, dba/2j mice exhibited significantly less cell loss than balb/cbyj mice . to determine whether the susceptibility to optic nerve crush was genetically controlled, crosses were performed between the two strains. f <dig> mice  inherited the optic nerve crush-resistance phenotype exhibited by dba/2j mice . n <dig> mice , exhibited a shift toward a more susceptible phenotype . f <dig> mice  yielded an intermediate phenotype after optic nerve crush with a bias toward the resistance phenotype . by assigning a mean value for cell loss for the resistant and susceptible phenotypes, cell loss in each of the crosses was accurately predicted by the expected distribution of  <dig> dominant alleles using a punnett square method of analysis .

a statistical estimation of the number of affecting loci was made using a modified wright formula, which takes into account the means and variances of the f <dig> mice and the recurrent backcross parental strain  <cit> . this formula yielded a value of  <dig> , suggesting that only a few genes were contributing to the inheritance pattern of this phenotype, consistent with the punnett square analysis.

elimination of bax as a contributing allele to the resistance phenotype
the proapoptotic gene bax is essential for ganglion cell death after optic nerve crush  <cit>  and in chronic spontaneous glaucoma  <cit> . reduced bax expression in mice heterozygous for a bax knock-out allele has varying effects on neurons, depending on genetic background  <cit> , an effect that appears to be related to the level of latent bax mrna from the endogenous wild type gene   <cit> . bax+/- dba/2j mice are completely resistant to optic nerve crush  <cit>  and have relatively low levels of neuronal bax expression. interestingly, dba/2j mice were the most resistant to the same crush protocol of all the inbred mice examined.

to examine bax as a candidate gene for the resistant phenotype, we first quantified bax mrna levels in the brains of dba/2j and balb/cbyj mice using rnase protection assays . both lines express a bax protein with the same predicted amino acid sequence , so if bax was associated with the resistance phenotype, we predicted that balb/cbyj mice would have higher levels of latent neuronal bax mrna. quantitative examination of bax mrna levels in balb/cbyj and dba/2j mice showed no statistical difference between the two lines . in a second experiment, we mapped the segregation of dba/2j  and balb/cbyj  bax alleles in n <dig> and f <dig> mice used in this study. a scatter plot of phenotype as a function of bax genotype is shown in figure  <dig>  evaluation of these data was made comparing mice with the baxb/b background against baxd2/b and baxd2/d <dig> mice . none of the  <dig> possible comparisons yielded a significant association between the bax genotype and the resistance phenotype .

discussion
we screened  <dig> different strains of inbred mice for cell loss caused by optic nerve crush and identified differing levels of susceptibility. dba/2j mice were identified as the most resistant strain, and balb/cbyj mice were identified as the most susceptible strain. offspring of crosses involving these two lines inherited the resistance phenotype, while a backcross of the f <dig> mice to the susceptible parental strain, yielded a population of mice with the susceptible phenotype. the progeny of the f <dig> intercross inherited an intermediate phenotype with a bias toward resistance. the pattern of inheritance exhibited by the crosses suggests involvement of dominant alleles and a punnett square analysis to determine the frequency of inheritance of  <dig> dominant genes, with complete penetrance, accurately predicted the mean cell loss observed in each cross. similarly, a wright formula calculation estimated that a minimum of  <dig>  loci were affecting this phenotype. analysis of bax expression level and allelic segregation with phenotype excluded this gene as a candidate for one of the affecting alleles.

the influence of genetic background on neurodegeneration in inbred mice
several studies have reported that inbred strains of mice exhibit variable susceptibility to neurodegenerative stimuli, but there has been no consistent correlation between strain and susceptibility. c57bl/ <dig> mice, which were relatively crush resistant in our study, are more susceptible to mptp exposure, spinal chord injury, and experimental autoimmune encephalitis  than other strains. conversely, balb/c mice  are resistant to eae and mptp, but exhibit a similar susceptibility as c57bl/ <dig> mice to spinal chord injury. c57bl/ <dig> mice  and b <dig> pl mice, which are eae resistant and susceptible, respectively, both exhibit less severe injury after spinal chord lesion than other strains  <cit> . part of the differences exhibited by some inbred strains may reside in their variable abilities to mount an immune response, which can affect the progression and severity of certain neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . the lack of a correlation between mouse strains and their susceptibility to different degenerative challenges is not surprising. each challenge is potentially unique to different subsets of neurons . it is also likely that different diseases elicit different damaging stimuli, which in turn can activate alternative pathways leading to neuronal death  <cit> .

genes that affect retinal ganglion cell death
recently, libby et al  <cit>  outlined two broad classes of genes that can affect ganglion cell susceptibility to damage in glaucoma. the first class modulates extrinsic susceptibility of ganglion cells. this set of genes is predicted to influence the response of non-ganglion cells  to ocular hypertension, the composition and modulation of the extracellular matrix, the density and regulation of retinal vasculature of the optic nerve head, and possibly the immune responses in the eye. the second class of genes modulates the intrinsic susceptibility of ganglion cells. these latter genes are predicted to directly affect ganglion cell survival. by the nature of our screen, which directly activates apoptosis by axonal lesion, we predict that we are most likely selecting for intrinsic susceptibility genes.

many genes could be intrinsic susceptibility factors. retinal ganglion cell death follows the basic molecular pathways identified in other neurons and several of the key genes involved in cell death could affect ganglion cell susceptibility to damaging stimuli. we examined the bax gene as a candidate based on the evidence that this gene was critical for ganglion cell death in a variety of situations  <cit> . several other genes, however, are also known to influence ganglion cell death. proapoptotic genes active in ganglion cells include c-jun  <cit>  and c-jun terminal kinase   <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , bim  <cit> , apaf- <dig>  <cit> , poly polymerase   <cit> , and several caspases  <cit> . interestingly, a significant association has been reported between p <dig>  haplotypes and primary open angle glaucoma in humans  <cit> .

in addition to proapoptotic genes, ganglion cells are also significantly affected by the expression of antiapoptotic genes. ganglion cells express bclx, whose expression decreases during the initial stages of apoptosis  <cit> . upregulation of this gene in ganglion cells enhances their survival  <cit> . similarly, transgenic mice that overexpress the bclx homolog, bcl <dig>  exhibit nearly complete abrogation of ganglion cell death during development and after optic nerve transection  <cit> . since downregulation of endogenous bclx, along with other normally expressed genes  <cit> , is an early event in ganglion cell apoptosis, any variation that reduces this process and allows these proteins to persist could affect the normal apoptotic program.

damaged ganglion cells in mammals also exhibit an early stress response that includes the up-regulation of heat shock proteins  <cit>  and iron-regulating genes including transferrin and ceruloplasmin  <cit> . these latter genes may also act as antioxidants by scavenging free radicals formed from mitochondria during the cell death process  <cit> .

although bax has been eliminated as a candidate gene in this population of mice, clearly there are other genes that could affect the cell death phenotype. we are currently in the process of conducting a genome wide screen to identify potential loci that affect the resistance phenotype.

using mice to identify susceptibility alleles for glaucoma
in this study, we used inbred mice to assess if genetic background affects the susceptibility of retinal ganglion cells to a lesion of the optic nerve. these experiments do not directly address whether the same genes that affect ganglion cells after optic nerve crush will also be susceptibility alleles for ganglion cells exposed to elevated levels of iop, the principal damaging insult in glaucoma. the actual mechanism linking high iop with ganglion cell damage is still unresolved, but some studies suggest that elevated pressure causes increased sheer forces on the optic nerve at the level of the scleral canal and lamina cribrosa  <cit> . this has lead to the hypothesis that increased iop causes mechanical damage to axons at this region  <cit> , and it is becoming more evident that this is the region of initial damage in glaucoma  <cit> . although the concept of sheer stress acting directly on the axons is attractive, and could be analogous to our crush insult, there are several other mechanisms by which iop can induce damage in this region. these include reducing the perfusion of microvessels in the nerve head and the focal activation of astrocytes and microglia. consequently, it is possible that optic nerve crush may act differently on ganglion cells than elevated iop.

regardless of the nature of the insult, there is some evidence, however, both optic nerve crush and elevated iop result in a similar cell death response within the ganglion cells themselves. ganglion cell apoptosis is bax-dependent  <cit>  and leads to the activation of caspases  <cit>  in both conditions. in addition, ganglion cells undergo early losses of gene expression before the activation of detectable ganglion cell loss  <cit>  after crush and in glaucoma. in view of the similarities of the cell death pathways activated by both conditions, we predict that the susceptibility alleles that affect ganglion cell death after crush will also affect ganglion cell loss in glaucoma. a critical test of this hypothesis is to first identify the loci that affect the crush phenotype and then assess how the same gene affect ganglion cell loss in glaucoma. for example, dba/2j mice naturally develop a form of secondary chronic inherited glaucoma  <cit> . although dba/2j mice are the most resistant strain assayed in our study, they still exhibit variable susceptibility to elevated iop as they age, which eventually leads to ganglion cell loss. breeding the susceptibility alleles inherent in balb/cbyj mice onto the dba/2j background, however, could result in mice that develop a more aggressive form of glaucoma. thus, in response to the same levels of elevated iop, these modified mice may develop earlier onset of ganglion cell loss or perhaps an accelerated rate of retinal degeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our examination of ganglion cell loss after optic nerve crush in inbred mice indicates that genetic background influences the susceptibility of these cells. experiments using a reciprocal breeding strategy demonstrate that the resistance phenotype is inherited in a dominant fashion and involves relatively few loci. extending this observation to identify the genes at these loci, may help elucidate some of the alleles that contribute to susceptibility to ocular hypertension leading to glaucoma in humans.
