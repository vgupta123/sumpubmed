BACKGROUND
conventional antibodies are complex molecules that consist of heavy and light chains. they contain an n-linked oligosaccharide attached to the second heavy-chain constant domain , which is essential for antibody functionality. isolated heavy and light chains can retain antigen-binding specificity, but very frequently their affinity and solubility are reduced. antibody production in heterologous expression systems is often cumbersome  <cit> . in this regard, a major scientific breakthrough was the discovery of heavy-chain antibodies. these are produced by camelids  and are functional antibodies devoid of light chains  <cit> . camelid heavy-chain antibodies also lack the ch <dig> domain, which interacts with the light chain in conventional antibodies. their single n-terminal domain  binds antigen without requiring domain pairing and it is the smallest domain with antigen-binding properties.

the use of vhhs in biotechnology has increased considerably thanks to their ease of manipulation, high affinity and stability and the well-established methods to generate antigen-specific vhh antibody libraries. furthermore, some of these molecules remain functional after incubation at high temperature. this characteristic may be attributed to their efficient refolding after chemical or thermal denaturalization, which may occur as a result of increased hydrophilicity in their amino acid sequence  <cit> . because of their small size  and the capacity of the extended cdr <dig> loop to penetrate very small sites, vhhs can also recognize active enzymatic sites  <cit> . thus vhhs not only pass the renal filter, thus resulting in rapid blood clearance , but also show rapid tissue penetration.

vhh antibody fragments are emerging as new versatile reagents for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases, including rotavirus-induced diarrhea  <cit> . rotavirus  is estimated to cause  <dig> million episodes of gastroenteritis per year, resulting in  <dig>  deaths in children under 5 years of age, and children in developing countries account for 82% of the deaths caused by this disease  <cit> . currently, there are two licensed vaccines against rv-induced diarrhea in infants; however, no specific therapy is yet available.

rvs are classified into seven groups  on the basis of the antigenic variation of the inner capsid protein vp <dig>  group a  being the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in infants. group a rvs are further classified into p and g genotypes/serotypes on the basis of the genetic and antigenic variation of the outer layer proteins vp <dig> and vp <dig>  both inducing the neutralizing antibodies associated with protection. this neutralization is due to the inhibition of virus binding to integrins  <cit> . despite the different g and p serotypes, vp <dig> is a strongly conserved protein among all group a rvs . this structural virus protein is highly immunogenic and constitutes the target antigen of most immunodiagnostic tests for group a rv detection.

conventional antibodies directed to this protein do not show neutralizing activity in vitro <cit> . however, inhibition of rv replication by a non-neutralizing rv vp6-specific iga has been described  <cit> . recently, it has also been demonstrated that vp6-specific vhhs produced in e. coli have broad rv neutralizing activity in vitro and their functionality was further confirmed by in vivo protection experiments in a neonatal mouse model  <cit> . the mechanism responsible for the broad neutralization of these single-domain antibodies in vitro, together with their protective properties in neonatal mice, is unknown. however, the effects of these antibodies could be related to their small size, which would allow a larger range of interactions with the inner capsid protein vp <dig> than conventional antibodies.

to date, vhhs have been produced in e. coli, yeast, plants and mammalian cells  <cit> , and there is only one example of vhh production in filamentous fungi  <cit> . it is important to highlight that for oral therapy a pre-requisite is the elimination of any living organism that could contaminate or replicate in the intestinal tract of patients, as well as the removal of any potential contaminating toxin that may aggravate the diarrhea. thus the production of these antibodies in bacteria could introduce some of the mentioned undesirable factors into the final product, even after several purification steps. discarding bacteria fermentation for antibody production removes the option of one of the most cost-efficient production systems available. therefore the only possibility to apply the above mentioned vp6-specific vhhs as a preventive or therapeutic strategy to control rv a in developing countries is to minimize their production costs. to achieve this goal, it is critical to explore alternative expression platforms that present less risk in terms of undesirable contaminants of the final products, considering the disease and administration route used. it is noteworthy that n-glycosylation of some vhhs contributes to toxin- and virus-neutralizing capacity  <cit> . the use of eukaryotic expression systems would therefore be advantageous for vhh production. the therapeutic concept of protective single-domain antibodies against rv a could be envisaged not only as a conventional medicament but also as an additive to elaborate a functional food able to reduce the incidence or severity of severe rv a diarrhea, especially in risk populations . therefore, the choice of an efficient heterologous expression system, involving high production efficiency or downstream processing, would represent a step towards the clinical application of vhhs.

the baculovirus expression vector system  is a widely used method to efficiently produce functional recombinant proteins, including any kind of antibodies. however, the production cost of bevs is relatively high when insect cells lines are used because the cell culture characteristics and linear scalability is complex for therapeutic proteins. in addition, the investment in bioreactors is potentially too high when the molecule to be developed is directed mainly at the markets of developing countries and will probably be used at high therapeutic doses administered by the oral route. an economically efficient alternative to insect cell cultures is the use of insects as living biofactories. numerous studies have demonstrated the cost-efficiency and the scalability of production of many recombinant proteins, which include diagnostic reagents  <cit> , vaccines  <cit>  and therapeutic molecules  <cit> , among others. the most used insect larvae for such purposes is the natural host of autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus , the lepidopter trichoplusia ni . recombinant protein production by the combination of recombinant baculovirus and this insect larva has been denominated improved baculovirus expression system . this technology represents one of the best production alternatives based on baculovirus vectors. baculovirus-infected larvae produce high yields of recombinant protein  at a reduced cost  <cit>  and working in non-sterile conditions. these larvae provide a final product with high biosafety standards as animal compounds are not involved in the production process and neither does cross-infection in mammals occur between pathogens infecting this lepidopter  <cit> .

here we successfully applied ibes® technology to express two vhh antibodies, 2kd <dig> and 3b <dig>  that show neutralizing and protective activity against various strains of rv a  <cit> . using low recombinant baculovirus doses to express the vhhs, we produced  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ g of insect biomass of recombinant 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig>  respectively . the larva-derived antibodies were fully functional and they neutralized the virus in vitro and in vivo, in a similar way as the e. coli-derived molecules did. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that insects have been used as living biofactories to produce a vhh molecule.

RESULTS
analysis of vhh expression in t. larvae
the capacity of 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig> vhh antibodies to recognize and neutralize rvs belonging to distinct subgroups and serotypes  in vitro and in vivo has been addressed previously  <cit> . to study the feasibility of expressing these potential therapeutic molecules against rv a using the ibes® technology, we generated and characterized two recombinant baculoviruses expressing these antibodies . the encoding genes for the antibodies were cloned in phase with the mellitin signal peptide to increase productivity, following previous descriptions in the literature. we inoculated groups of  <dig> fifth instar larvae with a range of doses of each recombinant baculovirus inoculum. the optimal dose selected for vhh production was  <dig>  plaque forming units per larvae  for 3b <dig> while for 2kd <dig> it was  <dig>  pfu/larva. the larva-derived recombinant antibodies were detected in tsp fractions obtained from infected larvae by coomassie blue staining of sds-page gels and showed the expected electrophoretic mobility . both vhhs expressed in larvae were also recognized specifically by an anti-vhh polyclonal antibody in a western blot .

capillary electrophoresis using the experion system  was used to quantify in triplicate the recombinant vhhs produced in optimal conditions in the tsp fractions obtained from larva infected with each recombinant baculovirus. the percentages of recombinant vhhs produced were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for 2kd <dig> and 3b <dig> respectively . recombinant vhhs were purified by affinity chromatography  and recovery rates of around 50% were achieved for both molecules.

in vitro functionality of the larva-derived vhhs
we first analyzed the recognition of the vp <dig> protein in the context of the rv a particles obtained in infected cell cultures. virus supernatant containing  <dig> ffu/ml from ma- <dig> cells infected with the bovine rv indiana  was used as antigen in an elisa. larva-derived vhhs  recognized the viral particles in a similar way to the purified 2kd <dig> vhh expressed in e. coli, which was used as a positive control .

in order to evaluate the neutralization activity of larva-derived vhhs, recombinant single-domain antibodies were analyzed in a vn test using serial four-fold dilutions of antibodies and the wa human rv strain . similar patterns of cell protection were obtained along the serial dilutions tested for all the vhhs analyzed. the two vhhs purified from larvae, 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig>  neutralized more than 90% of rv infection in vitro at similar concentrations to their e. coli counterparts  .

when raw extracts from larvae containing 3b <dig> or 2kd <dig> were assayed in vn assays, low concentrations of 2 μg/ml or  <dig>  μg/ml of antibody, respectively, were also required to neutralize 90% of virus infectivity. this observation suggests that other components of the insect included in the samples assayed did not interfere with the functionality of the vhhs .

in vivo functionality of larva-derived vhhs
for a further demonstration of the functionality of vhhs produced in larva, we performed in vivo protection experiments against rv a in newborn mice. pups received a single intragastric dose of 100 μg of each purified vhh  daily for 5 days. on the second day of vhh administration, animals were challenged with the murine rv strain ecw, which produced diarrhea in 100% of the untreated control mice. challenged pups developed rv-associated diarrhea 48 h post challenge . non-challenged animals fed tsp from control infected larvae developed no clinical sign during the experiment, thus indicating that the components of the larvae extracts did not induce diarrhea per se. at the time point corresponding to the onset of diarrhea, the rate of diarrhea among groups was statistically analyzed. all groups of mice treated with neutralizing vhhs  showed significantly higher protection rates against rv-associated diarrhea than the control groups , which presented severe diarrhea at  <dig> hpc in 100% of pups . specifically, the pups treated with purified 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig> vhhs showed significantly higher protection rates against diarrhea  than the control groups  at  <dig> hpc. in addition, the protective effect was maintained until the end of the experiment , where 33% of the treated mice in each group remained without diarrhea .

to evaluate the protective effect of the vhh treatment against viral shedding, at the end of the in vivo protection assays  all pups were euthanized and intestine homogenates were checked by elisa. results were statistically analyzed. similarly to what was observed for clinical signs, all groups of pups fed neutralizing vhhs showed significantly lower rates of viral shedding than the control groups . in agreement with the diarrhea protection, only 53% of pups fed purified 3b <dig> vhh did not show viral shedding at  <dig> hpc, while pups fed the purified 2kd <dig> vhh showed a significant reduction rate of viral shedding compared with the control groups as well as with 3b <dig>  where only 6%  were positive for rv a by elisa .

in a second experiment, we examined whether there was a synergistic protective effect of both larva-derived purified 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig>  interestingly, 60%  of the pups treated with 50 μg/dose of each vhh  were fully protected against diarrhea at  <dig> and  <dig> hpc and 50%  remained without any clinical sign at  <dig> hpc . regarding viral shedding, only 30% of the animals  presented virus in intestine samples, showing an intermediate rate of viral shedding between pups fed each vhh alone  but still representing a significant reduction compared with the control groups .,

with the aim to determine whether raw material from larvae containing the 3b <dig> or 2kd <dig> antibodies was also protective in mice, two groups of pups were treated with these extracts, which held identical amounts of vhhs as tested in the previous experiment using purified antibodies. in this experiment, the number of pups protected at  <dig> hpc was lower . all animals presented clinical signs of diarrhea at later times post infection . in addition, both groups showed a statistically significant reduction of viral shedding at  <dig> hpc, with protection rates of  <dig> %  for 3b <dig> and  <dig> %  for 2kd <dig> .

discussion
many novel therapeutic molecules are based on antibodies directed to molecular targets, including infectious pathogens. these therapeutic antibodies can be produced in a number of ways while maintaining their antigen affinity properties. however, conventional antibodies are frequently difficult to produce because of their complex structure. short versions, such as single-chain antibodies, comprising the antibody-binding domains, lose some antibody properties and present reduced affinity and stability. single-domain antibodies produced by camelidae have very interesting properties compared to classical mammalian antibodies as they have only one variable region , with a reduced size, and show greater stability under a range of conditions . by a mechanism that is not fully elucidated and probably related to the small size of 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig>  the interaction of these antibodies with their target antigen  in rv particles differs to that of conventional immunoglobulins. thus, 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig> produce broad neutralization activity in vitro and are protective against diarrhea and viral shedding in a neonatal mouse model. these properties confer these antibodies a high potential therapeutic value. experiments to demonstrate the molecular basis of this mechanism of interaction are currently under way.

monoclonal antibodies are crucial in biopharmaceutical development and account for 42% of the total market of biologics. the annual growth of market requirements is estimated to increase to as much as  <dig> tons of therapeutic antibodies per year in  <dig>  this value would correspond to an annual growth rate of 37%  <cit> . this scenario has driven pharmaceutical companies to identify novel production alternatives to conventional fermentation technologies that facilitate speed of development and production scale-up at reduced costs. in the last 15 years, living biofactories such as plants, transgenic mammalians and insects have been adapted to produce recombinant proteins of all kinds, providing excellent results. today, some of these methodologies represent true alternatives to the fermentation of bacteria, yeast, and mammalian or insect cells.

insect larvae frequently scale up the recombinant protein production mediated by baculovirus vectors to levels of grams/l or hundreds of grams/l instead of tens of milligrams/l usually obtained in insect cells under fermentation. this technology dramatically reduces the production costs and fixed investments while also offering other advantages over classical insect cell fermentation approaches. first, insects are complex organisms that contain multiple cell types in perfect physiological conditions for productivity. complexity frequently increases productivity in any expression system. second, the scale-up of production based on insects  is unlimited and fast. tons of silk thread, composed by two proteins, are produced by a lepidopter every year and companies using insects to produce baculoviruses as biopesticides generate millions of infected insects in short periods of time by simple procedures. third, given the flexibility of baculovirus vectors, the development times implied by use of insects as living biofactories is very short when compared to the generation of productive transgenic mammalian cell clones.

the first descriptions of insect larvae use as living biofactories emerged in the early ‘90s  <cit>  and several companies in europe, usa and asia currently exploit this technology using trichoplusia ni or bombyx mori lepidopters with their respective baculovirus vectors. various kinds of protein have been successfully expressed in larvae, including diagnostic reagents  <cit> , vaccines  <cit> , therapeutic proteins  <cit> , enzymes  <cit> , and conventional complete or fragmented antibodies  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description that evaluates the efficiency of insects as living biofactories to express recombinant single-domain antibodies  derived from llama. our results demonstrate that insects are an efficient alternative to produce fully functional vhhs, which, in this case, can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. the antibodies 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig> are directed to unknown epitopes within the vp <dig> inner capsid protein, which is highly immunogenic and conserved among all group a rvs, including several subgroup specificities, various g/p-type combinations, and distinct species of origin, as previously demonstrated  <cit> .

these vhh molecules were previously generated functionally in e. coli. however, the use of insect host cells to produce vhhs would provide further advantages, such as the possibility to make posttranslational modifications, including the formation of disulphide bonds  <cit> . in this case, llama vhhs, which have an extended cdr <dig> that is often stabilized by an additional disulphide bond with a cysteine residue in cdr <dig>  <cit> , would be more efficiently produced.

the vhhs expressed in this study were cloned transcriptionally in phase with the signal peptide of honey bee mellitin. the incorporation of this signal peptide to the construct increased the expression yields, as previously reported with other proteins in the baculovirus expression system  <cit> , in comparison to the use the kdel er retention sequence . this signal peptide would allow the glycosylation of the protein. although an anomalous migration in sds-page was observed in the vhh 3b <dig>  this characteristic does not seem to be caused by this modification more than by another post-transductional modification since no glycosylation was detected when using the glycopro detection kit  .

the binding capacity of the larva-derived 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig> vhhs was compared in a sandwich elisa with the same antibodies expressed in e. coli. the binding behavior was similar in all cases with respect to the rv viral particles . in addition, both molecules neutralized group a rv strain wa  when they were incubated with the virus . the capacity of the monomeric vhh to present neutralizing activity could be related to the small size of these molecules  <cit> ; however, research into the mechanism behind the rv virus neutralization is still underway.

furthermore, the intragastric administration of the vhh 3b <dig> or 2kd <dig> in a neonatal mouse model exerted a protective effect against rv a-induced diarrhea caused by a highly infectious murine rv, ecw. fifty-three percent of the pups treated with purified 3b <dig> were protected after  <dig> hpc and at  <dig> hpc about 35% of the animals were still protected, and none of these protected animals presented viral excretion. with the purified 2kd <dig>  61% of the animals were protected against diarrhea at  <dig> hpc and only one pup showed viral shedding  <dig> hpc, resulting in the group with the highest protection rates against rv infection and disease. using non-purified larvae crude extracts containing the vhhs object of this study , protection levels were lower compared with their purified counterparts. however,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the animals presented no viral excretion at  <dig> hpc by elisa when treated with 3b <dig> tsp or 2kd <dig> tsp, respectively . these results were very similar to those previously obtained when using the same vhhs expressed in e. coli <cit> . the most interesting protective results were obtained when the 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig> vhhs were combined, since 60% of the animals remained protected at  <dig> hpc and 50% after  <dig> hpc. viral shedding was also dramatically reduced to 30% in this group . our results encourage us to continue to evaluate the protective value of these vhhs in a larger animal model of rv infection and disease that more closely resembled the physiology of human infants. experiments with the larva-derived vhhs described here in gnotobiotic pigs are in course.

in conclusion, the monovalent vhhs were efficiently expressed in larvae and presented the same functionality as those expressed in e. coli, showing polyreactive properties against several rv strains , wa  and ecw) both in elisa and vn. these properties were shown to be associated with protection in a neonatal mouse model. our results open up the possibility of using insects as living biofactories for the cost-efficient production of these and other vhhs to be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, thereby eliminating concerns regarding the use of bacterial or mammalian cells.

CONCLUSIONS
control or therapeutic molecules against severe infant diarrhea produced by rotavirus a are of tremendous interest due to the number of infection episodes per year , mainly in children in developing countries. two vhhs, named 3b <dig> and 2kd <dig>  specific for the inner capsid protein vp <dig> of group a rotavirus have been previously characterized as protective in a rotavirus infection mouse model. a cost-efficient production is a prerequisite to apply these single-domain antibodies as a preventive or therapeutic strategy to control rotavirus a infections in developing countries. in this work we have modelized the expression of the above mentioned vhhs by the improved baculovirus expression system . this technology uses a baculovirus expression vector in combination with trichoplusia ni larvae as living biofactories. the reached expression levels of vhhs represented up to 257 mg/l of protein extract after insect processing. the larva-derived antibodies were fully functional when tested in vitro and in vivo, neutralizing group a rotaviruses and protecting offspring mice against rotavirus-induced diarrhea. the ibes® technology has the potential to eliminate many concerns regarding the use of bacterial or mammalian cells, and to our knowledge, this is the first time that insects have been used as living biofactories to produce a vhh molecule.
