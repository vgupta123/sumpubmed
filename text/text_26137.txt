BACKGROUND
rusts are among the most important diseases of legumes  <cit>  and grass pea  is not an exception  <cit> . rusts are caused by biotrophic fungi that keep infected host cells alive for their development. they form elaborate intracellular accommodation structures called haustoria, which maintain an intimate contact between fungal and plant cells over a prolonged period of time  <cit> .

rust in lathyrus spp. is caused by uromyces pisi  wint and u. viciae-fabae  j. schröt  <cit> , but and in addition to lathyrus, u. pisi infects a broad range of other legumes too  <cit> . plants have developed multifaceted defence responses, many of which are induced only upon pathogen attack. these responses may include induction of pathogenesis related  genes, the production of secondary metabolites , as well as the reinforcement of cell walls  <cit> . associated with these responses may be the production of reactive oxygen species  and the induction of localized cell death   <cit> . the induction of this basal plant defence machinery occurs upon the recognition of conserved molecules which are present in a variety of microbial species, but absent in the host. these pathogen associated molecular patterns  are molecular components highly conserved within a class of microbes, where they have essential functions for their fitness or survival  <cit> . these include, for example, fungal chitin, β-glucan and ergosterol. the specific virulence factors of the pathogen, known as fungal effectors, are recognized by corresponding resistance  genes of the host plant. both rust-causing pathogens of lathyrus are able to efficiently overcome r-gene based resistance  <cit> . to date, most fungal effectors identified are lineage-specific small secreted proteins  of unknown function  <cit> . the u. viciae-fabae rust transferred protein  <dig>  was the first fungal effector visualized in the host cytoplasm and nucleus after in planta secretion by the rust fungus  <cit> . rtp <dig> belongs to a family of cysteine protease inhibitors that are conserved in the rust species   <cit> .

gene-for-gene resistance is associated with the activation of, for instance, the salicylic acid -dependent signalling pathway, leading to expression of defence-related genes like pr <dig>  the production of ros and finally to programmed cell death  <cit> . other phytohormones involved in plant/pathogen interaction are ethylene  and jasmonates . plant defence responses appear specifically adapted to the attacking pathogen, with sa-dependent defences acting mainly against biotrophs, and ja- and et-dependent responses acting mainly against necrotrophs  <cit> .

grass pea is a diploid species  with a genome size of approx.  <dig>  gbp  <cit> . although grass pea is primarily self-pollinated, a  <dig> to 36% outcrossing rate was reported, depending on location and genotype  <cit> . outcrossing is mainly driven by pollinators, and therefore can be minimized when grown in isolation  <cit> . there is a great potential for the expansion of grass pea in dry areas and zones that are becoming more drought-prone as a result of climate change  <cit> . partial resistance to u. pisi has been reported in grass pea as a clear example of prehaustorial resistance, with no associated necrosis. this resistance is due to restriction of haustoria formation accompanied by frequent early abortion of the colonies, reduction in the number of haustoria per colony and decreased intercellular growth of infecting hyphae  <cit> . though prehaustorial resistance is typical for non-hosts, it has also been implicated in host partial resistance  <cit>  and is common in resistance of major cool season grain legumes against rusts  <cit> . additionally, resistant lathyrus genotypes may serve as a source of new and useful genetic traits in the breeding of related major legume crops such as peas, lentils and vetches. cross-incompatibility has been reported between pea and l. sativus, but successful fusion of pisum sativum and l. sativus protoplasts  <cit>  creates new possibilities for gene transfer between these species. however, the slow progress in understanding the genetic control of important traits, such as disease resistance, in lathyrus species hampered the development of modern cultivars or the introgression of their interesting traits into related species.

in economically important warm season legumes such as common bean and soybean, complete monogenically controlled resistances to rusts and associated rust resistance genes have been described together with closely linked markers for use in marker assisted backcrossing  <cit> . by contrast, most rust resistances described so far in cool season food legumes are incomplete in nature and the genetic basis of resistance is largely unknown. although qtl mapping studies confirmed the polygenic control of resistance as e.g. in pea  <cit> , faba bean  <cit>  and chickpea  <cit> , no markers suitable for marker assisted selection  are available yet.

genomic resources for grass pea are still scarce , and the two linkage maps existing for grass pea do not contain sufficiently informative markers to bridge between them  <cit> .

the advent of next-generation sequencing  technologies was an important breakthrough enabling the sensitive and quantitative high-throughput transcriptome analysis referred to as rna-seq  <cit> . rna-seq discriminated between microbial and host transcriptomes, during plant-microbe interactions, using original or phylogenetically related genomes as a reference for transcript annotation  <cit> . rna-seq gene expression patterns provided also information on complex regulatory networks and on variations in expressed genes, such as snps and ssrs, in an increasing number of non-model plants  <cit>  and thus may be well suited to overcome the bottleneck of lacking genomic resources in lathyrus.

here we employed rna-seq to study the response of l. sativus to u. pisi infection. we used mapman and metabolic pathway analyses to interpret the results and assessed allelic diversity in transcripts as a source for genic markers for future  mapping studies. in addition, the expression of a set of selected genes was measured by qrt-pcr to validate the rna-seq results.

to our knowledge, this is the first study on the global expression profiling of genes in grass pea/pathogen interaction using ngs. our results will assist the elucidation of pathways and genes associated with resistance to rust in grass pea and related species. this approach may represent one of the initial steps towards the development of effective strategies for resistance breeding against such a quickly evolving pathogen.

RESULTS
contigs from the rna-seq transcriptomes of resistant and susceptible l. sativus genotypes
the rna-seq libraries from control and inoculated leafs from the resistant genotype bge <dig> were united prior to assembly to generate a comprehensive data set enabling the generation of contigs of maximum length. they included  <dig> , <dig> reads which were assembled into  <dig>  contigs, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, with a mean contig length of 544 bp. the respective united library from the susceptible genotype bge <dig> comprised  <dig> , <dig> reads which assembled in  <dig>  contigs, with a size range of  <dig> to  <dig>  bp and a mean contig length of 524 bp.

a reference assembly using both genotypes and treatments assembled in  <dig>  contigs, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, with a mean contig length of 501 bp. the mapping and quantification of both genotypes’ libraries to the reference assembly allowed the analysis of their differential expression in response to u. pisi infection.  <dig>  contigs were unique to the resistant and  <dig>  contigs were unique to the susceptible genotype.

redundancy of the reference assembly was checked using the clustering algorithm uclust, identifying only  <dig>  transcripts with identity higher than 95%.

this transcriptome shotgun assembly project has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession gbss <dig>  the version described in this paper is the first version, gbss <dig> 

rna-seq validation by quantitative rt-pcr assay
to validate the rna-seq results, expression levels of a set of  <dig> selected genes were analysed by qrt-pcr. genes were selected by their level of expression and transcript count, in order to represent a broad range of expression profiles. further, the number of their transcripts differed between inoculated and control samples by log <dig> ratios ranging from − <dig>  to  <dig>  at q-values <  <dig> . their read count numbers were generally higher than  <dig>  with exception of contig a45744; <dig>  “mitochondrial chaperone bcs1”, with  <dig> counts in the resistant control and  <dig> counts in the resistant inoculated line, and contig a32859; <dig> “seed maturation protein”, with  <dig> counts in the susceptible inoculated line and  <dig> counts in the resistant inoculated line . the best housekeeping genes for normalization suggested by the genorm software were, for the resistant genotype samples, “β-tubulin”  and “photosystem i p <dig> apoprotein a2” , and “o-methyltransferase” , for the susceptible genotype. a good correlation  was observed between the log <dig> fold changes measured by rna-seq and qrt-pcr .table  <dig>

annotation
from the  <dig>  contigs detected in all libraries,  <dig>   contigs could be matched via blast to entries in plant databases and  <dig>  matched only to fungal databases. the latter contigs were present only in the inoculated libraries. also,  <dig>  contigs were absent in control samples and found exclusively in fungal databases, or with a higher bit-score in fungal databases than in plant databases and thus, most probably correspond to u. pisi sequences.

as indicated in figure  <dig>  blast produced hits mainly to other legume species with frequencies in the order medicago truncatula , glycine max , p. sativum  and lotus japonicus . vitis vinifera , populus trichocarpa  and the model arabidopsis thaliana  were the best matching non-legume species. blast hits from l. sativus comprised only  <dig> %  of the total illustrating the scarcity of lathyrus entries in the data bases.figure  <dig>

from the  <dig>  contigs that were absent in control samples and found exclusively in fungal databases, or with a higher bit-score in fungal databases,  <dig> contigs from the  <dig> accessions described in uniprotkb/swiss-prot and uniprotkb/trembl as u. viciae-fabae, were identified . none of these  <dig> contigs were significantly differentially expressed between the two inoculated genotypes. for example, among the eight contigs out of the  <dig> without a plant database hit, five were homologous to “invertase 1”, and the three others to “rust transferred protein – rtp1”, “amino acid transporter” and “putative permease”. six other contigs absent in control samples and found exclusively in fungal databases or with a higher bit-score in fungal databases, were homologous to housekeeping genes that can be found throughout different kingdoms  atpase”.

functional annotation of the contigs via mercator and mapman, depicted in figure  <dig>  grouped  <dig> % of them into  <dig> main functional categories, of which the categories “protein” , “rna” , “signalling” , “transport”  and “stress”  were most crowded. a total of  <dig> % could not be assigned to any functional category.figure  <dig> 
percentage of contigs assigned in each main functional category.




analysis of functional categories, within each expression pattern group, identified differences among the functions present within each group. comparisons were also performed among the different expression profiles in each category . transcripts included in the functional categories “stress” and “protein” were present at a higher percentage in up-regulated expression pattern groups , while the functional category “cell” was present at higher percentage in down-regulated expression pattern groups . the most prominent functional category in group c contigs up-regulated in both genotypes, with a higher expression in the resistant genotype was “cell wall”. “lipid metabolism” and “dna” were also over-represented. however, also the down-regulated groups f, g, and h contained a considerable number of contigs from the “cell wall” category. in group b, joining contigs up-regulated in both genotypes with a higher expression in the susceptible genotype, the categories “secondary metabolism” and “hormone metabolism” were over-represented. interestingly, the functional category “signalling” was over-represented in contigs up- regulated only in the susceptible genotype, as in group d.figure  <dig> 
percentage of contigs assigned in each functional category for each expression pattern group. a - contigs up-regulated in both resistant and susceptible genotypes similarly; b - contigs up-regulated in both genotypes, with a higher expression in the susceptible genotype; c - contigs up-regulated in both genotypes, with a higher expression in the resistant genotype; d - contigs up-regulated only in the susceptible genotype; e - contigs up-regulated only in the resistant genotype; f - contigs down-regulated in both resistant and susceptible genotypes similarly; g - contigs down-regulated only in the susceptible genotype; h - contigs down-regulated only in the resistant genotype.



biotic stress related proteins
in order to restrict the number of analysed contigs to the ones probably more directly related to resistance, we focused mostly on contigs up-regulated at a higher ratio, or exclusively, in the resistant genotype , contigs exclusively down-regulated in the susceptible genotype  and contigs exclusively down-regulated in the resistant genotype .

from the subcategory “stress.biotic”, two contigs in group e corresponded to the well- studied mildew resistance locus o  gene which was first identified in barley, conferring resistance to powdery mildew  <cit> . also, from a total of  <dig> “mlo-like” contigs,  <dig> were differentially expressed. one of these was down-regulated in the resistant genotype . these might be related to mlo susceptibility genes, as reported by several previous studies  <cit> . interestingly, in the susceptible genotype, one “predicted: beta glucosidase 12-like”, identified by mercator as “penetration 2”, required for mlo-mediated resistance and belonging to the functional category “secondary metabolism”, was down-regulated . group g also contained one “acidic endochitinase” and two lrr proteins, one tir-nbs-lrr and one containing lrr and nb-arc domains. in group c, a pathogenesis related protein  <dig>  contig was identified.

the subcategory “stress.abiotic” contained, i.a., genes involved in response to heat that also respond to biotic stresses. for example, in group c and e, we identified one “dnaj heat shock protein” in both groups, three “heat shock protein  <dig> family”  and one “ <dig>  kda class  <dig> heat shock protein” . group g, however, contained one “dnaj homolog subfamily b member” and one “double clp-n motif-containing p-loop nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases superfamily protein”.

several contigs related to secondary metabolism were exclusively up-regulated in the resistant genotype . these comprised a “reticuline oxidase-like protein” involved in alkaloid biosynthesis, an “isoflavone 2’hydroxylase”, functioning in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway, a “dihydroflavonol-4-reductase”, with roles in the flavonoid and brassinosteroid metabolic pathway and an “amp-dependent coa ligase”, acting in the ja and lignin biosynthesis pathways. in group g,  <dig> contigs were related to secondary metabolism including four involved in the flavonoid pathway, two in the isoprenoid/terpenoid pathway and one “wax 2-like” involved in wax biosynthesis.

pti  relies on an efficient signalling network in order to control the infection  <cit> . receptor kinases are important for the plant’s pathogen recognition and their expression may be constitutively expressed or up-regulated in resistant genotypes or down-regulated in susceptible genotypes in response to effectors from the pathogen. receptor kinases and kinases exclusively up-regulated in the resistant genotype and contained in group e may be part of such signalling cascades. these included one protein kinase with thaumatin  domain, six “duf 26”, one “crinkly4”, one “feronia receptor like kinase”, and also a map kinase “mapkkk5” and a g-protein “zinc finger  family protein”. in contrast, the down-regulation of such transcripts in the susceptible genotype  may contribute to susceptibility. here we identified three “duf 26”, three lrr , two g-proteins , two map kinases  and three genes involved in calcium signalling . interestingly, calmodulin also plays a role in the mlo response, where the lack of a calmodulin binding site decreases its defence response  <cit> .

the “cell wall” category contained seven cellulose synthase contigs: one in group e “irregular xylem  <dig> ” and four in group c . in group g, we identified two cellulose synthase “irx14” and two “pectinesterase inhibitor” contigs.

from the genes normally associated with defence response, only one “endo-beta- <dig> 3-glucanase” was identified in group c, while two others “endo-beta- <dig> 3-glucanase” were detected in group g. also in group g, we identified two “peroxidase” and two “glutathione s-transferase” genes.

snps in resistance pathways
in the  <dig>  contigs present in both the susceptible and the resistant genotypes, we identified  <dig>  contigs containing single nucleotide polymorphisms  discriminating between their respective alleles. the number of snps in functional  categories varied considerably. the categories “rna regulation of transcription”  and “protein.degradation”  contained by far the most snps, followed by the protein-related categories “protein.postranslational modification”  and “protein.synthesis” . other categories including the most snp-containing contigs were “signalling.receptor kinases” , “protein.targeting”  and the stress related categories, “stress.biotic”  and “stress.abiotic”  .figure  <dig>

est-srr development
 <dig> est-ssr potential polymorphic markers between the two genotypes were designed. est-ssrs were identified by the phobos software  <cit> , using as search parameters, perfect ssrs with a repeat unit lenght of two to six nucleotides. polymorphisms between the resistant and susceptible genotypes were manually identified and flanked by primer pair using the primer <dig> software  <cit> . to validate the est-ssr sequences,  <dig> primer pairs were randomly selected for pcr amplification to confirm the presence of size polymorphism between the two accessions. pcr reactions were conducted twice in order to confirm the results. from the total  <dig> est-ssr tested,  <dig>  primer pairs successfully amplified polymorphic fragments between the two accessions.  <dig>  primer pairs amplified monomorphic fragments and  <dig>  produce a very complex pattern. the remaining  <dig>  primer pairs were not able to produce any fragments.

discussion
lathyrus spp. is a potential source of resistance to several pathogens  <cit>  and especially l. sativus provides resistance to several fungal and bacterial diseases  <cit> . however, the lack of genetic and/or genomic information was a barrier to further identify resistance-related genes and to use them in breeding.

in the present study we therefore attempted to improve this unfavourable situation by identifying ests and snps, potentially involved in resistance, that may be used in future smart breeding approaches. we describe for the first time a high-throughput transcriptome assembly of grass pea/pathogen interaction, using genotypes contrasting in response to rust infection, to unravel the involved partial resistance mechanism and associated resistant genes.

our study has identified a large number of differentially expressed genes corresponding to biological categories that are thought to be most relevant in grass pea response to rust. a limitation of our study is the fact that only a single pooled sample was investigated for each genotype and condition. although the biological variance could not be assessed in the bulked approach, the large number of individual samples in the pool is likely to level out many of possible outliers. nevertheless, the validation of twelve genes by rt-qpcr, using three biological replicates, provided a good correlation with rna-seq results.

another motive that could also be influencing our results is that we used different cdna synthesis primers, oligo for the rna-seq and poly for rt-qpcr, what might yield different quantities of poly-adenylated and non-adenylated transcripts.

our study was severely hampered by the low number of annotated sequences, which is due to the lack of a reference genomic sequence for lathyrus. nevertheless, we could annotate between 34% and 46% of differentially expressed contigs to hits in plant databases, depending on the genotype and the infection status of the plants. we further developed new gene-based molecular tools as e.g. expressed sequence tags, gene-based simple sequence repeats  and snp-based markers. moreover, we identified a number of u. pisi effectors in the infected tissues though the overall low number of observed fungal transcripts probably reflects the low quantity of fungal structures in early-infected leaves  <cit> . thus, our present study will help to overcome the problems we encountered in previous work, where the transfer of molecular markers from close related species had a very low rate of success  therefore, the present rna-seq libraries will boost the availability of specific est-ssrs and snp-based markers that will be equally important for future development of more effective grass pea resistance breeding approaches.

the high amplification rate of the developed est-ssrs validates the quality of the rna-seq data. the few primers that failed to produce amplification products or produced amplicons with an unexpected pattern may be caused by the location of the respective primers across splice regions or the presence of a large intron, since genomic regions are absent from cdna. in addition also primers could be derived from chimeric cdna clones  <cit> .

besides the novel markers, the deep insights into pathogenesis-related mechanisms provided by this study are of particular interest. the most interesting pathogenesis-related protein that we identified, the “mlo-like protein” is involved in signalling in response to biotic stress. mlo was described for the first time in barley, where it conferred partial resistance to powdery mildew by inducing the thickening of the cell wall at fungal penetration sites  <cit> . two “mlo-like” contigs were up-regulated exclusively in the resistant genotype , and perhaps related to this, also in group e and more strongly up-regulated in the resistant genotype , we identified cellulose biosynthesis genes. the exclusively resistance-up-regulated group e contained one “irregular xylem 3”  gene and three “irx1”. additionally, one “cellulose synthase 1”  was stronger up-regulated in the resistant genotype than in the susceptible one . consistent with the assumed importance of mlo signalling for rust resistance, some genes important for mlo function as e.g. “calmodulin”, involved in calcium signalling as a prerequisite for mlo function  <cit> , were down-regulated in the susceptible genotype . another gene involved in mlo resistance and down-regulated in the susceptible genotype, is the glycosyl hydrolase “penetration 2” gene  <cit> . since rust resistance in grass pea is of prehaustorial type we consider mlo as a candidate r-gene. in order to confirm this assumption, callose deposition, as a potentially durable resistance mechanism against rusts, should be further investigated in rust-resistant and susceptible grass pea genotypes. the down-regulation of several “mlo-like” contigs in response to infection in both, susceptible and resistant genotypes, does not necessarily contradict our assumption, since several mlo orthologs were demonstrated to function as susceptibility genes  <cit> .

plant responses to biotic stressors are, i.a., controlled by phytohormones as e.g. salicylic acid , abscisic acid , jasmonates  and ethylene . differences in expression of hormone-related genes of the susceptible and resistant genotype, in response to the pathogen, also occurred in our gene expression patterns. for example, plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens is mainly controlled by the sa pathway  <cit>  and the importance of sa in the induction of systemic acquired resistance in legumes against rust fungi has been reported  <cit> . in our study an inducer of the sa pathway, the “ethylene response factor 5”  gene, which at the same time inhibits the ja and et biosynthesis pathways  <cit> , was exclusively up-regulated in the resistance genotype , whereas two apetala2/ethylene responsive factor  transcription factor genes, important for the regulation of defence responses  <cit> , were down- regulated in the susceptible genotype .

aba regulates defence responses through its effects on callose deposition and production of ros intermediates  <cit> , activating also stomata closure as a barrier against pathogen infection  <cit> . in the resistant genotype, the transcript for “9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 2”, a key regulator of aba biosynthesis in response to drought  <cit> , and involved in the crosstalk between aba and sa signalling in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> , was up-regulated , whereas several transcripts engaged in aba, auxin and ja signalling, were down-regulated in the susceptible genotype . this is consistent with a susceptible response to a biotroph attack  <cit> .

the image emerging from the transcription profiles, of the resistant and susceptible genotype, further highlights that pathogenesis related  proteins are key players in lathyrus-rust interactions since several pr genes were mainly up-regulated in the resistant genotype, after inoculation. among these were two chitinases  involved in the degradation of the fungal cell wall  <cit>  and a thaumatin  gene, which causes an increase of the permeability of fungal membranes by pore-forming mechanisms  <cit> . in group e, we found a “pathogenesis related protein 1”  and a “protein kinase-coding resistance protein”, a receptor kinase with a thaumatin domain , presumably involved in thaumatin signaling and described previously as delaying infection  <cit> . another important pr-gene, an “acidic endochitinase” , was down regulated exclusively in the susceptible genotype. genes involved in secondary metabolism were also detected. legumes utilize flavonoids, notably isoflavones and isoflavanones, for defence against pathogens and as signalling molecules, with a number of phenylpropanoids having antimicrobial activity and restricting pathogen growth and disease symptoms  <cit> . in group g, we identified a “reticuline oxidase-like protein”, up regulated in non- race-specific resistance to stripe rust in wheat  <cit> , an “isoflavone 2′-hydroxylase” from the isoflavonoid pathway  <cit>  and a “dihydroflavonol-4-reductase” catalysing the first enzymatic step in anthocyanin biosynthesis, in the flavonoid pathway  <cit> .

also, exclusively down regulated in the susceptible genotype, we found some genes important for defence response within the miscellaneous category, like “endo-beta- <dig> 3-glucanase”, “glutathione s-transferase”  and “peroxidase”. in plants, beta-glycosidases serve a number of diverse and important functions, including bioactivation of defence compounds, cell wall degradation in endosperm during seed germination, activation of phytohormones, and lignifications  <cit> . gsts are detoxification-related proteins, protecting cells from secondary metabolites produced in response to pathogen attack, including peroxidases  <cit> . finally, peroxidases function as resistance factors against invading fungi, inhibiting hyphal elongation, and when h2o <dig> is present, causing oxidative burst  <cit> .

effectors are expected to be excellent targets for the control of pathogens, but, unlike effectors from some other plant pathogens, relatively little is known about rust effectors  <cit> . in this study, several unigenes were identified in fungal databases. the most known rust effector identified was “rust transferred protein 1” . this effector aggregates into amyloid-like filaments in vitro  <cit> . immunoelectron microscopy localized this effector to the extrahaustorial matrix protuberances extending into the host cytoplasm, although the exact role for this protein remains to be discovered  <cit> . other uromyces effectors identified in this study were “succinate dehydrogenase”, “invertase” and “permease”. from the total potential rust transcripts identified, a selection of effector proteins could be used as probes to identify the target host proteins as a first step in the development of effector-driven legume breeding, maximizing the durability of resistance against the quickly evolving rust pathogens  <cit> .

from the de contigs obtained in the present study,  <dig>  presented snps between the resistant and the susceptible lines. the mapman software aided in the functional categorisation of snps, revealing that the categories “rna regulation of transcription”  and “protein.degradation”  contained by far the most snps. within these categories, ubiquitins were most polymorphic . ubiquitins tag proteins for proteasome degradation and play a central role in signalling pathways  <cit> . especially ubiquitin “e <dig> ring” and “scf f-box” contigs contained a large number of snps . e <dig> ring and scf f-box proteins are involved in several aspects of plant immunity ranging from pathogen recognition to both pti to effector-triggered immunity . from the differentially expressed contigs identified as containing snps, we found one e <dig> ring, “predicted: ring-h <dig> finger protein atl2-like”, down regulated in the susceptible genotype. four other functional categories, “rna.regulation of transcription” , “protein.postranslational modification” , “protein.synthesis”  and “signalling.receptor kinases” , also contained significant numbers of polymorphisms. especially the “signalling.receptor kinases” category may be of particular interest for further studies since receptor kinases recognize pathogen effectors and their rapid evolution, reflected by large numbers of polymorphisms, may represent plants adaptation to a rapidly changing spectrum of pathogens in the arms race between them and their hosts  <cit> .

the large number of snps that we identified will be instrumental for the development of linkage and high-throughput association mapping approaches and for the expansion of our previous diversity studies in lathyrus  <cit> .

our results provide an overview of gene expression profiles of contrasting l. sativus genotypes inoculated with rust, offering a valuable set of sequence data for candidate rust resistant gene discovery.

CONCLUSIONS
our transcriptome analysis provided comprehensive insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying prehaustorial rust resistance in l. sativus.

the differences in resistance between the two l. sativus genotypes investigated appear to be mainly due to the activation of the sa pathway and several pathogenesis related genes, including the ones regulated by mlo. the fastest-evolving pathways differentiating between the two genotypes are the general rna’s regulation of transcription, followed by the ubiquitin-26s proteasome system and having also as most mutated receptor-based signalling genes and biotic and abiotic stress related genes. the detected polymorphic snps will allow the development of new gene-based molecular tools. altogether,  <dig> genes were identified as potential resistance genes, prioritizing them as specific targets for future functional studies on grass pea/rust interactions. besides a plethora of pathogenesis-related host genes,  <dig>  transcripts, including putative effectors, were also identified for the rust fungus u. pisi. as a consequence of the newly developed wider array of genetic and genomic resources, future work will focus on high throughput mapping of the genetic basis of disease resistance in l. sativus and eventual comparative mapping with other legume species, contributing all to an improved exploitation of this under used highly potential legume species.
