BACKGROUND
for decades, human tissue samples obtained from surgical procedures have been routinely fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for long-term storage. consequently, most institutions have large paraffin-block archives that allow long-term follow up for all types of neoplasms, including rare tumors. these archives represent a valuable source for molecular studies. a major limitation for the use of such samples to study gene expression is three-fold: rna can degrade prior to formalin fixation; formalin fixation produces significant chemical modification of rna; and rna continues to fragment and degrade over time, even after dehydration and paraffin-embedding.

immediate freezing of fresh tissue samples preserves good quality rna for gene expression studies; however, this procedure is not routinely performed in most hospitals and there are few institutions worldwide that have large frozen-tissue banks associated with long term clinical followup. moreover, tumor samples accrued into a frozen tissue bank are inherently biased in their collection: such tumors must be sufficiently large and palpable in order for tissue to be excised and frozen for the bank  <cit> .

formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  samples are universally available and, with institutional review board/ethics committee approval, cancer samples can be linked to clinical and/or follow up information, often available through an institution's tumor registry. extracting rna from such samples has been a promising but problematic challenge. in addition to rna degradation concerns, formalin fixation creates cross-linking between nucleic acids and proteins and adds mono-methylol to amino groups for all four rna bases ; methylene bridging then occurs between neighboring bases , formed by condensation of amino bases and n-methylols  <cit> .

rupp and locker described the first successful rna extraction from ffpe samples in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, many protocols have been described  <cit> . there are currently multiple protocols commercially available. in most of these protocols the rna is extracted by spin column purification according to similar basic principles: deparaffinization, followed by cell disruption with heated proteinase k, which is capable of efficiently degrading proteins that were covalently cross-linked with each other and rna, thereby allowing more efficient rna extraction than achieved by use of chaotropic agents such as guanidinium chloride  <cit> . proteinase k incubation at high temperature  also removes part of the methylol additions induced by formalin fixation  <cit> . after proteinase k incubation, rna is isolated by alcohol precipitation and though use of salt guanidine thiocyanate in a spin column purification step  <cit> .

magnetic beads can also be utilized to isolate rna. in these protocols, nucleic acids are bonded to paramagnetic beads and isolated by a magnetic field. rna is isolated using an optimized buffer solution and later a dnase step. magnetic micro-beads can be prepared in a number of ways, but usually magnetically susceptible particles  are coated with synthetic or biological polymers with high affinity for nucleic acid. a magnet is applied to the side of the tube containing the magnetically-labeled sample mixture and the magnetically bound nucleic acid aggregates near the wall of the tube, allowing the unlabeled materials to be pipetted off and discarded. in addition to quickly separating magnetically-bound nucleic acid, this method does not create the shear forces generated by spin centrifugation that may lead to nucleic acid degradation  <cit> .

breast cancer tissue rna archived for one year is less degraded and has larger average molecular weight than rna archived for six and  <dig> years, suggesting that fragmentation of ffpe tissue continues even after specimens are dehydrated and embedded in paraffin  <cit> . many molecular techniques depend upon the quantity and quality of extracted rna in samples; translational studies that link molecular findings to clinical outcome require long term follow up. here we compare rna extraction protocols on a set of  <dig> ten year old ffpe breast cancer samples, testing spin column purification and magnetic bead-based technologies. using the same protocols, we compare our results with a second set of  <dig> recently archived breast cancer samples fixed and embedded in paraffin three to ten months prior to this study, that we designate "months old" samples. we also test rna fragment size in both sample groups using rt-pcr for the housekeeping gene g6pd.

RESULTS
in the set of ten year old samples , protocols  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> extracted rna with a minimum rin of  <dig>  in, respectively,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the  <dig> triplicate rna extraction procedures performed for each protocol. thus, the success rate for extracting biologically useful rna with protocols  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> was 62%, 62%, 83%, and 71%, respectively. when analyzed on a per sample basis, protocols 1– <dig> produced biologically useful rna in at least one of three extractions for, respectively,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig> cases in the set for a case success rate of, respectively, 86%, 100%, 93%, and 93%.

for the set of recently archived months old samples , protocols  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> extracted rna with a minimum rin of  <dig>  in, respectively,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the  <dig> rna extraction procedures performed for each protocol, giving a success rate for extracting biologically useful rna of 81%, 81%, 93%, and 83%, respectively. the case success rate was 100% for all four protocols; in other words, each protocol was able to extract rna with a rin ≥  <dig>  in at least one of the three attempts for every case in this set.

rt-pcr for the housekeeping gene glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  was performed using primers that targeted different fragment sizes of extracted rna. all samples from both one and ten year old sets successfully amplified  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp fragments of g6pd mrna. however, when primers targeting  <dig> bp fragments were tested, only six of  <dig>  months old ffpe samples and none of the ten year old samples demonstrated g6pd gene expression .

discussion
biopsies and surgical specimens are routinely fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. although the morphological integrity of the tissues is preserved, this procedure causes degradation of nucleic acids, predominantly rna. the development of protocols for rna extraction from these samples makes it possible to molecularly study long-term archived tissues, opening new perspectives for research and diagnostic investigation. soguero et al. were able to extract rna in more than  <dig> year-old archival liver tissue  <cit> . in breast cancer, long-term follow-up is important because the time to developing distant metastases and death can vary greatly, with both recurrence time and death extending beyond  <dig> years after surgery  <cit> . even patients with small tumors  may have 10-year relapse-free survival rates of less than 75% in the absence of systemic therapy  <cit> .

in addition to the impact of long-term storage, rna can also be degraded during the relative delay associated with putting the specimen in fixative following surgical excision and by prolonged fixation prior to paraffin embedding  <cit> . however, the greater challenge is that rna is chemically modified during formalin-fixation. fortunately, some of the alterations can be reversed by heating the rna to 50–55°c  <cit> . many attempts have been made to avoid these chemical modifications by proposing use of alternative fixatives such as bouin, carnoy, acetone, and alcohol as substitutes for formalin  <cit> . these fixatives, however, introduce tissue artifacts that can make microscopic histopathological analysis difficult or even impossible. moreover, these fixatives are not suitable for immunohistochemistry reactions, much more common in pathologic practice than gene expression analyses. finally, samples in most archives are already fixed in formalin. so, for retrospective studies, it is imperative to develop and/or refine protocols for rna extraction from ffpe.

the first step in rna extraction from ffpe samples is deparaffinization of the sections obtained from the paraffin blocks. when deparaffinization is incomplete, the extracted rna quality is worse  <cit> . in our work, in the set of 10-year-old samples, both the quantity and quality of rna extracted with the deparaffinization solution d-limonene  were higher than that obtained using xylene – also known as xylol, dimethylbenzene, or methyltoluene –  . due to other protocol differences, we cannot assess the impact of the deparaffinizing agent alone. it is worthy to note, however, that with the set of recently archived months old samples, the differences between protocols is smaller .

historically, rna integrity has been evaluated using agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. typically these gels show two peaks that correspond to ribosomal rna species 28s and 18s. according to this technique, a given rna sample is considered of good quality when the relation 28s:18s is equal to or higher than  <dig>  <cit> . the  <dig> bioanalyzer  is a microfluidic platform that uses electrophoretic separation of rna by molecular weight and provides laser-induced fluorescence measurements. using electropherogram curves,  <dig> rna samples from different sources and in different degrees of degradation were analyzed and an algorithm was created to determine rna integrity number . the rin for a given sample ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  from totally degraded rna to completely intact rna  <cit> . the rin method is superior to the 28s/18s ratio method for evaluating rna quality in breast cancer tissue  <cit> .

in frozen tissues, a rin ≥  <dig> provides more reproducible microarray results  <cit> . in ffpe samples, however, the rin is much lower because rna continues to degrade over time into small fragments. however, even low rin rna may still be used for some molecular analyses. fragments of only  <dig> bp have been shown to successfully amplify in 80% of real-time rt-pcr reactions; even with ffpe samples stored long-term  <cit> . rna extracted from 2- to 8-year-old ffpe produces rna of sufficient quality for microarray analysis in at least 24% of unselected ffpe samples  <cit> .

in frozen breast cancer tissue strand et al. suggested a minimum rin of  <dig> for gene expression analysis  <cit> . however, according to madabusi et al., rna with a rin as low as  <dig>  have been successfully used for gene expression analysis  <cit> . in our set of ten year old samples, using a minimum rin of  <dig>  as a threshold for rna quality, only protocol  <dig> extracted rna with a minimally acceptable quality for all  <dig> samples analyzed, 100% . protocol  <dig> extracted minimally acceptable rna in  <dig> of  <dig> cases, 86% . protocol  <dig> extracted minimally acceptable rna in  <dig> of  <dig> cases, 93% . protocol  <dig> extracted minimally acceptable rna in  <dig> of  <dig> cases, 93%  . in the set of recently archived months old samples , however, it was possible to extract rna with a minimally acceptable quality in all  <dig> samples analyzed with all four protocols. these data indicate that ten year old rna, and specifically rna that is biologically assayable, could be isolated from every sample by at least one and usually most of the protocols. these data indicate that, if a chosen protocol fails to extract rna from a given case in a first attempt, another attempt should be tried. however, in our series, if two initial attempts were unsuccessful, a third attempt using the same protocol was less likely to yield biologically usable results, especially for older samples. thus, we recommend switching rna isolation protocols after a second failed attempt. it would be unusual to completely exclude a case from molecular analysis because of insufficient or poor quality rna.

another important observation can be made in a careful analysis of tables  <dig> and  <dig>  there are discrepancies in both quantity and quality of extracted rna among individual cases for each of the protocols. for example, in sample  <dig>  with protocol  <dig>  test  <dig>  it was possible to extract  <dig>  pg/μl of rna. the quality of this rna, however, showed complete degradation, without a measurable rin. on the other hand, in sample  <dig>  with protocol  <dig>  test  <dig>  only  <dig>  pg/μl was extracted, but the rin was  <dig> . these data corroborate the observation made by chung et al. that quantity and quality are independent parameters in rna extraction  <cit> .

for all parameters analyzed, both for quantity and quality, protocol  <dig> did not perform as well as other protocols on our ten year old archived breast tissue, although it still produced sufficient rna from most samples . of the remaining three protocols , protocol  <dig> extracted slightly higher quality rna  than protocols  <dig> and  <dig> . however, protocol  <dig> extracted more rna than the other protocols  . protocol  <dig> used a total of  <dig> μm of tissue sections compared to  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm tissue sections used in protocols  <dig> and 3; it might be argued, therefore, that the reason protocol  <dig> extracted more rna than protocols  <dig> and  <dig> was higher input of tumor tissue. however, protocol  <dig> had the highest input of tissue,  <dig> μm, yet extracted less rna than the other protocols. thus, the quantity of extracted rna may or may not be related to tissue input. protocol  <dig>  which used only  <dig> μm of tissue input, may be a good choice when the amount of available tissue is scarce.

when we compared the results of the ten year old and recently archived months old samples in the extraction of biologically useful rna , there were no significant differences in quality of extracted rna between these different aged sample groups. the months old samples showed somewhat higher mean and median quantities of extracted rna, except for protocol  <dig>  which extracted slightly higher amounts of rna from the older tissues. all protocols, without exception, extracted biologically useful rna in a higher percentage of attempts for months old compared to ten year old samples, although biologically useful rna was still successfully extracted from each of the older samples a high percentage of the time.

our rt-pcr data indicated that biologically useful rna extracted from archivally stored ffpe tissue is suitable for rt-pcr analysis if the final product of amplification is designed to be  <dig> bp or less. we had a success rate of 100% for both the ten year old and more recently archived months old samples using primers for the housekeeping gene g6pd that amplified  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. successful amplification was achieved in none of our ten year old samples and in only 43% of our recently archived months old samples if the amplified fragment was  <dig> bp. this result is consistent with expected rna degradation over time. however, the lower quantity of extracted rna from ten year old samples that was used for the rt-pcr may also have contributed to the result. liu et al. <cit> , who cleverly designed the primers also used in this study, reported successful rt-pcr of 91% and 76% for  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp fragments of g6pd mrna, respectively, but only 5% for  <dig> bp fragments measured from archival histologic specimens of diverse tissues  between one and  <dig> years old. rt-pcr of genes other than g6pd or use of rna extracted from ffpe from other tissue sources could potentially produce different results.

all four protocols were time-consuming , but easy to use. we personally appreciated the speed and quantity of rna extracted using protocol  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, although the magnetic bead-based protocol extracted more rna than spin column-based protocols, all protocols were able to extract rna with a minimally acceptable quality from ten year old archived ffpe samples. although the quality of rna extracted from ten year old ffpe was similar to the rna extracted from recently archived months old samples, the quantity, consistency and success rate was higher in the months old group. the rna extracted from ffpe is suitable for rt-pcr analysis if the final product of amplification is up to  <dig> bp, with a success rate of 100% for both ten year old one and months old samples. if a chosen protocol fails to extract rna from a given case in a first attempt, another extraction and then an alternative protocol should be attempted before excluding this case from further molecular analysis.
