BACKGROUND
wheat stem rust caused by the fungal pathogen puccinia graminis pers. f. sp. tritici  is a major worldwide threat to wheat crops. the re-appearance of stem rust epidemics in east africa and their spread eastward to yemen and iran, based on ug99- a wheat stem rust isolate virulent on a large proportion of the world’s current wheat varieties, has alarmed the global wheat community  <cit> . more recently, new epidemics of stem rust caused by a different race of pgt have been reported in germany and ethiopia  reiterating the need to identify new resistance genes against rust pathogens, and to understand the mechanism of resistance, which may lead to development of novel strategies for crop protection.

highly effective stem rust resistance was introgressed into hexaploid wheat cv, marquis from the rust-resistant, cultivated emmer wheat cv yaroslav from crosses initiated in  <dig> by american breeder e.s. mcfadden. crosses were made between yaroslav emmer and several varieties of hard red spring wheat, but were only successful with cv marquis. several years of selection for stem rust resistance, quality and yield among progeny derived from a single f <dig> plant resulted in the selections h44– <dig>  h29– <dig> and h35– <dig>  the line h29– <dig> was later released as the variety hope  <cit> . high levels of field resistance against pgt were observed in hope and h44– <dig> . this source of stem rust resistance was then used widely in the us, australian and cimmyt wheat breeding programs. mcintosh et al.  <cit>  and knott  <cit>  genetically characterised the basis of resistance in hope and h <dig>  and identified three race-specific genes; sr7b from the marquis parent, and sr9d and sr <dig> from yaroslav. in addition hare and mcintosh  <cit>  described an adult plant, partial resistance gene, sr <dig>  effective against all tested pgt strains. using substitution lines carrying each hope chromosome in chinese spring, hare and mcintosh  <cit>  mapped sr <dig> to chromosome arm 3bs. selection in breeding programs for high levels of field resistance to stem rust derived from cv hope combined sr <dig> with various seedling resistance genes, which resulted in effective stem rust resistance present in many wheat cultivars  <cit> . the partial resistance of sr <dig> has remained effective for almost a century in all wheat growing areas of the world, and is also effective against ug <dig> and its derivatives. however, to be economically effective, sr <dig> must be combined with seedling resistance genes  <cit> . consequently, the sr <dig> gene will continue to form an important component of resistance gene combinations required to control stem rust epidemics.

the resistance conferred by sr <dig> is characterized by a non-hypersensitive, partial resistance response, with varying effectiveness under field conditions. sr <dig> is one of the few race non-specific, adult plant, resistance  genes currently used to provide protection against stem rust in wheat. sr <dig> stem rust resistance displays a dosage dependent resistance phenotype , and is linked to pseudo-black chaff , a phenotypic trait that causes varying degrees of dark pigmentation on the stem internodes and glumes  <cit> . in certain backgrounds, sr <dig> is also associated with race specific seedling resistance to leaf rust caused by p. triticina, due to the action of two complementary resistance genes, lr <dig>  which is linked to sr <dig>  <cit>  and the lr <dig> gene on chromosome 4b  <cit> . the basis of this complementary effect is unknown. we have demonstrated that a gene for resistance to wheat powdery mildew, blumeria graminis f. sp. triticae , also maps to the sr <dig> locus, but whether this resistance is race specific is unknown at this stage.

as a first step towards positional cloning of the gene, we previously mapped sr <dig> on the short arm of chromosome 3b, constructed a high resolution map of the region  <cit> , and were unable to break the linkage between sr <dig>  lr <dig>  powdery mildew resistance and the phenotypic marker, pbc  <cit> . in the present paper, we produce a physical map of the sr <dig> region from hope 3b, determine its dna sequence and compare the haplotypes and gene content of the sr <dig> locus in hope and chinese spring wheats. this analysis has revealed a major presence-absence polymorphism in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat for a cluster of ten germin-like protein genes.

methods
plant populations and phenotyping
the generation of the high resolution mapping family between chinese spring and the chromosome 3b substitution line chinese spring  and the stem and leaf rust rust phenotyping has been described previously  <cit> . seeds of emmer  accessions including cv yaroslav and of triticum aestivum cv marquis and cv hope were obtained from the australian winter cereal collection, tamworth. the chinese spring 3bs deletion stock  was obtained from wheat genetic and genomic resource center, kansas state university, usa. the cap lines were part of the us wheat coordinated agricultural project  and kindly provided by gina brown-guedira usda.

construction of the 3b-specific bac library from cv. hope
the bac library from chromosome 3b of cv. hope consisted of two sub-libraries designated taahop3bfha and taahop3bfhb, respectively. both sub-libraries were prepared from the dna of chromosome 3b purified by flow-cytometric sorting  <cit>  . purified genomic dna was partially digested with hindiii and cloned into the pindigobac- <dig> vector . the taahop3bfha sub library was constructed from a limited number of chromosomes  as described in Šafář et al.  <cit> , with some modifications. the smaller amount of dna was compensated by lower than normal stringency size selection, including just one size-selection step and usage of dna fractions of a relatively smaller size . this resulted in a bac library consisting of  <dig>  clones, with an average insert size of 78 kb. this sub-library represented ~6-fold coverage of chromosome 3b. the taahop3bfhb sub library was constructed from  <dig> ×  <dig> chromosomes  by applying two size-selection steps as described in Šimková et al.  <cit> . the higher amount of dna allowed efficient cloning of larger dna fragments , resulting in a library of  <dig>  bac clones with mean insert size of 160 kb, which also represented ~6-fold coverage of chromosome 3b. screening of the library was done using 32p labeled dna probe using standard protocols.

construction of a non-gridded bac library from cv. hope
a second bac library designated tae-b-hope-ng was constructed from cv hope genomic dna without chromosome sorting, at the centre national de resources génomiques végétales - inra, france. it was produced using a non-gridded bac library construction protocol based on isidore et al.  <cit>  with the following modifications:  growth of pooled bac clones in liquid lb medium;  bac pools dna amplification by whole genome genomiphi.v <dig> phi <dig> enzyme kit  instead of dna extraction;  use of secondary pooling steps in order to identify positive clone coordinates with less screening effort after clone picking. high molecular weight  dna was prepared from 20 g of leaf material from cv. hope. embedded hmw dna was partially digested with hindiii , size selected, eluted and ligated into pindigobac- <dig> hindiii-cloning ready vector . two successive hmw dna extractions and three independent sizing steps led to production of  <dig>  bac clones  representing a total ~2-fold coverage of genome. bac clones were divided into  <dig> pools before overnight growth and dna amplification. pools were screened using specific pcr markers previously developed from clones in the 3b sorted library. the primer sequences for the probe pcr fragments and pcr markers are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

bac sequencing and sequence assembly
bac clones from the sr <dig> locus of hope were isolated using probes from the previously characterised 3b locus of chinese spring and were sequenced by a bac-by-bac shotgun method at 10× coverage using applied biosystems capillary sequencing. base calling, quality trimming and assembly of the raw sequence reads into contigs were done using the phred/phrap/consed package  <cit>  and gap <dig>  <cit>  from the staden package was used for data integration and sequence finishing. the bacs isolated from the non-enriched hope genomic dna library were sequenced using roche  <dig> sequencing platform. a hybrid assembly of the sequence from  <dig> and sanger sequencing was done using newbler v.  <dig> . additional gap closure was performed on the assembled scaffold sequences by sequencing pooled bac dna and an 8 kb paired end library using roche  <dig> sequencing platform. scaffolds were also assembled using sequencher v.  <dig> . annotated sequence of sr <dig> region in hope has been deposited in genbank .

gene annotation: gene prediction
genes were annotated using the gene prediction software packages fgenesh , augustus  and genscan . gene calls were also made using clc genomics workbench v,  <dig> . the predicted gene sequences were used for blastx and blastp analysis against protein databases  to identify candidate genes and determine whether they were full length. intron-exon structure of predicted genes was refined by blast comparisons of the predicted gene sequences with the expressed sequence tag  database at ncbi .

gene annotation: rna-seq
further expressed sequences in the sr <dig> region were identified by aligning rna-seq reads from leaves of cv hope with the sr <dig> genomic sequence. because of the association of mildew and rust resistance at the sr <dig> locus, this rna was isolated from plants that were inoculated with mildew at four weeks after sowing by applying spores of a glasshouse isolate of bgt to the abaxial surface of the leaves with a dry paint brush, followed by application of a fine spray of water. plants were maintained under a shade curtain in the glasshouse at 23°c, in tubs of shallow water to increase humidity, and leaves were sampled at 15 hours after inoculation, and at five days after inoculation. total rna was isolated using a qiagen rna-easy plant mini-kit, and rna was dnase-treated on the column using the qiagen protocol. a pooled sample containing 50% each of dnase-treated rna isolated from leaves collected at 15 hours and five days after inoculation was sequenced by the australian genome research facility. rna-seq was quality trimmed and aligned to the hope sr <dig> genomic sequence using clc-genomics workbench. expressed regions of the genomic sequence, for which rna-seq reads aligned at 100% identity, were annotated by blastn comparison with dna sequence databases.

mapping
gene sequences identified in the sr <dig> region of hope and cs were mapped as pcr markers  using the high resolution mapping family described previously  <cit> . the specificity of pcr markers to chromosome 3b was confirmed using the dna of the chinese spring 3bs- <dig> deletion line. pcrs were performed in a volume of 20 μl with 10 mm of each primer,  <dig>  mm dntps,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  units gotaq dna polymerase  and 100–200 ng of template dna. the annealing temperature used for pcr was generally 3-4°c below the tm of the primers used.

RESULTS
a bac contig for the sr <dig> region in the stem rust resistant cv hope
although the sequence information from the non-sr <dig> carrying wheat chinese spring  wheat was useful initially  <cit> , the characterisation of the locus required bac clones from the sr <dig> carrying region of hope wheat. a bac library was prepared from flow sorted chromosome 3b of hope and screened with low copy markers derived from the ends of cs bac clones. a total of  <dig> bacs were identified that formed six contigs . efforts to isolate additional bac clones from this library, and to close the gaps between the contigs were unsuccessful. to complete the physical map, an additional whole genome bac library was developed from hope, and screened with markers flanking the gaps. the positions of the seven newly selected bac clones were confirmed on the basis of sequence identity with overlapping regions from the bacs derived from the 3b chromosome-sorted library and also genetic mapping of markers which were derived from these new clones. in total, the  <dig> bac clones formed a single contig of 968 kb, and included the distal and proximal markers rko_ <dig> and dox_ <dig> that recombined with sr <dig>  the same interval in cs was 567 kb long  <cit>  indicating that the two haplotypes were substantially divergent and included deletion/insertion events. the dna sequence of the 968 kb sr <dig> region  was determined by sequencing all  <dig> bac clones.figure  <dig>

based on the level of sequence identity between cs and hope, the sr <dig> locus was divided into two sections . the proximal section  of the hope sr <dig> locus sequence showed high similarity with the corresponding region from cs. eight genes were annotated in section  <dig> of both hope and cs, with  <dig> additional genes present in cs   <cit> . the length and gene content of this sub-region were closely comparable between cs and hope, except for a segment of approximately 40 kb in cs, containing a flowering locus t– like gene and emb_ <dig>  which were missing in hope . most of the shared genes in section  <dig> contained several dna sequence polymorphisms between the cs and hope, and their predicted protein products differed by one or more amino acid polymorphisms.figure  <dig>

region with the corresponding region on cs . section  <dig> denotes region between 45–360 kb, section two includes 360-915 kb region.



in section two , distal to the shared wd-domain pseudogene, the hope and cs regions differed markedly. in this region,  <dig> putative genes were annotated in hope, whereas only seven genes or gene fragments were annotated in cs. . small regions of high similarity between hope and cs were evident at 560-590 kb and at 900-968 kb  but apart from these islands of similarity, the two dna sequences diverged radically. most notably, an insertion of approximately 100 kb containing ten genes annotated as germin-like proteins  was present in hope, positioned between cs gene ids ctg0011b. <dig>  and  <dig>  . despite the lack of overall sequence similarity across the distal part of the locus, other genes that were annotated between wd-domain and dox_ <dig> were present in both haplotypes . this section of the sr <dig> locus contained several genes of unknown function  that were identified by alignment of the genomic sequence with rna seq data. these expressed sequences were not annotated as putative genes in the published cs sequence , and are listed with the accession number of the most similar genbank est in table  <dig>  for ca <dig>  cn <dig>  ca <dig>  hp <dig>  cn <dig> and bm <dig>  the sequences in hope were predicted to encode small proteins , but in cs the putative genes were truncated. overall, the dna regions that encode these predicted proteins showed  <dig> to 92% dna sequence identity between the sr <dig> haplotypes. cd <dig> encoded a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids in hope and  <dig> amino acids in cs. re-sequencing of the gene from cs revealed an error in the deposited fn <dig> cs sequence, in which insertion of an extra nucleotide disrupted the open reading frame, resulting in the gene not being annotated in the original cs genomic sequence  <cit> . the protein coding regions of the cd <dig> genes from hope and cs shared 92% dna identity, predicting proteins with 90% amino acid identity.

hypothetical genes d8lal <dig> and d8lal <dig> were positioned 4 kb from each other in the cs genomic sequence. in contrast, the relative position of these genes was reversed and 60 kb apart in hope, indicating that inversion and insertion events occurred at this position between the two haplotypes. predicted genes encoding a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan precursor , two beta-expansin 1a precursor proteins , and a putative disulfide oxidoreductase  formed the distal end of the sr <dig> locus in both hope and cs. all these genes were also present in the corresponding hope region, as well as an additional copy of the truncated tetratricopeptide repeat domain containing protein, tpr_ <dig> and a beta-expansin precursor, annotated as bex_ <dig> .

mapping sr <dig> with respect to newly derived dna markers
to establish the region that co-segregated with sr <dig>  pcr markers developed from polymorphic regions of the hope and cs sequences were mapped in the high resolution mapping family developed by kota et al.  <cit> . at the proximal end of the sr <dig> region, the marker from the msf_ <dig> gene  was separated from sr <dig> in two recombinants, while the marker from the rko_ <dig> gene  was separated by one recombinant. at the distal end, marker rga_ <dig>  derived from a nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat gene , was separated from sr <dig> in two recombinants, while dox_ <dig>  was separated in a single recombinant. markers developed from genes between rko_ <dig> and dox_ <dig> co-segregated with sr <dig>  the genes shared between hope and cs all encoded proteins with one or more polymorphisms between the two haplotypes, and several genes, including the glps were specific to hope. thus, sequence comparisons alone were unable to pinpoint a specific candidate for sr <dig> 

sr2-linked glps
the glp genes co-segregating with sr <dig> were of particular interest because of the reported association of glps with plant defence . following the convention used for naming glps on chromosome  <dig> of rice  <cit> , the ten glps from the sr <dig> locus were named taglp3_ <dig> to taglp3_ <dig> . taglp3_ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were pseudogenes because they encoded truncated proteins compared to the other glps. of the remaining seven apparently full-length genes, six,  were organised as divergently-transcribed pairs, each separated by 610–675 bps between predicted atg translation start codons, presumably constituting a short, shared promoter . only taglp3_ <dig> was present as a single gene. sequence comparison showed that the sr <dig> locus taglp3s could be organised into  <dig> sequence groups . one group consisted of glps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , while glps  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  formed the second category. the sequence identity between members within a group ranged between 93-98% while the identity between the glps in different groups was 77-82%. for divergently transcribed genes, the gene pair consists of one member of each group. comparisons of the derived amino acid sequences of the wheat taglp3s with sequences from wheat, barley and rice showed that the taglp3s were most closely related to a previously undescribed, single, divergently transcribed pair of barley glps at a putatively orthologous locus on chromosome 3h . less similar sequences were also present in other cereals, including rice and brachypodium, although not necessarily at syntenic genomic locations. the taglp3s and the orthologous barley glp gene pair products shared more than 90% amino acid identity with each other, and shared  <dig> to 84% identity with the next most similar sequences in barley, the ger <dig> sub-family, and with the most similar sequences in rice, a group of ger <dig> sub-family osglp8s on chromosome  <dig> .figure  <dig>

amplification of taglp3s from hexaploid and tetraploid wheat
to further investigate the taglp <dig> presence/absence polymorphism in other wheat genotypes, we designed pcr primers based on hope coding and non-coding sequences for all the taglp3s  to determine if the large insertion carrying these glps was present in other wheats. all glps amplified from genomic dna of the wheat cultivar marquis , which was the original recipient of sr <dig> from emmer, while none could be amplified from cs indicating that this polymorphism existed in hexaploid wheat before introgression of sr <dig>  three snps and two nucleotide insertions were identified in the shared promoter of taglp3_ 1/ <dig> between hope and marquis . sequencing of the promoter region and predicted coding sequences of taglp3_ <dig> and 3– <dig> from diverse germplasm including cap <dig>  cap <dig>  cap <dig>  cap <dig>  cap <dig>  cap <dig> and cap <dig> revealed only the hope or marquis haplotypes . one of these polymorphisms resulted in loss of a hincii restriction site in the marquis sequence and was used to develop a caps marker . a second snp occurred 3’ of taglp <dig> - <dig> and was previously developed as a diagnostic pcr marker for sr <dig>  cssr <dig>  <cit> . pcr was used to assess the presence of the taglp3s in a range of hexaploid and tetraploid wheat genotypes . based on the pcr screening, four haplotypes were identified:  <dig>  both pcr products did not amplify ,  <dig>  both pcr products carried the marquis alleles ,  <dig>  both pcr products carried the hope alleles ,  <dig>  taglp3_1/ <dig> caps generated the hope allele, while cssr <dig> amplified the marquis allele . the tetraploid durums and nine out of the  <dig> emmers were null for both markers. yaroslav and aus  <dig> emmer contained the hope allele for both markers , while a second emmer  carried the hope allele at taglp3_ 1/ <dig> and the marquis allele for cssr <dig> . in hexaploid wheat, all four haplotypes were present . the cssr <dig> marker was diagnostic for the presence of sr <dig> in a wide range of wheat genotypes  <cit> , however the taglp3_1/ <dig> caps marker detected the hope allele in several wheats that lacked sr <dig> confirming that cssr <dig> is the more useful marker . most significantly, no differences were detected between hope and marquis in the coding regions of the glp genes.table  <dig>

discussion
sr <dig> is not related to nb-lrr resistance genes or apr genes lr <dig> and yr36
in this study we have determined the sequence of a region of the wheat chromosome carrying the sr <dig> adult plant stem rust resistance gene from cv hope, and compared dna sequence and gene content with the non-sr <dig> cultivar chinese spring that was used as the rust susceptible parent in a high resolution mapping of sr <dig>  <cit> . there were no nucleotide binding site leucine rich-repeat  genes, the most frequent class of resistance gene, that co-segregated with sr <dig>  which indicates that sr <dig> is not a member of this class. further, no sequences related to other cloned apr genes such as lr <dig> or yr <dig> occured in the region  <cit> . there were many polymorphisms, including large indels between the two haplotypes, preventing identification of sr <dig> from sequence data alone.

haplotype divergence and gene cloning
the sr <dig> region of hope and cs diverged in gene content, including the presence in hope, and absence in cs, of a cluster of ten glp genes. large insertion-deletion events have been reported at other loci in wheat and in other cereals. for example, physical mapping of the adult plant stripe rust resistance locus yr <dig>  <cit>  showed a 183 kb insertion in the resistant line rsl <dig> compared to the susceptible durum wheat langdon. this region, carrying four genes including the yr <dig> resistance gene, originated from the wild species t. turgidum var. dicoccoides. similarly, a deletion of 351 kb was reported in t. turgidum var. dicoccoides compared to langdon in the region containing tsn <dig>  a gene that confers sensitivity to the toxin toxa in tan spot disease of wheat  <cit>  in rice, large sequence variation between a wild donor species and a recurrent parent was reported for the yield-improving qtl, q-gy <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we report major haplotype divergence within the hexaploid wheat species, indicating that large insertion/deletion events may be common, and not restricted to comparisons between inter-species haplotypes. such major differences will impede rapid, map-based identification of target genes in specific wheat genotypes, even when high quality, reference genome sequence of cs becomes available. it is also likely that haplotype divergence, especially the large insertion/deletion of glps in the sr <dig> region, resulted in the suppression of recombination and lack of genetic resolution of the target region. consequently, a new mapping family was established by using marquis, which carries the glp gene cluster, as the susceptible parent. initial results have indicated that in this family, recombination occurred within the region that previously co-segregated with sr <dig>  the characterisation of new recombinants is in progress.

what is the possible evolutionary value of the presence /absence glp polymorphism on 3b?
it has been suggested that glp functional diversity has arisen via sequential gene duplication events, followed by mutation, including in flanking regulatory regions, giving rise to diversity in temporal and spatial gene expression patterns  <cit> . diverse wheats reflect four glp haplotypes in the sr <dig> region; sr <dig> types with the hope allele at taglp3_ <dig> and taglp3_1/ <dig>  marquis types with the marquis allele at taglp3_ <dig> and either the marquis or hope allele at taglp3_1/ <dig>  and cs types with no glps at the locus   <cit> . the hope haplotype with sr <dig> and stem rust resistance has been selected by breeders. it is possible that there is an as yet undefined selection acting for or against the marquis  and cs  haplotypes in different geographic regions, which may account for the wide spread occurrence of the chromosome 3b presence/absence polymorphism in sr2- wheat genotypes. this is reminiscent of the presence/absence polymorphism for the resistance gene rpm <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana field populations that has been interpreted to result from balancing selection  <cit> .

germin-like proteins
the glp genes at the sr <dig> locus are of interest because of the reported association of this category of genes with plant defence responses. glps are small , secreted, functionally and taxonomically diverse cupin domain-containing proteins, two of which are reported to produce hydrogen peroxide, a plant defence signal, while several other members of the protein family have been associated with other enzymatic functions  <cit> . sequence analysis showed that taglp3s at the sr <dig> locus were most similar to a pair of divergently-transcribed glps at a syntenic position on barley chromosome 3h . the taglp3s and this orthologous barley locus, which is distinct from gerd previously mapped on barley chromosome 3h  <cit> , constitute a novel sub-family of glps which has not been studied previously, and as far as we are aware, the only sub-family transcribed divergently from short intergenic promoters. the next closest glp sub-family relative of the sr <dig> locus sub-family is the ger <dig> class of glp proteins in wheat, barley and rice, members of which have all been functionally associated with fungal disease resistance  . transient over-expression of hvger <dig> or hvger <dig>  as well as transient silencing by rna interference of hvger <dig> or hvger <dig>  <cit>  protected barley epidermal cells from attack by powdery mildew. transient expression of wheat orthologs of hvger <dig>  germin-gf- <dig> , taglp2a and taglp2b  in epidermal cells also reduced the penetration efficiency of the powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei in wheat  <cit> . no experiments involving over-expression of glps in stable transgenic wheat or barley that confirm a direct role of these genes in disease resistance have been reported. manosalva et al.  <cit>  identified a qtl for rice blast resistance containing a cluster of  <dig> glps on rice chromosome  <dig>  consisting of both ger <dig> and ger <dig> sub-family glps. rna interference studies in transgenic rice showed that as more osglp genes were suppressed, disease susceptibility of the plants increased. of the  <dig> osglps, the osglp8- <dig> member  was most effective in providing resistance. the resistance conferred by this qtl was effective against the rice blast and sheath blight pathogens. despite the sequence similarity between the taglp <dig> gene cluster at the sr <dig> locus and glps from other cereals that are associated with disease resistance, our data show that the predicted amino acid sequences of the taglp3s are identical between the stem rust sensitive cv marquis, and the resistant cv hope. future analysis will determine whether the sequence polymorphisms adjacent to taglp3_ <dig>  or  <dig> are associated with any differences in gene expression between hope and marquis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we completed the physical map of the sr <dig> locus in stem rust resistant cv hope. sequence comparison with susceptible cs revealed major haplotype divergence including deletion/insertion events carrying a large cluster of glps in hope. the glps were however present in marquis, a stem rust susceptible wheat not carrying sr <dig>  haplotype divergence within hexaploid wheat may prevent rapid map-based identification of target genes in specific wheat genotypes even when high quality, reference genome sequence is available. candidate genes within the sr <dig> region are being evaluated for their capacity to confer stem rust resistance.
