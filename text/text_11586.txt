BACKGROUND
an oncogene is a modified gene that promotes unregulated proliferation of cells, increasing the chance that a normal cell develops into a tumor cell, possibly resulting in cancer  <cit> . the normal copy of such a gene is called a proto-oncogene. the first oncogene, src, was discovered in a chicken retrovirus in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, numerous oncogenes have been identified and classified into different groups based on their cellular functions. as of now, oncogenes have been identified at all levels of signal transduction cascades that control cell growth, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> .

protein domains are compact and semi-independent units of a protein, each of which may consist of one or more contiguous segments of a peptide chain and have its own biological function  <cit> . they are generally viewed as the basic unit of protein function and evolution. various sequence- and structure-based methods have been developed for the identification of protein domains  <cit> , and several domain databases, such as dali  <cit> , pfam  <cit> , smart  <cit>  and prodom  <cit> , have been established.

recent studies on oncogenes and cancer pathology have pointed to the importance of individual domains and domain fusions in oncogenesis. it has been reported that genes containing domains from specific domain families may have particular relevance to human cancer  <cit> . for example, the tyrosine kinase domain is known to play significant roles in the development of numerous diseases such as cancer  <cit> . another example is the atm-related domain that is required for histone acetyltransferase recruitment and myc-dependent oncogenesis  <cit> . additionally, cml, a form of leukaemia, is associated with the fusion of bcr and abl genes or their constituent domains  <cit> . therefore, understanding the constituent domains of oncogenes as well as their origins may shed new light about the initiation and development of cancers.

in this study, we have developed an integrated computational pipeline for studying the domain composition, domain fusion and domain origin. specifically, our computational pipeline includes the following key components:  identification of the origin of each component domain of known oncogenes and the relevant fusion events;  co-occurrence analysis of oncogene domains;  identification of the domains and domain pairs that appear more frequently in oncogenes than in the background, namely the collection of all human genes; and  functional analyses of the identified frequent domains and domain pairs. we then applied this pipeline to all well characterized human oncogenes, and had a number of new and interesting observations. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis specifically addressing the domain composition, origin and fusion of oncogenes.

RESULTS
using the computational procedures outlined in material and methods, we have carried out a detailed analysis of oncogene domains and co-occurring domains for their origins and functional analysis.

a. origin of oncogene domains
origin of distinct domains in cellular organisms
 <dig> distinct domains  have been identified from  <dig> oncogenes, based on pfam domain assignments. we have considered the subtype scenarios for specific domains, i.e., the different alignments for a specific domain in one clan and using one domain id to denote the corresponding subtypes. in our dataset, there exist two alignments sh3_ <dig> and sh3_ <dig> for the sh <dig> domain. the same holds for the sam domain, where sam_pnt is the entry for the sam domain and two different alignments, sam_ <dig> and sam_ <dig>  exist for this entry, respectively. although they have different accession numbers in pfam, we just use sh <dig> and sam_pnt to denote these two types of domains, respectively. the distribution of these domains' origins across different cellular organisms is given in figure  <dig>  about 50%  of oncogene domains have their origins in the early stages of organismal evolution prior to the emergence of the metazoans, and no domains are found to arise from mammals. it should be noted that these results have been further refined by our literature survey from the original subtractive searching results , to take potential hgt into consideration. based on the literature search, we found that domain swib and non-enzymatic domains ig and sam are likely to have arisen in eukaryote. their homologs are identified in prokaryotes, likely resulted from hgts from eukaryotes  <cit> . also the origin of tyrosine kinases  is probably in eukaryote and their presence in bacteria may also be explained most parsimoniously by hgt events  <cit> .

in order to further analyze the statistical difference between the domain origin distribution of oncogenes versus that of the other genes, we have compared our results with lipika et al.  <cit> , which presented an analysis on the origins of the conserved domains in the whole human proteome. table  <dig> presents a thorough calculation of the enrichment ratios of oncogene domains that originated from  <dig> categories  compared with the whole domain dataset in the human genes and their p-values. our results indicate that the origin distribution of oncogene domains is largely consistent with that reported by lipika et al.  <cit>  for the whole human proteome, except for those of bacterial or metozoan origins.

domain functions
we divided the oncogene domains into groups based on their go annotation . these oncogene domains show diverse functions, including regulation of transcription and apoptosis, protein kinase activity and dna/rna/protein binding activity.

further analyses suggest that domains with different functions might have come from different origins . for example, domains related to immunoglobulin and tyrosine kinase  are found in archaea, bacteria or in both. these domains are known to be closely related to oncogenesis  <cit>  . other domains such as rhodopsin domains , cyclin dependent kinases  domains  and the intracellular signalling domains  seem to have originated in eukaryotes. several domains related to the development of the nervous system such as wnt, ephrin_lbd and sema seem to have originated in metazoans. in addition, function domains required by vertebrates such as hormones involved in mitogenic and inflammatory activity  seem to have originated in chordates.

domains originated from viruses
among the  <dig> identified oncogene domains,  <dig> are found to be present in viruses . the three most frequently occurring domains in virus proteins are helicase_c, ank and dead. ank has been reported in diverse groups of proteins such as enzymes, toxins and transcription factors. the existence of ank in both prokaryotes and viruses may have resulted from horizontal gene transfers  <cit> . the helicase domain family  is reportedly related to hepatitis virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and involved in cell growth control  <cit> . in addition, some other families such as zinc finger domains , immunoglobulin-related domains  and protein-tyrosine kinase related domains  also have remote homologs in viruses and all these three domain families are closely related to oncogenesis. overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> virus-originated domains are known to be related to oncogenesis.

b. oncogene domain fusion
domain fusion in cellular organisms
we have identified  <dig> whole domain fusion events in the  <dig> oncogenes. among them,  <dig> contain two distinct domains  and the others contain at least three different domains. their initial appearance in cellular organisms and their presence/absence in viruses are given .

fused domains in viruses
among the  <dig> fused domains,  <dig> events have been identified in viruses. these  <dig> fused domains can be divided into  <dig> categories according to their functions: pkinase-related domain fusion ; platelet-derived growth factor domain fusion ; helicases-related domain fusion  and dna/ligand-binding domain fusion . interestingly, ~90% of the virus proteins harbouring these fused domains come from the potyviridae family and the remaining almost all come from the orthoretrovirinae family. potyviridae is one of the largest and most important families of plant viruses. although the relationship between retroviruses and cancer has been widely established  <cit> , the possible link between potyviridae and oncogenesis is unknown.

c. proteome-wide patterns of origins of oncogenes
we have also examined the origins of all the oncogenes as a whole. our goal is to find out at what stage in evolution all component domains of an oncogene are fused together for the first time, considered as the origin of the oncogene .

among the  <dig> oncogenes whose initial domain fusions occurred in prokaryotes,  <dig> have the same domain fusions in viruses . it seems that domains with prokaryotic origins tend to present in viruses.



we have divided the oncogenes into six categories according to their functions: signal transducers, no-receptor kinases, growth factors, growth factor receptors, transcription factors and others. based on our examination of the oncogene origins, we have observed some general relationships between the origins and the functional categories of the oncogenes .

signal transducers
in our dataset, most of the oncogenes acting as signal transducers originated from prokaryotes. we have observed that a large number of such genes contain the ras and pkinase domains, and are involved in signal transduction, protein binding and kinase activities. it is believed that most ras proteins exist in an inactive state in the resting cell where they bind gdp  <cit> , and their oncogenesis is closely related to their interactions with other receptors.

no-receptor kinases
non-receptor kinases oncogenes are mostly tyrosine kinases discovered through retroviral transduction and/or through dna transfection that do not have a receptor-like transmembrane domain. these proteins are partly associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and more related to cell differentiation than to proliferation. another group of serine/threonine kinases such as raf <dig> also belongs to this category. our analysis shows that all the oncogenes of this group originated from metazoans.

growth factors
only one oncogene pdgfb  is known to be a growth factor. this gene encodes one of the two polypeptide chains that together constitute pdgf, a platelet-derived growth factor domain. our analysis shows that the pdgf domain generally originated in metazoans or chordates, and the corresponding oncogene first came into being in chordates.

growth factor receptors
the erbb oncogene family was originally isolated from chicken erthroleukemia, encoding an epidermal growth factor  receptor  <cit> . several other oncogenes also encode proteins with a receptor-like domain, including kit and ros  <cit> . these oncogenes consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain. our analysis results show that these genes generally originated in metazoans or chordates, representing important regulatory proteins involved in phosphorylation  <cit> .

transcription factors
transcription factors are nuclear proteins that regulate the expression of their target genes. they typically belong to multi-gene families that share common dna-binding domains such as zinc fingers. our data shows that oncogenes acting as transcription factors mostly originated in chordates, and a few of them  came from metazoans. it has been speculated that the pathologically activated form of these transcription factors no longer fulfils their physiological regulating functions but acts as a carcinogen  <cit> .

many oncogenes of this category have been identified in our dataset. one representative is jun, which can bind tightly to other nuclear onco-proteins. in addition, a substantial portion of oncogenes in this category belongs to the myc gene family that is related to nuclear transcription and myeloblastosis. it has been reported that the myc genes have been found in a wide variety of vertebrates, including mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish  <cit> . the myeloblastosis function in these oncogenes may have evolved in response to some specific needs by chordates.

programmed cell death regulators
the first oncogene shown to regulate programmed cell death is bcl <dig>  <cit> . several other oncogenes related to apoptosis have also been identified in our dataset. we found that these oncogenes often originated in metazoans. the mechanisms of apoptosis have not been fully elucidated, but previous studies indicate that the process of apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of cell signals which may originate either extracellularly  or intracellularly   <cit> . this type of complex cell signal network may be more active and required by metazoans.

d. frequent domains and domain pairs in oncogenes
oncogene domain co-occurrence graph
we have constructed a domain co-occurrence graph for  <dig> oncogenes, which consists of  <dig> domains  and  <dig> co-occurring domain pairs , as shown in figure  <dig>  the graph has  <dig> connected components, each containing at least  <dig> nodes, with the largest component having  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges. the graph has a sparse but highly clustered structure. the few highly connected nodes representing domains like pkinase_tyr, sh <dig>  sh <dig> form hubs of the  network.

a large-scale analysis of co-occurrence networks of the protein domains collected from the prodom, pfam and prosite domain databases was previously performed by s. wuchty  <cit> , which found that these networks exhibited small-world and scale-free properties. in our study, the same properties were observed for oncogene domain network . we conclude that the oncogene domain network has a sparse but highly clustered structure. highly connected nodes emerge in the network which predominantly shapes the topology of the underlying network and a few domains are connected to many different domains forming a few hubs.

frequent domains and domain pairs
we have identified a number of domains and domain pairs that are highly frequent in oncogenes, compared with those in the background human genome. we consider such domains as significant if they show high occurring frequencies and high numbers of co-occurring domains in the oncogenes but not in the background set. these domains are pkinase_tyr, sh <dig>  sh <dig>  rhogef and fn <dig>  with functions related to signal transduction, enzymatic activity, and cell surface binding. moreover, pkinase_tyr has protein-tyrosine kinase activities, and sh <dig> and sh <dig> mediate protein interactions. they are known to play a key role in diverse biological processes such as growth, differentiation, metabolism and apoptosis in response to external and internal stimuli.

to find out which domain pairs occur more frequently in oncogenes than in the background genome, we have carried out enrichment analyses of the domain pairs. table  <dig> gives the domain pairs with p-values more significant than 10- <dig>  it should be noted that 10- <dig> is a rather significant cut-off based on our experience in identifying frequent domain pairs from the background.



we expect that domain fusions might have brought new functions to their host proteins. this type of functional transformation has been reported previously  <cit> . for instance, the sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains frequently appear together in various signalling proteins involved in recognition of phosphorylated tyrosine  <cit> , where sh <dig> localizes tyrosine-phosphorylated sites and sh <dig> binds to target proteins  <cit> . another example is that the bhlh motif and the "myc boxes" co-exist in the myc gene family. bhlh uses a common mechanism for dna binding and dimerization while the myc boxes, on the another hand, appear to be unique to the myc family and are involved in transcription activation and neoplastic transformation  <cit> . while the individual functions of these two domains are generally understood, their synergistic effects in their bounded protein complex are not known  <cit> .

two significant triad domain fusions, {sh <dig>  sh <dig>  pkinase_tyr} and {furin-like, recep_l_domain, pkinase_tyr}, are found  and they form six fused domain pairs . pkinase_tyr are known to be related to protein tyrosine kinase activities and amino acid phosphorylation. the other two domains, furin-like and recep_l_domain, are involved in signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> . it is also noteworthy that domains corresponding to the tyrosine kinase family are among the most frequent families in oncogenes. these domains may carry essential functions as standalone domains and may also extend their functionality to accomplish complex tasks in combination with other domains.

e. phylogenetic profiling diversities of frequent domains and domain pairs
diverse origins of frequent domains and domain pairs are found in cellular organisms through our phylogenetic profile analyses, which provide complementary information to our earlier analysis of domains and domain pairs. phylogenetic profiling is a computational technique for functional analyses of domains and their fusions  <cit> . we have calculated the phylogenetic profiles of all oncogene domains and domain pairs to find their taxonomic distribution across  <dig> cellular genomes, grouped into  <dig> taxa: archaea, bacteria, protozoa, viridiplantae, fungi, metazoan-invertebrates, and metazoan-chordates. the phylogenetic profiles of frequent domains and domain pairs are listed in table  <dig> 



our data show that nearly all frequent individual domains originated in prokaryotes, and have a wide distribution across many genomes, while the frequent domain pairs almost all first emerged in metazoans . therefore, while individual domains may have early origins, most frequent domain pairs first came together in higher organisms. although multi-domain proteins are more common in higher organisms, it is not clear if this observation about frequent oncogene domain pairs is generally true for any domain pairs from any groups of genes, which will be left for future study.

CONCLUSIONS
we have analyzed the origins of component domains and domain fusions of oncogenes, and studied the unique characteristics of the oncogene domain pairs in comparison with those in the background human genome. most of these domains and domain pairs are functionally related to protein tyrosine kinase activities, which are closely related to cancer pathophysiology. our phylogenetic profile analysis provides additional evidence to support our observation that frequent domain pairs in oncogenes tend to originate in higher organisms. the knowledge gained from this computational study may provide useful insights about the complex processes of oncongenesis.
