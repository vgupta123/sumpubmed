BACKGROUND
the screening of microorganisms isolated from naturally occurring processes is the most common method of obtaining strains useful for industrial applications. this holds true for lactic acid bacteria , which are used worldwide to produce a variety of fermented foods
 <cit> . because lab have been used in food production for centuries without posing any health risks, they are designated as generally regarded as safe  microorganisms
 <cit> .

lab are normally found in nutrient-rich environments and are able to grow in most raw foods. these bacteria are fastidious and require fermentable carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acids, salts, and vitamins for growth
 <cit> . because of their metabolic properties, lab play an important role in the food industry, contributing significantly to flavor, texture, and frequently the nutritional value of foods
 <cit> .

because of the rapid rise and spread of multi-resistant bacterial pathogens, new methods are needed to combat infection. antibiotics are widely used to prevent the spread of pathogenic bacteria; however, many antibiotics are broad-spectrum drugs that kill bacterial species indiscriminately
 <cit> . bacteriocins have a relatively narrow spectrum of killing activity, and some can be considered pathogen-specific designer drugs. given the diversity of bacteriocins produced in nature, it may be a relatively simple task to identify bacteriocins effective against specific human pathogens
 <cit> . in addition, bacteriocin use may reduce the need for chemical additives in food and minimize the intensity of food processing techniques, contributing to the production of more healthful foods
 <cit> .

in recent years, attention has been focused on lab from different sources that produce bacteriocins that are considered safe as food biopreservatives and can be degraded by gastrointestinal proteases
 <cit> . these probiotic compounds have been used in a variety of industrial applications relevant to both human and animal health without producing side effects. there is an ongoing need to identify new strains with useful characteristics. therefore, the main objective of this study was to isolate and characterize lab that produce bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances  from traditionally prepared milk products  and locally fermented cocoa beans. these fermented products do not use starter cultures; fermentation is the result of wild flora present in the surrounding environment. wild lab strains represent a natural reservoir of strains not exposed to any industrial selection and are potential probiotics and bacteriocin producers
 <cit> . in this study we identified and characterized lab strains that produce high blis levels for possible applications in the food industry.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in recent years much attention has focused on bacteriocin-producing lab isolated from various sources, because bacteriocins are considered safe as food biopreservatives and can be degraded by gastrointestinal proteases
 <cit> . however, lab species present in traditional foods of southeast asian countries have not been widely studied
 <cit> . in this study,  <dig> lab strains isolated from traditional fermented milk products and cocoa beans from rural areas of malaysia and iran were found to produce antimicrobial substances. these lab isolates were characterized, and two of the strains  produced substances active against listeria monocytogenes .

phenotypic characterization based on sugar fermentation reveals biochemical properties of the microorganisms
 <cit>  but may not always provide a strong basis for lab identification
 <cit> . although 16s rdna sequence analysis is a powerful technique for identifying microorganisms and determining phylogenetic relationships
 <cit> , further analysis is needed for positive identification
 <cit> . therefore, we used both of these methods to identify the isolates. all  <dig> isolates were able to ferment ribose, galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, n-acetyl-glucosamine, esculin, salicin, cellobiose and gentiobiose. three different lab species  were identified using the api  <dig> chl system and 16s rdna analysis. identification of kp <dig> as p. acidilactici was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis .

in addition, β-galactosidase activity, tolerance to bile salts and acid conditions, and antimicrobial activity were to evaluate the probiotic properties of kp <dig> . the isolate was able to grow in the presence of 2% nacl, but growth was inhibited by 3% nacl. homofermentative lab are more resistant than heterofermentative lab to nacl
 <cit> . pediococci strains are homofermentative, and tolerance to ph, temperature, and nacl is species- and strain-dependent
 <cit> . bacterial cells cultured in high salt concentrations experience a loss of turgor pressure, which affects cell physiology, enzyme and water activities, and metabolism
 <cit> ; however, some bacteria overcome this effect by regulating osmotic pressure on both sides of the cell membrane
 <cit> . optimum temperature can also be used to differentiate among lab strains
 <cit> . our results indicated that kp <dig>  is a mesophile, which is in agreement with the findings of ronald
 <cit> .

lab are found in many natural environments; however, antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is a growing concern
 <cit> . thus, sensitivity to antibiotics must be determined before lab strains can be used in food production
 <cit> . antibiotic-resistant strains can be detrimental to the health of humans and animals
 <cit> , because they are capable of transferring antibiotic resistance genes to pathogenic bacteria
 <cit> , which can contaminate raw food products such as meat or milk.

data on the antibiotic susceptibility of pediococcus spp. isolated from food are limited. penicillin g, imipenem, gentamicin, netilmicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampin, chloramphenicol, daptomycin, and ramoplanin are generally active against pediococcus species
 <cit> . however, susceptibility is thought to be species-dependent. we found that isolate kp <dig>  was susceptible to ß-lactam antibiotics , as well as erythromycin, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, and tetracycline. in contrast, previous studies have reported that lab are often resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as β-lactams, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolone, imidazole, nitrofurantoin, and fluoroquinolones
 <cit> . ß-lactams, which are bactericidal, are the most widely used class of antimicrobial agent because of their broad spectrum of action and excellent safety profile. ß-lactams inhibit bacteria cell wall synthesis and have a lethal effect on gram-positive bacteria. erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic with a range of action and efficacy similar to that of penicillin. macrolides, which are bacteriostatic, bind to ribosomes to block protein synthesis and are effective against gram-positive microorganisms
 <cit> . the rationale for this contradictory finding with those of halami, et al. <cit>  and herreros et al. <cit>  is not known. lactobacillus and lactococcus were previously reported to be susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics
 <cit> , which is in agreement with the findings of this study. it is possible that the reports of halami et al. and herreros et al. referred to lab in general, whereas the present study specifically analyzed the species p. acidilactici.

the isolate kp <dig>  was susceptible to a gram-negative antibiotic  and aminoglycosides . in contrast, zhou et al. <cit>  and temmerman et al. <cit>  reported that most lactobacillus, enterococcus, and pediococcus strains used as probiotics are resistant to gram-negative and aminoglycoside antibiotics. thus, susceptibility to gram-negative antibiotics may be specific for this lab species.

vancomycin, an inhibitor of cell wall synthesis, is an important antibiotic because it is the last agent broadly effective against multi-drug resistant pathogens
 <cit> . kp <dig>  was not resistant to vancomycin, making it potentially useful for applications in the food industry
 <cit> . kp <dig>  was also susceptible to sulfonamide. resistance to this antibiotic is caused by mutations in the gene encoding dihydropteroate synthase or by acquisition of plasmid-borne genes carrying sulfonamide-resistant forms of the enzyme
 <cit> .

our results also showed that kp <dig>  produced blue/green colonies when grown on m <dig> agar supplemented with x-gal and iptg, demonstrating β-galactosidase activity. β-galactosidase is involved in lactose digestion and is used in the production of lactose-free milk. β-galactosidase–producing bacteria may also be potential probiotics to reduce lactose intolerance
 <cit> .

mean bile concentration in the human gastrointestinal tract is  <dig> % , with a residence time of about  <dig> h
 <cit> . therefore, we tested tolerance to bile salts at a concentration of  <dig> %, which revealed 11% survival after  <dig> h. bile salts interact with bacterial cell membranes, which are composed of lipids and fatty acids, inhibiting growth and killing many bacteria. the protonated  form of bile salt exhibits toxicity by a mechanism similar to that of organic acids. this is involves intracellular acidification and collapse of the proton motive force, which in turn, inhibits the nutrient transport. however, some lab strains are able to hydrolyze bile salts with bile salt hydrolase
 <cit> .

resistance to low ph is one of the major criteria for selecting strains for probiotic applications
 <cit> . survival of kp <dig>  at ph  <dig> exceeded 97%, suggesting its potential for use as a probiotic.

several strains of p. acidilactici isolated from the intestine of healthy dairy cows and characterized using methods similar to those used in the present study were found to inhibit escherichia coli.
 <cit> . the authors reported that p. acidilactici was resistant to acid and bile salts, indicting the ability to survive and colonize in the intestine. in the present study, we found that kp <dig>  was active against the pathogen l. monocytogenes. it is interesting to note that p. acidilactici from two different agricultural sources  showed promising prophylactic properties.

we found that the blis from kp <dig>  was stable in a wide range of ph , suggesting that its antimicrobial activity was not due to the ph of the cell-free supernatant. the reduced activity at high ph was probably due to denaturation of the protein. a similar result was also observed for an antimicrobial compound produced by lactococcus lactis, which was active at the ph range  <dig> to  <dig> and completely inactivated at ph 12
 <cit> .

since bacteriocins are proteinaceous substances, they must be sensitive to at least one proteolytic enzyme
 <cit> . therefore, bacteriocins can be identified in part by exposure to proteolytic enzymes
 <cit> . we found proteolytic enzyme treatment reduced the activity of the antimicrobial compound secreted by kp <dig> . however, activity was not reduced by catalase, indicating that h2o <dig> was not responsible for microbial inhibition, or α-amylase activity, indicating that the compound was not glycosylated, which is characteristic of most bacteriocins
 <cit> . complete inactivation activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k and trypsin, in accordance with a report by albano et al. <cit>  of pediocin pa- <dig> activity
 <cit> . treatment with pepsin did not alter the antimicrobial activity of the blis in this study; however, proteolytic enzymes do not always reduce the antimicrobial activity of a bacteriocin
 <cit> . stability in the presence of a proteolytic enzyme could be due to unusual amino acids in the bacteriocin structure or cyclic n-terminal or c-terminal protected peptides
 <cit> .

we conclude that isolate kp <dig>  is a potential probiotic that may exert beneficial positive effects on intestinal flora, because the strain is tolerant of bile salts  and acidic conditions . to better understand its potential as a probiotic, future studies are needed to characterize the interactions of this p. acidilactici strain to the intestinal mucosal epithelium.
