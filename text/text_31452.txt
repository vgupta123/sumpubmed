BACKGROUND
globins constitute a large superfamily of heme-binding proteins that are encountered in all the kingdoms of life  <cit> . globin polypeptides typically comprise  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues that are folded into a characteristic three dimensional structure, the globin fold: six to eight α-helical segments connected by short loops form a helical sandwich that encloses non-covalently bound heme within a cavity of hydrophobic residues. single globin units can aggregate or fuse with each other or with other polypeptide chains to form a bewildering complexity of quaternary structures including monomers, dimeric, tetrameric and polymeric forms, multi-subunit and multi-domain, multi-subunit proteins, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda in size  <cit> . the evolution of these high molecular weight structures is likely linked with their extracellular occurrence to avoid elimination from the extracellular fluid by excretory processes. the a and g helices of many annelid and vestimentiferan globins contain cysteine residues that readily form cystine bridges with other globin units, and linker polypeptides forming high molecular weight aggregates  <cit> . concatenation of globin domains resulting from gene duplication also results in increases in mr and can be combined with further aggregation. these structures are found in nematodes, some bivalve molluscs and crustaceans  <cit>  .

globins have been called respiratory proteins because transport and facilitation of diffusion of oxygen to the mitochondria are the predominant and first established functions of vertebrate globins. a role in no metabolism was only recently demonstrated for these proteins  <cit> . functions identified for nonvertebrate globins are much more diverse and also include oxygen sensing, storage or scavenging reactions with sulphate, and oxidase and peroxidase activities .

nematodes express several globins, including cellular, perienteric and cuticular isoforms. some of them likely function in facilitating respiration. enoplus brevis expresses large quantities of globin in the pharynx which enables this species to feed efficiently at low po <dig>  nippostrongylus brasiliensis, an intestinal parasite of rat and mouse contains  <dig> globin isoforms, one localized in the body wall and the other in the cuticle. both globins have oxygen affinities 100-fold higher than the rodent host's hemoglobins and likely serve to shuttle oxygen from the worm's gut to its tissues  <cit> . other nematode globins have unprecedented functions. the globin molecule which is abundantly present in the perienteric fluid of ascaris lumbricoides is an octamer of didomain globin polypeptides. it binds molecular oxygen more than  <dig>  fold stronger than vertebrate myoglobin  <cit> , excluding a function in o <dig> transport. its function is still unknown. suggested roles include providing heme to the oocytes , assisting sterol biosynthesis  <cit> , acting as a nadph-dependent reductase for cytochrome c  <cit>  and scavenging oxygen by oxygenating no  <cit> . mermis nigrescens, a parasite nematode of grass hoppers, has two cellular globin isoforms, that are 84% identical. the body isoform presumably acts as a myoglobin, but the other isoform is very highly expressed in the ocellus of mature phototactic females, where it forms intracellular crystals and likely acts as a shading pigment  <cit> .

the finding of a first globin gene in the genome of c. elegans more than a decade ago  <cit>  was surprising since these small animals were generally thought to rely entirely on diffusion for gaseous exchange. however, careful in silico analysis of the genome of c. elegans has revealed the presence of more than  <dig> proteins that are predicted to exhibit or to contain globin or globin-like domains and could be aligned so as to fit determinants of the globin fold  <cit> . c. elegans is a small  free-living soil nematode. this species has two sexes, hermaphrodites and males, but the latter comprise only about  <dig> %– <dig> % of the population. the life cycle consists of four larval stages  and the adult stage, separated by molts. when exposed to unfavorable conditions of crowding, high temperature and scarcity of food, a second stage larva can enter diapause and molt to a dauer larva, a facultative and specialized l <dig> stage that does not feed, is resistant to harsh environmental conditions and can survive up to eight times the normal 3-week life span of animals that have bypassed this stage. entry and exit from the dauer stage is controlled by interacting neuroendocrine signaling, including tgf-β, ins/igf- <dig>  cyclic nucleotide and gonadal signaling. the metabolic adaptations of dauer diapause are controlled by ins/igf- <dig> signaling. insulin-like peptides can bind on the unique ins/igf-1-like receptor encoded by the daf- <dig> gene. upon binding insulin ligand, daf- <dig>  activates a signaling cascade that phosphorylates the foxo transcription factor daf- <dig>  daf- <dig> resides in the nucleus but relocates to the cytoplasm and is inactive when phosphorylated. thus daf- <dig> is negatively regulated by daf- <dig>  in the nucleus daf- <dig> can activate an enhanced life maintenance program, characterized by alterations in energy and intermediate metabolism, elevated stress resistance and prolonged survival. animals carrying partial loss-of-function alleles  of daf- <dig> form dauers constitutively. e <dig> is a temperature-sensitive allele permitting normal development at the permissive temperature . when the culture temperature is raised to 25°c after development to l <dig>  the animals grow to adults that exhibit several characteristics of the dauer stage, and live twice as long as wild-type animals  <cit> . a signal from the gonad also regulates life span in c. elegans. a lipophilic hormone synthesized in the somatic gonad by the cytochrome p <dig> homolog daf- <dig> binds and activates the nuclear receptor daf- <dig> in responsive cells, where daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> co-regulate transcription of downstream effectors of diapause. this pathway also enables integration of signals from the reproductive system with daf- <dig> activation to modulate life span  <cit> .

here, we investigate the structure of the globin genes and the amino acid sequence of the gene products by computational analysis of the genomes of c. elegans and of c. briggsae  <cit> , one of its closest relatives, and by sequence analysis of the transcribed messages. we examine the expression profile of the globin family during the progression of the life cycle and we find that distinct subsets of the globins are differentially regulated in dauers and long-lived daf- <dig> mutant animals. several globin genes are upregulated following anoxia and we find that both hif- <dig> and daf- <dig> function is required for this response to oxygen deprivation.

RESULTS
identification of putative globins and validation of the covalent structures
a previous report by hoogewijs et al.  <cit>  revealed the presence of  <dig> putative globins in the genome of c. elegans. a more stringent analysis using the sequence-structure homology recognition tool fugue  <cit>  reduced this number to  <dig>  still a number by far not reached in any other organism studied to date  <cit> , second only to the larvae of the insect chironomus with over  <dig> globin genes  <cit> . all putative globin genes have orthologous genes in c. briggsae with identities ranging from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. screening of the recently published draft genomic sequence of c. remanei also indicated the presence of an ortholog for each candidate globin gene. the putative globin genes are distributed over all  <dig> chromosomes and no clusters are found, with the exception of c18c <dig>  and c18c <dig>  which are separated by only  <dig> kb. ten of the  <dig> putative globins are located on chromosome v .

comparison of the predicted c. elegans and c. briggsae orthologs was very helpful in delineating potentially wrongly predicted portions. the globin orthologs from these species have blast e-values ranging from about e- <dig> to e- <dig> and the aligned sequences show very few sequence changes. portions that are conspicuously dissimilar delineate inaccurate sequence prediction. we found that all the genes listed in table  <dig> are transcribed, but that  <dig> genes are partially wrongly predicted. internal annotation errors could be readily corrected by rt-pcr. 5' and 3' race experiments were needed for correcting n- and c-terminal annotation errors. the predicted orfs for the genes y58a7a. <dig> and f21a <dig>  were corrected in successive wormpep versions in wormbase in the course of this study as well. the orf for the gene c18c <dig>  was also changed, but we found that it was still mispredicted. a comparison of the c26c <dig>  predicted genomic sequence and our cdna sequence revealed that the first met residue in the n-terminal sequence of c26c <dig>  predicted by genefinder is incorrect. the predicted sequence of c28f <dig>  was corrected at the amino terminus . several of the wrongly predicted genes needed multiple corrections. c18c <dig>  needed correction at the n-terminus and insertion of an additional internal exon, and a large c-terminal portion of the annotated gene turns out to be part of a 3' utr, due to a frame shift caused by a  <dig> bp insertion compared to the predicted sequence. the predicted sequence of t06a <dig>  needed an internal correction in the f helix and incorporation of the annotated t06a <dig>  gene at its amino terminus. the predicted sequence of y22d7ar. <dig>  was corrected at its c-terminus by subsuming y22d7ar. <dig> into it. the c. briggsae ortholog found in wormbase also lacks f, g and h helix, but its twinscan prediction  aligns very well with our corrected sequence. altogether, the predictions for the genes y58a7a. <dig>  f21a <dig> , c18c <dig> , c26c <dig> , c28f <dig> , t06a <dig>  and y22d7ar. <dig> were fully corrected. eventually we could validate the primary structures of all  <dig> putative globins. interestingly, several of these show homology to vertebrate neuroglobin and cytoglobin, as revealed by blast searches .

wide diversity in the primary structures
the profiles of all candidate globins are listed in table  <dig>  the total length ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  amino acid residues. a typical globin domain comprises ~ <dig> residues. the increase in length is caused by n- and/or c-terminal and, more exceptionally, internal extensions. a sequence alignment of all  <dig> globins is provided in additional file  <dig>  nine sequences were extracted from this alignment block and are shown in fig.  <dig> to illustrate structural features discussed in the text. all sequences can be aligned to fit the globin fold, displaying f8his and several other globin signatures, including cd1phe, e7his or gln. however, six putative globins have leu , ile , tyr , met  or val  instead of phe at cd <dig> and four have ile  or val  instead of his or gln at e <dig>  c-terminal extensions  are found in  <dig> putative globins, whereas n-terminal extensions  are found in  <dig> putative globins. interestingly, several prediction programs  revealed that the n-terminal portion of y75b7al. <dig> has the structural characteristics of a g-coupled receptor-like containing  <dig> putative transmembrane helices. internal gh interhelical extensions of unusual length are seen in f49e <dig>  , r <dig>  , c52a <dig>  , c06e <dig>  , c09h <dig>   and y22d7ar. <dig> . t19c <dig>  displays an alternative splice variant and features f8asn instead of f8his, whereas its c. briggsae homolog contains f8his. moreover amino acid sequence comparison of both orthologs reveals that the globin domain differs only in  <dig> aa and fugue still defines it as a globin. as the functionally essential histidine at helix position f <dig> has been replaced by asparagine, precluding proper heme binding, t19c <dig>  was omitted from our globin set.

no conservation of intron insertion patterns
vertebrate globins genes typically have two introns inserted at conserved positions b <dig>   and g <dig> , whereas plant globin genes have an extra intron at e <dig>  and most insect globin genes contain no intervening sequences  <cit> . we have compared the exon/intron patterns among all  <dig> putative globin genes in fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  strikingly, no conservation is discernible neither in the number of introns  and exons  nor in the exon/intron boundaries. examination of the intron insertion positions showed an even more remarkable diversity. the number of introns that interrupt the globin domain ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; 1– <dig> and 1– <dig> introns are inserted in the pre-a and post-h portions of the proteins, respectively. in the globin domain,  <dig> different insertion positions can be found of which most are unprecedented. many positions are found in interhelical segments,  <dig> in the gh interhelix from which  <dig> are located in gh interhelical extensions. only one globin gene  features both conserved vertebrate insertion sites b <dig>  and g <dig> . fourteen of the  <dig> putative globin genes display  <dig> intron insertions in the globin domain,  <dig> of them feature  <dig> interruptions in the globin domain.

developmental expression pattern
to establish the pattern of globin gene expression throughout the life cycle of the animal, we studied highly synchronized developmental staged c. elegans using rt-pcr, including embryo's , l <dig>  l <dig>  dauers, l <dig>  l <dig>  and young adults . differences in expression levels between developmental stages were evaluated more accurately using quantitative rt-pcr. we examined the expression levels of the globin family in l <dig> and dauers, relative to wild-type young adults. biological replicates were done on  <dig> independent worm cultures. several globin genes  are similarly upregulated in l <dig> and dauers relative to young adults, although some reach significance in dauers only . many genes exhibited more than 2- fold upregulation but didn't reach statistical significance because strong upregulation was only seen in  <dig> biological replicates . remarkably, we observed a significant downregulation in l <dig> stage relative to young adults for c26c <dig> , t22c <dig>  and zk <dig> . a similar trend was seen in dauers. interestingly, c26c <dig>  was the only globin which was expressed at a significantly higher level in dauers relative to l <dig> 

we also used quantitative real-time rt-pcr experiments to compare the relative abundance of all  <dig> globins in wild type adults . results demonstrate that t22c <dig>  and zk <dig>  are expressed at substantially higher levels. the difference with the other globins ranges within 1– <dig> orders of magnitude.

anoxia-induced globin expression
to investigate which globins might be upregulated in response to oxygen deprivation we subjected young adult worms  to anoxic conditions for  <dig> h. rna was subsequently prepared and amplified by quantitative rt-pcr. a separate viability assay showed that more than 90% of the worm population remained viable under these conditions, and they recovered within  <dig> h under normoxic conditions. our criteria for differential regulation were:  two-fold difference in expression with matched samples, and  non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. six genes  met both these criteria and are referred to as anoxia-responsive. t22c <dig>  and c18c <dig>  exhibited greater than 2-fold upregulation by anoxia but didn't reach statistical significance  as  <dig> biological replicate showed only moderate upregulation. expression of w01c <dig>  and y75b7al. <dig> was induced  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these four genes are referred to as likely anoxia-responsive . none of the  <dig> globin transcripts in n <dig> worms showed reduction in expression under anoxia.

three  out of the  <dig> anoxia-responsive genes displayed sequence similarity to vertebrate cytoglobin, whereas none of the five genes that showed homology to vertebrate neuroglobin was induced by oxygen deprivation . interestingly, a similar lack of hypoxic response was reported for vertebrate neuroglobin  <cit> .

hif- <dig> dependent globin genes
to find out whether hif- <dig>  was required for regulation of the anoxia-responsive genes, we measured the expression levels of the proven and likely anoxia-responsive genes listed in fig.  <dig> in hif- <dig> mutants grown in normoxic and anoxic conditions. zk <dig> , which is anoxia-insensitive in wild-type worms but strongly induced in adult daf- <dig>  was also included in this assay. the non-globin, hif- <dig> dependent gene f22b <dig>   was used as a positive control  <cit> . f22b <dig>  was expressed at lower levels under both normoxia and hypoxia in hif- <dig> defective animals, as expected  <cit> , but to our surprise all hypoxia-sensitive globins tended  to be expressed at higher levels in hif- <dig> compared to wild-type animals. however none of them was differentially regulated under anoxia in hif- <dig> defective mutant worms, indicating that they are hif- <dig> dependent .

additionally, candidate regulatory regions were examined for putative hypoxia-responsive sequence elements . results indicate the presence of candidate hif- <dig> binding elements in the genomic region of all anoxia-induced globin genes.

daf-2- and daf-16-regulated globin gene expression
since daf- <dig> mutant worms are hypoxia tolerant  <cit> , we anticipated that some globin genes might be constitutively upregulated in these animals. to our surprise we found only minor changes in transcription levels compared to wild-type worms , except for zk <dig>  which was significantly upregulated by 4-fold. none of the hif- <dig> dependent globin genes was significantly induced by anoxia in the daf- <dig> animals. three globin genes  were significantly downregulated under normoxic conditions .

to understand how daf- <dig> exerts its effect on zk <dig>  we compared the expression level of this globin in daf- <dig> and daf-2;daf- <dig> mutant worms relative to daf- <dig> . we found that the expression of zk <dig>  was reduced by 4-fold in daf- <dig> and daf-2;daf- <dig> animals indicating that zk <dig>  is regulated by daf- <dig> in a daf- <dig> dependent fashion. computational analysis of the zk <dig>  genomic region detected the presence of a daf- <dig> binding element at position - <dig>  providing additional support for daf-16-mediated regulation.

since the hif- <dig> dependent globin genes were not induced by anoxia in daf- <dig> mutants we expected that daf- <dig> would not mediate or rather oppose their induction upon anoxia. we found that all anoxia inducible globin genes are upregulated in daf- <dig> animals under anoxic conditions, albeit at a lower level relative to wild-type worms .

daf- <dig> modulates hif- <dig> expression
to learn more about the role of daf- <dig> in the response to anoxia we measured the expression of hif- <dig> in daf- <dig> and wild-type animals. daf- <dig> is a very severe mutation that nearly fully disrupts the function of daf- <dig>  we found that transcription of hif- <dig> in the animals lacking daf- <dig> activity was lower under normoxia in each of four independent trials, but this difference was not statistically significant . however, expression of hif- <dig> was reduced by more than  <dig> -fold  under anoxic conditions in these animals .

discussion
structural diversity
the finding of a globin sequence in the genome of caenorhabditis elegans was unexpected because it was generally felt that due to the small size of this organism sufficient quantities of oxygen could reach the sites of oxygen consumption by simple diffusion, and for about a decade it was thought that globin zk <dig>  was the only globin species expressed in c. elegans  <cit> . however, the completion of the genome sequence of this species and the development of powerful gene prediction tools has now led to the identification of at least  <dig> putative globin genes that are all expressed. so, the paramount question arises whether these globins have distinct functional properties, or represent structural variations of the core globin and exhibit large redundancy. usually such multigene families cluster together and the individual members become substrates for purifying or positive selection depending on the evolving function. chironomid larvae live in low oxygen habitats and selection likely favored high copy number of similar genes to synthesize more hemoglobin. several of these are stage-specific  <cit> . because of the small size and terrestrial habitat of c. elegans it is likely that most globins in this species were selected for reasons other than enhancing hemoglobin synthesis capacity. the low transcript abundance of the globin genes also argues against such a role. even globin zk <dig> , which has the second largest transcript abundancy is expressed in a subset of cells  <cit> . we found no evidence of recent gene duplication events, and the huge diversity seen in the primary structures of the proteins suggests a long evolutionary history. taken together, these aspects of low expression and huge sequence diversity may indicate that most, if not all, of these globin genes are cell or stage specific, and that they have diverged to perform specialized functions.

the wide diversity in the gene structures, as shown by the marked variability of intron insertion patterns is in line with this view. vertebrate globins genes typically have two introns inserted at conserved positions b <dig>  and g <dig> , whereas plant globin genes have an extra intron at e <dig> . it was speculated that the  <dig> exons,  <dig> introns arrangement is ancestral and that evolution sometimes led to elimination of introns, particularly in bacteria, yeast and some insects  <cit> . as the positions of these canonical introns appear to divide the globin gene into functional domains, it was hypothesized that they witness the joining of functional exons to create the globin core unit early in evolution  <cit> . although later studies demonstrated that there is no such general correlation of exon boundaries in genes with domain boundaries in proteins  <cit> , it was thought that introns in eukaryotic genes witness the gene organization of the last universal common ancestor of cellular life, and that evolution sometimes led to their total  or partial  elimination  <cit> . this introns-early view was challenged by the intron-late hypothesis  <cit>  which holds that introns in eukaryote genomes evolved after the split of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. this debate still persists  <cit> . the central question is how the complex eukaryotic spliceosomal machinery could have evolved. self-splicing group i and group ii introns are found in prokaryotes, but spliceosomal introns are a hallmark of eukaryotic genomes. a reconciling hypothesis holds that spliceosomal introns co-evolved with the origin of the eukaryote ancestor: an archaebacterial host acquired an α-proteobacterial symbiont . group ii introns from this symbiont invaded the hosts' genome and evolved to spliceosomal introns  <cit> . this initial intron invasion would have ended when the original intron-encoded protein was no longer required and was exposed to mutational demise. it is likely that introns that are inserted at very conservative positions throughout the evolution  are descendants of these founder introns. these, and many other introns have been lost and many other introns have been acquired more recently in nematodes. it is thought that these introns were gained by a fundamentally different process, likely reverse splicing of preexisting introns  <cit> . the lack of any conspicuous pattern of introns positioning in the globin genes of c. elegans reflects a dynamic pattern of intron insertion events, consistent with this hypothesis. minor variability in intron positioning has been described for the cytochrome p <dig>  <cit>  and dead helicase gene families  <cit>  of c. elegans, however. the mechanisms controlling the stringent or more relaxed exon-intron pattern is currently not understood. a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary history of the globin protein family in the genus caenorhabditis will be described elsewhere.

anoxia-responsive globins
as a first approach to establish their functions, we have studied the expression profiles of these putative globins under normoxia and anoxia. c. elegans is a soil inhabiting nematode which relies on oxygen consumption by the mitochondria to maintain normal metabolic function. in the laboratory the worms are usually grown on agar plates, where they are exposed to normal atmospheric air, which contains  <dig> % oxygen or approx.  <dig> mg oxygen/l air. oxygen supply will be lower in moist soil, mainly due to the poor solubility of oxygen in water, which is reduced to approx.  <dig>  mg/l water at 20°c. c. elegans is able to maintain a constant metabolic rate when the oxygen concentration in air is lowered to approx.  <dig>  %, and reduces respiration by 50% at  <dig> % oxygen . thus water-logged or flooded soils rapidly become hypoxic and, not surprisingly, c. elegans has developed a response to cope with reduced oxygen supply. the animals can continue to develop and reproduce down to  <dig> – <dig>  % gaseous oxygen by activation of a hypoxia responsive pathway  <cit> . below this threshold they can relay on suspended animation for survival under anoxia and hif- <dig> is not required  <cit> . however, our findings demonstrate that some globins are upregulated under conditions of total oxygen deprivation. one possible explanation of this finding is that the induction of these genes by hypoxia is quite fast and 'frozen' in this state under anoxia.

only  <dig>  perhaps  <dig>  out of the  <dig> globins were anoxia-responsive. three out of  <dig> cytoglobin-like and none of the  <dig> neuroglobin-like proteins were upregulated under conditions of oxygen deprivation, in agreement with most mammalian globin expression studies  <cit> . the lack of significant difference in expression under normoxic and anoxic conditions in hif- <dig> mutant worms leads to the conclusion that all anoxia responsive globin genes are regulated by a hif- <dig> mediated mechanism. computational analysis of the globin genomic regions detected the presence of putative hypoxia-responsive sequence elements in all anoxia-induced globin genes, providing additional support for hif-1-mediated upregulation. these globins are also induced under normoxia in hif- <dig> mutants , suggesting a more complex regulation that is able to compensate for the loss of hif- <dig> function.

y75b7al. <dig> was mildly induced by anoxia, reaching significance in one set of experiments only , and required intact hif- <dig> activity for adaptation to anoxia. prediction programs identify y75b7al. <dig> as a chimeric protein consisting of a g-coupled receptor domain containing  <dig> transmembrane helices and a globin domain. its structural properties suggest that this protein may act as an oxygen sensor. the oxygen dependent expression of this globin is surprising since such regulation is unprecedented to date. a chimeric protein comprising a guanylate cyclase and a haem binding domain was recently reported to sense oxygen and to regulate aerotaxis responses  <cit> .

expression of globin zk <dig>  is regulated by insulin/igf- <dig> signaling and not induced by anoxia
since both dauers and daf- <dig> mutant animals are hypoxia resistant  <cit>  we anticipated that they might constitutively express a subset of globin genes at higher levels. however, we found to our surprise a rather dissimilar pattern of globin regulation in these animals, as summarized in table  <dig>  several globins were borderline  upregulated in dauers , but not in daf- <dig> mutant worms. zk <dig>  was substantially upregulated in daf- <dig> adults in a daf-16-dependent fashion. this globin molecule was expressed at lower levels in l <dig> and borderline  upregulated in the alternative dauer stage. interestingly, regulation of transcription of this globin species was not sensitive to anoxia. since suspended daf- <dig> signaling induces enhanced life maintenance it is tempting to anticipate that zk <dig>  contributes to these processes.

multiple pathways control expression of the anoxia responsive globin genes
surprisingly, none of the hif- <dig> responsive globin genes was induced when daf- <dig> mutant animals were exposed to  <dig> h of oxygen deprivation . thus induction of these genes by anoxia requires both hif- <dig> and daf- <dig> function. this could indicate that hif- <dig> mediates induction of these genes upon anoxia treatment and that hif- <dig> activity is modulated by insulin/igf- <dig> signaling, or that hif- <dig> and daf- <dig> each act to regulate the expression of these globin genes.

the data presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> provide support for the first model: reduced levels of hif- <dig> mrna were measured in animals lacking daf- <dig> function and the induction of the globins in response to anoxia was weakened in these mutants. the finding that anoxic treatment fails to induce the hif- <dig> responsive globin genes in animals lacking daf- <dig> function leads to an apparent contradiction, however: daf- <dig> activity which is negatively regulated by daf- <dig> is expected to be fully active in these animals and hif- <dig> would be expected to be fully expressed. yet the globin genes were not induced upon anoxic treatment in these mutants. to explain this we propose a model in which daf- <dig> opposes the expression of these globins, directly or indirectly. direct inhibition could result from competition of hif- <dig> and daf- <dig> for the hif- <dig> responsive promoters. this explanation would imply that daf- <dig> can bind to but not activate these promoters. this is opposite to globin zk <dig>  which is clearly induced by daf- <dig> but not hif- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the globin gene family of c. elegans. we illustrate the remarkable structural diversity of this gene family, pointing to a functional variety. in this study we demonstrate significant differential expression of the c. elegans globin gene family upon anoxia. studying expression profiles in different mutant worms has enabled us to provide initial evidence of linked hif- <dig> and ins/igf- <dig> signaling for globin regulation under severe hypoxic conditions in the nematode.

we assume that in a natural environment hif- <dig> responsive globins are "on" when daf- <dig> is "on" i.e. when the conditions for growth and reproduction are favorable. scarcity of oxygen in otherwise permissive conditions is remedied by the action of hif- <dig>  adverse conditions for growth and reproduction  lead to reduced daf- <dig> signaling and increasing silencing of the hif responsive globin promoters by the daf- <dig> foxo transcription factor. in contrast, globin zk <dig>  is induced and may contribute to the life maintenance program that is deployed under these conditions.
