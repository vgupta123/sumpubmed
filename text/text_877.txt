BACKGROUND
homeobox genes are characterized by the possession of a particular dna sequence, the homeobox, which encodes a recognizable although very variable protein domain, the homeodomain  <cit> . most homeodomains are  <dig> amino acids in length, although exceptions are known. many homeodomain proteins are transcription factors with important roles in embryonic patterning and cell differentiation, and several have been implicated in human diseases and congenital abnormalities  <cit> .

the homeobox genes have been variously subdivided into superclasses, classes, subclasses or groups, although there has been much inconsistency in the use of these terms. the most commonly recognized groupings are the antp, prd, lim, pou, hnf, sine, tale, cut, pros and zf groups , although these are not always given equal rank in classification schemes  <cit> . there is more consensus in classification at a lower level, just above the level of the gene, where very similar genes are grouped into gene families. widely recognized gene families include dlx, evx, msx, cdx, en, otx, pitx, otx and emx , amongst many others, although there is variation particularly concerning how many gene families are used for the hox, pax and nk homeobox genes. despite the numerous discrepancies, the common principle of classification is the same. the goal of any scheme is to mirror evolutionary diversification, so that 'closely related' genes are placed in the same gene family, and related gene families are placed in the same gene class or other higher grouping. it should be borne in mind, however, that the pathway of evolutionary diversification is never completely known for any large and complex set of genes.

the initial analyses of the draft human genome sequence published in  <dig> included estimates of the number of human homeobox genes. venter et al  <cit>  found  <dig> homeobox genes, containing  <dig> homeobox sequences, using large-scale automated classification; while the ihgsc team  <cit>  gave a much higher estimate of  <dig> homeobox genes. both were based on draft coverage of the human genome and would be expected to be missing some genes, as well as confusing pseudogenes with genes. in the same year, banerjee-basu and baxevanis  <cit>  presented an analysis of  <dig> human homeodomain sequences, but this was far from a comprehensive survey. more recently, there have been two more accurate surveys of homeobox genes in the human genome. nam and nei  <cit>  found  <dig> homeobox genes, containing  <dig> homeobox sequences. ryan et al  <cit>  found  <dig> homeodomain sequences in the ncbi refseq database of october  <dig>  our analyses  revealed many homeobox genes that were incorrectly annotated, named or classified and many homeobox pseudogenes that had previously been missed. we report a complete survey of homeobox loci in the euchromatic regions of the human genome, appropriate gene nomenclature and a consistent classification scheme.

RESULTS
how many homeobox genes and pseudogenes?
using exhaustive database screening, followed by manual examination of sequences, we identified  <dig> homeobox loci in the human genome. distinguishing which of these loci are functional genes and which are non-functional pseudogenes was difficult in some cases. most loci classified as pseudogenes in this study are integrated reverse-transcribed transcripts, readily recognized by their dispersed genomic location, complete lack of intron sequences, and  3' homopolymeric run of adenine residues. a small minority are duplicated copies of genes, recognized by physical linkage to their functional counterparts and the same  exon-intron arrangement. in general, retrotransposed gene copies are non-functional  from the moment of integration because they lack 5' promoter regions necessary for transcription. however, such sequences can occasionally acquire new promoters and become functional as 'retrogenes'. duplicated gene copies often possess 5'promoter regions ; most degenerate to pseudogenes due to redundancy in a process known as non-functionalization, however some can be preserved as functional genes through sub- or neo-functionalization. thus, in both instances, reliable indicators of non-functionality were sought in order to assign pseudogene status, notably frameshift mutations, premature stop codons and non-synonymous substitutions at otherwise conserved sites in the original coding region.

we currently estimate that the  <dig> human homeobox loci comprise  <dig> functional genes and  <dig> pseudogenes . these figures include three functional genes that possess partial homeobox sequences  and retrotransposed pseudogenes that correspond to only part of the original transcript, whether or not it includes the homeobox region or indeed any of the original coding region. consequently,  <dig> retrotransposed pseudogenes that lack homeobox sequences are included . we do not include pax <dig>  pax <dig> and cers1; these are functional genes without homeobox motifs, albeit closely related to true homeobox genes .

aincludes pax <dig>  pax <dig> and pax <dig> that have a partial homeobox; excludes pax <dig> and pax <dig> that lack a homeobox.

bincludes nanogp <dig> that lacks a homeobox.

cexcludes intronless and repetitive dux <dig> to dux <dig> sequences.

dincludes tprx1p <dig> and tprx1p <dig> that lack a homeobox.

eincludes pou5f1p <dig> and pou5f1p <dig> that lack a homeobox.

fincludes irx4p <dig>  tgif2p <dig>  tgif2p <dig> and tgif2p <dig> that lack a homeobox.

gincludes cux2p <dig>  cux2p <dig> and satb1p <dig> that lack a homeobox.

hincludes zeb2p <dig> that lacks a homeobox.

iexcludes cers <dig> that lacks a homeobox.

the total number of homeobox sequences in the human genome is higher than  <dig> for two reasons. first, several genes and pseudogenes possess more than one homeobox sequence, notably members of the dux , zfhx and zhx/homez gene families. second, we have excluded a set of sequences related to human dux <dig> , which have become part of  <dig>  kb repetitive dna elements present in multiple copies in the genome  <cit> . few of these tandemly-repeated sequences are likely to be functional as expressed proteins, and all were probably derived by retrotransposition from functional dux gene transcripts . the fact that they are not included in the total count, therefore, is likely to have limited bearing on understanding the diversity and normal function of human homeobox genes. hence, our figure of  <dig> homeobox loci is the most useful current estimate of the repertoire of human homeobox genes and pseudogenes.

classification
we propose a simple classification scheme for homeobox genes, based on two principal ranks: gene class and gene family. a gene class contains one or more gene families, which in turn will contain one or more genes. in a few cases, it is useful to erect an intermediate rank between these levels, and for this we use the term subclass. for the entire set of homeobox genes, we use the term superclass.

for the rank of gene family, we use a specific evolutionary-based definition based on common practice in the field of comparative genomics and developmental biology. we define a gene family as a set of genes derived from a single gene in the most recent common ancestor of bilaterian animals . this definition has been made explicitly in previous work  <cit>  but is actually a principle that has been in widespread, but rather inconsistent, use for over a decade  <cit> . for example, amongst the homeobox genes, the en  gene family was originally defined to include human en <dig> and en <dig>  plus drosophila en and inv  <cit> ; these four genes arose by independent duplication from a single gene in the most recent common ancestor of insects and vertebrates. moving outside the homeobox genes, this principle is also widespread; for example, the hh  gene family was defined to include mouse shh, dhh and ihh, plus drosophila hh  <cit> . to clarify boundaries between gene families, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of human homeodomain sequences, using a range of protostome and occasionally cnidarian homeodomain sequences as outgroups .

while the gene family definition described above is generally workable for homeobox genes, by necessity there are some exceptions. one type of exception relates to genes with an unknown ancestral number. for example, there is uncertainty as to whether there were one or two dlx  genes in the most recent common ancestor of bilaterians; however it is common practice to refer to a single dlx gene family  <cit> . thus, we stick with convention for this set of genes. there is similar uncertainty over the ancestral number of irx  genes  <cit> , and again we treat these as a single gene family. the hox genes are an interesting case as their precise number in the most recent common ancestor of bilaterians is unknown due to lack of phylogenetic resolution between 'central' genes  <cit> . here we divide the hox genes into seven gene families: the 'anterior' hox <dig> and hox <dig> gene families, the 'group 3' hox <dig> gene family, the 'central' hox <dig>  hox <dig> and hox6- <dig> gene families, and the 'posterior' hox9- <dig> gene family. another type of exception relates to 'orphan' genes. these are genes that have been found in one species  but not in other species, or at least not in a wide diversity of metazoa. some of these will be ancient genes that have been secondarily lost from the genomes of some species, in which case these comply with our evolutionary definition of a gene family made above. others, however, will be rapidly evolving genes that originated from another homeobox gene and then diverged to such an extent that their origins are unclear  <cit> . whenever origins are unclear, we must define a new gene family to encompass those genes, even though they may not date back to the latest common ancestor of bilaterians. in these cases, the gene family is erected to recognize a set of distinct genes on the basis of dna and protein sequence, rather than on evolutionary origins.

using the aforementioned criteria, we recognize  <dig> homeobox gene families in the human genome . we are aware that other homeobox gene families exist in bilaterians but have been lost from humans , and we recognize that some gene family boundaries will alter as new information is obtained. nonetheless, at the present time the  <dig> gene families provide a sound framework for the study of human homeobox genes.

it is much more difficult to propose a rigorous evolutionary definition for the rank of gene class. every attempt to classify genes above the level of gene family involves a degree of arbitrariness. we define gene classes by taking two principal criteria into account. first, gene classes should ideally be monophyletic assemblages of gene families. to identify probable monophyletic groups of gene families, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of homeodomain sequences, and looked for sets of gene families that group together stably, regardless of the precise composition of the dataset used . some gene families were difficult to place from sequence data alone, and were found in different gene classes  depending on the precise dataset analyzed or the phylogenetic method employed. this is perhaps not surprising as trees that encompass many homeobox genes can only be built with a short sequence alignment ; under these conditions, phylogenetic trees can only be used as a guide to possible classification, not the absolute truth. in ambiguous cases, we used the chromosomal location of genes to guide possible resolution between alternative hypotheses. second, some homeobox gene classes can be characterized by the presence of additional protein domains outside of the homeodomain  <cit> . recognized protein domains associated with homeodomains include the prd domain, lim domain, pou-specific domain, pou-like domain, six domain, various meinox-related domains, the cut domain, pros domain, and various zf domains  <cit> .

using the aforementioned criteria, we recognize eleven homeobox gene classes in the human genome: antp, prd, lim, pou, hnf, sine, tale, cut, pros, zf and cers . there is no expectation that the eleven gene classes will be of similar size, simply because some classes will have undergone more expansion by gene duplication than others. in the human genome, the antp and prd classes are much larger than the other classes. although gene classes should ideally be monophyletic, it is possible that the zf homeobox gene class, characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs in most of its members, is polyphyletic . in other words, domain shuffling may have brought together a homeobox sequence and a zinc finger sequence on more than one occasion. the same may also be true for the lim class; alternatively the apparent polyphyly of lim-class homeodomains could be a consequence of lim domain loss or artefactual placement of some zf-class homeodomains in phylogenetic analyses .

in theory, it is possible to recognize higher level associations above the level of the gene class, because the diversification of homeobox genes will have taken place by a continual series of gene duplication events. we do not propose names for hierarchical levels above the rank of class, and consider that gene name, gene family and gene class  convey sufficient information for most purposes.

we use a consistent convention for writing gene classes and gene families. we present the names of all gene classes in abbreviated non-italicized upper case – for example, the antp and prd classes – to avoid confusion with gene symbols  or indeed gene names . in contrast, we present the names of all gene families in non-italicized title case; for example, the cdx, en and gsc gene families. we have used this style consistently in recent work  <cit>  and note that several other authors have done likewise  <cit> . we suggest that this style, and most of these gene family names, can be used in other bilaterian genomes. extending the scheme to non-bilaterians is more difficult, however, and awaits clarification of the relationship between the homeobox genes of sponges, placozoans, cnidarians and bilaterians  <cit> .

the antp homeobox class
the antp class derives its name from the antennapedia  gene, one of the hox genes within the ant-c homeotic complex of drosophila melanogaster. the human genome has  <dig> hox genes, arranged into four hox clusters. here we divide the hox genes into seven gene families: hox <dig>  hox <dig>  hox <dig>  hox <dig>  hox <dig>  hox6- <dig> and hox9- <dig>  the hox genes are not the only antp-class genes, and we recognize a total of  <dig> gene families in this class . we divide these  <dig> gene families between two subclasses that are relatively well-supported in phylogenetic analyses: the hoxl and the nkl subclasses . as previously discussed, the subclasses are largely consistent with the chromosomal positions of genes  <cit> . the hoxl  genes primarily map to two fourfold paralogous regions: the hox paralogon  and the parahox paralogon  . the nkl  genes are more dispersed, but there is a concentration on the nkl or metahox paralogon  . somewhat aberrantly, the dlx and en gene families group with the nkl subclass in phylogenetic analyses , but with the hoxl subclass on the basis of chromosomal positions .

most of the  <dig> gene families in the antp class have been clearly defined before. we draw attention here to several cases that could cause confusion. other details can be found in table  <dig> 

human antp class homeobox genes and pseudogenes including full names, chromosomal locations, entrez gene ids and previous symbols. nanogp <dig> is a duplicate of nanog.

∘ cdx, gsx and pdx gene families. some authors refer to the pdx gene family as the xlox gene family  <cit> . one gene from each of these families  forms the parahox cluster at 13q <dig>  , and clustering of cdx, gsx and pdx genes is ancestral for chordates  <cit> .

∘ mnx gene family. this gene family name derives from a previous study  <cit> . the family includes one gene in the human genome: mnx <dig> , and two genes in the chicken genome: mnx <dig>  and mnx <dig> . some authors refer to the mnx gene family as the exex gene family due to the drosophila ortholog exex  <cit> .

∘ dlx gene family. it is currently unclear if this gene family is derived from one or more genes in the common ancestor of bilaterians  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses place this gene family firmly within the nkl subclass , but chromosomal positions  place it within the hoxl subclass . here we favor placement of the dlx gene family within the nkl subclass due to strong phylogenetic support.

∘ en gene family. phylogenetic analyses place this gene family either within the nkl subclass  or close to the division between the nkl and hoxl subclasses . here we place the en gene family within the nkl subclass, although we note that human en <dig> maps close to the clear hoxl-subclass genes gbx <dig> and mnx <dig> on chromosome  <dig> .

∘ nk <dig>  and nk <dig>  gene families. the genes nkx2- <dig> , nkx2- <dig>  nkx2- <dig> and nkx2- <dig> divide into two distinct gene families each with an invertebrate ortholog, not a single nk <dig> gene family. nkx2- <dig> and nkx2- <dig> are collectively orthologous to drosophila scro and amphioxus amphink2- <dig>  <cit> ; these comprise one gene family: nk <dig> . nkx2- <dig> and nkx2- <dig> are collectively orthologous to drosophila vnd and amphioxus amphink2- <dig>  <cit> ; these comprise a second gene family: nk <dig> .

∘ nk <dig> gene family. the genes nkx2- <dig>  nkx2- <dig> and nkx2- <dig> form a gene family, quite distinct from other human genes that confusingly share the prefix nkx <dig>  these three genes are actually orthologs of drosophila tin ; they are not orthologs of drosophila vnd  or scro  <cit> . therefore, they do not belong to the nk <dig>  or nk <dig>  gene families, but belong to a separate nk <dig> gene family. as the three gene names have very extensive current usage, it may be difficult for revised names to be used consistently. in this situation, we don't alter the current names, but raise for discussion the possibility of these genes being renamed to the more logical nkx4- <dig> , nkx4- <dig>  and nkx4- <dig> , or to csx <dig> , csx <dig>  and csx <dig> , based on the alternative name csx <dig> for nkx2- <dig>  <cit> .

∘ noto gene family. this gene family falls close to the division between the antp and prd classes in phylogenetic analyses . we favor placement within the antp class as the human noto gene is chromosomally linked to the clear antp-class  genes emx <dig>  lbx <dig>  tlx <dig> and vax <dig> on chromosome  <dig> , suggesting ancestry by ancient tandem duplication.

most of the  <dig> genes in the antp class have been adequately named previously. however, several genes were unnamed or misnamed prior to this study. we have updated these as follows.

∘ gsx <dig>  is the second of two human members of the gsx gene family. this previously unnamed gene has clear orthology to mouse gsh <dig>  inferred from sequence identity and synteny. we designate the gene gsx <dig> and revise the nomenclature of the other human member of the family from gsh <dig> to gsx <dig> , in accordance with homeobox gene nomenclature convention.

∘ mnx <dig>  is the only member of the mnx gene family in the human genome. this gene was previously known as hlxb9; we rename it mnx <dig> because it is not part of a series of at least nine related genes.

∘ pdx <dig>  is the only member of the pdx gene family in the human genome. this gene was previously known as ipf1; we rename it pdx <dig> because the majority of published studies use this as the gene symbol.

∘ bsx  is the only member of the bsx gene family in the human genome. we designate this previously unnamed gene bsx on the basis of clear orthology to the mouse bsx gene, inferred from sequence identity and synteny.

∘ dbx <dig>  and dbx <dig>  are the only two members of the dbx gene family in the human genome. we designate these previously unnamed genes dbx <dig> and dbx <dig> on the basis of clear orthology to mouse dbx <dig> and dbx <dig>  inferred from sequence identity and synteny.

∘ nkx1- <dig>  and nkx1- <dig>  are the only two members of the nk <dig> gene family in the human genome. these genes were previously known as hspx <dig> and c10orf <dig> respectively; we rename them nkx1- <dig> and nkx1- <dig> on the basis of clear orthology to mouse nkx1- <dig> and nkx1- <dig>  inferred from sequence identity and synteny.

∘ nkx2- <dig>  is the first of two human members of the nk <dig>  gene family. this gene was previously known as titf1; we rename it nkx2- <dig> to show that it is a member of the nk <dig>  gene family.

∘ nkx2- <dig>  is the third of three human members of the nk <dig> gene family. we designate this previously unnamed gene nkx2- <dig> on the basis of clear orthology to mouse nkx2- <dig>  inferred from sequence identity and synteny, although nomenclature revision for the entire nk <dig> gene family should be discussed .

∘ nkx3- <dig>  is the second of two human members of the nk <dig> gene family. this gene was previously known as bapx1; we rename it nkx3- <dig> to show that it is a member of the nk <dig> gene family.

∘ nkx6- <dig>  is the third of three human members of the nk <dig> gene family. we designate this previously unnamed gene nkx6- <dig> on the basis of clear orthology to mouse nkx6- <dig>  inferred from sequence identity and synteny.

∘ ventx  is the only functional member of the ventx gene family in the human genome. this gene was previously known as ventx <dig>  we remove the numerical suffix from this gene symbol because we discovered that the sequence formerly known as ventx <dig> is actually a retrotransposed pseudogene derived from this gene. accordingly, we also replace the ventx <dig> symbol with ventxp <dig> .

in contrast to the previous descriptions of probable functional genes, there has been much less research on pseudogenes within the antp class. eleven pseudogenes derived from the human nanog gene have been described previously  <cit> , while four pseudogenes in the ventx gene family have been reported following routine annotation of the human genome. we have identified two additional ventx-family pseudogenes , and also found two cases of pseudogenes that were originally mistaken for functional genes . in all cases, we have clarified the origins and organization of these pseudogenes. this research brings the total number of antp-class pseudogenes in the human genome to  <dig> 

∘ msx2p <dig> . a short cdna sequence  related to the msx gene family was reported previously  <cit> ; the former entrez gene record labeled hshpx <dig> was based on this sequence. this locus was later provisionally called msx <dig>  as it was distinct from human msx <dig> and msx <dig>  and by synteny it was clearly not the ortholog of mouse msx <dig>  <cit> . it is now clear that this locus was formed by retrotransposition of mrna from msx <dig> and hence we name it msx2p <dig>  the genomic sequence of msx2p <dig> can now be accessed via the reference sequence collection . the pseudogene shares 91% sequence identity with msx <dig> mrna, lacks intronic sequence, and has remnants of a 3' poly tail. it is intriguing, but probably coincidental, that the msx2p <dig> pseudogene has integrated at 17q <dig> , close to several antp-class genes .

∘ nanogp <dig> . we follow booth and holland  <cit>  and classify nanogp <dig> as a pseudogene that arose by tandem duplication of nanog. the alternative view, argued by hart et al  <cit> , is that this locus is a functional gene, and should be named nanog <dig>  there is evidence for transcription of this locus in human embryonic stem cells  <cit> , and for selection-driven conservation of the open reading frame  <cit> , but as yet no clear evidence for function.

∘ nanogp <dig> . we follow booth and holland  <cit>  and classify nanogp <dig> as a retrotransposed pseudogene. the alternative view, argued by zhang et al  <cit> , is that this locus is a functional retrogene. there is evidence for transcription and translation of this locus in cancer cell lines and tumors  <cit> , but no evidence yet for a role in normal tissues.

∘ ventxp <dig> , ventxp <dig> , ventxp <dig>  and ventxp <dig> . these four ventx retrotransposed pseudogenes have been reported previously, and were originally known as ventx2p <dig> to ventx2p <dig>  the correction of the ventx <dig> gene symbol to simply ventx  means that each of the pseudogene names should also change; we rename them ventxp <dig> to ventxp <dig>  ventxp <dig> is transcribed but due to mutations it can no longer encode a homeodomain protein; it can however encode an antigenic peptide  responsible for t-cell stimulation in response to melanoma  <cit> .

∘ ventxp <dig> . we designate this previously unnamed sequence ventxp <dig> because it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of ventx. the genomic sequence of ventxp <dig> can now be accessed via the reference sequence collection . the pseudogene shares 83% identity with ventx mrna , lacks intronic sequence, and has remnants of a 3' poly tail.

∘ ventxp <dig> . we designate this previously unannotated sequence ventxp <dig> because it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of ventx. its lack of annotation may reflect the fact that it is located within an intron of an unrelated and well characterized gene, stau <dig>  the genomic sequence of ventxp <dig> can now be accessed via the reference sequence collection . the pseudogene shares 87% identity with ventx mrna  and lacks intronic sequence.

∘ ventxp <dig> . a short cdna sequence  was reported previously and named hpx <dig>  <cit> . this was later renamed the ventx <dig> gene, after it was found to be related to xenopus ventx-family genes. our analysis of the genomic sequence at this locus reveals that it is actually a retrotransposed pseudogene of the ventx gene ; thus we designate it ventxp <dig>  the genomic sequence of ventxp <dig> can now be accessed via the reference sequence collection . the pseudogene shares 86% identity with ventx mrna , lacks intronic sequence, and has remnants of a 3' poly tail.

one other gene could conceivably be included in the antp class, but is excluded from our survey. this gene , has been annotated as a homeobox gene and is located just  <dig> kb from nanog. however, no homeodomain was detected when the deduced protein was analyzed for conserved domains. also, secondary structure prediction did not predict the expected organisation of alpha helices. alignment with the nanog homeodomain reveals identity of the kq and wf motifs, either side of the same intron position , but few other shared residues. it is possible, but unproven, that the locus arose by tandem duplication of part, or all, of the nanog homeobox gene. this gene has generated two retrotransposed pseudogenes: one at 2q <dig>  and another at 12q <dig> .

the prd homeobox class
the prd class derives its name from the paired  gene of drosophila melanogaster. in previous studies, the prd class has been subdivided in several different ways, often based on identify of the amino acid at residue  <dig> in the homeodomain, for example s <dig>  k <dig> and q <dig>  these categories are not monophyletic groupings of genes and so can be misleading if we aim for a classification scheme that reflects evolution  <cit> . here we divide the prd class into two subclasses of unequal size: the pax subclass , and the paxl subclass  . pax genes are defined by possession of a conserved paired-box motif, distinct from the homeobox, coding for the 128-amino-acid prd domain. of the nine human genes possessing a paired-box , only four also contain a complete homeobox . three genes have a partial homeobox , while two lack a homeobox entirely . phylogenetic analyses using pax genes from a range of species suggest that these are secondary conditions, and that the ancestral pax gene probably possessed both motifs  <cit> . the pax genes do not constitute a single gene family, because it is clear that the latest common ancestor of the bilateria contained four pax genes. three of these are ancestors of the prd-class homeobox gene families pax2/5/ <dig>  pax3/ <dig> and pax4/6; the fourth is the ancestor of pax <dig> and pax <dig>  thus the pax subclass contains three gene families. we divide the paxl subclass into  <dig> gene families, although as explained below not all of these date to the base of the bilateria. thus, we recognize a total of  <dig> gene families in the prd class .

many of the  <dig> gene families in the prd class have been clearly defined before. we draw attention here to newly defined gene families and cases that could cause confusion. other details can be found in table  <dig> 

human prd class homeobox genes and pseudogenes including full names, chromosomal locations, entrez gene ids and previous symbols. pax2/5/8-family genes contain a partial homeobox. rhoxf2b is a duplicate of rhoxf <dig>  tprx2p is a duplicate of tprx <dig> 

∘ argfx, dprx and tprx gene families. there are no known invertebrate members of these three gene families. therefore, these are exceptions to the rule defining gene families as dating to the base of the bilateria. the dprx and tprx gene families may have arisen by duplication and very extensive divergence from crx, a member of the otx gene family, during mammalian evolution; origins of argfx are obscure  <cit> .

∘ dux gene family. members of this gene family are characterized by the presence of two closely-linked homeobox motifs. most members are intronless sequences present in multiple polymorphic copies within the  <dig>  kb family of tandemly repeated elements associated with heterochromatin. these comprise the sequences known as dux <dig> to dux <dig> reported in previous studies  <cit>  and numerous dux <dig> copies detected in this study . the absence of introns suggests that these sequences may have originated by retrotransposition from an mrna transcript, thus they are probably non-functional. there are two noticeable exceptions; these members known as duxa and duxb possess introns, thus either one could be the progenitor for the large number of intronless dux-family sequences found in the human genome. duxa has spawned  <dig> retrotransposed pseudogenes and has been described previously  <cit> . duxb is described here .

∘ hopx gene family. phylogenetic analyses places this gene family, containing a single very divergent homeobox gene hopx , either within the prd class  or close to zhx/homez-family genes . we favor placement in the prd class for three reasons. first, the hopx homeodomain has highest sequence identity with prd-class homeodomains . second, the hopx homeodomain possesses the same combination of residues that are invariably conserved across human prd-class homeodomains . third, the hopx homeodomain shares the 46/ <dig> intron position seen in many prd-class homeodomains. hopx does not map particularly near any other homeobox genes, although the closest is gsx <dig> in the antp class at 4q <dig> . hopx is not a typical prd-class homeobox gene; the homeodomain has a single amino acid insertion between helix i and helix ii , and lacks the ability to bind dna  <cit> .

∘ leutx gene family. this gene family contains a single gene in the human genome, leutx, and no known invertebrate members. we place leutx in the prd class for four reasons. first, there is weak phylogenetic support for this placement . second, the leutx homeodomain possesses the same combination of residues that are invariably conserved across human prd-class homeodomains . third, the leutx homeodomain shares the 46/ <dig> intron position seen in many prd-class homeodomains. fourth, the leutx gene is located close to the prd-class genes tprx <dig>  crx, dprx and duxa on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> . this fourth observation leads us to hypothesize that this gene family arose by tandem duplication and extensive divergence during mammalian evolution.

∘ nobox gene family. this gene family falls close to the division between the antp and prd classes in both maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining phylogenetic analyses . we favor placement within the prd class because the nobox homeodomain has higher sequence identity with prd-class homeodomains  than with antp-class homeodomains . chromosomal position does not shed light on the issue, as its location at 7q <dig> is close to both antp- and prd-class genes .

∘ otx gene family. this very well known gene family was originally considered to contain human otx <dig> and otx <dig>  and the drosophila otd gene  <cit> . later, it was shown that the crx gene is a member of the same gene family, deriving from the same ancestral gene. thus, crx could be considered the true otx <dig> gene  <cit> . unfortunately, the otx <dig> symbol was formerly used erroneously for a gene in a different family, now called dmbx <dig>  thus complicating its future use. the gene family name otx is derived by majority rule from the constituent genes.

∘ pax2/5/ <dig> gene family. this gene family is also known as pax group ii; it contains pax <dig>  pax <dig> and pax <dig>  clearly derived from a single ancestral gene  <cit> . these genes have partial homeoboxes.

∘ pax3/ <dig> gene family. this gene family is also known as pax group iii; it contains pax <dig> and pax <dig>  clearly derived from a single ancestral gene  <cit> .

∘ pax4/ <dig> gene family. this gene family is also known as pax group iv; it contains pax <dig> and pax <dig>  there is confusion as to whether this should be split into two gene families, because invertebrate homologs generally group with pax <dig> in phylogenetic analyses and not as an outgroup to the two genes as might be expected. we follow the generally accepted view and group pax <dig> and pax <dig> into a single gene family, proposing that pax <dig> is a divergent member, not an ancient gene  <cit> .

∘ rhox gene family. the mouse rhox cluster was first described as comprising twelve x-linked homeobox genes, all selectively expressed in reproductive tissues  <cit> . subsequent studies reported a total of  <dig> genes in the cluster, with the additional genes attributed to recent tandem duplications  <cit> . the human genome contains three homeobox genes at xq <dig> that are clearly members of the rhox gene family based on sequence identity, molecular phylogenetics, intron positions and chromosomal location. these are rhoxf <dig> , rhoxf <dig>  and rhoxf2b .

most of the  <dig> genes in the prd class have been adequately named previously. however, several genes were unnamed or misnamed prior to this study. we have updated these as follows.

∘ alx <dig>  is the first of three human members of the alx gene family. this gene was previously known as cart1; we rename it alx <dig> because it is related to alx <dig> and alx4; all three genes were formed by duplication from a single ancestral invertebrate gene  <cit> .

∘ drgx  is the only member of the newly defined drgx gene family in the human genome. this gene was previously known as prrxl <dig> and drg <dig>  and there is a clear mouse ortholog . the symbol prrxl <dig> is misleading because it infers membership of the prrx gene family, containing prrx <dig> and prrx <dig> in the human genome. several lines of evidence suggest it belongs to a different gene family. first, this gene  is not located in the same paralogon as prrx <dig>  and prrx <dig>  so they are not three paralogs generated during genome duplication in early vertebrate evolution. second, it has a completely different exon-intron structure from the prrx-family genes, and it does not contain a prrx domain or an oar domain . third, the homeodomain is only 73% identical to prrx <dig> and prrx <dig> homeodomains, much lower than the 80-100% usually encountered for members of the same gene family in humans. finally, we have identified the drosophila ortholog, ip <dig>  the homeodomains of drosophila ip <dig> and human drgx form a highly supported monophyletic group in our maximum likelihood  and neighbor-joining  phylogenetic analyses. the new symbol drgx  incorporates the root of the former symbol drg <dig>  referring to expression of the rodent ortholog in dorsal root ganglia neurons  <cit> .

∘ duxb  is a human member of the dux  gene family. as previously discussed, most members of this gene family are intronless and are probably derived by retrotransposition of an mrna transcript from a functional intron-containing dux gene . booth and holland  <cit>  described the duxa gene containing five introns , and noted the existence of a second intron-containing human dux-family gene provisionally designated duxb. the duxb nomenclature is endorsed here. no cdna or est sequences have been reported for duxb.

∘ gsc <dig>  is the second of two human members of the gsc gene family. this gene was previously known as gscl; we rename it gsc <dig> to remove the inadvertent implication that it is not a true gene, and also to reflect the clear orthology to chick gsc <dig> as inferred by phylogenetic analysis and synteny.

∘ hopx  is the only member of the newly defined hopx gene family in the human genome. the mouse version of the gene was first identified first and named hop  because the encoded protein is just  <dig> amino acids long, with  <dig> of these making up the homeodomain  <cit> . the hop gene symbol is not ideal as it is also used for unrelated genes, including hopscotch in drosophila and hop-sterile in mouse. therefore, we revise the gene symbol from hop to hopx  in accordance with homeobox gene nomenclature convention.

∘ leutx  is the only member of the newly defined leutx gene family in the human genome. we designate this previously unnamed gene leutx  to reflect the presence of a leucine residue at the otherwise highly conserved homeodomain position 20; other prd-class homeodomains have a phenylalanine at this position . studies of mutations in other homeobox genes suggest that mutation to leucine alters transcriptional activity of a homeodomain protein  <cit> .

∘ rax <dig>  is the second of two human members of the rax gene family. this gene was previously known as raxl1; we rename it rax <dig> to standardize nomenclature.

∘ rhoxf <dig>  and rhoxf <dig>  are two of three human members of the rhox gene family. these genes were previously known as otex/pepp <dig> and pepp <dig> respectively. the prefix pepp is not suitable as it is used for numerous aminopeptidase p-encoding genes. thus, we replace the gene symbols otex/pepp <dig> and pepp <dig> with rhoxf <dig> and rhoxf <dig> respectively, to reflect their orthologous relationship with the mouse rhox cluster  whilst avoiding inadvertent equivalence to specific genes within the cluster.

∘ rhoxf2b  is the third human member of the rhox gene family. this locus was referred to in previous studies as pepp2b  <cit>  and pepp <dig>  <cit> . the prefix pepp cannot be approved for reasons noted above. rhoxf2b is located very close to rhoxf <dig> and rhoxf <dig> at xq <dig> and is clearly a very recent duplicate of rhoxf <dig>  the genomic sequences at these two loci share 99% identity over exonic, intronic and approximately  <dig> kb flanking regions. over the coding region, there are just two nucleotide substitutions ; one of these results in an unusual change within the homeodomain . we currently list rhoxf2b as a functional gene, although it is possible that it is a duplicated pseudogene.

∘ sebox  is the only member of the sebox gene family in the human genome. the human gene is the ortholog of mouse sebox based on their locations in syntenic chromosomal regions  and presence of the same intron positions. however, sequence identity is lower than normal for orthologous genes in mouse and human  and there is evidence that the human gene has undergone divergence. most surprisingly, the human sequence has two unusual substitutions in the homeodomain  <cit> . at homeodomain position  <dig>  the human sequence codes for lysine whereas mouse has asparagine; an earlier analysis of  <dig> homeodomain sequences found asparagine to be invariant at this position  <cit> . similarly, at homeodomain position  <dig>  human has tryptophan whereas mouse has arginine; this position is almost invariably arginine  <cit> . these sequence changes in the important third helix raise the possibility that human sebox could have accumulated mutations as a non-functional pseudogene. until this is shown more clearly we consider it to be a functional, but divergent, gene. this gene was previously known as og9x with sebox as the alternative symbol; we favor sebox because the og prefix was originally used for several unrelated homeobox genes.

∘ uncx  is the only member of the uncx gene family in the human genome. this gene was previously known as uncx <dig> ; we remove the numerals to give uncx as these do not denote a series within a gene family.

∘ vsx <dig>  is the second of two human members of the vsx gene family. this gene was previously known as chx10; we rename it vsx <dig> to better reflect its paralogous relationship to vsx <dig>  vsx <dig> has been used as an alias for this gene in other vertebrate species and the gene symbol chx <dig> has the disadvantage of implicitly suggesting presence of at least nine paralogs in human , which do not exist.

unlike the situation with the antp class, many of the pseudogenes within the prd class have been well characterized. a previous study has described and named two pseudogenes in the argfx gene family, seven pseudogenes in the dprx gene family, four pseudogenes in the tprx gene family, and  <dig> pseudogenes derived from the duxa gene  <cit> . there is also a possibility that the sebox and rhoxf2b loci are non-functional pseudogenes, as described above. we have identified a previously undescribed pseudogene from the otx gene family , and argue that the majority of dux-family sequences are pseudogenes.

∘ otx2p <dig> . we designate this previously undescribed sequence otx2p <dig> because it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of otx <dig>  the genomic dna sequence of otx2p <dig> shares significant homology with otx <dig> transcript variant  <dig> . there is an alu element  insertion, a made <dig>  insertion, and a 1182-nucleotide deletion in otx2p <dig> compared to otx <dig>  the otx2p <dig> sequence lacks introns, ends with a poly tail, and harbors critical sequence alterations .

∘ dux <dig> , dux <dig> , dux <dig>  and dux <dig> . these sequences have been cloned in previous studies  <cit> . we detected no matches with 100% identity to dux <dig>  dux <dig>  dux <dig> or dux <dig> in build  <dig>  of the human genome sequence, which covers the euchromatic regions of each chromosome. this concurs with previous studies indicating that dux <dig>  dux <dig>  dux <dig> and dux <dig> are found in heterochromatin on human acrocentric chromosomes; each is apparently present in multiple copies within members of the  <dig>  kb family of tandemly repeated dna elements  <cit> . because the majority of human heterochromatin has not been sequenced, and may be variable between individuals, the exact number of copies of dux <dig>  dux <dig>  dux <dig> and dux <dig> is unknown. it is also debatable whether these loci encode functional proteins. these sequences lack introns and, as discussed above, are most likely derived from intron-containing genes in the dux family, such as duxa or duxb.

∘ dux <dig> . this sequence has been extensively studied as some of its multiple copies exist within the  <dig>  kb repetitive elements of the d4z <dig> locus at 4q <dig>  <cit> . the polymorphic d4z <dig> locus is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ; between  <dig> and  <dig> tandem copies of  <dig>  kb elements are present in unaffected individuals and deletions leaving a maximum of eight such elements have been associated with fshd  <cit> . in build  <dig>  of the human genome sequence, we identified  <dig> loci at  <dig> chromosomal locations containing a total of  <dig> dux <dig>  homeobox sequences. this should not be taken as a precise figure due to copy number polymorphism and the possibility of additional copies existing in currently unsequenced heterochromatic regions. some of the copies are 100% identical to the previously reported dux <dig> sequence over the homeobox regions, others have single nucleotide polymorphisms, some have critical sequence mutations, and others have just a single homeobox. most of the copies are located in tandemly repeated arrays  and others are alone in the genome . the majority of dux <dig> copies are unlikely to encode functional proteins as suggested by their intronless, mutated and tandemly repeated nature. the lack of introns indicates they are most likely derived from intron-containing genes in the dux family, such as duxa or duxb.

the lim homeobox class
the lim class encodes proteins with two lim domains  n-terminal to a typical  homeodomain. the lim domain is a protein-protein interaction domain of approximately  <dig> amino acids comprising two specialised cysteine-rich zinc fingers in tandem  <cit> . importantly, human genes also exist that encode lim domains but not homeodomains. these lim domains are divergent from the lim domains encoded by lim homeobox genes, and hence these genes are unlikely to be derived by loss of the homeobox. there is one exception: the human lmo gene family encodes lim domains that have been grouped by sequence similarity and domain arrangement with the lim domains of the lim homeobox gene class  <cit> . thus, this gene family may have secondarily lost the homeobox, although this remains untested. only genes encoding both lim domains and homeodomains are included in our lim homeobox gene count.

we have identified a total of twelve lim-class homeobox genes in the human genome , consistent with previous work  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains do not always recover the lim class as a monophyletic group, depending on the dataset and method used , but it is likely that the class evolved from a single fusion event that brought together lim domains and a homeodomain. phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains divide the lim class into six gene families , consistent with previous studies  <cit> . each gene family has two human members and dates to a single ancestral gene in the most recent common ancestor of bilaterians  <cit> . we have not found any human lim-class pseudogenes.

human homeobox genes and pseudogenes, excepting the antp and prd classes, including full names, chromosomal locations, entrez gene ids and previous symbols. the homez gene is in the zf class but encodes a protein with leucine zippers instead of zinc fingers.

the pou homeobox class
the pou class generally encodes proteins with a pou-specific domain , oct <dig> and oct <dig> , andnematode unc-86) n-terminal to a typical homeodomain. the pou-specific domain is a dna-binding domain of approximately  <dig> amino acids; the pou-specific domain and the homeodomain are collectively known as the bipartite pou domain  <cit> .

we have identified a total of  <dig> pou-class homeobox genes in the human genome . the genes form a distinct grouping even if the pou-specific domain is disregarded – phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains recover the pou class as a monophyletic group . there are six widely recognized gene families within the pou class , and nomenclature revisions approximately  <dig> years ago clarified which genes belong to which gene family  <cit> . we have placed two additional genes  in the pou class on the basis of their deduced homeodomain sequences, even though one of these genes  does not encode a pou-specific domain. we have erected a new gene family for this gene, bringing the total number of gene families in the pou class to seven. we have also identified a total of eight pou-class pseudogenes in the human genome ; we have named six of these , and revised the nomenclature of one other .

∘ hdx . this gene was previously known as cxorf <dig>  the gene encodes a highly divergent atypical  homeodomain but not a pou-specific domain, and thus it is debatable whether it should be placed within the pou class. phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains place it basally in a clade with the pou class , or within the pou class , suggesting that the hdx protein either diverged before the pou-specific domain became associated with the homeodomain or lost the pou-specific domain during evolution. further information on this gene may allow this tentative classification to be revisited.

∘ pou5f <dig> . we designate this previously unnamed gene pou5f <dig> on the basis of clear orthology to the mouse sprm <dig> gene, which has been assigned the second member of the pou <dig> gene family  <cit> . the symbol pou5f <dig> ensures the gene conforms with standardized nomenclature for the pou class.

∘ pou5f1p <dig> , pou5f1p <dig>  , pou5f1p <dig> , pou5f1p <dig> , pou5f1p <dig> , pou5f1p <dig>  and pou5f1p <dig> . prior to this study, a single retrotransposed pseudogene of the pou5f <dig> gene had been annotated and designated pou5f1p <dig> . another pou5f1-related sequence of unknown status had been annotated and designated pouf5f1l . we replace the gene symbol pouf5f1l with pou5f1p <dig> as this sequence is a retrotransposed pseudogene of pouf <dig>  our analyses of the human genome sequence identified a further six pseudogenes of pou5f <dig>  which we name sequentially pou5f1p <dig>  pou5f1p <dig> through to pou5f1p <dig>  each clearly aligns to the mrna sequence of pou5f <dig> but with sequence alterations, indicating origin by retrotransposition. pou5f1p <dig> and pou5f1p <dig> have frameshift mutations in the homeobox. pou5f1p <dig> and pou5f1p <dig> have stop codons in the homeobox. pou5f1p <dig> and pou5f1p <dig> are partial integrants of pou5f <dig> mrna excluding the homeobox – pou5f1p <dig> covers part of the 3' untranslated region and pou5f1p <dig> a short region around the start codon.

the hnf homeobox class
the hnf class  encodes proteins with a pou-like domain n-terminal to a highly atypical homeodomain. the pou-like domain, as its name indicates, is weakly similar in sequence to the pou-specific domain  <cit> ; more importantly, it has nearly the same three-dimensional structure and mode of dna binding as the pou-specific domain  <cit> .

we have identified a total of three hnf-class homeobox genes in the human genome , consistent with previous work  <cit> . the homeodomains encoded by the human hnf1a and hnf1b genes are atypical in possessing  <dig> extra amino acid residues between the second and third alpha helices . we place these two genes in a single gene family  within the hnf class, implying derivation from a single invertebrate gene. examination of their chromosomal locations concurs with this view. hnf1a and hnf1b map to parts of the genome known to have duplicated in early vertebrate evolution, namely 12q <dig>   and 17q <dig>  . the use of the a and b suffixes is unfortunate, as numerals are generally used to distinguish paralogs of this age, but is retained at present due to widespread and stable use. the homeodomain encoded by the human hmbox <dig> gene is atypical in possessing  <dig> extra amino acid residues between the second and third alpha helices . phylogenetic analyses confirm previous suggestions  <cit>  that hmbox <dig> is more distantly related to hnf1a and hnf1b . we place this gene in a separate gene family  within the same class. we have not found any human hnf-class pseudogenes.

the sine homeobox class
the sine class  encodes proteins with a six domain n-terminal to a typical homeodomain. the six domain is a dna-binding domain of approximately  <dig> amino acids; both the six domain and the homeodomain are required for dna binding  <cit> .

we have identified a total of six sine-class homeobox genes in the human genome , consistent with previous work  <cit> . the genes form a distinct grouping even if the six domain is disregarded – phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains recover the six class as a monophyletic group . phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains divide the six class into three gene families , consistent with previous studies  <cit> . each gene family has two human members and dates to a single ancestral gene in the most recent common ancestor of bilaterians  <cit> . we have not found any human sine-class pseudogenes.

the tale homeobox class
tale  class genes are distinguished by the presence of three extra amino acids between the first and second alpha helices of the encoded homeodomain  <cit> . genes belonging to the tale class encode proteins with various domains outside of the atypical homeodomain.

we have identified a total of  <dig> tale-class homeobox genes in the human genome . the genes form a distinct grouping in phylogenetic analyses even when the three extra homeodomain residues are excluded from the sequence alignment . bürglin  <cit>  has given the tale group the rank of 'superclass' and distinguished between several 'classes' by the presence of distinct domains outside of the homeodomain. these are the irx domain, mkx domains, the meis domain, the pbc domain and tgif domains  <cit> . along with some others  <cit> , we have given the tale group the rank of 'class' containing several 'gene families'; this maintains consistent terminology throughout the present paper. phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains divide the tale class into six gene families , including an mkx family containing the recently described mkx gene, which is distinguished from irx-family genes phylogenetically and by absence of an irx domain  <cit> . it should be noted that the established name of the pknox gene family does not indicate orthology with knox-family genes of plants. we have also identified a total of  <dig> tale-class pseudogenes in the human genome ; we have named six of these , and revised the nomenclature of two others .

∘ irx1p <dig> . this sequence was previously known as irxa1; we rename it irx1p <dig> because it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of irx <dig> and not a functional gene. the irx1p <dig> sequence aligns to the mrna of irx <dig> but has a frameshift mutation and two stop codons in the homeobox.

∘ irx4p <dig> . we designate this previously unannotated sequence irx4p <dig> because it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of irx <dig>  the irx4p <dig> sequence is a partial integrant derived from a region of the irx <dig> mrna around the stop codon; it lacks the homeobox.

∘ pbx2p <dig> . this sequence was previously known as pbxp1; we rename it pbx2p <dig> because it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of pbx <dig>  the former name of pbxp <dig> did not indicate its transcript of origin. the pbx2p <dig> sequence aligns to the mrna of pbx <dig> but has a frameshift mutation in the coding region.

∘ tgif1p <dig> . we designate this previously unannotated sequence tgif1p <dig> because it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of tgif <dig>  the locus has many sequence alterations when compared to tgif <dig> mrna, including a  <dig> nucleotide insertion within the homeobox.

∘ tgif2p <dig> , tgif2p <dig> , tgif2p <dig>  and tgif2p <dig> . these four sequences were unannotated prior to this study. we designate them tgif2p <dig> to tgif2p <dig> because they are clearly pseudogenes of tgif <dig>  each aligns to the mrna sequence of tgif <dig> but with sequence alterations, indicating origin by retrotransposition. tgif2p <dig> has many sequence alterations, including a frameshift mutation in the homeobox. tgif2p <dig> and tgif2p <dig> are very similar neighboring loci that must have originated by tandem duplication of a retrotransposed tgif <dig> mrna; neither includes the homeobox. tgif2p <dig> is a short partial integrant derived from part of the 3' untranslated region of tgif <dig> mrna.

the cut homeobox class
the cut class  generally encodes proteins with one or more cut domains n-terminal to a typical homeodomain. the cut domain is a dna-binding domain of approximately  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . there are three widely recognized gene families within the cut class in humans . a fourth gene family , lacking a cut domain but sharing a cmp domain with the satb gene family, is absent from vertebrates. bürglin and cassata  <cit>  have proposed that the vertebrate satb gene family evolved from the invertebrate cmp gene family.

we have identified a total of seven cut-class homeobox genes in the human genome . although grouped together by presence of cut domains, the homeodomains of the onecut, cux and satb gene families are quite divergent and do not always form a monophyletic group in phylogenetic analyses . topologies that separate the gene families are also only weakly supported, so it is most parsimonious to assume that the class is actually monophyletic but the constituent genes underwent rapid sequence divergence following their initial duplications. we have revised the nomenclature of two cut-class genes . we have also identified a total of three cut-class pseudogenes in the human genome ; we have named all of these .

∘ cux <dig>  and cux <dig> . these genes were previously known as cutl <dig> and cutl <dig> respectively. we rename them cux <dig> and cux <dig> in accordance with homeobox gene nomenclature convention.

∘ cux2p <dig> and cux2p <dig>  these sequences were unannotated prior to this study. we designate them cux2p <dig> and cux2p <dig> because they are clearly retrotransposed pseudogenes of cux <dig>  both are short partial integrants derived from cux <dig> mrna, excluding the homeobox – cux2p <dig> covers part of the coding region at the 5' end and cux2p <dig> part of the 3' untranslated region.

∘ satb1p <dig> . we designate this previously unannotated sequence satb1p <dig> because it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of satb <dig>  satb1p <dig> is a short partial integrant derived from part of the 3' untranslated region of satb <dig> mrna; it does not encompass the homeobox.

the pros homeobox class
the pros class  encodes proteins with a pros domain c-terminal to an atypical homeodomain. the pros domain is a dna-binding domain of approximately  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . pros-class genes encode a highly divergent homeodomain with three extra amino acids. these additional residues are inserted at a different position compared to the tale class, being between the second and third alpha helices .

we have identified a total of two pros-class homeobox genes in the human genome , which we have placed in a single gene family . the highly divergent homeodomain sequence and unusual structural features provide justification for pros being a separate gene class, despite the small number of genes. in phylogenetic analyses, pros-class homeodomains are situated on a long branch, very distant from other classes . the human prox <dig> gene is well characterized; we have identified and named its paralog, prox <dig>  we have not found any human pros-class pseudogenes.

∘ prox <dig> . we designate this previously unannotated gene prox <dig> on the basis of clear orthology to the mouse prox <dig> gene, inferred from sequence identity and synteny. the homeobox of human prox <dig> has two introns and unusually the splice sites of the first  intron  do not follow the gt-ag donor-acceptor rule. this has also been noted for mouse prox <dig>  <cit> .

the zf homeobox class
the zf  class generally encodes proteins with zinc finger motifs, in addition to one or more homeodomains. as noted earlier, phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains does not recover the zf class as a monophyletic group . we recognize that this suggests that zinc finger motifs and homeodomains may have been brought together on three separate occasions in evolution; nonetheless, it is convenient and informative to group these into a single class. inclusion of the homez gene in the zf class may be surprising, as this gene does not encode zinc fingers. however, as previously noted  <cit>  and reproduced in our phylogenetic analyses , the multiple homeodomain sequences of this gene are clearly related to those encoded by the zhx <dig>  zhx <dig> and zhx <dig> genes.

we have identified a total of  <dig> zf-class homeobox genes in the human genome , which we have placed in five gene families . we have also identified one zf-class pseudogenes in the human genome . we have revised the nomenclature of five of these loci .

∘ adnp <dig> . this gene was previously known as znf508; we rename it adnp <dig> to reflect its paralogous relationship to adnp.

∘ zeb <dig>  and zeb <dig> . these genes were previously known as zfhx1a and zfhx1b respectively. we rename them zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> to distinguish them from genes belonging to the distantly related zfhx gene family.

∘ zeb2p <dig> . this retrotransposed pseudogene of zeb <dig> has been described previously  <cit> . our new nomenclature  reflects the origin of this locus.

∘ zfhx <dig> . this gene was previously known as atbf1; we rename it zfhx <dig> to reflect its close relationship to zfhx <dig> and zfhx4; indeed zfhx <dig> was a synonym for this gene.

the cers homeobox class
the highly unusual cers  class, also known as the lass  class, comprises a single gene family that is highly conserved amongst eukaryotes and includes the yeast gene and original member lag <dig>  there are six cers-class genes in the human genome  and five of these  encode proteins with a homeodomain sequence  <cit> . these are, however, extremely divergent from the homeodomains of other gene classes. secondary structure prediction analyses suggest these sequences have the potential to encode three alpha helices in the appropriate positions . the most surprising characteristic of these genes is that biochemical studies predict them to encode transmembrane proteins, with the homeodomain on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and hence they could not act as dna-binding proteins or transcription factors  <cit> . it is possible that an ancestor of these genes gained a homeobox through exon shuffling, or alternatively this could represent convergent evolution. we include only cers <dig> to cers <dig> in our comprehensive compilation of human homeobox genes, as cers <dig> lacks a homeobox motif.

chromosomal distribution of human homeobox genes
the chromosomal locations of genes can give clues to evolutionary ancestry, including patterns of gene duplication, and the possible existence of gene clusters. in figure  <dig>  we show the chromosomal locations of all human homeobox genes. we do not include probable pseudogenes on these ideograms, because most of these have originated by reverse transcription of mrna and secondary integration into the genome, and hence give no insight into ancestral locations of genes. the highly repetitive dux <dig> to dux <dig> sequences are also not shown, as these have undergone secondary amplification and are also most likely non-functional .

the first observation is that there are homeobox genes on every human chromosome. even the two sex chromosomes harbor homeobox genes, with shox  in the par <dig> pseudoautosomal region at the tip of the short arms of x and y being the best known. haploinsufficiency of shox is implicated in the short stature phenotype of turner syndrome patients who lack one copy of the x chromosome  <cit> . there are also nine other homeobox genes in non-pseudoautosomal regions of the x chromosome, including three tandemly-arranged members of the rhox gene family, collectively homologous to the multiple rhox  genes of mouse. only one of the homeobox genes on the x chromosome, the tale-class gene tgif2lx, has a distinct homolog on the y chromosome, called tgif2ly. these genes map to the largest homology block shared by the unique regions of the x and y chromosomes, spanning  <dig>  mb. it has been proposed that the ancestor of these two genes arose by retrotransposition of tgif <dig> mrna  <cit> .

the autosomes with the lowest number of homeobox genes are chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . examination of the remaining autosomes reveals that homeobox genes are quite dispersed with some interesting regional accumulations. the best known examples of close linkage between homeobox genes are the four hox clusters on human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  comprising  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively; each of these is shown as just a single line on each ideogram for simplicity . these should not be considered in isolation, however, because many other antp-class genes map in the vicinity of the hox clusters  <cit> . these include genes very tightly linked to the hox clusters, notably the evx-family genes , dlx-family genes , and meox-family genes .

there are other concentrations of antp-class genes away from the hox clusters. these are the parahox cluster  on chromosome  <dig>  and four sets of nkl-subclass genes on 2p/8p , 4p, 5q and 10q, hypothesized to be derived from an ancestral array by duplication  <cit> . the accumulation on the distal half of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> is particularly striking, comprising eleven antp-class genes from  <dig> gene families. this is not a tight gene cluster, but it is compatible with ancestry by extensive tandem gene duplication followed by dispersal. discounting the rather aberrant case of the hox clusters, this region of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> is the most homeobox-rich region of the human genome.

there are additional groupings of homeobox genes outside the antp class. these include two tale-class irx clusters on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> homologous to the described mouse irx clusters  <cit> , and a set of prd-class genes on chromosome  <dig> proposed to be derived from the crx homeobox gene by duplication and rapid divergence  <cit> . perhaps the most interesting case, however, is found on the tip of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  where there is a concentration of homeobox genes from disparate gene classes. four lim-class genes, one antp-class gene, one prd-class gene and one tale-class gene are found in this location. although dispersed over a large region, and not forming a tight gene cluster, the linkages are nonetheless intriguing. it is possible that these linkages reflect ancestry from the very ancient gene duplications that must have generated the distinctive homeobox gene classes found within animal genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> homeobox loci in the euchromatic regions of the human genome, and divide these into  <dig> probable functional genes and  <dig> probable pseudogenes. not all of these loci possess a homeobox because for completeness we include all sequences derived from homeobox-containing genes. the number of homeobox sequences is also different from the number of loci because several genes contain multiple homeobox motifs. the figures exclude the repetitive dux <dig> to dux <dig> homeobox sequences of which we identified  <dig> probable pseudogenes, with many more expected in heterochromatic regions.

new or revised nomenclature is proposed for approximately  <dig> of the  <dig> homeobox loci in order to clarify orthologous relationships between human and mouse, to indicate evolutionary relationships within a gene family, to distinguish genes from pseudogenes, and to indicate pseudogene origins. the loci are also classified into a simple hierarchical scheme, comprising  <dig> gene families within eleven gene classes. the classification scheme proposed may be widely applicable to homeobox genes from other animals.

the  <dig> probable functional homeobox genes map to every human chromosome with some interesting regional concentrations of genes. these include a large number of antp-class genes on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  and a combination of lim-, antp-, prd- and tale-class genes on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  these associations may be remnants of common ancestry early in animal evolution.
