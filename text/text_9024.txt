BACKGROUND
the bear family  is one of the most studied families within the order carnivora. members of this family are present on most continents and occupy a wide range of ecological niches from the arctic ice shelves to tropical rainforests . despite numerous morphological and molecular studies on the phylogenetic relationship among ursidae members, no consensus exists with regard to either their phylogeny or their taxonomic nomenclature . most analyses have concentrated on the eight extant bear species: brown bear, american black bear, asian black bear, polar bear, sun bear, sloth bear, spectacled bear and giant panda . molecular studies based on mitochondrial and nuclear dna from modern bears have recently provided convincing evidence about several of the controversial relationships among the bears, such as the basal positions of the giant panda and the spectacled bear in the bear tree  <cit>  and the position of the polar bear within the brown bear tree making the later paraphyletic  <cit> . however, molecular studies for a long time failed to conclusively resolve the phylogenetic relationships among the members of the bear subfamily ursinae  <cit> , which includes all living bear species except the giant panda and the spectacled bear, from here on referred to as ursine bears. the phylogenetic uncertainty has resulted in major taxonomic confusion. based on both morphological and molecular data up to six different genera  have been suggested for the extant ursine bears .

recently, a study on mitochondrial genome sequences  of all extant bears presented for the first time an almost completely resolved bear phylogeny with support for most of the problematic nodes in the bear family tree, except for the position of the sloth bear  <cit> . this shows that longer sequences are necessary for reconstructing a robust phylogeny  <cit> . such large data sets also facilitate the molecular dating of divergence events within a phylogeny  <cit> . to resolve the relationships between the extant and extinct members of the bear family and to date the various divergence events among them, we used the complete mtdna  from ten different bear species. in addition to three published modern mtdnas  <cit> , we amplified and sequenced five modern bear mtdnas using a 2-step multiplex pcr approach  <cit> . we also amplified and sequenced entire mtdnas from the extinct european cave bear , believed to belong to the ursine bears  <cit> , and the extinct north american giant short-faced bear  , thought to be related to the spectacled bear  <cit> .

RESULTS
sequence retrieval
we retrieved complete mtdnas from genbank for three extant bear species: brown bear, american black bear and polar bear . for the remaining five living bear species, we sequenced the entire mtdna in overlapping fragments using a 2-step multiplex pcr approach  <cit>  and a mixture of direct sequencing and sequencing multiple clones . we also obtained the complete mtdna from the extinct european cave bear using a  <dig>  year old bone found in gamssulzen cave, austria. again, we used a 2-step multiplex approach, but in this case, all pcr products were cloned and multiple clones were sequenced . moreover, to ensure sequence accuracy, we determined each sequence position from at least two independent primary pcrs  <cit> . when we observed a discrepancy between the consensus sequences from each of the two amplifications we performed a third amplification and used the consensus sequence from all three amplifications . we used the same approach to sequence the extinct american giant short-faced bear mtdna, using a  <dig>  year-old calcaneum bone from eldorado creek, canada . in order to further ascertain that the results obtained are reproducible, samples of both extinct bears were extracted, amplified and sequenced each in an additional laboratory that did not have access to the results obtained in leipzig. for the cave bear a total of  <dig>  bp were independently reproduced in cambridge and for the american giant short-faced bear a total of  <dig> bp was replicated in the australian centre for ancient dna in adelaide. the consensus sequences for all fragments determined in cambridge were identical to those determined in leipzig. the replicated fragments at the australian centre for ancient dna were identical to the sequence obtained in leipzig except for a single deletion close to the 5'-end of the light strand in the first fragment. the sequence for this fragment was obtained by direct sequencing in just one 5' to 3' direction on the light strand. given that sequence accuracy immediately downstream the sequencing primer is low, it is likely that this deletion represents a sequencing artifact.

phylogenetic analyses
all ten bear mtdnas were aligned using the harbor seal  mtdna as outgroup. phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference. we recovered the same topology using all above-mentioned optimality criteria . our results confirm the giant panda's basal position in the bear phylogeny  <cit>  and also place the spectacled bear outside ursine bears. in contrast to previous studies our data was sufficient to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among ursine bears with statistical support for all nodes. the sloth bear falls basal to all other ursine bears, which form a monophyletic group with 85%, 93%, and 100% support , respectively). the hypothesis suggesting that the sloth bear is basal to the sun bear and black bear clade  did not have a significantly worse likelihood  than the topology favored by our data  although it had a slightly higher homoplasy index and a less parsimonious tree . in a mp analysis, however, this hypothesis  received significantly less support . thus, we suggest that ursine bears are separated into two sister clades, comprised of three species each with the sloth bear forming the basal branch. the first clade contains cave, brown, and polar bears and is supported by all methods. the second clade is composed of the sun and black bears  and receives varying support values, depending on the tree reconstruction method . finally, the placement of the extinct american giant short-faced bear as a sister taxon to the spectacled bear is supported in all analyses .

unpartitioned and partitioned phylogenetic analyses in maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference of phylogeny. in partitioned analyses every partition was allowed to evolve under a separate unlinked gtr+Γ substitution model and distinct base frequencies in ml and bayesian inference of phylogeny.

the phylogenetic reconstruction makes evident a difficulty in resolving the relationships within ursine bears. as a matter of fact, most of the internal branches are very short. this observation  makes it likely that individual genes  may exhibit different tree topologies, as shown for humans, chimpanzees and gorillas  <cit> . in our case, we notice that individual loci of the mtdna support different topologies. genes such as 12s rrna, nd4l, nd <dig>  and nd <dig> exhibited phylogenetic incongruence with two to four other mitochondrial genes . the highest amount of phylogenetic conflict emerged from partitioning the mtdna to individual genes and the trnas of the two strands , but only two nodes showed evidence of hidden conflict in a mp setting . emerging support was evident for all terminal nodes including the ursine branching point . intra-ursine nodes t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> were the only nodes to show <100% replicate-based support values, a fact that may be owed to the lack of consistent support provided by those genes .

estimation of divergence times
we used several fossil calibration points to estimate the mtdna divergence dates within the bears . the posterior mean of the divergence time between bears and the harbor seal was estimated at  <dig> million years ago , which agrees with previous estimates based on both molecular and paleontological data  <cit> . however, due to the wide uniform priors we used for the calibration points, the confidence interval  remains large, depending on the type of analysis. the initial divergence within bears occurred between the giant panda and all remaining bears, estimated to have happened between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma . the next divergence was that of the new world spectacled bear group, which separated from the main ursine bear lineage about  <dig>  to  <dig>  ma. the posterior mean divergence of the two new world species, the extant spectacled and the extinct american giant short-faced bear, was estimated to have happened between  <dig>  and  <dig> ma. within the remaining ursine bears, the estimated divergence times all show overlapping confidence intervals, except for those within the brown bear clade.

the two mcmctree columns correspond to the unpartitioned and partitioned analyses. the divergence time estimates are in millions of years before present. hpd, highest posterior density; rate, evolutionary rate ; κ, transition-transversion parameter of the hky model; α, shape parameter of the rate heterogeneity Γ-distribution. af, see additional file  <dig> 

within the brown bear clade, we dated the divergence event between the cave and brown bear mtdna to  <dig> – <dig>  ma. the origin of the polar bear is more difficult to determine, as partial mtdna sequences suggest that polar bears actually fall within the genetic diversity spectrum of brown bears  <cit> , where they constitute a monophyletic clade closely related to a clade of brown bears from the abc islands in alaska. unfortunately, the published brown bear mtdna  <cit>  does not originate from this abc island clade, and therefore our estimated divergence for polar bears and brown bears is not a minimum date for this event, but rather the divergence date for different brown bear clades. as a consequence, the estimated divergence date of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma for brown and polar bears obtained in two recent studies  <cit>  using the same complete mtdnas should be interpreted with care. a mtdna from an abc island brown bear will be required to date the actual speciation event of polar bears more accurately.

we also examined whether more sequence data would improve our estimates on divergence times by plotting the posterior means of divergence times against the width of their corresponding 95% credibility interval , following yang and rannala  <cit> . we found significant correlations for both the unpartitioned and partitioned datasets . this linear relationship strongly suggests that longer sequences or more taxa than those examined here are unlikely to increase the precision of the divergence time estimates. therefore, in order to narrow the confidence intervals for the divergence date estimates within the bear phylogeny, more precisely dated fossil calibration points would be required.

the estimated substitution rate of approximately 10- <dig> substitutions/site/year was more similar to a mitogenomic dataset from primates than to the rate from extant and extinct proboscideans  <cit> . this evolutionary rate was also higher than that for parts of the nuclear irbp gene in bears .

discussion
our study represents the first comprehensive sampling of mtdnas for recent bears, including all living and two recently extinct bear species. the cave bear and the american giant short-faced bear are the third and fourth pleistocene species for which mtdnas have been determined. moreover, the cave bear genome is the first determined from a pleistocene sample obtained from a non-permafrost environment. compared to the extinct moas from which complete mtdnas have previously been determined from non-permafrost specimens  <cit> , the cave bear genome extends the time frame by an order of magnitude, showing that complete mtdna analysis can be performed using a wide range of samples. as is common in large scale ancient dna analyses  <cit> , we found a number of consistent differences between independent primary pcrs, all of which were either c to t or g to a substitutions . this confirms previous reports that deamination of cytosine is one of the most common, and probably the only type of miscoding lesion in ancient dna  <cit> . moreover, the high number of consistent substitutions  observed in the cave bear genome sequences shows that each sequence position needs to be replicated when performing such large scale analyses.

this analysis has allowed the phylogenetic topology of the bear family to be resolved with high support values. interestingly, it places the sloth bear basal to all other ursine bear species and the sun bear in a sister group related to the two black bear species. the latter observation coincides with paleontological information  <cit>  and previous mtdna studies  <cit> . an earlier study analysing six mtdna fragments, also placed the sloth bear basal to all other members of the ursine bears  <cit> . however, this study found weak support for the sun bear as being basal to the brown bear – polar bear clade rather than to the two black bear species.

the phylogenetic reconstruction also reveals the reasons for previous problems in resolving the relationships among ursine bears, as most of the internal branches for their phylogenetic tree are very short. such a short internal branch structure  makes it likely that individual nuclear genes  may exhibit different tree topologies, as shown for nuclear loci from humans, chimpanzees and gorillas  <cit> . furthermore it was previously shown that despite being a non-recombining single genetic locus, individual genes on the mtdna might produce different tree topologies  <cit> .

the mitogenomic data also has implications for bear taxonomy. six ursine bears and the sloth bear are monophyletic with absolute support, which agrees with hall and nowak's inclusion  of the asian black bear, american black bear, sun bear, polar bear and brown bear within the genus ursus  <cit>  and confirms the mitogenomic study by yu et al  <cit> . given the short divergence time of the six ursine bears and the sloth bear we suggest, following hall  <dig>  nowak  <dig> and yu et al  <dig>  <cit> , that the sloth bear is grouped together with the other ursine bears in the genus ursus and that the other genus names previously suggested for members of this radiation are discarded .

using this data set and multiple fossil calibration points, we have dated the various mtdna divergence events during bear evolution with reasonable confidence. strikingly, the divergence of the giant panda is estimated at about  <dig> ma . this estimate is much earlier than previously reported for the divergence of the panda lineage from the ursavus lineage based on teeth morphology of agriarctos fossils   <cit> . the latter divergence date has been used in several studies as a calibration point for dating bear radiations  <cit> . we decided not to use this date as a calibration point, since the oldest known panda fossil, ailuropoda microta, is less than  <dig>  million years old  <cit> , and therefore allows no inference about the date of divergence of this lineage. moreover, the fossil record for both ailuropoda and its potential ancestral species from the genus agriarctos is sparse, making an early miocene divergence date for the giant panda's lineage plausible. interestingly, the next divergence event is not until  <dig> ma  followed by a gap until  <dig> ma when a rapid radiation occurs. the american giant short-faced and spectacled bears diverged around  <dig>  ma, and the five ursine lineages diverged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma  .

thus, taking the confidence intervals for the molecular dating into account, seven lineages radiated between  <dig>  and  <dig> ma. such rapid radiations are also observed in other mammals, such as the cats  <cit>  and procyonids  <cit> , as well as in bird families like the woodpeckers  <cit> . strikingly, the major radiation wave for these families also occurred at the end of the miocene. in combination with the fossil record, the mtdna divergence estimates suggest that the rapid radiation of the bear family around the miocene-pliocene boundary followed a major extinction of some of the main bear genera such as ursavus, indarctos, agriotherium, and the hemicyoninae . similar species turnover events were also observed for other mammals over a limited time span near the miocene-pliocene boundary resulting in a massive extinction of more than 60–70% of all eurasian genera and 70–80% of north american genera  <cit> . the cause of this widespread species turnover during this time period remains unclear. some studies suggest that the initial opening of the bering strait at the beginning of the pliocene around  <dig>  ma caused a major separation of northern hemisphere habitats  <cit> . major climatic changes occurred during that time, such as the messinian crisis during which the mediterranean sea lost its connection to the world ocean system and became desiccated  <cit> . these changes resulted in forest cover decline and the spread of arid habitats in northern america and eurasia  <cit>  as well as a global increase in c <dig> biomass  <cit> . during that time, open grassland habitats, which were exploited by an entirely new suite of mammals  <cit> , replaced the earlier less seasonal woodland forest habitats. thus, it is possible that the environmental changes associated with the miocene-pliocene boundary and the following emergence of new ecological niches such as open grasslands caused an adaptive radiation in old and new world bears similar to a number of other species groups  <cit> . this could explain the divergence of the tremarctinae with the spectacled bear adapted to closed habitats and the american giant short-faced bears being predators dwelling in open habitats  <cit> . the latter adaptation was also described in other predator species that evolved around the miocene-pliocene boundary and were built for hunting in open habitats such as the cats  <cit> . other events such as the opening of the bering strait could have additionally promoted allopatric speciation in black bears. our divergence time estimates suggest that the american black bear could have spread to america before the bering strait opened around  <dig>  ma  <cit> . an early migration of ursine bears into the americas is also supported by the oldest known ursus fossil in north america, ursus abstrusus  <cit> , which was dated at  <dig>  ma, suggesting that u. abstrusus may be ancestral to the american black bear lineage.

obviously, the miocene-pliocene global changes had a major impact on the radiation of bears and other species, both between and within the old and new worlds. it is interesting to note that african apes experienced a similar species turnover at the end of the miocene, including the divergence of the chimpanzee and human lineages  <cit> . this latter event has been attributed to a magnified climatic variability starting at the end of the miocene  <cit> . more studies are necessary to address the relationships between global changes and species radiations at the beginning of the pliocene. our results strongly support the idea of a major wave of bear radiations during that time.

our data also indicate a much earlier divergence for the cave bear and brown bear lineages than those previously assumed, with a mean estimate at  <dig>  ma. this date agrees with recent results suggesting the existence of representatives of the brown bear lineage in europe as early as  <dig>  ma . nevertheless, it questions other studies suggesting a later divergence time for this species pair at around  <dig> – <dig>  ma based on the fossil record  <cit>  and molecular data  <cit> . loreille et al.  <cit> , however, used taberlet & bouvet's estimated divergence date for the two european brown bear lineages  of  <dig> ka  <cit> , which in turn was based on an application of vigilant et al.'s  <cit>  intraspecific human rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions/site/year – taberlet & bouvet cautioned that their estimates could be prone to uncertainty as they imported a human evolutionary rate. given recent reports of problems in estimated intraspecific divergence times based on interspecific calibrations and vice versa, the implicit use of indirectly extrapolated evolutionary rates is not recommended  <cit> .

most of the youngest fossils for ursus etruscus, the assumed ancestor of the cave and brown bear, have been dated to 2– <dig>  ma  <cit> , suggesting that a late divergence for the two lineages around  <dig>  ma is rather unlikely. these dates also partially overlap with the divergence date we obtained . a greater number of reliably dated fossils from early members of both the cave bear and brown bear lineages are necessary to date the divergence of u. spelaeus. however, around  <dig>  ma, the climate again changed dramatically with the onset of the first major cooling events and climatic oscillations at the end of the pliocene that eventually led to the pleistocene glaciations  <cit> . thus, if bear speciation events were influenced by climate change, cave bears and brown bears may indeed have separated as early as  <dig>  ma.

CONCLUSIONS
using complete mitochondrial genome sequences from both extinct and extant bears, we found evidence for a rapid radiation of bears at the miocene – pliocene boundary 5– <dig> million years ago within the old and new worlds. as rapid radiations were also observed in other species groups around this time  <cit> , we suggest that climate change played an important role during bear evolution and animal speciation in general.

our results clearly demonstrate the power of mitogenomic analyses for resolving complicated phylogenetic relationships among both extant and extinct species, using samples obtained not only from permafrost, but also from non-permafrost environments.
