BACKGROUND
a variety of vertebrate secretory cells with a basal activity become highly activated during their development or maturation, such as the immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells and the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells. induction of cells to become professional secretors involves massive changes at the level of gene transcription, protein biosynthesis and cellular ultrastructure. secretory organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, the golgi apparatus and the secretory granules become expanded and a variety of genes is upregulated, including those encoding the secretory cargo and the machinery involved in the transport and biosynthesis of the cargo . we use a unique neuroendocrine cell model, namely the xenopus laevis intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells, to study the events occurring during the activation of neuroendocrine cells to become professional secretory cells. the melanotropes are inducible neuroendocrine cells that play a central role in the process of background adaptation of the animal. when the frogs are on a white background , the melanotrope cells are only basally active. placing the animals on a black background  physiologically activates the melanotrope cells to become hyperactive professional secretory cells. hyperactive melanotropes are dedicated to produce and proteolytically process vast amounts of the prohormone proopiomelanocortin  and secrete the pomc-derived products . in xenopus melanotrope cells, pomc is synthesised as an n-glycosylated and sulphated  <dig> k prohormone  <cit>  that is subsequently cleaved to generate a number of bioactive peptides. the c-terminal portion of pomc is processed to α-melanophore-stimulating hormone , β-msh, corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide , β-endorphin and some linking regions of unknown function  <cit> . the n-terminal part of pomc , which bears the only n-glycan present in xenopus pomc, can be cleaved to two different γ-msh peptides, although the majority  is not processed to γ-msh but secreted as glycosylated  <dig> k or  <dig> k products  <cit> . mshs released into the blood cause darkening of the skin to allow the animal to adapt to its background.

when considering neuroendocrine cell activation one wonders whether basally active secretory cells that are physiologically activated do not only change the quantity but also the quality of their secretory output. a change in output quality would imply an involvement of the machinery responsible for the biosynthesis of the secretory cargo. in this study we tested this hypothesis by exploring the biosynthetic machinery in the basally active and hyperactive xenopus melanotrope cells, in particular the implications of secretory cell induction of the golgi-based posttranslational processing of secretory cargo proteins. we find profound differences in pomc n-glycosylation and sulphation between the hyperactive and the basally active melanotrope cells. our experiments indicate that in the hyperactive melanotropes the golgi apparatus lacks sufficient glycosylation and sulphation capacity to properly process the high amounts of newly synthesised pomc.

RESULTS
biosynthesis of  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc in the melanotrope cells of black- and white-adapted xenopus
previous biosynthetic studies have shown that in xenopus melanotrope cells pomc is initially synthesised as a  <dig> k prohormone that is subsequently cleaved to an n-terminal, glycosylated ~ <dig> k pomc protein  <cit> . in activated melanotrope cells, two forms of the ~ <dig> k product exist, namely a major product  named  <dig> k pomc and a minor product  termed  <dig> k* pomc that has a slightly higher apparent molecular weight  <cit> . the  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc products have the same protein backbone and differ only in their n-glycans  <cit> . to investigate the production of the  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc products in the hyperactive melanotrope cells from ba frogs  and the basally active melanotrope cells from wa animals , we used metabolic cell labelling to perform biosynthetic pulse-chase analyses. following a  <dig> minutes pulse and three hours chase period, newly synthesised  <dig> k pomc represented the major ~ <dig> k pomc-derived product in both the ba melanotrope cells and their medium. in contrast, the wa melanotrope cells produced and secreted almost exclusively the  <dig> k* pomc product . apomorphine did not significantly affect the biosynthesis and processing of pomc, but effectively inhibited secretion from the ba and the wa cells , indicating that in the ba and the wa cells the pomc-derived products were released via the regulated secretory pathway.

dynamics in the biosynthesis of  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc in the melanotrope cells of black-adapted xenopus
next, we wondered about the dynamics of  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc biosynthesis in the hyperactive melanotrope cells. for this purpose, we pulse labelled neurointermediate lobes  from ba animals for ten minutes and chased the lobes for various time periods. interestingly, following short chase periods  <dig> k* pomc was the most prominent product produced in the melanotrope cells, whereas after longer chase periods  <dig> k pomc became more prominent.  <dig> k* pomc was initially also the major product released into the medium, but following the longer chase periods  <dig> k pomc became the prominent product released . thus, the initial appearance of mainly  <dig> k* in the hyperactive cells and media shows that the production of  <dig> k* pomc is faster than that of  <dig> k pomc. wa melanotrope cells essentially produce only  <dig> k* pomc and thus no dynamics in  <dig> k/ <dig> k* pomc biosynthesis was observed in these cells.

glycosylation of  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc in the melanotrope cells of black- and white-adapted xenopus
we then deglycosylated the newly synthesised proteins produced in the ba and the wa melanotrope cells with peptidyl n-glycosidase f , an enzyme that removes all n-linked glycogroups irrespective of their composition. we found that in each sample the  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc products were shifted to a single ~ <dig>  k product . thus, the  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc products from the ba as well as from the wa cells differ only in their n-linked glycogroups.

to examine the difference in the glycogroups in more detail, we deglycosylated the newly synthesised proteins with endoglycosidase h , an enzyme that selectively removes high-mannose n-glycans. we observed that in ba nils  <dig> k pomc was endoh-sensitive , suggesting that it had not yet undergone complex glycosylation. since the proteolytic cleavage of  <dig> k pomc starts already in the trans-golgi network  and continues in the tgn-derived immature secretory granules  <cit> ,  <dig> k pomc is proteolytically processed soon after it has encountered the golgi-enzymes that process the n-glycans to endoh-resistant conformations. therefore, the majority of the endoh-sensitive  <dig> k pomc molecules may have resided in a pre-golgi compartment and may not yet have encountered the enzymes that confer endoh-resistance. to prevent the proteolytic processing of  <dig> k pomc and thus cause the prohormone to accumulate in a post-golgi compartment, we performed pulse-chase experiments with ba nils in the presence of bafilomycin, a drug that inhibits acidification of the tgn/secretory granules. surprisingly, in the presence of bafilomycin the amount of endoh-resistant  <dig> k pomc increased only marginally . in line with this observation, the vast majority of the  <dig> k pomc processing product that was produced in the absence of bafilomycin was endoh-sensitive as well . these findings suggest that ba melanotropes are unable to convert the n-glycans on pomc to complex glycogroups. remarkably, in wa melanotropes a significant portion of the  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc molecules was endoh-resistant  showing that, while the prohormone passes through the golgi apparatus, the wa cells possess the capability to convert a substantial portion of the n-glycans of pomc to a complex form. interestingly, a part of the  <dig> k* pomc molecules in wa cells was still endoh-sensitive. hence,  <dig> k* pomc does apparently not represent a single product but rather constitutes  <dig> k pomc products with slightly different n-glycans. possibly, these differentially glycosylated  <dig> k* pomc products represent intermediates of high-mannose to complex glycosylated  <dig> k pomc products.

sulphation of  <dig> k pomc in the melanotrope cells of black- and white-adapted xenopus
in addition to n-glycosylation, pomc is also posttranslationally modified by sulphation. we therefore wondered whether pomc produced in ba and wa melanotropes differs not only in its glycosylation but also in its sulphation state. to determine the relative amount of pomc-sulphation, we pulse labelled the cells for  <dig> minutes simultaneously with lysine and sulphate, and determined the amount of each label incorporated into newly synthesised  <dig> k pomc. we observed that the relative amount of sulphated  <dig> k pomc was ~ <dig> -fold higher in wa than in ba cells . sulphate-modifications can be attached directly to the protein backbone through a tyrosine residue or indirectly through n-glycans.

deglycosylation of sulphate labelled  <dig> k pomc with pngasef did not reduce its level , indicating that xenopus pomc is not glyco- but rather tyrosine-sulphated. the sulfinator prediction program  <cit>  indeed predicts a sulphation site on tyrosine residue  <dig>  in the c-terminal half of xenopus  <dig> k pomc.

deglycosylation with endoh revealed that essentially all sulphated pomc from ba cells was endoh-sensitive, whereas ~50% of the sulphated pomc from wa cells was endoh-resistant . the ratio of endoh-sensitive to -resistant sulphate-labelled  <dig> k pomc from wa cells is similar to that of methionine/cysteine-labelled  <dig> k pomc from wa cells , suggesting that the sulphation machinery does not discriminate between complex and non-complex glycosylated  <dig> k pomc.

biosynthesis of  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc in cycloheximide-treated melanotrope cells of black-adapted xenopus
the results described above showed that in the golgi apparatus of ba melanotrope cells only a small portion of  <dig> k pomc was fully complex glycosylated and sulphated, whereas in the golgi of wa cells the majority of the pomc molecules was complex glycosylated and sulphated. we hypothesised that the golgi apparatus of the hyperactive ba melanotrope cells is not able to fully complex glycosylate and sulphate the tremendous amounts of secretory cargo. to test our hypothesis, we pulse labelled and chased ba nils for three hours in the presence of various concentrations of the protein synthesis-inhibiting drug cycloheximide. in the absence of cycloheximide, pomc biosynthesis and processing proceeded normally . with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor, protein biosynthesis in the melanotrope cells decreased until a nearly complete inhibition was reached at  <dig> μg/ml cycloheximide. interestingly, at low cycloheximide concentrations   <dig> k pomc constituted the predominant processing product, whereas at  <dig> ng/ml  <dig> k* pomc became the more prevalent form and at  <dig> μg/ml and higher cycloheximide concentrations  <dig> k* pomc was even the only form produced . next, we deglycosylated the newly synthesised proteins and found that the  <dig> k* pomc produced in the presence of cycloheximide was indeed endoh-resistant and thus complex glycosylated. in addition, cycloheximide treatment led to a clear increase in endoh-resistant  <dig> k pomc . these findings support our hypothesis that the golgi apparatus of the hyperactive melanotrope cells is not able to fully complex glycosylate and sulphate the vast amount of secretory cargo it encounters.

discussion
in this study, we set out to examine whether hyperactive neuroendocrine secretory cells are able to tune their secretory pathway such that they can comply with the extremely high demands for proper posttranslational modifications of the vast amounts of secretory cargo. we chose as a model cell system the physiologically inducible xenopus melanotrope cells that produce pomc as their main secretory cargo. we show that the hyperactive ba melanotrope cells produced  <dig> k pomc as the major and  <dig> k* pomc as a minor pomc-derived product. in contrast, the basally active wa melanotropes produced almost exclusively  <dig> k* pomc. the difference between the  <dig> k and  <dig> k* pomc products concerned only the n-glycan moiety and not the protein backbone. the  <dig> k pomc product from wa and ba cells as well as most of the  <dig> k* pomc from ba cells was endoh sensitive and thus non-complex glycosylated. remarkably, a significant portion of the  <dig> k* pomc from wa cells was endoh resistant and thus complex glycosylated. these findings show that the maturation of n-glycans on the pomc molecule depended on the biosynthetic activity of the cells, and was heterogeneous and incomplete , in particular in ba melanotropes. in addition, the extent of pomc tyrosine sulphation differed greatly in the ba and wa cells. thus, the ba and wa melanotropes secrete a collection of differentially glycosylated and sulphated pomc-derived products. interestingly, in ba melanotrope cells the rate of biosynthesis of  <dig> k* pomc was higher than that of  <dig> k pomc. in addition,  <dig> k* pomc was released into the incubation medium faster than  <dig> k pomc, presumably as a result of the faster biosynthesis of  <dig> k* pomc. the  <dig> k* pomc product from ba cells may well originate from a pool of  <dig> k pomc molecules travelling relatively fast through the secretory pathway  or, alternatively, bypassing certain machinery-containing subcompartments of the secretory pathway. clearly, the secretory pathways in the wa and ba melanotrope cells differently fulfil the needs for posttranslational prohormone processing.

the reduced degree of n-glycan processing and sulphation of pomc in ba melanotropes led us to hypothesise that in hyperactive melanotropes the golgi apparatus is not equipped with sufficient machinery to fully complex glycosylate and sulphate cargo molecules. if true, a reduction in the amount of cargo passing through the golgi apparatus should increase the fraction of complex glycosylated and sulphated pomc. to test this hypothesis, we chose to reduce pomc biosynthesis by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis. in the presence of increasing concentrations of cycloheximide, protein biosynthesis was indeed reduced, whereas the relative amount of complex glycosylated pomc had clearly increased. in summary, we show that in neuroendocrine xenopus melanotrope cells that have been physiologically induced to hyperactive secretory cells the golgi apparatus is not sufficiently equipped to allow full posttranslational processing of the high amounts of secretory cargo produced. as a result, the hyperactive xenopus melanotropes produce a repertoire of pomc-derived products that are heterogeneously glycosylated and sulphated. the observed heterogeneous posttranslational modifications of secretory cargo do not appear to be restricted to the ba xenopus melanotropes. for example, in bovine posterior pituitaries ~50% of the pomc-derived protein β-lipotropin is sulphated  <cit> , only 5–10% of the n-terminal portion of xenopus pomc is processed to γ-msh peptides  <cit>  and a  <dig> k pomc product  is only partly o-glycosylated and cleaved  <cit> . unfortunately, these studies did not include an analysis of the effect of physiological cell activation on the posttranslational modifications of pomc.

since previous studies that have examined the effect of the differential glycosylation and sulphation events on the biosynthesis, intracellular processing, biostability and secretion of pomc are contradictory and inconclusive  <cit> , the implications -if any- of the affected posttranslational modifications remain unclear, including their effect on the bioactivity of the pomc-derived products. nevertheless, glycosylation and sulphation are known to alter biological properties, such as the stability and bioactivity of secretory cargo proteins. for example, in frogs the glycans on pomc may provide stability against non-specific proteolysis or degradation  <cit>  and the bioactivity of the n-terminal portion of bovine and mouse pomc depends on  n- and o-glycosylation  <cit> . also, the bioactivity of a variety of peptide hormones, e.g. gastrin, cholecystokinin, leu-enkephalin, prolactin, thyrotropin, gonadotropins and follicle stimulating hormone, is known to be influenced by posttranslational modifications  <cit> . furthermore, a number of signalling pathways, such as the notch signalling pathway and chemokine signalling and immune regulation pathways, depend on the proper posttranslational modifications of the extracellular signalling molecule or the receptor  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that the differentially glycosylated and sulphated products secreted by the hyperactive and the basally active melanotropes vary in their bioactivities, and thus that the ba and wa cells have different secretory signals.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that the golgi apparatus of the hyperactive melanotrope cells is apparently equipped with the appropriate machinery to complex glycosylate and sulphate pomc molecules, but the quantity of the machinery is not sufficient to fully process the vast amounts of pomc passing through the secretory pathway of ba melanotropes. the shortcomings in protein processing events that we have observed in the hyperactive xenopus melanotrope cells may also occur in other hyperactive secretory cell systems, including in neuroendocrine tumour cells and immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells, suggesting that our findings may well have broader implications.
