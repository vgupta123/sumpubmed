BACKGROUND
the heterotrophic bacterial community is the most important biological compartment involved in the transformation and mineralization of the organic matter in aquatic systems. it also constitutes a key source of prey for higher trophic levels, i.e. primarily flagellates, but also ciliates and the metazooplankton  <cit> . our conceptual understanding of the role of heterotrophic bacteria in pelagic systems and in global biochemical cycles is closely linked to our understanding of how their growth rate, abundance, distribution and diversity are controlled  <cit> .

different biotic and abiotic factors have been identified as players acting on the activity and composition of the bacterial community, and resources  are considered one of the main factors controlling this community  <cit> . however, the roles of bacterivory and viral lysis are not insignificant, and may also strongly affect bacterial abundance, activity and structure. both heterotrophic nanoflagellate  grazing and viral lysis are known to be variable causes of bacterial mortality, and can be responsible for  <dig> to 60% of daily bacterial loss in lacustrine systems . in addition, both processes can impact the size distribution of bacterial communities through 'size-selective mortality' for flagellates  <cit>  and 'host-specificity' for viruses  <cit> . moreover, viruses can act indirectly on bacterial structure throughout the release of cell debris during lysis activity  and inorganic nutrients) enhancing in fine growth and production of some bacterial groups  <cit> . indeed, whether cells are grazed or lysed can have different ecological and biogeochemical consequences, as the implications for the matter and energy flow through the microbial web will be very different  <cit> . typically, high rates of viral cell lysis may generate a recycling of nutrients and organic matter at the base of the food web and therefore, less carbon and nutrients may reach higher trophic levels, a process referred to as the viral shunt  <cit> . in contrast, if bacteria are grazed by flagellates, nutrients and energy can reach higher trophic levels via the connection between the microbial loop and the classical food chain  <cit> . thus, these processes can significantly influence the production of dissolved organic carbon and the recycling of nutrients  <cit>  and can impact/modify not only bacterial diversity  <cit>  but also the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning  <cit> .

a few studies have investigated the individual effects of flagellates or viruses on bacterial communities in terms of abundance, production and diversity . however, their combined effects on bacteria, and the comparison between individual and combined effects are still limited  <cit> . according to these studies, both viral lysis and protistan bacterivory may act additively to reduce bacterial production and sustain diversity, which could explain the less pronounced blooming species in heterotrophic bacterioplankton than in phytoplankton  <cit> . however, the opposite effect has also been reported  <cit> . moreover, comparisons of the combined effects of viruses and flagellates on the bacterial community according to the trophic status of aquatic systems are scarce and until now, no information has been made available for lacustrine systems. to the best of our knowledge, zhang et al.  <cit>  are the only authors who have investigated these effects taking into account a trophic range within a coastal ecosystem, and the same trend was highlighted  <cit> . according to these authors, a shift of predator control mechanisms from flagellates in oligotrophic systems to viruses in eutrophic systems could explain the results.

in this study, we collected samples from two peri-alpine lakes  with substantial differences in their trophic state  and we developed treatments with either individual or combined predators of the bacterial community using a fractionation approach . our main goal was to examine the separated and combined effect of viruses, grazers and small autotrophs  on the bacterial abundance, production and structure, and to compare it in different environmental conditions. since the importance of both predators  as potential controlling forces of the bacterial community may display seasonal variations in these lakes  <cit> , this study was carried out at two contrasting periods , characterized by substantial differences in both the dynamics and structure of microbial communities and environmental conditions  <cit> .

our main findings are that both viral lysis and flagellated bacterivory act additively to sustain bacterial production, probably through a cascading effect from grazer-mediated resource enrichment, whereas their effects on the bacterial community structure remain more subtle. on the whole, the combined effects of viruses and flagellates showed the same trend in both lakes annecy and bourget.

RESULTS
initial conditions
in situ characteristics of the study sites
lake bourget is an elongated and north-south oriented lake situated in the western edge of the alps . lake annecy is located in the eastern part of france, at a distance of approx.  <dig> km from the former, . from the end of march to mid-july , in situ temperatures of the two study sites varied between  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, while the dissolved oxygen varied more modestly, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg l- <dig> . differences in the concentration of nutrients  between lake annecy and lake bourget were principally recorded during the early spring experiments , with values twice to three-times higher in lake bourget  than in lake annecy  . chl a concentration was relatively low  for the four experiments . the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig>  viruses between  <dig>  and  <dig> ×  <dig> virus ml- <dig>  heterotrophic nanoflagellates  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig>  pigmented nanoflagellates  between  <dig>  and  <dig> ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig>  and picocyanobacteria between  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig>  these parameters were significantly different  between the four experiments , indicating distinct biological characteristics at initial sampling. seasonal difference in the picocyanobacterial abundance was monitored  in both lakes , with values  <dig> - to two-times higher in summer  than in early spring . hnf and pnf abundances were significantly higher in lake annecy than in lake bourget . in contrast, viral abundances were always lower in the oligotrophic lake annecy.

conditions in experimental bottles - effect of filtration
the < 5-μm prefiltration removed a relatively small fraction of both hnf and pnf , whereas the <  <dig> -μm filtration removed, as expected, all of them . at the start of the experiments, in vf  and vfa  treatments, hnf abundances varied between  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig> , pnf between  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig> , and picocyanobacteria between  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig>  corresponding to  <dig> to 72% of in situ abundances. comparatively, a small fraction of the picocyanobacterial community passed through the <  <dig> -μm filter and only  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig> were recorded in treatment v , i.e.  <dig> to 5% of in situ abundance . in contrast, filtration through  <dig>  μm resulted in a small loss of bacterial and viral abundances  whereas after 5-μm filtration, loss never exceeded 4% for heterotrophic bacteria and 13% for viruses. at the beginning of the incubation, heterotrophic bacteria and viral abundances, in the four treatments of all experiments varied between  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cell ml- <dig> and between  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> virus ml- <dig>  respectively . overall, we succeeded in obtaining incubations with strongly contrasting predator pressure  and, with negligible loss to the abundances of both bacteria and viruses, when compared to in situ conditions.

effect of treatments on viral abundance and production
viral abundance only varied by a small degree  in lake annecy, while it varied greatly in lake bourget particularly during the lb <dig> experiment . in both la <dig> and la <dig> experiments, the temporal trend of viral abundance revealed different patterns according to the treatment: viral abundance increased in vf and v treatment, while in the vfa treatment no significant evolution  was recorded . in lake bourget, viral abundance increased during the four days of incubation in all treatments, except in treatment v of the lb <dig> experiment. at the end of incubation, the increase in viral abundance in vf and vfa was significantly higher than in treatment v  in la <dig> , lb <dig>  and lb <dig>  . however, the opposite was true for la <dig> . the stimulation of viral abundance was 3-fold higher in lake bourget  than in lake annecy   and significantly different between seasons for each lake .

similarly to viral abundance, viral production increased without exception from the beginning to the end of the experiments, particularly in vfa and vf treatments whatever the lake . viral production varied between a minimum of  <dig>  ×  <dig> virus ml- <dig> h- <dig>  and a maximum of  <dig>  ×  <dig> virus ml- <dig> h- <dig>  , which corresponded to  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells lysed ml- <dig> d- <dig>  respectively . viral production in vfa and vf were, in most cases, significantly different , over the course of the incubation, being on average 21% higher  than in v treatments in both lakes . stimulation of viral production seemed to be significantly higher  in lake bourget  than in lake annecy , while no significant seasonal differences  were recorded for either lake.

the significant difference between bacterial growth rate in v treatment and vfa/vf treatments was tested using anova. *, p <  <dig> ; **, p <  <dig> .

effects of treatments on bacterial abundance, production and mortality
bacterial abundance increased throughout the experiments, particularly during the lb <dig> experiment . concentrations were significantly higher in vfa and vf than in treatment v . concentrations in vfa and vf were in most cases similar in lake annecy, when compared to each other , in contrast to the significant differences observed in the samples issued from lake bourget, with higher bacterial abundance in treatment vfa than vf. at the end of the incubation, the increase in bacterial abundance  in treatment vfa was significantly higher than in treatment v  . in the four experiments, bacterial abundance was significantly higher   in treatment vfa than in v. in the vf treatment, bacterial abundance was significantly higher  in la <dig> , lb <dig>  and lb <dig>  than in treatment v. no significant difference was observed in la <dig> . stimulation of bacterial abundance was significantly different between lakes   and between seasons with highest values measured in summer .

during the incubation period, bacterial production fluctuated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μgc l- <dig> h- <dig> in la <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  μgc l- <dig> h- <dig> in la <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  μgc l- <dig> h- <dig> in lb <dig> and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μgc l- <dig> h- <dig> in lb <dig> . following bacterial abundance evolution, a significant increase in the bacterial production  was also recorded throughout the period of incubation. for both lakes, bacterial production was often higher in treatment v than in both vfa and vf during the early spring experiments . after  <dig> h of incubation, the stimulation of bacterial production  and the grazers treatments ) was observed in all experiments and averaged 27% in treatment vfa and  <dig> % in treatment vf when compared to v . the highest stimulation was observed in vfa during the lb <dig> experiment . overall, the bacterial production was significantly different  between the three treatments for the four experiments, with the highest values observed in most cases in vfa and vf . in contrast to the bacterial abundance, a significant difference in the stimulation of bacterial production was only noted between seasons , with the highest values for summer experiments .

bacterial growth rate fluctuated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  d- <dig> after either  <dig> h or  <dig> h of incubation , with the lowest values recorded during early spring experiments . the presence of flagellates did not induce a reduction of bacterial abundance and the estimation of bacterial loss rates over time generally led to negative values, showing enhanced bacterial growth. in lake annecy, this positive impact on bacterial growth was only significant in the la <dig> experiment , and was observed in both vf  and vfa . in lake bourget, the two experiments  showed the same effect on bacterial growth, with the highest values observed in vfa treatment .

bacterial mortality due to viral lysis activity was estimated to range between  <dig>  d- <dig> and  <dig>  d- <dig>  with the highest values obtained during summer experiments . differences between v and vfa/vf treatments indicated a significant increase in the lysis mortality rate after  <dig> h incubation in both lb <dig>  and lb <dig>  and this enhancement was maintained until the end  . in la <dig> and la <dig>  a significant difference between v and the other treatments was observed at the end of incubation, accompanied with an increase in lysis mortality rate in la <dig> , and a decrease in la <dig> .

effects of treatments on the bacterial community structure
among the eight sequenced bands, b <dig>  was present in all treatments. from this band, ten sequences out of  <dig> obtained were related to the genus curvibacter , the two other sequences corresponding to the genus burkholderidia  . three other sequenced bands were visible in all treatments but they increased significantly in intensity at the end of incubation . these three excised bands were related to the phylum actinobacteria  . finally, the three last bands chosen to be sequenced appeared  or disappeared  at the end of incubation . these ones were all affiliated to the phylum actinobacteria . note that the excised band b <dig> , related to the phylum cyanobacteria , disappeared at the end of the incubation in both vf and v treatments.

cluster analyses based on quantification of the band position and intensity  showed that, for each lake, the bacterial community structure was clearly different according to the period  . in lake annecy, different responses could be observed following our manipulations: in spring, the effect of time  clearly affected the bacterial structure. in summer, the differences in the structure induced by the size fractionation were the strongest, and sample discrimination was clearly linked to the fractionation . similar patterns were obtained for lake bourget in summer. finally, treatment vfa was highly divergent from v and vf  during the early spring experiment for lake bourget.

discussion
experimental approach
in order to study the influence of both predation pressure and the autotrophic activity on bacterial community of lakes annecy and bourget, we carried out a fractioning approach and performed incubation in either darkness or ambient light. the originality and strength of this study comes from the fact that such experiments were conducted  in two ecosystems with either oligotrophic or mesotrophic status and  at two distinct periods of the year  where microbial planktonic dynamics and composition are likely to display clear differences  <cit> . although the use of microcosms may introduce some bias into the development of microbial communities compared with those occurring naturally in the field , these experimental tools are still very useful for investigating how processes such as mortality factors induce temporal variation in bacterial dynamics, structure and activity  <cit> . incubation time  coupled with the volume of microcosms  considered in this study have previously been used successfully in other experimental studies  <cit> . we assumed that our design was thus realistic enough compared to the generation time of microorganisms and aimed to obtain significant changes in bacterial and viral activity  <cit> . a comparison of virus and flagellate abundances at the onset of the experiments with in situ conditions and among treatments with different viral and flagellate effects was successful. however, the experimental protocol resulted in a reduction of hnf at the start of the experiment and we thus might have underestimated their influence. clear effects of hnf were observed at the end of the experiment, when flagellate abundance was about twice as high as in situ .

grazing effect on viral activity
according to the model of miki and yamamura  <cit> , grazers should reduce the role of the viral loop. as viral production was higher in vf and vfa treatments than in v in most cases, particularly after  <dig> h incubation, our results instead suggested a stimulation of viral activity in the presence of grazers. such a stimulation of viral production by the presence of small eukaryotes  was observed in all experiments for the two lakes. these results corroborate the findings of jacquet et al.  <cit>  who observed a clear and positive relationship between flagellate concentration and vibm  in lake bourget  at three different periods of the year , suggesting a synergistic cooperation between grazer and virus activity. our new results extend the occurrence of this process at other periods of the year and in the oligotrophic lake annecy. similar beneficial effects of protozoan grazing on viruses have been reported in various lacustrine systems with different trophic statuses  <cit> . this means that the trophic status cannot be 'used' as an environmental factor to change the balance between positive and negative effects of flagellates on viruses  <cit> , and it is likely that there are probably different processes involved in enhancing viral activities in response to grazing activity  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, Šimek et al.  <cit>  were first to suggest that protozoan grazing may influence and increase viral lysis. from that time, other studies reported such a synergistic effect in contrast to freshwater systems  <cit> . nevertheless, an antagonistic interaction between these two compartments was also noted elsewhere  <cit> . mechanisms by which hnf affect viral activity are still unclear and many hypotheses have been proposed to explain such a cooperative interaction . in brief, grazing activity could stimulate bacterial growth rates, by releasing organic and inorganic nutrients. higher bacterial growth rates might be associated with enhanced receptor formation on cell surface which may result in a greater chance of phage attachment and in fine higher infection frequencies. thus, grazer stimulation of viral proliferation could occur through cascading effects from grazer-mediated resource enrichment  <cit> . we observed, in this study, a strong stimulation of bacterial production in treatments with grazers which may corroborate this assumption in both lakes. a link between infection and host production has been reported previously  and, recently, experimental studies showed that viruses may preferentially lyse active cells  <cit> . our results showed that autotrophic activity contributed to this stimulation, mainly in the early summer experiment , while heterotrophic flagellates were always involved in this positive feedback. a shift in the bacterial community structure could also contribute to the synergistic interaction observed in this study. according to weinbauer et al.  <cit> , grazing can favour species which are capable of rapid growth and resistant to grazing, which may stimulate viral infection. our results also seemed to support this hypothesis since both high bacterial production and specific bands were only observed in treatments vf and vfa.

stimulation of viral production was much more variable between lakes than between seasons and it was clearly higher in lake bourget. this suggests that environmental conditions encountered in the mesotrophic system might promote higher viral activity compared to more oligotrophic conditions. this hypothesis agrees with lymer et al.  <cit>  or pradeep and sime-ngando  <cit>  who observed, during a microcosm experiment, an enhancement of both viral abundance and fic  in p-enriched samples as a result of nutrient stimulation of bacterial growth, which in turn enhanced viral activity. however, it is noteworthy here that although phosphorus concentration was 2-fold higher in lake bourget than in lake annecy , no significant difference was recorded in bacterial production between the two lakes . some studies have suggested that nutrient availability may have an important influence on viral life strategies . as lysogenic infection is considered the most favourable method of bacterial infection in water characterized by low bacterial abundance and primary production, this may also explain the relatively weak stimulation of viral production observed in lake annecy compared to lake bourget  <cit> .

in lake annecy, and in contrast to viral production, the effects of flagellate presence on viral abundance seemed to be highly variable between the two periods . this variation revealed viral abundance stimulation in early-spring  and repression in summer , for both treatments . this result could suggest a direct grazing of flagellates on viruses during summer. virivory by flagellates has been previously reported  <cit>  and according to domaizon et al.  <cit> , all flagellates do not act similarly because of large differences between taxon-specifc ingestion rates. during our study, heterotrophic flagellates were mainly represented by oikomonas . also, the grazing impact of flagellates on viruses has always been reported to be relatively low, resulting in < 4% loss  <cit> . hence, direct grazing of flagellates on viruses was unlikely to explain the repression of viral abundance in la <dig>  other factors should be invoked  <cit>  and would need further investigation.

effect of both flagellates and viruses on bacterial activity
higher bacterial production in both vf and vfa treatments than v suggested that grazers and viruses acted additively to sustain  bacterial activity in lake annecy and lake bourget. such bacterial growth and activity stimulation in the presence of grazers and viruses has been previously reported in the oligotrophic sep reservoir, massif central, france  <cit> . however, the control and reduction of bacterial production by the two mortality agents have been observed in other aquatic systems  <cit> . such variability in possible responses could be due to the initial bacterial community composition and environmental conditions.

the increase in bacterial production with the presence of both predators  could be explained by the fact that grazing activity and viral lysis are likely to release inorganic and organic nutrients which may stimulate bacterial activity. obviously, the absence of direct measurements of grazing rates of flagellates on heterotrophic bacteria communities, for instance using fluorescently labelled bacteria   <cit> , prevented us from drawing firm conclusions about the grazing pressure of hnf on bacteria and our results should be considered in light of that. however, it has been suggested that a minimal proportion of  <dig>  heterotrophic bacteria for one heterotrophic flagellate is characteristic of microbial food webs in which flagellates preferentially consume bacteria  <cit> . the value for this ratio was higher than  <dig>  in each treatment  and for each experiment . indeed it varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bacteria per flagellate in lake annecy , and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in lake bourget , suggesting that heterotrophic bacteria were abundant enough to support the development of the heterotrophic flagellates that were present.

seasonal variability in the stimulation of bacterial production seemed to be more important than the trophic status variability, with highest mean values recorded in summer , a period which corresponds to low total phosphorus conditions and high temperature in surface waters . thus, the input of nutrient resources by viral and grazing activities, under such summer conditions, is likely to stimulate the bacterial community much more than under the cold early-spring conditions . moreover, thomas et al.  <cit>  observed that the abundance of hdna  is lower in spring than in summer in lake bourget , and this group is considered to be more active in comparison to ldna   <cit> . this could also explain the low stimulation of bacterial production in early spring compared to that in summer.

for most experiments , the stimulation of bacterial production, at the end of experiments, was much higher in vfa than in the vf treatment  which could be attributed to an increase in substrate availability and regenerated nutrients, resulting from grazing pressure of flagellates on both heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic communities, in treatment vfa  <cit> . nevertheless, the opposite situation was observed in lake annecy during the summer period  suggesting weaker competition by the bacterial community for nutrient resources in the presence of autotrophs, at this period. as a possible explanation, the abundance of autotrophs  was indeed 2- to 4-fold higher in summer than in early spring while bacterial abundance was 2-fold lower .

impact of hnf on bacterial community structure
we are aware that the dgge fingerprinting method presents some bias and only reflects the microorganism populations that are present at relatively high concentrations. for example, while muyzer et al.  <cit>  claimed that the reported sensitivity of dgge is 1% of the template dna, casamayor et al.  <cit>  reported that the number of bands is related to the number of populations that account for more than  <dig> - <dig> % of the total cell counts. in addition, some other bias such as insufficient or preferential disruption of cells during the dna extraction step, amplification bias  and band co-migration in the dgge gel can occur and consequently over- or underestimate the number of bands. however, such limitations are not specific to dgge and may also be found in other molecular fingerprinting techniques  <cit> . therefore, it must be kept in mind that only major changes in the bacterial community composition could be monitored using dgge. that is exactly what we observed in this study as all sequenced bands belonged to actinobacteria and proteobacteria, known to be the most dominant phyla in lakes  <cit> . thus our results have to be interpreted with caution because the structure of some "non-dominant" phyla, non-detectable with the dgge technique, could have changed according to the treatments performed in this study.

we found that some bands were specific to each treatment suggesting that some bacterial phylotypes were able to develop and thwart the predation pressure. such specificity has already been reported in other experimental studies  <cit> . phylotypes, observed in both vfa and vf treatments, were likely to be resistant to both grazing and infection  <cit> . nevertheless, the presence of phylotypes only in vf  might indicate sensitivity to the autotrophic activity as a result of a weak ability to compete for resources. phylotypes only present when viruses were the exclusive mortality agents would probably not be able to deal with the combined pressure of grazing and viral lysis  <cit>  or were strongly susceptible to grazing as already suggested by zhang et al.  <cit> . finally, the appearance of bands in both vf and vfa treatments could be due to phylotypes benefiting from the presence of predators, e.g., via the production of dom or by the removal of competitors.

a few previous experimental studies have shown that viruses can influence the presence or absence of specific bacterial phylotypes but, typically, result in a reduction of the number of detected phylotypes  <cit> . in contrast, we observed during the summer period an increase in the apparent richness when viruses were the exclusive mortality agents  giving support to the "killing the winner hypothesis". the stimulation of bacterial diversity in the presence of viruses was also reported in other lacustrine systems by weinbauer et al.  <cit>  and other experimental studies performed in coastal marine systems observed the same trend  <cit> . however, the relative stability of the apparent richness during early spring experiments, in treatment v, highlighted the seasonal variability of virus effects on bacterial diversity. this high variable impact of viruses upon bacterial community structure, already reported by hewson and fuhrman  <cit> , could suggest the influence of stochastic processes.

since no decrease in the number of bands was observed in either treatment vf or vfa, our result could not support the hypothesis of miki and yamamura  <cit>  according to whom grazing on infected cells "kills the killer of the winner" and thus reduces bacterial species richness. in some cases, the combined effect of viruses and flagellates on bacterial fingerprint diversity was more consistent than the effect of viruses alone, suggesting that both predators acted additively to sustain apparent richness. according to zhang et al.  <cit>  the 'killing the winner' hypothesis is mediated by both predators and not just by one type of predator . thus, all predators  could act additively in controlling the winners of the competition for resources and caused an increase in detectable phylotypes. in addition, stimulation of bacterial production and related viral lysis also suggested input of nutrients and substrates from grazing and lysis activities which may decrease the competition pressure within bacterial community, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the minor phylotypes  <cit> .

the effect of both predators on the bacterial diversity was not apparent in all experiments, suggesting more variability and complexity in the interactions between bacterial diversity, viruses and grazers than hitherto assumed. diverse patterns between predators and bacterial diversity were reported in other studies  <cit> . such variability could be explained by the change in the balance between bacterial production and protistan grazing  <cit>  or to chaotic behaviour due to competition among predators for the same prey  <cit> . overall, previous work performed in both lakes annecy and bourget, indicated that the strong complexity of the combined physico-chemical and biological parameters  is mainly responsible for the evolution of the bacterial community structure  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
many forms of interaction exist between the various components of the microbial loop including the viruses. our results highlight that viruses and flagellated grazers are likely to act together, synergistically, on bacterial activity and community structure. even at the community level, interactions between bacterioplankton, viruses and grazers are thus much more complex than hitherto assumed. more than ever, additional studies are needed to fully assess the factors responsible for the variability in the interactions between grazers, bacteria and viruses, especially in freshwater ecosystems, as well as their ecological significance for the microbial community structure/role and whole ecosystem functioning.
