BACKGROUND
human β-amyloid precursor protein  has been the subject of intense study since it was determined that it is the precursor of the β-amyloid, the main component of neuritic plaques found in patients with alzheimer's disease . important efforts have been made to investigate its neurotoxic effects in relation with its aggregation properties and its overexpression  <cit> .

beyond the pathogenic role of βa in humans, in the last  <dig> years a notable convergence of results point to the role of app holoprotein and its fragments in synaptic function. app is able to modulate a wide variety of neuronal responses such as neuritic growth, synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity and neuronal protection to excitotoxic damage  <cit> . based on the general structure of the protein and the conservation of different domains it has been suggested that app could function as a receptor  <cit> , a growth factor  <cit>  and a cell-cell or cell-substrate adhesion molecule  <cit> . administration of different peptides derived from the cleavage of app modulates memory in a positive as well as in a negative way, both in vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . in addition, ko animals show memory deficits  <cit> . nevertheless, the precise physiological function of app and its fragments remains to be clarified.

app protein belongs to a transmembrane protein family . homologous genes with conserved domains have been found in invertebrates: appl in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> ), appl in manduca sexta  <cit> , app in squid  and apl- <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . the homologous genes in drosophila and caenorhabditis are unique in their respective genomes, at variance with vertebrates in which more than one member of this family is present. in mammals, there is one app gene and two homologous genes  called aplp- <dig> y aplp- <dig>  <cit> . mammals' app and appl are localized in different tissues. however, drosophila appl expression is fundamentally in the central nervous system, with a molecular weight of 145kda  <cit> . appl is transported to the axonic terminal were it promotes development of new synapses  <cit> .

in the crab chasmaganathus memory model, repeated presentation of a visual danger stimulus  provokes the fading of the initial escape response  <cit>  that is actively replaced by a freezing response. fifteen or more spaced danger stimuli presentations induce an association between the iterated stimulus and contextual features  <cit> . a long-term memory is formed  which lasts at least for a week and entails protein and mrna synthesis  <cit> , activation of camp dependent protein kinase   <cit> ), activation of extracellular-signals regulated kinase   <cit>  and activation of the nf-κb transcription factor  <cit> . the administration of human β-amyloid peptides induces amnesia in the crab csm that is dependent of the level of aggregation of the peptide  <cit> .

here we partially cloned and sequenced a beta-amyloid precursor protein-like gene homologue in the crab chasmagnathus granulatus  and we studied its expression in the central nervous system and other tissues. we also analyzed the time course of gene and protein expression during long-term memory consolidation, observing a different expression profile compared to a passive control group. our results suggest a role of cappl during long-term memory formation.

RESULTS
partial cdna cloning and sequencing of cappl
we used a degenerate primer strategy to clone the cdna of the putative app homologue in the crab chasmagnathus granulathus and obtained a  <dig> bp fragment that codes for  <dig> aminoacids ,  similar to app or app-like proteins in both invertebrates  and vertebrates . given that the estimated size of full length cappl is 75kda , the partial cdna obtained codes for approximately 60% of the protein sequence . the sequenced fragment is consistent with a type i protein with a short cytoplasmic tail, a hydrophobic transmembrane region and a long extracellular domain. the regions not sequenced are a portion of the n-terminal extracellular region and a short stretch of the c-terminal cytoplasmic tail.

we aligned our fragment of cappl with h. sapiens app <dig>  d. melanogaster appl and c. elegans apl- <dig> using clustalw  <dig>   <cit>  . there were both similarities and important differences with other members of the app-like family. as expected, sequence similarity of cappl was highest with d. melanogaster appl . there is no observed sequence similarity with the β-amyloid peptide region present of vertebrates , a result consistent with its absence in the invertebrate app genes sequenced to date. as in other invertebrates, there are certain regions with a much higher degree of sequence similarity. using the same criteria as  <cit> , we assessed sequence identity in the e <dig> extracellular region , the c cytoplasmic region  and the sequence between e <dig> and the membrane spanning region . the fragment of cytoplasmic domain sequenced includes a putative g0-binding domain . additionally, there is a conserved n-glycosylation site present towards the c-terminal end of the e <dig> domain.

there are also important differences between cappl and other members of the app family. notably, the entire region between conserved extracellular domains e <dig> and e <dig> is missing, as is the n-terminal region of e <dig>  though this might be due to alternative splicing in the supraesophagic ganglion , we assessed several other tissues  and none of them had higher molecular weight cappl cdnas. this allows us to speculate that the cappl gene is indeed missing the corresponding coding regions. the other major difference is an acid rich domain present in cappl between e <dig> and the transmembrane region  are acid), also present in d. melanogaster appl.

characterization of cappl expression
we studied cappl gene expression using real time pcr. in a first approach we determined the gene expression pattern in different tissues: gills, muscles and two areas of the cns: supraesophageal and thoracic ganglia. we found that cappl is expressed in all tissues analyzed, with higher expression in gills, lower expression in muscles and similar intermediate expression in the nervous tissues .

we went on to analyze the presence of cappl protein product in the central brain and in different tissues of chasmagnathus. we employed a commercial antibody directed against the c-terminal ending of human-app protein in western blot assays. this antibody recognizes a highly conserved region of the protein, parts of which are present in the cloned fragment of the crab chasmagnathus. . we found the protein in all tissues studied. in nervous tissues  we detected two bands of 75kda and 48kda, respectively. in contrast, we found a high level of the 48kda band in muscle but we did not detect the 75kda band . pre-adsorption of the antibody with a peptide containing the conserved sequence mqqngyenpty showed an important reduction of both, 75kda and 48kda signals . we also performed immunoprecipitation assay  with this antibody from supraesophageal ganglia extracts. we found the presence of both bands in the ip but the 48kda band was also found in the mock control , suggesting that the 75kda band corresponds to specific recognition of cappl but the 48kda band, does not. thus, in the experiments performed to study protein levels only the 75kda band was analyzed.

we then studied cappl protein localization in the central brain of chasmagnathus by immunofluorescence of naïve animals in whole mount and sections. representative images obtained by confocal microscopy are presented in figure  <dig>  we found positive labeling in different areas of the brain. the labeling shown was bilateral and no stain was found in controls without primary antibody . the signal is appreciable in both neuropiles and neuronal clusters. in neuropiles the staining appears at processes and structures resembling synapses, and in the neuronal clusters the staining appears in the cytoplasm and nucleus. the protein distribution includes all three main divisions of the brain protocerebrum, deutocerebrum and tritocerebum, but showing a particular strong localization in four symmetrical processes, three neuropiles with its tracts and two neuropiles with no clear afference. the processes run in the anterior-posterior axis . the strongly stained neuropiles are the lateral antenna i neuropil  in the deutocerebrum, the tegumentary neuropil  and the antenna ii neuropil  in the tritocerebrum. the innervating connectives of all three neuropiles also show strong staining. these connectives are: the oculomotor nerve  and antenna i nerve  that inervate the lan, the omnv and the tegumentary nerve  that innervate the tn and the antenna ii nerve  that innervate the ann . the other two stained neuropiles found are the anterior medial protocerebral neuropil  in the protocerebrum and the median antenna i neuropil  in the deutocerebrum. the main somatic staining appears in clusters  <dig>  11- <dig> and  <dig> 

expression of cappl gene during memory consolidation
most studies on the physiological role of app family are centered on the protein. on the contrary, little is known about the expression and regulation of the app gene family, particularly in neuronal plasticity and memory processes. to our knowledge, no studies have been performed on the role in memory formation of the app family in invertebrates. with this in mind, the aim of this section was to determine if there were changes in cappl gene expression after ltm formation in the crab csm paradigm. four groups were formed. the trained group  had  <dig> presentations of the visual danger stimulus with an inter-trial interval  of  <dig> seconds, the active control group  was subjected to  <dig> stimulus presentations with  <dig> sec iti and the passive control group  was exposed to the actometer during the same period of time as other groups but no stimulus was presented. a naïve group  was formed with untreated animals to determine basal level of expression of untreated group. animals were anesthetized, the brains were removed at different time points after treatment and total rna was extracted. we analyzed relative levels of cappl mrna by real time pcr. figure 4a shows the results obtained immediately after training and figure 4b shows the results obtained at  <dig> hs after training. two way  anova yielded significant differences f =  <dig> ; lsd contrasts, tr- <dig> vs tr- <dig>  p <  <dig> ; ca- <dig> vs ca- <dig>  p <  <dig> ). we observed an augmentation of cappl gene expression in tr and ac groups of about a 50% above nv group immediately after training. on the contrary, a reduction of about 50% was observed in pc. at  <dig> h, all experimental groups presented a reduction of cappl gene expression with respect to nv group.

cappl protein levels during memory consolidation
in this section, we analyzed cappl protein levels at different time points after learning. we employed the same groups of animals described above and time points were also coincident in order to compare both results. after the training session, supraesophageal ganglia were obtain and were subjected to a total protein extraction protocol. we performed western blot assay using anti- c-terminal app and anti-actin antibodies and the results are expressed as cappl levels relative to actin and nv group. figure 5a shows the results immediately after training. we found an increase in the protein levels in the tr and ac group. results of protein levels from animals sacrificed  <dig> h after training are shown in figure 5b. in this case, tr and ac groups showed a reduced level. pc group levels were similar to nv levels in both time points analyzed  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , interaction f =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; lsd contrasts, tr- <dig> vs nv- <dig>  p <  <dig> ; tr- <dig> vs pc- <dig>  p <  <dig> ; ac- <dig> vs nv- <dig>  p <  <dig> ; ac- <dig> vs pc- <dig>  p <  <dig> ; tr- <dig> vs tr- <dig>  p <  <dig> ; ca- <dig> vs ca- <dig>  p <  <dig> ).

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in the present report we partially cloned and sequenced a member of the app family of proteins in crustacea. previously, app members were identified in several vertebrate species, including human, monkey, rat, mouse, frog, fish and four species in invertebrates: the insects drosophila melanogaster  and manduca sexta , the squid loligo pealei  and the worm caenorhabditis elegans   <cit> . the data provided by these sequences, together with our sequence in crab, indicate that app is a conserved family of transmembrane glycoproteins. moreover, transgenic studies in drosophila have shown that human app <dig> can rescue at least some of the deficits caused by the deletion of appl  <cit> , demonstrating that these proteins are functionally as well as structurally conserved.

characterization of cappl
we first characterized cappl gene and protein expression in the central brain and in different tissues of the crab. we found expression of cappl mrna and protein in all tissues analyzed, including the central nervous system. this distribution coincides with that described for different species where genes of this family were studied, excepting drosophila, whose expression is fundamentally in the central nervous system  <cit> . we only found one fragment by pcr amplification in all tissues studied, suggesting at first that only one transcript is present in this species. however, the fact that we observed only one amplified fragment does not rule out the possibility of an alternative splicing process, if the primers used recognized only one of the variants. the antibody revealed one specific protein in western blot assay of 75kda . this protein has a molecular weight similar to that described in mammals and it is smaller than the homologue found in drosophila. we found low mrna levels in muscle and the protein could not be detect by western blot, indicating very low expression in this tissue.

employing the same antibody used in western blot, we performed immunoflorescence assays and by confocal microscopy we determined cappl's presence in different areas of chasmagnathus granulatus central brain. the signal is appreciable in neurites, cytoplasm and nuclei. the presence of the intracellular domain in the nucleus after gamma cleavage of the app protein was previously reported  <cit> . the presence of cappl in the protocerebrum , suggests a role for this protein in neuronal plasticity processes. this neuropil is probably a main associative area where sensory information  coming from distinct organs is integrated. recent results from our laboratory indicate this area is involved in neuronal plasticity in csm . particularly striking is the presence of four neuritic projections coming from protocerebral tract, through the medial protocerebrum, making a chiasm at the tritocerebrum region, continuing through the oesophageal connectives to thoracic ganglia region . these connections could be involved in information transmission and processing from primary optic areas to the thoracic ganglia region, responsible for motor control responses. as the learning and memory task used is fundamentally visual, these findings suggest a role of cappl in the neural circuits that process such information.

expression profile of cappl during memory consolidation
we analyzed the cappl time course of expression at the level of mrna and protein. we found an increase in mrna levels immediately after training for the tr group and an inhibition for the pc group. these findings would suggest an involvement of cappl in memory formation. however, a similar increment was found in the ac group. the increment of the ac group suggests that this gene is probably regulated by neuronal activity, sensory stimulation, stress and/or motor response. we assume such interpretation taking into account that active controls received stimulus presentation and performed escape responses but were unable to induce ltm formation. the increase of expression found for the tr group could be explained in the same terms, indicating that gene induction is involved in general processes in csm consolidation. on the contrary, the exposure to the context without stimulation  reduces cappl mrna levels, whereas protein levels do not change. this result was also found in the  <dig> hs time point. indeed, the cappl mrna levels of all experimental groups  <dig> hours after training where below the nv level. a learning event initiates alteration of gene expression that contributes to synapse remodeling. there have been reports of transcriptional and translational control waves in memory consolidation mechanisms. multiple gene expression studies using microarrays have proposed a transcriptional inhibition of a wide number of genes between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after an inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm. among the involved genes are molecular adhesion proteins, which could contribute to synapses weakening in the pursuit of synaptic modulation facilitation, so new neuronal circuits can be establish  <cit> . keeping in mind that, among other functions, app could have a role as an adhesion molecule, this transcriptional and translational inhibition  <dig> hours after training could reflect synaptic weakening.

with regards to the cappl protein time course study, there is in general a correlation with gene expression levels.

this is the first report about the app homologue in a crustacean model. the study of this gene in invertebrate models has a comparative interest and may contribute to the understanding of the physiological role of this protein family in synaptic plasticity and memory and, eventually, could contribute to the understanding of its role in pathology.
