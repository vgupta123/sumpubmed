BACKGROUND
transposable elements  have been found in all eukaryotic genomes investigated  <cit> . the most numerous group of tes are long terminal repeat  retrotransposons, namely, the ty1-copia and ty3-gypsy superfamilies, which have become extremely abundant in plant genomes over time  <cit> . these ltr retrotransposons copy themselves through a process of replicative transposition and are thus able to increase the genome size of the host  <cit> . retrotransposon insertion in close proximity to or directly into genes greatly affects gene expression and function  <cit> . recombination between retrotransposons can cause large chromosomal rearrangements, including inversions, translocations, deletions and duplications  <cit> . hence, retrotransposons are an important source of genetic and phenotypic diversity in plants  <cit> .

potentially deleterious processes such as retrotransposition must be moderated so as not to have damaging effects on the host. therefore, ltr retrotransposons are epigenetically silenced  in plant genomes  <cit>  and have been under strong purifying selection pressure throughout much of evolutionary time  <cit> . ltr retrotransposons are also actively removed from the genomes of host species, although this process is much slower than retrotransposon proliferation  <cit> . retrotransposons also respond to various stress stimuli, such as environmental changes and polyploid formation  <cit> . usually, only a limited number of ltr retrotransposon families successfully populate the genome. for instance, only three families are responsible for doubling the genome size of oryza australiensis within the last three million years  <cit> , and nearly 10% of the barley genome is occupied by bare- <dig> copia-like elements  <cit> . in addition, bare- <dig> proliferation has been proposed as an evolutionary driving force in natural barley populations  <cit> .

most studies of te behavior have been restricted to large genomic projects, which tend to be focused on model organisms. little is known about te dynamics in natural populations or among related taxa, and even less is understood about the role of tes at the species or supra-species level, where they can modulate genome size and karyotype evolution in concert with polyploidy and chromosomal rearrangements.

an appropriate model group for evaluating the evolutionary dynamics of retrotransposons on the microevolutionary scale should exhibit reasonable monoploid genome size variation within a particular taxon . among angiosperm species in which both the ploidy level  and genome size are known  <cit> , one of the largest contrasts is reported in the genus eleocharis . e. acicularis  and e. palustris  differ almost 22-fold in somatic dna quantity at approximately the same ploidy level. this contrast is noticeable when compared with the majority of species in the family cyperaceae, which exhibit smaller genomes.

the genus eleocharis comprises more than  <dig> annual or perennial species of marsh and wetland habitats  <cit> . the species samples included in our study were selected to represent the genus phylogeny . here we analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of the ltr retrotransposons ty1-copia and ty3-gypsy in relation to genome size and chromosome number . in addition, we analyzed independent phylogenetic contrasts and signals  <cit>  to determine how this relationship is reflected in the phylogeny of eleocharis.

RESULTS
phylogeny of analyzed species
we reconstructed the phylogeny of the analyzed eleocharis species. the neighbor-joining tree shown in figure  <dig> is based on concatenated alignments of consensus its sequences and partial sequences of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  gene . the topology of the tree agrees with previously published phylogenies of eleocharis, with the subgenus limnochloa at the base of the tree, followed by the subgenera zinserlingia and scirpidium, and with the type subgenus  as the evolutionarily youngest taxon  <cit> .

correlated evolution of genome size and chromosome number in eleocharis
genome size was measured using flow cytometry . for most of the analyzed species, genome size is presented here for the first time . the somatic dna quantities estimated for e. acicularis  differ significantly from those reported in the plant dna c-values database . therefore, we sampled seven different populations and detected no significant intraspecific variation . eleocharis palustris ssp. waltersii  is widespread in great britain, whereas e. palustris ssp. palustris  is quite rare . thus, the value from the plant dna c-values database  refers to the former rather than the latter, which is in accordance with our observations .

1) chromosome numbers were taken from previous studies . for the remaining samples, chromosome numbers were counted by o. rotreklová and p. bureš .

2) an average of seven samples, each representing a different population .

compared with other cyperaceae and most other angiosperm genera, eleocharis species vary greatly in genome size . the size of eleocharis genomes  range from  <dig>  pg in e. cellulosa to  <dig> pg in e. sterneri , which is an almost 22-fold difference.

we found that genome size  is significantly correlated with chromosome number in the phylogeny of eleocharis , suggesting that polyploidy plays an important role in generating genome size variation between eleocharis species. this result is in strong contrast with the negative correlation found for the cyperaceae genus carex  <cit> , in which polyploidy is considered to be very rare  <cit> . such a negative correlation was also reported as a general pattern in the phylogenetic lineage comprising sister families juncaceae and cyperaceae  <cit> . the only exception to the observed trend is e. quinqueflora, which has a small genome  and high chromosome number . it is likely that a similar deviation also exists in species of the subgenus limnochloa, which are predicted to have small genomes based on the dna content estimated for e. cellulosa  and which have chromosome numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, the high chromosome numbers observed in the basal clades zinserlingia and limnochloa resulted rather from agmatoploidy  than polyploidy  <cit> , similar to carex . thus, higher polyploids appear to belong to the evolutionary youngest subgenus of eleocharis.

the contrast in genome size between basal and younger clades of the genus eleochris becomes more apparent if chromosome size is taken into account . it has been suggested that symploidy  is responsible for this pattern  <cit> . however, in addition to symploidy or agmatoploidy, which are the widespread chromosomal rearrangements generally thought to be responsible for dysploidy across the holokinetic family cyperaceae  <cit> , transposable element proliferation should also be considered .

to distinguish between the roles of tes and chromosomal rearrangements in chromosome size variation, we examined the relationship between te density  and average chromosome size . the c/n-value is a species-specific parameter calculated by dividing the amount of somatic dna by the number of somatic chromosomes  . if a change in c/n is only the result of a rearrangement, the te density in the whole genome should remain unchanged. on the other hand, if tes are active players, their density should mirror the changes in average chromosome size.

in the genus eleocharis, the observed c/n-values increase toward evolutionary younger taxa and show a highly significant phylogenetic signal . the small c/n in e. quinqueflora can be explained by agmatoploidy, whereas the increase in chromosome size in more recently diverged taxa  could result either from fusion or from the amplification of transposable elements, most likely ltr retrotransposons.

to assess the contribution of ltr retrotransposons to this c/n divergence, we analyzed and quantified partial sequences from both ltr retrotransposon superfamilies. we used previously described primers to isolate the reverse transcriptase sequences of ty1-copia and ty3-gypsy  <cit>  from all analyzed species. pcr, cloning and sequencing yielded  <dig> and  <dig> partial sequences of the reverse transcriptase sequences of ty1-copia and ty3-gypsy, respectively . blast comparison confirmed their homology to previously described copia-like or gypsy-like elements. to determine whether species with larger c/n values carry more retrotransposon copies, we quantified the reverse transcriptase sequences of ty1-copia and ty3-gypsy in each species using real-time pcr with the same pairs of primers . because the real-time pcr approach analyzed only a subset of retrotransposons, as defined by the specific primer pairs, dot blot quantification was also carried out in selected species to corroborate the real-time pcr results.

ty1-copia density correlates with c/n-value in the phylogeny of eleocharis
as expected, the te densities obtained from the dot blot quantification were higher  than the densities estimated by quantitative pcr . the estimates of both methods were positively correlated only for ty1-copia. however, the differences in ty3-gypsy density between analyzed species were very small and possibly below the resolution of both approaches, especially the dot blot analysis.

the calculated densities of ty1-copia and ty3-gypsy differed by one order of magnitude in favor of ty1-copia , suggesting that ty1-copia is more successful in populating eleocharis genomes than ty3-gypsy. in addition, the density of ty1-copia increases with evolutionarily younger taxa on the tree, whereas the density of ty3-gypsy remains unchanged  or slightly decreases  . this pattern might be explained by the higher amplification rate of ty1-copia  in recently diverged species. if ty3-gypsy remains inactive or nearly inactive while ty1-copia proliferates, the density of ty3-gypsy should be decreasing. a higher activity of ty3-gypsy in basal taxa might be another reason for the resulting pattern. a phylogenetic analysis of ty3-gypsy reverse transcriptase sequences revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig>  sequences from e. quinqueflora formed a well-supported species-specific clade . species-specific and strongly supported  clades of ty3-gypsy with at least five sequences were also detected in e. cellulosa, e. interstincta and e. ovata . the presence of species-specific clades suggests that these species underwent a burst of ty3-gypsy amplification after diverging from their common ancestor. it is also possible that ty3-gypsy is more efficiently removed from eleocharis genomes than ty1-copia. however, the preferential removal of an entire retrotransposon superfamily is unlikely.

the increased ty1-copia density in eleocharis is accompanied by an increase in c/n . the phylogenetic relationship between c/n and ty1-copia density is significant , implying that the larger c/n-values in recently diverged species resulted from an amplification of ty1-copia elements. this correlation is particularly apparent in species from the subseries eleocharis, in which the doubling of c/n is mirrored by a doubling of ty1-copia densities as indicated by dot blot analysis .

our observations suggest that the activities of the ty1-copia superfamily have a causal relationship with the c/n-value variation observed in the genus eleocharis. the obtained ty1-copia sequences  were analyzed for the presence of putative predominant families, under the expectation that predominant families in host genomes will also be overrepresented in amplicons, resulting in a higher probability of being cloned and sequenced   <cit> . the largest identified ty1-copia family accounted for  <dig> out of  <dig>  sequences of high nucleotide similarity  and shared highly specific amino acid motifs . because we did not find any similarity to previously described ty1-copia families, this family was named helos <dig> . helos <dig> was found in  <dig> out of  <dig> analyzed species , indicating an ancestral origin for helos <dig>  as a potential candidate involved in genome size variation in the genus eleocharis, the density of helos <dig> was also quantified. the highest densities of helos <dig> were observed in species at the top of the tree , and helos <dig> density was significantly correlated with c/n . this pattern was also observed for ty1-copia as a whole, suggesting that the higher densities of ty1-copia found in evolutionarily younger species were caused, at least in part, by helos <dig> activity .

helos <dig> was recently transposed in species that diverged later in evolutionary time
retrotransposons are epigenetically silenced when they are young   <cit> . deamination of methylated cytosines leads to higher rates of transitions to thymines and elevated transition:transversion  ratios. hence, recently transposed families/subfamilies should exhibit higher ts:tv ratios  <cit> . therefore, we calculated the ts:tv ratio for helos <dig> in the analyzed species. we observed an increasing ts:tv ratio for helos <dig> in recently diverged species, with the lowest value found in e. quinqueflora  and the highest value found in e. mamillata . we also detected a positive correlation between independent phylogenetic contrasts  <cit>  of ts:tv ratio and helos <dig> density . this finding suggests that the higher density of helos <dig> in more recently diverging species is due to its recent amplification.

CONCLUSIONS
as indicated by the positive correlation between genome size and chromosome number, our results confirm previous assumptions  <cit>  that polyploidy occurs in the genus eleocharis. however, the small genome sizes and high chromosome counts observed in our study indicate that agmatoploidy is the most important process determining chromosome number in the subgenera limnochloa and zinserlingia.

to our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ltr retrotransposons in plants with holokinetic chromosomes. our data strongly suggest that ty1-copia/helos <dig> played an important role in the evolution of both genome size and karyotype in the genus eleocharis, especially in the type subseries. in addition, the occurrence of both polyploidy events and ty1-copia/helos <dig> amplification is correlated with genome size in the phylogeny of the genus eleocharis . this relationship might help to explain why the evolutionarily youngest clade, subseries eleocharis , occurs almost exclusively in temperate and boreal climatic zones, whereas the majority of genus diversity is located in tropical and subtropical zones  <cit> .

as transposable elements, ltr retrotransposons have the strong potential to generate genic and genomic variation on which natural selection can act to create new species  <cit> . although large genome rearrangements and/or te insertions into genic regions are usually deleterious rather than beneficial, te-induced mutations and alterations need not be adaptive to facilitate speciation. according to the epi-transposon hypothesis recently proposed by zeh et al.  <cit> , the non-adaptive impacts of te activity can displace the population from its adaptive peak on the fitness landscape. subsequently, a new peak is reached by natural selection, favoring beneficial non-transposon mutations  <cit> . because species from the subseries eleocharis are polyploid , they carry duplicate or multiple copies of all genes, and thus, the negative consequences of te activity can be balanced  <cit> . a greater number of tes within a genome increases the potential to produce fecund lineages with strong abilities to evolve and adapt to various conditions  <cit> . a relationship between the latitude and activity of the mariner transposable element has already been observed in populations of drosophila simulans  <cit> . the authors of that study discussed the possibility that the invasion of new stressful habitats triggered the activity of mariner, which subsequently produced variation for natural selection. the occurrence of polyploidy has also been shown to be positively correlated with latitude in angiosperms  <cit> . it is possible that the widespread distribution and species richness of the subseries eleocharis in temperate zones  <cit>  was enhanced by transposable elements, which have larger operational genomic ranges for creating variation for natural selection and subsequent radiation in polyploids.

the above hypothesis remains to be tested. full-length retrotransposons should be isolated and the position of their insertions within eleocharis genomes should be determined. we believe that eleocharis is a promising model for studying te dynamics and genome evolution in a holokinetic system. the close taxonomical relationship between cyperaceae and poaceae could make these studies easier, as has been shown for the species luzula nivea from the sister family juncaceae  <cit> .
