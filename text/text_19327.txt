BACKGROUND
vertebrate skeleton is a multifunctional organ providing protection for soft tissues, structural support for muscle and connective tissues, storage for calcium and phosphorus, and a site for haematopoietic cell production and b lymphocyte maturation in adults  <cit> . skeletogenesis, i.e. skeleton formation during development, is a process involving complex cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with ossification and bone remodeling. both processes are known to be responsible for maintaining bone mass and skeletal integrity throughout life  <cit> . skeletogenesis requires concerted interplay between various cellular activities  and numerous molecular determinants . although human and mouse genetics have greatly contributed to unveil the mechanisms involved in skeletogenesis, information remains often insufficient for the successful development of therapies targeting skeletal diseases. recent studies, reviewed by mcgonnell and fowkes  <cit> , have demonstrated the suitability of fish models to investigate vertebrate development and in particular skeletogenesis. the resemblance of biochemical and physiological processes from fish to mammals, the presence in fish of orthologs for most mammalian genes, the similarities in organ morphology and systems composition are among the traits that contributed to the recent and rapid interest in fish models. those combined with technical advantages, e.g. large progeny, external reproduction fast growth and translucent larvae, and the power of fish genetics, have definitively transformed fish systems as promising alternatives to mammalian systems. in fact, various fish mutants have already been used to model human skeletal diseases: osteogenesis imperfecta  can be modeled by zebrafish chihuahua mutant  <cit> ; craniofacial syndromes  can be modeled by zebrafish sonic you, jellyfish, and b4galt <dig> mutants  <cit> , idiopathic scoliosis can be modeled by guppy curve back mutant  <cit>  and important efforts have consequently been made towards the development of fish biochemical, molecular, and cellular tools  <cit> . these include:  the sequence of genomes of various fish models, e.g. zebrafish, green-spotted puffer fish, japanese medaka and stickleback;  the development of large collections of expressed sequence tags  which were produced for several fish species ;  the development of several microarray platforms to explore these est collections ; and  the development of several fish-derived cell lines . to investigate mechanisms of tissue mineralization, various bone-derived cell lines of fish origin are available  <cit>  and gilthead seabream vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cell lines  are of particular interest due to their pre-chondrocyte and pre-osteoblast phenotypes. although they are both capable of mineralizing their extracellular matrix, vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cell lines behave differently regarding their degree of mineral deposition  <cit> , levels of alkaline phosphatase activity  <cit> , expression of mineralogenic genes, e.g. matrix gla protein , osteocalcin , osteopontin , bone morphogenetic protein- <dig>   <cit> , and susceptibility to mineralogenic or anti-mineralogenic molecules, e.g. insulin, igf- <dig>  vanadate  <cit>  and retinoic acid . they are therefore considered as different bone cell types and common genes differentially expressed during in vitro mineralization should represent key mineralogenic genes, while other differentially expressed genes would represent genes involved in cell type-specific processes not related to mineralization. in this work, we have used an agilent sureprint  <dig> × 44k oligo-array, containing two non-overlapping probes for each of  <dig>  unique gene transcripts  <cit> , to analyze global gene expression during in vitro mineralization of these two cell lines. we have also identified in vsa <dig> cell line the presence of mineralogenic genes whose expression was altered upon cell exposure to vanadate, a molecule with anti-mineralogenic activity  <cit> .

RESULTS
genes differentially expressed during in vitro mineralization of gilthead seabream vertebra-derived cell lines
confluent cultures of vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cells were cultivated during  <dig> weeks under control  or mineralizing  conditions. deposition of mineral nodules within extracellular matrix was confirmed by von kossa staining in cells exposed to mineralization cocktail  and total rna was extracted from three biological replicates per condition. after proper amplification and labeling, each rna sample was hybridized against the oligo-array and raw expression data were extracted and filtered using agilent feature extraction  <dig> . <dig> software, then normalized. quantile normalization showed the highest agreement among replicates  and was consequently used to normalize raw data sets. normalized data sets were analyzed through significance analysis of microarray  and genes differentially expressed in control versus mineralizing conditions were identified. false discovery rate  threshold was set at 5% and only probes with fold change  over  <dig>  were considered. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  probes - corresponding to  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique genes - indicative of an up-regulated expression were identified from vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> rnas, respectively. among these genes,  <dig>  were shown to be common to both cell lines . similarly,  <dig>  and  <dig>  probes - corresponding to  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique genes - indicative of a down-regulated expression were identified from vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> rnas, respectively. among these genes,  <dig> were shown to be common to both cell lines . in vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cells, 69% and 49% of differentially expressed genes were simultaneously detected by two non-overlapping probes, respectively, which could indicate the high occurrence of alternative splicing. it could also be the consequence of slight differences of hybridization between the two probes. indeed, most genes detected by only one probe seem to follow the same pattern of expression when compared to the second non-significant probe. raw and normalized fluorescence data have been deposited in the geo database under accession numbers gse <dig>  and gse <dig> .

ontology of mineralization-related genes
genes differentially expressed during in vitro mineralization were classified according to their putative gene ontology  - biological process , molecular function  and cellular component  - using obo-edit software, amigo database  <cit>  and sapd database  <cit> , based on significant similarity with known genes in public data bases. in general, a go term could be associated with less than 25% of mineralization-related genes . comparative analysis of go classifications indicated that the same type of genes, but not necessary the same genes, were involved in extracellular matrix  mineralization of both cell lines . moreover, similar occurrence of bp, mf and cp classes was observed in genes common to both cell lines . the most represented bp classes  were:  metabolism ,  establishment of localization ,  cellular processes  and  regulation . most mf classes were related to binding activity  and catalytic activity  . a smaller part was involved in transport, enzyme regulation and molecular transduction activities . finally, most cp classes were related to cytosol or membrane compartments  and to specific organelles . a smaller fraction was associated to macromolecular complexes , extracellular region  and organelle parts . in a general manner, the identification of numerous and diverse genes in both cell lines suggested that ecm mineralization is a complex process that requires tight regulatory mechanisms. in order to understand which type of differentially expressed genes were enriched in these cell lines, we performed a functional annotation analysis using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  and focused on processes with fold enrichment >  <dig>  and significance p-value <  <dig> . in both cell lines, results indicated an enrichment of genes associated with biosynthetic processes, cell cycle and growth, signaling, protein synthesis, stress response, biological regulation and metabolism . other processes such as protein interaction, dna/rna metabolism, development, adhesion and bone, were cell type-specific , confirming that although both cell lines are mineralogenic, they also represent different bone cell types.

functional annotation tool from the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  has been used to identify significant biological processes among differentially expressed genes. p <  <dig>   and fold enrichment  was higher than  <dig> .

in an attempt to pinpoint the most relevant mineralogenic genes, we looked at genes with a fc >  <dig> . a total of 46/ <dig> up-regulated and 49/ <dig> down-regulated genes were identified in vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cells, respectively. most of them  did not match any known gene . of these genes,  <dig> were common to both cell lines, go analysis indicated that up-regulated genes were mainly associated with  transport,  matrix/membrane,  metabolism and  signaling, while down-regulated genes were mainly associated with  metabolism,  calcium binding,  transport and  signaling.

proliferative and anti-mineralogenic effects of vanadate: identification of genes with significant patterns of expression
in order to further investigate genes involved in ecm mineralization, we exposed dividing and mineralizing vsa <dig> cells to vanadate, an ultra-trace metal with anti-mineralogenic effect in fish vertebra-derived cell lines, and analyzed global gene expression. any gene differentially expressed upon vanadate treatments would be potentially important for differentiation/mineralization mechanisms. as expected from previous studies  <cit> , cell proliferation was stimulated by vanadate at concentrations up to  <dig>  μm, while ecm mineralization was inhibited by vanadate at concentrations up to  <dig> μm . total rna was collected from three biological replicates of proliferating and mineralizing vsa <dig> cells exposed to vanadate or left untreated. after proper amplification and labeling, each rna sample was hybridized against gilthead seabream oligo-array and data were extracted, normalized, and analyzed as previously described. differentially expressed genes were identified through a two-class sam analysis with fdr < 5% and fc >  <dig>  in the following data sets: i) control versus mineralization:  <dig>  differentially expressed genes , ii) mineralization versus mineralization + vanadate:  <dig>  differentially expressed genes , and iii) proliferation versus proliferation + vanadate:  <dig>  differentially expressed genes . among those genes,  <dig> were common to conditions i) and ii) . in order to identify key mineralogenic genes in vsa <dig> cells, we looked at genes which expression was oppositely regulated during in vitro mineralization and upon vanadate treatment. these genes and their respective go categories are listed in table  <dig> and could be classified according to a score calculated as the ratio between fcm  and fcmv . most genes were shown to be associated with metabolism, cell matrix/adhesion, signaling and calcium binding. fewer genes were associated with apoptosis, transport, proteolysis, structural activity, translation and growth.

genes were selected according to their patterns of expression  and highest scores . go classification was subdivided in biological processes  and molecular function . two-class sam test were performed with fdr and fc limits lower than 5% and higher than  <dig> .

finally, proliferative and anti-mineralogenic effects of vanadate suggest that its mechanism of action may be associated with cell differentiation. therefore, genes that followed i) opposite expression between mineralization and mineralization upon vanadate treatment and ii) concordant expression between vanadate treatments during proliferation and vanadate treatments during mineralization should be of particular interest. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed when comparing data sets of dividing and mineralizing cell cultures exposed to vanadate. among those genes,  <dig> genes were also differentially expressed during in vitro mineralization without vanadate  and genes that fit into the pattern of expression described above were associated to their respective go categories and listed in table  <dig> according to highest fc values. most genes were associated with metabolism, signaling and cell matrix adhesion. fewer genes were related to proteolysis, calcium binding, cell cycle and dna replication.

genes were selected according to their patterns of expression . go classification was subdivided in biological processes  and molecular function . two-class sam test were performed with fdr and fc limits lower than 5% and higher than  <dig> .

validation of microarray data by quantitative real-time pcr analysis of gene expression
twelve genes differentially expressed during in vitro mineralization as for microarray data  were selected for validation by quantitative real-time pcr  according to the following criteria: two genes with fc >  <dig>  two genes with  <dig> > fc >  <dig>  and two genes with  <dig> > fc >  <dig>  for each cell line. comparative analysis of microarray and qpcr expression data is presented in figure  <dig>  analysis of pearson correlation revealed coefficients higher than  <dig>  for both cell lines  when comparing data from microarray probes  <dig> and  <dig>  and coefficients between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for vsa <dig> cells  and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for vsa <dig> cells  when comparing data from microarray and qpcr. the individual analysis of each gene revealed that fc measured by qpcr were always higher  than that measured by microarray , suggesting a higher sensitivity of qpcr analysis.

similarly,  <dig> genes differentially expressed in mineralizing cells exposed to vanadate  were selected for validation of microarray data by qpcr . analysis of pearson correlation revealed coefficients higher than  <dig>   when comparing data from microarray probes  <dig> and  <dig>  and higher than  <dig>   when comparing data from microarray and qpcr. in general, correlation coefficients were shown to be higher among genes analyzed in vanadate-treated vsa <dig> cells than among those analyzed in mineralizing vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cells. this difference could in part be explained by the lower fc values observed among genes identified in vanadate-treated cells and consequent lower tendency for fc compression of oligo-array data.

discussion
gilthead seabream oligo-array is a suitable tool to analyze global gene expression of mineralogenic gilthead seabream cell lines
in the present study, a comprehensive set of data has been produced following hybridization of an agilent 4x44k oligo-array with rna samples prepared from control, mineralizing and vanadate-treated gilthead seabream vertebra-derived cell samples. a two-class sam analysis identified mineralogenic genes, some of which had already been previously investigated during in vitro mineralization of vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cells through a candidate gene approach, e.g. tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase , bmp- <dig>  <cit> , spp <dig>  <cit> , mgp and oc  <cit> . at first glance, a good correlation  between microarray and pre-existing data was observed. this good correlation was later confirmed through qpcr analysis, although a tendency for fc value compression of oligo-array data was also noted. a similar fold-change compression was observed by wang et al. while validating two commercial long-oligonucleotide microarray platforms, applied biosystems and agilent, through large scale qpcr analysis of gene expression  <cit> , and more recently by ferraresso and colleagues while using agilent gilthead seabream oligo-array  <cit> . although our microarray data exhibited a dynamic range inferior to that of qpcr data, a situation which was somehow expected, they were generally accurate; agilent seabream oligo-array therefore represent a valuable tool for simultaneous analysis of the expression of thousands of genes.

in vitro mineralization recruits similar genes in fish and in mammalian bone-derived systems
putative mineralogenic genes, i.e. those differentially expressed during in vitro mineralization of vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cells, presented a similar distribution into go categories. approximately half of those genes were shown to be common to vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> cells, indicating that both cell lines, although representing different cell types, recruit similar genes and processes during mineralization. some biological processes were however differentially enriched in both cell lines. in particular, genes related to go categories bone mineralization, biomineral formation, remodeling, ossification and skeletal development were enriched in mineralizing vsa <dig> pre-osteoblast cells, and not in mineralizing vsa <dig> pre-chondrocyte cells. another goal of this study was to investigate the conservation of mineralization mechanisms throughout evolution by comparing pattern of gene expression in fish and mammalian bone-derived cell lines. global analysis of gene expression of atdc <dig> cells - mouse pre-chondrocytes similar to vsa <dig> cells - and mc3t3-e <dig> cells - mouse pre-osteoblasts similar to vsa <dig> cells - identified mineralogenic genes associated with catalysis, signal transduction, transport, transcription, structure and motor activity  <cit>  and metabolism, cell cycle, signaling, extracellular matrix, immune response and transcription  <cit> , respectively. similarity in patterns of gene expression of mammalian and fish pre-chondrocyte and pre-osteoblast cell lines, suggested that mechanisms of tissue mineralization might be conserved among vertebrates but also among mineralogenic cell types.

anti-mineralogenic activity of vanadate as a way to identify key/novel genes involved in mineralization
although most of the genes identified in the first step of this analysis certainly play a role during in vitro mineralization, some of them must be more important than others. these key genes were identified from the initial bulk of genes by using the anti-mineralogenic activity of vanadate  <cit> . indeed, those genes which expression levels were oppositely regulated during in vitro mineralization and upon treatment with vanadate were considered as good candidates. vanadate stimulates proliferation of vsa <dig> cells and strongly inhibits its ecm mineralization, and these processes seem to involve mapk and putative pi-3k\ras\erk pathways  <cit> . genes differentially expressed under these conditions could represent new candidate genes crucial for bone formation. moreover, vanadium compounds have long been known for their insulin-like properties  <cit>  and role in bone formation  <cit>  but to the best of our knowledge, their effects on gene expression have never been investigated, in particular in relation to bone. david functional annotation tool for kegg pathways identified genes in vanadate-treated vsa <dig> cells associated with insulin signaling pathway: 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase- <dig> in proliferating cells and ras homolog gene family  in differentiating cells. the involvement of signaling pathways related to insulin activity is consistent with insulin-mimetic properties of vanadium compounds  <cit>  and recent studies showing that mechanisms of action of vanadate and insulin are similar in fish vsa <dig> cells and that both molecules exhibit an anti-mineralogenic activity  <cit> . among the genes oppositely regulated during in vitro mineralization and upon treatment with vanadate , two have been associated to extracellular matrix and previously shown to play an important role in ecm structure: tenascin  and thrombospondin . both have been associated to fracture healing, spinal curvature and craniofacial defects in knock-out mice  <cit> . rap1b, intermediate of mapk , adp-ribosylation factor  <dig>  gtp-binding and effector of phospholipase d signaling, and cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunit  <dig>  a ras effector protein, were also among the genes listed in table  <dig>  identification of mapk and ras intermediate genes further demonstrates the strong involvement of mapk pathway in the ecm mineralization of bone-derived cells, as recently demonstrated in vsa <dig>  <cit>  and atdc <dig>  <cit>  pre-chondrocyte cells. a signal peptide cub and egf-like protein  gene was of particular interest since scube family members have been associated with hh signaling  <cit> , a key pathway in bone formation  <cit> , and were recently shown to modulate/antagonize bone morphogenetic protein activity in transgenic mouse and zebrafish  <cit> . our data showed an opposite regulation of scube-like and bmp- <dig>  gene expression in mineralizing and vanadate-treated cells, suggesting that scube-like protein may play a key role in anti-mineralogenic activity of vanadate through its action on bmp- <dig> gene and/or protein. further studies should however be carried out in order to confirm this hypothesis. notably, numerous genes detected in this study were classified as unknown. absence of orthologs in other vertebrate species, high divergence of fish genes and/or low level of annotation in fish sequence databases are likely to contribute to explain this situation. in addition, the fact that numerous genes identified throughout this work have not been previously linked to bone formation, suggests that genetic mechanisms involved in ecm mineralization and bone formation, whether in mammalian or fish species, are still poorly understood.

CONCLUSIONS
global gene expression has been analyzed during ecm mineralization of gilthead seabream vertebra-derived cell lines using a recently developed oligo-array. a considerably high number of differentially expressed genes was detected, and occurrence of go categories was found to be similar in both cell lines, with approximately half of the genes common to both cell lines. when comparing occurrence of go categories in vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> with those found in mammalian systems, the similarities found suggested conservation in mineralization-associated processes across vertebrates. interestingly, enrichment for bone-related genes was observed in vsa <dig>  but not in vsa <dig>  thus reinforcing the previously described association of this cell line to osteoblast lineage. furthermore, analysis of genes differentially expressed upon exposure to vanadate, a known anti-mineralogenic molecule, has permitted the identification of key/novel mineralogenic genes, which could be classified as: i) annotated genes with known roles in bone formation , ii) annotated genes with unknown roles in bone formation  and iii) unknown transcripts. although further analyses are required for genes included in the last two categories, the large number of transcripts detected in this study should bring new insights into the process of mineralization.
