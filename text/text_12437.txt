BACKGROUND
development of the mammalian brain is an intricate and protracted process that initiates with neurulation in the gastrulating embryo and extends postnatally to structural and experiential maturation in the adult. this process involves a highly orchestrated and spatiotemporally restricted series of stages, involving initial neurogenesis followed by neuronal migration, differentiation, synaptogenesis, and establishment of neural connectivity . in parallel, non-neuronal programs, including gliogenesis, myelination, and angiogenesis complete the development and maturation processes . during neurogenesis, an initial pool of primary neural stem cells , corresponding to neural tube-derived neuroepithelial cells, undergoes a gradual switch from symmetrical autoreplicative divisions to asymmetrical neurogenic divisions to produce a progressively restricted set of neural progenitors that, in turn, specify the final complement of neuronal subtypes and macroglia that populate individual brain structures  <cit> . an appropriate balance between symmetric  and asymmetric  cell divisions is critical to ensure maintenance of an adequate pool of founder progenitors as well as the proper number and distribution of their more fate-restricted derivatives, all of which contribute to the final neuronal output. the choice between self-renewal and differentiation is largely determined by programmed gene expression changes, many at the transcriptional level, in response to signals propagated by autocrine, paracrine, and exocrine soluble factors, as well as cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions . accordingly, genetic or environmental perturbations that disrupt physiologic transcription controls can alter nsc fate leading to neurodevelopmental defects.

in metazoans, signal-dependent developmental regulation of rna polymerase ii  transcription requires mediator, a conserved multi-subunit signal processor through which regulatory information conveyed by gene-specific transcription factors is transduced to pol ii. functionally, mediator acts to control and coordinate multiple steps in the transcription process, including pre-initiation complex  formation through chromatin reconfiguration and pol ii recruitment, early initiation events linked to pol ii promoter escape, pol ii pausing and elongation, and co-transcriptional rna processing . structurally, mediator is assembled from multiple constituent subunits  arranged into  <dig> distinct modules, including “head”, “middle”, “tail”, and a dissociable 4-subunit “kinase” module comprising med <dig>  med <dig>  cyclin c , and cdk <dig>  . within the kinase module, med <dig> is a critical transducer of regulatory information conveyed by signal-activated transcription factors linked to diverse pathways critical for proper brain development and function, including the sonic hedgehog, wnt, notch, and egf pathways, among others . notably, med <dig> is an obligate activator of cycc-dependent cdk8/ <dig> in mediator, and med12-mediated signaling can therefore occur in a manner dependent or independent of cdk8/ <dig> .

because of its critical role as an endpoint in key developmental signaling pathways, med <dig> is broadly implicated in vertebrate neural development. in zebrafish, med <dig> has been shown to be required for proper development of the brain and neural crest where it plays an essential role in the production of monoaminergic neurons and cranial sensory ganglia through selective regulation of neuronal-specific gene expression . more recently, med <dig> was shown to be required for hindbrain boundary formation and a notable reduction of cell proliferation was found in the hindbrain of med <dig> mutant zebrafish  <cit> . studies in hypomorphic med <dig> mutant mouse embryos revealed that med <dig> is essential for early mouse development and required for neural tube closure and axis elongation, which is likely to be caused by the disruption of the wnt/β-catenin and wnt/planar cell polarity  signaling  <cit> . finally, in humans, genetic variation in med <dig> is associated with cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. for example, polymorphisms in the med <dig> c-terminus have been linked with neuropsychiatric illness, including schizophrenia and psychosis . furthermore, missense mutations in med <dig>  located on xq <dig>  have been shown to be causative for a growing number of x-linked intellectual disability  disorders, including fg , lujan-fryns , and ohdo  syndromes . recent molecular genetic and biochemical studies have uncovered key developmental signaling pathways dysregulated as a consequence of these pathogenic mutations in med <dig>  suggesting possible bases to explain at least some of the clinical phenotypes associated with these developmental disorders. in this regard, med <dig> mutations linked with fg, lujan and ohdo syndrome have all been shown to disrupt epigenetic repression of neuronal gene expression imposed by the re <dig> silencing transcription factor/neural restrictive silencer factor , a master regulator of neuronal fate  <cit> . furthermore, med <dig> mutations linked with fg and lujan syndromes were shown to disrupt a mediator imposed constraint on gli3-dependent shh signaling  <cit> . nonetheless, a more complete description of med <dig> function in the developing nervous system, including the specific biological networks and cellular processes under its regulatory influence, remains to be firmly established. with this goal in mind, we herein combined targeted med <dig> depletion with global transcriptome profiling in mouse nscs . these studies reveal a functionally bipartite role for med <dig> in the concurrent suppression and activation of gene expression programs dedicated to cell adhesion and g1/s phase cell cycle progression, respectively, thus revealing an unexpected role for med <dig> in the enforcement of two genetic programs critical to maintenance of the nsc state.

RESULTS
med <dig> regulates nsc gene expression programs linked to adhesion and cell cycle progression
to investigate the global contribution of med <dig> to nsc biology, we profiled the transcriptomes of mouse ns- <dig>  nscs following rnai-mediated med <dig> depletion. the mns- <dig> cell line is a clonal embryonic stem  cell-derived adherent neural stem cell line that is self-renewing, genetically stable, and multipotent with the capacity to differentiate into neurons and glia both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . mns- <dig> nscs were employed for transcriptome profiling in an effort to facilitate identification of target genes likely to mediate the function of med <dig> in neural development. to this end, parallel cultures of mns- <dig> nscs were infected with lentiviruses expressing either non-silencing control or med12-specific shrnas. we validated efficient med <dig> knockdown  at both the mrna and protein levels by rt-qpcr and immunoblot analyses, respectively . biotin-labeled crna probes synthesized from control and med <dig> knockdown cells  were hybridized onto illumina mousewg- <dig> beadchip microarrays containing  <dig>  unique transcript probes corresponding to > <dig>  mouse genes. genes with a false discovery rate -adjusted p-value of p ≤  <dig>  and fold change ≥ <dig> were considered differentially expressed upon med <dig> depletion.

using these criteria, a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed upon med <dig> depletion in mns- <dig> nscs ;  <dig> genes  were upregulated, while  <dig> genes  were downregulated. to validate primary data derived from microarray analysis, we profiled the expression levels of  <dig> randomly selected genes  using the same rna samples subjected to microarray analysis as well as rna from an independent set of knockdown experiments . the results of this analysis were fully concordant with the microarray data regarding the direction and extent of regulation for each gene.

to gain insight concerning the possible biological functions of med <dig> in nscs, we subjected the list of genes differentially expressed in med <dig> knockdown cells to ingenuity® pathway analysis . the most prominent molecular networks and cellular functions to emerge from this analysis included “cell-to-cell signaling and interaction”, “gene expression”, and “cell cycle” . in addition, these genes are prominently linked to “cancer” and “genetic disorders”  , consistent with the established roles of med <dig> as a both cancer driver and a xlid gene . while the generic association between med <dig> and “gene expression” revealed by ipa is fully consistent with the well-characterized role of med <dig> as a coregulator of signal-controlled transcription factors, the association of med <dig> with “cell-to-cell interaction” and “cell cycle” networks, two genetic programs critical to the nsc phenotype, was unexpected. we therefore sought to explore the involvement of med <dig> in these two cellular processes.table  <dig> top networks and biological functions of med <dig> regulated genes in mnsc

ingenuity® pathway analysis  was used to analyze microarray data to gain insight of putative function of med <dig> in mnsc. the significance of representation  is determined by ipa based on the number of genes found in each biological category divided by the number of known genes assigned to that category by the ingenuity® knowledge base



med <dig> suppresses nsc adhesion by repressing the expression of cell adhesion molecules
among med12-regulated genes linked by ipa to the “cell-to-cell interaction” network, most were upregulated following med <dig> knockdown, suggesting that med <dig> might normally function to suppress a gene expression program dedicated to nsc interaction and adhesion . to investigate this possibility, we monitored the impact of med <dig> knockdown on the adhesive properties of mns- <dig> nscs as well as the expression levels of network genes considered likely to be direct effectors of cell adhesion, including the extracellular matrix  and/or cell membrane protein-encoding genes laminin alpha  <dig> , laminin gamma  <dig> , secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein , syndecan  <dig> , and integrin beta  <dig> . to distinguish between cdk8-dependent and cdk8-independent functions for med <dig> in the possible regulation of cell adhesion, we additionally monitored the impact of cdk <dig> knockdown on mns- <dig> nsc adhesion and gene expression. to this end, mns- <dig> nscs infected with lentiviruses expressing control, med12-, or cdk8-specific shrnas were comparatively evaluated using a quantitative flourometric-based cell adhesion assay . we validated efficient depletion of med <dig> and cdk <dig> proteins in these experiments by immunoblot analysis of virally infected cell extracts . compared to control knockdown, med <dig> knockdown enhanced mns- <dig> cell adhesion by approximately  <dig>  fold . by contrast, cdk <dig> knockdown had no measurable impact on mns- <dig> cell adhesion . as expected, we confirmed enhanced expression of cell adhesion genes  upon med <dig> depletion, while cdk <dig> knockdown was without effect . these results validate both microarray and ipa analyses and, more importantly, implicate med <dig> in the regulation of nsc adhesion, likely through cdk8-independent suppression of a cell adhesion gene expression program.fig.  <dig> med <dig> mediates suppression of genes involved in “cell adhesion”. functional gene interaction networks were identified by ipa®. genes are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line. the color of the node indicates up- or down- regulation ; uncolored nodes represent genes that were not identified as differentially expressed in our microarray, but have nonetheless been integrated into the computationally generated networks on the basis of the evidence stored in the ipa knowledge memory indicating a relevance to this network

fig.  <dig> med <dig> depletion enhances nsc adhesion in a manner reversible by concurrent depletion of sdc <dig>  a mns- <dig> nscs infected with lentiviruses expressing non-specific  control, med12-, or cdk8-specific shrnas were harvested and incubated with calcein-am prior to seeding onto 96-well plates. after washing, adherent cells were detected by fluorometry. the percentage of adhesion was calculated by dividing the background-subtracted fluorescence of adherent cells by the total corrected fluorescence of cells added to each well and multiplying by  <dig>  b rna from mns- <dig> nscs infected with lentiviruses expressing ns control, med12-, or cdk8-specific shrnas as indicated were used for rt-qpcr, mrna levels for each gene were normalized to β-actin mrna and expressed relative to their corresponding mrna levels in ns control shrna-expressing cells. c mns- <dig> nscs co-infected with lentiviruses expressing shrnas specific for med <dig> or the indicated cell adhesion genes were assayed for cell adhesion as described in . 7all data represent the mean +/− sem of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. p values were calculated by student’s t test



to confirm this possibility, we asked whether enhanced mns- <dig> cell adhesion observed upon med <dig> depletion could be functionally reversed by concurrent depletion of cell adhesion molecules regulated by med <dig>  accordingly, mns- <dig> cells were co-infected with lentiviruses expressing control or med12-specific shrnas along with individual lentiviruses expressing shrnas specific for either itgb <dig> or sdc <dig> prior to harvest and assay for cell adhesion. strikingly, concomitant depletion of both sdc <dig> and med <dig> effectively reversed enhanced cell adhesion triggered by med <dig> knockdown alone, thus confirming that med <dig> regulates nsc adhesive properties by suppression of cell adhesion genes .

mns- <dig> nscs are multipotent adherent neural stem cells capable of self-renewal in the presence of growth factors, including egf and fgf- <dig>  and growth on gelatin. this cell line can be directed to differentiate along the neuronal lineage by sequential removal of growth factors as well as a change in substratum from gelatin to laminin that reflects the involvement of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the neuronal differentiation process  <cit> . we sought to determine whether med12-imposed suppression of cell adhesion genes in self-renewing nscs cells is subject to regulation during neuronal differentiation. to this end, we first investigated whether cell adhesion genes actively repressed by med <dig> in proliferating mns- <dig> cells undergo changes in their respective expression levels during in vitro neuronal differentiation. for this purpose, mns- <dig> cells were seeded onto laminin-coated plates and induced to differentiate along the neuronal lineage by sequential withdrawal of growth factors from the culture medium. rnas were harvested on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> following initiation of neuronal differentiation, and the expression levels of cell adhesion genes were monitored by rt-qpcr. strikingly, four out of five analyzed cell adhesion genes actively suppressed by med <dig> in proliferating mns- <dig> nscs, including sdc <dig>  itgb <dig>  sparc, and lama <dig>  were dramatically upregulated during the course of neuronal differentiation, which was confirmed by expression of the neuronal marker tuj <dig> . a minimal increase in lamc <dig> expression, while reproducibly observed during neuronal differentiation, nonetheless failed to achieve statistical significance. notably, the expression level of med <dig> itself was significantly, albeit minimally, upregulated during neuronal differentiation. this observation excludes the possibility that neurogenic expression of med12-targeted cell adhesion genes derives from extinction of med <dig> expression during differentiation, and instead indicates dynamic regulation of med12-mediated suppression. apparently, alleviation of a med12-imposed block to the expression of cell adhesion genes in self-renewing nscs is required for, or consequent to, nsc cell differentiation.fig.  <dig> expression of med12-regulated cell adhesion genes increases during neuronal differentiation of mns- <dig> nscs. mns- <dig> nscs were seeded onto laminin-coated plates prior to initiation of neuronal differentiation by sequential withdrawal of growth factors as indicated in the schematic and described in methods. rna isolated from cells on  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 11 days after initiation of neuronal differentiation was subjected to rt-qpcr. mrna levels for each gene were normalized to β-actin mrna and expressed relative to their corresponding mrna levels on day  <dig>  of the differentiation protocol. data represent the mean +/− sem of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. asterisks denote statistically significant differences in the relative mrna levels for each gene compared to their corresponding levels on d0′ 



to begin to clarify this issue, we asked whether med <dig> depletion would permit the promiscuous differentiation of nscs on a limiting  substratum otherwise non-permissive for differentiation. to this end, mns- <dig> nscs infected without  or with lentiviruses expressing control, med12-, or cdk8-specific shrnas were plated onto gelatin or laminin substrata prior to induction of neuronal differentiation by sequential withdrawal of growth factors. changes in cell morphology and adhesion were monitored during the course of differentiation by optical microscopy and calcein am-based cell adhesion assay as described previously. notably, when induced to differentiate on gelatin, med <dig> knockdown cells, compared to mock-infected or control-knockdown cells, exhibited enhanced cell adhesion  and prolonged survival, although these cell failed to complete neuronal differentiation . on the other hand, enhanced cell adhesion and survival on gelatin triggered by med <dig> knockdown was completely bypassed by induction of mns- <dig> nsc differentiation on laminin. thus, compared to mock-infected or control-knockdown cells, med12-knockdown cells exhibited no significant differences in cell morphology or adhesion . these findings suggest that reversal of a med12-mediated block to the expression of cell adhesion genes is a regulated process that may be required as a course of nsc differentiation along the neuronal lineage.fig.  <dig> med <dig> knockdown increases cell adhesion and preserves cell viability on limiting  substratum during neuronal differentiation. a-d mns- <dig> nscs infected with lentiviruses expressing ns control, med12-, or cdk8-specific shrnas were seeded into t- <dig> tissue culture flasks coated with gelatin  or laminin  prior to initiation of neuronal differentiation as described in fig.  <dig>  fluorescence based adhesion assay  was performed 40 h after initiation of the neuronal differentiation. data represent the mean +/− sem of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. p values were calculated by student’s t test. brightfield images  were obtained by optical microscopy at  <dig>   <dig>  and 7 days after initiation of neuronal differentiation. e and f validation of med <dig> and cdk <dig> depletion in knockdown cells by rt-qpcr  and immunoblot  analyses. mrna levels for each gene in  were normalized to β-actin mrna and expressed relative to their corresponding mrna levels in untreated  cells. data represent the mean +/− sem of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. p values were calculated by student’s t test



med <dig> promotes nsc proliferation through activation of g1/s phase cell cycle regulatory genes
among med12-regulated genes linked by ipa to the “cell cycle”, most were downregulated following med <dig> depletion . notably, several of these genes, including ccne <dig>  e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  jun, and egr <dig>  encode established g1/s phase cell cycle regulators, suggesting that in proliferating nscs, med <dig> might normally function to activate a gene expression program involved in g1/s phase cell cycle progression. to examine this possibility, we monitored the impact of med <dig> knockdown on the cell cycle distribution profile of proliferating mns- <dig> nscs. thus, asynchronously growing mns- <dig> nscs were infected with lentiviruses expressing control, med12-, or cdk8-specific shrnas prior to analysis of dna content by flow cytometry. this analysis revealed that depletion of med <dig>  but not cdk <dig>  significantly increased the percentage of g1-phase cells while simultaneously decreasing the percentage of s-phase cells, indicative of a g1/s phase cell cycle block . by contrast, med <dig> depletion had no significant impact on mns- <dig> apoptotic cell death . to determine if the observed g1/s phase cell cycle block accompanying med <dig> knockdown is manifest in a proliferative defect, we monitored the impact of med <dig> knockdown on mns- <dig> proliferation by viable cell counting. compared to control-knockdown cells, med12-knockdown cells exhibited a significant  reduction in cell proliferation . by contrast, knockdown of neither cdk <dig> nor med <dig>  a different subunit localized to the middle module of mediator, adversely affected cell proliferation . notably, however, knockdown of cycc recapitulated the impact of med <dig> depletion . because cycc links cdk8/ <dig> to med <dig> in the mediator kinase module, the requirement for med <dig> and cycc, but not cdk <dig>  implies a probable role for cdk <dig> in mns- <dig> nsc proliferation. as expected, we confirmed significant downregulation in these experiments of g1/s phase cell cycle regulators, including ccne <dig>  e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  and jun, following depletion of med <dig> and cycc, but not cdk <dig> or med <dig> . furthermore, by targeted small-scale gene expression profiling in mns- <dig> nscs, we identified an expanded set of apparent med12-dependent g1/s phase cell cycle regulators. thus, ccnd <dig>  e2f <dig>  ccna <dig>  and ccne <dig> were all specifically downregulated following med <dig> depletion . notably, neither p <dig> nor p <dig> expression levels were altered by med <dig> depletion, excluding dna-damage and/or restriction checkpoints as possible bases for the g1/s phase cell cycle block observed in med12-knockdown cells. instead, these findings suggest that med <dig> promotes nsc proliferation through cdk8-indpendent, but possibly cdk19-dependent, activation of a g1/s phase cell cycle regulatory gene expression program.fig.  <dig> med <dig> mediates activation of genes involved in “cell cycle control”. genes involved in cell cycle control are largely downregulated  upon med <dig> depletion in mns- <dig> nscs. functional gene interaction networks were identified by ipa® as described in fig. 1

discussion
although recent studies have begun to elaborate the involvement of med <dig> in the developing vertebrate nervous system, much less in known regarding the precise functions of this important mediator subunit at the cellular level. in an initial effort to address this knowledge gap, we herein combined med <dig> knockdown with global transcriptome profiling in mouse es cell-derived nscs. our findings reveal novel roles for med <dig> in the control of nsc adhesion and cell cycle progression, both of which are known to be fundamentally associated with stem cell maintenance. previous studies have indicated that interactions between nscs and their niche play an essential regulatory role in balancing stem cell maintenance and differentiation  <cit> . moreover, studies have suggested that ecm, a major niche component, plays a key regulatory function in nsc maintenance and differentiation by transferring environmental cues to embryonic and adult nscs . for instance, in the developing mammalian embryonic brain, loss of the adhesion molecule integrin promotes neural stem cell detachment from the ecm and ultimately apoptosis  <cit> . laminins are the best-described ecm component and laminin γ <dig> has been shown to be associated with nsc differentiation in the mouse  <cit> . in addition, studies have suggested that cell adhesion molecules may influence asymmetric stem cell division by interacting with microtubules of the mitotic spindle and directing the plane of cell division  <cit> . thus, while the contribution of cell adhesion molecules to nsc homeostasis is well established, it is less clear how these molecules are transcriptionally regulated. we found that med <dig> depletion enhanced nsc adhesion concordant with upregulation of cell adhesion genes, including those encoding ecm components, integrins, and proteoglycans. furthermore, concurrent reduction of both sdc <dig> and med <dig> was sufficient to partially reverse enhanced cell adhesion triggered by med <dig> knockdown alone, confirming that med <dig> negatively regulates nsc cell adhesion by transcriptional suppression of cell adhesion molecules. notably, we observed that cell adhesion genes suppressed by med <dig> in proliferating nscs were upregulated during directed neuronal differentiation in vitro, thus revealing med12-imposed suppression to be a dynamically regulated process. in support of this, depletion of med <dig> alone was sufficient to promote enhanced adhesion and prolonged survival of nscs induced to differentiate on a limiting  substratum otherwise nonpermissive for neuronal differentiation. by contrast, directed differentiation of nscs on a permissive  substratum completely bypassed the adhesion and survival advantage conferred by med <dig> depletion. taken together, our findings support the notion that med <dig> contributes to maintenance of the nsc state through suppression of a cell adhesion program and, furthermore, that this suppression is alleviated as a course of neuronal differentiation.

during neural development, nscs undergo symmetric and asymmetric divisions, the former to maintain an adequate founder progenitor pool and the latter to ensure an appropriate number and distribution of more fate-restricted progeny. cell fate decisions are tightly associated with the cell cycle machinery  <cit> . cell cycle progression is controlled by checkpoints at each phase of the cell cycle by a series of highly regulated events, including the alternating activities of various cyclin-dependent kinases . cdks are activated only upon binding to their corresponding cyclin and repressed by cdk inhibitors  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that down-regulation of cyclins acting at the g <dig> and s phases of the cell cycle prevents s phase entry and favors withdrawal from the cell cycle  <cit> . our findings revealed that med <dig> depletion leads to down-regulation of g1/s cell cycle regulators, triggering a g1/s phase cell cycle block and diminished nsc proliferation. although our results clearly indicate that med <dig> plays a role in nsc proliferation, it is presently unclear whether med <dig> plays a role in nsc self-renewal. in this regard, it is well established that mechanistic control of cell cycle progression is tightly linked with nsc proliferation and differentiation in the embryonic and adult nervous system  <cit> . for example, the g <dig> phase  check point, beyond which cells are irreversibly committed to replication absent external growth stimuli, represents a fundamental step in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, while g <dig> phase duration directly influences the differentiation of neural precursors . thus, med <dig> may prevent unscheduled nsc differentiation by activating g1/s phase cell cycle regulators and promoting g1/s phase cell cycle transit.

med <dig> is an obligate activator of cycc-dependent cdk <dig> in mediator, and med <dig> may therefore control gene expression in a manner dependent or independent of cdk <dig> kinase activity  <cit> . herein, we found that med <dig> regulates nsc adhesion and cell cycle regulatory genes in a cdk8-independent manner. however, this does not exclude the possibility that med12-mediated gene regulation in this setting is dependent on mediator-associated kinase activity. in fact, our observation that cycc depletion effectively recapitulates the impact of med <dig> knockdown supports a probable role for med12-dependent cdk <dig> activity in this context, since cycc physically links med <dig> with cdk8/ <dig> and cdk <dig> is functionally dispensable for med12-dependent control of mns- <dig> proliferation and cell cycle regulatory gene expression. notably, cdk <dig> is expressed in the developing nervous system, and we found that cdk <dig> is indeed expressed in mns- <dig> nscs. cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> share 91 % overall amino acid sequence identity, with a particularly high degree of sequence conservation in their respective kinase and cyclin-binding domains, but considerably more divergence in their corresponding c-termini  <cit> . these paralogous subunits assemble into mediator in a mutually exclusive manner, and recent studies have revealed that cdk8-mediator and cdk19-mediator are not functionally redundant during development  <cit> . in fact, these distinct mediator species regulate unique gene expression programs in some cellular settings . accordingly, further studies will be required to establish whether and how cdk <dig> contributes to med12-dependent regulation of cell adhesion and cell cycle regulatory genes in mns- <dig> nscs.

finally, the mechanism by which med <dig> differentially represses and activates cell adhesion and cell cycle regulatory programs remains to be fully clarified. in this regard, we and others have shown that med <dig> can function in a context-dependent manner as either a co-activator or co-repressor of gene transcription  <cit> . for example, we previously showed that med <dig> is co-activator of wnt-stimulated β-catenin; in this context, pol ii is indirectly recruited by promoter-bound lef/β-catenin through mediator, with which β-catenin interacts directly through its med <dig> interface  <cit> . by contrast, we have also shown that med <dig> is a co-repressor of rest/nrsf in neuronal gene silencing through a mechanism involving epigenetic repression. in this context, the med <dig> interface in mediator links promoter-bound rest/nrsf with g9a histone methyltransferase, a dominant euchromatic h3k <dig> dimethylase in mammalian cells  <cit> . it thus appears likely that med <dig> mediates suppression and activation of cell adhesion and cell cycle regulatory genes, respectively, through a mechanism involving differential recruitment by gene-specific regulators. in this regard, it is notable that rest/nrsf has previously been implicated in the regulation of an ecm gene expression program in mouse nscs  <cit> . however, in this context, rest/nrsf appears to be required for activation of ecm genes, and therefore functionally opposed to the role of med <dig> identified herein as a suppressor of ecm and cell adhesion genes. further studies, including those in primary brain-derived nscs, will be required to establish the precise and broader conserved regulatory mechanism by which med <dig> differentially functions to suppress and activate cell adhesion and cell cycle control programs in nscs.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our findings reveal new insight concerning the global contribution of med <dig> to nsc biology. we propose a model in which med <dig> contributes to maintenance of nsc identity by concurrent suppression and activation of gene expression programs dedicated to cell adhesion and g1/s phase cell cycle progression, respectively . in this capacity, med <dig> may contribute to the balance between nsc self-renewal and differentiation. future studies will seek to clarify the mechanistic bases by which med12/mediator integrates and transduces regulatory signals that specify its dual functionality in suppression and activation of gene expression programs that contribute to nsc fate.fig.  <dig> schematic model for the role of med <dig> in mnscs. med <dig> contributes to the maintenance of nsc identity through a functionally bipartite role in suppression and activation of gene expression programs dedicated to cell adhesion and g1/s phase cell cycle progression, respectively
