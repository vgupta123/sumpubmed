BACKGROUND
the selection of susceptibility-related genes is considered to be one of the best long-term means to improve resistance to mastitis in dairy cattle and may reduce drug use, improve milk quality and safety, and reduce economic loss
 <cit> . as a prominent mechanism for posttranscriptional regulation, alternative splicing is significant in cell development, differentiation, physiological functions and pathogenesis, and it has been reported to have many critical roles in mammalian diseases including bovine mastitis
. many studies have shown that alternative splicing is also closely related to immune function
.

pre-mrna splicing involves a large molecular complex called the spliceosome that consists of four small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles  and other non-snrnp splicing factors, such as serine/arginine rich  and u2af proteins
 <cit> . the exons of vertebrate genes are generally separated by large introns, and possess 5’ splice sites, branch points, pyrimidine tracts and 3’ splice sites which are very short conserved elements that are required for constitutive splicing
 <cit> . the splicing of alterative exons is also modulated by cis-acting elements, such as positive exon splicing enhancers  which regulate the gene splicing process by interacting with sr proteins. through binding to an ese, sr proteins can enhance u <dig> snrnp binding to a 5’ splice site resulting in a splicing reaction, and can also promote u2af recruitment to the pyrimidine tract, which leads to the activation of the adjacent 3’ splice site
 <cit> . as has previously been shown, mutations in eses result in aberrantly spliced transcripts, and may cause human diseases by affecting the encoded protein
 <cit> .

cd <dig> is a single stranded transmembrane glycoprotein which anchors to almost all nucleated cells, including granulocytes, platelets, t cells, b cells, nk cells, fibroblast cells, skin cells, endothelial cells and stellate glial cells. cd <dig> protein is composed of a region comprising four structurally related short consensus repeats , a serine, threonine and proline-rich  region, a short region of unknown function, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain  and a cytoplasmic tail . the stp region is variable, and encoded by three exons  which are commonly expressed as b + c or c isoforms. one of two non-homologous alternative cytoplasmic tails  resulting from alternative splicing contains signaling motifs which drive the differential processing of isoforms
 <cit> . cd <dig> belongs to the family of regulators of complement activation, and cleaves complement factors c3b and c4b to protect normal cells from complement-mediated damage
 <cit> . cd <dig> can also be used as a costimulatory molecule involved in t cell activation through altering cell polarity and preventing normal cell responses to antigen presentation
. there are reports which show that pathogen receptor cd <dig> on the cell surface can trigger cell autophagy to control infection by streptococcus
 <cit> . bovine mastitis is the inflammation of the mammary gland caused primarily by bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus, and escherichia coli. therefore, we speculated that the cd <dig> gene likely plays a role in the defense of dairy cattle to streptococcus induced mastitis by an alternative splicing mechanism caused by a functional mutation which causes an aberrant transcript.

we found that a snp in intron  <dig> of the bovine cd <dig> gene causes the partial retention of intron  <dig> sequences within mature cd <dig> rnas. by cloning alternative cd <dig> partial alleles into a minigene expression system which was transfected and expressed in 293 t cells, we demonstrate that this mutation disrupts an ese, and causes the production of an aberrant cd46-tv isoform. association analysis between four udder health traits of holsteins and their cd <dig> snp  genotypes suggests that this snp may be a useful functional marker for molecular breeding for mastitis-resistance in dairy cows.

RESULTS
the novel splice variant cd46-tvwas identified in mammary gland tissues
specific cd46f and cd46r primers were used to amplify the 5’ untranslated region  to the 3’ untranslated region  of the bovine cd <dig> gene  from the  <dig> pooled cdna composed of  <dig> mammary tissue samples. pcr conditions for annealing were designed using  <dig> temperature gradients between 52°c and 65°c. in addition to the expected smaller 2005 bp pcr product, a larger band was also detected by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel from the products produced at increased annealing temperatures , indicating that an aberrant splice variant might exist.figure  <dig>

to confirm the putative bovine cd <dig> splice variant, we purified and cloned the largest pcr product. a total of  <dig> clones were sequenced individually, and we identified the new splice variant, named as cd46-tv , from  <dig> clones. compared to the cd46-complete transcript, blast analysis indicated that the splice variant cd46-tv retained a 48 bp sequence from intron  <dig> .

a putative functional snp in intron  <dig> of cd46
to identify the molecular cause of the aberrant cd46-tv splice variant, primers cd46f <dig> and cd46r <dig> were designed to amplify the adjacent region of intron  <dig> . snp  was found by sequencing the pcr amplification products from dairy cow dna, and is located in the 48 bp sequence retained in the cd46-tv transcript .

esefinder  <dig>  
 <cit>  software was used to predict whether the snp affected the production of the new transcript cd46-tv. esefinder predicted the snp to be located within overlapping ese motifs for sr proteins, and that the introduction of the c. 1033 +  <dig> c > t mutation abolished two binding sites for the splicing factors srsf <dig>  and srsf <dig>  . these analyses suggest that there should be a correlation between the snp alleles and the presence or absence of the splice variant cd46-tv.figure  <dig>

the c allele of snp  is identified as the ancestral allele
genotyping indicated that the c allele was more frequent in the sample of  <dig> chinese holstein cows . to determinate which allele is the mutant, allele frequency was further investigated in diverged bovid species. interestingly, the snp  is located on the illumina bovinesnp50k beadchip , thus we extracted genotype data for this snp and estimated allele frequency in  <dig>  individuals belonging to  <dig> breeds or species including bos taurus, bos indicus, bos javanicus, bos grunniens and bos mutus . within bos taurus breeds  the frequency of the t-allele was  <dig>  to  <dig> , while the t-allele was nearly absent in  <dig> other bos species  suggesting that c is the ancestral allele and t is the mutant.table  <dig>

mutation in the putative ese generates the novel splice transcript
to determine whether the c. 1033 +  <dig> c > t nucleotide substitution in intron  <dig> leads to the abrogation of the predicted sr protein motifs and causes aberrant splicing, we respectively amplified 1421 bp genomic fragments spanning 914 bp of intron  <dig>  54 bp of exon  <dig> and 453 bp of intron  <dig> alternatively harboring the c. 1033 +  <dig> c-allele and c. 1033 + 2184 t-allele and cloned the two fragments into the pspl <dig> vector .figure  <dig>

after transfecting the two minigene plasmids into 293 t cells, mrnas were isolated at 24 h following transfection, reverse transcribed and rt-pcr was applied to detect the cd <dig> splicing pattern with vector-specific primers . the wild-type and mutant-type constructs all gave rise to a 317 bp pcr fragment, and the empty pspl <dig> control a 263 bp pcr product. however, the plasmid construct with the wild-type c. 1033 +  <dig> c-allele also yielded two length of rt-pcr product. one is a larger rt-pcr product and the other is the 317 bp pcr band . through subsequent cloning experiment, we confirmed that the size of the larger band was 365 bp.

we also genotyped sixteen chinese holstein cows including  <dig> cc,  <dig> ct and  <dig> tt genotype individuals. through rt-pcr experiment using f <dig> and r <dig> primers, the cd46-tv transcript was found to only be expressed in the mammary glands of cows possessing c allele. further, the expression level of the cd46-tv transcript was relatively higher in cows with the cc than the ct genotype .

the sr protein and ese functions in the alternative splicing of cd46
within the metazoa, almost all of the pre-mrna produced within the cell nucleus have gu bases in the 5’ splice site of adjacent introns and ag bases in the 3’ splice site, which is recognized as the gu-ag rule or chambon rule
 <cit> . to ascertain the reason for the retention of 48 bp of intron  <dig> sequence within the cd46-tv transcript, we analyzed the 48 bp sequence and the intronic splicing site bases, and found that the splicing site bases conformed with the gu-ag rule, while the c. 1033 +  <dig> c > t mutation disrupted two ese motifs recognized by the srsf <dig> and srsf <dig> proteins . we therefore infer that the presence of the snp t allele eliminates the production of the cd46-tv splice variant.figure  <dig>

expression of the cd46-tvsplice variant in cow mammary gland tissues
to understand the relationship between the cd46-tv transcript and dairy cow mastitis, the relative quantification of the transcript in mammary glands was performed by rt-qpcr from three healthy and three streptococcus infected and mastitic dairy cows with the cc genotype. the mastitis-infected tissues revealed a relatively higher cd46-tv mrna expression compared with healthy tissues , indicating that the c allele would be associated with a reduced risk of mastitis.figure  <dig>

relationship between genotypes of the snp  and milk somatic cell score, as well as gebv of stma, cel and macl of holsteins
somatic cell count is considered to be an indicator for dairy mastitis
 <cit>  and it is often converted into somatic cell score  due to the skewness of the somatic cell count distribution
 <cit> . to investigate whether the snp was associated with mastitis in dairy cows, we first used the cd46f <dig> and cd46f <dig> primers to genotype  <dig> cows by direct sequencing, and the association analysis was performed between genotype and somatic cell score in these chinese holstein cows. the results revealed that the estimated frequencies of the c and t alleles were 71% and 29%, respectively. moreover, cows with the cc and tt genotypes showed a relative higher scs than individuals with the ct genotype .

cel is the genomic breeding value of somatic cell score. macl is an index used to evaluate the occurrence of clinical mastitis. gebv for stma is a combination of somatic cell score and clinical mastitis . a high breeding value means a high occurrence of mastitis. in experiment four, to investigate whether this snp was associated with mastitis in holsteins, we analyzed the association between genotypes and mastitis-related traits in  <dig> chinese holsteins with gebvs. the estimated frequencies of the c- and t-alleles were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. moreover, cows with the cc and tt genotypes showed a relative higher stma and cel than individuals with the ct genotype . the result suggests that there is some kind of heterozygote advantage although the mechanism by which this occurs is really not clear. moreover, the gebv of macl of the holstein with the cc or ct genotypes was significantly lower than for the tt genotype . these results suggest that the cc and ct genotypes are advantageous for bovine mastitis resistance and we conclude that the c. 1033 +  <dig> c > t mutation affects cow mastitis-resistance.table  <dig>

discussion
in this study, a new cd <dig> transcript variant named cd46-tv was identified following the cloning of cd <dig> mrna. by sequencing, we identified the snp  within the retained 48 bp intron  <dig> sequence of cd <dig>  using the esefinder  <dig>  bioinformatics tool, we predicted that this snp was located within an exonic splice enhancer  motif, and that the derived t-allele eliminated two potential sr protein binding sites for the splicing factors srsf <dig> and srsf <dig>  the sr proteins are highly conserved in metazoans, are required for constitutive splicing and can influence the regulation of alternative splicing. sr proteins function in the recognition of eses and lead to the activation of suboptimal adjacent 5’ and 3’ splice sites
 <cit> , and the srsf <dig>  protein is responsible for the aberrant splicing of pre-mrnas when increased numbers of binding sites result in the retention of intron and exon skipping
 <cit> . it has also been reported that the over-expression of srsf <dig>  affects the alternative splicing of cd44
 <cit> . therefore, the deletion of the two splicing factors may partially affect splicing which produced a product which retains the 48 bp intronic sequence.

to verify whether the c. 1033 +  <dig> c > t mutation influenced the aberrant splicing of cd <dig>  we introduced alternative alleles into the pspl <dig> exon trapping vector and found that the pspl <dig> construct vector with the c-allele permitted the retention of the 48 bp intron  <dig> sequence while the t-allele construct did not permit this retention. alternative and constitutive splicing are closely connected and utilize the same splicing mechanism, because components of constitutive splicing are also essential for alternative splicing. moreover, alternative exons often have suboptimal splice sites or sequence elements compared with constitutive exons, and different activities or amounts of splicing factors in different cell types or developmental stages can also affect the splicing reaction
 <cit> . we analyzed the splicing position sequences producing the cd46-tv transcript, and found that the retained 48 bp sequence conformed to the conditions of an alternative exon and had the potential for alternative splicing. these results suggest that the disruption of the predicted srsf <dig> and srsf <dig> binding sites caused by the c. 1033 +  <dig> c > t mutation leads to the retention of the 48 bp intron  <dig> sequence. cd <dig> regulates complement activation by binding the c3b and c4b complement products deposited on host cell membranes and serves as a cofactor for their proteolytic inactivation by the plasma serine protease factor i. this process, which irreversibly prevents c <dig> and c <dig> convertase formation, protects host cells from lysis by autologous complementation
 <cit> . the reference cd46-complete protein and the putative cd46-tv protein share common scr1- <dig> domains containing binding sites for c3b and c4b. therefore, the two cd <dig> isoforms can play the same role in complement regulation. the mutation is predicted to increase the size of the cd <dig> protein by  <dig> amino acids. by blast analysis, we found that these  <dig> amino acids were highly conserved with the stp region of the porcine cd <dig> protein. the cd <dig> stp domain serves as a functional modulator of cd <dig> by altering complement regulatory activity
 <cit> . the stp domain is also crucial for the efficient adhesion of bacteria to host cells
 <cit> . recognition of microbial pathogens is an essential element for the initiation of innate immune responses such as inflammation. the complement regulatory protein cd <dig> is used as a cell receptor and can bind with bacteria including streptococcus pyogenes
 <cit> . therefore, cd46-tv may play an important role in resistance to mastitis caused by streptococcus.

to further demonstrate the function of cd46-tv in bovine mastitis, rt-qpcr demonstrated that cd46-tv mrna expression was significantly higher in mastitis-infected mammary tissues than in healthy tissues. autophagy is a degradative mechanism involved in cell protection against invading pathogens. cd <dig> can play a primary function in the host’s response to pathogens by regulating complement activation, and can also play an important role in cd46-dependent autophagy, which is induced as an innate immune mechanism and is a critical step in the early control of infection
 <cit> .

several studies have investigated snp associations with mastitis traits by genome-wide association studies in various cattle populations. most of the reports highlighted the most significant snps and results of studies have differed. many snps on different chromosomes  have reached genome-wide significance for association with mastitis-related traits using the illumina bovinesnp <dig> and bovinehd beadchips
. several snps with significant associations with clinical mastitis all lactations, somatic cell score and clinical mastitis first lactation were found on bta <dig> , however, detailed snp information was not provided
 <cit> . no specific evidence revealed association signals in the vicinity of cd <dig> on bta <dig> were identified in these studies. this suggests that there may be larger effect mutations on mastitis susceptibility than the mutation which produces the cd46-tv transcript.

recent evidence suggests that snps are major contributors to the generation of alternative splice variants, which can cause serious human and cow diseases
 <cit> . to test whether the c. 1033 +  <dig> c > t snp identified in this study plays an important role in dairy cow mastitis, an association analysis between genotypes and gebvs of stma, cel and macl showed that the holsteins with the ct and cc genotypes were more resistant to mastitis because individuals with the tt genotype have a higher percentage of occurrence of clinical mastitis. based on the results of the snp causing the cd46-tv splice variant and the association analysis between genotype and gebvs of mammary gland health traits in chinese holstein population, we predicted that cd46-tv protein caused by the snp was very likely to have a significant role in bovine mastitis-resistance. this result requires further confirmation in a larger reference population.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a causative mutation in an exonic splice enhancer of the bovine cd <dig> gene which causes the elimination of the cd46-tv splice variant. bioinformatic prediction, relative expression and association analysis between genotype and mammary gland health traits suggest that the splice variant may be involved in resistance to mastitis caused by streptococcus in dairy cows.
