BACKGROUND
cytokines and chemokines are important in immune cell recruitment and in regulation of inflammatory responses  <cit> . t-cells produce a broad range of inflammatory mediators, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf and cxcl <dig>  all of which are important in cell proliferation, differentiation, communication and initiation of inflammatory responses  <cit> . elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as tnf, il- <dig> and cxcl <dig>  are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis  <cit> , pulmonary fibrosis  <cit>  and aids  <cit> . induction of cxcl <dig> has been suggested to be mediated through nf-κb in cooperation with ap- <dig>  <cit> , however the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, and treatment strategies aimed at inhibiting cxcl <dig> have failed  <cit> . persistent production of il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> leads to chronic inflammation and enhanced survival of lymphocytes increasing serum cytokine/chemokine levels. this forms the basis of several autoimmune disorders including plasmacytosis and hyperplasia  <cit> . to develop viable cxcl <dig> based treatment strategies, it is necessary to identify the signalling pathways regulating cxcl <dig> and determine how this is coupled to nf-κb, ap- <dig> and il- <dig> 

the signalling pathways leading to nf-κb and ap- <dig> activation are overlapping, where both are involved in the induction and regulation of cytokines/chemokines. nf-κb is activated in response to stress, such as oxidative stress, bacterial toxins, viruses and uv light  <cit> , and is essential for differentiation, proliferation and survival of many cell types including t-lymphocytes  <cit> . ap- <dig> activation requires fos  and jun  through the formation of homo- and hetero-dimers  <cit> , and regulates transcription of a broad range of genes involved in immune responses  <cit> . both ap- <dig> and nf-κb binding sites have been identified in the promoter region of il- <dig> and cxcl <dig>  <cit> , however, the mechanism by which these interleukins are regulated in t-cells is still not clear. cxcl <dig> is a c-x-c chemokine with properties enabling it to recruit t-cells and basophils and to activate neutrophils and monocytes  <cit> . il- <dig> is a cytokine that possesses both pro- and anti-inflammatory characteristics and that plays a key role in haematopoiesis and acute-phase responses  <cit> .

the present study suggests that the regulation of cxcl <dig> and il- <dig> is uncoupled. using jurkat t-cells exposed to pma and heat killed  escherichia coli mg <dig> in combination with inhibitors of nf-κb, jnk and pkc, we demonstrated that nf-κb regulates il- <dig> expression while the regulation of cxcl <dig> more closely correlated to ap- <dig> activity. these results indicate that inhibition of nf-κb is not an effective strategy in countering the high cxcl <dig> activities in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, aids and pulmonary fibrosis.

RESULTS
regulation of ap- <dig> and nf-κb activation
the transcription factors nf-κb and ap- <dig> play key roles in the initiation of an inflammatory response by inducing the expression and secretion of chemokines and cytokines that attract and activate immune cells. however, the signal transduction pathways and subsequent inflammatory cytokine induction by these transcription factors is not fully elucidated. the present study is aimed at determining the involvement of ap- <dig> and nf-κb in cytokine induction and regulation. pma treatment resulted in an up-regulation of ap- <dig> after  <dig> h exposure and continued to increase throughout the analysis period . hk e. coli treatment did not affect ap- <dig> activation in jurkat t-cells . to determine the involvement of associated pathways, we exposed cells to ca2+ ionophore with or without pma and observed a modest involvement of ca2+ in pma-dependent ap- <dig> activation  while ca2+ alone did not alter ap- <dig> activity . furthermore, ap- <dig> activity decreased in a tcr-deficient jurkat cell line when exposed to pma compared to the parent cell line indicating that regulation of ap- <dig> was only partially t-cell receptor dependent .

nf-κb levels showed a transient increase at  <dig> min after exposure to pma . however,  <dig> h after exposure the nf-κb levels began to drop reaching the lowest levels by  <dig> h, after which they increased again by  <dig> h. exposure of jurkat t-cells to hk e. coli resulted in a dose-dependent nf-κb activation, with the highest activity observed at a relative concentration of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml . the time-dependent activation of nf-κb by hk e. coli was assessed further using the optimal concentration obtained from figure 2b and showed that the nf-κb activity increased after  <dig> h of exposure . furthermore, increased intracellular ca2+ reversed the pma dependent nf-κb inhibition  and reduced the hk e. coli -dependent nf-κb activation .

induction of inflammatory responses
the ability of pma and hk e. coli to induce an inflammatory response in jurkat t-cells was evaluated using a multiplex cytokine assay following  <dig> h stimulation. the cytokine profile revealed an enhanced induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf and the chemokine cxcl <dig>  the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> were unaffected by pma but were significantly decreased by hk e. coli . these results confirmed that pma and hk e. coli induced an inflammatory response in the jurkat t-cells. it is interesting to note that pma was 120-fold more effective at inducing cxcl <dig> than hk e. coli. pma-dependent induction of ap- <dig> and down-regulation of nf-κb suggests an involvement of ap- <dig> in cxcl <dig> regulation. determination of the time course of cytokine induction in response to pma showed that cxcl <dig> was already released between 2- <dig> h, while tnf and il- <dig> were released between 6- <dig> h . these results indicated that the cytokines were differentially regulated and that the release was not associated with the early transient induction of nf-κb. the temporal induction of ap- <dig> correlated to the cxcl <dig> levels and preceded the tnf and il- <dig> release. this suggests an association between cxcl <dig> release and ap- <dig> signalling.

cytokine levels were determined using multiplex assays. concentrations are given as pg/ml for each group . statistical significance from the control  was determined using student's t-test.

cooperative induction of cytokines by ap- <dig> and nf-κb
to further characterize the involvement of nf-κb in cytokine regulation, we treated cells with an nf-κb activation inhibitor . the results showed that nai selectively down-regulated nf-κb activation  and did not alter ap- <dig> activity . exposure of jurkat t-cells to nai resulted in a modest reduction of cxcl <dig> following pma exposure, while it did not alter the cxcl <dig> release following hk e. coli exposure . nai did not affect tnf expression  indicating that nf-κb is not the main regulator of cxcl <dig> or tnf following either pma or hk e. coli exposure in jurkat t-cells. in contrast, nai resulted in a complete inhibition of il- <dig> following pma exposure and a 45% inhibition following hk e. coli exposure , suggesting an involvement of nf-κb in il- <dig> regulation.

ca2+ was observed to increase ap- <dig> activity  and reduce nf-κb activity ; therefore, we exposed t-cells to a pkc inhibitor together with pma to determine its effect on cytokine expression. inhibition of pkc reduced cxcl <dig> release from  <dig> ng/ml to  <dig> ng/ml while it had a modest effect on il- <dig> and tnf . this prompted us to test the effect of jnk inhibition on pma-induced cytokine expression. jnk is involved in the regulation of a multitude of different transcription factors, including the phosphorylation and activation of c-jun, c-fos and p <dig>  leading to cellular apoptosis  <cit> . inhibition of the jnk pathways resulted in a down-regulation of both cxcl <dig> and il- <dig>  while no clear effect was observed on tnf expression . analysis of mrna levels using rt-qpcr  showed that pma induced both il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> mrna . addition of the nf-κb inhibitor nai and the jnk inhibitor reduced the il- <dig> expression below basal levels. in contrast, while the cxcl <dig> levels were suppressed by the same treatments the levels remained elevated above basal level.

gene expression was determined using rt-qpcr. the ct values were normalized against 18s. statistical significance from the positive control  was determined using student's t-test. concentrations are given as fg/ml, values are presented as mean ± sem, n =  <dig> 

nf-κb inhibition due to pkc-dependent bcl <dig> degradation
western blot analysis revealed an up-regulation of phosphorylated-pkc after  <dig> h treatment of jurkat t-cells with pma or hk e. coli , while iκbβ levels remained unaffected . bcl <dig> is a signalling protein that acts upstream of nf-κb in concert with carma <dig> and malt <dig> and has been suggested to directly regulate nf-κb activity in t-cells  <cit> . therefore, bcl <dig> activation was evaluated in both control and pma stimulated cells after  <dig> min,  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h using western blot analysis. the bcl <dig> levels decreased following treatment with pma, while in control cells, bcl <dig> returned to higher levels by  <dig> h . this suggests that bcl <dig> is involved in the pma dependent inhibition of nf-κb activation.

discussion
nf-κb and ap- <dig> are critical regulators of inflammatory responses, proliferation and differentiation of t-cells  <cit> , however, the signal transduction and subsequent cytokine/chemokine expression is not fully understood. the aim of the present study was to investigate il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> regulation by nf-κb and ap- <dig> in jurkat t-cells.

our results demonstrated that pma induced ap- <dig> activation, indicating a specific activation of the mapk pathway. furthermore, we demonstrated that pma dependent ap- <dig> activation in t-cells was delayed  and increased following long-term treatment. mapk is one of the main signalling pathways in t-cells that regulate cell- and transcriptional activation  <cit> . several studies  <cit>  have indicated the importance of ap- <dig> in t-cell activation and the induction of inflammatory responses  <cit> , including pro-inflammatory cytokine release. in contrast to ap- <dig>  nf-κb activity rapidly increased  during pma exposure followed by a down-regulation to the lowest levels at  <dig> h. this is in line with park and colleagues  <cit>  who demonstrated a rapid increase in nf-κb activity following short-term stimulation with pma, but prolonged challenge resulted in a persistent inhibition of nf-κb. they showed that the inhibition of nf-κb was due to pkc-dependent degradation of iκb kinase β and γ in response to pma. interestingly, the hk e. coli exposure induced nf-κb activation without affecting ap- <dig> activity. wang and colleagues  <cit>  reported an elevated inflammatory response by obtaining expression of il- <dig> following the exposure of t-cells to peptidoglycan. reduction in nf-κb by calcium ionophore following hk e. coli stimulation may be due to the ca2+ binding protein calmodulin , which has been shown to negatively regulate c-rel when activated  <cit> . the regulation of nf-κb and ap- <dig> observed in the present study was in agreement with earlier studies.

t-cells produce a broad range of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  tnf and il- <dig>  in response to infections or other stress factors  <cit> . the assessment of jurkat t-cell inflammatory responses  revealed an enhanced il- <dig> expression upon exposure to pma or hk e. coli due to pkc activation  <cit> . in addition to the transcription factor nf-κb, ap- <dig> binding sites have been identified in the il- <dig> promoter region, indicating multiple regulation  <cit> . ap- <dig> and nf-κb have also been demonstrated to regulate cxcl <dig> expression during induction of inflammatory responses in t-cells  <cit> . furthermore, il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> gene-expression is associated with an early immune response in jurkat t-cells  <cit> . in the present study, both pma and hk e. coli resulted in comparable increases in il- <dig> while pma was more potent at activating cxcl <dig> release. pma and hk e. coli treatment also induced tnf expression. tnf is one of the first cytokines induced by t-cells  <cit>  and its expression is regulated by calcineurin, nfat and atf-2/jun  <cit> . however, pma-stimulated jurkat t-cells showed no difference in il- <dig> expression indicating an induced inflammatory response. hk e. coli treatment resulted in a significant reduction of il- <dig> expression. the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> is known to inhibit t-cell activation, proliferation and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig> and inf-γ  <cit>  and regulate inflammatory responses by inducing t-cell anergy  <cit> .

the time course analysis of cytokine expression showed a correlation between ap- <dig> and the chemokine cxcl <dig> where cxcl <dig> expression was significantly elevated already at 2- <dig> h after pma exposure. the cxcl <dig> expression did not correlate with the early nf-κb activation  or with the down-regulation of nf-κb at  <dig> h post exposure. both il- <dig> and tnf expression were up regulated between 6- <dig> h. during this period, nf-κb increased from its minimum level at  <dig> h. pkc has been shown to be associated with the activation of ap- <dig>  but not with nf-κb activation of the il- <dig> promoter  <cit> . mutation of the nf-κb site did not affect il- <dig> expression, whereas mutation of the ap- <dig> site or pkc depletion almost revoked il- <dig> release. these observations indicate that the mapk pathway and the transcription factor ap- <dig> play an important role in the induction of inflammatory responses in jurkat t-cells  <cit> . the obtained results signify that cxcl <dig> was primarily regulated through the mapk pathway.

the nf-κb activation inhibitor  showed specificity against nf-κb and resulted in a complete il- <dig> inhibition following induction with pma and significant il- <dig> reduction after hk e. coli treatment. cxcl <dig> was highly up regulated by pma and the addition of nai resulted in a minor reduction in cxcl <dig> expression. furthermore, cxcl <dig> expression was not affected by nai following hk e. coli treatment, indicating a lack of correlation between cxcl <dig> and nf-κb. further analysis of cxcl <dig> expression revealed a down-regulation by pkc- and jnk- inhibitors, suggesting an involvement of ap- <dig> via pkc and jnk, respectively. analysis of gene expression further confirmed that il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> were upregulated by pma. expression of il- <dig> dropped below basal levels following inhibition of nf-κb and jnk whereas cxcl <dig> remained elevated above basal levels  following the same treatment. furthermore, inhibition of pkc did not result in a significant decrease of il- <dig> or cxcl <dig>  which is in accordance with protein data . these results suggest that nf-κb is involved in il- <dig> regulation and release while it is not required for the expression of cxcl <dig> in jurkat t cells.

the transcription factor nf-κb is responsible for a rapid immune response which is followed by an increase in transcription of iκb thus inhibiting nf-κb  <cit> . activation of nf-κb in jurkat t-cells is dependent on bcl <dig> activation, which in turn is regulated by pkc. recent studies have established the importance of a protein complex consisting of carma <dig>  bcl <dig> and malt <dig> , in the induction of nf-κb. investigating bcl <dig>  scharschmidt and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that it is a critical regulator of nf-κb activity. down-regulation of bcl <dig> from signals transduced via the tcr/cd <dig> and pkc resulted in a concomitant down-regulation of nf-κb. they suggested that bcl <dig> is initially activated by tcr/pkc but that continued activation  promotes its degradation. narayan and colleagues  <cit>  suggested that deletion in any of the three cbm complex proteins impairs antigen-receptor dependent activation of nf-κb. they showed that nf-κb activation via akt requires carma <dig> and acts in cooperation with pkc following short-term exposure  of jurkat t-cells with pma. akt phosphorylates and thus activates bcl <dig>  these studies indicate that pkc is crucial for nf-κb activation following short-term treatment through signals via membrane bound receptors such as the tcr and the co-stimulatory receptor cd <dig>  thus, the cbm complex proteins play a key role in this signalling process. pma diffuses into the cytosol and directly activates pkc since it is an analogue to diacylglycerol  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated that inhibition of pkc blocks nf-κb and ap- <dig> activity, suggesting a direct regulation of these transcription factors by pkc  <cit> . pkc is activated at an early stage following t-cell stimulation and is therefore an important regulator of downstream inflammatory signalling pathways leading to cytokine expression  <cit> . we have shown that phosphorylated-pkc is up regulated in response to pma and hk e. coli, indicating an association between pkc and the transcription factors ap- <dig> and nf-κb. bcl <dig> levels were down-regulated following extended treatment of jurkat t-cells with pma. in the control groups, a loss of bcl <dig> occurred after  <dig> h, followed by an increase after  <dig> h, which is in accordance with the observed nf-κb activity . these results are supported by an earlier study  <cit> , demonstrating that prolonged pkc activation by pma leads to an inhibition of bcl <dig> and nf-κb.

it has been shown that nf-κb is an important transcription factor complex involved in almost every aspect of cell regulation including apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation and initiation of immune responses  <cit> . nf-κb is constitutively active in many human malignancies, which makes it an attractive therapeutic target  <cit> . elevated cxcl <dig> levels during chronic inflammation result in an enhanced recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, which may lead to the development of autoimmune diseases following secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. in hiv infected persons, serum cxcl <dig> levels are elevated and this could recruit more t-cells potentially leading to a more rapid progression of the disease since there will be more t-cells available to infect.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, il- <dig> release was found to be associated with nf-κb activity while cxcl <dig> release more closely correlated with ap- <dig> activity. treatment of jurkat t-cells with pma was more potent than hk e. coli at elevating the cxcl <dig> levels. pma induced ap- <dig> activation and down-regulated nf-κb while hk e. coli up-regulated nf-κb without affecting ap- <dig> activity. in addition, the temporal induction pattern of ap- <dig> correlated to the release of cxcl <dig> while il- <dig> followed the nf-κb activity. likewise, blocking nf-κb activation resulted in a complete inhibition of il- <dig> while the cxcl <dig> levels remained elevated as shown both at the protein and mrna level. furthermore, the cxcl <dig> release was down-regulated by inhibition of jnk activity. the present study indicates that in jurkat t-cells, il- <dig> is regulated through nf-κb while cxcl <dig> regulation is independent of nf-κb and closely associated with ap- <dig> activation.
