BACKGROUND
bryozoans , also known as "moss animals", are aquatic organisms that mostly live in colonies of interconnected individuals. they usually encrust rocky surfaces, shells or algae. they are an ecologically important group, with the marine species forming a dominant component of benthic subtidal marine communities. this group is also economically important because it is a major component of both marine and freshwater biofouling, and evolutionarily important as a long-living phylum with a good fossil record  <cit> . the phylum is currently reported to contain  <dig> extant species. however, it is likely that more than twice that number are currently in existence  <cit> , with new taxa being described annually.

together with the brachiopoda and phoronida, bryozoa have been classified as "lophophorata" because they possess a similar suspension feeding apparatus, the lophophore, which is a horseshoe-shaped structure that surrounds the mouth and has ciliated tentacles  <cit> . however, lophophorate phylogeny remains one of the most controversial issues in metazoan animal phylogeny because they display an amalgam of deuterostome and protostome features. the "lophophorata" have been classified as deuterostomes on the basis of morphological and larval features  <cit> . on the other hand, molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that the lophophorates have some affinities with mollusks and annelids within the protostomes  <cit> .

lophophorate phylogenies that have been reconstructed with mitochondrial protein-coding genes and nuclear ribosomal dnas have failed to resolve the detailed relationships among the lophophorates and other related metazoan phyla  <cit> . most studies of complete mitochondrial genomes have focused on chordate and arthropod phylogenies because only a few mitochondrial genomes from lophotrochozoan phyla have been determined to date. so far, complete lophotrochozoan mitochondrial genome sequences have been published for  <dig> species from  <dig> phyla, including  <dig> mollusks,  <dig> annelids,  <dig> brachiopods,  <dig> bryozoan,  <dig> phoronid ,  <dig> entoprocts,  <dig> platyheminths,  <dig> nemertean ,  <dig> rotifer,  <dig> chaetognaths,  <dig> acanthocephalan and  <dig> echiuran. if the mollusk data are excluded, only  <dig> mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced from the huge protostome group  so far.

complete mitochondrial genomes have been characterized from a variety of metazoan phyla so that nucleotide, amino acid and gene order data can be used to resolve their phylogenetic relationships. mitochondrial genomes are generally conserved in terms of gene components   <cit> , and a number of studies have taken advantage of the various levels of phylogenetic information offered by mitochondrial genomes to solve systematic and evolutionary questions over a broad taxonomic range  <cit> .

mitochondrial protein-coding genes have recently been used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of lophophorates  <cit> . the results show that the phylum brachiopoda  belongs to the lophotrochozoan protostomes and that brachiopoda have a close relationship with molluska and annelida within the monophyletic clade, lophotrochozoa. the second lophophorate phylum, phoronida , has also been placed within the lophotrochozoa. phoronis has the almost same gene arrangement as the chiton, katharina tunicata   <cit> . phylogenies based on most of the molecular data strongly suggest that two lophophorate phyla, brachiopoda and phoronida, are closely related to each other , and they appear to be sister groups of mollusks and annelids within the lophotrochozoa  <cit> .

in an attempt to address the phylogenetic position of bryozoans in metazoan phylogeny, the first mitochondrial genome from a ctenostome bryozoan, flustrellidra hispida , was recently sequenced and characterized. however, f. hispida exhibits a number of peculiar features, such as extensive translocation of gene components including protein-coding and trna genes, and extremely reduced size. phylogenetic trees inferred from the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of its protein-coding genes were mutually conflicting, so the phylogenetic position of f. hispida was not assigned. thus, it is necessary to sequence additional mitochondrial genomes from more representative and widely-distributed bryozoans in order to address the issue of the phylogenetic position of bryozoans on the basis of mitochondrial genome information.

in this paper, to address whether or not lophophorates are a monophyletic group and to examine the exact phylogenetic position of bryozoa, we describe the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of bugula neritina , one of the most widely-distributed cheliostome bryozoans. the result is compared with the f. hispida sequence. we also explore the following: the monophyly of the class gymnolaemata, the phylogenetic implication of the gene orders in lophophorate mitochondrial genomes, the secondary structures of extremely multiplied noncoding regions, etc.

RESULTS
genome organization
the mitochondrial genome sequence of bugula neritina is  <dig>  bp long and consists of  <dig> protein-coding genes , two rrna genes for the small and large subunits , and  <dig> trna genes, as is typical of the animal mitochondrial genomes published so far . the a+t content of the entire mitochondrial genome of b. neritina is  <dig> %. interestingly, we found  <dig> multiplied noncoding regions . all the protein-coding and rrna genes and  <dig> of the trna genes are transcribed in the same strand in b. neritina; the other five trnas are , . the first bryozoan mitochondrial genome reported from f. hispida  <cit>  has only  <dig> gene components because trns is absent, it is relatively short , and the a+t content is lower . in contrast, b. neritina has features that are more typical of metazoan mitochondrial genomes in general in terms of the number of gene components, whole genome size and a+t content.

extreme multiplication of noncoding region
strikingly, the b. neritina mitochondrial genome contains  <dig> multiplied noncoding regions:  <dig> noncoding regions  larger than  <dig> bp  and  <dig> smaller . the total length of the  <dig> noncoding regions larger than  <dig> bp is  <dig> bp. three of them – nc <dig>  between trna and trnk, nc <dig>  between trnk and rrns and nc <dig>  between trny and cox <dig> – could be candidate origins of replication. trnk, one of the five trna genes transcribed on the light strand, is located between nc <dig> and nc <dig>  the placement of trnk between these two possible control regions is likely to have occurred very recently and independently only in the specific evolutionary lineage of b. neritina, since it has never been found in any other metazoan. the remaining  <dig> noncoding regions  total  <dig> bp in length and are dispersed throughout the whole genome, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in size . in addition,  <dig> small intergenic gaps  were identified between some gene components .

a: gap nucleotides  or overlapped nucleotides  between adjacent genes.

most metazoan mitochondrial genomes reported so far possess only a single major noncoding region, which is thought to be involved in the regulation of transcription and the control of dna replication  <cit> . in general, possible control regions possess characteristic features such as high a+t contents, hairpin-loop structures, repeat motifs, etc.  <cit> . in b. neritina, there are three possible control regions . their a+t contents are  <dig> % in nc <dig>   <dig> % in nc <dig> and  <dig> % in nc <dig>  all of which are much higher than the  <dig> % of the mitochondrial genome as a whole. in nc <dig>  nc <dig> and nc <dig>  we found some hairpin-loop structures that might be related to the mode of regulation of replication and transcription . nc <dig> and nc <dig> possess no characteristic repeat motifs but have extensive poly "a" and poly "c" tracts , as often observed in mitochondrial control regions in other metazoans  <cit> . intriguingly, nc <dig>  includes at least nine "ctt" repeats with a short helix consisting of a 5-base-pair stem and a 3-nt loop . despite its short length , the existence of "ctt" repeats and a hairpin-loop may suggest that nc <dig> is important in regulating mitochondrial replication and transcription. in addition to these, nc <dig> between trnw and trnl has a helix with a 5-bp stem .

such multiple noncoding regions are rare in metazoan mitochondrial genomes. the other bryozoan sequenced, f. hispida, has  <dig> noncoding regions, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . among these, two possible control regions were observed between trnc and trng  and between cox <dig> and trnd , which are separated by cox2-trng  <cit> . the mollusk loligo bleekeri  has  <dig> noncoding regions longer than  <dig> bp. three of these  <dig> are  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp long, and their sequences are nearly identical, suggesting that all three originated from a single, large, ancestral noncoding region. in lampsilis ornata ,  <dig> noncoding regions were found, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in size. of these, only one large noncoding region  has an increased a+t content , so it is a possible control region. since no such extreme multiplication of noncoding regions has been observed in any other bivalve or cephalopod mollusk including katharina tunicata, it is likely that the extreme multiplication of noncoding regions is a homoplasious characteristic, occurring independently in the lineages of l. bleekeri, l. ornata and b. neritina.

comparative analysis of gene arrangements
unlike other metazoan mitochondrial genomes in which genes are encoded on both strands, all the protein-coding and rrna genes and  <dig> of the trna genes – the exceptions being the five trna genes trnl, trna, trne, trny and trnv – are transcribed from the same strand in b. neritina . in f. hispida, one protein-coding gene , one ribosomal rna gene  and four trna genes , trnv and trnv) are reversed. such a single-strand-dependent transcription tendency has been reported for  <dig> among the  <dig> metazoan species in  <dig> phyla for which complete or nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequences have been determined to date . except for six tunicates , all the remaining  <dig> cases were from protostomes or primitive metazoan groups:  <dig> protostomes including  <dig> lophotrochozoans and  <dig> nematodes, and  <dig> primitive metazoans including  <dig> cnidarians and  <dig> poriferans, the most primitive metazoan groups . the single-strand dependence of transcription might be a plesiomorphic, ancestral characteristic because such a tendency appears in  <dig> out of  <dig> primitive metazoans  such as cnidaria and porifera .

2) the number of mitochondrial genomes showing single-strand dependent transcription tendency

the arrangements of the protein-coding and rrna genes were compared among two bryozoans , a brachiopod , a phoronid  and a polyplachophoran  . the overall gene arrangement in b. neritina was quite different from those in other metazoans published so far. compared to the f. hispida sequence, b. neritina needed  <dig> local translocations and  <dig> inversion to have the same gene order. on the other hand, only  <dig> translocations from a brachiopod, t. retusa, and  <dig> translocations with  <dig> inversion from a phoronid, p. architecta, would produce the gene arrangement of b. neritina; therefore, the gene arrangement in t. retusa is most similar to that of b. neritina. the b. neritina gene arrangement could be obtained from that of t. retusa by only five translocation events  with no inversions. the phoronid gene arrangement was identical to that of katharina with only one exception, a difference in the position of atp <dig> 

nucleotide composition and codon usage
as shown in table  <dig>  the overall a+t content of the b. neritina mitochondrial genome is  <dig> % , which is typical of the base compositions of metazoan mitochondrial genomes. however, it is unusual in comparison to those of other bryozoans and brachiopods; it is much higher than those of f. hispida  and of three brachiopods, t. retusa , t. transversa  and l. rubellus .

at skew = /; cg skew = /

the codon usage pattern of the b. neritina mitochondrial protein-coding genes is shown in table  <dig>  there is a clear preference for a+t-rich codons; the five most frequently used codons are uua  for leucine, aua  for methionine, auu  for isoleucine, uuu  for phenylalanine and aaa  for lysine. compared to other lophotrochozoans, the b. neritina mitochondrial genome showed a strong bias to a+t codons with dramatically lower g+c content. the anticodon nucleotides in b. neritina were completely identical to those of the brachiopod laqueus rubellus  <cit>  and the annelid lumbricus terrestris  <cit>  except for trnl and trny. however, two anticodons – uuu in trnk and ucu in trns – in b. neritina were different from those used in most other metazoans. the trna anticodon corresponding to the codon agn for serine is ucu, as in nematode mitochondrial genomes, but in most other metazoan mitochondrial genomes such as those of platyhelminthes, mollusks, drosophila and echinoderms, the serine trna anticodon is gcu rather than ucu  <cit> .

athe number of codons used in  <dig> mitochondrial protein-coding genes

transfer rna genes
the b. neritina mitochondrial genome contains  <dig> typical trna genes interspersed between the  <dig> rrna and  <dig> protein-coding genes. this result differs from that of f. hispidia, which has only  <dig> trna genes because of the two serine trna genes, trns and trns, trns is absent  <cit> . if we obtain more bryozoan mitochondrial genome data, it might be possible to provide reasonable evolutionary interpretations through further comparative analyses with respect to the absence/presence of trns. thirteen of the  <dig> inferred b. neritina mitochondrial trnas have uniform features that are invariant in typical cloverleaf-shaped secondary structures with a 7-bp amino-acyl arm, 5-bp anticodon stem and 4-bp variable loop . two trnas  have no dhu arm or tψc arm. the tψc arm and variable loop are replaced by a single tv loop. in four trnas , the dhu arms are replaced by a loop. the unpaired dhu arm in trnaser has been considered a typical feature of animal mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . trnaser with an unpaired dhu arm has also been reported for some protostomes:  <dig> nematodes ,  <dig> mollusks ,  <dig> brachiopods  and  <dig> annelid . we also found loss of the dhu arm from trnacys in the brachiopod l. rubellus, as in b. neritina.

regardless of formation of a stable dhu arm, the first of  <dig> nts separating the amino-acyl stem from the dhu arm region is "t" in  <dig> trnas and the second is "a" in  <dig> trnas, and  <dig> nt separating the dhu arm region from the anticodon stem is "a" in  <dig> trnas. the  <dig> bp preceding the anticodon are always pyrimidines, with two exceptions – 'gu' in trnaleu and 'aa' in trnatyr – and the  <dig> nt nearest the anticodon is "t" in  <dig> cases, the exception being 'a' in trnatyr. the nt immediately after the anticodon is always a purine  with two exceptions – trnaglu and trnatyr have "u" in the same position. among the  <dig> trnas that form a stable tψc arm, 4-nt variable arms typical of metazoan mitochondrial trnas were observed in  <dig> trnas, 5-nt variable arms in  <dig> trnas, trnaasp and trnaser, and 6-nt variable arms in trnaglu. the inferred anticodons for  <dig> trnas in b. neritina were the same as those in the other bryozoan, f. hispida , but anomalies were detected in two trnas: trnatyr with aua instead of gua, and trnaleu with gag instead of uag. the former has been reported for a few metazoans such as the predatory mite metaseiulus occidentalis  <cit>  and a onychophoran, epiperipatus biolleyi  <cit> , but the latter has never previously been reported for any metazoan. the trnaleu with gag may be considered an interesting feature unique to b. neritina. however, further experimental studies are needed to determine whether if it is a truly unique characteristic of b. neritina, or whether it results from a simple error in deducing the anticodon of trnaleu from the nucleotide sequence of trnl.

ribosomal rna genes
the two rrna genes are generally separated by at least one gene . in b. neritina, rrns and rrnl are separated by trnn instead of trnv; trnv is located between trnr and trnq. assuming that the rrna genes occupy all the available space between the adjacent genes, rrns and rrnl are approximately  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp in length, respectively. the a+t contents of rrns  and rrnl  are similar to the  <dig> % of the whole mitochondrial genome. the total size  of the b. neritina mitochondrial rrnas was greater than those of the bryozoan f. hispida ,  <dig> brachiopods ,  <dig> annelids  and a polyplacophoran mollusk k. tunicata , but less than those of a bivalve, mytilis edulis , and a cephalopod, l. bleekeri .

phylogenetic position of bryozoans and lophophorate phylogeny
as shown in fig.  <dig> and , the first step of phylogenetic analysis  was performed on the basis of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of  <dig> protein-coding genes in  <dig> metazoa , in order to explore the phylogenetic position of bryozoans and lophophorate phylogeny within the lophotrochozoa. all four trees showed that the two bryozoans  formed a strong monophyletic group  and mlnt , and bpp  <dig>  in biaa  and bint ). no tree supported lophophorate monophyly, except for the mlaa tree in fig.  <dig>  in which lophophorates including entoprocta are grouped together with a weak node confidence value . the sister group of the bryozoan clade appeared to be brachiopods , except that the biaa tree clustered bryozoa with phoronida . as shown in fig.  <dig> and , owing to possibly long-branch attraction artifacts , all resultant ml and bi trees regardless of the data types employed showed unexpected groupings with extremely low node confidence values. in addition, phylogenetic trees inferred from nucleotide sequence data  had relatively lower node confidence values especially in deep branches. amino acid-based trees  showed relatively higher node confidences in deep branches than the nucleotide-based trees .

to resolve the problem of long-branch attraction,  <dig> nematodes and  <dig> platyhelminths were excluded from the first data set for the second-round phylogenetic analyses. the ml and bi trees newly obtained with the reduced data set, including  <dig> taxa comprising  <dig> protostomes ,  <dig> deuterostomes and  <dig> primitive metazoans  were improved, robust and reliable with higher nodal support values. within the lophotrochozoa, all four trees  showed that the monophylies of the two bryozoans  and the three brachiopods  were strongly supported with strong nodal supports . in all four trees shown in fig.  <dig>  the strong monophyletic bryozoan clade, within the lophotrochozoa, was grouped with a monophyletic brachiopod clade . the clade of bryozoa + brachiopoda was grouped with the clade of annelida including echiura as a subtaxon . p. psamophila  was clustered with entoprocta in mlaa  and biaa, which is consistent with the result of yokobori et al.  <cit>  based on mitochondrial protein-coding genes. in contrast, p. psamophila was grouped with a chiton, k. tunicate, in mlaa  and biaa . this indicates that the phylogenetic positions of phoronida, entoprocta and k. tunicata are still ambiguous. no tree in fig.  <dig> supports lophophorate monophyly.

the results of the present phylogenetic analyses revealed that lophophorates are placed with mollusks and annelids as members of a monophyletic lophotrochozoan group. this is consistent with evidence from 18s rrna  <cit> , hox genes  <cit> , na/k atpase α-subunit  <cit>  and molecular data  <cit> . therefore, it strongly suggests that the long-held view inferred from morphological data  <cit>  that deuterostomes have affinity with bryozoa and the other two lophophorates should be refuted. recent reports on lophophorate phylogeny based on ssu rrna gene sequences  <cit>  coincide with the present result in that lophophorates are unambiguously affiliated with protostomes rather than deuterostomes.

contrary to the present findings, which cluster bryozoa with brachiopoda, some previous ssu rrna-based results have shown that brachiopods and phoronids  form a separate clade from the bryozoans and even suggest that phoronids may be members of the inarticulate brachiopods  <cit> . however, the present trees did not show the brachiozoa grouping at all.

to clarify the statistical support for each grouping such as the monophylies of brachiozoa, lophophorata, the old-concept bryozoa   <cit>  and the sister group bryozoa + brachiopoda, we performed tree topology tests . the results indicate that on the basis of statistical probability, the sister group of bryozoa + brachiopoda could be the annelida-echiura or the phoronida + entoprocta clade. if the latter is a true phylogeny, lophophorate monophyly including entoprocta may be supported. the tree topology test is likely to indicate that brachiozoa  and the recently reinstated old-concept bryozoa may be refuted, but according to the present data the sister group of bryozoa is brachiopoda .

despite intensive phylogenetic analyses, phylogenetic relationships among lophotrochozoan members including lophophorates and others unfortunately remain unclear because there are conflicts among the phylogenetic trees reconstructed by different tree-making methods, with different data types and with different taxon samplings . the phylogeny signal of mitochondrial genome nucleotides and/or amino acids alone may be unable to resolve what may have been a relatively rapid radiation during the cambrian  <cit> . recently, to overcome such limitations, huge est data sets from a number of metazoans have been employed to resolve metazoan phylogeny  <cit> . the results still left the phylogenetic position of bryozoans unclear, and lophophorates did not form a monophyletic group. further more intensive studies seem to be necessary to resolve the exact phylogenetic position of the bryozoans and to examine the question of lophophorate monophyly.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the complete mitochondrial genome of a cheliostome bryozoan, b. neritina. comparison of the orders of the protein-coding genes showed the possibility that three lophophorates are closely related, including k. tunicata. the present phylogenetic analyses suggest the probable relationships , annelida-echiura), or , ), but the phylogenetic position of phoronids is still ambiguous. consequently, the results seem to imply that the three lophophorate members did not form a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic trees and this possibility was also refuted statistically. however, according to the tree topology test, lophophorate monophyly including entoprocta – , ) – was not refuted. in addition, brachiozoa  and the recently-reinstated old-concept bryozoa may be refuted, but according to the present data the sister group of bryozoa is brachiopoda . however, because only a few samples of lophophorates were used here and there were some conflicts among the resultant trees, it is better to postpone a final decision on the phylogenetic position of bryozoans and on lophophorate phylogeny. until more mitochondrial genomes become available and until we know more about the evolution of these organelle genomes, we may not come to any conclusion with respect to the monophyly or polyphyly of the lophophorates.
