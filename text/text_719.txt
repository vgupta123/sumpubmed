BACKGROUND
oxycodone  is a strong semi-synthetic opioid. it is prescribed to treat multiple types of pain, especially when other opioids are ineffective. oxycodone has close structural similarity to morphine and heroin and binds not only μ- but also κ-opioid receptors. oxycodone’s ability to rapidly cross the blood–brain barrier allows it to reach higher concentrations in the central nervous system  than in plasma . these properties contribute to oxycodone’s powerful analgesic as well as potential for abuse and addiction. the use of oxycodone in the us increased by 866 % from  <dig> to  <dig> and accounted for almost half of total opioids dispensed in  <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig>  the us population consumed over  <dig> tons of oxycodone  <cit> . unfortunately, like other opioids, repetitive oxycodone administration has the potential to lead to development of analgesic tolerance, withdrawal, and addiction. several studies demonstrate that chronic opioid exposure, including oxycodone, alters gene expression profiles. these changes in gene expression contribute to the opioid-induced analgesic effect, as well as the development of tolerance, and dependence . however, little is known about opioids ability to alter the translational machinery in cns tissues.

opioids are known to induce clinically significant levels of hypoxia due to respiratory depression, increase intracellular ca2+ levels , and induce the production of nitric oxide   <cit> , and extracellular glutamate transmission  <cit> . moreover, opioid exposure is linked to the induction of oxidative stress in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, and in cell cultures  . hypoxia, excessive production of reactive oxygen species  and no, increased extracellular glutamate, and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress by aberrant calcium flow, have all been shown to trigger a defensive mechanism called the integrated stress response   <cit> . the key event in isr, regardless of the trigger, is phosphorylation of translation initiation factor  <dig> alpha  that modulates expression and translational activation of specific mrnas important for adaptation to the stress. in metazoa, there are four kinases that phosphorylate eif2α:  gcn <dig>  general control nonderepressible  <dig> kinase, which is activated in response to amino acid deprivation, uv irradiation, and proteasome inhibition;  hri, the hemin-regulated inhibitor kinase, that was found to inhibit protein synthesis in heme-deprived lysates and stressed cells;  pkr, protein kinase r, which is activated by double-stranded rna and shuts down translation during viral infection; and  perk, a pkr-like endoplasmic reticulum  kinase, which is activated as part of the unfolded protein response  to the er stress  <cit> . phosphorylation of eif2α reduces general translation but allows the ribosome to initiate translation of specific mrnas containing upstream open-reading frames  in their 5′utr via leaky scanning  <cit> , including the transcription factor atf <dig>   <cit> . the expression level of atf <dig> and downstream events then determine whether the cell will adapt to the stress condition and continue to grow or will undergo apoptosis. the induction of the isr in brain tissues due to chronic opioid administration has never been investigated.

we hypothesize that chronic opioid administration triggers the isr and thus modulates phospho-eif2α-dependent translation. to test this hypothesis, we used an animal model in which female rats were orally gavaged with 15 mg/kg oxycodone every 24 h for 30 days. in this study we observed that chronic oxycodone exposure induces oxidative/nitrosidative stresses in three areas of the brain: the nucleus accumbens, cortex, and brain stem. western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrates that activation of the isr in oxycodone-exposed brain tissues occurs, inducing over-expression of hsp <dig> and bip, increasing phosphorylation of eif2α and translationally up-regulating the phospho-eif2α-dependent mrnas. to investigate whether oxycodone induces isr in the receptor-dependent manner we treated breast adenocarcinoma mcf <dig> cells, which are known to express the μ-opioid receptor, with oxycodone for 24 h and demonstrated that activation of the isr was partially abrogated by pre-treatment of cells with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone.

RESULTS
daily oxycodone treatment activates signaling pathways characteristic of both acute and chronic opioid response in rat nucleus accumbens
first, to determine the antinoceptive effect of oxycodone and development of tolerance in rats, we performed a hot plate assay. rats were placed on a hot plate and the latency lick the hind paw was measured . the latency time for the lower dose,  <dig>  mg/kg, of oxycodone-treated rats was nearly double that of untreated rats, while at high dose, 15 mg/kg, the latencies of oxycodone-treated rats increased threefold from  <dig>  s to approximately 24 s. the high doze treatment with oxycodone, 15 mg/kg, for 30 days showed development of effective chronic analgesia, similar to that seen in human dosing. thus, to study the effect of chronic oxycodone exposure, we treated rats with either vehicle  or 15 mg/kg oxycodone by oral gavage every 24 h for 30 days.fig.  <dig> model for chronic exposure to oxycodone dosing. a hot plate assay to test the antinociceptive effect of oxycodone and the time of tolerance development in rats. oxycodone  or water was administered by oral gavage every 24 h for 29 days. rats were placed on a hot plate and the time spent until they licked the hind paw was measured. each point represents a mean value of measurement from  <dig> animals . there was an effect of treatment , day  and a treatment × day interaction . *p <  <dig>  vs water; # p <  <dig>  vs oxy  <dig>  mg/kg . oxy oxycodone; water vehicle treatment. b western blot analyses of signalling pathways of rewarding circuit in nucleus accumbens. representative images of western blots of total and phosphorylated camkii, total and phosphorylated pka, total and phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  cfos, and gapdh in nucleus accumbens of water  and oxycodone  treated rats. below panel—graphs representing the densitometric analysis of western blots. the graphs represent the mean ratio of phosphorylated protein to corresponding total protein, and mean ratio of cfos to gapdh. oxycodone data were normalized to that in water samples from three different drug administration experiments . data was analyzed by student’s t test. p-camkii/camkii, p <  <dig> ; p-pka/pka, p <  <dig> ; p-erk1/2/erk1/ <dig>  p <  <dig> ; cfos/gapgh, p <  <dig> . open bars water samples; gray filled bars oxycodone samples



because of the potential for the development of abuse and addiction, we investigated the effect of oxycodone on reward signaling in nucleus accumbens of animals sacrificed 2 h after administration of the last dose. it has been found that pkc and camkii are responsible for activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase erk1/ <dig> in nucleus accumbens after acute opioid exposure, while pka activates erk1/ <dig> during chronic treatment . activation of erk1/ <dig> leads to increased expression of immediate-early genes, including c-fos, which is known to account for the opioid rewarding effect . to investigate whether our regiment of treatment induces chronic response, we monitored the level of phosphorylation of camkii, pka, and erk1/ <dig>  as well as the expression level of cfos in nucleus accumbens by western blot analysis. each sample lysate contained the nucleus accumbens tissue from three rats. the oxycodone data  were normalized to the corresponding water-control data  from the same treatment experiment. results are presented on fig. 1b as the mean of three independent treatment  experiments . student’s t test was applied to the data to determine statistical significance. western blot analysis shows an increase from  <dig> - to over 3-fold in the phosphorylation level of camkii, pka, and erk1/ <dig> kinases in nucleus accumbens lysates of rats treated with oxycodone compared to that of water-treated animals . in agreement with erk1/ <dig> activation, the cfos protein expression increased more than  <dig> -fold in the nucleus accumbens of oxycodone-exposed rats . these data indicate that the proposed dosing of oxycodone and daily regimen for 30 day produces neuronal activation in the nucleus accumbens that correlates with both acute and chronic signalling leading to rewarding properties.

chronic oxycodone treatment induces oxidative and nitrosidative stresses
to investigate whether chronic oxycodone induces oxidative stress in rat brain, we monitored the level of the 8-hydroxyguanosine  signal as a marker of oxidative damage in nucleic acids. immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant increase in staining of 8-h in the nucleus accumbens, cortex, and brain stem areas in oxycodone-exposed rats . increased 8-h staining was observed in the nucleus of various cell types, including neuronal and glial cells, suggesting the induction of oxidative damage to dna is a systemic effect of chronic oxycodone exposure.fig.  <dig> chronic oxycodone treatment induces biomarkers of oxidative and nitrosidative stresses. a. immunohistochemical analysis of oxidized dna in nucleus accumbens , cortex, and brain stem of rats treated with water  or oxycodone . tissues were stained with antibodies against 8-hydroxyguanosine . representative images of area next to anterior commissure  in nuacc, striatum in cortex area, cerebellum in brain stem area. scale bar denotes: nuacc, 100 μm; cortex, 50 μm; stem, 20 μm. below the images is statistical analysis of the data. open bars water samples; gray filled bars oxycodone samples. the intensity of 8h-ab stating in nucleus accumbens, cortex, and cerebellum was analyzed using meanq method. the graphs represent the mean value of signal in three different animals . data was analyzed by student’s t test. nuacc, n =  <dig> fields in water and n =  <dig> fields in oxycodone samples containing 9– <dig> cells each, p <  <dig> . cortex, n =  <dig> fields in water and n =  <dig> fields in oxycodone samples containing 6– <dig> cells each, p <  <dig> . stem, n =  <dig> fields in water and n =  <dig> fields in oxycodone cerebellums containing 23– <dig> cells each, p <  <dig> . b dot-blot analysis of lysates from nucleus accumbens, cortex, and brain stem of rats treated with water  or oxycodone . two μg of total proteins were spotted on nc membrane and then probed with antibodies against either nitro-tyrosine  or actin . the 3n signal was normalized to the corresponding actin signal in each sample and then oxycodone data was normalized to the corresponding water data. the graph represents the mean ratio of oxycodone to water data obtained in three separate experiments using lysates from different drug administration experiments . data was analyzed by student’s t test. nuacc, nucleus accumbens, p <  <dig> ; cortex, p <  <dig> ; stem, brain stem, p <  <dig> . open bars water samples; gray filled bars oxycodone samples



opioid use is also linked to excessive production of no  <cit> . increased levels of no and superoxide form peroxynitrite, which modifies tyrosine, produces 3-nitrotyrosine  and leads to protein damage. to investigate whether chronic oxycodone treatment induces protein modification caused by oxidative and nitrosidative stresses we monitored the level of 3-nitrotyrosine in rat brain lysates. each lysate sample contained corresponding tissues from three rats. the 3n signal was normalized to the corresponding actin signal in each sample and then oxycodone data was normalized to the corresponding water data . the graph represents the mean ratio of oxycodone to water data obtained in three separate experiments using lysates from different drug administration experiments . data was analyzed by student’s t test. dot-blot analysis shows a significant increase in 3n-ab immunoreactivity in all three brain lysates: nucleus accumbens, cortex, and brain stem, from oxycodone-exposed animals . these data indicate that, like other opioids, prolonged oxycodone treatment induces oxidative and nitrosidative stress in rat brain.

oxycodone induces the integrative stress response in rat brain
to investigate whether oxycodone induces the isr we monitored the expression levels of hsp <dig> in brain lysates. hsp <dig> is one of the major heat shock proteins induced in the central nervous system as part of the general response to a variety of cellular stresses . real-time pcr analysis of total rna isolated from nucleus accumbens, cortex and brain stem lysates showed a 7- to 17-fold increase in hsp <dig> mrna level in all three tissues from the oxycodone-exposed animals compared to that from the water-treated animals . in agreement with real-time pcr data, western blot analysis of lysates from the nucleus accumbens, cortex and brain stem showed an increase in hsp <dig> protein levels in all three brain areas of oxycodone-treated rats . overexpression of hsp <dig> in the nucleus accumbens, cortex and brain stem lysates suggests that chronic oxycodone administration induces cellular stress in the rat brain. we also observed increased levels of hsp <dig> in blood samples of oxycodone-exposed animals suggesting a systemic effect of oxycodone .fig.  <dig> oxycodone induces integrative stress response in rat brain. a. western blot analysis of hsp <dig>  bip and phosphorylated eif2α in rat brain lysates from nucleus accumbens, cortex, and brain stem of rats treated with water  or oxycodone . left, the representative images of western blots. right, graphs of the densitometric analysis of western blots. the graphs represent the mean ratio of signal of hsp <dig> to gapdh, bip to actin, or phospho-eif2α to total eif2α with oxycodone data normalized to water samples in corresponding tissues . western blot analysis was performed for each set of proteins using lysates from three separate drug administration experiments and repeated at least twice for each set of lysates. hsp <dig>  nuacc, p <  <dig> ; cortex, p <  <dig> ; stem, p <  <dig> . bip, nuacc, p <  <dig> ; cortex, p <  <dig> ; stem, p =  <dig> . phospho-eif2α, nuacc, p <  <dig> ; cortex, p <  <dig> ; stem, p <  <dig> . open bars water samples; gray filled bars oxycodone samples. b polysomal analyses of nucleus accumbens in sucrose density gradients. upper panels the representative images of polysomal distribution of nucleus accumbens lysates from water and oxycodone-treated animals in sucrose density gradients. top of the gradient is on left side of each image. direction of sedimentation is shown. the polysomal analysis was repeated three times using lysates from different drug administration experiments. lower panels the representative images of western blots of 60s ribosomal protein l7a , eif4a, eif4e, and hsp <dig> in corresponding fractions  along sucrose gradients. the western blot analysis of proteins was investigated in two sucrose density gradients using lysates from separate drug administration experiments



to investigate whether oxycodone induces the unfolded protein response, which is one of the pathways that triggers the isr, we monitored the expression levels of bip. chaperone bip serves as a sensor of endoplasmic reticulum  stress. western blot analysis showed significant increase in bip level in both nucleus accumbens and cortex lysates of oxycodone-treated animals suggesting activation of upr in these brain areas . interestingly, no changes in the bip levels in brain stem lysates were observed by western blot.

western blot analysis of brain lysates also demonstrated a significant increase in the phosphorylated translation initiation factor 2α  level in all three tissue lysates from the oxycodone-exposed animals: nucleus accumbens, cortex, and brain stem . the phosphorylation status of eif2α serves as a marker of integrated stress response  that also includes upr. since we cannot exclude that, beside endoplasmic reticulum stress, other triggers may contributes to cellular stress response leading to phosphorylation of eif2α, we suggest that chronic oxycodone treatment induces integrated stress response in rat brain.

modulation of the translational machinery is a part of the isr that facilitates cellular adaptation to stress. to investigate the effect that oxycodone has on general translation, we performed ultracentrifugation of lysates from nucleus accumbens in sucrose density gradients. we chose lysate from nucleus accumbens because of the smaller size of the tissue and higher cellular homogeneity compared to other brain tissues containing cortex or brain stem. the polysomal profiles of the nucleus accumbens lysates from water and oxycodone-treated animals did not show significant differences . also, the distribution of the large ribosomal subunit  along sucrose density gradients was similar between oxycodone- and water-exposed nucleus accumbens . however, distribution of the translation initiation factors 4a  and 4e  significantly changed after oxycodone exposure . although, the majority of the translation initiation factors co-sedimented with ribosomal fractions in both water- and oxycodone-exposed tissue lysates , in oxycodone lysate a significant portion of eif4a and eif4e also accumulated on the top of the sucrose density gradients . interestingly, in oxycodone-treated samples, hsp <dig> co-sedimented with ribosomal complexes  and also accumulated on the top of the gradient , similar to eif4a and eif4e . co-sedimentation of hsp <dig> with ribosomal complexes and translation factors is in agreement with hsp70’s role in co-translational folding of newly synthesized proteins. sedimentation of hsp <dig> at the top of the gradient for the oxycodone lysate may indicate accumulation of protein complexes targeted by hsp <dig> for refolding or proteolysis.

oxycodone stimulates translation of the phospho-eif2α-dependent mrnas
to investigate the effect that chronic oxycodone treatment has on translation of the mrnas that are specifically regulated by phosphorylation of eif2α, we monitored the distribution of atf <dig> and pdgfrα mrnas in the sucrose density gradients similar to that shown on fig. 3b. the atf <dig> mrna has two upstream open reading frames and is known to be translationally activated by phosphorylation of eif2α  <cit> . the pdgfrα mrna was shown to be translationally de-repressed in a perk-dependent manner following er stress in mouse liver  <cit> . as a control, we monitored polysomal distribution of actin mrna, which synthesizes a house-keeping protein and is not translationally regulated by activation of the eif2α kinases  <cit> . first, we confirmed that oxycodone treatment did not affect the total amount of actin, atf <dig>  and pdgfrα mrnas in the nucleus accumbens lysates . to investigate the effect that oxycodone has on the translational efficiency of actin, atf <dig> and pdgfrα mrnas we isolated rna from each fraction of the sucrose density gradients and performed real-time pcr assay using specific primers. in fig. 4a, the amount of individual mrna in each fraction is presented as a percentage of the amount of this mrna in all  <dig> fractions. to analyze the amount of individual mrna in the polysomal fractions, representing efficiently translated mrna , we expressed it as a percentage of mrna sedimented in all fractions set as 100 % .fig.  <dig> chronic oxycodone exposure modulates translation in rat nucleus accumbens area. a

we did not observe any changes in actin mrna distribution along the sucrose density gradient upon oxycodone treatment . statistical analysis showed that about 80 % of the actin mrna co-sedimented with polyribosomal complexes  in both water and oxycodone nucleus accumbens samples. in contrast, a significant portion of atf <dig> mrna in water-exposed nucleus accumbens lysate sedimented on the top of the sucrose gradients , containing inhibited or slowly-translated mrnas. however, in oxycodone-exposed nucleus accumbens lysate, atf <dig> mrna accumulated in the heavier part of the gradient, which contains more efficiently translated mrnas compared to that of the water-treated samples . interestingly, oxycodone exposure shifted a fraction of the atf <dig> mrna from the heavy complexes  to the middle part of the gradient, suggesting changes in the rate of translation for this mrna. statistical analysis showed an increase in the amount of atf <dig> mrna that co-sedimented with the polyribosomal complexes  in oxycodone nucleus accumbens lysates  compared to that of the water-treated lysates . the distribution of pdgfrα mrna along sucrose density gradients also changed dramatically after oxycodone exposure. real-time pcr analyses showed that in the nucleus accumbens of the water-treated animals, the majority of mrna accumulated in fractions 2– <dig> containing inhibited or slowly-translated mrnas . however, in the oxycodone-exposed nucleus accumbens, the majority of pdgfrα mrna accumulated in the heavy polyribosomal complexes , containing efficiently translated mrnas. statistical analysis showed an increase in the amount of pdgfrα mrna that co-sedimented with the polyribosomal complexes  in oxycodone-treated nucleus accumbens lysate  compared to that of water-treated lysate . these results suggest that chronic oxycodone exposure stimulated translation of atf <dig> and pdgfrα mrnas in the rat brain areas containing the nucleus accumbens.

to confirm translational activation of atf <dig> and pdgfrα mrnas by chronic oxycodone treatment we monitored the atf <dig> and pdgfrα protein expression in nucleus accumbens and compared it to the actin level. immunohistochemical staining showed no change in actin protein levels after oxycodone treatment . in contrast, the atf <dig> and pdgfrα protein levels increased almost twofold in the nucleus accumbens area in animals treated with oxycodone. interestingly, this brain area also demonstrated increased staining for phospho-eif2α  and oxidized dna , confirming the induction of integrated stress response in oxycodone-exposed nucleus accumbens.

oxycodone differentially activates the isr in various brain areas
to investigate whether chronic oxycodone induces the isr biomarkers in other brain areas we monitored the bip, atf <dig>  and pdgfrα expression in corpus collosum, striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. in corpus collosum, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that chronic oxycodone administration increased percentage of cells expressing bip, atf <dig>  and pdgfrα by  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold respectively . this area also demonstrated induction of the oxidative stress as monitored by 8-hydroxyguanosine signal . interestingly, in water animals, 30–50 % of cells in corpus collosum showed expression of bip, atf <dig>  and pdgfrα  suggesting activation of the integrated stress response in cells in white matter area even under normal conditions. this could be a result of endoplasmic reticulum stress due to neuronal activity. induction of oxidative stress by chronic oxycodone treatment may further increase stress level in these cells and, thus, stimulate expression of the stress-response proteins such as bip and atf <dig>  in striatum, the level of atf <dig> and pdgfrα expression also increased after chronic oxycodone exposure . cells lining the blood vessels  showed increased staining for both proteins, atf <dig> and pdgfrα, as well as oxidized dna , suggesting induction of the isr in these cells in response to oxidative stress following oxycodone treatment. this result also indicates that the isr may affect the blood–brain barrier cellular composition during oxycodone administration.fig.  <dig> oxycodone increases atf <dig> and pdgfrα expression in corpus collosum and striatum. a immunohistochemical analysis of bip, atf <dig>  and pdgfrα in corpus collosum. upper panels representative images of corpus collosum areas of rats treated with water  or oxycodone . scale bar denotes 50 μm. lower bars statistical analysis of the data. open bars water samples; gray filled bars oxycodone samples. the graphs represent the mean value of percentage of cells expressing bip, atf <dig>  or pdgfrα in corpus collosum areas obtained from three animals . in each slide, at least  <dig> fields containing 25– <dig> cells were investigated. statistical analysis was performed using student’s t test. bip, p <  <dig> ; atf <dig>  p <  <dig> , pdgfrα, p <  <dig> . b immunohistochemical analysis of atf <dig>  pdgfrα, and oxidized dna  in striatum areas of rats treated with water  or oxycodone . scale bar denotes 20 μm. arrows point to the blood vessels



in cortical areas, immunohistochemical analysis showed almost twofold increase in expression of bip, mostly in pyramidal cells, but no difference in atf <dig> and pdgfrα staining after oxycodone treatment . similarly, oxycodone increased the percentage of cells expressing bip in hippocampal areas, but did not affect atf <dig> and pdgfrα expression levels . these data suggest that in specific brain areas, such as cerebral cortex and hippocampus, prolong oxycodone administration induces endoplasmic reticulum stress without activation of the integrated stress response.fig.  <dig> oxycodone increases bip but not atf <dig> and pdgfrα expression in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. a immunohistochemical analysis of bip, atf <dig>  and pdgfrα in cerebral cortex of rats treated with water  or oxycodone . scale bar denotes 50 μm. b immunohistochemical analysis of bip, atf <dig>  and pdgfrα in hippocampus of rats treated with water  or oxycodone . scale bar denotes 50 μm



in the cerebellum of oxycodone treated animals, the isr biomarkers: hsp <dig>  bip, phosphorylated eif2α, and atf <dig>  were all localized in purkinje cells, suggesting activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and induction of the isr by chronic oxycodone . in contrast, the majority of the pdgfrα staining increased in granular and molecular layers of oxycodone-exposed tissues, similar to that of oxidized dna staining . this result suggests that pdgfrα expression may also be triggered by a mechanism other than the isr during oxycodone exposure. fig.  <dig> oxycodone increases atf <dig> in purkinjie cells and pdgfrα expression in granular layer of cerebellum. a immunohistochemical analysis of hsp <dig>  bip, phosphorylated eif2α, and atf <dig> in purkinje cells. upper panels representative images of purkinje cells  of rats treated with water  or oxycodone . scale bar denotes 20 μm. wm white matter; gl granule layer; ml molecular layer. lower bars statistical analysis of the data. open bars water samples; gray filled bars oxycodone samples. the intensity hsp <dig>  bip, phosphorylated eif2α, and atf <dig> staining in purkinje cells was analyzed using the q method. the graphs represent the mean value of intensities measured in brain slides obtained from three animals for each treatment . in each slide, at least  <dig> fields containing 6– <dig> purkinjie cells each were investigated. statistical analysis was performed using student’s t test. hsp <dig>  p <  <dig> ; bip, p <  <dig> ; p-eif2α, p <  <dig> ; atf <dig>  p <  <dig> . b

oxycodone activates the isr in mcf- <dig> cells
to investigate whether oxycodone induces the integrative stress response in an opioid receptor-dependent manner, we used breast adenocarcinoma mcf <dig> cells, which are known to express the μ-opioid receptor. first, we pre-treated cells with either water or 10 μm the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone for 15 min and then added 5 μm oxycodone or vehicle and incubated the cells for another 24 h. we did not observe morphological changes in cells treated with oxycodone alone or in combination with naloxone .

western blot analyses revealed a significant increase in phopsho-eif2α, atf <dig>  bip, and hsp <dig> staining after incubation with oxycodone, suggesting the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the isr . pre-treatment of cells with naloxone completely abrogated the increase in phosphorylation of eif2α by oxycodone, suggesting that prolonged oxycodone exposure induces the isr in the receptor-dependent manner . the atf <dig>  bip, and hsp <dig> levels in cells pre-treated with naloxone followed by incubation with oxycodone varied significantly from experiment to experiment, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the stress response in a receptor-independent manner . interestingly, bip protein levels also significantly increased in cells incubated with naloxone alone suggesting that either treatment, prolong agonist  or antagonist , induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in these cells . however, naloxone-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress was not sufficient to activate the isr since naloxone alone failed to increase phosphorylation of eif2α or overexpression of atf <dig> and hsp <dig> . these data suggest that prolonged oxycodone treatment induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and the isr.fig.  <dig> oxycodone activates the integrated stress response in mcf <dig> cells. western blot analysis of phosphorylated and total eif2α, atf <dig>  bip, hsp <dig>  and actin in mcf <dig> cell lysates treated with water and vehicle , 10 μm naloxone and vehicle , water and 5 μm oxycodone  or combination of 10 μm naloxone and 5 μm oxycodone . left the representative images of western blots of corresponding proteins. right

discussion
to investigate the effect of chronic oxycodone administration, we treated female 60 day-old sprague–dawley rats with 15 mg/kg oxycodone or water by oral gavage every 24 h for 30 days. we have previously demonstrated that this model is well-tolerated by the rats  <cit> . some tolerance does develop, but there are no measurable physiological indices of dependence and withdrawal with the continual dosing regimen. the dosing regimen provides an opioid level leading to antinociception, which makes it a clinically relevant model. if there is stress associated with the model, we feel that it would be similar to that in a human situation.

in this study, we demonstrated that the integrated stress response  is induced by chronic oxycodone administration in rats and cell culture models. the isr is activated by various triggers, allowing cells to adapt to changing environments or to initiate programmed cell death. hypoxia, endoplasmic reticulum stress due to aberrant ca2+ flow, or the induction of excitotoxic stress, are all associated with opioid abuse. the isr is manifested by overexpression of several factors including hsp <dig>  indeed, previously it was found that morphine induces expression of hsp <dig> in the rat amygdala  <cit> , frontal cortex  <cit> , locus coeruleus  <cit> , as well as in cultured hippocampal neurons  <cit> . moreover, it was demonstrated that morphine increases the hsp <dig> mrna level in rat brain in the temperature-independent manner  <cit>  supporting the idea of stress as a major trigger of the opioid-induced hsp <dig> expression. in this study, we also demonstrate that chronic oxycodone administration leads to an increase in both hsp <dig> mrna and protein levels in brain lysates from the nucleus accumbens, cortex, and brain stem. moreover, ultracentrifugation of the nucleus accumbens lysates from oxycodone-treated animals in sucrose density gradients shows co-sedimentation of hsp <dig> with translational complexes that included ribosomes, translation initiation factors eif4e and eif4a, and mrnas, in agreement with the hsp <dig> role in co-translational protein folding. we also observed sedimentation of hsp <dig> on the top of the gradient possibly with unfolded proteins.

our observation that chronic oxycodone administration induced expression of hsp <dig> in various rat brain areas is in contrast to several reports that did not find evidence for the induction of hsp <dig> expression after opioid treatment. one study investigating the effect of chronic oxycodone treatment on the gene expression profile in whole rat brain did not detect changes in the expression level of hsp <dig>  <cit> . this discrepancy could be due to the fact that very often the microarray protocol involves enrichment of mrna fraction via purification with oligo magnetic beads. however, since hsp <dig> mrna lacks the poly-tail, it will be lost during sample preparation. in another study using human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells expressing mor <dig>  a 2-h treatment with morphine did not increase hsp <dig> mrna expression  <cit> . in the study presented here, we demonstrate induction of hsp <dig> expression in mcf <dig> cells after 24-h treatment with oxycodone, suggesting that late events such as the accumulation of cellular damage trigger hsp <dig> overexpression by opioid exposure. moreover, pre-treatment of mcf <dig> cells with naloxone did not completely abolish the increase in hsp <dig> levels by oxycodone supporting the idea that late events may trigger cellular stress in a receptor-independent manner. one such event could be endoplasmic reticulum  stress. our and others data suggest that excessive or chronic opioid administration induces er stress leading to activation of the unfolded protein response . one study demonstrated that chronic morphine treatment induced neuronal pathological changes in rough endoplasmic reticulum in the ventral tegmental area  <cit> . in another study, morphine administration caused about twofold increase in bip gene level, a biomarker of upr, in rat frontal cortex  <cit> . we observed bip protein overexpression in various brain areas after chronic oxycodone exposure, including the nucleus accumbens, corpus collosum, cerebral cortex, and brain stem. we also demonstrated induction of the bip in mcf <dig> cells after 24-h oxycodone treatment. naloxone alone also led to increased bip protein expression suggesting that both antagonist and prolonged agonist treatments are capable to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress.

in neurons, activation of bip by calcium mobilization or accumulation of unfolded/damaged proteins in er may lead to phosphorylation of the pkr-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase  and its downstream target, translation initiation factor eif2α, and these initiate the upr. in addition, phosphorylation of eif2α is also triggered by a variety of other stresses including hypoxia, excessive production of ros and no or increase in extracellular glutamate that activates defensive mechanism called integrated stress response   <cit> . in general, phosphorylation of eif2α leads to the attenuation of global protein synthesis but stimulation of translation of specific mrnas containing upstream open-reading frames  in their 5′utr via leaky scanning  <cit> . such an approach allows cells to reduce the load of misfolded proteins in er but stimulates expression of proteins necessary for survival during stress. the atf <dig> mrna has two uorfs and was shown to be translationally up-regulated by phosphorylation of eif2α  <cit> . the atf <dig> is transcription factor that regulates down-stream genes expression in response to variety of stresses.

the effect of opioid exposure on activation of integrated stress response including phosphorylation of eif2α and overexpression of atf <dig> has never been investigated. we demonstrated increased phosphorylation of eif2α and translational up-regulation of the atf <dig> mrna in various areas of rat brain after chronic oxycodone treatment including the nucleus accumbens, corpus collosum, striatum, and brain stem. interestingly, in purkinje cells, hsp <dig>  bip, phosphor-eif2α, and atf <dig>  were all localized in cell bodies suggesting induction of er stress and activation of the isr by chronic oxycodone exposure. we also demonstrated overexpression of hsp <dig>  bip, and atf <dig> and also increased phosphorylation of eif2α in mcf <dig> cells after 24-h incubation with oxycodone suggesting the direct link between opioid exposure and induction of the isr. interestingly, phosphorylation of eif2α was abrogated by pretreatment of cells with naloxone suggesting the μ-opioid receptor-dependent mechanism of the oxycodone-mediated eif2α phosphorylation. however, the rest of isr members: hsp <dig>  bip, and atf <dig> demonstrated fluctuation in response to oxycodone after pre-treatment of cells with naloxone, suggesting that part of the stress response in these cells is receptor- and phospho-eif2α-independent.

we also demonstrated translational upregulation of pdgfrα mrna and increased pdgfrα protein expression in several oxycodone-exposed brain areas. previously, pdgfrα mrna was identified as one of the mrnas that shifted into polysomes in the eif2α kinase, perk, activation-dependent manner  <cit> . we observed localization of pdgfrα and the isr machinery, bip, phopsho-eif2α, and atf <dig> in nucleus accumbens, striatum, and cerebellum. some cells adjacent to the blood vessels in oxycodone-exposed brains demonstrated increased staining for atf <dig>  pdgfrα, and oxidized dna, suggesting induction of the isr in cells controlling the blood–brain barrier  integrity. previously it was shown that activation of pdgfrα may contribute to altered bbb permeability as a compensatory effect to increase oxygen flow  <cit> . indeed, a connection between opioid exposure and bbb impairment has been described in several studies. for example, human brain microvascular endothelial cells  treated with morphine induces production of pdgf that lead to disruption of bbb  <cit> . in a rat model, withdrawal after chronic morphine administration resulted in increased bbb permeability  <cit>  that was markedly attenuated by pretreatment with an antioxidant h-290/ <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a link to the oxidative stress.

thus, we observed increase in expression of biomarkers of the endoplasmic reticulum stress  and integrated stress response  in nucleus accumbens, corpus collosum, striatum, and purkinjie cells in rats treated with 15 mg/kg oxycodone for 30 days. however, in cortical and hippocampal areas prolong oxycodone treatment stimulated expression of bip without activation of the isr suggesting different than endoplasmic reticulum rout of stress induction by oxycodone. since cells in these brain areas expressed bip at lower level even in the water-treated animals, it is possible that this pro-survival pathway promotes better adaptation of the neuronal cells to more severe stress.

the link between other drugs of abuse and induction of the isr in brain has been reported. large doze of methamphetamine induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and expression of hsp <dig>  bip, atf <dig>  and other stress-response biomarkers in rat striatum after just 1 day of treatment  <cit> . interestingly, co-administration of methamphetamine with a putative dopamine receptor d1-agonist, sch <dig>  completely blocked expression of these proteins suggesting a receptor-dependent mechanism of the isr induction. increase in atf <dig> expression was demonstrated in response to amphetamine administration in rats  <cit> . the atf <dig> transcriptional activity was shown to contribute to the post-synaptic terminal and dendritic spine morphology  <cit>  suggesting the mechanism of the opioid-induced modulation of neuronal plasticity. methamphetamine  <cit>  and cocaine, have been also shown to induce bbb leakage  <cit> . thus, our and other’s studies suggest that drugs of abuse may activate the integrated stress response in specific brain areas. the members of the isr machinery may serve as targets for the therapeutic protection against drug-induced neuronal impairment and the bbb disruption.

active protein synthesis is important for neuronal plasticity  <cit> . further study needed to investigate how drug abuse modulates translational machinery and whether these changes contribute to development of tolerance, addiction, or pain perception. overall, this study suggests that prolonged opioid treatment affects translational machinery via modulation of activity of the translation factors that affects translation of specific mrna and thus may contribute to the changes in neuronal plasticity during drug abuse.

CONCLUSIONS
our study found that chronic oxycodone administration triggers induction of oxidative and nitrosidative stresses in rat brain. we demonstrated activation of the integrated stress response: overexpression of hsp <dig>  bip, and atf <dig> and also increased phosphorylation of eif2α, in rat brain and mcf <dig> cell culture by prolonged oxycodone treatment. moreover, we found that prolonged opioid treatment affects translational machinery suggesting the mechanism of opioid-induced changes in neuronal plasticity during drug abuse that contribute to development of tolerance, addiction, or pain perception. our report documenting increased expression of pdgfrα in brain tissues after chronic oxycodone treatment also suggests a new target for the therapeutic protection against drug-induced bbb disruption.
