BACKGROUND
bioluminescence is an enchanting process in which light is produced by a chemical reaction within an organism  <cit> . bioluminescence is found in various organisms like ctenophora, bacteria, certain annelids, fungi, fish, insects, algae, squid, etc. most of these organisms are found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats  <cit> . the bioluminescence mechanism involves two chemicals, namely luciferin, a substrate, and the enzyme luciferase  <cit> . luciferase catalyses the oxidation of luciferin, resulting in light and an intermediate called oxyluciferin. sometimes, the luciferin catalyzing protein  and a co-factor such as oxygen are bound together to form a single unit called photoprotein. this molecule is triggered to produce light when a particular type of ion is added to the system. the proportionality of the light emission makes a clear distinction between a photoprotein and a luciferase  <cit> . photoproteins are capable of emitting light in proportion to the amount of the catalyzing protein, but in luciferase-catalyzed reactions, the amount of light emitted is proportional to the concentration of the substrate luciferins  <cit> .

different creatures produce different colors of light, from violet through red  <cit> . the different colors of light produced are often dependent on the roles the light plays, the organism in which it is produced, and the varieties of chemicals produced. the dominant color on land is green, because it reflects best against green plants. the most common bioluminescent color in the ocean is blue. this color transmits best through sea water, which can scatter or absorb light.

bioluminescence serves a variety of functions, but many of them are still unknown. the known functions include camouflage, finding food, attraction of prey, attraction of mates, repulsion by way of confusion, signaling other members of their species, confusing potential predators, communication between bioluminescent bacteria , illumination of prey, burglar alarm, etc  <cit> .

the application of bioluminescence promises great possibilities for medical and commercial advances. bioluminescent proteins serve as invaluable biochemical tools with applications in a variety of fields including gene expression analysis, drug discovery, the study of protein dynamics and mapping signal transduction pathways, bioluminescent imaging, toxicity determination, dna sequencing studies, estimating metal ions such as calcium, etc  <cit> .

the detailed analysis of bioluminescence proteins helps to understand many of the functions which are still unknown and also helps to design new medical and commercial applications. due to advances in sequencing technologies, huge amount of data is available in various databases  <cit> . despite tremendous progress in the annotation of protein, there are no existing online tools available for the prediction of bioluminescent proteins using primary protein sequences.

a support vector machine  is a supervised learning algorithm, which has been found to be useful in the recognition and discrimination of hidden patterns in complex datasets  <cit> . svm has been successfully applied in various fields of computational biology, e.g., protein sequence/structure analysis, micro-array and gene expression analysis  <cit> .

in this work, we present a novel prediction method that uses a support vector machine  and physicochemical properties to predict bioluminescent proteins. so far, bioinformatics and statistical learning methods like support vector machine and random forest have not been explored for the prediction of bioluminescent proteins. in this paper, we report a svm approach to identify bioluminescent proteins from sequence information, irrespective of the sequence similarity.

RESULTS
performance of similarity based search using psi-blast
similarity search methods play a vital role in the classification of proteins. psi-blast is the most popular similarity based search method for searching sequence databases  <cit> . psi-blast search for each query sequence was performed against the database of  <dig> bioluminescent proteins that were used for the training and testing. three iterations of psi-blast were carried out at a cut-off e-value of  <dig> . it was observed that  <dig> bioluminescent proteins showed similarity  with other bioluminescent protein sequences . the performance of the sequence similarity method drops when there is no significant sequence similarity between two proteins. hence, such an alignment-based method would rarely yield satisfactory predictions. therefore, there is a need for alignment-free methods  for predicting bioluminescent proteins.

prediction of bioluminescent proteins by blprot
a svm classifier was applied to predict bioluminescent proteins. each sequence was encoded by  <dig> features. the detailed flowchart of our work is shown in figure  <dig>  the model was trained with a dataset containing  <dig> bioluminescent protein sequences and  <dig> non-bioluminescent protein sequences. blprot achieved  <dig> % training accuracy  with all of the  <dig> physicochemical properties .

to identify the most prominent features, we carried out feature selection with three different filter approaches, relieff, info gain, and mrmr. we selected five different feature subsets by decreasing the number of features, and the performance of each feature subset was evaluated . the best performance of 80% training accuracy was achieved with relieff selecting  <dig> features. hence, this is chosen as the final model for our work.

after training, we tested our algorithm on the test dataset consisting of  <dig> bioluminescent protein sequences and  <dig> non-bioluminescent proteins sequences. the maximum accuracy of  <dig> % with  <dig> % sensitivity and  <dig> % specificity was obtained using the top  <dig> features .

comparison of blprot with hmm and blast
the performance of blprot was compared with other sequence search methods, namely hmm and psi-blast using  <dig> bioluminescent proteins  <cit> . psi-blast search for each sequence was carried out against the swissprot database with an e value of  <dig> . hmm search for each query sequence was performed against the hmm profile obtained from the pfam database   <cit> . out of  <dig> proteins,  <dig> proteins were correctly predicted by blprot. psi-blast and hmm correctly predicted  <dig> and  <dig> proteins, respectively.

our algorithm was further evaluated by  <dig> hypothetical proteins obtained from the interpro, cdd and kegg databases  <cit>  . our approach correctly predicted all proteins as bioluminescent proteins. the performance of our algorithm was compared with psi-blast and hmm  <cit> . out of these  <dig> proteins, the psi-blast search retrieved bioluminescent protein hits from the swissprot database for only  <dig> proteins. no hits were found for the remaining  <dig> proteins. similarly, hmm search against the pfam database returned no hits for  <dig> proteins. this result indicates that bl-prot is a useful approach for predicting bioluminescent proteins from sequence information in the absence of sequence similarity.

comparison with other machine learning methods
the proposed svm model was compared with several state-of-the-art classifiers such as j <dig> , part, random forest, adaboost and ibk  <cit> . we compared the performance of blprot with the other approaches using the same feature subset . all models were tested on the test dataset containing  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative sequences. the results are shown in table  <dig>  the prediction accuracy of blprot is about 7% and 12% higher than that of j <dig>  and part, respectively. although the sensitivity of blprot, random forest and ibk is comparable, blprot is superior in specificity and concerning the mcc values.

CONCLUSIONS
bioluminescence, the chemically-induced production of light within a living organism, is a process which varies among organisms. the application of bioluminescent proteins has wide medical and commercial values, which explains the interest for the identification of novel bioluminescent proteins. in this study, we developed a method for predicting bioluminescent proteins from its primary sequence using relieff coupled with svm. blprot will help the experimental biologist to predict bioluminescence from a protein sequence and, thus, help to avoid unnecessary experiments. the blprot program and dataset is available at http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/tools-demos/bioluminescent%20protein/blprot
