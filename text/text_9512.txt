BACKGROUND
maintenance of a stable internal environment is important for vertebrate animals to survive in a variety of habitats. even small changes in ionic balance, osmolarity, and ph of body fluid seriously affect the survival of the animals. strategies for maintaining body fluid homeostasis are different depending on animals and their habitats. freshwater  teleosts  maintain the osmolarity of extracellular fluid around  <dig> mosm, while the osmolarity of the environmental freshwater is generally less than  <dig> mosm. in order to balance passive loss of salts and gain of water, they take up salts from fw through the gills and excrete a lot of dilute urine from which most of the salts have been reabsorbed by the kidney  <cit> . marine teleosts also maintain the osmolarity of extracellular fluid to a level similar to that of freshwater fish, despite that the osmolarity of seawater  is approx.  <dig> mosm. in order to balance passive loss of water and gain of salts, they drink seawater, absorb salts and water both in the intestine, and excrete salts through the gills  <cit> . the systems used by teleosts to adapt to fw and sw differ not only in the direction of ion and water movements but also in their molecular components. euryhaline fish adapts to both fw and sw by switching these systems.

to identify the molecular components involved in body fluid homeostasis, the change of expression of each gene during adaptation of euryhaline fishes to different salinities is a potential useful marker since the genes involved are expected to be drastically up- or down-regulated during the adaptation. in fact, several genes have been identified by this strategy using euryhaline fishes such as tilapia  <cit> , salmon  <cit> , killifish  <cit> , and eel  <cit> . however, this systematic approach is very laborious because genome sequences are not available for the euryhaline fishes that are currently being used for molecular physiological studies.

takifugu is a genus of puffer fish and belongs to the family tetradontidae of teleost fish. it consists of approx.  <dig> species living in the northwest pacific ocean around china, korea, and japan  <cit> . takifugu species are famous for their puffing behavior, powerful toxins in the internal organs, and edible muscle. two species are farmed on a commercial scale: t. rubripes is farmed in japan and t. obscurus, in korea and china. the takifugu species have an advantage as animal model, in that they have a short genome  compared to those of other vertebrates including homo sapiens , mus musculus , gallus gallus , xenopus laevis , danio rerio , and oryzias latipes   <cit> . in  <dig>  the genome project of t. rubripes was completed and the sequence information is now available for free on the websites  <cit> .

within the genus takifugu, two species are known to be anadromous, namely, t. obscurus  <cit>  and t. ocellatus  <cit> . t. obscurus  is found in the east china sea, the south china sea, and inland waters in china and the korean peninsula. it lives in the bottom layer of inshore and inland waters, and grows 20– <dig> cm in length. most of the growth takes place in the sea but they spawn in brackish and fresh water. during the spawning season, which is from late spring to early summer, the sexually mature fish run into river estuaries and spawn in inland waters including rivers, lakes, and ponds. the fingerlings grow in the inland water and either return to the sea the next spring or they there for a few months before returning to the sea. in the sea they grow to sexually mature fish over several years, and then return to the inland water again to spawn. t. ocellatus is also found in an area similar to that of t. obscurus. t. ocellatus is a small species and grows to around  <dig> cm in length. the life cycle of t. ocellatus has not been well described but is expected to be similar to that of t. obscurus.

in this study, we focus on the suitability of t. obscurus as a novel animal model for studying the molecular mechanism of body fluid homeostasis. first we compared the adaptability of t. obscurus to fw with those of other takifugu species, and showed that only t. obscurus is fully adaptable to both sw and fw. next we demonstrated that changes in blood na+ concentration of t. obscurus during fw adaptation are kept within the physiological range while those of t. niphobles decline beyond the range. finally we isolated and sequenced 16s ribosomal genes from six takifugu species including t. obscurus, t. niphobles, and t. rubripes, and demonstrated that those sequences are 99% identical within the genus takifugu. with the euryhalinity and applicability of the currently available fugu genome sequence, we conclude that t. obscurus is a useful animal model for studying the mechanism of osmoregulation.

RESULTS
survival of takifugu species in fw
a summary on six takifugu species used in this study is shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the survival rate of each species after transfering from sw to fw is shown in figure 2a. the results show the mean values of several experiments. the mean survival in fw was:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days, and more than  <dig> days for t. porphyreus, t. poecilonotus, t. rubripes, t. niphobles, t. pardalis, and t. obscurus, respectively. in a separate experiment, we confirmed that t. obscurus could survive for at least  <dig> weeks in fw without any apparent difficulties . these data suggest that only t. obscurus is fully adaptable to both fw and sw among the six takifugu species tested. of the five species that could not survive in fw, four  were able to adapt to bw  .

the fishes that survived for  <dig> days in bw were transferred to fw and survival was monitored . mean survival in fw were:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days for t. niphobles , t. poecilonotus , and t. pardalis , respectively. mean survival in fw following the transfer from bw did not differ significantly between t. poecilonotus and t. pardalis, and was short for t. niphobles  when compared to the survival of those that were transferred from sw to fw. these results indicate that  <dig> days' adaptation to bw does not improve the adaptability of t. poecilonotus, t. pardalis, and t. niphobles to fw.

changes in serum osmolarity and concentrations of ions and urea during adaptation
to gain insights into the way that the takifugu species adapt to different salinities, we sampled the blood from two species, t. obscurus and t. niphobles, and determined serum osmolarity and concentrations of ions and urea . in sw, serum osmolarity and ion concentration of t. obscurus and t. niphobles were similar to those reported for other teleost fish  <cit> . when transferred to fw, however, significant changes were observed in serum osmolarity and concentrations of na+ and cl- for t. niphobles, whereas the changes were small for t. obscurus. the reductions in osmolarity during fw adaptation of t. obscurus and t. niphobles were - <dig> and - <dig> mosm, respectively. the decrements of serum concentrations of na+ and cl- during fw adaptation were - <dig> and - <dig> mm in t. obscurus, and - <dig> and - <dig> mm in t. niphobles, respectively. these results suggest that t. obscurus has a much stronger ability to maintain body fluid homeostasis against salinity fluctuations and can survive in fw.

comparison of nephron structure of takifugu species
kidney sections of the six takifugu species were analyzed to compare their nephron structures. under light microscope, a number of glomeruli were observed within all sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, demonstrating that all six takifugu species have glomerular nephrons . the glomeruli of fw-acclimated t. obscurus appeared to be loose compared to those of the sw-acclimated fish . there was no clear difference between those species rich in glomeruli at the histological level.

to characterize the segments of the renal tubules, kidney sections of t. obscurus, t. rubripes, t. niphobles, t. pardalis, and t. poecilonotus were stained with anti-na+-k+-atpase  antibody, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. nka is the most important molecule that provides a driving force for many transporting systems in the renal tubules, and the patterns of nka localization are different among the segments of renal tubule   <cit> . in both fw- and sw-acclimated t. obscurus, proximal and distal segments were clearly observed . in contrast, the distal segment is not found in t. rubripes, t. niphobles, t. pardalis, and t. poecilonotus .

phylogeny of takifugu species
to know the phylogenetic relationship of the takifugu species, we isolated the mitochondrial 16s rrna gene from each species and determined the sequence. resulting data were compared with the sequences of the 16s rrna genes of other species in databases, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed . surprisingly, the takifugu species were very closely related each other. the identities of 16s rrna within the takifugu species are 99% whereas those between takifugu and tetraodon nigroviridi, oryzias latipes, or homo sapiens were 86%, 77%, and 63%, respectively. our preliminary results of the nucleotide sequences of several cdna clones for ion transporters  and hormone receptors   <cit>  of t. obscurus were 99% identical to those of t. rubripes including the non-coding sequences . these results suggest that the takifugu species diversified very recently and the genome resources of t. rubripes can be used for studying the t. obscurus genes and their products.

discussion
through analyses of the ability of the takifugu species to adapt to fw, we have demonstrated that only t. obscurus exhibits a high adaptability to both fw and sw. this observation is consistent with their natural anadromous habitats . in our analyses, we used sexually immature fish  and large fish  with well developed testis or ovary. all the t. obscurus survived in both fw and sw for more than  <dig> days and they looked healthy, suggesting that size and sexual maturation do not affect their adaptability. recently, yan et al. reported the effect of salinity on food intake, growth, and survival of t. obscurus   <cit> . they cultured t. obscurus in fw, bw, and sw for  <dig> days and compare their level of food-intake and growth rates. the fish survived and grew under all conditions tested, and the growth rates in low-salinity bw  were better than those in fw, sw and high-salinity bw . their observation demonstrated that t. obscurus grows under a wide range of salinities and low-salinity bw is the best condition for young t. obscurus to grow.

our analyses also demonstrated that many other takifugu species exhibit a relatively high ability to cope with salinity changes. t. niphobles, t. rubripes, t. pardalis, and t. poecilonotus can survive in fw for several days and in bw for more than  <dig> days, suggesting that the takifugu species are potentially euryhaline. these results are consistent with their natural brackish/marine habitats; they are sometimes found in brackish river mouths . it is known that t. rubripes spawn in the entrance of bays. the fingerlings grow in shallow and river mouths of bays for one year, and then go to the broad ocean  <cit> . han et al. demonstrated that the best growing salinity of t. rubripes weighting ~ <dig> , ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig> g were 73–91%, 29%, and 43% sw, respectively  <cit> . thus change of the environmental salinity is important for the growth of the fingerlings of t. rubripes.

during the acclimation to fw, serum cl- of t. obscurus decreased although na+ and osmolarity remained unchanged. in t. niphobles the decrease in serum cl- was more extensive than that in serum na+. these results suggest that the mechanisms whereby cl- and na+ are regulated differ. the decrease in serum cl- during fw acclimation has also been observed in japanese eel   <cit>  and spotted green pufferfish   <cit> . in tetraodon and takifugu species, the other electrolytes that compensate for cl- were not determined. in the case of japanese eel, serum so42- concentration increases from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> mm during acclimation from sw to fw  <cit> . the expressions of kidney sulfate transporters are drastically induced during fw acclimation, suggesting that the serum so42- reabsorbed by the kidney compensates for cl- and helps improve the survival of eel in fw  <cit> .

some reports have categorized pufferfish as aglomerular  <cit> . however, glomerular nephrons was observed in the species of from four genuses of the tetraodontidae family, namely, canthigaster rivulatus  <cit> , tetraodon nigroviridis  <cit> , sphoeroides testudineus  <cit> , two takifugu species reported by ogawa  <cit> , and six takifugu species in this study . we think that many of the tetraodontidae species are glomerular. the increase in size of the glomerulus after transferring to fw  was also found in the threespine stickleback   <cit> . in general, the largest difference between fw fish and glomerular sw fish regarding structure of the renal tubules is the presence or absence of a distal segment, which acts as a urine-diluting segment in fw fish  <cit> . most of the euryhaline fish have a fw-fish type of nephron such as the european eel , pacific pink salmon , rainbow trout , southern flounder , armored sculpin , medaka , and spotted green pufferfish  <cit> . in the takifugu species, we demonstrated that only mefugu  has the fw-fish type of nephron with a distal segment, and the other species have a sw-fish type of nephron lacking a distal segment . these results are completely consistent with the ability of those species to adapt to fw, thus the presence of a distal segment is one of the most important factors that allow t. obscurus to be highly adaptalbe to a wide range of salinities.

tetraodon nigroviridis  is a small pufferfish less than  <dig> cm in length that lives in brackish river and estuaries of southeast asia. t. nigroviridis also has a compact genome like the takifugu species, and the whole genome was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> . recently, lin et al. have demonstrated the strong adaptability of t. nigroviridis to fw, bw, and sw and its use in studies on osmoregulation  <cit> . we think that both t. nigroviridis and t. obscurus are good models for studying osmoregulation. the advantage with t. nigroviridis is that it is readily available. the advantage with t. obscurus is that it can be used in a wide range of size  and compare the functions of the gill and kidney with those of other takifugu species that can not adapt to fw.

many molecules have been identified as components of the chloride cells , the major site of ion regulation in the gill: transporters, channels, and pumps for na+, k+, cl-, hco3-, h+, ca2+, water, and urea; carbonic anhydrase; and hormone receptors  <cit> . however, the complete physiological function of the chloride cells cannot be explaned by those components alone, and identification of further players is necessary. furthermore, little is known of the molecular biology of osmoregulation by the kidney and intestine of teleost fish: nka  <cit> , sulphate transporters  <cit> , urea transporter  <cit> , chloride channel  <cit> , ca2+-sensing receptor  <cit> , v-type h+-atpases  <cit>  in the kidney; na-pi cotransporter  <cit>  and aquaporin water channels in both the kidney and intestine  <cit> ; and na+/k+/2cl- cotransporter in the stomach and intestine  <cit> . by determining the differences in gene expression patterns in the gill, intestine, and kidney of fw- and sw-acclimated mefugu , we would be able to identify the genes that are important for osmoregulatory adaptation.

• members of the genus takifugu are very closely related and share ~99% sequence identities in their genomes as shown by a phylogenetic analysis using the mitochondrial dna sequence for the 16s ribosomal rna gene.

• the nephrons of fw- or sw-acclimated t. obscurus exhibit a structure that is typical of fw fish. on the other hand, t. rubripes, t. niphobles, t. pardalis, t. poecilonotus, and t. porphyreus have nephrons of that are typical of sw glomerular fish.

• t. obscurus can be used as an animal model for studying the molecular mechanism of osmoregulation by exploiting the takifugu genome resources.
