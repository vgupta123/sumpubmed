BACKGROUND
circadian rhythms are oscillations in the behaviour and biochemical reactions of organisms and occur with a periodicity of approximately  <dig> hours  <cit> . traditionally, the circadian system has been conceptualized in terms of three components: an input component, a clockwork component and an output component. recent studies, however, have shown that there are considerable overlaps between the three components at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, such that the three components may be organized into multiple interconnecting pathways  <cit> . in mammals, the input component is mediated at the macroscopic level by the visual perception of light. the master circadian clock is located in the hypothalamus as a pair of neuron clusters that are known as the suprachiasmatic nuclei . the output component is elaborated by endocrine mechanisms in the form of prokineticin  and, transforming growth factor-α  secretion  <cit>  from the scn which also engage other regions of the brain through neural connections. at the molecular level, the clockwork of the scn involves several proteins that participate in positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops. the mammalian bmal <dig> and clock are the transcription factors that contain two basic helix-loop-helix domains and bind e-box elements  in the period and cryptochrome clock genes and activate their transcription   <cit> . the period  and cryptochrome  proteins act as negative regulators of transcription that is driven by the bmal1/clock heterodimer   <cit> . per and cry form ternary complexes with casein kinase iε  in the cytoplasm. this ternary complex translocates into the nucleus, where they acts as a negative regulator of bmal1/clock-driven transcription  <cit> .

cryptochromes were initially identified as putative blue-light photoreceptors due to their high homology at the primary amino acid level to photolyase, which repairs ultraviolet -light-induced photoproducts in dna  <cit> . comparison of the crystal structures of plant cryptochrome and photolyase has revealed that the two classes of proteins are also structurally quite similar  <cit> . therefore, it is somewhat surprising that, unlike photolyase, cryptochrome does not possess dna repair activity  <cit> . however, cryptochrome has been proposed to act as a circadian photoreceptor  <cit> .

alignments of various cryptochromes and photolyases have shown that cryptochromes from mammals, plants, and insects have extended c-terminal domains that range from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, depending on the species  <cit> . studies on the arabidopsis cry protein have shown that the c-termini of crys mediate blue-light signals by interacting with cop proteins  <cit> . in addition, the drosophila cry protein transmits the blue-light signal by interacting with tim proteins through its c-terminus  <cit> . although the role of mammalian crys and their c-termini in circadian photoreception is not clear, their roles in circadian rhythms have been well established. previous studies have indicated that mammalian cryptochromes together with per2-ckiε inhibit bmal1-clock driven transcription  <cit> . using both yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems, it has been shown that cry directly interacts with both bmal <dig> and per <dig>  <cit> . recent studies have indicated that interaction between cry and clock and bmal <dig> occur through the c-termini of cry  <cit> . however, the clock-bmal <dig> interacting region of crys has not been defined at the amino acid level. in this study, we identified the amino acids of mcry <dig> c-terminus that are important for interaction with per <dig>  our results revealed that arg- <dig> and lys- <dig> are responsible for the interaction between mouse cry <dig> and per <dig> using the mammalian two-hybrid system with co- immunoprecipitation and mutagenesis.

RESULTS
analysis of interaction between mouse cry <dig> and per <dig>  bmal <dig> and clock
cry proteins have two domains: a core region with a high similarity to photolyases and c-terminal 'tails' that vary considerably in length and sequence both between the crys and photolyases and among individual crys  <cit> . the n-terminal region contains conserved binding sites for two cofactors, a flavin and the pterin , and functions as the photosensor in arabidopsis and drosophila crys  <cit> . however its precise role in mammalian crys remains to be defined. it is known that mammalian crys form a ternary complex with mper <dig> and ckiε and act as negative regulators that interact with bmal1/clock.

the interaction of mammalian cry proteins with bmal <dig>  clock, and per <dig> proteins in mouse was investigated using either a yeast two-hybrid or co-immunoprecipitation assays  <cit> . to test the feasibility of the mammalian two-hybrid system for the investigation of clock protein-protein interactions, the cdna of mcry <dig> was cloned into pact, where it was fused with vp <dig>  and cdnas of mclock, mper <dig>  and mbmal <dig> were cloned into pbind, where they were fused with gal <dig> . then, pact-mcry <dig> and pbind-mper <dig>  pbind-bmal <dig>  or pbind-mclock were transfected into hek 293t cells. co-expression of vp16-mcry <dig>  either with gal4-mbmal <dig> or gal4-mper <dig>  yielded comparable levels of luciferase activity . the co-expression vp16-mcry <dig> with gal4-mclock, compared with the proper controls, resulted in no luciferase activity, which indicates that these two proteins do not physically interact within the cell . to see if this result is not due to an expression problem, we carried out western blot analysis to detect expression levels of mcry <dig> and mclock. as shown in fig. 1b, both proteins are expressed at comparable level. these results are consistent with previously published results  <cit> , but recent studies have shown the interaction between cry <dig> and clock using co-immunoprecipitation  <cit> . it is possible that this interaction is only able to occur upon complex formation rather than being based solely on physical interaction between these two proteins. to eliminate the possibility that the interactions of the clock proteins observed in the mammalian two-hybrid system are due to the binding and activation domains of the vectors, the cdnas of the clock genes were also cloned into reciprocal vectors. after the transfection of various combinations of constructs into hek 293t cells, comparable levels of luciferase activity were measured using the same amounts of dna, in accordance with previous data .

we separated mcry <dig> into their c- and n-termini   <cit>  by pcr and the two domains were cloned into pact, thus fusing both cry domains with the vp <dig> domain . based on the luciferase activity, the photolyase homology region  domain of mcry <dig>  did not interact with mper <dig>  but did interact with mbmal <dig> . these data are consistent with a previous study  <cit> . these findings indicate that mammalian two-hybrid is appropriate to identify the domains and perhaps amino acids that play critical roles in protein-protein interactions.

identification of the region on mcry <dig> proteins that interact with mper2
we wanted to identify the amino acid in mcry <dig> that are important for binding to mper <dig>  for this purpose, we cloned mcry <dig> constructs that had been generated by deletion of the c-terminus in multiples of  <dig> amino acids. truncation of mcry <dig> was carried out by pcr and pcr products were cloned into the pact vector. the resulting constructs were named pact-mcry2-t <dig> , pact-mcry2-t <dig> , pact-mcry2-t <dig> , pact-mcry2-t <dig> , and pact-mcry2-t <dig>  . mammalian two-hybrid showed that vp16-mcry2-t <dig> yielded no luciferase activity when co-expressed with gal4-mper <dig> . to ensure that this lack of activity was not an artifact of reduced expression of the proteins, the samples were subjected to western blot analysis. western blot analysis of cell lysates from hek 293t cells that transiently expressed flag- tagged gal4-mper <dig> and ha- tagged vp16-mcry2-t1/t2/t3/t4/t <dig> revealed proteins of the expected molecular weight at comparable levels . hence, we conclude that the region between  <dig> and  <dig> of mcry2-t <dig> is responsible for the interaction with mper <dig>  then, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays as a supportive method. hek 293t cells were transiently transfected with pact-mcry2-t4/pbind-mper <dig>  pbind-mper <dig>  and pact-mcry2-t5/pbind-mper <dig>  mper <dig> was immunoprecipitated with flag antibodies as seen in fig. 3c. flag-tagged mper <dig> proteins pulled down ha-tagged mcry2-t <dig>  but flag-tagged mper <dig> proteins did not pull down ha-tagged mcry2-t <dig> protein. as seen in fig. 3c, mcry2-t <dig> was in the flow through. other bands of molecular weights different than the expected size of cry <dig> s were non-specific bands that were observed in the flag-mper <dig> proteins or flag resin that passed through the hek 293t cell-free extract. the results of mammalian two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays show that the region between 493- <dig> amino acids of mcry <dig> proteins is required for the interaction with mper <dig> protein. additionally, we have tested the interaction between mbmal <dig> and truncated mcry <dig> constructs. we have shown that the absence of the region 493- <dig> amino acids did not prevent the bmal1-mcry <dig> interaction . this indicates that these two amino acids are important only to interact with the mper <dig> and do not interfere with the interaction mcry2-mbmal <dig>  in fact, the region between  <dig> and  <dig> of mcry <dig> are located in the corresponding coiled-coil region of mcry <dig> , which was previously proposed as the interaction region of mcry <dig> with mper <dig> proteins  <cit> .

identification of amino acid residues of mcry <dig> that mediate interaction with mper2
to identify the amino acid residues of mcry2-t <dig> that interact with mper <dig>  we prepared degenerate oligos for  <dig> amino acids in the region between  <dig> and  <dig>  we carried out pcr using pact-mcry2-t <dig> as the template. after cloning mutants into the pact vector,  <dig> colonies were randomly selected. mutants were subjected to mammalian two-hybrid to examine the effect of mutated amino acids at various positions . many mutants had comparable levels of luciferase activity with respect to wildtype, while some mutants did not yield luciferase activity at all . these mutant constructs were sequenced to identify the mutations. interestingly, only constructs that had mutations in either arg <dig> or lys <dig> or both abolished luciferase activity. these results suggested that arg <dig> and lys <dig>  located in the  <dig> amino acid region between  <dig> and  <dig>  are important for interaction with mper <dig>  thus, we performed conservation analysis on these residues using clustal w <dig>  we observed that the predicted coiled-coil region has a high degree of conservation and these two amino acids within this region are fully conserved even in less related species . this analysis reveals the importance of these two amino acids for per <dig> and cry <dig> interaction. to assess whether these two amino acids of mcry <dig> are solely responsible for interaction with mper <dig>  we replaced arg <dig> and lys <dig> in full-length mcry <dig> cdna with gln and arg, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. as shown by the mammalian two-hybrid results, there was no interaction between mutant mcry <dig> and mper <dig> when compared with wildtype mcry <dig> and mper <dig> . to ensure that differential expression did not prevent the detection of luciferase activity, the samples were subjected to western blot analysis using anti-ha and anti-flag antibodies for mcry <dig> and mper <dig>  respectively. as shown in fig.  <dig>  all cdna that were transfected into hek 293t cells was comparably expressed, which verifies that all proteins were expressed at comparable levels. we hypothesized that if arg <dig> and lys <dig> residues of mcry <dig> are important for interaction with mper <dig> proteins, one would expect that over-expression of mutant mcry <dig> would not inhibit clock-bmal1-driven transcription  <cit> . expression of psg-mper1-luc plasmid  alone resulted in a 10-fold increase luciferase activity compared with the blank. this is because the endogenous clock protein binds the per <dig> promoter of the psg-mper1-luc construct and induces expression of luciferase. next, we transfected psg-mper1-luc/pact- mcry <dig> and psg-mper1-luc/pact-mcry2-mut into hek 293t cells to assess the ability of mutant mcry <dig> to repress endogenous clock-bmal1-mediated transcription from the mper <dig> promoter, which was fused with the luciferase gene in psg-mper1-luc. we observed that over-expression of wildtype mcry <dig> totally suppressed clock-bmal1-driven transcription. however, mutant mcry <dig> was unable to suppress clock-bmal1-driven transcription even though both wildtype and mutant mcry <dig> were expressed at comparable levels . in order to see this result is not due to the aberrant nuclear translocation of mutant cry <dig>  we performed immunocytochemistry under the same conditions with ha antisera and fitc conjugated secondary antibodies. as shown in figure 6b, both mutant and wild type cryptochromes were indeed localized in the nucleus. we further analyzed the repression of clock/bmal1-driven transcription using gal <dig> responsive promoter using mammalian two-hybrid system  <cit> . both mutant and wild type mcry <dig> were cloned into pegfp-n <dig> vector. plasmid constructs that have been used in this assay are shown in additional file  <dig>  the over-expression of egfp fused wild type mcry <dig> repressed the clock-bmal1-mediated luciferase activity, whereas egfp fused mutant mcry <dig> exhibited significantly reduced repressive effect in nih3t <dig> cells . to test the effects of mutations on the subcellular localization of mcry <dig>  egfp fused mutant and wildtype mcry <dig> are expressed nih3t <dig> cell line and subjected to the fluorescent microscopic analysis. it was shown that gfp localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm when pegfp vector alone is expressed in nih3t <dig> cells. since gfp is a small protein it can passively diffuse into nucleus. on the other hand both mutant and wild type cry <dig> fused with gfp, localized only in the nucleus . we have observed that both wildtype and mutant mcry <dig> were localized to the nucleus. this result is consistent with the result obtained using mper <dig> promoter with e-box. based on the kobayashi et al. , pkrk motif in the c-terminus is required for the nuclear localization of mcry <dig> and is enough for the nuclear localization of nls-gfp construct  <cit> . r501q/k503r mutations do not seem to affect this nls sequence and nuclear localization patterns of these proteins . therefore the inability of mutant mcry <dig> to suppress transcription is not due to impaired nuclear accumulation of mcrys as both mutant and wildtype mcry <dig> localized to the nucleus. thus, we conclude that arg <dig> and lys <dig> of mcry <dig> are not only necessary for interacting with mper <dig> but are also essential for suppressing clock/bmal <dig> activity. this finding suggests the potential for rational drug design to inhibit cryptochrome for specific therapeutic approaches  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our work shows that arg- <dig> and lys- <dig> of mcry <dig> are required not only for interaction with mper <dig> but are also important for the suppression of bmal1-clock-mediated transcription. our results identify the amino acid residues of mcry <dig> that interact with the mper <dig> binding region and may help to identify the new genetically inherited circadian abnormalities in humans.
