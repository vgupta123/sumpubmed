BACKGROUND
regulated mrna decay is a key factor in determining the expression pattern of many genes including those encoding for cytokines, proto-oncogenes, cell cycle regulators, and growth factors  <cit> . adenylate-uridylate-rich elements , present in the 3'-untranslated region  of many inherently labile mrnas, are the most widespread and best characterized destabilizing sequences  <cit> . impairment of the are-mediated mrna decay results in abnormal cell proliferation and angiogenesis, leading to cancer insurgence and progression  <cit> , as well as in inflammatory diseases such as crohn-like inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory arthritis  <cit> .

the interaction of regulatory proteins, are-binding proteins , with their target labile mrnas determines the half-life  of these transcripts. some are-bps are decay-promoting factors   <cit> . others, such as hur, are stabilizing factors, whereas auf <dig> mainly promotes decay although certain isoforms might be stabilizers of are-containing mrnas  <cit> . according to the recently proposed recruitment model, destabilizing are-bps, recruit the enzymatic degradation machinery to their target mrnas  <cit> .

we and others have recently reported that ksrp promotes rapid decay of several are-containing mrnas both in vitro and in vivo and that extracellular stimuli regulate its activity  <cit> . we have shown that activation of either wnt/β-catenin pathway in αt3- <dig> cells  <cit>  or mapk p <dig> signaling in c2c <dig> myoblasts  <cit>  selectively regulates the stability of specific sets of labile mrnas targeting ksrp. more recently, we demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt  signaling activation induces stabilization and enhances the steady-state levels of β-catenin mrna in pituitary αt3- <dig> cell line through phosphorylation and functional inactivation of ksrp  <cit> . pi3k-akt signaling exerts a central role in metabolism, cell survival, motility, transcription and cell-cycle progression .

it has been recently suggested that control of mrna decay is utilized by the cell to coordinate the expression of genes involved in specific processes leading to the notion of 'post-transcriptional operons'  <cit> . this would allow multiple genes to be co-regulated by a similar array of rna-binding proteins in response to certain stimuli. on this basis, we hypothesized that pi3k-akt activation could regulate the expression of transcripts additional to β-catenin by targeting ksrp. according to this hypothesis, a subset of ksrp target transcripts should be stabilized in response to pi3k-akt signaling.

to verify this hypothesis, we systematically searched, among the au-rich transcriptome, for ksrp target transcripts whose expression was upregulated by pi3k-akt signaling. we identified a set of labile mrnas, stabilized upon either ksrp knock-down or pi3k-akt activation, encoding signaling factors, rna binding proteins, and a replication-independent histone. these proteins could play a role in the cascade of cellular events initiated by pi3k-akt activation.

RESULTS
identification of ksrp target transcripts upregulated in cells expressing constitutively active myrakt1
we recently found by microarray analyses of the au-rich transcriptome that β-catenin mrna is stabilized and upregulated by pi3k-akt signaling in αt3- <dig> cells in a ksrp-regulated manner  <cit> . to systematically search for inherently labile transcripts whose expression is induced by pi3k-akt activation, we compared rna expression profiles of mock-transfected αt3- <dig> cells  to those of αt3- <dig> cells expressing a constitutively active akt <dig>  using the au-rich element-based cdna microarrays  <cit> . this array system contains approximately  <dig> cdna probes for are-containing mrnas and over  <dig> cdna probes for non-are mrnas and control housekeeping genes . for each cell line we obtained expression profiles from two independent rna samples. as shown in table  <dig>  we identified  <dig> transcripts at least twofold overrepresented in αt3-1-myrakt <dig> when compared to mock-αt3- <dig> cells. among these, β-catenin mrna has been previously reported and characterized . all the identified transcripts display ares in their 3'utr and encode proteins belonging to distinct functional categories .

in parallel, in order to identify mrna targets of ksrp in αt3- <dig> cells, we adopted the snaap technique  developed by kiledjian and coworkers  <cit>  using gst-fused ksrp as the affinity chromatography matrix. this technique allows to isolate only those mrnas for which the fusion protein of interest has a high affinity at the physiological salt concentrations in the context of a ribonucleoprotein complex  <cit> . the identification of ksrp-bound mrnas was performed by screening the au-rich element-based cdna microarrays  <cit> . sequence analysis performed on  <dig> ksrp-interacting mrnas identified by snaap , demonstrated over-representation of are motifs when compared to  <dig> non-ksrp target transcripts . eighty genes whose mrnas interacted with ksrp  were identified. thirteen of these mrnas  displayed a more than  <dig> fold enrichment  over the control gst matrix and were considered for further analysis . in order to select ksrp target transcripts whose expression is induced by pi3k-akt activation, we performed a comparative analysis of the results of the two screenings. we sorted out seven unanticipated mrnas that were both enriched upon snaap isolation and over-represented in αt3-1-myrakt <dig> cells . these transcripts encode three distinct rna binding proteins, hnrnpa <dig>  hnrnpf, and hnrnpa/b, three proteins implicated in cell signaling, the alpha stimulating subunit of guanine nucleotide binding protein , the alpha isoform of the catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase  <dig> , and the sh domain containing protein sorbin , as well as the replication-independent histone h <dig> a .

the are-containing regions of the novel ksrp target transcripts  displayed a potent destabilizing function both in vitro  and in intact cells . purified recombinant ksrp was able to bind, in a dose-response manner, to the ares of the novel ksrp targets in vitro . to validate the interaction of the endogenous ksrp with its target transcripts, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments of ribonucleoprotein complexes in αt3- <dig> cells. as shown in figure 1c, the seven transcripts were immunoprecipitated by anti-ksrp antibody as well as by anti-hnrnpa <dig> antibody. no ksrp target mrna was detected in anti-auf <dig> immunoprecipitates under standard experimental conditions . however, when the amount of cdnas obtained by retrotranscription and used in pcr reactions was increased by 10-fold, bands corresponding to hnrnpa/b and prothymosin α  mrnas  were detected . interestingly, also anti-hur antibody immunoprecipitated the ksrp target mrnas while anti-ttp antibody immunoprecipitated only hnrnpf and gnas  as well as gm-csf mrna which is a typical ttp target transcript . we obtained similar results performing immunoprecipitation of ribonucleoprotein complexes in c2c <dig> myoblasts .

ksrp associates with auf1p <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> in the cytoplasm of αt3- <dig> cells
hplc gel filtration of s <dig> extracts from αt3- <dig> cells followed by anti-ksrp immunoblotting analysis, showed that ksrp is present in fractions of molecular mass ranging from  <dig> kda to over- <dig> kda . we have previously demonstrated that ksrp functionally associates with components of the mrna decay machinery  <cit> . in order to identify ksrp molecular partners additional to those already known, a yeast two-hybrid screening using ksrp as a bait was performed. we identified several potential ksrp interacting proteins  including the chaperone protein 14-3-3ζ whose function in ksrp-dependent β-catenin mrna decay was recently described by gherzi et al.  <cit> . we found, among others, the cdnas encoding two bona fide are binding proteins, the p <dig> isoform of auf <dig>   <cit>  and hnrnpa <dig>  <cit> . both auf1p <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> elute together with ksrp in gel filtration fractions ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda . the interaction of either auf1p <dig> or hnrnpa <dig> with ksrp was confirmed by anti-ksrp immunoprecipitation of rnase a-treated αt3- <dig> cytoplasmic extracts followed by either anti-auf <dig> or anti-hnrnpa <dig> immunoblotting . gst-fused ksrp was able to pull-down both endogenous auf1p <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> from αt3- <dig> cytoplasmic extracts . these data, together with those presented in figure 1c suggest that ksrp target transcripts belong to a ribonucleoprotein complex including auf1p <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> 

we investigated whether either auf1p <dig> or hnrnpa <dig> or both directly interacted with ksrp target transcripts. uv-crosslinking experiments failed to display high affinity interaction of these are-bps with the ksrp target transcripts in vitro . this finding suggest that auf1p <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> are part of the ksrp-containing ribonucleoprotein complex but do not directly interact with ksrp targets.

ksrp knock-down in αt3- <dig> cells stabilizes ksrp target transcripts
to verify the relevance of ksrp in the decay control of its target transcripts, stable knock-down of ksrp using a short-hairpin vector was performed in αt3- <dig> cells . ksrp knock-down led to two- to five-fold increase of the steady-state levels of ksrp target mrnas in αt3-1-shksrp when compared to mock-transfected cells . no changes were seen with the control β2-mg rna levels . next, using actinomycin d, we analyzed the t1/ <dig> of the identified ksrp target mrnas in both mock-αt3- <dig> and αt3-1-shksrp cells. results presented in figure 3c showed that ksrp knock-down in αt3- <dig> cells strongly increased the t1/ <dig> of all the transcripts .

overall these data indicate that ksrp interacts with a subset of mrnas up-regulated in cells expressing constitutively active akt <dig> and regulates their stability and steady-state levels in αt3- <dig> cells.

pi3k-akt activation stabilizes ksrp target transcripts
we recently showed that pi3k-akt activation in αt3- <dig> cells stabilizes β-catenin mrna and induces its accumulation  <cit> . these events are mediated by ksrp phosphorylation and functional inactivation  <cit> . to investigate whether the activation of the pathway affects the stability of the novel ksrp targets, we took advantage of αt3-1-myrakt <dig> cells  <cit> . as shown in figure 4a, the kinase activity immunoprecipitated with anti-akt antibody was ~ <dig> fold higher in αt3-1-myrakt <dig> than in mock-αt3- <dig> cells thus demonstrating that active akt kinase was present in αt3- <dig> cells expressing myrakt <dig>  the steady-state levels of ksrp target mrnas were increased by  <dig> - <dig> fold in intact αt3-1-myrakt <dig> cells . in addition, the t1/ <dig> of the ksrp mrna targets was prolonged above  <dig> hours as a result of akt <dig> activation in αt3-1-myrakt <dig> cells .

since pi3k-akt signaling is known to be physiologically activated by insulin treatment , we investigated the effect of insulin treatment on the decay rates of ksrp target transcripts. insulin treatment of insulin receptor overexpressing hirc-b cells produced a strong activation of immunoprecipitated akt activity  and caused stabilization of ksrp targets in vitro .

notably, both the t1/ <dig> and steady-state levels of some of the ksrp targets , as exemplified by ptma, were not affected by pi3k-akt activation although increased by ksrp knock-down in αt3- <dig> cells .

altogether, these data indicate that activation of pi3k-akt signaling increased both the t1/ <dig> and the steady-state levels of a subset of ksrp target transcripts.

discussion
here we report that ksrp controls the half-life and the steady-state levels of a set of unanticipated labile mrnas in αt3- <dig> cells. the expression and the stability of the majority of these ksrp target transcripts is increased upon activation of pi3k-akt signaling. furthermore, we show that ksrp forms a ribonucleoprotein complex together with its target transcripts and the rna binding protein hnrnpa <dig> 

recently, we have shown that activation of pi3k-akt pathway induces ksrp-controlled regulation of β-catenin mrna in αt3- <dig> cells  <cit> . we hypothesized that pi3k-akt activation could prolong the t1/ <dig> of are-containing mrnas additional to β-catenin by targeting ksrp.

in order to identify transcripts whose t1/ <dig> and steady-state levels are controlled by ksrp and respond to pi3k-akt activation, we performed a comparative analysis of the au-rich transcriptome of αt3- <dig> cells focusing our attention onto ksrp target transcripts which are overrepresented in cells expressing a constitutively active akt <dig>  microarray-based methods have been successfully used to study global patterns of transcript decay and comprehensively identify targets of rna-binding proteins thus providing unique insights into gene expression programs  <cit> . we identified a set of mrnas that interact with ksrp and whose t1/ <dig> and steady-state levels are consistently increased by either ksrp knock-down or pi3k-akt activation. among these transcripts, three encode rna binding proteins mainly implicated in pre-mrna splicing events , three encode signaling molecules , and one encodes the replication-independent histone h <dig> a. to our best knowledge, none of these transcripts has been yet reported to undergo posttranscriptional control of its expression through regulation of mrna decay rates.

our present data  together with our previous observations  <cit>  indicate that ksrp interacts with a rather broad array of are-like sequences. the criteria used by ksrp to recognize its rna targets remain still unknown, and to date there are no reports that provide an explanation for its target recognition at the molecular level. our unpublished structural studies on ksrp domains  show a modularity of the interaction between k-homology  domains  <dig> and  <dig> that can increase the adaptability to different rna sequences/structures thus providing a possible explanation for the ability of ksrp to recognize highly heterogeneous rna targets. these data indicate that kh <dig> and kh <dig> can adapt to different au-rich sequences within the are without being limited by a rigid, pre-existing protein-protein interaction . this provides the protein with a flexible recognition unit than can adapt to different rna sequences and can mediate interactions in the structural environment of different 3'utrs.

pi3k-akt signaling has been reported to cause phosphorylation and activation of the sr-family members of splicing factors  <cit> . interestingly, hnrnpa <dig> has been shown to antagonize the splicing activity of sr proteins  <cit> . increased expression of hnrnpa <dig> could be viewed as a mean by which pi3k-akt signaling finely modulates select splicing events. intriguingly, hnrnpa <dig> transcript interacts with ksrp in the context of a complex that includes hnrnpa <dig> protein, thus suggesting the existence of an auto-regulatory loop.

gnas gene encodes the gsα that is required for hormone-stimulated camp generation  <cit> . recently, chen et al. demonstrated that gnas gene deletion causes increased insulin sensitivity targeting akt  <cit> . our data allow the hypothesis that akt could, in turn, regulate gsα expression and activity operating a negative feed back-control on insulin responsiveness.

protein phosphatase 2a  comprises a family of serine/threonine phosphatases, whose minimal component is a well conserved catalytic subunit . pp2a plays a prominent role in cell cycle regulation, cell morphology and development  <cit> . we have recently shown that pi3k-akt activation increases the expression of β-catenin by prolonging its mrna t through functional inactivation of ksrp. intriguingly, pp2a can de-phosphorylate β-catenin thus preventing its degradation and, therefore, it has been proposed as an activator of β-catenin signaling  <cit> . therefore pi3k-akt, inducing stabilization of the two ksrp target transcripts β-catenin and pp2aca, could enhance the cellular levels of β-catenin protein operating a combinatorial positive control. on the other hand, either inhibition or disruption of pp2a complexes leads to akt activation  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that pp2aca mrna stabilization and enhanced expression could operate a negative feed-back on the effects of either exaggerate or inappropriate pi3k-akt signaling activation  <cit> . a potential model for ksrp-mediated control of pi3k-akt/β-catenin signaling is presented in additional file  <dig> 

sorbs <dig>  the human gene that encodes sorbin, was mapped to the locus which is a candidate region for insulin resistance found in pima indians  <cit> . cap, the mouse homologue of sorbin, is a cytoskeletal adaptor protein involved in modulating adhesion-mediated signaling events that lead to cell migration  <cit> . it has been shown that stable cell lines overexpressing cap exhibit a reduced growth rate  <cit> . recently, katsanakis and pillay showed that akt phosphorylates the aps protein, a key factor in the signaling events that involve cap  <cit> . our data support the existence of an additional point of cross-talk between pi3k-akt signaling and the sorbin/cap pathway in insulin signaling.

variations in the expression of histone h <dig> a, a cell cycle-independent replacement histone, during differentiation of murine erithroleukemia cells, has been hypothesized to depend on post-transcriptional regulatory events  <cit> . although histone h <dig> a expression regulation has not been reported to be controlled by pi3k-akt signaling, it has been correlated to cell transformation and differentiation  <cit> .

further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the functional role, if any, of the coordinated decay control of the identified transcripts by pi3k-akt signaling under different physiological and pathological conditions.

our data indicate that ksrp interacts with auf1p <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> in the cytoplasm of αt3- <dig> cells. only one of the pi3k-akt-regulated ksrp targets, hnrnpa/b, is very weakly immunoprecipitated by anti-auf <dig> antibody . conversely, anti-hnrnpa <dig> antibody efficiently immunoprecipitates ksrp target transcripts . both auf1p <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> bind very weakly to the same rnas in vitro . hnrnpa <dig> has been implicated in many aspects of mrna maturation, transport, turnover and in telomere and telomerase regulation  <cit> . hamilton et al.  <cit>  reported that hnrnpa <dig> interacts with are-containing mrnas and suggested a role for this factor in are-mediated decay. our findings allow to hypothesize that auf1p <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> play some, yet unidentified, regulatory role in the ribonucleoprotein complex that includes ksrp and its target transcripts. we can hypothesize that, in response to certain stimuli, the two ksrp-interacting are-bps could acquire high affinity binding for target mrnas thus either potentiating or terminating the decay-promoting activity of ksrp on the same transcripts.

the mrna stability promoting factor hur interacts with ksrp target transcripts both in vitro  and in intact cells . we have previously reported that the balanced interaction of ksrp and hur to common sets of transcripts could allow a fine tuning of mrna decay regulation upon specific stimuli  <cit> . similar results were obtained by linker et al.  <cit> . our present data further support the idea that complex interactions in the are-bp network are required to ensure accurate regulation of the t1/ <dig> of select transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified several ksrp target mrnas that are overrepresented upon activation of pi3k-akt signaling. the interaction of ksrp with these transcripts was validated in vitro and in intact cells. importantly, both ksrp knock-down and pi3k-akt activation were found to increase the stability and the steady-state levels of these target mrnas. our findings provide comprehensive and valuable insight into the ksrp-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes that govern gene expression at the posttranscriptional level.
