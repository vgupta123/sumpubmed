BACKGROUND
aquaculture plays an increasingly important role in providing sustainable seafood products and has significantly outpaced capture fisheries in the past several decades  <cit> . tilapias are among the most important farmed fishes, and tilapia production continues to expand exponentially across the globe  <cit> . an important aspect of commercial production is the control of sexual differentiation. males grow to market-size earlier than females. females also start to reproduce at a smaller size, filling production ponds with small fish  <cit> . it is therefore advantageous to grow-out only male fish. at one time, all-male populations were produced through interspecific crosses  <cit> , but the strains supporting this technology have been lost or contaminated. currently, the standard way of achieving all male or nearly all male tilapia populations is via hormonal masculinization  <cit> . a reliable way of producing genetically all-male tilapia would allow the replacement of hormonal masculinization, which is banned in several major producing countries . it is therefore important to understand the genetic basis of sex determination in current aquaculture stocks.

sex determination in tilapias is largely genetic, although environmental factors also play a role . in nile tilapia , distinct xy sex determining loci have been identified on both linkage group   <dig> and lg <dig>  <cit> . the closely related blue tilapia  segregates both an xy locus on lg <dig>  and an epistatically dominant zw locus on lg <dig>  <cit> . additional sex determining loci have been identified on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in closely related species of east african cichlid . as a group, tilapias and related species of other cichlid fishes are a promising model system for understanding the gene network controlling sex determination in vertebrates.

work to identify the genes underlying each of these sex determiners has been hampered by the incomplete nature of previous draft genome assemblies, and by the discovery that many of these sex determiners are located in large blocks of highly differentiated, and sometimes repetitive sequence. to date, the molecular genetic basis for sex determination in cichlids has been determined for only the lg <dig> xy locus in o. niloticus  <cit> .

although several draft genome sequences are available for cichlids, these are mostly based on short illumina sequencing reads  <cit> . the previous o. niloticus assembly was produced using ~277x coverage of illumina reads from several libraries including a 40kbp scaffolding library. recently duplicated and highly repetitive sequences are typically collapsed in these assemblies  <cit> . indeed some of the most interesting and perhaps evolutionarily important regions of the genome may be the most difficult to assemble accurately. recently duplicated regions are notoriously difficult to assemble due to their repeat length and high sequence identity  <cit> . the repetitive “dark-matter” part of the genome is vastly underrepresented in the majority of current genome assemblies  <cit> . attempts to assemble these regions using only short read sequencing are futile  <cit> . only long sequencing reads will produce more contiguous and complete assemblies of complex vertebrate genomes . the importance of such high quality assemblies for downstream applications cannot be overemphasized.

here we report a new assembly of the tilapia genome from long pacbio sequence reads. this assembly contains much of the missing sequence from previous assemblies, and is among the most contiguous vertebrate genome assemblies to date. we use this new assembly to further characterize the tilapia sex determining loci previously identified on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> 

RESULTS
assembly overview
a homozygous clonal xx female tilapia individual  <cit>  was chosen for genome sequencing. the individual was sequenced to 44x coverage using pacbio sequencing of  <dig> smrt cells using the p6-c <dig> chemistry. this yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads with a mean subread length of  <dig>  bp and n <dig> read length of  <dig>  bp.

an overview of the assembly process is outlined in fig.  <dig>  to summarize,  <dig> candidate de novo assemblies were generated using both the falcon  <cit>  and canu  <cit>  genome assembly packages. multiple parameters were adjusted for both algorithms to tune the assemblies. the error correction steps of both algorithms include parameters that control alignment seed length, read length, overlap length and error rates .fig.  <dig> assembly overview. flowchart detailing the processing of the raw 44x pacbio sequencing reads, producing candidate assemblies, polishing, breaking, and final assembly anchoring. metrics are provided at each step




evaluating assemblies
the  <dig> candidate assemblies were evaluated using a number of different metrics, techniques and complementary datasets. first, each of the candidate assemblies was evaluated using ale assembly likelihood estimates  <cit>   based on alignment of the reads from four separate illumina libraries and of the 44x pacbio dataset . candidate assemblies were also evaluated for completeness using cegma  <cit>  and busco  <cit>  core gene sets, as well as by aligning existing o. niloticus refseq  <cit>  transcripts. a set of  <dig>  bac-end sequences  <cit>  representing ~29x physical clone coverage were used to assess the longer range accuracy of candidate assemblies. finally, both a physical radiation-hybrid  map consisting of  <dig>  markers  <cit>  and a rad-seq genetic map consisting of  <dig>  markers  <cit>  were used to estimate the number of misassemblies present in each of the candidate assemblies. the results of these analyses are provided in additional file  <dig> 

ranking assemblies
no single candidate assembly ranked the highest for all of the evaluation metrics that were computed. principal component analysis  was used to reduce the various assembly evaluation metrics and compare the candidate assemblies. additional file  <dig> shows that the canu assemblies tend to cluster separately from the falcon assemblies in the pca space. the total assembly size and number of refseq exons mapped explained the largest amount of variance and were correlated. these two metrics did not seem like the most important metrics to base the evaluation upon since assembly parameters could be tuned to change the total size and the estimated genome size was  <dig> gbp  <cit> .

the ale likelihood scores explain the next largest proportion of the variance. the  <dig> candidate assemblies were ranked by overall ale scores for each of the five sequencing libraries. an average of the ale ranks was then calculated. the canu assembly  that was chosen as the best among the  <dig> candidate assemblies showed the best average ale ranks. in addition, canu assembly # <dig> had one of the best rates of properly mapped bac-end sequences, and possessed among the fewest misassemblies as determined by conflicts with the rh and rad map data . these results suggest that canu assembly # <dig> has the best long-range accuracy while maintaining comparable short-range accuracy.

polishing
a relatively small number of sequence errors remained in the intermediate unpolished canu # <dig> assembly. to correct these errors, first the raw 44x pacbio reads were aligned to the canu assembly and quiver was used to polish the assembly at  <dig> , <dig> sites . quiver corrected  <dig> , <dig>  insertions,  <dig>   substitutions and  <dig>   deletions. next, four illumina libraries, totaling 277x coverage, were aligned to the intermediate quiver-polished assembly. based upon these alignments, pilon polished an additional  <dig> , <dig> sites. pilon corrected  <dig> , <dig>  insertions,  <dig>   substitutions, and  <dig>   deletions.

detection of misassemblies
the polished intermediate assembly showed high accuracy at the level of individual bases and with respect to the placement of paired-end sequences from ~150kbp bacs . however,  <dig> putative inter-chromosomal misassemblies were identified by alignment to the rh and rad maps. the rh and rad maps both identified  <dig> of these inter-chromosomal misassemblies. the rad map identified an additional  <dig> putative misassemblies that were not identified using the rh map , while the rh map identified an additional  <dig> misassemblies that were not identified using the rad map . the regions around each putative misassembly were inspected using the genomic resources already mentioned. each had a characteristic signature consisting of a high density of variants in the 44x pacbio read alignments, as well as low or zero physical coverage of the 40kbp insert illumina mate-pair library. an example of these misassembly signatures is shown in additional file  <dig> 

genome wide analysis of the intermediate assembly for each of these characteristic signatures detected  <dig> regions of high-density pacbio variants and  <dig> regions of low physical coverage in the 40kbp mate-pair library.  <dig> regions had both a high-density of pacbio variants and low physical 40kbp mate-pair coverage. nine of these regions showed correct alignment to both maps and therefore were not included in the set of putative misassemblies. however, two of these regions were identified by the pacbio variants and low 40kbp physical coverage in regions where there were no markers in either the rh or rad map and added to the  <dig> map-based misassemblies giving a total of  <dig> sites of likely misassembly. table  <dig> provides a summary of the putative misassemblies that were identified by the maps and sequence alignment methods.table  <dig> number of putative misassemblies identified by various methods




analysis of the repetitive elements within these regions revealed that misassembly locations were enriched for highly repetitive interspersed and nested repeats. we examined the region ~75kbp on both sides of the likely misassembly breakpoints and found that  <dig> % of these regions were classified as repetitive . these regions were enriched for several te families. table  <dig> shows the enrichment of the most common repeats and tes within the misassembly regions. in each of these cases, the mean length of these repeats was longer within the misassembly regions. some of the same te families that are abundant across the whole genome  are also present in high frequency in the misassembly regions. however, some te families that occurred in relatively low frequency across the whole genome  are highly enriched in the misassembly regions.table  <dig> repeats in putative misassembly regions compared to the whole genome




anchoring
table  <dig> provides the anchored size of each lg, including gaps. the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly anchored  <dig> mbp of the total genome , which is 211mbp  more than was anchored in the previous “orenil <dig> ” assembly   <cit> . when gaps are not counted, the amount of anchored, non-gap, sequence is 864mbp  compared to 606mbp  in the previous orenil <dig>  assembly. lg <dig> is the largest anchored lg , which agrees with cytogenetic studies that show lg <dig> as the largest and most repetitive chromosome in the o. niloticus genome  <cit> . cytogenetic studies also indicate that lg <dig> is the second largest chromosome in the o. niloticus genome, and lg <dig> is the second largest anchored lg in the new “o_niloticus_umd1” assembly.table  <dig> size of each anchored linkage group for both the previous assembly, orenil <dig>   <cit>  and the new assembly 




assembly completeness
to determine the completeness of the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly, the assembly was compared against two established sets of core vertebrate gene sets. table  <dig> shows the number of the  <dig> cegma and the  <dig>  busco conserved vertebrate genes that were identified in the new assembly. the number of conserved genes identified increased for both the cegma and busco gene sets. the number of complete single-copy buscos increased by  <dig> , while the number of complete duplicated buscos increased by  <dig> . the number of missing buscos decreased by  <dig>  in the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly compared to the orenil <dig>  assembly.table  <dig> genome completeness as measured by cegma and busco




annotation
the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly was annotated using the ncbi refseq automated eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline. this same pipeline was previously used to annotate the orenil <dig>  assembly. several additional, new transcriptome datasets  were available to annotate the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly that were not available during the orenil <dig>  annotation process. a comparison of both genome assembly annotations is provided in table  <dig>  the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly contains  <dig>  more gene and pseudogene annotations than the orenil <dig>  assembly . similarly, the number of mrna annotations increased markedly by  <dig>  . the number of partial mrna annotations decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . cds annotations also increased overall . the refseq annotation pipeline makes corrections to cds annotations that contain premature stop-codons, frameshifts and internal gaps that would disrupt protein sequence coding. these corrections are based on transcriptome data and corrected  <dig> cdss in o_niloticus_umd <dig> compared to  <dig> previously for orenil <dig>  . the number of non-coding rnas more than doubled in the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly .table  <dig> refseq annotation summary




o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly summary
table  <dig> provides summary statistics for the previous o. niloticus assembly , each intermediate of the new assembly, and our new final assembly . the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly is more contiguous, with 45% fewer contigs than the number of scaffolds in orenil <dig> . the overall size of the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly is  <dig> gbp compared to 927mbp of orenil <dig> . the o_niloticus_umd <dig> contains only  <dig> gaps that were introduced in the anchoring step. these anchoring gaps amount to  <dig> mbp  due entirely to the arbitrary 10kbp gaps placed between anchored contigs. this compares to  <dig> mbp  of gaps in orenil <dig> . overall,  <dig> mbp of new sequence has been assembled in o_niloticus_umd <dig> that was either previously in gaps or not assembled at all in orenil <dig> .table  <dig> summary statistics for the various assemblies




repeat content
the te and repeat portion of the genome is vastly under underrepresented in most genome assemblies  <cit> . the use of long pacbio reads allowed for the assembly of more of the repetitive regions of the o. niloticus genome. 379mbp  of the total o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly was annotated as repetitive. table  <dig> provides a summary of the repeat and te families that were most abundant in the assembly. the new assembly includes an additional 146mbp  of repetitive sequence that was either hidden in gaps or not present at all in the previous assembly. the entire repeat catalog is provided in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> summary of repeat families




figure  <dig> provides a comparison of the repeat landscape of the orenil <dig>  and o_niloticus_umd <dig> assemblies. most notably, recently inserted  tes have been assembled in far greater number in the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly. the overall number of repetitive elements increased at all divergence levels , with most at lower divergences . figure  <dig> suggests that te insertions less than 1% diverged are still underrepresented in the assembly.fig.  <dig> repeat landscape comparison. the percentage of both the orenil <dig>  and o_niloticus_umd <dig> and assemblies that each te family is represented at in particular substitution levels analogous to the age of tes 




satellite regions represent one of the most highly repetitive regions of the genome and are often associated with centromeric and heterochromatic regions. two tilapia-specific satellite repeats have been previously described. onsata is a 209 bp repeat unit and shows variability between related tilapiine species  <cit> . only  <dig> copies of onsata  were assembled and annotated in the original orenil <dig>  assembly. in the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly,  <dig> regions of onsata comprising a total of  <dig> ,985 bp were assembled and annotated. many of the onsata regions, the longest of which was  <dig>  bp on the unanchored contig <dig>  were composed of multiple, nested onsata copies. onsatb is a  <dig>  bp repeat unit that is organized in tandem arrays and appears to be more conserved and perhaps under selective constraint  <cit> .  <dig> copies of onsatb  were assembled and annotated in the original orenil <dig>  assembly. in the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly,  <dig>  copies of onsatb  were assembled and annotated. again, many of the onsatb regions were composed of multiple onsatb copies, the longest of which was  <dig>  bp located near the beginning of lg <dig> .

tes specific to african cichlid species have been previously sequenced and used as molecular markers to study evolutionary history and phylogenetics of african cichlids  <cit> . some of these african cichlid specific or “afc” lines and sines had been previously assembled and annotated in the orenil <dig>  assembly. an additional  <dig> mbp of afc-specific te sequence was annotated in the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly. this  <dig> mbp increase was assembled across  <dig> fewer afc te copies, which resulted in longer mean length afc te copies. this suggests that the previous assembly contained many fragmented afc specific te copies.

recently duplicated regions
recently duplicated genes are notoriously difficult to assemble due to their high sequence identity  <cit> . using short illumina reads to assemble these regions is a difficult task even with mate-pair sequence data across multiple spatial scales. in a previous study of the tilapia vasa gene, we identified three partial gene sequences in the orenil <dig>  assembly  <cit> . we then screened a tilapia bac library for vasa gene sequences and identified three bac clones containing vasa sequences. the three clones came from separate restriction fingerprint contigs  <cit> , and represent duplications of the ancestral vasa gene. sanger sequencing identified a full-length vasa gene in each of these bac clones. figure 3a shows how the previous orenil <dig>  assembly failed to correctly assemble any of the three vasa gene copies. figure 3b indicates how these genes were assembled from each of the bac clones. figure 3c details how the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly correctly assembles the three copies of the vasa gene corresponding to the three bac clones.fig.  <dig> 
vasa gene duplication. a the top row shows the vasa transcript  aligned to orenil <dig>  assembly scaffolds with gaps shown in solid red. b the middle row shows this same vasa transcript aligned to the separate bac assemblies . c the bottom row shows the vasa transcript aligned to o_niloticus_umd <dig> lgs. for each row there are three alignments corresponding to the three copies of each vasa transcript




sex determination regions
the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly was used to study sequence differentiation across two sex-determining regions in tilapias. the first region is an xx/xy sex-determination region on lg <dig> found in many strains of tilapia . we previously characterized this region by whole genome illumina re-sequencing of pooled dna from males and females  <cit> . we realigned these sequences to the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly and searched for variants that were fixed in the xx female pool and polymorphic in the xy male pool. figure  <dig> shows the fst and the sex-patterned variant allele frequencies for the xx/xy o. niloticus comparison across the complete orenil <dig>  and o_niloticus_umd <dig> assemblies, while fig.  <dig> focuses on the highly differentiated ~9mbp region on lg <dig> with a substantial number of sex-patterned variants, indicative of a reduction in recombination in a sex determination region that has existed for some time  <cit> .fig.  <dig> whole genome o. niloticus sex comparison. a fst comparison of xx female pool versus xy male pool on orenil <dig> . b sex-patterned variants across orenil <dig> . c fst comparison of xx female pool versus xy male pool on o_niloticus_umd <dig>  d sex-patterned variants across o_niloticus_umd1

the second sex comparison is for an zz/wz sex-determination region on lg <dig> in a strain of o. aureus  <cit> . this region has not previously been characterized using whole genome sequencing. for this comparison we identified variant alleles fixed in the zz male pool and polymorphic in the wz female pool. figure  <dig> shows the fst and the sex-patterned variant allele frequencies for this comparison across the whole o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly, while fig.  <dig> focuses on the differentiated region on lg <dig>  o. aureus lg <dig> contains a large ~50mbp region of differentiated sex-patterned variants, also indicative of a reduction in recombination in the sex determination region. figure  <dig> also shows this differentiation pattern on several other lgs . it is possible that these smaller regions of sex-patterned differentiation are actually translocations in o. aureus relative to the o. niloticus genome assembly.fig.  <dig> whole genome o. aureus sex comparison. a fst comparison of zw female pool versus zz male pool on orenil <dig> . b sex-patterned variants across orenil <dig> . c fst comparison of zw female pool versus zz male pool on o_niloticus_umd <dig>  d sex-patterned variants across o_niloticus_umd1

discussion
genome assembly
we explored the parameter space of both the falcon and canu genome assembly packages and produced  <dig> candidate assemblies . since the true sequence is not known, we had to deduce which of the candidate assemblies best represented the true sequence of the homozygous clone. we elected to assess the assemblies with a variety of metrics, and to select the assembly that scored well across all of the most important metrics.

the first metric is the overall size of the assembly, which should closely match the estimated size of the genome. the size of the o. niloticus genome has been measured by both feulgen densitometry and bulk fluorometric assay. five separate measurements range between  <dig> – <dig>  picograms or ~ <dig> – <dig> gbp  <cit> . the average genome size of these five estimates is  <dig> gbp. the various assemblies ranged in size from  <dig> mbp to  <dig> gbp. the assembly that was chosen  has a length of  <dig> gbp, which corresponds to  <dig> % of the estimated size of the genome.

the second set of metrics we considered were the standard measures of assembly contiguity such as ng <dig>  number of contigs, longest contig and mean contig size. the third set of metrics consisted of assembly likelihood  scores, which were calculated by aligning four illumina libraries  as well as the 44x pacbio library against each candidate assembly. the fourth metric measured the accuracy of the assemblies at larger scales by aligning the contigs to a ~29x clone coverage library of ~150kbp bac-end sequences  <cit>  and to existing genetic and physical maps of o. niloticus  <cit> . alignment of the rh and rad maps to the candidate assemblies indicated that every assembly had a relatively low and consistent number of misassemblies . the fifth metric assessed the completeness of each candidate genome assembly by looking for two core eukaryotic gene sets, cegma  <cit>  and busco  <cit> .table  <dig> 
o. niloticus illumina libraries used for ale calculations and pilon polishing




no candidate assembly ranked the best for all of these different metrics. in order to choose a preferred assembly, we used principal component analysis to organize the several scores for each assembly. the pca analysis showed a noticeable difference between the canu assemblies and the falcon assemblies . all of the canu assemblies clustered together in pca space. the falcon assemblies fell into two separate clusters because five of the falcon assemblies  had low ale scores and ng50s. the other falcon assemblies tended to show overall better ale scores for the 44x pacbio library than did the canu assemblies. this is due to differences in the consensus accuracy between canu and falcon assemblies. the 44x pacbio ale placement and insert scores were virtually the same across all candidate assemblies, but the 44x pacbio ale k-mer scores were lower for the canu assemblies. this suggests a slight difference in consensus between canu and falcon, although it is probably not noticeable after the polishing steps.

leaving aside the five low quality falcon assemblies, a major tradeoff in the pca is between the size of the assembly and the pacbio ale score. the falcon assemblies are all smaller than the canu assemblies, and for the reasons discussed above, have higher ale scores for the pacbio library. we elected to focus on the canu assemblies, where the major tradeoff is between the quality of the assembly  and size of the assembly . ultimately, we chose the assembly  with the best overall ale average rank. this assembly was  <dig> mbp shorter than the longest canu assembly .

alignment of the rh and rad maps to the candidate assemblies indicated that every assembly had a relatively similar and low number of misassemblies . to correct these misassemblies in the polished version of assembly # <dig>  the locations of misassemblies were first narrowed using the rh and rad map data together. this typically narrowed the location of a misassembly to a region of less than 1mbp. from there, the region around each misassembly breakpoint was inspected using alignments of the pacbio data, illumina data, refseq gene set, bac-end sequences as well as the repeatmasker annotations. a characteristic signal of high variation in the pacbio alignments, low physical coverage in the illumina libraries , and a high density of large and nested repeats was seen in each region of misassembly. regions of high variation in the pacbio alignments and low 40kbp physical coverage were then calculated genome-wide to investigate whether additional misassemblies might be hidden in the assembly. when considering the pacbio highly variant regions and the low physical 40kbp coverage regions individually, both sets over-estimated the number of misassembly regions. these false-positive potential misassemblies occurred in regions where there was support for correct and continuous assembly based on both rh and rad map alignments, which together lend stronger support. only in two cases were there regions that had high pacbio variation, low physical 40kbp coverage and no alignment of rh or rad map data. we decided to break the assembly at these two locations as well.

anchoring
a total of  <dig> mbp of the assembled contigs were anchored to the  <dig> lgs in o_niloticus_umd <dig>  overall, 258mbp of additional  sequence has been anchored in the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly . all but two of the o_niloticus_umd <dig> lgs  are larger in size than in the previous orenil <dig>  assembly. lg <dig> is  <dig> mbp smaller and lg <dig> is  <dig> mbp smaller. it is possible that the orenil <dig>  assembly correctly assembled more of these lg <dig> and lg <dig>  alternatively, the size difference could be due to overestimates of gap sizes in the orenil <dig>  assembly and/or incorrect assignment of contigs/scaffolds to the wrong lg, which have now been correctly assigned.

it should be noted that although two markers were required to anchor and orient any contig to a particular lg, not all of the markers in the rad map were located at distinct map positions . therefore, in some cases , the orientation of contigs on lgs is ambiguous. we chose to allow anchoring of these contigs to maximize the anchoring of the many small repetitive contigs that make up lg <dig> 

annotation
table  <dig> provides the refseq annotation summary of both the orenil <dig>  and new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assemblies. the increase in gene and pseudogene annotations is at least partly due to the fact that the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly contains an additional  <dig> mbp of sequence that was not present in orenil <dig>  as well as the fact that additional transcriptome reads were available for refseq annotation of o_niloticus_umd <dig>  these additional annotations include protein-coding genes , non-coding rnas  and pseudogenes . at the same time, there was a decrease in the number of partial mrna  and partial cds  annotations. this is most likely due to the fact that o_niloticus_umd <dig> gene annotations are not disrupted by assembly gaps. the remaining partial annotations may represent recent pseudogenes that the annotation pipeline has little way of differentiating.

the ncbi refseq annotation pipeline corrects cds annotations that have premature stop-codons, frameshifts and internal gaps that would disrupt protein- coding sequence. the refseq annotation pipeline corrected  <dig> cdss in o_niloticus_umd <dig> compared to  <dig> previously for orenil <dig> . these remaining  <dig> cds annotations that required corrections may be due to incomplete polishing in the final o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly, but this number is less than the amount of corrected cdss annotated in the smaller orenil <dig>  assembly.

repeats
the vast majority of te families are represented by more sequence in the new assembly . it is likely that the fragmented orenil <dig>  assembly caused there to be an inflated count of annotated te copies in places where gaps were inserted within te copies. the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly has assembled te families in longer overall copies than in orenil <dig>  it is also likely that having longer repeat copies and overall 146mbp more repeat sequence allowed for more accurate annotation of all repeat sequences. in turn, several te families  have decreased in overall number in the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly, which is likely due to these tes being more accurately annotated as different, but related tes. the most recent and less diverged te copies have been assembled in far greater number in the new o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly .

the two tilapia-specific satellite repeats, onsata  <cit>  and onsatb  <cit> , have been shown to be present in high copy number. both of these satellite repeats have previously been physically mapped using fluorescent in situ hybridization  in o. niloticus  <cit> . onsata was found almost solely in the centromeres, while onsatb was also scattered throughout the length of each chromosome arm. consistent with this, we found nested onsata repeat segments assembled near the very ends of several anchored chromosomes . onsatb nested repeat segments were found near one or both ends of several anchored chromosomes . these data suggest that our assembly of these chromosomes extend into the centromeres. these satellite nested repeats were also abundant in several of the misassembled regions  suggesting that they remain an obstacle to complete assembly of the genome.

recently duplicated regions
as the recent vasa gene duplication in o. niloticus  shows, the use of long reads has enabled the assembly of such recently duplicated regions. it is likely that there are many other recently duplicated regions that have now been assembled. this is supported by the genome completeness analysis with busco that showed there were  <dig> additional duplicated buscos out of  <dig> searched . even though this is a small percentage of the genes analyzed , when extrapolated over all the genes in the genome this would amount to hundreds of recently duplicated genes being assembled for the first time. the refseq annotation shows that the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly contained  <dig> additional pseudogenes , which also supports this notion.

sex determination regions
manipulation of sex-determination in tilapia has important economic implications. the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly was used to confirm the known and previously described o. niloticus ~9mbp sex-determination region on lg <dig>  <cit> . the size and pattern of sex differentiation on lg <dig> and across the genome is similar in both the orenil <dig>  and o_niloticus_umd <dig> assemblies . a total of  <dig> additional lg <dig> sex-patterned variants are identified in the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly.

the sex-determination region in o. aureus is located on the large and highly repetitive lg <dig>  due to the fact that lg <dig> is highly repetitive, it was poorly assembled in orenil <dig>  and the vast amount of sex-patterned variants were previously found on unanchored contigs and scaffolds . an additional  <dig>  lg3-specific o. aureus sex-patterned variants are identified in the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly. now that lg <dig> has been assembled and anchored into a much larger lg , many of these sex-patterned variants are confirmed on lg <dig> . there still exist a substantial number of sex-patterned variants on unanchored contigs in the new assembly. the overall pattern of o. aureus sex differentiation on lg <dig> is characterized by several sharp transitions between low and high differentiation . these sharp transitions may be explained by either errors in the anchoring process or structural differences between the reference species  and o. aureus. indeed, there are several peaks of differentiation on other lgs . these may also be chromosomal translocation differences between the two species that will need to be investigated further with fish.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a new assembly and annotation of the nile tilapia o. niloticus , which provides a high-quality reference for the cichlid research community as well as one for studying the evolution of vertebrate genomes. the study also serves as a template for vertebrate genome assembly with current technology and describes many of genomic features that can now be represented correctly. generation of o_niloticus_umd <dig> began by comparing candidate de novo assemblies systematically comparing them to select a single best assembly. a small number of misassemblies present in this candidate assembly were identified using several different datasets and subsequently corrected. the final anchored o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly remained very contiguous with a contig ng <dig> of  <dig> mbp and 86% of contigs anchored to lgs. the number of annotated genes increased  <dig> % from the previous assembly of o. niloticus. additionally, a vast amount of repetitive sequences  were added in the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly, many of which represent very recent tes. finally, the o_niloticus_umd <dig> assembly was used to better characterize two large sex-determination regions. the first is a ~9mbp region in o. niloticus and the second is a ~50mbp region in the related species o. aureus. further characterization of these sex-determination regions will have important economic implications for farmed tilapia.
