BACKGROUND
the most recent step forward in structural biology for characterizing large molecular assemblies is the integration of several complementary techniques to reach the goal of determining structures at atomic level. in this frame, it is essential to combine information from a variety of physical and chemical origins thus providing a solid basis to understanding molecular function. this recent development is known as integrative structural biology  <cit> .

among the different available techniques, small-angle x-ray scattering  presents unique advantages. saxs applied to dilute solutions of proteins is a long established technique in structural biology. it gives ensemble reciprocal space information on the size and shape of macromolecules . while the reconstruction of 3d models of proteins from solution scattering data is common, it is an ill-posed problem and typically requires additional constraints such as the maximal distance between two points in a sample d
max . saxs data is sensitive to oligomerization or aggregation of biological samples. for example, radiation-induced aggregation has been observed with saxs data for lysozyme, but without any change in folding topology  <cit> . irreversible x-ray induced damage, essentially due to free radical formation in the sample at synchrotron sources, are a current limitation of saxs experiments and often increase the amount of material needed  <cit>  or require radiation protectant such as glycerol or cryo-cooling  <cit> . however, evaluation of post-saxs experiment radiation damage on proteins is rarely performed because the allowable doses are highly sample-dependent, and must be determined on a case-by-case basis. a protocol to investigate such radiation damage at saxs beamline is suggested in this work and makes use of the imaging capability of the atomic force microscope at nanometer resolution.

atomic force microscopy  is beginning to make a large impact in the field of structural biology . afm uses a sharp tip located beneath a micro-cantilever that scans across sample molecules usually deposited on flat mineral substrates . it can give real space information about the size and shape of particles as well as their physical properties and behaviour in the measurement conditions. typically, topographical resolution can reach sub-nanometer range when characterizing flat samples  but it rises up to the nanometer range when measuring isolated biomolecules. the main advantage of afm resides in its exceptional signal-to-noise ratio where the imaging of a single isolated particle is enough to determine its particular dimensions using standard or improved image processing methods  <cit> . moreover, one of the main advantages of an afm over scanning electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy is that the sample can be kept in physiological conditions while imaging, such as a liquid buffer for proteins  <cit> , a shared advantage with the saxs technique. complementarity between saxs and afm techniques allows cross validation thereby increasing the reliability and confidence in the results, and to obtain additional information such as electrochemical properties of a macromolecule based on its binding with surfaces for afm images. however, to date there are only a few studies which combine these two techniques .

here, we describe a protocol for the combined acquisition of biosaxs and afm data from the same sample with minimum delay taking advantage of the esrf user facilities for both techniques. by using remaining  sample from the biosaxs acquisition and diluting it to the required concentration, depositing it onto an atomically flat surface for afm imaging, the afm data collection is achieved with no additional sample required over that needed for biosaxs. indeed, as little as  <dig> μl of the sample solution left in the sample changer was diluted  <dig> times to a concentration suitable for afm. with this method, the amount of solution leftover from saxs is sufficient for many afm images, which can be very useful in cases where each μl of solution takes large amounts of time and resources to produce. it is shown that afm is a useful tool to evaluate the effects of radiation damage by evaluating changes to physical characteristics and electrochemical behaviour of irradiated samples. such effects result in an increase of the apparent size or in a decrease of the average particle radius due to breakage. it is also shown that the afm output can be employed as a constraint to interpret saxs data, reducing ambiguity in the saxs output. to evaluate the performance of the afm-saxs combination, two standard systems have been used: β-amylase from sweet potato and the tobacco mosaic virus , a long rod shape plant virus.

methods
sample preparation

β-amylase is a tetrameric enzyme of ≈  <dig> kda which catalyzes the hydrolysis of maltose units  for starch. the known crystal structure of β-amylase   <cit>  was used for comparison with experimental data. according to the reconstituted tetrameric structure of β-amylase, the computed maximum bounding box of c α atoms has a size of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig>  nm  <dig> and a radius of gyration of  <dig>  nm . a  <dig>  mg/ml solution of β-amylase protein from sweet potato  was prepared by adding  <dig>  ml of tris equilibration buffer  and filtering with a  <dig>  μm filter. the final concentration was verified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer at od  <dig>   <cit> . for afm, the solution was further diluted in tris equilibration buffer without glycerol.

tmv forms a hollow rod-like structure of about  <dig> nm length and  <dig> nm diameter. the crystal structure of tmv was determined and refined by x-ray fiber diffraction  <cit> . the organization of tmv assembly has been widely studied using imaging techniques such as electron microscopy, afm, and x-ray microdiffraction , and it is a common model system for image processing  <cit> . the regularity of the tmv structure simplifies the comparison of results out of single-image analysis on afm images with those of other techniques. tmv particles were prepared as previously described  <cit> . the concentration was determined by spectrophotometric measurement at od  <dig>  at a value of  <dig> mg/ml. tmv dilution for afm and saxs was performed in deionized water.

small-angle x-ray scattering 
saxs data collection was performed on bm <dig> at the esrf  <cit> .  <dig> μl of sample solution was loaded into the automatic sample changer, with  <dig> μl used for the actual experiment. scattering data of samples and buffers was acquired at one frame per second for ten seconds while sample was flowing through the capillary using the flow mode of the automated sample changer  <cit> . for afm imaging of radiation damaged samples, the exposed samples were recuperated after exposure and followed the same protocol as the non exposed samples to facilitate comparison. the total flow time was  <dig> seconds. the x-ray beam energy was  <dig>  kev and the beam size was  <dig> ×  <dig> μm. the detector distance was  <dig>  m. data was collected at  <dig> °c. intensity was normalized to absolute units using background-corrected water. the available q-range  was  <dig>  nm − <dig> to  <dig>  nm − <dig>  data reduction was done using the standard tools at bm <dig> yielding the 1d subtracted curves and initial processing to give feedback to the experiment  <cit> . extrapolation to zero concentration and determination of the model independent parameters , i
 <dig> , molecular mass, etc.) and cross-sectional guinier analyis done using primus  <cit> . comparison of known structures to the experimental data  was done using oligomer  <cit> . fitting of geometric models  was done with genfit  <cit> . computation of model intensities was done using crysol  <cit>  while p   analysis and cross-section pair-distribution using gnom  <cit> .

radiation damage investigations were performed testing several irradiation times: 1) one second exposure, 2) standard exposure which corresponds to a total exposure of  <dig> s while flowing, 3)  <dig> min exposure, 4)  <dig> min over-exposure. for both latter exposures, the sample was flowing continuously back and forth through the beam. we have collected a total of  <dig> patterns for standard exposure and  <dig> patterns for  <dig> min and  <dig> min exposures. the comparison between saxs and afm data has been limited to standard,  <dig> min and  <dig> min exposures.

atomic force microscopy 
afm images were recorded in amplitude modulation  mode in liquid  <cit>  with photothermal excitation on cypher and piezo-dither excitation mode on a mfp3d . cantilevers used are the msnl  and olympus ac <dig> . scan sizes were  <dig> μm × <dig> μm,  <dig> μm ×  <dig> μm, or  <dig> μm ×  <dig> μm.

the scan rate was  <dig> lines per second, the image size was either  <dig> lines and  <dig> points per line or  <dig> lines and  <dig> points. the atomically flat surfaces were cleaved mica, cleaved mica ion-exchanged with nickel, and cleaved highly ordered pyrolytic graphite . pre-treated mica was prepared by placing  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm nicl  <dig> on a cleaved mica disk, incubating for  <dig> minutes, then rinsing with water and drying with nitrogen  <cit> .

to deposit β-amylase protein onto a surface,  <dig> μl of 1/ <dig> diluted solution  were placed on the surface and incubated for  <dig> min. the surface was then rinsed with  <dig> ml of buffer and covered with  <dig> μl of buffer for imaging in liquid.

to deposit tobacco mosaic virus ,  <dig> μl of 1/ <dig> diluted tmv solution  was placed on the surface and incubated for a full hour before rinsing. the surface was then rinsed with  <dig> ml of water and covered with  <dig> μl of water for imaging in liquid.

to obtain a representative collection of afm images, three different  <dig> μ
m
 <dig> areas were imaged randomly on a given sample. within each area, three  <dig> μ
m
 <dig> random areas were chosen from which to characterize proteins. if necessary,  <dig> μ
m
 <dig> scans were made for areas of particular interest to provide higher resolution images. image data treatment, such as flattening, was performed using gwyddion  <cit>  and/or destripe  <cit> .

statistical evaluation of isolated particles in afm images
previously flattened afm height images were used in gwyddion. when necessary additional flattening was performed to further reduce stripe noise. a grain particle analysis was performed with gwyddion using the automated thresholding method of otsu for all images except images of β-amylase when deposited on bare mica in which case a classical thresholding method of 11– <dig> % was used instead. grain size distribution was recorded using the major semiaxis of equivalent ellipse . ellipse was chosen instead of circle due to the elongated shape of tmv. consequently, the same numerical measure has been used for β-amylase and tmv. however, control data did not reach exactly a long-axis radius of  <dig> nm for tmv . this is likely due to the fact that the automated ellipsoid fit performed in gwyddion does not distinguish tmv particles that are touching with each other. average values were obtained from at least two afm images for control and over-exposed conditions using the top  <dig> peaks of the grain particle distribution. observations made with this criteria would also be valid if we took the top peak of the distribution. the reason to combine the top  <dig> peaks is that in several distributions, there is not a single major top peak and thus the “correct” value corresponding to such a distribution ought to be the average of nearby peaks. values reported on figures are average +/− standard deviations.

protocol for combining saxs with afm
when planning combined experiments, it is important to consider the effects of x-ray exposure, both short and long term, related to the biosaxs experiment  <cit> . biosaxs data is routinely checked for short term variations during exposure and shows there is no variation on the length scales  and time scales . remeasured samples  can show significant differences. it is for this reason and the favorable highly dilute state  required for afm that samples were measured by saxs and only the remaining sample volume  was used for afm. for studying the effect of radiation damage, samples exposed to the x-ray beam for measurements were recuperated and analyzed by afm alongside the non-exposed controls. due to the time needed to prepare the sample for afm, the time between the two experiments was  <dig> minutes for β-amylase and an hour for tmv.

RESULTS
β-amylase
the background corrected saxs curve of β-amylase is shown in fig. 1
a. the mean radius of gyration of the solution is  <dig>  nm. to verify that the β-amylase solution consisted primarily of tetrameric β-amylase complexes, the scattering of the β-amylase in solution was compared with the theoretical scattering of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric β-amylase proteins using the program oligomer  <cit> . using atomistic models of the protein monomer, dimer, and tetramer, the program fits the theoretical scattering of all three to the observed solution scattering and determines their ratio. β-amylase was determined to consist of about  <dig> % tetramers and  <dig> % monomers  without any contribution from dimeric forms .

afm images were obtained with β-amylase adsorbed on hydrophilic mica in liquid environment using the amplitude modulation  mode. no significant adsorption of β-amylase has been observed on hydrophobic graphite . when β-amylase was deposited onto mica, a uniform distribution of particles was observed, with an average height of  <dig> nm and an average long-axis radius of  <dig>  nm which is smaller than expected from the diameter of β-amylase crystal structure . according to molecular sizes observed with afm, it is likely that only monomers of β-amylase are imaged by afm.

because the surface of mica is negatively charged, two experimental conditions were used to image irradiated β-amylase : bare mica or mica pre-treated with nicl  <dig> solution. except for native β-amylase, samples were collected after saxs beamline exposure. figure 1

tmv
crystal structure of tmv, as well as electron micrographs, indicate that tmv is about  <dig> nm long with a diameter of about  <dig> nm  <cit> . the background corrected saxs cross sectional guinier plot of tmv is shown in the inset of fig. 5
a. the cross-sectional radius of gyration is found to be  <dig>  nm. the low q-region of the curve can be fitted with a three shell cylinder model, using parameters comparable to those reported in the literature   <cit> . the peaks in the region of  <dig> nm − <dig> can be attributed to fibre diffraction from the helical repeat of tmv   <cit> . the cross-sectional pair distance distribution function shown in fig. 5
b was calculated using d
max= <dig> nm based on the virus height determined by afm. it is rather symmetric, with its maximum at  <dig>  nm. it is noteworthy that the afm output has been used here as constraint for saxs data treatment as it is conventionally done using nmr or electron microscopy data. figure 5
e reports saxs data at different exposure times. tmv saxs patterns present very small variations in the q-range of  <dig>  to  <dig> nm − <dig>  however, the structural parameters reported in table  <dig> for tmv do not show any consistent variation with the exposure time.

tmv particles were imaged with afm after saxs measurements both on freshly cleaved hopg or pre-treated mica . on freshly cleaved mica no tmv could be detected  whereas on nickel-coated mica, tmv particles of about  <dig> nm height were detected . the coverage was estimated at  <dig>  % using a mask selecting all points higher than  <dig> nm. when deposited on hopg , tmv particles of similar height  were observed with a surface coverage of  <dig>  % . the observed heights of tmv are similar to values reported in the literature when imaging tmv on mica  <cit> .
fig.  <dig> afm imaging of tmv using tapping mode in liquid environment. top row  is tmv deposited on hopg whereas bottom row  corresponds to tmv deposited on nickel pre-treated mica. non-irradiated tmv is shown in . increasing exposure to x-ray beam is shown in  for  <dig> s exposure, and   <dig> min exposure. the scan size is  <dig> μm with each line made of  <dig> pixels. a clear fragmentation of the  <dig> nm-long tmv can be observed upon increase in exposure time . to the contrary of β-amylase , even at standard exposure time, a beginning of fragmentation is observed for tmv. a total of  <dig> afm images has been used for statistical analysis representing  <dig> particles on hopg at  <dig> μm scan size,  <dig> particles on hopg at  <dig> μm scan size, and  <dig> particles on nickel pre-treated mica




effect of radiation damage is clearly seen in afm images between control data  and over-exposed data  as well as standard exposure  when tmv was deposited on the hydrophobic hopg surface. quantification of such effect is obtained by estimating long-axis radius measurements of tmv particles upon different x-ray beam exposure times . by combining all afm data, long-axis radius of tmv in over-exposed data is about  <dig> nm whereas the value for control data is about  <dig> nm. it can be seen that, to the contrary of β-amylase, increasing exposure time on tmv lead to a reduction in its long-axis radius from  <dig> to  <dig> fold. a gradual and consistent decrease in tmv long-axis radius can be seen from control, to standard, and over-exposure. it can also be observed that the long-axis radius of control tmv is not  <dig> nm  but about 2/ <dig> of this value. it is likely that the 2d image fitting algorithm performs poorly when tmv particle appears in bunch rather than well isolated . the clear difference observed in afm images of tmv on mica and hopg suggests a clear physico-chemical change occurring for tmv upon radiation damage. whereas native tmv tends to aggregate on hopg, a more uniform adsorption on hopg is observed upon x-ray beam exposure concomitantly with a reduction in tmv particle average length.

at the esrf beamline, it is not possible to perform ultra-small angle x-ray scattering experiments. consequently, changes in length of tmv could not be obtained using regular saxs data due to large size of tmv .

discussion
saxs scattering provides reliable characterization of the average structural properties of biological macromolecules by measuring the scattering curve and interpreting it to determine model-independent structural parameters of molecules. although 3d reconstructions of shape of macromolecules from scattering curves are possible, they are often not unique. moreover, saxs as a technique is able to visualize a wide range of dimensions depending on the x-ray energy and the angular range observed, but the maximum size observable for any given experiment is limited. for the standard setup at bm <dig> a q-range of  <dig>  to  <dig> nm − <dig> can be observed which corresponds to a longest particle dimension of approximately  <dig> nm. as the long axis of tobacco mosaic virus  is in the order of  <dig> nm, this dimension could not be measured directly in the standard configuration of bm <dig>  fortunately, the observed scattering of the tmv is dominated by the circular cross-section of the cylinder, featuring the coat protein and rna strand allowing direct comparison between saxs and afm. the afm experiments confirmed the rod-like structure of the tmv sample with a cross-section of 17– <dig> nm. the cross-sectional radius of gyration was calculated as  <dig>  nm assuming a rod-like structure. for a homogeneous disc of radius r,r=2rg= <dig>  nm, which is in direct agreement with the diameter of  <dig> nm reported in literature  <cit> . it should be emphasized that the calculation of  pair distance distribution function requires to find the correct maximum distance d
max. in this work, this value was obtained from real space measurements with the afm allowing a direct access to this parameter, thereby greatly reducing the ambiguity of the analysis. in the case of tmv, using the  <dig> nm diameter determined by afm indeed allowed us to calculate the cross-sectional pair distance distribution function without bias.

radiation damage  <cit>  have been mostly investigated in x-ray crystallography where it was observed that radiation damage on proteins starts with the reduction of metal centers followed by elongation/scission of disulfide bonds and then decarboxylation of asp and glu side chains  <cit> . moreover, such decarboxylation of acidic amino acids is also observed due to radiation damage with electron microscopy  <cit> .

afm imaging of single molecules has already been used to observe protective effect of ascorbic acid against double-strand breaks in dna generated by reactive oxygen species  <cit> . in addition, afm has also been coupled with dynamic light scattering technique to help in understanding consequences of radiation-induced conformational change in chromatin structure. it was found that even at low dose  chromatin shows radiation damage as evidence by a change in hydrodynamic size that was likely due to single-strand breaks in dna  <cit> . in saxs, radiation damage most often present itself as aggregation  <cit> . even with sample flow enable, radiation damage in lysozyme, evidenced by an increase in radius of gyration , still occurs as early as  <dig> ms exposure time  <cit> . at increasing dose on lysozyme, an increase in r
g has been observed in relation to radiation damage  <cit> . combining saxs with uv/visible absorption spectra revealed change in protein solution due to x-ray radiation on bovine serum albumine  as shown by an increase of r
g from  <dig>  to  <dig> nm  <cit> . however, it was also found that early effect of radiation damage was an increase of molecular size without any significant unfolding suggesting that radiation damage observed on bsa was compatible with the presence of radical activities  <cit> . reduction in radiation damage has been obtained using cryo-saxs  <cit>  or using time-resolved saxs  <cit> . besides, fast detection readout allows collection of saxs before radiation damage occur  <cit> .

in our study, afm imaging of isolated molecules of β-amylase revealed a tripling in size upon over-exposure to x-ray beam. from this result, two hypotheses are possible: agglomeration of several β-amylase monomers or a tightening of β-amylase tetramer upon x-ray exposure so that when imaged on mica the tetrameric form of β-amylase is now stable and better preserved than β-amylase without x-ray exposure. the second hypothesis appears more likely due to saxs observation that no significant change in r
g was observed upon over x-ray exposition of β-amylase , and that β-amylase remains mostly tetrameric. besides, it has been shown that one consequence of irradiation damage in synchrotron saxs experiment was a change of the protein surface due to radical attacks leading to a greater attraction between lysozyme molecules and causing aggregation: a mechanism that could also be envisaged to multimeric proteins such as β-amylase  <cit> . the current resolution of afm does not allow imaging at the atomic scale on isolated proteins to identify more precisely what is the mechanism of such increase in size. in particular, knowing the convolution effect due to tip broadening in afm images, it is not possible to attribute β-amylase native tetramers on afm controlled images . the only possible explanation is that only smaller structures are observed, mostly monomers whose presence is also detected by saxs, for non irradiated β-amylase while, upon x-ray exposure, afm images show an expected size of tetrameric β-amylase. at the moment, it is not possible to speculate about the presence of crosslink in β-amylase upon x-ray exposure, as the resolution of afm imaging does not allow such level of details.

finally, it is striking that afm imaging can indirectly distinguish between two conformations of tetrameric β-amylase: native and x-ray over-exposed while saxs data does not make a significant distinction.

radiation damage in tmv particle is different from β-amylase essentially due to the high aspect/ratio of tmv which is a rod-like of  <dig> nm long. tmv, as most plant viruses, are very stable molecular constructs that can resist harsh storage condition  for several years. tmv is consequently a perfect sample for studying radiation damage as no degradation is expected to occur when deposited on mica  <cit> . upon increasing exposure time in x-ray beam, a breaking of tmv is consistently seen. in this case, radiation damage on tmv resemble closely that obtained on dna, i.e. breaking into smaller parts.

it is noteworthy that the imaging substrate surface has a significant importance in afm. this is for instance brought forward by the comparison between bare mica and nickel pre-treated mica in this study . indeed, tmv adsorption is more efficient on nickel pre-treated mica than on simple mica. however, no substrate is ideal due to the apparent contradictory requirement of strong fixation of biomolecules on a surface with low deformation of adsorbed molecules.

surface charges of mica may affect the shape of deposited single molecules. for instance, a height reduction of  <dig> nm is observed when tmv is deposited on mica and imaged in air, while the height difference of tmv when imaged in liquid is close to  <dig>  nm . however, such reduction in height has never been observed to be concomitant with a reduction of tmv length as observed in this study when tmv is exposed to x-ray beam.

another difference between tmv and β-amylase, is that with tmv radiation damage are detected with short exposure time whereas in β-amylase radiation damage are mostly visible upon over-exposure time. however, a common behavior between β-amylase and tmv upon x-ray beam exposure is their apparent change in molecular surface properties. although it is only suggested for β-amylase, it is clearly observed for tmv. indeed, when native tmv is deposited on hydrophobic surface  there is non uniform binding of tmv on hopg whereas, upon x-ray beam exposure, tmv displays an increased uniformity in adsorption with hopg. because breakage of long tmv particles into smaller pieces, damaged tmv now exposes hidden buried surfaces. from the tmv x-ray structure, such hidden surfaces are known to be rather hydrohobic explaining the sudden increased affinity of irradiated tmv on hopg. a clear benefit of afm imaging is observed, first by looking at individual molecules, and second at global properties when changing imaging substrates. consequently, if reasonable protein binding is observed on hopg, it could be recommended to use hydrophobic surfaces for imaging x-ray exposed molecules, and thus detect easily the presence of radiation damage by looking at variation of protein binding on hopg. such apparent change in molecular surface properties has been already observed in case of lipid model membranes deposited onto silicon substrates in an in-situ x-ray - afm combined experiment  <cit> . both x-ray reflectometry and afm showed a deacrease of the membranes surface coverage after exposure to x-ray.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of saxs and afm can be applied to a variety of different macromolecules and sample surfaces depending on characterization needs and sample properties. taking advantage of the flexible user access to both the dedicated biosaxs beamline  and esrf surface science laboratory, these experiments can be undertaken on the same visit to the esrf. afm imaging requires around two hours and owing to the high dilution factor from saxs to afm no additional sample is needed for afm in addition to saxs. while saxs provides rapid characterization of the average properties of a sample, afm can be used to verify the homogeneity of the sample and provide measurements at the single particle level. as afm gives direct measurement of single particles it is possible to use the afm results as additional constraints for modeling purpose thereby extending the possibilities to interpret the saxs data and reduce ambiguity in the results. the use of combined saxs-afm in one experimental visit is facilitated by the presented protocol which enables cross validation, and increased confidence in the conclusions which can be drawn from the experiments. furthermore, combination of saxs-afm is well adapted to study effect of radiation damage on various type of biological samples. radiation damage is a very complex process and can produce either a change of the protein surface or a breakage of long biological particles, as it has been shown in this work for β-amylase and tmv, respectively.
