BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of short , endogenous non-coding small rnas that have base pair sequences complementary with specific target genes to repress their translation or induce their degradation. while in animals regulation of gene expression by mirnas is achieved by sequence-specific targeting of the 3' untranslated region of mrnas, the plant mirnas generally interact with their targets through perfect or near-perfect complementarity to direct mrna degradation  <cit> . a growing number of new mirnas in plants have been identified in recent years. to date, more than  <dig> genes encoding mirnas have been annotated in arabidopsis, rice and other plant species  <cit> . moreover, several other classes of small rnas , distinguished by their origin and biological function, have been identified. these include heterochromatic sirnas, trans-acting sirnas , natural antisense sirnas , piwi-interacting rnas  <cit> , and a recently identified class of small rnas associated with gene promoters  and 3' termini   <cit> .

identification of comprehensive sets of mirnas and other small rnas in different plant species is a critical step to facilitate our understanding of regulatory mechanisms or networks for target genes and cell development. the higher plants contain diverse cell types. each of them has its own initiating program, structure and biological function. cellular differentiation is accompanied by changes in transcription, translation and many other physiological processes  <cit> . cotton fibers are single-celled epidermal trichomes and provide an outstanding model for investigation of cellular and developmental events which also occur in arabidopsis leaf trichomes  <cit> . the development of a fiber cell is a complex morphological and molecular process, which is characterized by cell cycle status, transcriptional control and multiple cytoskeletal functions comprising an integrated hierarchy of regulation. recently, a number of genes controlling early fiber initiation and late development have been identified, and some of them have been functionally characterized. ghmyb <dig>  a putative ortholog of atmybgl <dig>  is specifically expressed in fiber cell initials and elongating cells  <cit> . moreover, ectopic expression of gamyb <dig> induces a single trichome in epidermis of arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . two cotton genes containing wd <dig> domains complement the arabidopsis ttg <dig> mutant  <cit> . comparative studies on arabidopsis leaf trichomes and multiple gene expression have provided great insights into the cotton ovular fiber development  <cit> . using microarray technology, hundreds of transcripts were analyzed and exhibited distinct expression patterns during the early stage of fiber cell development  <cit> . using a computational approach, we initially identified  <dig> potential mirnas from cotton ; further,  <dig> potential targets were detected for these potential mirnas  <cit> . more recently, several other labs also performed in silico identification of dozens of conserved mirnas from the same species  <cit> . amongst the putative targets these studies reported were transcription factors , auxin responsive proteins and other genes related to fiber development  <cit> . to explore the role of small rnas in cotton fibers, abdurakhmonov and co-workers recently analyzed small rna sequences from 0- <dig> days post anthesis  developing cotton ovules and obtained hundreds of small rnas  <cit> . although  <dig> unique sequence signatures of small rnas were achieved, only two conserved mirnas were detected. it is most likely that the traditional method does not sequence deeply enough to sample the full complexity of small rnas in ovules. recently developed high-throughput sequencing technologies provide a powerful approach to identify and quantify srnas/mirnas  <cit> . small rnas are best discovered and measured by deep sequencing methods that have high sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . additionally, it is feasible to explore or annotate mirnas in organisms whose genome sequences have not been completed. here, we adopted a deep sequencing method developed by solexa  to identify small rnas from cotton ovules and analyze abundance and complexity of small rnas. we constructed two small rna libraries prepared from wild type  and fuzz/lintless  cotton ovules, respectively. samples were collected from 0- <dig> dpa developing cotton ovules, which cover major morphological changes as well as several underlying developmental processes including fiber initiation and elongation  <cit> . each library was sequenced individually and generated more than 6- <dig> million short sequences, with a total of over  <dig> million sequence reads. we obtained more than  <dig> conserved mirnas representing  <dig> families from the cotton ovules. many of them were originally identified in this study. in addition, two non-conserved novel mirna candidates were identified.

RESULTS
analysis of sequences
previous studies have demonstrated that cotton fiber development is a complex process that involves a large number of gene expression and regulation  <cit> . to understand whether small rna is involved in the process, we employed a upland cotton cultivar xuzhou  <dig>  and a fuzzless-lintless mutant in xuzhou  <dig> background, both of which were genetically identified  <cit>  and are phenotypically similar except for the feature of the mutant seeds bearing few or no fibers . microarray analyses of transcripts demonstrated that a number of genes in the wild-type and fl mutant ovules were differentially expressed between 0- <dig> dpa  <cit> . based on the fact, we reasoned that deep sequencing ovular small rna would provide a full view of small rna components and differential expression profiles of small rnas between the wild-type and mutant. thus, two small rna libraries were constructed from the wild-type and mutant ovules. deep sequencing the libraries generated  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads from the wild-type and mutant ovules, respectively. after the removal of low quality reads and corrupted adapter sequences ,  <dig> , <dig> reads  remained for the wild-type and  <dig> , <dig> reads  for the mutant. the majority of small rnas was 21- <dig> nt for both libraries , with  <dig> nt small rna being the most abundant , which is within the typical size range for dicer-derived products and in agreement with most of the previous results  <cit> .

the dataset was used to query the non-coding rnas sequences deposited at ncbi genbank  and the rfam database  <cit>  in order to separate the small rnas that match to non-coding sequences such as rrna, trna, snrna and snorna. these accounted for  <dig>  reads  in wild-type and  <dig>  reads  in mutant. since the cotton genome has not been completely sequenced, we used short oligonucleotide analysis package  <cit>  to annotate small rna sequences that map to tigr cotton transcript assemblies  . with only  <dig>  tas available, less than 10% of the small rnas from each library were mapped.

identification of conserved candidate mirnas
aligning small rna sequences to known mirnas resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  matches for wild-type and mutant, respectively. at least  <dig> conserved potential mirna families including  <dig> individual candidate mirnas were identified, with mirna families  <dig>   <dig> and 156/ <dig> being the most abundant . mir <dig> dominated in both libraries and accounted for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of all conserved mirna reads. several mirna families such as mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> had moderate abundance of expression. in contrast, some mirna families showed very low abundance of expression in ovules, with several read counts only. the varied abundance of the mirna families suggests that mirna genes would be differentially transcribed during the early fiber cell development. diversity of cotton fiber mirnas also can be found in the aspect of the amount of members they contain. the largest mirna family size identified was mir <dig> that consisted of  <dig> members and mir165/ <dig>  mir156/ <dig> and mir <dig> possessed  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively, whereas  <dig> mirna families such as mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> had only one member detected in the cotton ovules .

amongst the conserved mirnas families, ten  have not been identified before in cotton by any of the earlier, mostly in silico, studies  <cit> . these mirnas can be considered as new but species-conserved mirnas in g. hirsutum. these included mir159a/b/c/f, mir <dig>  mir319a/c/e, mir473a, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir535a, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  . we also compared mirnas from this study to those computationally predicted and found there were  <dig> overlaps of mirna families , indicating that most of the previously predicted mirnas could be recovered by the deep-sequencing method.

the number of reads reflects enrichment of mirnas. most of the mirna read frequencies exhibit significant differences between the two libraries. expression of mir165/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were significantly up-regulated in mutant compared to the wild-type, whereas mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed down-regulation in mutant relative to the wild-type. the abundantly presented families like mir165/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were expressed very highly in the mutant. mir <dig> was detected 6-fold higher in wild-type than in mutant. several other mirna families such as mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> also showed higher levels of expression in mutant than in wild-type. to a lesser degree, mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed comparatively low expression levels in mutant. interestingly, the highly enriched mir156/ <dig> family was found at similar levels in both libraries.

analysis of novel mirna candidates
since the completely sequenced genome of cotton is unavailable, unique small rna sequences were mapped to cotton tigr plant transcript assemblies sequences to identify potentially novel mirnas. also, because of the unknown background of cotton small rna population, it is rather challenging to confidentially identify non-conserved mirnas. secondary structures were predicted and analyzed for stable stem-loop hairpins. following blastn search and hairpins structure prediction, two putative g. hirsutum unique mirnas were detected , both of which meet the new criteria of mirna annotation  <cit> . we found that the two mirnas  have structures that feature both mirna and mirna* . for ghr-mirnvl <dig>   <dig> reads were detected at the 5' and  <dig> reads at the 3'. ghr-mirnvl <dig> had  <dig> 5' reads and  <dig> 3' reads. ghr-mirnvl <dig> and ghr-mirnvl <dig> were found in both wild-type and mutant libraries, suggesting that the  <dig> mirna candidates are g. hirsutum-specific.

the 5p and 3p sequences originate from the 5' and 3' arm of the folded precursors, respectively. wt: xuzhou  <dig> ; m: fuzzless-lintless mutant in xuzhou  <dig> background.

prediction of mirna targets
targets were predicted for all identified mirna families. in total  <dig> unique target genes were predicted for  <dig> of the conserved mirna families . only genes with known or putative functions were presented. some mirna families have multiple target sites , suggesting that these mirnas are functionally divergent. additionally, a single gene may potentially be targeted by several mirnas . on the basis of the biological functions described by uniprot , these target genes can be grouped into  <dig> categories. the majority of targets fall into the category of transcription regulation, indicating these genes encode transcript factors . several other groups contain genes regulating transport, oxidative reduction, signal transduction pathway, and enzymes involved in metabolisms, respectively. unfortunately, none of the target genes have been predicted for the two novel candidate mirnas. this is most possibly attributed to the incomplete cotton genome.

targets were predicted for the identified conserved mirna  and grouped by the biological function of the proteins they encode for, as described by uniprot . transcripts coding for proteins involved in the regulation of transcription were prevalent.

discussion
to date, more than one thousand plant mirna genes have been annotated and some of them have been well characterized  <cit> . however, the number of plant mirnas appears not to be saturated and many other functional mirnas in plant species remain to be investigated. compared to annotated mirnas from arabidopsis and rice, very few mirnas from cotton plants have been identified. recently, several studies performed in silico identification of mirnas from g. hirsutum  <cit> . approximate  <dig> highly conserved mirna families were detected and several less conserved mirnas  were found. when compared to the mirnas predicted previously, most of them could be recovered by deep sequencing, and only a small portion of them  were not  <cit> . these missing mirnas might be attributed to the fact that the sequences  used for prediction were derived from tissues such as leaves or roots rather than ovules. also, it was likely that false positive predictions were included. on the other hand, several mirnas  such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were not successfully predicted, suggesting that these mirnas may be tissue-specific in cotton ovules. mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been recently cloned from cotton  ovule using a traditional cloning approach  <cit> , both of which were also detected in this study.

the present study is the first to deep sequence the small rna population of g. hirsutum ovules where cotton fiber cells initiate and develop. millions of unique sirna sequences ranging from 18~ <dig> nt in length were detected. analysis of the evolutionary conservation of these mirnas revealed  <dig> individual conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> families. together with the several g. hirsutum mirnas existing in mirbase , this study will bring the number of mirnas in g. hirsutum up to  <dig> 

the vast majority of conserved mirnas from cotton ovules is not surprising. most of the mirnas identified in this study are conserved in arabidopsis and only a few are conserved in other plant species. the phenomenon can be explained by the fact that cotton fibers  and epidermal hairs  are phenotypically similar; both types of trichomes use a common mechanism, e.g. that closely associated with the transcription factors for regulating trichome initiation and development  <cit> . notably, some highly conserved mirna families such as mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were sequenced more than ten thousands or even one hundred thousands times in a single library. these highly conserved mirnas may represent a relationship between evolutionary conservation and expression abundance  <cit> . on the opposite, some mirna families that are less conserved or even species-specific have very low abundance. from an evolutionary view, these mirnas play a role in establishing and maintaining phenotypic diversity between different groups of organisms and are involved in regulation of the lineage-specific pathways and functions  <cit> . in addition to the conserved mirnas, two putative mirnas identified in this study do not have orthologs in arabidopsis and other species . since the non-conserved mirnas usually express at a low level and in specific cell types , it is suggested that these cotton-specific mirnas may have expanded after the divergence of the monocot and dicot plant lineages, supporting the presumption that a diverse set of mirnas are evolving rapidly and independently with each species  <cit> .

our comparative analysis of small rna abundance between the wild-type and fl mutant indicated that the mutant contains an altered small rna population, with a smaller proportion of total rna reads. however, in fl mutants many small rna families with 21- <dig> nt were enriched . differential mirna abundance was also found between the wild-type and mutant. a surprising observation was that the majority of mirna families in fl mutant had significantly higher abundance than in wild-type . this result suggests that the mutant has a changed regulation of mirna expression during the fiber development. further identification of the regulatory process and metabolic pathway in mutants will provide insights into the impaired mirna biogenesis and abnormal trichome cell differentiation.

it is of interest that a large number of mirnas from ovules potentially target transcription factors, which was consistent with our previous predictions  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> mediates cleavage of myb <dig> and myb <dig> transcripts, the two transcription factors that function as positive regulators of abscisic acid  response  <cit> . similarly, mir <dig> is complementary to a highly conserved motif in the coding region of the gamyb-related clade of myb  <cit> . in this study, several members of putative myb families were predicted to have binding sites for mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  suggesting the potential regulation of fiber development. mir <dig> is of particular interest because it targets the ghmyb <dig> mrna. ectopic expression of ghmyb <dig> in transgenic tobacco plants causes abnormal cell shapes of leaf trichomes  <cit> .

amongst the predicted targets of mir <dig> was auxin response factors . these proteins are bound to the auxin response elements and regulate auxin-mediated transcriptional activation/repression. in vitro-cultured cotton ovules, exogenous auxin is required to promote fiber cell development  <cit> . our data have demonstrated that in the mutant, mir <dig> was expressed more highly. in rice culture cells, mir <dig> was shown to cleave arf <dig> mrna. the abundance of mir <dig> was controlled by the level of auxin in growth medium. when cells were grown in auxin-free medium, mir <dig> level decreased  <cit> . similarly, a putative arf <dig> transcript was predicted to be targeted by mir <dig> in cotton ovules. this suggests that auxin levels are possibly higher in the mutant ovules. we predicted mir <dig> to target an arf10-like mrna transcript, which expressed at higher levels in the mutant library, just like mir <dig>  mir <dig> targets putative transport inhibitor response  <dig>  transcripts in cotton. tir <dig> is an auxin receptor involved in a mechanism leading to the aux/iaa degradation  <cit> . inhibition of tir <dig> by mir <dig> would down-regulate auxin signaling. mir <dig> showed an expression level nearly  <dig> fold higher in mutants than in wild-type. interestingly, most of the mirnas involved in the auxin pathway were found to be up-regulated in the mutant.

in arabidopsis, several mirnas like mir <dig> and mir <dig> are induced by the nutrient deficiency  <cit> . under normal growth conditions, these mirnas do not express. however, both mir <dig> and mir <dig> were moderately sequenced in this study, particularly in the wild-type ovules . this can be attributed to the advantage that deep sequencing can detect mirnas at a very low level. under phosphorus starvation, mir <dig> targets a ubiquitin-conjugating e <dig> enzyme, which in turn regulates pi acquisition  <cit> . in this study, deep sequencing identified  <dig> mir <dig> members and  <dig> unique genes were predicted as potential targets of mir <dig>  more interestingly, all of these predicted targets appear not to be correlated with phosphate metabolism. this result provides a new clue to the multiple roles of mir <dig> that may play in diverse cell types or species. mir399f/g were predicted to have complementarity to a putative myb family transcription factor. besides, mir399g targets four cotton vacuolar atp synthase subunit b transcripts. in cotton fiber, elongation is driven by turgor pressure generated by vacuolar h+-atpase activity on tonoplasts  <cit> . the process occurs synchronously with the increase in the rate of cell elongation, indicating that vacuolar h+-atpase may play a crucial role in cotton fiber development  <cit> .

expression of mir <dig> was much lower in mutant than in wild-type. previously, mir <dig> in arabidopsis was identified to target gene coding cu/zn superoxide dismutase  <cit> . similar target was predicted for the mir <dig> from cotton ovules. interestingly, specific cotton cu/zn superoxide dismutase have been recently detected in the secondary cell walls of developing cotton fibers and are suggested to be involved in cell wall growth  <cit> . whether mir <dig> regulates superoxide dismutase and cell wall growth would be an interesting topic to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
using deep sequencing method many of conserved mirnas from cotton ovules were identified. our results indicated that there are differential expression profiles of mirnas from the wild-type and mutant ovules, which can be expected to regulate transcripts distinctly involved in cotton fiber development. further identification of these differentially expressed mirnas from ovules would allow better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for fiber cell development.
