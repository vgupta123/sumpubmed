BACKGROUND
in their fluctuating environment, plants are constantly exposed to abiotic stimuli to which they are sensitive and responsive. some of these stimuli, such as wind exposure, count a strong mechanical component that has a major influence on plant growth and development. exposure to such mechanical stimulations results in the so-called thigmomorphogenetic syndrome characterized by a reduction in stem elongation  <cit> , local stimulation of radial growth  <cit> , and modification of the stem’s mechanical properties  <cit> . these alterations of plant architecture are thought to improve plant acclimation to chronic wind regimes  <cit> . using continuous monitoring techniques  <cit> , the early kinetics of these plant growth responses were studied in tomato and poplar by applying quantified stem bending. in poplar, a single transitory stem bending led first to a short period of secondary growth inhibition  followed by a massive stimulation of the growth rate over 3 days, and finally a relaxation to normal values  <cit> .

to better understand tree acclimation to wind, it is important to first unravel the processes that regulate thigmomorphogenetic syndrome. however, the way plant cells perceive and transduce mechanical signals is still poorly understood. two major classes of potential mechanosensors are thought to be involved: plant mechanosensitive  ion channels and receptor-like kinases  inserted into the cell wall–plasma membrane–cytoskeleton continuum . prior to the advent of transcriptomics, studies had identified a handful of mechanoresponsive genes, including touch genes  that mainly encode calmodulins or calmodulin-like proteins and xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase   <cit> , genes encoding protein kinases  <cit> , transcription factors   <cit> , genes involved in jasmonic acid  and ethylene synthesis  <cit> , and genes involved in antioxidative responses  <cit> . in  <dig>  a transcriptome analysis of touch-stimulated arabidopsis rosette leaves allowed a more global insight into the molecular functions altered after a touch-stimulus. over  <dig> genes presented regulated expression 30 min after the stimulus  <cit> , representing over  <dig> % of the genome. among these genes, the vast majority  were up-regulated. analysis of the functional categorization of these up-regulated genes revealed enrichment in genes encoding calcium-binding proteins, cell-wall proteins, disease resistance proteins, kinases and tf, and a decline in genes involved in general metabolism and the ubiquitin/protein degradation pathway. for the down-regulated genes, the “transcription factor” and “cell-wall-associated protein” categories were over-represented. in a subsequent transcriptomic study of the effect of a long-term exposure  to low-speed wind in populus nigra leaves, fluch et al. found at least  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes  <cit> , including genes encoding cell-wall modification proteins, proteins with regulatory roles , reactive oxygen species  producing or scavenging proteins, or constituents of microtubules. unfortunately, these two transcriptomic studies concern a unique time-point after stimulation, giving a very static view of the molecular response to mechanical stimulus. in  <dig>  kimbrough et al. found  <dig>  mechanoresponsive genes on root apices that were transiently  stimulated by moving them back and forth and harvested at different times   <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the only in-depth kinetic  study ever made in plants on responses to mechanical stimuli. however, these data cannot be viably extrapolated to the responses of aboveground organs, as the soil and aerial mechanical environments, and the selective pressures they apply to the corresponding organs, are highly distinct.

despite the tentative general flowchart of physiological and molecular responses to mechanoperception established by telewski  <cit> , we still have no general understanding of molecular mechanoresponse. the fact is that most molecular thigmomorphogenesis studies were realized on different plant species, submitted to different types of mechanical stimulations, with a huge majority of them using uncontrolled mechanical loadings, all of which makes cross-comparison difficult.

there is an even more striking lack of molecular information for recurring mechanical loads such as wind episodes  <cit> . in  <dig>  martin et al. assessed poplar responses to multiple successive stem bendings mimicking wind, and provided the first evidence of a process of desensitization to mechanical loads at the growth and molecular levels  <cit> . they found that four early mechanoresponsive genes —encoding two calmodulins, a c2h <dig> tf, i.e. ptazfp <dig>  and a xth, respectively— responded with lower intensity to a second stem bending, applied 24 h after a first one. this phenomenon is now referred to as ‘accommodation’ and is thought to be crucial to avoid over-response to wind  <cit> . in trees, transcriptomic analysis of transgenic poplars overexpressing ptazfp <dig> constituted a first step toward the characterization of this phenomenon at molecular level. this study suggested that part of the accommodation process could be explained by a regulation at transcriptional level  <cit> , thus requiring a more global analysis.

deciphering the molecular mechanisms driving poplar accommodation to bending stimulation could be crucial to help better understand how trees acclimate to wind. in this study, our aim was to identify new molecular actors involved in mechanoresponse and the accommodation process, and unravel their kinetics of contribution. we thus conducted a time-series search of the transcriptome changes in poplar stem tissue subjected to one or two successive bendings.

RESULTS
kinetic analysis of the transcriptomic responses to a single bending in poplar stem
to unravel the complexity and dynamics of the transcriptomic response of poplar stem to a bending stimulus, we performed microarray gene expression profiling at  <dig>  h, 2 h, 24 h or 72 h after a tightly controlled bending.

statistical analysis revealed  <dig>  genes differentially expressed along the time-course . these differentially expressed genes  represented 6% of the whole poplar genome, and  <dig> % of them were regulated at just  <dig>  h or 2 h post-bending . a third of the deg observed at  <dig>  h pb keep being differentially expressed at 2 h pb. at these earlier time-points, a higher number of deg was up-regulated. at 24 h pb, the transcriptomic response concerned a smaller set of genes , most of which were down-regulated. at 72 h pb, the number of deg was equally distributed between up- and down-regulated categories.fig.  <dig> global analysis of deg after bending in poplar stem. venn diagram shows the distribution and the overlaps of deg at  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h pb.  <dig>  different deg were identified. numbers in the central part indicate the number of repressed and induced genes at each time-point. proportion of deg corresponding to tf oscillates between  <dig> and 6%




as a first examination of the mechanical regulatory network, we considered for each time-point the transcripts presenting the higher amplitude of regulation . at  <dig>  h pb, the  <dig> most highly up-regulated genes encompassed genes already known to present a short-term response to mechanical stimuli, such as an ortholog of a xth   <cit> , or ptazfp <dig>  <cit> , a poplar c2h <dig> tf . strongly affected expression was also found for two other tf: one that was related to ethylene signalling  and the other that was an ortholog of rrtf , a redox-responsive member of the ethylene response factor  tf subfamily  <cit> . interestingly, highly up-regulated genes also included homologs of the late embryogenesis abundant  hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family , including nhl10/ndr <dig>  a plasma membrane-embedded protein involved in mechanisms maintaining plasma membrane-cell-wall adhesions in arabidopsis  <cit> .

at 2 h and 72 h pb, the most highly up-regulated genes include many genes related to cell-wall modifications or wood formation. for example, three of the  <dig> most highly up-regulated genes at 2 h pb  encoded homologs of arabidopsis fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins  putatively involved in stem biomechanics in plants  <cit> . at 72 h pb, potri.009g <dig> and potri.011g <dig>  encode, respectively; a fla protein and a berberine bridge enzyme shown to play a role in lignin monolignol metabolism in arabidopsis  <cit> .

at 24 h pb, the set of genes most strongly up- or down-regulated are predicted to encode proteins involved in cellular metabolism, such as a homocysteine s-methyltransferase , antioxidant components  or elements of ribosome biogenesis .

a gene highly down-regulated  at  <dig>  h, 2 h, 72 h pb  matched to a homolog of arabidopsis phosphate <dig>  encoding a pi exporter  <cit> , pointing, for the first time, to a role of pi homeostasis in mechanoresponse.

transcriptional regulation of mechanoresponsive tf-encoding genes
among the  <dig>  mechanoresponsive genes,  <dig> corresponded to known or putative tf. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the proportion of tf varied over the time-course, representing  <dig> % of the deg at  <dig>  h pb but only  <dig> % at 24 h pb. these mechanoregulated tf were classified into  <dig> of the  <dig> tf families described in the planttf database  <cit> . the tf families were differentially represented depending on time post-bending . at  <dig>  h pb, nac-type tf represented a significant fraction of the regulated tf , whereas only  <dig> nac-type tf were differentially regulated at 72 h pb. other tf families involved in stress responses were highly represented at early time-points, as illustrated by the  <dig> wrky-type tf and the  <dig> members of the erf family. conversely, tf members of the tale family were involved at later time-points . members of the myb family were also highly represented among the mechanoresponsive tf, being present both at early and late time-points, and either up- or down-regulated. three members of this myb family show an interesting pattern of expression along the time-course by being down-regulated at  <dig>  h and up-regulated at 72 h. these poplar genes  respectively encode orthologs of myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> arabidopsis tf, known to be involved in the regulation of secondary cell wall biogenesis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> list of transcription factor families whose members are differentially expressed in response to bending. the planttfdb database  <cit>  was used to identify the tf-encoding genes and their family among deg. the family assignment rules based on the detection of pre-set domains in gene sequences identified  <dig> tf families . when a tf family appeared less than  <dig> times in deg, it was classified into the “other” category. the sig family, not present in planttfdb, was revealed by phytozome data




expression clustering and gene ontology analysis of mechanoresponsive genes in poplar
to gain insight into the biological processes underlying poplar response to bending, two approaches were combined: gene expression clustering and gene ontology  enrichment. using the k-means partitioning method, the expression profiles of the  <dig>  deg were distributed into  <dig> clusters, each represented in fig.  <dig> by their average gene expression. this clustering approach revealed a high diversity of expression profiles, many of them supported by a high number of genes . the most striking expression pattern, shown by  <dig> of the clusters, was an early and transitory induction at  <dig>  h pb. the most highly up-regulated genes are included in these same clusters . a smaller number of genes showed an initial down-regulation of expression followed by reversion to basal levels . clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> regrouped genes that were differentially expressed at more than two time-points across the time-series. some interesting expression patterns are also shown by cluster  <dig> regrouping genes that were down-regulated at  <dig>  h pb then up-regulated at 72 h pb, and clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> regrouping genes showing a regulation throughout the time-course. to find out whether these co-expressed genes could be indicative of putative biological function, each cluster was analysed for enrichment of go terms in the biological process , molecular function  and cellular component  categories . a clear picture delivered by this go analysis is the early activation of responses linked to “defence” or “abiotic stress” shown by different go enriched-terms found for clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  three of the four clusters regrouping the earlier, transitory and most up-regulated genes showed an over-representation of terms related to transcription regulation or tf in both the bp and mf categories . in contrast, cluster  <dig> is annotated with go terms related to “negative regulation of transcription”. this go analysis also argues in favour of an early triggering of a “signal transduction”  involving protein phosphorylation  and positive regulation of the mapk cascade . the early-up-regulated genes counted a high prevalence of go terms related to plant hormones, especially ethylene  and ja . interestingly, clusters composed of genes down-regulated 2 h pb  were enriched with genes related to photosynthesis or plastid function. for clusters of late-up-regulated genes , the go bp analysis suggests the involvement of genes contributing to remodelling of the cell wall. for example, clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are annotated with the “plant-type cell-wall organization or biogenesis”  or “regulation of secondary cell-wall biogenesis”  terms. given its enrichment with terms related to “microtubule-binding”  and the importance of microtubules in the build-up of the cell wall  <cit> , cluster  <dig> could also contain genes that are central to this cell-wall remodelling process.fig.  <dig> k-means clustering of gene expression data. a k-means clustering was performed on deg from the time-course and two-bendings experiments. for each cluster, at each time -point, a boxplot represent the dispersion of the log2-converted mean fold-change  for all the genes of the cluster. for graphical clarity, the different clusters were manually re-grouped according to their mean expression profile




time-course expression analysis of candidate genes by qrt-pcr
a rt-qpcrs experiment was performed with the dual aim of validating the reliability of our microarray experiment and refining the dynamics of the biological processes triggered in poplar after stem bending. expression of  <dig> selected genes was analysed along a new time-series made with samples collected at regular intervals between  <dig>  and 24 h pb . each gene was selected to be representative of a cluster on the basis of its expression profile and its putative biological function as determined by go categorization .fig.  <dig> expression profiles of selected genes along a refined time-course. total rnas were extracted from the stems of control plants and from bent stems at different times  after bending. changes in the abundance of the transcripts were analysed by qrt-pcr using specific primers . fold-changes are quantified in comparison to control plants collected at identical time-points. plain symbols correspond to a significantly different transcript accumulation in bent plants according to a mann–whitney-wilcoxon test




globally, except for one gene , the pcr data backs up the microarray analysis. moreover, the refined time-series revealed an even greater complexity of the responses. given the predominance of go terms related to “defence response” in our data, we studied a variety of genes involved in this biological process, typically members of the wrky, nac, gras, c2h <dig> and erf tf families. for some of these, the up-regulation observed at early time-points  is maintained until 9 h pb  whereas others show a more transient induction confined to the very first hours after bending . results considering several molecular components of calcium/ros/phosphorylation also showed contrasted patterns. whereas the tested genes involved in phosphorylation cascade signalling  or calcium signalling  were transiently induced at early stages , the up-regulation of ptaaca <dig>  encoding a putative calcium-transporting atpase enzyme involved in the export of ca2+, was maintained until 9 h pb. an unexpected result obtained with this pcr analysis was the down-regulation of a high number of early-induced genes at late stages  . considering hormonal signalling, our results suggested that ptaiaa <dig>  homologous to an auxin-regulated tf, and ptacesta, homologous to bhlh tf involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis, were down-regulated in a biphasic manner. for ja signalling, ptajam2- and ptajaz2-like, two predicted ja-induced tf, showed a high but very transient induction within the first 2 h pb. in contrast, the peak accumulation of transcripts of ptaaos <dig>  a gene encoding an allene oxide synthase probably involved in the ja biosynthetic pathway, was shifted to later stages . another set of genes  was rapidly down-regulated  and still repressed until 17 h pb. these genes encompassed functions related to cellular and metabolic processes, such as regulation of photosynthetic processes  or cellular homeostasis, as illustrated by ptaskor, an ortholog of an arabidopsis gene encoding a shaker family k+ channel. finally, the genes related to secondary cell-wall biogenesis , lignin synthesis  or microtubule dynamics  were repressed until around the 17th hour before recovering to basal levels.

combined with go analysis of the clusters, this time-course analysis provides a new picture of the molecular responses occurring in poplar stems in response to mechanical stimulation that was drawn in a simplified model of over-represented go terms  in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> time-course of the biological processes involved in response to bending. these annotations correspond to the go terms that are enriched in clusters of gene expression. biological processes are time-placed to match the expression of representative genes




genome-wide evaluation of the effect of successive mechanical stimulations
to unravel the genome-wide impact of successive mechanical stimuli, we analysed the effect of a second bending performed 24 h after a first one. as shown in fig. 6a, the genes presenting a modified expression due to the second bending were revealed through a statistical test by comparing their expression levels  <dig>  h after the second bending with their expression at 24 h after the first bending. we then compared the level of regulation of these deg against to their regulation observed at  <dig>  h after a single bending. the different gene profiles were then classified through a decision-tree approach .fig.  <dig> decision tree used to classify the genes into the “accommodated” or “non-accommodated” gene categories. a for each gene differentially regulated at  <dig>  h pb, “yes” or “no” status was determined by the statistical test resulting from the microarray analysis described above. b gene examples for the “accommodated” or “non-accommodated” gene categories. the ptawrky <dig> and ptahrd genes are differentially expressed at  <dig>  h pb but not at 24 h pb, whereas the expression of ptahrd is similarly regulated by the two successive bending while, ptawrky <dig> expression is less affected by the second bending than the first one. according to the decision tree, ptawrky <dig> is classified into the “accommodated gene” category, and ptahrd into the “non-accommodated gene” category




several regulation patterns were observed. the results showed that among the  <dig>  genes transiently regulated at  <dig>  h after a single mechanical stimulation,  <dig> were unaffected by the second bending and  <dig> were less regulated  fig. 6b, “accommodated gene”). among the  <dig> early-regulated genes that were still differentially expressed at 24 h after the first bending,  <dig> were not regulated by the second treatment and, for  <dig> genes, the analysis was unable to classify them. overall, this means that 96% of the deg regulated after the first mechanical stimulation are not any more or less affected by the second one.

this analysis also revealed  <dig> newly-regulated genes – i.e. genes that had shown no impact after a single mechanical treatment but were differentially regulated  <dig>  h after the second bending . finally, among the  <dig>  genes regulated by a single treatment, only  <dig> genes were similarly regulated after the second bending  in fig. 6b). as shown in table  <dig>  these “non-accommodated genes” were mainly distributed into three of the expression clusters previously defined in the time-series analysis: i.e. clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  grouping  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of these genes respectively. these co-expression profiles could suggest a common regulation.table  <dig> list of the “non-accommodated” genes after two successive bendings of young poplar stem

these genes are differentially expressed  <dig>  h after a single bending and their regulation is not different whether one or two successive bendings are applied. id_gene corresponds to the gene model found in the phytozome database  <cit>  for poplar or arabidopsis . log <dig> expression fold-change is shown for the different analyses: expression fold-change  <dig>  h after a single bending compared to a control plant  and expression fold-change after a second bending compared to the 24 h post-bending time-point 




interestingly, among the  <dig> “non-accommodated” genes, several are involved in maintaining the functional integrity of the plant cell wall after biotic/abiotic stresses in other species. indeed, several genes are predicted to encode members of the crrlk <dig> family of rlk in arabidopsis, such as potri.006g <dig>  an ortholog of feronia recently described as a putative mechanosensor in arabidopsis  <cit> , but also anx <dig>  and rlk <dig> . furthermore, among the other “non-accommodated” genes, some were described as components of signalling cascades coordinating cellular responses to help maintain plant cell-wall integrity  <cit> . this is the case for potri.003g <dig> encoding the respiratory burst oxidase homolog d, responsible in arabidopsis for apoplast ros production  <cit>  or for genes encoding calcium-related proteins such as calcium-binding ef-hand family protein , calmodulin-binding protein  or cbl-interacting protein kinase .

discussion
short- and long-term impacts of transient stem bending on transcriptional responses in poplar
lee et al. studying the transcriptomic effect of a touch stimulus at a single time-point  in the herbaceous arabidopsis showed that the expression of over  <dig> % of the arabidopsis genome was up-regulated at least twofold  <cit> . here, in poplar, a single transitory bending modulated the expression of about 6% of the genome over  <dig> time-points, and strikingly, the majority of changes in gene expression were observed within the first two hours post-bending. such massive early response has been seen in other transcriptomic time-course studies of responses to stress . moreover, at  <dig>  h pb, genes are mainly up-regulated . a high proportion of these early-regulated genes showed no differential regulation at 2 h pb and thereafter. the transcripts they produce could be classified as unstable transcripts according to gutierrez et al.  <cit> . actually, about 20% of the unstable transcripts described by these authors were up-regulated at  <dig>  h pb in our experiment .

our study illustrates the massive extent of transcriptomic changes in response to a non-wounding mechanical stimulus, but also sheds new light on the duration and dynamics of the phenomenon. the refinement of the time-course by qpcr for  <dig> candidate genes brought key insight by revealing unexpected short or long-lasting expression profiles. notably, this analysis highlighted a high number of early-induced genes presenting inhibited expression at later time-points. this suggests the existence of an active negative feedback mechanism.

a rapid activation of defence signalling
the association of a go term enrichment analysis with a clustering approach enabled us to distinguish different major components of the response. numerous clusters are enriched with genes related to plant responses to stimuli, either biotic or abiotic. a majority of these genes were differentially expressed at early time-points, showing the ability of trees to react rapidly to mechanical stimuli by modifying the expression of genes involved in the general response to abiotic stresses. these genes encompassed for example an ortholog of the pia <dig> pp2c protein phosphatase known to regulate defence responses both positively and negatively in arabidopsis  <cit> , and an ortholog of the arabidopsis camta <dig> calmodulin-binding tf, which was recently shown to regulate amplitude of rapid stress response element  peak activity in the general stress response, “the initial rapid cascade preceding the induction of consequent stress-specific signalling activities”  <cit> .

in plants, abiotic stresses usually trigger the accumulation of ros and increase the expression of scavenging enzyme-encoding genes  <cit> . here, early responses to bending also included the regulation of genes related to ros scavenging, such as several peroxidase-encoding genes, or ptagrx <dig> , a member of the glutaredoxin family that regulates protein redox state. it is known that plants can respond to stresses by a coordinated modulation of chloroplast and nuclear gene expression. such rapid acclimation of plant cell metabolism and photosynthetic machinery is considered a key factor for plant survival. here, the expression of several genes involved in chloroplast function or development was down-regulated for several hours after the bending. to our knowledge, these results are the first evidence of coordinated modulation following a non-wounding mechanical stimulus.

taken together, these data suggest that in trees, a transient non-wounding mechanical treatment also quickly activates defence-signalling pathways.

previous studies have argued that ca2+ may be involved in plant responses to mechanical stimuli  <cit> . accordingly, several genes encoding proteins related to calcium such as calmodulins, calcineurin b-like calcium sensor proteins  and autoinhibited ca2+-atpases  were also deregulated in poplar stem tissues after bending. the long-term maintenance of the induced expression of ptaaca <dig> suggests its role in maintaining ca2+ homeostasis thereby preventing cell injuries or maintaining ca2+ second messenger functions.

plant hormones are known to play major roles in development and defence against biotic and abiotic stresses, so it was unsurprising to find concomitant modifications in expression of genes related to defence and to hormones at early time-points. in arabidopsis, ethylene and ja are known to strongly contribute to the mechanical signalling pathway in the first-stage responses. many of the genes studied here encode tf related to ethylene signalling and many others encode proteins involved in ja biosynthesis  or ja signalling . these observations suggest ja and ethylene are central to mechanoresponse in the poplar model tree, just as they are in ruderal herbs such as arabidopsis thaliana.

stem bending elicits transcriptional responses linked to cell wall modification and/or wood development
poplar stem bending caused a complete cessation of cambial growth during the first hours  <cit> . the coincidence of early growth cessation in bent poplar and transitory overexpression of genes related to plant defence is consistent with the reported antagonism between plant immunity and growth  <cit> . in this tradeoff, hormones, especially ja, play a significant role. after the early phase of growth cessation, cambial growth increases during  <dig> to 5 days before resuming a normal rate of growth. in our study,  <dig> probesets revealed an increased expression of ribosomal protein-encoding genes at the 24 h pb time-point, which was further confirmed by the clustering approach with cluster  <dig> showing an enrichment of go terms related to ribosomes. sustained accelerated growth, as observed in bent poplar, is heavily reliant on an efficient supply of proteins by the cell machinery  <cit> . thus, the effect of bending on the expression of genes encoding ribosomal protein could accompany the strong metabolic activity necessary for accelerated cambial growth.

although early responses of poplar to a bending stimulus seem to apply to defence and growth, this transcriptomic study indicated that later responses strongly affect cell wall and/or wood development. indeed, a significant portion of cell wall-related genes displayed differential expression at different time-points. fla genes were up-regulated at 2 h and 72 h pb while some nac and myb encoding genes, known to be part of the transcriptional network that regulates secondary cell formation and wood cell differentiation  <cit> , were first down-regulated at  <dig>  h then up-regulated at 72 h pb. moreover, the most highly induced gene corresponded to a homolog of arabidopsis xtr <dig>  a xth. in the cell wall, these proteins are thought to specifically catalyse the endolytic cleavage and re-ligation of xyloglucan chains, thus allowing adjustments of cell wall mechanical properties. these observations may indicate the existence of a two-phase process:  a relatively rapid response that might be interpreted as a way for plants to modulate growth through adjustment of the expansibility of the primary cell wall followed by  a later response that may set up tissue differentiation and changes in properties to enable acclimation to the encountered mechanical stress. indeed, multiple stem bendings in poplar were previously shown to modify the mechanical properties  of the stems  <cit> . until now, ptazfp <dig> was the only protein putatively involved in such modifications  <cit> . our study thus represents a first tentative molecular explanation for this two-phase effect of bending loads.

a single mechanical stimulus is sufficient to attenuate plant responsiveness to recurrent stimulus
in natural conditions, wind triggers successive bendings of aerial axes. in a previous study, we demonstrated that plants reduce their responsiveness to mechanical signals as a function of their mechanical history —a phenomenon named accommodation  <cit> . here, we aimed to unravel the impact of repeated stem bending at genome-wide level by comparing the magnitude of transcriptional responses between two successive bendings and a single bending of the stem. this kinetics is intended to mimic the alternation between windy and quiet days observed in temperate climates  <cit>  more than the frequencies  at which plants oscillate in wind  <cit> . our transcriptomic results highlighted the existence of three classes of transcriptional response patterns.

first, the huge majority of these early mechanoresponsive genes  presented a smaller amplitude of regulation  <dig>  h after the second bending. furthermore, the data showed that most of these early-regulated genes returned to their basal expression levels at 24 h pb, at the time when the second bending was applied. the attenuation of transcriptional responses to the second bending thus probably results from a reduction in transcriptional responsiveness and not from saturation of the transcriptional machinery. these data suggest a global desensitization of the first stages of the mechanotransduction pathway.

the description of genes presenting altered responses to successive stimulations has been made elsewhere for other stresses. for example, ding et al. used rna-seq analysis to classify drought-responsive genes as “memory genes” or “non-memory” genes as a function of their transcriptional responses to two successive dehydration treatments  <cit> . plants can record repeated stimulus and respond in consequence, a phenomena named “attenuation”, “stress imprint” or, as here, “accommodation”. however, contrary to mechanical stem loading, responses are usually enhanced after a second exposure in most of the studies  <cit> . whereas gene priming and transcriptional memory are classically thought to help provide an increased, or at least improved, response to a biotic or abiotic stress, accommodation mostly switches off or attenuates the response. such fine-tuning of the mechanotransduction pathway could help prevent unnecessary thigmomorphogenetic growth reductions while still allowing the plant to become more resistant  to the stimulus.

two unexpected categories of transcriptional responses were observed in our study:  the “newly-regulated” genes , whose expression was only regulated after the second stimulation, and  the “non-accommodated” genes , i.e. mechanoresponsive genes that respond similarly to the first and the second stimulus. these data raise the question of the nature of a mechanism, or set of mechanisms, involved in this phenomenon without affecting all the mechanoresponsive genes similarly. as stated in  <cit> , several hypotheses can be put forward: alteration of perception through direct modification of mechanosensors, or a negative feedback control on the mechanotransduction pathway . the existence of three types of expression profiles makes the hypothesis of a direct control on mechanosensors difficult to consider, except if several types of mechanosensors are involved. interestingly, a recent study suggested a putative role for feronia in mechanosensing  <cit> . however, it also revealed that the pattern of cytoplasmic changes in  observed after a mechanical stimulation cannot be explained solely by feronia, which requires other mechanosensors to be involved. in our case, 10% of the “non-accommodated” genes encode proteins possessing a kinase domain, among which the poplar orthologous gene of feronia. the non-accommodation of these genes could be a way for the cells to help record recurrent stimuli or to fine-tune cell sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. however, the hypothesis of an active negative feedback control at the transcriptional level also needs to be explored, as suggested by the active inhibition of expression observed at later time-points for most of the early-induced genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this genome-wide study of poplar transcriptional responsiveness to bending brings a novel temporal dimension to our knowledge of plant responses to mechanical stimuli. moreover, it highlights the extent of the accommodation process and the existence of diverse gene regulation types in response to recurring mechanically stressing events. the identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms opens news perspectives for gaining deeper understanding of how the intensity and recurrence of a stimulus affect plant growth and development. we anticipate this study as a start point to the generation of predictive models of the gene regulatory networks mediating poplar transcriptional responses to mechanical stimulation.
