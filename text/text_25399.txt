BACKGROUND
the morphogenesis of the plant body is a developmental process that continues throughout the entire lifespan of the plant. different morphologies in different plant lineages are dependent on developmental differences that have a molecular basis in the function and/or expression of regulatory genes. in seed plants major patterning events take place during embryo development, the embryo is polarised with an apical shoot meristem, giving rise to all above ground parts, and a basal root meristem, giving rise to the root system. the specification of the body plan during embryogenesis requires the coordination of cell fates according to their position along the embryo axis, from the apical to the basal part. during post-embryonic development new organs are formed successively from the shoot- and root meristems at the same time as the meristems are maintained. the genetic control of patterning and morphogenesis during plant development is dependent on a large number of genes. many aspects of the molecular regulation of plant development have been analysed, primarily in the model angiosperm species arabidopsis thaliana, whereas very little is known in plant species outside the angiosperms.

in angiosperms members of the wuschel-related homeobox  gene family play important roles determining cell fates during plant development. the wox gene family is characterised by the phylogenetic relationship of the homeodomain of these genes. it is present only in the “green” lineage comprising land plants and green algae. the number of wox genes present in the genomes of different species correlates to some degree with the complexity of the species body pattern. only one wox gene is found in the genomes of the green micro algae ostreococcus tauri and o. lucimarinus, three wox genes are present in the genome of the moss physcomitrella patens, nine in the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii, whereas the genome of a. thaliana contains  <dig> wox genes. phylogenetic analyses have divided the wox gene family into three major clades  <cit> . only one clade contains genes from early diverging plants, e.g. the moss p. patens, as well as the green algae o. tauri and o. lucimarinus, and this clade is therefore referred to as the ancient clade  <cit> . the ancient clade also contains representatives from a. thaliana, namely atwox <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the other two clades are termed the intermediate clade, containing atwox <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the modern clade, containing atwus and atwox1- <dig> <cit> .

the role of the wox genes during plant development has been studied to some detail in a. thaliana as well as in petunia hybrida, zea mays and oryza sativa . the founding member of the gene family, a. thaliana wuschel , has been shown to act in the organising centre of the shoot apical meristem  to maintain the stem cell population  <cit> . a similar role has been proposed for atwox <dig> in the root apical meristem  <cit>  and for atwox <dig> in the cambial meristem  <cit> . other wox genes have been implicated in the patterning and morphogenesis of the early embryo, e.g. atwox <dig>  atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> <cit>  and in regulating flower development and/or inflorescence architecture, e.g. atwox <dig>  atwox <dig>  atwox <dig> and p. hybrida evergreen  and sister of evergreen   <cit> . the wox genes function as transcriptional regulators and at least some can act as both activators and repressors depending on tissue type or developmental stage  <cit> . furthermore, all wox genes examined show very specific expression patterns, both spatially and temporally, which are important for their functions . several studies suggest that the wox gene family may be involved in the evolution of developmental processes  <cit> . thus, analysis of the tissue specific expression of wox genes is of interest to elucidate similarities and differences in the regulatory mechanisms of plant development also in species outside the angiosperms.

the wox genes in o. tauri  and p. patens , all belonging to the ancient clade, have been shown to be constitutively expressed in all tissues and at all developmental stages analysed  <cit> . the a. thaliana ancient clade genes atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> are also expressed in most tissues and developmental stages , although the expression pattern is limited to certain cells within an organ  <cit> . in the conifer picea abies the intermediate clade gene pawox8/ <dig> has been shown to be preferentially expressed during embryo development  <cit> . furthermore, the p. abies modern clade gene pawox <dig> was shown to have a similar expression pattern as pawox8/ <dig> <cit> . the a. thaliana genes atwox <dig> and atwox <dig>  which belong to the intermediate clade are expressed in specific domains from the first cell division of the proembryo until the end of embryogenesis and the same is true for the a. thaliana modern clade gene atwox <dig> <cit> . in the fern ceratopteris richardii it has been shown that crwul, a gene with strong similarity to atwus, is expressed in the shoot meristem  <cit> . another atwus homolog, ggwus from the gymnosperm gnetum gnemon, is expressed in both the root and shoot meristems. furthermore, heterologous expression of ggwus in a. thaliana confers the same phenotype as the overexpression of atwus <cit> . thus, although little is known about the wox genes outside the angiosperms most studies have revealed extensive similarities, at least with regard to gene expression, suggesting a conserved function for these genes. however, the shoot specific expression of wus and root specific expression of wox <dig> seem to be specific to angiosperms as the gymnosperm wus homologs ggwus, ginkgo biloba wus , and pinus sylvestris wus  were shown to be expressed in both the shoot and the root  <cit> . furthermore, nardmann et al.  could only detect one homolog of wus/wox <dig> in these gymnosperms suggesting that the wus and wox <dig> genes are the result of an angiosperm specific gene duplication  <cit> .

in this paper we present an analysis of the wox gene family in the conifer p. abies. we have identified  <dig> wox homologs and analysed the phylogenetic relationship of these genes to other known wox genes. our phylogenetic analyses have identified one member of the ancient clade and several members in the intermediate and modern clades. the p. abies wox genes of the intermediate clade group together apart from the angiosperm genes, whereas there are clear p. abies orthologs of most angiosperm modern clade genes. furthermore, we have analysed the expression of the different wox genes in different tissues and developmental stages with a special focus on somatic embryo development.

RESULTS
cloning and phylogeny of p. abies wox genes
we have successfully isolated  <dig> p. abies wox genes using degenerate primers targeting the homeodomain. the isolated homeodomain sequences were extended by genome walking to acquire the full genomic sequences . each genomic locus was then cloned using gene specific primers to confirm the genome walking and the exon-intron pattern was predicted. the gene structure of the isolated genes is presented in figure  <dig>  two of these genes have been described as cdnas earlier, namely pawox <dig> and pawox8/ <dig> <cit> . the p. abies wox genes were named according to their closest homolog in a. thaliana as indicated by phylogenetic analyses  except for pawox8a, pawox8b, pawox8c, and pawox8d, which were named after atwox <dig>  which is the a. thaliana gene in the intermediate clade with the lowest number, and a-d because the p. abies genes are more similar to each other  than they are to any a. thaliana genes. due to long introns we were not able to amplify the full-length genomic sequence of pawox <dig> by either genome walking or with gene specific primers, thus the gene model is made from a combination of genomic and transcript data and lacks sequence in both introns .

we have cloned transcripts containing a full coding sequence for all genes except for pawus, pawox8c and pawox8d for which we could not detect any transcripts in the tissues analysed. according to our predictions these latter three genes have intact open reading frames , although the predicted pawus intron is more than 2 kb and contains repetitive sequences . we were not able to detect any transcript of pawus using primers targeting either the homeobox alone or targeting the entire orf.

to put the p. abies wox genes in a phylogenetic context the homeodomain sequences from the p. abies wox genes were aligned to a subset of homeodomain sequences from other wox genes. we included sequences from green algae, bryophytes, lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms and used two different phylogenetic methods and both nucleotide and protein alignments to infer the phylogeny. the analyses showed good support for the three major clades of wox genes, the ancient clade, intermediate clade, and modern clade . however, there was some uncertainty as to the placement of the fern sequences crwoxa and crwoxb in the intermediate clade since the support is quite low, especially in the maximum likelihood  analyses. according to the phylogenetic analysis there was one p. abies representative in the ancient clade, pawox <dig>  and several representatives of the intermediate clade  and the modern clade  . in order to be able to elucidate the relationships in the intermediate and modern clades in more detail new sub-trees including only members from the respective clades were generated using additional sequence outside the homeodomain .

in the intermediate clade there were no clear p. abies orthologs to the angiosperm sequences . the ml analysis using nucleotide sequences supported a monophyletic group for the p. abies genes  whereas the other methods suggested a division into two sub-clades. there was good support for the monophyly of the genes in the clade containing atwox <dig> and  <dig> . however, the atwox <dig> and  <dig> genes, as well as the phevg, phsoe and vvwox <dig> genes, did not show a monophyletic relationship. it is therefore difficult, with this limited data set, to conclude if the p. abies genes are more closely related to atwox <dig> and  <dig>  closer to atwox <dig> and  <dig>  or if they should group as sister to the angiosperm sequences.

in the modern clade there was almost a complete set of orthologous sequences to the a. thaliana sequences . the support was good for the orthology of pawus and atwus, as well as for pawox <dig> and atwox <dig>  the support was not very strong, but the topology and number of genes still support the orthology of pawox <dig> and atwox <dig>  pawox <dig> and atwox <dig>  and pawox <dig> and atwox <dig>  the only modern clade a. thaliana sequences we did not find orthologs for in p. abies were atwox <dig>  atwox <dig> and atwox <dig>  the support for the orthology of pawox <dig> and atwox <dig> was rather strong in the full wox gene tree  but not as strong in the modern clade sub-tree . the monophyly of the wox <dig> clade had a low support in the full wox gene tree . in the modern clade sub-tree there was no support for the monophyly of the wox <dig> genes. although the monophyly is in question pawox <dig> still groups closer to atwox <dig> than to any other a. thaliana wox gene. the support for pawox <dig> to group with atwox <dig> was not very strong . however, there was good support for the wus/wox <dig> sub-clade  including all wus and wox <dig> orthologs from the different species.

expression of wox genes in p. abies
in order to get a better understanding of where the p. abies wox genes are active we analysed their expression in different tissues and at various developmental stages using quantitative real-time pcr  . pawox8/ <dig> was mainly expressed during embryo development although some expression could be detected outside the embryo at very low levels . pawox <dig> and pawox8a showed a very specific expression pattern with expression only detectable in proembryogenic masses  and late embryos . no expression was detected in early or mature embryos. pawox8a expression could also be detected in young needles although this expression was extremely low. thus, pawox <dig>  pawox8a and pawox8/ <dig> are all more or less embryo specific. pems were the only tissue where we could detect expression of pawox8b . the high sequence similarity between pawox8b, c, and d made it very difficult to design gene specific primers, therefor the expression we detected could potentially also include pawox8c and d and not only b. however, we cloned and sequenced several qpcr products  and they all corresponded to pawox8b.

the highest expression of pawox <dig> was detected in mature embryos and shoot tips whereas a very low expression was detected in pems, early embryos and root tips . pawox <dig> showed expression in all tissues analysed with a maximum in shoot tips and cambium . pawox <dig> expression was only detected in mature embryos, shoot tips and root tips . interestingly, pawox <dig> was the only gene not expressed in pems. pawox <dig> expression was detected in all tissues analysed . the expression was somewhat higher in old needles  and in cambial tissue whereas the expression levels in other tissues seemed to be very similar.

discussion
previous studies of the wox gene family in plants have identified three major clades; the ancient clade with representatives from all lineages of land plants as well as green algae, and the intermediate and modern clades with representatives found only in ferns and seed plants  <cit> . in our study we have identified  <dig> p. abies wox genes representing all major clades of wox genes. only one p. abies gene groups into the ancient clade , pawox <dig>  which is in accordance to what has been reported for other gymnosperms   <cit> . at this point we cannot exclude the existence of additional genes of the ancient clade in gymnosperms. we could detect expression of pawox <dig> in all tissues tested, both during embryogenesis and in more adult tissues. the ancient clade genes atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> from a. thaliana are expressed in most tissues, although there is no clear expression data from the embryo stage  <cit> . thus at this scale of resolution the expression patterns of the ancient clade genes are similar in p. abies compared to a. thaliana, i.e. a general expression in most tissues.

we could identify five different genes belonging to the intermediate clade . the phylogenetic analyses show that these genes group very closely even though there is not enough support to confirm if they are monophyletic or not . several of the p. abies intermediate clade genes are very similar to each other, i.e. pawox8b-d, especially in the coding regions , suggesting that they are the result of very recent gene duplications. we could identify at least two different sequence variants of each gene, which we believe are allelic . therefore we cannot exclude the existence of more intermediate clade genes in p. abies. based on this we suggest that the p. abies intermediate clade genes are the result of an expansion that happened after the split between gymnosperms and angiosperms. interestingly, we could find at least four different est sequences from pinus taeda in genbank  belonging to the intermediate clade. phylogenetic analyses group these genes within the p. abies intermediate clade genes suggesting that the expansion might be common to species within the pinaceae family . whether this is common also to other gymnosperm lineages is still an open question.

pawox8a and pawox8/ <dig> show expression preferentially during embryo development with only a very low expression for pawox8/ <dig> in non-embryo tissues. these expression patterns could be compared with those for atwox <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> since the phylogenetic analyses do not conclusively show which of these a. thaliana gene are the closest homologs of the p. abies genes. atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> are expressed during embryo development from very early stages and throughout development  <cit> . atwox <dig> expression is very low outside the embryo whereas atwox <dig> is expressed also in more adult tissues where it is involved in the maintenance of the sam  <cit> . the expression of atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> has so far not been described in any detail but array data suggest that at least atwox <dig> is expressed during embryo development . thus, the expression of pawox8/ <dig> and pawox8a seems to be comparable to the a. thaliana intermediate clade genes although their expression is more limited to embryo development. furthermore, the before mentioned p. taeda est sequences were all derived from embryogenic tissues, which might suggest that the embryo specific function of these genes is common within the pinaceae family. pawox8b expression was only detected in pems, which is a very specific tissue type for embryogenic cell cultures and therefor we do not know if the gene has any specific function during the life cycle of the plant. we could not detect any expression of pawox8c and d, which might suggest that these genes are inactive pseudogenes. however, there is nothing in the genomic sequences of these loci to support this notion. taken together, pawox8b-d might all be silenced, or at least partially silenced, recent copies of either pawox8a or pawox8/ <dig> 

our phylogenetic analyses identified an almost complete set of orthologous sequences in the modern clade between p. abies and a. thaliana. the only a. thaliana sequences we could not find orthologs of were: atwox <dig>  atwox <dig> and atwox <dig>  atwox <dig> is most likely the result of a very recent duplication in the a. thaliana lineage since atwox <dig> and atwox <dig> are more closely related to each other than to wox <dig> orthologs from o. sativa or v. vinifera . the lack of orthologous sequences to atwox <dig> and  <dig> might be because we were unable to amplify them with our primers, alternatively there has been either an angiosperm specific diversification or a gymnosperm specific gene loss.

the orthology of pawox <dig> with atwox <dig> is well supported in the full wox tree  whereas the support is lower in the modern clade sub-tree . in a. thaliana atwox <dig> is expressed during embryo development and at low levels outside the embryo  <cit> . this is similar to the pattern seen for pawox <dig> . however, in a previous study pawox <dig> was shown to be expressed both in embryos and seedlings  <cit> . we could recapitulate the results by palovaara & hakman  <cit>  when using the same primers as they used whereas our primers only detected expression in pems and late embryos . these differences might seem strange at first but the main difference between our primers and the primers of palovaara & hakman  <cit>  is that one of our primers spans an exon-intron boundary and does not amplify genomic dna or unspliced transcripts whereas the primers of palovaara & hakman  <cit>  are situated within the same exon and therefore cannot discriminate between processed and unprocessed transcript or genomic dna . it will be interesting to learn if the difference between our results and those of palovaara & hakman  is due to that pawox <dig> is regulated post-transcriptionally.

the orthology of pawox <dig> and atwox <dig> is well supported , which is suggestive of a conserved function for these genes in the different lineages. we could detect expression of pawox <dig> mainly in shoot tips and mature embryos, which, at this level of resolution, is similar to the expression reported for atwox <dig> as well as for a z. mays wox <dig> ortholog  <cit> .

in our phylogenetic analyses the wox <dig> clade has the lowest support . furthermore, we could not find a clear wus-box in the deduced pawox <dig> protein . however, since atwox <dig> is the closest a. thaliana homolog we named the p. abies gene in this clade pawox <dig>  the expression of pawox <dig> is not limited to any particular tissue types, rather we could detect expression in most tissues. interestingly, high expression was detected in the cambium, which might suggest that the function of wox <dig> as a regulator of the cambial meristem is conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms.

in contrast to other analysed gymnosperms   <cit>  we found sequences grouping with both wus and wox <dig> . the phylogenetic support for the wus clade, including pawus, is good , and is further supported by the fact that the pawus protein sequence contains an extra amino acid residue in the homeodomain, which is specific to proteins in the wus clade  <cit> . in angiosperm wus proteins, as well as in pawus and gbwus, this extra amino acid is a tyrosine whereas it is a histidine in ggwus and the fern sequences crwul and cawul  <cit> . the pawox <dig> and pswus proteins on the other hand contain no extra amino acid, consistent with them not being wus orthologs, but rather orthologous to wox <dig>  thus, the results presented here together with previous analyses  <cit> , suggest that the gene duplication leading to distinct wus and wox <dig> genes predates the gymnosperm-angiosperm split. although our data support the notion that there was both a wus and wox <dig> ortholog present in the last common ancestor of angiosperms and gymnosperms it might not mean that the division of function between the apical meristems of shoots and roots was present. expression of njwus, from the basal angiosperm nymphea jamesoniana, has only been detected in the shoot  <cit>  whereas expression of the gymnosperm genes ggwus and pawox <dig> has been detected in both shoot tips and root tips . this suggests that the subfunctionalisation of wus and wox <dig> took place at the base of the angiosperm lineage after the split between angiosperms and gymnosperms. it is interesting to note that in g. biloba and g. gnemon it is the wus ortholog that is expressed whereas the existence of a wox <dig> ortholog is uncertain  <cit>  and in the conifers p. sylvestris <cit>  and p. abies it is the wox <dig> ortholog that is transcribed and we could not find any expression of the wus ortholog. further investigations aimed at understanding the tissue specific expression and function of the gymnosperm wus/wox <dig> genes might reveal specific functions for these genes in gymnosperms compared to angiosperms and if there are differences within the gymnosperms.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here show that the major diversifications within the wox gene family happened before the split between angiosperms and gymnosperms approximately  <dig> million years ago. together with previous studies it confirms the dynamic patterns and lineage specific evolutionary trajectories within certain branches of the wox gene tree. first, it shows that there has been an independent expansion of the intermediate clade in the pinaceae family. second, it shows that there are clear orthologs of both wus and wox <dig> present in the gymnosperm p. abies. thus, further investigations into the specific function of these genes might give insights into lineage specific developmental and morphogenetic differences.
