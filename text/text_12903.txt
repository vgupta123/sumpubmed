BACKGROUND
ovarian epithelial carcinoma is one of the most common gynecological malignancies encountered in the clinic. it has a biological behavior of metastasis initiated at an early stage and rapidly spread over the peritoneal cavity. published literatures revealed that the immune deficiency in tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer, and also influences the disease progression, and overall survival rate . one evidence to support the above statement is that the matured myloid dcs , which are considered as the most potent antigen-presentation cells, infiltrate rarely into the tumor site in the patients with ovarian carcinoma. of note, mdcs play an important role in promoting immune response, while the plasmcytoid dcs  are oppositely to promote immune escape .

it is known that mdc precursors would probably present as lin-cd45ra- cells because no specific surface markers such as cd45ra were expressed and lineage negative. however, each dc subtypes have the potential ability to differentiate through either myeloid or lymphoid-lineages and the dc development is quite flexible rather than their lineage restriction  <cit> . in our previous study, we cultured such precursors that generated from cd34+ human progenitor cells  with gm-csf and tnf-α in the ovarian carcinoma microenvironment. then, we observed that the lin-cd45ra- dc precursors differentiated into more pdcs than mdcs, which indicated that it may favor tumor progression  <cit> . however, the mechanism is still unclear.

notch proteins  constitute a group of highly conserved transmembrane receptors that regulate cell fate decision during the development of many mammalian cell lineages. a lot of studies have provided much data on the critically important role of the notch pathway in the differentiation of myeloid cells. recent studies also confirmed the expression of notch protein in antigen presentation cells and matured dc  <cit> . more and more papers concluded that notch pathway is associated with dc differentiation. but the conclusions were controversial  <cit> . cheng et al. described that the differentiation of dc in notch- <dig> anti-sense mice was significantly down-regulated that only half of the normal level of notch-1were expressed in hpc  <cit> . yet, radtke et al. found that in notch- <dig> conditional knockout mice, the thymic dcs, conventional dcs, and langerhans cells were in normal level  <cit> .

based on our previous research works, the current study is aimed to address the expression of notch <dig> in lin-cd45ra-dc precursors, and then to illustrate the relationship between notch <dig> and differentiation of the precursors in vitro.

methods
ovarian carcinoma cell line culture and collection of supernatants
an epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell line skov <dig> was purchased from american type culture collection. skov <dig> was cultured in mccoy'5a  with 15 % fbs and passaged when confluent with  <dig>  % trypsin. when cells grew to about 80 % of bottle plat, the medium was changed by rpmi  <dig> supplemented with 15 % fbs for  <dig> h. the supernatants were collected for future use.

isolation and enlargement of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors
normal human cord blood was collected immediately from the full term deliveries, according to the institution guideline. informed consents were obtained from all volunteers. cd34+ hpcs were isolated from cord blood by magnetic cell separation  with the use of anti-cd34 − mab-conjugated immunomagnetic beads  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. more than 95 % of the isolated cells expressed cd <dig> when analyzed by flow cytometry . enriched cd34+ hpc  were cultured in rpmi  <dig> supplemented with 15 % fbs, penicillin , and streptomycin . cells were maintained at  <dig> °c in a 5 % co <dig> humidified atmosphere for  <dig> days in the presence of recombined human cytokines  flt-3l  and scf , could only expand but not influence the differentiation of the precursors <cit> , for enlargement. half the culture medium and cytokines were renewed every  <dig> days. expanded progenitor cells were then collected for sorting dc precursors. in brief, cells were incubated with -conjugated lineage cocktail  <dig>  for  <dig> min in  <dig> °c. after washed with buffer solution and incubated with anti-fitc microbeads  for  <dig> min in  <dig> °c, cells were isolated by automatic macs. lin  <dig> contains monoclonal antibody  clones against cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , and cd <dig> , cd <dig> . after isolation all these cells were removed. then by using cd45ra microbeads , lin-cd45ra- cells were obtained. more than 95 % of these isolated cells were lin-cd45ra- when analyzed by flow cytometry.

treatment by γ-secretase inhibitor
dapt  acetyl]-l-alanyl-2-phenyl] glycine- <dig> -dimethylethyl) is a kind of gsi. it was bought from sigma . in the culture of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors, dapt was added in the culture system to inhibit the notch pathway with initial cell density of 5 × 105/ml, at concentrations of  <dig>  to 20μm. dimethyl sulfoxide   was added to the cell culture system as control. notch <dig> mrna expression was detected by qrt-pcr after cells were cultured with dapt or dmso for  <dig> h.

induced maturation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors in different culture condition
after being treated in different conditions, lin-cd45ra- dc precursors, shrna-notch <dig> transfected cells and cells treated by dapt were all seeded in 24-well plate separately by a density of 1-5 × 105/ml in  <dig> μl rpmi  <dig> plus gm-csf  and tnf-α  for another  <dig> days culture.

RESULTS
notch <dig> receptors and ligands were detected by rt-pcr in lin-cd45ra- dc precursors
in the lin-cd45ra- dc precursors developed from cd34+ cells, we can detect the expression of notch <dig> receptors and their ligands, jagged  <dig>  jagged  <dig>  and delta  <dig> ligands. among them,notch <dig> receptor and jagged <dig> ligand had high expressions, while expressions of jagged <dig> and delta <dig> were much lower .fig.  <dig> real time pcr analysis of notch  <dig>  jagged <dig>   <dig> and delta <dig> in lin-cd45ra- dc precursors 



notch <dig> was knocked down by shrna
the shrna-notch <dig> lentiviral expression vector was constructed and we used it to transfect the lin-cd45ra-dc precursors . the lin-cd45ra-dc cells had fluorescence after 24h lentivirus infection. the fluorescence demonstrated high transfection efficiency of over 90 % at 72h  .fig.  <dig> both pictures showed lin-cd45ra- cells, however the left picture 24h after transfection and the right picture 72h after transfection 



the relative expressions of notch <dig> mrna in the following groups of blank group, negative control group and shrna-notch <dig> group after 72h lentivirus infection were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively. the relative expressions of notch <dig> mrna after 96h lentivirus infection were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively. as compared to the blank group and negative control group, the shrna-notch <dig> lentiviral expression vector significantly down regulated the expression of notch <dig> mrna in lin-cd45ra-dc cells. however, there was no significant difference between the shrna-notch  <dig> lentiviral groups after 72h lentivirus infection and after 96h lentivirus infection  . in the following experiment, we used the cells after 72h lentivirus infection.fig.  <dig> real-time pcr showed that notch <dig> mrna level significantly decreased after 72h/96h of lentvirus infection in lin-cd45ra-dc precursors. **p <  <dig> 



notch <dig> was knocked down by gsi
moreover, we also used dapt to block the notch <dig> signaling. according to the experiment, the expression of notch <dig> mrna was significantly reduced after treated with a certain concentration  at 72h. as a result, cells treated with 10μm dapt had significant inhibition on notch <dig> expression .fig.  <dig> the mrna relative expression of notch <dig> after treated with dapt for 72h . with the increased concentration of dapt, the expression of notch <dig> decreased till the concentration increased to 20um. the concentration of 10μm showed the greatest inhibitory effect

notch  <dig> knockdown influenced the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors without skov <dig> cultured supernatants
we used 3-colour flow cytometry to analyze the differentiation of lin-cd45ra- dc precursors in different conditions. as a result, after lentivirus transfection of shrna-notch <dig>  when compared with control group, lin-cd45ra-dc precursors differentiated into more hla-dr + cd11c + cd123- mdcs and less hla-dr + cd11c-cd123+ pdcs .

as we showed above, dapt down regulated the expression of notch <dig> mrna level. but when compared with control group, the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors to mdcs in dapt group was almost the same . instead, significant decrease of pdcs was detected. the proportion of pdcs after gsi treating was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, and in control group was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % . there were no significant differences in the differentiation to either mdc or pdc between the shrna group and gsi group  .

notch  <dig> knockdown influenced the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors within skov <dig> cultured supernatants
we have shown previously that skov <dig> cultured supernatants decreased the number of mdcs and increased the number of pdcs during the differential process of lin-cd45ra-dc precursors. in order to verify the relationship of notch <dig> signaling and the differentiation of dc precursors in the ovarian cancer microenvironment, we added skov <dig> cultured supernatants into different dc precursor culture system.

when the dc-precursors were treated with skov <dig> supernatants, the differentiation to mdcs could also be significantly increased by shrna-notch <dig> , but not by dapt . however, the differentiation to pdcs could be significantly reduced by both shrna and dapt . there were no significant differences in the differentiation to either mdc or pdc between the shrna group and gsi group  .fig.  <dig>

il- <dig> concentrations in vitro
il- <dig> is a dc-derived factor that directs the development of th <dig> immune reaction. the capacity of dcs to produce bioactive il-12p <dig> was detected and compared between groups treated with and without skov3-supernatants.

in the groups without skov3-supernatants, after treated with either shrna or dapt, the secretion of il- <dig> significantly increased as compared with the control group  .fig.  <dig> il- <dig> concentrations in three culture supernatants without skov <dig> culture supernatants . both shrna and gsi mediated notch  <dig> knock down significantly produced more il- <dig> compared to control group

discussion
there were three main findings of this study. firstly, notch <dig> and all the notch family ligands were expressed in lin-cd45ra-dc precursors. secondly, the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursor cells to pdcs can be reduced after knocking down notch <dig> by both shrna and dapt, and this process would not be affected by the supernatant of the ovarian carcinoma cell line. thirdly, the secretion of il- <dig> significantly increased after knocking down notch <dig> with or without the supernatants of skov <dig> cell line.

the previous studies, which explored the close relationship between notch family and dcs differentiation, were controversial. it mainly concentrated on the following aspects. on the one hand, it is still not clear whether notch <dig> would be a promotion or inhibition role in the differentiation of the dcs. hoshino n et al. reported that notch signaling was found to promote peripheral blood monocyte precursors differentiate to dcs and langerhans cells  <cit> . however, de smedt et al. found that inhibition of notch signaling with γ-secretase inhibitor shifted differentiation into non-t cells including monocyte or dendritic cells  <cit> . similar contradictory data exists in respect to the effect of notch signaling on pdcs. oliver et al. reported that notch signaling via delta- <dig> promoted differentiation of pdc  <cit> . in a different study, stromal cells expressing delta- <dig> blocked pdc development  <cit> . on the other hand, which differentiation stage the notch <dig> signal pathway would take effect is still unknown. most studies were mainly focused on cd34+ hematopoietic progenitors and dcs stage. for instance,els waegemans et al. reported that blocking of notch <dig> signaling at the stage of cd34+ hematopoietic progenitors resulted in a complete block in t-lineage specification and induced monocytic and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  <cit> . however, another study, which repealed that microrna-23b promoted tolerogenic properties of dendritic cells in vitro through inhibiting notch1/nf-jb signalling pathways, was mainly focus on the mature dc stage  <cit> . additionally, the activation of notch <dig> signaling by different ligands was still controversial. cheng p et al. found that main notch ligands delta- <dig> and jagged- <dig> had the opposite effect on dc differentiation. delta- <dig> promoted generation of fully differentiated dcs, whereas jagged- <dig> stimulated accumulation of dc precursors but prevented their transition to terminally differentiated dcs  <cit> .

notably, our present study was mainly discussing about the notch <dig> expression in the lin-cd45ra-dc precursors stage and its function in the transformation of pdcs. as we know, pdcs play an important part in the mechnism of immune escape, while mdcs secreted il- <dig> would direct the development of th <dig> cells and be in favor of anti-cancer immunity. in this study, we observed that the amount of pdcs was decreased but the level of il- <dig> was increased in the supernatants of skov <dig> cell line after knocking down notch  <dig>  therefore, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that notch <dig> signaling inhibition may favor anti-tumor immune and it might provide a new target for immunotherapy of ovarian epithelial carcinoma.

another most important and bewildering problem is that we observed a significant increase in myeloid differentiation after knock-down of the notch <dig> by shrna, while no such effect was found in gsi mediated notch  <dig> knock-down. as a member of hydrolytic enzyme families, dapt can hydrolyze notch binding protein to block the notch signal, and is also considered to have the effect to down regulate the notch <dig> expression at the mrna level  <cit> . we speculate that there might be other influential factors in the differentiation of mdcs. therefore, further studies are still needed to confirm the differentiation mechanism of mdcs.

there are also some limitations in our study. for one thing, it may be appropriate to check for delta <dig> and jagged <dig> at the protein level for their activation to confirm the notch  <dig> pathway in the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dendritic cell precursors. for another, it would be much better to check the knockdown effects of the canonical notch target genes: myc, p <dig>  and the hes-family members. however, since cd34+ hematopoietic stem cells extracted from umbilical cord blood were relatively few, resulting in fewer lin-cd45ra-dc precursors, then it is really becoming difficulty to complete the experiment simultaneously. yet, it would be performed in our future experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we identified that notch <dig> and notch <dig> ligands were expressed in lin-cd45ra-dc precursors. notch <dig> is an important signaling pathway in the differentiation of lin-cd45ra-dc precursor cells to plasmcytoid dendritic cells . and this would not be affected by the supernatant of the ovarian carcinoma cell line. these findings might provide a new potential therapeutic target to ovarian cancer.
