BACKGROUND
multipartite mitochondrial genomes are common among plants  <cit> , but are quite rare among animals, the majority of which possess a single, 10–35 kb circular chromosome  <cit> . among insects, phthiraptera  <cit>  and psocoptera  <cit>  are the only two insect orders containing species with multipartite mitochondrial genomes. these orders, together with the hemiptera and thysanoptera, comprise the insect superorder paraneoptera.

thysanoptera contains ~ <dig> species of tiny , linear insects commonly known as thrips. the size and shape of thrips helps explain their significant representation on many invasive species lists and several species in this order are globally important crop pests  <cit> . scirtothrips dorsalis  is comprised of multiple cryptic species, two of which have established in the continental usa since  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> . these species originate from different parts of the world, have different climatic requirements and differ in host preference so discriminating between them at the molecular level is a high priority  <cit> . toward this end, the complete mitochondrial genomes of both recently adventive species, south asia  <dig>  and east asia  <dig> , were sequenced for comparative genomic analysis. this was done initially using next-generation sequencing  data, and subsequently validated using sanger sequencing. from these experiments, it was concluded that ea <dig> has a traditional single chromosome mitochondrial genome, while sa <dig> has a fragmented genome consisting of two chromosomes.

RESULTS
blast queries of ngs contigs identified all mitochondrial protein coding and ribosomal genes in both cryptic species except nad4l and atp <dig>  subsequent scaffolding of the ngs contigs of provisional mitochondrial origin yielded a completed circular mitochondrial chromosome for ea <dig>  but we were unable to circularize the sa <dig> genome using ngs data and instead inferred a single large chromosome by placing two short gap fillers consisting of ea <dig> sequence  into the inferred single sa <dig> chromosome prior to capillary sequencing validation. these fillers were on either side of a complete nad <dig> gene sequence. attempting to resolve the missing sequence in the sa <dig> genome surrounding the nad <dig> gene yielded an unexpected result. primers designed to span these gaps across the putative nad6/nad <dig> and nad6/rrnl gene boundaries failed , while the reverse complement of internal nad <dig> primers produced a pcr product . the lane  <dig> pcr reaction should only have yielded a product if the genome was fragmented with nad <dig> on a second mini-loop chromosome. furthermore, the sequence of this product was mitochondrial in origin, contained a control region  and also a trns <dig> gene . these paralogs were highly similar  to those in the larger, but nad <dig> and trnc deficient, mitochondrial chromosome. this experiment simultaneously validated the existence of a second non-redundant mitochondrial chromosome in the sa <dig> cryptic species of s. dorsalis  and confirmed the presence of all  <dig> mitochondrial genes in the sa <dig> genome. furthermore, the complete intervening sequence between nad <dig> and rrnl in the large sa <dig> chromosome was validated using capillary sequencing primers  and it was confirmed that no duplicate nad <dig> gene was present. this is the location of nad <dig> in all other thysanoptera including ea <dig>  in total, the mitochondrial genomes were validated using capillary sequencing covering  <dig>  % of the sa <dig> genome and  <dig>  % of the ea <dig> genome.fig.  <dig> confirming the mini-circle chromosome in scirtothrips dorsalis cryptic species sa <dig>  specific primers spanning putative nad6/nad <dig> and nad6/rrnl gene boundaries fail to amplify . internal primers amplify a portion of nad <dig>  while the reverse compliment of these primers  completes the 921 bp nad <dig> chromosome. non-numbered lanes are negative controls for each pcr

both the order and the coding strand of protein coding and ribosomal rna genes are identical to the other three thrips species with complete mitochondrial genomes available: thrips imaginis , frankliniella occidentalis  and frankliniella intonsa . translocations and inversions between s. dorsalis and the other thrips species are relegated to trna genes and much of this activity either precedes or follows cob . the sa <dig> genome has trnf coded on the minority strand  while the ea <dig> genome has trny coded on the minority strand. aside from these two inversions, the order and strand location of all genes is the same . in addition, the ea <dig> and sa <dig> genomes contain long  non-coding regions with no homolog in the other species . these lack the requisite features of control regions such as the t-stretch and a + t-rich segments. they also occur in different locations of the two genomes, between trnr and trng in ea <dig> and between nad <dig> and trnh in chromosome  <dig> of sa <dig> . the two genomes differ by  <dig>  % across all  <dig> homologs  and by  <dig>  % across the  <dig> protein coding genes.fig.  <dig> rates of various evolutionary events inferred from five linearized complete thrips mitochondrial genomes . a inversions and a fragmentation event are present among members of a single cryptic species complex. c translocations are more common among morphologically different members of a genera, and b increasingly common among different genera



there were  <dig> changes between the ngs contig containing the sa <dig> nad <dig> gene to the completed sa <dig> chromosome  <dig> validated by capillary sequencing. this corresponds to an error rate in ngs of about  <dig>  %. seven of these changes occurred within the first or last  <dig> nucleotides of the ngs contig, eleven occurred in a or t stretches ≥8 nt, while three changes did not meet either of these criteria.

discussion
the complete mitochondrial genomes were sequenced from two members of the s. dorsalis species complex using next-generation dna sequencing and validated using capillary sequencing. we found that the two genomes are highly divergent facilitating easy discrimination. levels of divergence were comparable to other crop pest cryptic species complexes  <cit>  and 5– <dig> fold higher than among cryptic species of mosquitoes  <cit> . moreover, an important discovery emerged when comparing the two genomes. one species has the single circular mitochondrial chromosome common to animals while the other has a fragmented genome consisting of one large chromosome and one small chromosome. the event giving rise to this architecture probably occurred quite recently based on high similarity among paralogs and the very small size of sa <dig> chromosome  <dig>  the complete control region and trns <dig>  appear to have been duplicated either preceding or during this fragmentation event. these paralogs show little divergence among chromosomes . in the case of the human body louse, paralogous control regions exhibited higher divergences ranging from  <dig> to 23 %  <cit>  suggesting this species has been multipartite for a longer period of time than has the sa <dig> cryptic species of scirtothrips dorsalis.

several additional putative trna genes were found however none appear to have homologs in the other cryptic species as such are either pseudogenes or were misidentified by the search algorithm. arwen is known to be a highly sensitive search algorithm with a corresponding high false positive rate  <cit> . given that the two trns <dig> paralogs within the sa <dig> genome are identical, they should both be functional though the duplicated trns <dig> on sa <dig> chromosome  <dig> is redundant.

methodologically, the bipartite nature of the mitochondrial genome of the south asia  <dig> cryptic species was confirmed using a pcr experiment whereby the null hypothesis of a single chromosome was rejected and the alternative hypothesis of a separate mini-circle chromosome containing nad <dig> was accepted . the absence of nad <dig> from the large chromosome of this species was also confirmed by sequencing the entire region between nad <dig> and rrnl where nad <dig> normally occurs in thrips . this provided additional evidence that nad <dig> is not present in this intervening region on the large sa <dig> chromosome, is not duplicated in the genome and is non-redundant. furthermore, given the apparent variation in pcr product brightness seen in fig.  <dig>  we sought to eliminate the possibility that reduced efficiency primer pairs might have overlooked coexistence among unipartite and bipartite genomes in sa <dig>  the apparently higher efficiency primers  were also used in the failed pcr reactions . to confirm this result, three additional pcr experiments were performed for each putative gene boundary which would be found in a coexistence scenario using different primers . all these experiments failed to yield a product increasing our confidence in the interpretation of an exclusively bipartite genome in sa <dig>   <dig>  % of the complete genome of the sa  <dig> cryptic species has been sanger validated and both chromosomes have been successfully circularized. in the ea  <dig> cryptic species, the single chromosome genome was successfully circularized using only next-generation sequencing data and, in addition, has been ~75 % sanger validated.

with the exception of the fragmentation event giving rise to sa <dig> chromosome  <dig>  all gene boundaries are shared among cryptic species within the s. dorsalis complex, with two trna inversions . in addition, the location of protein coding and ribosomal rna genes is constant among all five complete thrips mitochondrial genomes  with all differences accounted for by trna gene translocations or inversions . given that five complete thrips mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced representing both transgeneric, congeneric, and cryptic species pairwise comparisons, some initial predictions can be made about the relative rates of different types of evolutionary events in animals with highly rearranged mitochondrial genomes. first, trna gene inversions may be the most common event given they have occurred among lineages representing members of the same cryptic species complex . second, trna gene translocations have occurred more frequently in the lineages leading to morphologically distinguishable congeners and even more frequently among lineages representing different genera . shifts to a multipartite architecture within a genus may also be common , but testing this will require discovery of additional examples. all five complete thrips mitochondrial genomes share a block of  <dig> genes  where all gene boundaries are shared . the five genomes represent three genera, all in the pestiferous subfamily thripinae. additional complete genomes are needed from thrips in different subfamilies and suborders to make better inferences about these patterns and their phylogenetic significance across thysanoptera.

at 921 bp, sa <dig> chromosome  <dig> is the smallest mitochondrial chromosome documented in insects. it is about 1/ <dig> the size of the smallest mini-circle chromosome in the human body louse  <cit>  and about 45 % the size of the smallest mini-circle chromosome in the louse damalinia  <cit> . scirtothrips dorsalis lacks multiple control regions found in other thrips with the exception of the paralog in sa <dig> chromosome  <dig> . the small size of the sa <dig> mini-circle chromosome is likely a consequence of its recent evolution and selection may be for more expansive control regions and concomitant increased size of mini-circle chromosomes with the progression of time as in lice  <cit> .

thrips in the genus frankliniella have multiple control regions in their mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . in contrast, ea <dig> and sa <dig> chromosome  <dig> contain relatively large non-coding regions with no obvious control region motifs and no obvious homology among cryptic species. these two sequences also occur in widely separated parts of their respective chromosomes . while multiple control regions are not present in individual mitochondrial chromosomes for s. dorsalis cryptic species, their presence in frankliniella raises a possible connection between multiple control regions and a fragmented architecture. for example, if multi-partism can be reversed, it might lead to multiple control regions in a single chromosome. alternatively, duplicated control regions in a single mitochondrial chromosome may precede and help facilitate the evolution of multi-partism.

the discovery of a mini-circle chromosome in thysanoptera was assisted by large scale genomic data from next-generation sequencing. interestingly, large-scale genomic data was also needed to discover the fragmented mitochondrial genome architecture in the human body louse  <cit> . this indicates an important role for ngs platforms in mitochondrial evolution research. for this type of study,  <dig>  % should be considered a high estimate for the true error rate between ngs and capillary sequencing. this estimated error rate is likely exaggerated by 1) the small chromosome size used for calculation, 2) the at rich nature of these data and 3) higher error rates at the ends of contigs due to mis-assignment of raw reads. the issue of small chromosome size is peculiar to this study while the issue of uncertain lengths of poly a’s and poly t’s is a known source of error in ion torrent data and this type of error is likely to be elevated in at rich taxa. in addition, an elevated error rate at the ends of contigs has been documented in other ngs studies  <cit>  and is probably a function of the trade-off between contig length and quality during assembly of ngs raw reads. if error due to poly a or t stretches and the ends of contigs are ignored, the error rate for the sa <dig> mini-circle chromosome between ngs and sanger sequencing is reduced from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. despite these challenges, ngs provides a powerful tool for de novo mitochondrial genome construction. in hindsight, our inability to complete the expected single mitochondrial chromosome for the sa <dig> cryptic species of s. dorsalis using ngs data was the first indication that the genome could be fragmented.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of a bipartite mitochondrial genome architecture in the insect order thysanoptera and the latest development in the study of multipartite mitochondrial genomes in bilateria, an emerging area of inquiry with high potential to revolutionize our overall understanding of mitochondrial genome evolution. among insects, this phenomenon has only been found in the three minor paraneopteran orders, phthiraptera, psocoptera, and thysanoptera. the phenomenon has not yet been reported in the major paraneopteran order, hemiptera, despite  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the three orders with multipartite members also show the highest degree of genome rearrangement  <cit>  suggesting the two phenomena may be correlated. all three minor orders should be considered as animal models for rapid mitochondrial genome evolution, including genome fragmentation. we believe that continued development of these models will ultimately facilitate high resolution in vitro testing of mitochondrial recombination e.g.  <cit>  and a greater understanding of mitochondrial evolution across eukaryotes.
