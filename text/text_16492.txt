BACKGROUND
the morphological diversity of the living world, including the variation in size and shape, is generally assumed to be adaptive and shaped by natural selection. however, numerous internal factors, such as shared developmental systems inherited from common ancestors as well as structural and functional constraints, can restrict the response to selection  <cit> . an independently derived phylogeny is required to disentangle the effects of these influences on morphological evolution  <cit> . although numerous studies have investigated morphological evolution in a phylogenetic context in various groups  <cit> , this approach is still relatively rare in the studies of morphological variation in parasitoid wasps, even though they represent a very interesting biological model. parasitoids are hyperdiverse  and they possess complex life cycles and morphologies shaped by intimate host-parasitoid interactions. the frequent occurrence of both sexual and asexual reproduction poses a particular challenge because asexual lineages can freeze and amplify particular portions of morphological variation.

we addressed these issues in aphid parasitoids belonging to the genus lysiphlebus foerster . they are solitary koinobiont parasitoids, meaning that a single parasitoid larva develops per aphid host and allows the host to continue its growth and development while feeding upon it. lysiphlebus exploits over a hundred species of mostly small aphids, including many important pests   <cit> .

two species groups are recognised within the genus lysiphlebus based on wing morphology  <cit>  and molecular evidence  <cit> : the “fabarum” group and the “testaceipes” group. taxa with sexual and asexual reproduction are present within both species groups, and they show some divergence in early life history traits and morphological traits  <cit> , including wing shape  <cit> . for example, the species lysiphlebus hirticornis mackauer and l. melandriicola starý , as well as l. testaceipes  , such as most hymenoptera, reproduce by arrhenotoky   <cit> , in which fertilised eggs develop as females and unfertilised eggs develop as haploid males. by contrast, a recently described species of the “testaceipes” group, l. orientalis starý & rakhshani, reproduces exclusively by thelytoky   <cit> , that is by producing diploid females without fertilisation. lysiphlebus balcanicus starý, an endemic species of southeastern europe also belonging to the “testaceipes” group, appears to be thelytokous as well, because only female specimens were encountered in samples collected over a long period of time  <cit> . within the “fabarum” species group, three of the described species, namely l. fabarum , l. cardui  and l. confusus , occur in both sexual  and asexual  populations  <cit> . these three species were described based on morphological differences in the length and orientation of setae on the hind legs and on the distal margin of the wings, by which they are clearly distinguishable  <cit>  . however, different genetic studies showed no or little support for the species status of these three taxa  <cit> . we will therefore refer to them as the fabarum, confusus and cardui morphs  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the polygenic basis of wing shape and its adaptive significance , combined with the relative simplicity of a two-dimensional structure that allows a precise recording and analysis of the shape using geometric morphometrics, makes wing shape a very useful trait in the study of morphological evolution  <cit> . here, we explored the molecular variation  and morphological variation  to analyse possible factors, including reproductive mode, that are associated with the evolution of wing shape in aphid parasitoids from the genus lysiphlebus. specifically, we addressed the following questions: i) is genetic differentiation accompanied by parallel changes in the shape of the wing? ii) are parasitoid wasps assigned to different morphs and/or with different reproductive modes also divergent in their wing shape?

RESULTS
genetic diversity
all sequences of the amplified cytochrome oxidase subunit i gene  of lysiphlebus specimens were indel-free. the total alignment of 628-bp long mitochondrial sequences contained  <dig> variable sites, of which  <dig> were parsimony informative. the topologies of maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood  and neighbour-joining  trees were highly congruent. for this reason, only the ml tree is shown in figure  <dig>  although the bootstrap support obtained by all three methods of phylogenetic analyses is indicated in the figure.figure  <dig>

analyses of mitochondrial sequences supported the separation of the genus into the “fabarum”  and the “testaceipes”  species groups, with a mean genetic distance of  <dig> % between the groups.

within the “testaceipes” group, l. orientalis  and l. testaceipes  split as separate taxa, with a mean genetic distance of  <dig> %. l. testaceipes consisted of two distinct haplotypes with 1% genetic divergence, whereas four haplotypes were recorded in l. orientalis .

based on the coi gene analysis, the “fabarum” group was composed of  <dig> distinct haplotypes that are clustered into three well-supported phylogenetic lineages . overall, the mean genetic distance among specimens within the “fabarum” group was  <dig> %.

most of the haplotypes  were grouped into phylogenetic clade a. within this clade, the tree topology had poor statistical support, and the highest genetic distance between two haplotypes was  <dig> % . two haplotypes were found in both asexual and sexual parasitoids , two were found only in sexual parasitoids, and eight were found only in parasitoids with asexual reproduction .

associations of coi haplotypes with the three morphs of l. fabarum were inconsistent. most haplotypes were associated with one morph, but l. fabarum  <dig> was associated with the fabarum and cardui morphs, whereas the most common haplotype, l. fabarum  <dig>  was associated with the fabarum and confusus morphs, but also with l. melandriicola.

clade b was represented only with one haplotype, which is associated with all l. hirticornis specimens. lysiphlebus hirticornis is clearly separated from clade a with a mean genetic distance of  <dig> %.

all cardui morphs with sexual reproduction are grouped in phylogenetic clade c and separated from all other species/morphs. there is a genetic distance of  <dig> % between these morphs and the same morphs with an asexual mode of reproduction that are all grouped in clade a. this provides strong evidence that these sexual parasitoids represent a yet undescribed species. the phylogenetic trees showed that the closest relatives of sexual cardui morphs in our material are the specimens belonging to l. hirticornis .

the analysis of nuclear sequences  showed a well-supported split  between outgroups and lysiphlebus parasitoids, with a sequence divergence ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %.

all lysiphlebus specimens clustered into two groups corresponding to the “fabarum” group  and the “testaceipes” group  . the mean genetic divergence of the nuclear 28s d <dig> sequences between the “fabarum” and “testaceipes” species group was  <dig> %.

within the two species groups, the phylogenetic tree based on 28s d <dig> was poorly resolved due to insufficient sequence variation .

the principal component analysis  showed that clades a, b, and c clearly differ from clades d and e along the first principal axis, which describes almost 80% of the total variance in wing shape. the main shape changes that separate the abc  and de clades  are related to changes in the stigma, the length of the r <dig> vein  and the width of the wing’s distal part. compared to the “fabarum” group , “testaceipes” group parasitoids  have a wider distal part of the wing , a shorter r <dig> vein and a wider stigma.figure  <dig>

the permutation test against the null hypothesis of no phylogenetic signal revealed no evidence of a phylogenetic signal in wing size  but did reveal a significant phylogenetic signal in wing shape . the superimposition of the phylogenetic tree in the morphospace of the first two pc axes shows that concordance in divergence between genetic and morphological variation is due to the divergence between the two main clades .

separate pcas of wing shape variation within the “fabarum”  and “testaceipes”  groups reveal that the divergence in wing shape is largely associated with reproductive mode. within clade a, four subgroups can be distinguished a priori, based on the combination of morph  and reproductive mode: a <dig> – l. cardui/asexual, a <dig> – l. confusus/asexual, a <dig> – l. fabarum/asexual and a <dig> – l. fabarum/sexual). clades b  and c  are uniform with respect to these criteria.

in the morphospace defined by the first two principal components that describe over 45% of the total variation in wing shape, sexual and asexual lineages within the “fabarum” group clearly separate along the first axis . sexual lineages had longer and narrower forewings; particularly the apical part of the wing  is narrower in the sexual lineages compared with asexual lineages. the analysis of wing shape variation in the “testaceipes” group  showed that l. orientalis  and l. testaceipes  are clearly separated in the morphospace defined by the first two principal axes that describe almost 62% of total variance in wing shape. notably, the differences between the sexual and the asexual wasps parallel those observed in the “fabarum” group. the wings of the asexual species l. orientalis are characterised by a wider distal part and a shorter r <dig> vein in comparison with the sexual species l. testaceipes .figure  <dig>

pairwise comparisons within the “fabarum” group revealed that sexual l. fabarum  have significantly smaller wings than all three asexual groups within clade a. two sexual lineages, l. hirticornis  and l. cardui , have smaller wing size compared with all other groups except for sexual l. fabarum  and sexual l. cardui  . all groups based on morph and/or reproductive mode showed significant divergence in wing shape .table  <dig>

correct classification of individuals into the a priori groups was : a <dig> – asexual l. cardui 97% ; a <dig> – asexual l. confusus 100% ; a <dig> – asexual l. fabarum 100% ; a <dig> – sexual l. fabarum  <dig> ; b – sexual l. hirticornis  <dig> ; and c – sexual l. cardui  <dig> .

l. testaceipes  and l. orientalis  also differ clearly in wing size and wing shape . correct classification of individuals was d – l. testaceipes 100%  and e – l. orientalis 100% .

the shape changes between pairs of a priori groups are illustrated in figure  <dig>  as previously described, the sexual and asexual lineages diverge in the shape of the distal part of the wing , whereas different morphs often diverge in the shape of proximal area of the wing .

the multivariate regression of wing shape variables on log cs within the “fabarum” group was statistically significant :  <dig> % of the total variation in wing shape could be explained by allometry. within the “testaceipes” group, multivariate regression was not statistically significant . to explore whether the observed shape changes within the “fabarum” group are due to divergence in size between groups and related allometric shape changes, we performed pca on an allometry-free dataset . analysis of allometry-free shape variables revealed that the sexual and a sexual lineages differ in forewing shape regardless to differences in wing size between lineages .figure  <dig>

discussion
by analysing the sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial genes we confirmed the existence of two previously acknowledged species groups  within the genus lysiphlebus  <cit> . in terms of taxonomic characterisation, the barcoding region of the coi gene has proven to be a suitable marker for species identification within the genus lysiphlebus  <cit> , whereas the more conservative nuclear 28s d <dig> gene appears to be informative only at the generic or species group level. an unexpected discovery was a distinct group of coi haplotypes  that comprised all cardui morphs  with a sexual mode of reproduction. it represents a yet undescribed species that deserves further taxonomic treatment.

marked divergence in wing shape was found between the “testaceipes” and “fabarum” species groups. however, within these groups, especially within the “fabarum” group, there is no clear correspondence between the variation in wing shape and genetic divergence. additionally, we did not find any concordance between wing shape and the three described morphs in l. fabarum.

a significant finding in our study is that reproductive mode  is associated with wing shape. similar shape changes between the taxa with asexual and sexual modes of reproduction were recorded in the “testaceipes” as well as in the “fabarum” group. the relationship between wing shape and reproductive mode is particularly notable in the “fabarum” species group, in which most of the morphological variation could be related to the differences between the sexual and asexual taxa and morphs.

taxa with sexual reproduction had smaller wings than the taxa with asexual reproduction, and there were significant, size-related allometric changes in the shape of the wing. however, divergence in the wing shape was not solely the result of allometry, because the sexual and asexual lineages differed in wing shape even when the size effect was removed .

sexual reproduction  is the ancestral and dominant mode of reproduction in hymenoptera. asexual reproduction  is less frequent and often induced by heritable endosymbiotic bacteria  <cit> , but apparently not in lysiphlebus. sandrock and vorburger  <cit>  showed that asexual reproduction in l. fabarum is genetically determined and inherited as a single-locus recessive trait. asexual reproduction has the potential to spread in parasitoid populations because, very rarely, asexual  females produce fertile haploid males that may carry the thelytoky-inducing allele into sexual populations, a process referred to as ‘contagious parthenogenesis’  <cit> . there are currently no data about the underlying processes of asexual reproduction in l. orientalis, but the simplest assumption would be that they are similar to those in l. fabarum, considering that thelytoky is otherwise very rare in the aphidiinae and that rare males are also observed in natural and laboratory populations of l. orientalis  <cit> . in this study, the association of mitochondrial haplotypes with the mode of reproduction in the “fabarum” group was inconsistent, and two haplotypes were shared between the asexual and sexual wasps. these results are in concordance with the statement that the “fabarum” group is an evolutionary young sexual-asexual complex with incomplete genetic isolation between the reproductive modes  <cit> .

the mechanistic basis of the relationship between wing shape and reproductive mode is currently unknown. there is a lack of information on the genetic basis of wing morphogenesis in parasitic wasps, but studies on drosophila melanogaster show that numerous genes of small effect determine wing shape in flies  <cit> . presuming that parasitoid and fly wing morphogenesis is not dramatically different, and considering that reproductive mode in l. fabarum is inherited as a single-locus trait  <cit> , pleiotropy or co-inherence of the thelytoky-inducing allele and alleles affecting wing shape in the same linkage group may explain the observed link between reproductive mode and wing shape. this remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
deep genetic divergence of aphid parasitoids from the genus lysiphlebus  is accompanied by changes in wing shape. at a shorter timescale within the two species groups, there is no clear correspondence between morphological evolution and genetic divergence. however, we observed a clear association between reproductive mode and wing shape; in both species groups, similar differences exist between sexual and asexual wasps, explaining much of the variation in wing shape. further studies are necessary to resolve the mechanisms underlying the apparent relationship between reproductive mode and wing shape in lysiphlebus wasps.
