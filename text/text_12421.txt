BACKGROUND
many genes have been implicated in syndromal and/or non-syndromal cleft lip with or without palate . the majority of these candidate genes show expression in the facial ectoderm, including msx <dig>  bmp <dig>  pvrl <dig>  mid <dig> and p <dig>  although some  also have key roles in the mesenchyme  <cit> . in addition to coordinating mesenchymal outgrowth, the facial ectoderm also plays a number of other pivotal roles in facial morphogenesis, including facilitating the initial contact of the converging processes and the subsequent elimination of the epithelial seam in a manner that is likely analogous to that which occurs during formation of the more studied secondary palate. recently, mutations in the irf <dig>  gene were shown to cause the allelic disorders, van der woude and popliteal pterygium syndromes, both of which have cl/p as a major clinical feature  <cit> . significantly, common polymorphisms in irf <dig> have also been found to account for up to 12% of the contribution to the high incidence of non-syndromal cl/p, highlighting it as one of the most significant cl/p loci identified to date  <cit> . although the exact physiological function of this gene is not known, preliminary findings in mice found that irf <dig> is expressed in the medial edge epithelia of the fusing secondary palatal shelves, tooth buds, hair follicles and skin  <cit> . surprisingly, however, the expression of irf <dig> has not been reported during development and closure of the primary palate, an event which is distinct both in terms of embryological timing and underlying genetics from that of the secondary palate.

several secreted factors emanating from the facial ectoderm, including fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  and bone morphogenic protein  <dig>  induce mesenchymal expression of genes such as msx <dig> and msx <dig>  that promote mesenchymal cell proliferation and prominence outgrowth  <cit> . evidence suggests that the mesenchymal lim-homeodomain  encoding gene, lhx <dig> , is similarly under the control of ectodermal-derived signals, namely fgf <dig>  <cit> . in the mouse, lhx <dig> and its close homologue, lhx <dig>  were reported to be expressed only in the maxillary and rostral mandibular processes, palatal shelves and basal forebrain  <cit> . in lhx7-knockout mice, an isolated secondary palatal cleft was the only reported feature: the secondary palatal shelves formed and elevated normally but failed to properly contact and fuse  <cit> . of note however, is that most inbred mouse strains rarely display lateral facial clefts analogous to cl/p in humans. this is probably due in part to the altered growth rates that give rise to the elongated facial morphology although differences in sensitivity to gene dosage or redundancies between related genes may also play a role  <cit> . consistent with this, mutations in msx <dig> in humans are associated with clefts of the primary palate whereas knockout of both msx <dig> and msx <dig> are required to produce a primary palate cleft in mice  <cit> . in contrast, the chick in some ways provides a more suitable model system for studies on primary palatal clefting as this species, like humans, shows greater susceptibility to this anomaly. here, we have isolated chick cdnas orthologous to human irf <dig>  lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> and investigated their profile of expression during morphogenesis of the midface with an emphasis on the period around formation of the primary palate.

RESULTS
sequence conservation of lhx <dig>  lhx <dig> and irf <dig> between chick, mouse and human
clhx7: chest766i <dig> was shown to encode a protein with 89% and 95% identity to mouse and human lhx7/lhx <dig>  respectively . clhx6: chest365j <dig> represented a partial sequence  encoding two lim domains and the 5' end of a hd which displayed 94% identity  to both human and mouse lhx6/lhx <dig> . cirf6: chest58f <dig> represented a partial sequence of  <dig> bp that encoded the c-terminal two thirds  with 83% identity  to human and mouse irf6/irf <dig> .

expression of clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> in the facial primordia
clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> expression was initially detected by whole-mount in situ hybridization at hamburger-hamilton stage  <dig> and remained detectable up to hh <dig> . strong expression was found ventrally along the length of the maxillary primordia and the rostral portion of the mandibular primordia. maxillary expression remained high post-fusion with the medial nasal process . in the mandibular primordia, clhx <dig> expression remained strong whereas clhx <dig> appeared to gradually diminish from stage hh <dig>  of note, expression of both clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> was also detected in mesenchyme immediately underlying the pre-fusion epithelia of the globular projections of the medial nasal process from hh <dig> . clhx <dig> expression was far more pronounced than clhx <dig> in this region and remained detectable in the mesenchymal bridge of the beak up to hh <dig>  albeit at a much lower level . vibratome sections of these embryos revealed that expression of clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> was restricted to ectomesenchyme directly subjacent to the facial ectoderm . this expression profile resembles in part that of the wnt inhibitor, dkk <dig>  <cit>  and is consistent with the evidence indicating lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> are under the regulation of signals emanating from the ectoderm  <cit> . expression of both genes was also detected later in the palatal shelf mesenchyme at hh <dig> , with clhx <dig> uniquely displaying strong expression on the anterior tips of the developing shelves. expression of both clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> was also detected in the basal forebrain  and the otic vesicle from hh <dig> to hh <dig> .

expression of cirf <dig> in hh20- <dig> embryos
cirf <dig> expression was detected by whole-mount in- situ hybridization throughout the ectoderm of the craniofacial structures of hh20- <dig> embryos . vibratome sections of whole-mount embryos revealed irf <dig> levels generally very low but were elevated in the epithelia covering the frontonasal process, the maxillary primordia, and the nasal pits . expression in the leading edges of the medial nasal process, which ultimately fuse with the maxillary primordia during formation of the primary palate, disappeared with the elimination of epithelia and formation of the mesenchymal bridge. cirf <dig> expression was also detected in the ectoderm of the leading edges of the developing palatal shelves as well as in the ridges of the primitive oral cavity at hh <dig> . high cirf <dig> expression was also detected in the apical ectodermal ridge of the limb buds . notably, expression was also very high in the egg tooth primordium from hh <dig> .

discussion
here we have isolated the chick orthologues of lhx <dig>  lhx <dig> and irf <dig> and shown a high degree of sequence conservation with their mouse and human counterparts, suggesting evolutionary conserved functions for these proteins. it should be noted that despite repeated attempts at amplification of mrna/cdna across the equivalents of exons  <dig> to  <dig> and analysis of available chick genomic sequence, clhx <dig> did not contain the equivalent of human and mouse exon  <dig>  as this exon does not encode a known functional domain and its absence maintains the reading frame, it is likely that clhx <dig> also encodes a functional lim-hd transcription factor. interestingly, compared to the mouse, chick and human lhx <dig> had an additional  <dig> bp in the last coding exon producing a c-terminus with an additional nine amino acids. the validity of the mouse lhx <dig> sequence over this region was confirmed by sequencing murine  genomic dna. that the additional  <dig> bp is also evident in rat lhx <dig> indicates this  <dig> bp deletion likely represents a recent evolutionary event that may be restricted to the murine lineage. the biological significance of this must await determination.

in order to determine whether the chick would provide an appropriate model with which to investigate the roles of lhx <dig>  lhx <dig> and irf <dig> in craniofacial development and cl/p, their respective expression patterns around the time of primary palate morphogenesis were determined. similarly to the mouse, clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> were expressed in ectomesenchyme of the maxillary and mandibular primordia  <cit>  although in contrast to the mouse, the mandibular expression of clhx <dig> was not prominent. differential expression of clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> in the mandibular primordia was also evident at the anterior tips of the palatal shelves suggesting thee two genes are under distinct regulatory control which is consistent with results from cre-mediated fgf8-knockout mice  <cit>  in which lhx <dig> but not lhx <dig> expression was lost.

of particular interest, our expression studies in the chick have identified unique lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> expression domains. we detected strong clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> expression in the mesenchyme immediately underlying the pre-fusion epithelia of the medial nasal process, from around hh <dig>  which remained in the mesenchymal bridge post fusion. this expression has not previously been reported for the mouse and importantly suggests a role for lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> in outgrowth/survival of the medial nasal process during formation of the primary palate. clhx <dig> and clhx <dig> expression was also detected in the otic vesicle  a site of expression also not been reported in mice or any other species and therefore may be unique to the chick.

the strong expression in maxillary and medial nasal mesenchyme subjacent to the pre- and post fusion ectoderm indicate that lhx <dig> and lhx <dig> would be good candidate genes for craniofacial anomalies, in particular cl/p despite the isolated secondary palate cleft in lhx <dig> knock-out mice. in this regard, hlhx <dig> localizes to chromosome 1p31- <dig>  and is found less than  <dig>  mb from marker d1s <dig> which showed the most significant linkage in one cohort of non-syndromal cl/p cases  <cit> . in fact, this same region produced the only positive lod score for an individual finnish family presenting with van der woude syndrome-like features  <cit> . these data and the results reported herein put forward a case for screening patients with non-syndromal cl/p or irf <dig> mutation negative van der woude syndrome for mutations in lhx <dig> 

irf <dig> is mutated in van der woude and popliteal pterygium syndromes  <cit>  and has recently been identified as one of the most significant non-syndromal cl/p loci to date  <cit> . this report is the first to describe irf <dig> expression in the facial primordia prior to and during morphogenesis of the primary palate and supports the notion of a primary ectodermal defect in patients harboring mutations in irf <dig>  in concordance with the later embryonic stages assessed in the mouse  <cit> , cirf <dig> was similarly detected in the leading edge ectoderm of the palatal shelves and the ridges of the primitive oral cavity in the chick. interestingly, we also detected some unique expression domains of irf <dig>  which may be specific to the chick. strong irf <dig> expression was detected in the egg tooth primordium indicating it as an excellent marker for this structure. like other genes that are expressed in the ectoderm of the developing face such as shh and bmp <dig>  <cit> , high irf <dig> expression was also detected in the apical ectodermal ridge of the limb buds, which is consistent with the presence of limb hypoplasia or agenesis of digits, syndactyly, as well as valgus or varus deformities of the feet seen in popliteal pterygium syndrome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented herein shows both highly conserved and unique temporal and spatial expression of lhx <dig>  lhx <dig> and irf <dig> in the chick, particularly in the facial primordia around the time of their fusion to form the primary palate. the manipulability, minimal cost and susceptibility of chicks to cl/p will enable more detailed investigations into the functions of these genes in midfacial development and their role in contributing to common orofacial clefts.
