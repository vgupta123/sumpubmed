BACKGROUND
epigenetic modifications are responsible for the initiation and maintenance of gene silencing. hypermethylation of a cpg island in a promoter region is the most well-established epigenetic alteration. aberrant promoter methylation causes transcriptional inactivation of many genes involved in tumor suppression, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and dna repair. modified dna methylation is found in various types of cancer during carcinogenesis  <cit> . dna methylation is mediated by dna methyltransferases , which catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to c
 <dig> of cytosine from s-adenosyl methionine  <cit> . dnmt <dig> maintains dna methylation and possesses de novo methyltransferase activity during dna replication, and dnmt3a and dnmt3b play an important role as de novo methyltransferases. dnmts interact with transcriptional repression factors and histone deacetylases  and thus directly causes transcription inactivation  <cit> . dnmt <dig> is recruited by replication foci via its interaction with the ubiquitin-like plant homeodomain and ring finger domain  <dig> . it was well known that uhrf <dig> is involved in de novo methylation of dnmt3a and dnmt3b and plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis through gene silencing mechanisms and co-operating with hdac <dig>  which activates the dnmts and recruited by methyl cpg binding proteins  <cit> . on the other hand, recent evidence demonstrates that human ten-eleven translocation  enzymes have catalytic activity capable to convert 5-methylcytosine  to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine , resulting in an initiation of dna demethylation  <cit> .

currently, targeting enzymes that modify dna methylation is considered an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. indeed, dnmt inhibition blocks the methylation of newly synthesized dna strands, resulting in the reversion of the methylation status and the reactivation of silenced genes, such as tumor suppressors  <cit> . several dnmt inhibitors, including 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine , zebularine, and -epigallocatechin-3-gallate , reduce dna methylation and re-express silenced genes. thus, they have been suggested as potential anticancer drugs in various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, but side effects such as dna mutagenesis and cytotoxicity are still a cause for concern .

hinokitiol  is a component of essential oils extracted from chymacyparis obtusa and has anti-infective, anti-oxidative effects, and anti-tumor activities. the anti-tumor activity of hinokitiol has been demonstrated in several types of cancer cells by inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis . however, the relevant molecular mechanisms of hinokitiol regarding anti-cancer effects are still unclear.

the goal of this study was to investigate a possible mechanism of hinokitiol on dna methylation in human colon cancer cell lines. our data demonstrated that hinokitiol decreased dnmt <dig> and uhrf <dig> expression and increased the level of tet <dig> in colon cancer cell line hct- <dig>  furthermore, hinokitiol altered the methylation status of  <dig> hypermethylated genes in colon cancer cells and significantly reactivated the mrna expression of o6-methylguanine dna methyltransferase , carbohydrate sulfotransferase  <dig> , and b-cell translocation gene  <dig> , which are involved in cell proliferation or biological oxidation .

RESULTS
hinokitiol inhibits colon cancer cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner
to gain insight into the anti-proliferation effects of hinokitiol in colon cancer cells, we treated hct- <dig> and sw <dig> cells with hinokitiol of different concentrations and times. using cell morphological observation, we found that the number of cells decreased with increasing concentrations of hinokitiol . to compare the effects of hinokitiol on the viability of colon cancer and normal colon cells, a mtt assay was performed. as shown in fig.  <dig>  hinokitiol affected the viability of hct- <dig> and sw <dig> cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. in contrast, the viability of normal colon cells was maintained at concentrations over 5 μm of hinokitiol. our data showed that hinokitiol had higher sensitivity in colon cancer cells than in normal colon cells .fig.  <dig> hinokitiol inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells. ccd18co, hct- <dig>  and sw <dig> cells were treated with hinokitiol at indicated concentrations for 72 h  and for periods . an equal volume of dmso was treated as a vehicle control. cell proliferation was measured through mtt assay. the results are representative of three different experiments and expressed as the mean ± sd and as percentage of control. ** indicates a significant difference at the level of <  <dig> . normal colon cell line: ccd18co; colon cancer cell lines: hct- <dig> and sw480




hinokitiol inhibits the expression of dnmt <dig> in hct- <dig> cells
the expression patterns of dnmt <dig> in normal colon cells and colon cancer cells were analyzed by rt-pcr and qrt-pcr. in fig. 2a and b, dnmt <dig> mrna is highly expressed in colon cancer cells, especially in hct- <dig> cells, while only slightly expressed in ccd18co cells. to gain insight into the role of hinokitiol on dna methylation, we measured dnmt <dig> expression after the hinokitiol treatment. hct- <dig> cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of hinokitiol for up to 72 hrs, and their dnmt <dig> expression was analyzed every 24 h using qrt-pcr. we found that hinokitiol reduced dnmt <dig> mrna expression in time- and dose-dependent manners  . in addition, the effect of hinokitiol on the expression of dnmt <dig> protein was confirmed using western blotting. as shown in fig. 2e, hinokitiol  treatment decreased the protein level of dnmt <dig> in a time-dependent manner. furthermore, the expression levels of dnmt <dig> mrna and protein with 10 μm of hinokitiol for 72 h were similar to that of the 5-aza-dc treatment. we also showed the decreased expression of dnmt <dig> protein in sw <dig> cells treated with hinokitiol for 72 h . these results suggest that hinokitiol may be a promising agent for dnmt <dig> inhibition in colon cancer cells.fig.  <dig> hinokitiol decreases dnmt <dig> mrna and protein expression in hct- <dig> cells. the level of dnmt <dig> mrna was determined in hct- <dig> and sw <dig> cells using rt-pcr  and quantitative real-time pcr  . pcr products were gel-run in 2% agarose and visualized in ultraviolet . β-actin was used as a quantitative control. the quantitative dnmt <dig> mrna level was measured using qrt-pcr after hinokitiol treatment at indicated concentrations and times in hct- <dig> cells . total protein was isolated from cells treated with indicated concentrations of hinokitiol for  <dig> h and western blotting was performed to detect dnmt <dig> expression . the results were representative of three independent experiments. cells treated with dmso and 5-aza-dc were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. the β-actin was used as a loading control. * indicates a significant difference at the level of <  <dig> . m,  <dig> bp dna ladder




hinokitiol inhibits the expression of uhrf <dig> in hct- <dig> cells
uhrf <dig> forms a complex with dnmt <dig> to maintain dna methylation. in order to investigate the involvement of hinokitiol on uhrf <dig>  the level of uhrf <dig> protein was measured in nuclear extracts of hct- <dig> cells. like in fig. 2e, hinokitiol decreased level of dnmt <dig> protein . in addition, the level of uhrf <dig> protein was reduced in hct- <dig> cells exposed to  <dig> and 10 μm of hinokitiol, whereas the control cells were not . furthermore, knock-down dnmt <dig> expression by sirna reduced uhrf <dig> protein level . these results suggest that hinokitiol may be associated with dna demethylation pathways in hct- <dig> cells.fig.  <dig> hinokitiol decreases uhrf <dig> protein expression in hct- <dig> cells. hct- <dig> cells were treated with indicated concentrations of hinokitiol for 72 h. nuclear protein was extracted from the cells for western blot analysis with indicated antibodies . lamin b was used for loading control. hct- <dig> cells were seeded into culture plates. after 24 h cultivation, cells were transiently transfected with sirna dnmt <dig> and sirna control for  <dig>   <dig>  72 h, collected, and total protein was extracted for western blot analysis using indicated antibodies . experiments were done twice and representative blots were shown. the expression level of each protein was quantified with the image studio lite program, using lamin b as a loading control. the histogram shows the quantification expressed as ratio of the intensity of target gene/lamin b. * indicates a significant difference at the level of <  <dig> 




hinokitiol enhances tet <dig> activity in hct- <dig> cells
to confirm the effect of hinoikitiol on dna demethylation, tet <dig> protein expression in nuclear fraction of cells was evaluated by western blotting. hinokitiol increased tet <dig> protein expression in a dose-dependent manner and its level was higher than that of 5-aza-dc treatment . in addition, the alteration of 5hmc level by hinokitiol treatment was assessed by using elisa in hct- <dig> cells. pretreatment with 10 μm hinokitiol increased the 5hmc level of total dna about  <dig> -fold  compared to the control . tet <dig> activity was also analyzed by measuring the levels of 5mc and 5hmc using facs analysis. hinokitiol treatment induced a significant enhancement of 5hmc level  . the 5mc level was not affected in either treatment . these results indicate that hinokitiol may cause dna demethylation through the downregulation of dnmt <dig> as well as the upregulation of tet <dig> without reducing the level of 5mc in colon cancer cells.fig.  <dig> hinokitiol increases tet <dig> expression via enhancement of 5hmc level in hct- <dig> cells. hct- <dig> cells were treated with  <dig> and 10 μm of hinokitiol for 72 h and nuclear protein isolated from the cells was used to detect tet <dig> expression using western blot analysis . the expression level of each protein was quantified with the image studio lite program, using lamin b as a loading control. the histogram shows the quantification expressed as ratio of the intensity of target gene/lamin b. experiments were done twice and representative blots were shown. contents of 5hmc measured from cells treated with 10 μm of hinokitiol for 72 h using elisa-based methylflash hydroxymethylated dna quantification kit . the levels of 5mc and 5hmc were confirmed using flow cytometry analysis . all data are representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. the results were representative of three independent experiments. data are the means ± se of results from at least three independent experiments. * indicates a significant difference at the level of <  <dig> 




hinokitiol restores the mrna expression of mgmt, btg <dig>  and chst <dig> via demethylation
to verify the effect of demethylation and restoration of hinokitiol on silenced genes resulting from dna methylation, the levels of methylation and mrna of three cimp markers and seven candidate genes in colon cancer cells were analyzed by using qmsp and qrt-pcr, respectively. in our previous study, we observed that three cimp markers  and seven novel methylation candidate genes  were hypermethylated with the loss of the respective mrna expression in hct- <dig> cells but not in ccd18co cells  <cit> . here, the methylation status of these genes was reduced after treating the cells with 10 μm of hinokitiol for 72 h, though not completely reduced, and hinokitiol-reversed methylation levels of those genes were similar to that produced by a 5-aza-dc . moreover, hinokitiol significantly reactivated the mrna expression of mgmt, chst <dig>  and btg <dig>  .fig.  <dig> hinokitiol reduces methylation status and restores mrna expression of mgmt, chst <dig>  and btg <dig> genes. the effects of hinokitiol on the methylation status of hypermethylated genes in hct- <dig> cells compared with ccd18co, were assessed using qmsp. the ratio of methylation intensity was determined by the percentage of methylated reference . cells treated with dmso or 5-aza-dc at the same condition were used as negative and positive controls, respectively  the mrna expressions of mgmt, akr1b <dig>  chst <dig>  btg <dig>  and spg <dig> genes were measured using qrt-pcr . genomic dna and total rna were extracted from cells treated with 10 μm of hinokitiol for 72 h. data are the means ± se of results from at least three independent experiments. * indicates a significant difference at the level of <  <dig> 




discussion
the key findings of this study are that there were significant differences in sensitivity to hinokitiol between both colon cancer cells and normal colon cells. this result was similar to those of other reports showing that hinokitiol inhibits cell viability in colon cancer cells  but not in normal colon cells   <cit> . importantly, we demonstrated that hinokitiol decreased the protein expression of dnmt <dig> as well as uhrf <dig> in hct- <dig> cells, and its effect was similar with that of 5-aza-dc. hinokitiol is a natural tropolone-based monoterpenoid which is found in cupressacceous plants. it has been shown that hinokitiol possesses potent anti-tumor effects in various cancer cell lines, including colon cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and melanoma cells, by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis  <cit> . however, previous studies have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanism of hinokitiol-induced anticancer effects through apoptosis pathways, and the mechanisms underlying its effects are not yet fully understood. in the present study, our results demonstrated that hinokitiol has potential as a novel dnmt inhibitor and could be associated with dna methylation and thus provide hinokitiol as new therapeutic candidate of colon cancer.

epigenetic alterations, including dna methylation and histone modifications, play crucial roles in carcinogenesis and show possible targets for cancer treatment and prevention. dnmt <dig> is most abundantly found in mammalian cells. increased dnmt expression has been proposed as a mechanism for the increased methylation that occurs in the promoter region of tumors. in dna methylation, the role of dnmts is more complex and may involve changes in the expression of mrna or protein. previous studies have reported that dnmt <dig> inhibition correlates with reduction in tumorigenicity and increased expression of tumor suppressor genes, such as p16
ink4a or p14
arf  <cit> . thus, dnmt <dig> represents one of the most attractive targets for development of anticancer drugs. for example, azacytidine and decitabine are well known as dnmt inhibitors and the most successful epigenetic modulators. zebularine is another dnmt inhibitor with concomitant inhibitory activity towards cytidine deaminase. egcg has dual actions involving both dna demethylation and posttranslational histone modifications in cancer cells  <cit> . however, there are still restrictions because of their toxicity and poor stability or lack of information linked to the possible clinical applications.

in the present study, we determined that hinokitiol decreased uhrf <dig> proteins, which was similar or lower with those of 5-aza-dc in hct- <dig> cells and demonstrated that such uhrf <dig> inhibition was caused by dnmt <dig> reduced via transient transfection of sirna dnmt <dig>  it has been reported that increased uhrf <dig> is associated with cellular proliferation and has observed in various types of cancers such as colorectal cancer. in addition, uhrf <dig> binds to methylated promoters of many tumor suppressor genes by forming complexes with dnmts and hdac <dig>  resulting ultimately in the formation of cancer  <cit> . therefore, our results indicate that hinokitiol may directly regulate the expression of dna methylation-related genes and may inhibit cellular proliferation in colon cancer. we also measured the expression of hdac <dig> protein to investigate whether hinokitiol could affect histone deacetylation. incubation of cells to hinokitiol for 72 h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of hdac <dig> protein levels in the same cells, and its expression was lower than that of 5-aza-dc .

ten-eleven translocation  enzymes are have been identified as key players in demethylation of cytosine. tet family genes are frequently observed in human cancers  <cit> . our data demonstrated that hinokitiol increased the expression of tet <dig> protein well known as dna demethylation initiator in hct- <dig> and sw <dig> cells  but did not affect to the 5mc level. tet <dig> is an iron-dependent α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase enzyme, and both fully methylated and hemimethylated dna in a cg or non-cg context can serve as substrates for it. tet <dig> is responsible for converting 5mc to 5hmc methylcytosine because of causing demethylation. inactivation of tet <dig> is associated with aberrant dna methylation in cancers. tet <dig> methylation is connected with cpg island methylator phenotype  in colorectal cancer  <cit> . on the other hand, several studies reported that various chemical agents such as gsh, vitamin b <dig>  and vitamin e, appeared not to affect 5mc oxidation patterns despite dna demethylation effects via an increase of 5hmc level in cultured cells  <cit> . we also observed whether hinokitiol affects both tet <dig> and tet <dig> protein levels. our data showed that hinokitiol had little effect on the expression of tet <dig> protein in hct- <dig> and sw <dig> cells . on the other hand, tet <dig> protein expression did not detected in both cells . it might be because tet <dig> has a higher expression level in hematological cells than tet <dig> or tet <dig> and is recruited to genomic dna by distinct cxxc domain-independent mechanism unlike tet <dig> and tet <dig>  <cit> . therefore, our results suggest that hinokitiol may cause tet1-mediated dna modifications in colon cancer cells without 5mc reduction.

furthermore, our data demonstrates that hinokitiol alters the methylation status of hypermethylated genes in hct- <dig> cells. three cimp markers and seven new methylation candidates, which were reported in our previous study  <cit> , were selected randomly and assessed by using qmsp for this study. in this experiment, hinokitiol reduced methylation status of ten genes and induced the significant restoration of mgmt, chst <dig>  and btg <dig> mrna expression. mgmt is a dna repair enzyme involved in direct repair of alkylation damage products. chst <dig> is also known to inhibit the invasiveness of melanoma cells, and btg <dig> has anti-proliferative properties  <cit> . the evidence for promoter methylation patterns of those genes has been shown in various cancers, including colon cancer . further studies are required to clarify these relationships, particularly that hinokitiol induces effectively the reactivation of epigenetic-silencing genes in colon cancer cells through combination treatment with hdac inhibitors or chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5-fu and oxaliplatin.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated the relationship between hinokitiol and dna methylation in colon cancer cells and provided evidence for the potential of hinokitiol as a novel dnmt <dig> inhibitor for colon cancer treatment.
