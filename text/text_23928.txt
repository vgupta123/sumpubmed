BACKGROUND
cytokines and chemokines are soluble molecules playing key roles in the innate and adaptive immune responses. quantifying these immune mediators has become increasingly important to obtain better descriptions of immune responses during the course of disease or infections, or to a vaccine, therapy and intervention; such detailed descriptions allow the identification of correlates of cure or protection. various methods can be used to measure cytokines and chemokines, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  is still the most extensively employed  <cit> . this monoplex antibody-based immunoassay has been used for more than fifty years but can be laborious, sample consuming and expensive when studying profiles of large numbers of cytokines and chemokines. therefore, a number of new technologies allowing simultaneous quantitative measurements of multiple cytokines and chemokines in small sample volumes have recently been developed. these multiplex immunoassay systems can be divided into two classes: planar assays and suspension microsphere assays  <cit> . the multi-array meso scale discovery  electro-chemiluminescence detection system  and luminex xmap technology  are considered to be the two most suitable platforms for biomarker analysis or quantification .

the growing use of luminex technology has led to different kits being made available by several companies, and we decided to work with this multiplex platform. the luminex system allows the analysis of up to  <dig> analytes in a single well. relatively small volumes  of serum, plasma, other body fluids, or cell culture supernatant can be assayed for cytokines and chemokines. extensive data have been published validating the luminex platform for detection of multiple analytes, by comparing this technique with elisa . cross-comparisons between reagent suppliers showed variability in absolute cytokine concentration results in serum or plasma . moreover, a study comparing luminex kits from three different companies, including world health organization  cytokine standards in addition to the standards provided with each kit, revealed striking differences in results for cytokine concentrations in serum  <cit> .

there have been few studies comparing different luminex kits using supernatants from antigen-stimulated cell culture, an approach used in vaccine research. one study compared luminex kits from three different suppliers for the determination of cytokine levels in whole blood culture supernatant  <cit> , and two studies compared cytokine and chemokine levels in supernatants from antigen specific-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells  as tested with different commercial luminex kits  <cit> . these studies revealed differences of performance  between the suppliers tested. defawe and colleagues published a study on optimization and validation of a luminex protocol to assess cytokine and chemokine production by vaccine-specific cells to allow better characterization of immune responses  <cit> . however, the optimization of the “cell culture step” described in their work could be improved. the aim of the present study was to optimize a cell culture protocol  to obtain reproducible cytokine and chemokine quantifications by luminex technology in antigen-stimulated pbmc supernatants; the second aim was then to compare the performances of different luminex kits.

RESULTS
reproducibility of the luminex assay
we first performed an intra-laboratory reproducibility study with a multiplex assay developed and shared by the baylor institute for immunology research  and using polystyrene beads . pbmc from six human immunodeficiency virus -infected patients  were cultured without stimulation or with:  lipo- <dig> hiv- <dig> vaccine  <cit> ,  a mix of five long hiv- <dig> peptides ,  a 15-mers hiv- <dig> peptide pool and  staphylococcal enterotoxin b  as a positive control. three independent cultures were performed:  <dig> million pbmc/well were cultured in triplicate for  <dig> and 11 days, and assayed for ifnγ, perforin, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  in the 11 day-cultures , high concentrations and large variations were observed for all cytokines with seb and peptide stimulations . for example, lp mix induced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  pg/ml for ifnγ with pbmc from patient a and from  <dig> to  <dig>  pg/ml for perforin with pbmc from patient b. by contrast, a short stimulation period without re-stimulation could lead to more reproducible results . at day  <dig>  seb strongly stimulated the pbmc, and il- <dig>  measurement seemed to be the most variable . hiv-specific stimulation induced very low concentrations of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  but the lp mix resulted, in samples from patient a, in an ifnγ concentration from  <dig>  to  <dig>  pg/ml and a perforin concentration of  <dig>  to  <dig>  pg/ml. as expected, intraclass correlation coefficients  for hiv-stimulated samples for the 11-day stimulations were low  whereas good iccs  were observed with the 2-day cultures for ifnγ  and perforin . we excluded extrapolated concentration values, i.e., below or above the limits of quantification  and corresponding fluorescent intensity . nevertheless, even excluding extrapolated values, iccs were not in all cases acceptable. for il- <dig>  the agreement was too low .table  <dig> description of luminex kits

kinetics of cytokine production
we performed kinetic studies over 7 days with samples from two healthy donors to determine optimal culture duration for quantification of weakly secreted cytokines in stimulated-pbmc supernatants. first, we found that the culture duration  should not be longer than 6 days to maintain cell viability above 70 % using non-stimulated or tuberculin purified protein derivative -stimulated pbmc .

t cell subsets can be characterized according to their cytokine secretion profile. we focused on four cytokines: the t-helper  <dig> cytokines ifnγ and il- <dig>  the th <dig> cytokine il- <dig>  and the th <dig> cytokine il- <dig>  the optimal culture duration was defined as that giving the highest specific concentration . the specific concentration of il- <dig> was maximal after two days of stimulation whereas the specific concentration peaks for ifnγ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> were on day  <dig> . these findings suggested that different time points  are required for optimal quantifications of different cytokines in supernatants from antigen-stimulated pbmc.fig.  <dig> kinetics of cytokine production. milliplex kits from millipore  were used to perform kinetic experiments with pbmc from two healthy donors stimulated for  <dig>   <dig> or 5 days with ppd  and seb  as positive control. non-stimulated  pbmc were used as negative control. results obtained for samples from donor  <dig>  and donor  <dig>  are shown. ns and ppd values correspond to the left y axis and seb values to the right y axis




number of stimulated pbmc
the quantity of pbmc available in clinical trials and the numbers of specific cells are often small, so we compared the use of  <dig>  and  <dig>  million cells per well: pbmc from two healthy donors were stimulated with ppd and assayed for the same four cytokines at their optimal time point . the concentration of il- <dig> was slightly lower after the stimulation of  <dig>  million of pbmc per well than  <dig>  million of pbmc/well  without any difference in the background . the concentration of ifnγ was also slightly lower with  <dig>  million than  <dig>  million stimulated pbmcs , but a similar relative difference was observed for the background . there was no significant difference in il- <dig> concentrations between the two densities of pbmc. the concentration of il- <dig> following ppd stimulation was similar at the two densities of pbmc but the background was significantly lower at  <dig>  million pbmcs per well . thus, the stimulation of pbmc at  <dig>  and  <dig>  million per well resulted in relatively similar levels of specific cytokine secretion .fig.  <dig> optimization of cell concentration. milliplex kits from millipore  were used to perform cell concentration optimization experiments using  <dig>  or  <dig>  million non-stimulated  or ppd-stimulated pbmc from two healthy donors cultured in triplicate for  <dig> or 5 days. results obtained with samples from donor  <dig>  and donor  <dig>  are shown at the optimal time point defined for each cytokine. mean cytokine concentrations are represented by black lines




comparison of three commercial luminex kits
next, we compared luminex kits supplied by different manufacturers . we first analysed mean % cv from standard and samples coming from polystyrene bead based 10-plex and magnetic bead based 15-plex kits and found that they were lower with magnetic beads  compared to polystyrene ones , thus confirming the better precision of magnetic kits as previously described  <cit> . in the next experiments, only luminex kits using magnetic beads were selected and analytes were quantified at their optimal time point previously defined.

we first compared vendor-reported  working range  and upper limit of quantification ) and experimental working range for each kit. the working range was defined as that for which the observed concentration was between 70 % and 130 % of expected concentration using the five parameter log-logistic  standard curve. the  <dig> cytokines common to the three kits were studied and the results are summarized in table  <dig>  a sensitivity lower than that reported by the vendor was observed for some analytes for all kits. the lloq was particularly discordant with ozyme and bio-rad kits for gm-csf and especially with the bio-rad kit for il-12p <dig> . ozyme and bio-rad kits also showed a narrower standard spectrum than expected: the observed uloq diverged by one or two dilutions from the theoretical value for many cytokines. overall, we obtained a better working range with millipore than ozyme and bio-rad kits.table  <dig> working range and sensitivities

differences between theoretical and experimental limits of quantifications  expressed in pg/ml are highlighted with a, b, and c for 1-dilution, 2-dilution and 3-dilution differences from theoretical loq, respectively




we then used intra-assay coefficients of variation  to compare the precision of the three kits with standards and samples. all kits performed well for standard intra-assay precision: the mean of standard intra-plate cvs for the  <dig> common cytokines was below 8 % for all kits . as this work was initially performed to select the best luminex kit for a tb/hiv study, pbmc from two healthy donors, one hiv-1-positive patient and one tuberculosis -positive patient were cultured in triplicate for  <dig> and 5 days without antigen  or with ppd, early secreted antigenic target 6 kda protein  or seb. the supernatant of each culture well was considered to be one sample for luminex analysis. not all the cytokines were included in the final analysis because their values were above the uloq  or below the lloq . eleven common cytokines were thus analyzed: ip- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-1β and il- <dig> after 2-day culture and il- <dig>  gm-csf, ifnγ, il-17a, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnfα after 5-day culture. cvs of three culture replicates for these  <dig> cytokines were plotted against the mean concentration for ns, ppd, seb and esat- <dig> stimulations. a characteristic non-linear relationship was observed for all kits : the cv rose substantially as the mean value approached zero.

figure  <dig> shows %cvs obtained for each kit according to culture conditions — ns, ppd- and seb-stimulated pbmc — highlighting the generally accepted 25 % cutoff value for biomarker assay precision  <cit> . for seb stimulations, the overall mean pooled cv for all donors and all cytokines  was between  <dig> and 18 %. for ppd stimulations, the values were  <dig>  % for bio-rad,  <dig>  % for millipore and  <dig>  % for ozyme; only the il- <dig> cv was above the 25 % threshold with the bio-rad kit in contrast to millipore and ozyme kits which showed cv >25 % for il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il-17a. applying a 30 % cv threshold like the study by defawe and colleagues  <cit> , the millipore kit gave acceptable %cvs for il- <dig>  the mean pooled cv was even higher for ns samples:  <dig>  % for ozyme,  <dig>  % for bio-rad and  <dig>  % for millipore.fig.  <dig> intra-assay precision of samples. %cv of the concentrations  as determined with luminex magnetic kits from ozyme, millipore, and bio-rad for the  <dig> common analyzed cytokines. left panel: non-stimulated pbmc; middle panel: ppd-stimulated pbmc; right panel: seb-stimulated pbmc. mean cvs calculated for all donors and all cytokines are represented by red lines




next, we analyzed cytokine concentrations in the supernatant from tb-infected stimulated pbmc. the kits yielded different cytokine concentrations with quality control samples  from millipore and these experiments also revealed some cross-reactivities for the ozyme kit: it detected il- <dig> at a high concentration in the millipore qcs which do not contain this cytokine . although the kits gave results that were generally compatible, there were discrepancies between them for particular cytokines . another approach to measuring cytokine production is the use of a stimulation index , calculated as a ratio between mean antigen-stimulated pbmc concentration and mean non-stimulated pbmc concentration. like defawe and colleagues  <cit> , we used a si threshold of  <dig> for positivity and observed that the kits tested gave divergent results for il-1β . although no discrepancy between the kits for positive or negative si was observed for the other cytokines, some sis differed by  <dig> to  <dig> between kits. thus, our study showed variability in the measurement of cytokine production  in supernatants from antigen-stimulated pbmc with luminex kits coming from different manufacturers.fig.  <dig> cytokine profiles in tb-infected patient. cytokine production by ppd- and esat-6-stimulated pbmc from a tb-infected donor was measured with kits from millipore, ozyme and bio-rad. a specific cytokine concentrations . b stimulation index . the value for il- <dig> from non-stimulated pbmc given by the millipore kit was inferior to the range of the standard curve and was therefore imputed by the lowest extrapolated value for this cytokine . the il-17a concentration with esat- <dig> stimulation was a null value for all kits, so si could not be calculated. the positive threshold for the si was set at  <dig> 




internal qc for luminex study
for the last experiment, we used the millipore kit because: 1) its working range and sensitivity were better than the two other kits tested, 2) %cvs were as good as the other kits, 3) no cross-reactivity was observed, 4) it was the only kit with qcs provided, and 5) it contains most analytes that we were interested in.

a “home-made” internal control  was used in addition to the two millipore qcs  to evaluate intra- and inter-assay precision and thus to check the reproducibility of the assay. this internal control was used to determine variations observed for a control sample prepared and stored under the same conditions as our study samples. intra- and inter-assay %cvs for the internal control assayed in duplicate are reported in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively, for  <dig> of the  <dig> cytokines . low intra-assay variability was observed both with the internal control and millipore qcs. mean cvs for each cytokine were <13 % for the “home-made” internal control  and <7 % for millipore qcs . only two of the  <dig> calculated intra-assay cvs for the internal control were above the 25 % threshold. the inter-assay variability was also low. the cv was <18 % for each cytokine concentration in the internal control , and <14 % in the millipore qcs . thus, the millipore milliplex kits demonstrated a good precision and reproducibility in our hands.fig.  <dig> intra-assay variability of internal control. %cv concentration for each of the  <dig> plates calculated using internal control duplicates for the selected 15-plex millipore magnetic kit . mean %cvs are represented by red lines. il- <dig> and il-1β %cvs were not calculated due to concentration values < lloq and > uloq, respectively

discussion
the luminex platform is widely used to study immune responses but only few studies evaluated its reproducibility and/or compared kits from different suppliers using supernatants from stimulated pbmc . this work was designed to evaluate reproducibility of cytokine quantification by luminex assay in supernatants from antigen-stimulated pbmc and to improve this quantification by optimization of the culture protocol and eventually the choice a particular commercial kit. we used cryopreserved pbmc because such samples are typical of those used in clinical trials. moreover, it has been shown that using validated standard operating procedures  for isolation, cryopreservation and thawing of pbmc, cd4+ and cd8+ cells maintain full functionality in cytokine enzyme-linked immunospot  assays  <cit> . we first tested two different stimulation protocols: a two-round stimulation  in the presence of ril- <dig> supplemented medium, and a one-round stimulation for  <dig> to 7 days without ril- <dig> supplemented medium. the two-round stimulation protocol induced a lot of variability. however, this type of protocol could be valuable to investigate “on/off” signals if no precise quantification of secreted cytokines is required. we also observed some variability, although to a lesser extent, with the 48 h stimulation protocol. like elispot assay, the observed variability with the luminex assay, which is inherent to cell culture, probably resulted in part from variations in counting and pipetting, and low antigen-specific cell frequency  <cit> . one way to minimize this variability is to perform multi-well stimulations and to pool supernatants before assaying them by the luminex platform.

another factor to take into consideration for cytokine quantifications in stimulated-pbmc supernatants is the cell viability. defawe et al. claimed that a high cell viability limited the potential effect of dead cells on cytokine content measured by luminex  <cit> . however, we observed that having cell viability above 80 % on the day of stimulation  was not sufficient to ensure low cell mortality during the culture. indeed, a dose of 100 ng/ml seb  killed near 50 % of pbmc after 5 days of culture . consequently, the antigen dose needs to be adapted.

our results suggest that two different time-points are required for optimal quantifications of different cytokines  in supernatants from antigen-stimulated pbmc. this is consistent with published results. indeed, differences in the kinetics of ifnγ and il- <dig> production have already been observed in whole blood cell cultures  <cit> . the duration of in vitro stimulation of pbmc with recall antigens determines the subset distribution of ifnγ-producing cells, and  <dig> or 5 days of stimulation are necessary to have a predominance of ifnγ-secreting t cells  <cit> . lagrelius and colleagues reported that  <dig> and 7 days are the most suitable periods for stimulation to measure various cytokine levels in whole blood supernatant  <cit> . furthermore, our results validating the use of  <dig>  million pbmc per well are in agreement with those obtained by others with cytomegalovirus  stimulation  <cit> .

after setting up our protocol for cytokine measurements in supernatants coming from antigen-stimulated pbmc, we compared results obtained with luminex magnetic kits coming from three different manufacturers. we observed a lower sensitivity than that reported by the vendor for some analytes for all kits but overall, we obtained a better working range with millipore than ozyme and bio-rad kits. also, djoba siawaya and colleagues reported a comparison between commercial luminex cytokine kits using whole blood supernatant and concluded that the linco  kit was the most sensitive for measuring concentrations of numerous recombinant cytokines in samples that had been spiked with serial dilutions of the standards provided by the manufacturer  <cit> . consistent with our results, belabani and colleagues showed that a bio-rad magnetic luminex kit was not as sensitive as suggested by the manufacturer for some cytokines  <cit> . in their condensed performance-validation strategy for multiplex detection kits used in studies of human clinical samples recently published, these authors proposed a complete validation of luminex assays. among the critical points, we would also recommend 1) extending the standard curve to include lower values to check the working range and true sensitivity; 2) including lloqs and uloqs as validation samples to validate their concentration; 3) excluding values below the lloq or using specific statistical analyses that takes into account left-censoring  <cit> ; 4) diluting and reanalyzing all samples with a concentration above the uloq; and 5) fixing the thresholds of %cv and %recovery at 25 %  as acceptance criteria for samples, as defined by lee and colleagues  <cit> .

we then compared the precision of the three kits with standards and samples. it is important to note that we used here triplicate cultures in our luminex assays  to estimate the variability cytokine assays results, and this could explain at least in part the high variability observed. as observed for elispot  <cit> , but also tetramer assays and cytokine flow cytometry  <cit> , the relationship between cv and mean response level is not linear. the stability of the cv is poor at very low mean values, and antigen-specific assays are often used to analyze data in a range where cv is non-linear. consequently, maecker and colleagues suggested using standard deviation , which may be related linearly to the response mean, to compare the precision of different assays  <cit> . however, we did not find a clear linear correlation between sd and mean concentration , and therefore we used %cv to compare precision of the different kits. our results confirmed that the lower the secretion, the higher the %cv and that il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il-17a were difficult to quantify accurately even at the optimal time point, whatever the kit used. another group has compared luminex kits for the measurement of cytokines in supernatants collected from antigen-stimulated pbmc: they report good intra-plate but poor inter-plate precision of the bio-rad 17-plex kit  <cit>  and found that the millipore magnetic kit gave the most reproducible results  <cit> . in our hands, the good precision of millipore kits was confirmed, as mean % cv of standards and samples from  <dig> different kits  were similar.

we also used a “home-made” internal control to evaluate precision and reproducibility of milliplex kits as suggested by de jager and colleagues in their work with serum, plasma and whole blood culture supernatant to define the prerequisites for cytokine measurements in clinical trials with multiplex immunoassays  <cit> . we showed that the millipore milliplex kits demonstrated a good precision and reproducibility in our hands. similarly, in their study of optimization and qualification of a multiplex bead array to assess cytokine and chemokine production by vaccine-specific cells, defawe and colleagues found cvs for the intra-assay and inter-day variability below 30 % for all but one analyte with a millipore kit  <cit> .

our study showed variability in the measurement of absolute cytokine concentration in supernatants from antigen-stimulated pbmc with luminex kits coming from different manufacturers. a previous study showing that a bio-rad kit was more sensitive than an invitrogen kit revealed the potential for differences in absolute cytokine concentration reported by these two kits  <cit> . other studies also showed variability in the measurement of absolute cytokine concentrations in serum or plasma . possibly, the different capture and detection antibodies are the major causes of the differences in performance of multiplex kits from different manufacturers as well as the heterogeneity in analytes within each kit. also, differences between the purified recombinant proteins used to generate the standard curves, and between assay buffers supplied by the manufacturers are likely to contribute to the divergent results, as well as cross-reactivities observed with the ozyme kit. thus, the main criterion to select a manufacturer should be the availability of the panel of analytes that needs to be quantified and mixing data coming from different kits for analyses should be banned.

to determine positivity of samples, defawe and colleagues used an empirical method based on their experience using the assay and they aimed to control the false positive rate below 3 %  <cit> . the first criterion was “minimum analyte concentration over background” determined for each analyte and the second criterion was “minimum fold increase over background concentration”. the minimum fold increase over background concentration criterion was set as three-fold for all analytes. we used the same second criterion in this study to calculate the si, but the definition used for the first criterion is debatable because there is no consensus formula to determine the minimum analyte concentration over background.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we demonstrate that a protocol with a single round of stimulation but with two time points  gave the optimal quantifications for different cytokines using  <dig>  million pbmc per well, a cell quantity that gave the same level of specific cytokine secretion as  <dig>  million. millipore kits appear to be slightly more sensitive than those from bio-rad and ozyme. however, we conclude that the panel of analytes that need to be quantified should be the main determinant of kit selection and that the same kit must be used throughout any given study. we also think that it is important to use the same batch number throughout the study to allow results to be compared between plates. to ensure the validity of the results, we also recommend the use of an internal control. using this type of sample, we demonstrated that a 15-plex magnetic milliplex kit displayed good precision and reproducibility. moreover, our study suggests that particular attention should be paid to cell viability during cell culture to ensure that high cell mortality does not perturb the nature of cytokines secreted. finally, to limit the variability inherent to cell culture, we suggest the use of supernatant pooled from at least three culture replicates to avoid large variations in the cytokine concentrations observed. in view of the cost of the technique and the good reproducibility of the results obtained with millipore qc and with our internal control , it is unclear whether supernatant replicates are beneficial if standard curves are performed in duplicate and are extended to include lower levels so as to confirm the working range. in summary, our findings should help optimize assays for quantifying immune mediators during the course of disease or infection, or in response to vaccine or therapy.
