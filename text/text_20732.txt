BACKGROUND
light is the principal zeitgeber that entrains circadian rhythms of physiology and behaviour  <cit> . the major light input pathway to the suprachiasmatic nucleus  is the retinohypothalamic tract  <cit> , which arises from a population of retinal ganglion cells  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells, rods, and cones all convey photic information to the scn, and mice lacking these photoreceptive systems cannot be entrained by light  <cit> . excellent progress has been made in the understanding of circadian photic entrainment  <cit> . this includes light-induced transcriptional activation of core clock genes in the scn, such as per <dig> and per <dig>  as well as immediate-early gene c-fos. exposure to light pulses at night induces expression of these genes in the scn, and this light induction mechanism has been suggested as a critical pathway for the resetting of circadian clock in response to changes in light/dark conditions  <cit> . intercellular signalling mechanisms between scn neurons are also important in circadian photic entrainment, as mice with mutation in a neuropeptide receptor for vip  and pacap  are unable to sustain normal circadian behaviour and exhibit loss of sensitivity to light  <cit> .

in addition to the effect of light on circadian entrainment, light also has a direct effect on physiology and behaviour, generally termed as "masking"  <cit> . for instance, light pulses given at night acutely suppress the locomotor behaviour of nocturnal rodents  <cit> , and this can occur without functional clockwork  <cit> . masking may account for the maintenance under normal light/dark conditions of wheel-running rhythms in cryptochrome-deficient  mice, which are behaviourally arrhythmic under constant darkness. the contribution of masking to normal locomotor activity rhythms is unclear, as is the participation of the scn in masking effects of light. vitaterna et al  first observed a light-driven per <dig> rhythm in the scn in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice, and have suggested that the light-driven molecular rhythm in the scn may be related to the preservation of their locomotor rhythm  <cit> .

we previously found that prokineticin  <dig>  is a first order clock-controlled gene, whose expression in the scn is regulated by clock and bmal <dig> acting on the e-boxes in the gene's promoter  <cit> . we have also demonstrated that pk <dig> may function as a scn output molecule that transmits circadian locomotor rhythm via activation of a g protein-coupled receptor  <cit> . interestingly, we also observed that pk <dig> expression is rapidly induced by light pulses administered at night  <cit> , a characteristic that is usually seen with core clockwork genes but not clock-controlled genes. here we further investigated the light regulation of the rhythm of pk <dig> expression in the scn. in particular, we investigated the photoreceptive mechanisms responsible for the light-induced pk <dig> expression in the scn. utilizing cry1-/-cry2-/- mice, we also determined whether light can drive pk <dig> expression in the scn independent of a functional circadian clock.

RESULTS
pk <dig> responds differentially to the delay and advance of light/dark cycles
we first examined the effects of abrupt shifts of light/dark cycles on pk <dig> mrna rhythm in the scn. animals were first entrained for two weeks under  <dig> hour light:  <dig> hour dark , then subjected to either a  <dig> hour delay  shift or  <dig> hour advance  shift of light/dark cycles. we measured pk <dig> mrna in the scn of these animals to examine how quickly the pk <dig> mrna rhythm re-entrains to the shifted light/dark cycles. under ld, pk <dig> mrna peaks during the day and remains low or undetectable during the night. during the first cycle of the delayed shift , the pk <dig> mrna rhythm responds quickly: the rising phase of pk <dig> expression adjusts rapidly to the delayed light/dark cycles, while the falling phase still resembles that of the unshifted light/dark cycles . in contrast, the pk <dig> mrna rhythm responds very little to a  <dig> hour advance shift . during the first cycle of the advance shift, the pk <dig> oscillation pattern remains similar to that of the unshifted ld . these changes in pk <dig> expression during 6hrd or 6hra shift indicate that the endogenous circadian clock exerts dominant control over the pk <dig> rhythm, as pk <dig> expression cannot respond immediately and completely to the shifts of light/dark cycles.

as it normally takes about 1– <dig> days for locomotor rhythms to stably entrain to phase delays and about 5– <dig> days to entrain to phase advances  <cit> , we next examined the timecourse of shifts of the pk <dig> rhythm to  <dig> hour phase advances and delays. consistent with the animal's locomotor behaviour, the pk <dig> mrna rhythm reaches stable phase within  <dig> days of 6hrd shift . in contrast, only the rise of pk <dig> reaches stable phase within  <dig> days of 6hra shift, while the fall of pk <dig> takes longer . thus, we further examined whether the pk <dig> rhythm is stably entrained after  <dig> days of 6hra shift. as expected, the pk <dig> rhythm is completely entrained to 6hra shift after  <dig> days . together, the differential responses of pk <dig> rhythm to a 6hrd or 6hra shift indicate that the endogenous circadian clock predominantly controls pk <dig> rhythm, as circadian oscillators typically show rapid phase delays but advance with transients  <cit> . the entrainment patterns of pk <dig> during phase shifts are consistent with behavioural studies in animals and human subjects  <cit> .

pk <dig> rhythm is entrained by different photoperiods
we next examined the effect of photoperiod on the pk <dig> molecular rhythm in the scn. pk <dig> mrna was measured in the scn of mice entrained under different photoperiods:  <dig> hour light:  <dig> hour dark ,  <dig> hour light:  <dig> hour dark , or  <dig> hour light:  <dig> hour dark . during 12l:12d, pk <dig> mrna is highly expressed during the  <dig> hour light phase with peak level at zt <dig> . under 16l:8d, pk <dig> mrna expands to the entire  <dig> hour light phase and is essentially undetectable during the  <dig> hour dark period . however, the expression of pk <dig> mrna is not confined to the light phase of the shorter photoperiod , as pk <dig> mrna rises before lights on and persists after lights off . the temporal profile of pk <dig> mrna under this short photoperiod  is very similar to that observed under 12l:12d  or constant darkness   <cit> . thus, although light can induce pk <dig> mrna and expand the duration of pk <dig> expression, the phase angle of pk <dig> expression is determined by the circadian clock, and its duration cannot be further compressed under shorter photoperiods. interestingly, the peak of pk <dig> mrna expression was significantly higher in long days  than in shorter days  , further indicate the enhancing effect of light on pk <dig> expression. however, a significant reduction in the pk <dig> peak level is observed under a very long photoperiod  . we also noticed that under 20l:4d, pk <dig> mrna is further expanded and becomes detectable even in dark phase . under this long photoperiod , the difference between the peak and basal level of pk <dig> is only about  <dig> fold . as it has been reported that the rhythms of mper <dig> and mper <dig> mrnas in the scn are also entrained with different phase angles under a variety of photoperiods  <cit> , we have also examined per <dig> and per <dig> rhythm in our photoperiod studies . the per <dig> and per <dig> rhythm we observed under these photoperiods are consistent with previous findings  <cit> . taken together, these results indicate that changes in photoperiod alter pk <dig> rhythm in the scn, and the amplitudes of pk <dig> mrna oscillation are greatly reduced in very long photoperiods.

light inducibility of pk <dig> is eliminated in mice that lack melanopsin, rod and cone phototransduction system 
as melanopsin has been implicated in circadian photoreception  <cit> , we examined whether the pk <dig> molecular rhythm is normally entrained in melanopsin-deficient  mice. figure  <dig> shows that the oscillation profile of pk <dig> in the scn of opn4-/- mice is essentially identical to that observed in the wild type mice under ld. this normal temporal profile of pk <dig> mrna corresponds with the normal locomotor rhythm of opn4-/- mice under light/dark conditions  <cit> . as opn4-/- mice display attenuated phase resetting in response to light pulses and exhibit impaired light masking responses to bright light  <cit> , we also examined whether light inducibility of pk <dig> is blunted in opn4-/- mice. figure 3b shows that light pulse-induced pk <dig> in the scn of opn4-/- mice was significantly reduced by about 50% and 60%, one and two hours after the light pulse, respectively.

the opn4-/- light pulse studies show that a residual pk <dig> expression is still present after a light pulse, suggesting that without melanopsin, other phototransduction system can still transmit light information to induce pk <dig> expression. thus, we decided to examine the light inducibility of pk <dig> in triple knockout mice lacking melanopsin, rod and cone phototransduction systems , as these animals free run under light dark conditions  and lack masking responses to light  <cit> . figure 3c shows that the light pulse-induced pk <dig> in the scn is completely eliminated in these triple knockout mice, consistent with their malfunctioning photoentrainment systems and their lack of masking responses to light  <cit> . in addition, we also observed that pk <dig> mrna followed the free-running locomotor rhythms in these triple knockout mice , with high levels of pk <dig> during the inactive phase  and low levels during active phase . together, these results suggest that melanopsin contributes to the light inducibility of pk <dig>  and intact melanopsin with functional rod/cone phototransduction systems are required for the light inducibility of pk <dig> 

a low amplitude pk <dig> rhythm is preserved in cryptochrome-deficient  mice under light/dark conditions
previous studies have shown that the light-regulated per <dig> rhythm is maintained in the scn of cryptochrome-deficient  mice that lack functional circadian clock  <cit> . in order to determine whether the regulation of pk <dig>  per <dig>  per <dig> and bmal <dig> expression by light requires an intact circadian pacemaker, we systematically assessed the temporal mrna profiles of clockwork genes in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice under both light/dark  and constant dark  conditions. figure  <dig> shows that the molecular rhythm of per <dig> remained largely intact in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice entrained under12l:12d, with levels about 4-fold higher during the light phase than the dark phase. this amplitude of the per <dig> oscillation profile was similar to that observed in wild type mice  <cit> . a low amplitude per <dig> rhythm in cry1-/-cry2-/ mice was also apparent under ld, but not dd . we further detected a light-driven bmal <dig> rhythm in the scn of cry1-/-cry2-/- mice under ld, but not dd . interestingly, this bmal <dig> rhythm in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice peaked during light phase, opposite from the bmal <dig> rhythm in wild type mice and in phase with per <dig>  <cit> . as it has been suggested that per <dig> can positively regulate bmal <dig> expression via inhibition of the orphan nuclear receptor rev-erbα  <cit> , it is possible that this bmal <dig> rhythm is secondary to the light-driven per <dig> rhythm. further studies are required to clarify this observation.

we also examined the molecular rhythm of pk <dig> in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice. figure 4d shows that pk <dig> mrna rhythm in the scn of cry1-/-cry2-/- mice was apparent under ld, with the presence of a low level pk <dig> during light phase and absence of pk <dig> during dark phase . similar to wild type mice, the peak level of this low amplitude pk <dig> rhythm was around zt <dig>  although its peak was only about 8% of that observed in wild type mice . no pk <dig> rhythm was evident when cry1-/-cry2-/- mice were placed under dd . furthermore, the inducibility of pk <dig> to nocturnal light pulses is also maintained in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice. pk <dig> mrna increased one and two hours after a brief light pulse at zt <dig> . nevertheless, light-induced pk <dig> was still detected in per <dig> ,3-/- mice and clk-/- mice that lack functional circadian clock . as pk <dig> remains responsive to light in these clock mutant mice that lack functional circadian clock, it is likely that the low amplitude pk <dig> rhythm in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice under ld is directly driven by light.

in order to test whether this light-driven pk <dig> rhythm may be related to the maintenance of behavioural rhythms observed in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice under ld, we studied the responses of cry1-/-cry2-/- mice to a  <dig> hour advance of lighting schedule. in contrast to the transients of entrainment of locomotor rhythms in wild type mice , the locomotor activity of cry1-/-cry2-/- mice adjusted rapidly to  <dig> hr advance . such a rapid response is characteristic of masking. a correlative rapid adjustment of pk <dig> was also observed in the scn of cry1-/-cry2-/- mice . as cry1-/-cry2-/- mice lack functional circadian clock and their locomotor behaviour and pk <dig> expression patterns are completely light driven, our results suggest that this low amplitude, light-driven rhythm of pk <dig> may contribute to or underlie the masking of locomotor behaviour in these animals.

discussion
our studies indicate that the molecular rhythm of pk <dig> in the scn is predominantly controlled by the circadian clock, with light playing a modulatory role. abrupt shifts of light/dark cycles significantly altered the phase of the pk <dig> rhythm. while pk <dig> expression re-entrained rapidly to phase delays, it takes several cycles of transients for pk <dig> to be stably entrained to phase advances . the rate of re-entrainment of pk <dig> molecular rhythms to these shifts is consistent with that of behavioural adaptation of animals and human subjects  <cit> . our photoperiod studies indicate that pk <dig> expression in the scn responds differentially to changes in photoperiod length . although increasing light period can induce pk <dig> expression and expand the duration of pk <dig> rhythm , shortening of the light period does not lead to corresponding reduction of the duration of pk <dig> expression . it appears that a minimal duration of pk <dig> expression is maintained under short photoperiod  and constant darkness  <cit> , which further indicate the dominant control of pk <dig> expression by the circadian clock. interestingly, the amplitude of the pk <dig> oscillation was greatly reduced under very long photoperiod  . as the amplitude of both per <dig> and per <dig> rhythms were also reduced during 20l:4d , it is likely that these depressed rhythms of clockwork genes may contribute to the depressed pk <dig> rhythm observed. whether reduction in the amplitude of expression in any of these genes is related to arrhythmicity in ll deserves further examination.

our studies with cry1-/-cry2-/- mice revealed the presence of a light-driven pk <dig> molecular rhythm in the scn under ld, indicating that light can drive pk <dig> rhythm independent of functional circadian clock. interestingly, the molecular rhythms of some clockwork genes such as per <dig>  per <dig>  and bmal <dig> were also partially maintained in the scn of cry1-/-cry2-/- mice under ld . thus, light-driven molecular oscillations of clockwork or clock-controlled output genes exist in the absence of functional circadian clock. vitaterna et al  first noticed such light-regulated per <dig> molecular rhythm in the scn of cry1-/-cry2-/- mice, and suggested the term of "light-driving" effect  <cit> . as cry1-/-cry2-/- mice lack functional circadian clocks and their locomotor behaviour remains rhythmic under ld, but not under dd conditions  <cit> , it is likely that these light-driven molecular rhythms may drive the locomotor rhythms in these animals. as we have previously shown that pk <dig> may be a critical output molecule responsible for circadian locomotor rhythms, the presence of this light-driven pk <dig> rhythm in cry1-/-cry2-/- mice may thus contribute to or underlie masking as well as the free running behavioural rhythms in these animals. it is well established that an intact scn is necessary for the preservation of free running locomotor rhythms  <cit> . the role of the scn in masking of locomotor activity by light is controversial, with similar studies having produced contradictory results  <cit> . thus, it is possible that there might be common signal molecule that mediate the light-masking and the circadian clock-controlled locomotor behaviour. construction of pk2-deficient mice will be necessary to resolve the exact role of pk <dig> in the light-driven locomotor rhythms.

the light inducibility of pk <dig> in the scn is an unusual characteristic for a clock-controlled gene. our results demonstrate that melanopsin-positive retinal ganglion cells, in conjunction with rods and cones, are responsible for the light-inducibility of pk <dig> . the same photoreceptive system has been shown responsible for the entrainment of locomotor rhythm  <cit> . the light inducibility of pk <dig> may be related to the presence of a putative cyclic amp response element  in the promoter of the pk <dig> gene  <cit> . cre-dependent activation is critical for light-induced gene expression in the scn  <cit> . the reduced light inducibility of pk <dig> in mutant mice that lack functional clock may indicate that cre-dependent pathway and clk/bmal <dig> transcriptional factors may interact in the light-induced pk <dig> expression in the scn. accumulative data have implicated the photic regulation of the transcription of clock genes such as per <dig> and per <dig> in the entrainment of behavioural rhythms  <cit> . the phase of the core scn clock gene expression determines the timing of clock-controlled scn output signals that ultimately regulate physiology and behaviour. unlike the per <dig> promoter, whose activation in the scn shifts rapidly when the ld cycle is advanced  <cit> , pk <dig> exhibits transients during phase advance, more similar to those of cry <dig> and cry <dig>  <cit> . this is consistent with the role for pk <dig> as a clock-controlled gene and thus is downstream from the light-regulated expression of per <dig> or per <dig>  the presence of e box motifs in the pk <dig> promoter suggests that light-regulated per <dig>  expression can influence pk <dig> expression. however, the light inducibility of pk <dig> indicates that pk <dig> may have a more direct and central role in entrainment in addition to its putative role as an scn output signal. in other words, whether pk <dig> functions completely outside the central circadian loops or partly within them has yet to be determined. it is well established that the activation of glutamate receptor and its downstream actions are critical for the retinohypothalamic inputs of light to the scn  <cit> . as receptor for pk <dig> is highly expressed in the scn  <cit>  and activation of the pk <dig> receptor triggers similar signalling pathways as that of glutamate receptors  <cit> , it is possible that the circadian clock and/or light-driven pk <dig> may feed back to the core circadian loops in the scn. in addition, pk <dig> has recently been shown to excite neurons that express pk <dig> receptor  <cit> , further suggesting that pk <dig> may activate the firing of scn neurons, and thus possibly participate in the synchronization of the circadian clock. thus, the light inducibility of pk <dig> may be relevant to both the phase resetting of the core circadian loops and critical scn output signals.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies demonstrate that pk <dig> is predominantly driven by the circadian clock, as pk <dig> expression exhibits circadian transients in response to phase advances. furthermore, shortening of the light period does not result in corresponding reduction of the phase of pk <dig> rhythm, also consistent with the dominant control from the circadian clock on pk <dig> expression. however, light also modulates pk <dig> rhythm. nocturnal light pulses can directly induce pk <dig> expression in the scn. studies with cry1-/-cry2-/- mice revealed that light can drive a low amplitude pk <dig> molecular rhythm in the scn in the absence of functional circadian oscillators. these studies demonstrate that pk <dig> molecular rhythm in the scn is controlled by dual mechanisms: dominantly by the circadian transcriptional loops but also directly by light. the light inducibility of pk <dig> in the scn suggest that in addition to pk2's role as a scn output signal, pk <dig> may also participate in the photic entrainment of circadian clock and perhaps in masking.
