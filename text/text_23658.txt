BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphisms , representing single base differences between individuals, are a common form of genome variation  <cit> . once identified, snps have the potential to be used as genotyping markers for population assignment or in phylogeographic analysis, and are rapidly becoming the marker of choice within this field of study  <cit> . the emergence of high-throughput  sequencing technologies provides an unparalleled opportunity for the cost-effective sequencing of targeted genomic regions for snp identification. ht sequencing has been applied for snp discovery in humans  <cit> , animals  <cit> , plants  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit>  - in species where reference genomes exist. in organisms lacking a sequenced reference genome, snps have also been mined from the random sequencing of either expressed sequence tags   <cit>  or reduced representation libraries  <cit> . however, with an available reference sequence, specific genetic regions of interest can be amplified using pcr prior to ht sequencing. the sequence reads of about  <dig> bp obtained using the titanium gs flx chemistry  make the  <dig> sequencing platform particularly suitable for sequencing pcr generated amplicons. this approach involves the emulsion based amplification of individual pcr products and simultaneous, parallel pyrosequencing of dna strands  <cit> .

mitochondrial dna  has been widely used in studies of phylogenetics, molecular ecology and phylogeography in a range of organisms, including the atlantic salmon based on rflp or sequences from using sanger technology  <cit> . as snps represent the main form of polymorphism observed in the mtdna, recent research has been focused upon the identification of a geographically informative mitochondrial snp panel suitable for high-throughput genotyping   <cit> .

traditional sanger-based sequencing methods are relatively expensive and time-consuming, restricting the number of individuals and gene regions that can be sequenced, given the funding available for most studies. consequently, often a relatively few individuals from restricted geographical areas have been sequenced in order to obtain snp panels. the snps have been subsequently used to screen larger samples from a broader geographical range  <cit> , which has led to low power in resolving lineages and their relationships. it has also raised potentially serious concerns associated with ascertainment bias, such as the situation whereby inferences are significantly conditioned by the gene region screened or the populations used to identify the polymorphisms. the latter could potentially lead to a biased interpretation of the extent to which individuals and populations are related.

ht sequencing technologies offer the potential to overcome these limitations by allowing the rapid and economic sequencing of large genome regions. however, most applications of ht technology to-date have been designed to sequence a large number of fragments from relatively few individuals. in this study, a novel approach was developed by combining the traditional pcr amplification of known gene regions with  <dig> titanium flx  sequencing. this approach allowed the sequencing of extensive regions of the mtdna genome within a broad sample group both quickly and in accordance with a limited budget. the method was tested on the atlantic salmon  - a fish extensively surveyed using both nuclear  <cit>  and mitochondrial dna markers, including a mtdna snp variation  <cit> , and for which  <dig> nuclear snps and  <dig> mtdna snps  <cit>  have already been reported. here,  <dig> samples from  <dig> locations throughout the species' geographical range were screened for  <dig> bp, encompassing approximately 43% of the mtdna genome in order to minimize the degree of ascertainment bias relative to previous comparable studies.

RESULTS
pcr amplification
 <dig> s. salar samples derived from across the species' north atlantic range were included in this study . in addition,  <dig> brown trout and  <dig> arctic charr samples were included in the sequencing setup as a part of another study. the samples were divided into  <dig> groups, each composed of  <dig> samples . ten regions of the s. salar mitochondrial genome covering the d-loop region and nine coding genes  were selected for the snp detection , taking into account those regions previously shown to have high levels of polymorphism by studies of est libraries and genome sequencing  <cit> . some of the target regions were divided into 2- <dig> amplicons of about  <dig> bp, which is the average sequence length obtained with the flx titanium chemistry . thus, each sample was subjected to a total of  <dig> pcr reactions. for each of the  <dig> sample groups,  <dig> pcr reactions were carried out separately . single pcr products of the expected sizes were obtained from the majority of the  <dig>  reactions performed. only  <dig> pcr reactions  with s. salar dna yielded low quantities of amplified products, despite optimization. geographic bias was not pronounced; although the amplification of approximately half of the samples from two rivers produced low yields. this could be attributed to limited or low quality dna isolated from the corresponding samples .

the amplicon sequences without primers within each region do not overlap . accordingly, the total number of bp analyzed from the mitochondrion dna was  <dig> 

pyrosequencing and amplicon analysis
the pcr products for each group were pooled for sequencing in near equimolar concentrations and the sequencing was carried out as described in materials and methods. the pyrosequencing yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> filter passed base pairs. an average of  <dig> , <dig> bp  was obtained from each of the  <dig> regions on the picotiter plate, excluding one that yielded  <dig> , <dig> bp. the majority of sequence reads were between 400- <dig> bp, corresponding to the size of the amplicons . each pcr product contained multiplex identifying sequences , designed by roche , at both ends, which enabled the identification of the corresponding sample within a group . hence, to correctly assign a pcr product to a sample, its entire sequence was required, including both mids. the gs amplicon variant analyzer software from roche,  <dig> life sciences was used to align and assign the sequence reads. the sequences obtained were assigned to  <dig>  of the  <dig>  s. salar products targeted by pcr . the number of sequence reads  supporting a snp per individual was on average  <dig>  with a standard deviation of  <dig> . the yield of sequenced s. salar amplicons was generally high, with less than  <dig> % of samples missing on average. the exception to this observation was amplicon  <dig> , where no sequences were obtained for  <dig> of  <dig> s. salar samples .

snp analysis
the gs amplicon variant analyzer software identified a total of  <dig> variants following alignment of the raw sequence data. applying the first stringency filter, requiring sequence reads from both dna strands, reduced this number to  <dig>  after rejecting variants resulting from potential sequencing errors, including under-reads of homopolymer regions, and single base insertions, the variants were confined to those confirmed in at least 90% of replicate sequence reads. subsequently,  <dig> variants remained. thereof,  <dig> variants were rejected since they occurred in only one individual. consequently, the alignment analysis and filtering yielded a total of  <dig> variants, consisting of  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels. maps of the s. salar mitochondrial genome, indicating the regions selected for the snp analysis and the accepted snps for each region are shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. . the greatest number of snps was observed in the nd <dig> gene region , whilst the lowest number  was observed in the nd <dig> gene. when considered as a proportion of the length of each region, the d-loop had the highest density of snps  whilst the cox <dig> region gene yielded the least . of the variants observed,  <dig> are transitions while  <dig> are transversions, and nearly half of the latter is located in the d-loop region . in three cases  both a transition and transversion were observed at the same locus in different samples. indels were only observed within the d-loop region, with a two bp insertion  at bp  <dig> and a two bp deletion at bp  <dig>  when compared to previous studies of smaller  <cit>  and more geographically constrained discovery panels  <cit> ,  <dig> of the snps and one of the indels had been reported, while  <dig> new snps and one indel were identified in this study . when this data is considered according to populations,  <dig> % of snps were found in all geographic locations, whilst  <dig> % existed in only one. additionally, a further  <dig> % were found in less than  <dig> populations, whilst  <dig> % were found in more than 50% of populations.

discussion
next generation sequencing technology, such as  <dig> sequencing, is rapidly expanding the possibility for snp mining by genome sequencing within a reasonable budget. however, the technology to-date has generally been restricted to the sequencing of large regions of the genome using relatively few samples  <cit> . in this work, a large snp ascertainment panel was obtained at a relatively low cost by amplifying multiple regions of a mitochondrial genome in numerous samples and their subsequent sequencing using the  <dig> technology. the resultant snp panel provides the least likelihood of ascertainment bias  <cit> , with a discovery panel of  <dig> samples from  <dig> locations across the north atlantic range of s. salar, making this the most informative and geographically comprehensive snp panel for the species to-date .

the cost of sequencing using the  <dig> platform was minimized by carefully designing the experiment to require only a single pyrosequencing run, whilst obtaining sufficient sequence reads in both directions to yield a robust result, essentially minimizing false positives and avoid missing true polymorphisms from each ~ <dig> bp read. the most challenging aspect faced was the need to ensure that each individual amplicon of a given type could be traced to the original sample. this was achieved using a sequencing plate with a 16-region gasket, and a set of 5' mid primer sequences. to decrease the primer cost , the necessary adaptor sequences for the  <dig> sequencing were ligated to the pcr products instead of including them in the primer sequences; this may have also reduced complications in the pcr reactions due to the shorter 5' non-complementary primer sequences. thus, sequencing libraries were prepared for the  <dig> pcr pools using the gs flx titanium general library preparation protocol for shotgun sequencing, instead of using amplicon sequencing . furthermore, a taq-comparable polymerase was used for generating the pcr pools of  <dig>  reactions, instead of using an expensive high fidelity polymerase. the lack of proof-reading activity during the pcr might have increased the error rate in the sequence data, although the numerous specimens used here as well as the sequence coverage obtained should adequately compensate for this. furthermore, variations observed in a single individual were not accepted as snps in accordance with the set criteria. even if legitimate snps were necessarily discarded in this manner, their low frequency suggests that any information that was lost was probably minimal. given that there is no geographical or population association, it can be assumed that this would not compromise the informative essence of the overall snp suite, at least from the perspective of the studies of biodiversity and phylogeography. considering the high coverage obtained in this experiment, the application of a high fidelity polymerase could enable the reliable snp detection for simultaneous processing of even greater sample numbers than in the current study. thus, if the budget is not restricting, the processing capacity of the method can be further increased by applying a high fidelity polymerase to generate the amplicons, at the cost of sequence coverage.

the sequence yield in this experiment was approximately  <dig> million bp, which is within the range of 160- <dig> million bp expected for titanium  <dig> sequencing, using a 16-region gasket . however, for an undetermined reason, the sequence yield ranged from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> filter-passed base pairs between different regions of the sequencing plate. also, the sequence yield for amplicon  <dig> was relatively low in comparison to that of the other amplicons. this could be due to a bias in the sample pooling. nevertheless, the distribution of sequences was relatively similar over the sample range, resulting in an average coverage of  <dig>   sequence reads per snp per individual. the sequencing setup described here also included  <dig> brown trout and arctic charr samples. the data sets obtained for these samples were not included in this analysis, and they will be the subject of future studies. nevertheless, they are mentioned here since they were a part of the original experimental setup of  <dig> individuals divided into  <dig> groups, each with  <dig> individuals. the total number of base pairs that were to be sequenced in this study  was  <dig> , <dig> bp . the total sequence data obtained consisted of  <dig> . <dig> bp, so 39-fold coverage would therefore be expected. however, a substantial part of the sequence reads were not assigned to any sample and were consequently excluded from the analysis. the anticipated reason behind this is accounted to short sequence reads missing a mid from either end. fusing mid sequences to only one end of an amplicon should reduce this problem and increase the number of analysed sequence reads. this practice, however, reduces the number of samples, which can be analysed simultaneously, although with the emergence of new mid sequences validated for  <dig> sequencing, more samples with only one mid could be assigned.

although the existence of mids on both ends of a sequence read was requisite in order to assign it to the corresponding individual, some global and consensi alignments  included partial sequences. this was the result of default stringency levels causing parts of some sequences with low quality bases to be discarded. the trimming was however performed following the alignment of the sequence reads. hence, as the design of the mids allows for  two sequencing errors, these partial sequences could still be assigned to the corresponding individual prior to the trimming.

as expected for high-throughput sequencing methods, which produce high amounts of reads, numerous deviations from the reference sequence were observed in the raw data. the stringent criteria applied here for the snp validation rejected the great majority of these variants. however, the filtering may also have eliminated legitimate snps. such variants could be identified by a modest reduction in the stringency levels and verified by sanger sequencing. following the validation, about  <dig> % of the bases screened exhibited sequence variance and the final number of variants,  <dig> , is nearly double the number of mtdna snps previously reported. the new snps are predominantly transitions although the number of transversions is relatively high in the non-coding d-loop region . similar transition/transversion ratios were observed in other studies on the genetic variability of the s. salar mitochondrion  <cit> . the  <dig> new snps and a new indel identified in this study are indicated in figure  <dig> in red letters. although the average number of sequence reads supporting the new snps per individual is similar to that of those reported, the number of individuals harbouring the new snps is generally lower . this is due to the numerous samples and the great geographical range analyzed here, which consequently allowed the detection of new rare variants. the greater the number of amplicons and individuals screened, the more likely it is that an accurate picture of the extent and nature of snp variation will be revealed, and that a suite of snp markers for population genetic studies can be compiled. the challenge remains to determine the optimal balance between the number of amplicons , the number of populations  and the number of individuals per population for studies of matrilineal variation in the target species, atlantic salmon. this will only be achieved by a detailed analysis of the within and among population variation and a consideration of the robustness of its evolutionary and phylogeographic implications. it should, however, provide a basis for robust inferences concerning the general levels of genetic diversity in the species and broad scale, deep phylogenetic structuring. given, though, that the geographical sampling is extensive rather than intensive, and that sample sizes per population are limited, the ability to resolve any finer scale, shallower evolutionary structuring on the regional level will be diminished. to achieve the latter, a more focused and intensive search, based on sequencing of the entire mtdna genome from more individuals would be of greater use since a higher proportion of regionally or population restricted or low frequency polymorphisms could be detected.

the analysis of within and among population distribution of variation is currently underway and can be expected to yield considerable insights into the phylogeography and matrilineal evolution of the atlantic salmon. analysis of the linkage of variation and its spatial distribution should also assist in the identification of a subset of the overall snp suite that can be genetically typed more cost-effectively using pcr-based snp assays. the snp subset could then be investigated within samples from a wider geographical range and in archival material, in order to establish a more accurate assessment of the mixed stock assignment and population evolutionary hypotheses extracted from the current data set. additionally, the markers that were identified in the study will likely prove highly useful as genetic tags for use in the assessment of the extent of population processes such as female mediated gene flow, as well as for tracking individual family groups in experimental studies.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel approach that combines targeted pcr amplification and a single ht sequencing run proved successful in screening numerous targeted genomic regions in a large number of individuals. this technique presents a valuable tool for the identification of snps for population studies in other species, and also minimizes the risks of ascertainment bias associated with previous approaches that screened either confined regions of the genome or only several individuals from few populations.
