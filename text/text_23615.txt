BACKGROUND
origins of dna replication in budding yeast are well defined dna elements referred to as autonomously replicating sequences . they consist of a core  <dig> base pair acs  and three or four auxiliary b elements
 <cit> . acs is critical for the function of ars <cit> . it is the main site of binding of the origin recognition complex , which nucleates the formation of pre-replicative complexes in g1
 <cit> . it has been shown that the flanking sequences of the core acs can also contribute to the binding of orc thus producing the  <dig> base pair extended acs 
 <cit> . compared to acs, the b elements are not so well characterized and their roles are poorly understood. b <dig> is believed to act as a site of dna unwinding that allows for the initiation of replication
 <cit> . b <dig> is a binding site for abf1p
 <cit> . while the significance of these elements for the activity of the origins is apparent, the mechanism of their action is unclear. the b <dig> element is positioned about  <dig> bases upstream of the core acs. using ars <dig> as a model, it has been shown that b <dig> acts as a second binding site for orc
 <cit> . earlier studies have proposed an awny consensus  <dig> bases upstream of acs <cit> . a more comprehensive analysis and alignment of multiple origins has shown better agreement for a wtw motif positioned 15– <dig> bases upstream of the core acs <cit> . mutations in these wtw motifs have substantially reduced the replicator activity of most of the tested origins
 <cit> . it has been proposed that the b <dig> element together with the extended acs produce a variety of bi-partite sites that bind orc with different affinities
 <cit> .

besides their role in dna replication, ars and orc play a central role in gene silencing at the constitutively repressed mating type loci hml and hmr and in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes
 <cit> . the silencers, which flank hml and hmr and impose complete shut-off of the genes between them, are built up of various combinations of binding sites for abf1p and rap1p plus one of four arss   <cit> . mutations in the acs of these arss substantially reduce gene repression and confer inability to mate
 <cit> . interestingly, at the hml-i and hmr-e silencers the orientation of the acs-b <dig> elements of the arss has a directional effect on the levels of gene repression
 <cit> . multiple arss are also found in the core x and y’ subtelomeric regions
 <cit> . at these positions they act as proto-silencers meaning that they relay and enhance the repression signals emitted by the telomeres
 <cit> . it is not known if these arss have directional function. the arss at the subtelomeric and the mating type loci rarely fire at their native locations thus strengthening the notion that they have a silencing function independent of the initiation of dna replication. however, when moved to a mini-chromosome or at different genomic position, these arss can fire as efficiently as any other ars <cit> . the basis of this dual function of arss is not fully understood
 <cit> .

recent studies have shown that targeted mutations in the putative b <dig>  motifs of certain arss have little effect on their replicator activity
 <cit> . it is unclear if the same mutations affect gene silencing. it remains possible that such arss contain a b <dig> at a different position. ultimately, it is unclear if b <dig> plays a role in ars-dependent gene silencing. in this study we have tested the role of b <dig> by parallel silencing and replicator assays. we have found that the putative b <dig> elements of two silencer arss  are dispensable for both activities.

RESULTS
experimental strategy
to address the role of b <dig> in gene silencing, we isolated two silencer ars  and two well-characterized replicator ars . these were inserted next to the viil telomere in acs-b <dig> and b1-acs orientation  and the silencing of the adjacent ura <dig> was assessed. in addition, we performed scanning mutagenesis of the b <dig> elements of these arss and estimated the effects of the mutations on their silencer and replicator activity .
 <dig>  statistical significance  for the difference between the control construct  and the arss in ura3-b1-acs-tel orientation are shown next to each bar. the p values for the constructs in ura3-acs-b1-tel orientation are significantly lower than  <dig>  and are not shown.
 <dig>  statistical significance  of the difference between the non-mutated construct and some of the mutants are shown next to each bar. the p values for the remaining constructs are significantly above  <dig>  and are not shown. b. the arss and their mutant derivatives were cloned between cen <dig> and ura <dig> to produce mini-chromosomes as indicated on the top of the figure. all mini-chromosomes were transformed in w <dig> cells and loss per generation was calculated. data is from table

 <dig> 

the silencer activity of all the arss was assessed by a routine tpe  assay
 <cit> . the rationale of the assay is as follows: telomeres recruit multiple rap <dig> proteins, which in turn recruit sir2/3/ <dig> proteins
 <cit> . the sir proteins then spread over and de-acetylate the neighboring nucleosomes to establish a heterochromatin domain
 <cit> . depending on the scope of spreading, subtelomeric genes are either active or completely repressed and infrequently switch between the two states
 <cit> . when ura <dig> is inserted at the viil telomere  the proportion of repressed ura <dig> within a cell population is modulated by the strength of the subtelomeric proto-silencer elements
 <cit> . this proportion is easily assessed as %foa resistant cells  is converted to a toxin by the enzyme encoded by ura3)) <cit> . hence, in our assays the per cent foa-resistant cells represents the proto-silencer strength of the engineered arss.

parallel assays were conducted to test how the mutations in the b <dig> elements affect the replicator activity of the four arss and if these effects correlate to the decrease in ars-driven silencing . to this end, all wild type and mutant ars fragments were sub-cloned in mini-chromosomes containing cen <dig> and ura <dig>  and mini-chromosome stability assays were performed. ars/cen mini-chromosomes are replicated once per cell cycle and are properly segregated during mitosis. their normal loss rate is about 3-5% per generation
 <cit> . in our analyses any increase in the loss rate is indicative of malfunctioning of the origin. this assay provides a highly sensitive measure of the activity of the origins and has been instrumental in the deciphering of the regulatory elements in many ars’s.

the orientation of arss determines the level of telomeric silencing
it has previously been shown that ars <dig> exerts orientation-dependent silencing when the whole hmr-e silencer is moved to the hml locus
 <cit> . the possibility of directional silencing prompted us to establish an orientation in which all analysed arss would produce similar levels of ura <dig> silencing. ars <dig>  ars <dig>  ars <dig> and ars <dig> were sub-cloned in both directions  and then inserted between adh <dig> and the viil telomere of w <dig> cells as described previously
 <cit> . consistent with their established role as proto-silencers
 <cit> , in the ura3acs-b1-tel orientation all arss increased the proportion of foa resistant  cells to 67-81% relative to 36% in the construct with no ars . no significant difference between silencer and replicator ars was observed. in the opposite ura3b1-acs-tel orientation ars <dig> produced foar values comparable to the construct without any ars . remarkably, ars <dig>  ars <dig> and especially ars <dig> produced statistically significant decrease  of silencing relative to the control thus clearly displaying anti-silencing properties. in summary, the orientation of ars relative to the telomere has a major impact on the level of subtelomeric silencing. from a technical point of view, in the ura3acs-b1-tel orientation all arss showed similar proportions of foar cells that allow for direct comparison of the role of their b <dig> elements in gene silencing.

the same b <dig> elements in ars <dig> and ars <dig> contribute to gene silencing and dna replication
next, we measured the contribution of the b <dig> elements to dna replication and to gene silencing. we mutagenized the replicators  and silencers  in the region encompassing their putative b <dig>  motifs by replacing two bases at a time . all wild type and mutant arss were cloned in adh4-ura3-acs-b1-tel orientation, inserted in the viil telomere and subjected to the foa-resistance assays. in parallel, the same arss were cloned in ura3/cen <dig> mini-chromosomes and tested for their replicator activity. the substitutions in the wtw motifs  of ars <dig> and ars <dig> caused statistically significant decrease in the proportion of foar cells relative to their non-mutated counterparts . the flanking sequences in ars <dig> had little effect, while in ars <dig> they produced some minor reduction in silencer activity. in the mini-chromosome stability assay exactly the same mutations caused substantial increase of the loss per generation rates . there is a good agreement in the magnitude of effects in the two assays with all mutants tested . these observations indicate that the same b <dig> elements in ars <dig> and ars <dig> contribute to their silencer and replicator activity.

silencer arss lack functionally identifiable b1
similar analyses of the two silencer arss  showed that none of the two-base substitutions in the vicinity of the wtw element altered the levels of ura <dig> silencing . to warrant for the existence of aberrantly positioned b <dig> we expanded the scanning substitutions as compared to ars <dig> and ars <dig>  but no effects were observed. similarly, the replicator activity of ars <dig> and ars <dig> remained largely unaffected by the mutations . only one of the ars <dig> constructs showed modest increase in the loss rate of the mini-chromosome, but the mutation was outside of the canonical wtw element. clearly, both assays failed to reveal a b <dig> element in ars <dig> and ars <dig> 

discussion
lack of canonical b <dig> element
while the position and consensus of the b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> auxiliary elements vary between different arss, the acs-b <dig> module serves as a binary binding site for the association of orc and seems highly conserved
 <cit> . indeed, recent studies have identified a strong wtw consensus 15– <dig> bases downstream of the core acs <cit> . mutations in this b <dig> motif have caused significant loss of replicator activity in most arss <cit> , but its role in gene silencing has not been determined. even more, mutations in the wtw consensus of one silencer ars  did not affect its replicator activity
 <cit> . it seems conceivable that arss could utilize the wtw motif for replication and use an alternative b <dig> element for gene silencing
 <cit> . it also seems possible that silencer and replicator arss have different b <dig> elements and different type of interaction with orc
 <cit> . here we have addressed both possibilities. we have shown that exactly the same mutations impair the replicator and the silencing function of the tested replicator arss . hence, the answer to the first question is negative: these two functions are not determined by alternative b <dig> elements.

surprisingly, the analyses of the two silencer arss  have revealed that neither the replicator nor the silencer function was affected by any of the two-base substitutions within the  <dig> base region of the putative b <dig> . again, we failed to obtain any evidence in favor of optional usage of b <dig> in silencing and replication. however, it is apparent that ars <dig> and ars <dig> have a different b <dig> or do not possess one at all. in the core x and y’ subtelomeric elements there are more than  <dig> close matches to ars <dig> with high levels of homology in their acs-b <dig> module . we suggest that all these plus ars <dig> represent a subclass of ars with a novel type of b <dig> element or with no b <dig> element.
 <cit> . the list of arss is available upon request. the wtw consensus of the b <dig> element is shown in the rectangle. b. alignment of subtelomeric ars. ars <dig> was used to search for related sequences by blast.  <dig> matches were identified. the top  <dig> entries were all located in the subtelomeric regions. these were aligned at the acs  and analyzed by weblogo.

ars display considerable diversity of the sequences surrounding the core acs <cit> . to this diversity we add the extreme case of lack of a canonical b <dig>  this is an intriguing issue. being a secondary site for orc binding, b <dig> is expected to be important if not essential. it is possible that we have identified no b <dig> element because in silencer ars there is no second site of association for orc. for example, a specialized extended  <dig> base pair eacs <cit>  could provide a single high-affinity site for the binding of orc and minimize the significance of the b <dig> element. alternatively, these acs-b <dig> sites are bi-partite, but b <dig> is broader. if this is the case, the two-base substitutions that normally destroy the wtw in replicator arss will not work on ars <dig> and ars <dig>  indeed, the alignment of ars <dig> and other telomeric arss shows more than one potential wtw site in the area of b <dig> . the same applies to ars <dig> . however, the two ars from the hml mating type locus do not show significant similarity to the putative b <dig> regions of ars <dig> and ars <dig> . even more, the high overall homology of sub-telomeric arss  precludes the recognition of a different b <dig> even if it existed. hence, while a broader b <dig> in silencer ars remains possible, a consensus is difficult to identify. ultimately, it is possible that a combination of an extended acs <cit>  and broader b <dig> provide alternatives for the binding of orc that are hard to unveil by alignment algorithms.

within eukaryotes, budding yeasts are the only known species with well defined sequences of origins and well defined binding sites for orc. in all other species the origins are quite dissimilar and are recognizable only as a/t rich regions of dna. this study together with other recent studies
 <cit>  suggests a certain level of diversity between different ars in budding yeast. the significance of this diversity is yet to be determined.

directionality of silencing
silencers and proto-silencer in s. cerevisiae are cis-elements that serve as focal points for the recruitment of sir proteins
 <cit>  and in most cases are thought to act in bi-directional fashion. however, while selecting the optimal conditions for our silencing assays we came across strong and reproducible orientation-dependent effects. all arss were potent proto-silencers only in the ura3-acs-b1-tel orientation, the same orientation found in natural sub-telomeric ars elements. in the opposite ura3-b1-acs-tel orientation ars <dig> displayed strong anti-silencing activity while ars <dig> and ars <dig> caused modest de-repression of ura <dig>  these experiments have not been developed to establish if the acs-b <dig> module or other unknown sites within the cloned fragments exert these directional effects. however, several arguments support the idea that acs-b <dig> could play a central role. earlier research has acquired evidence for directional silencing by hmr-e when it is inserted in the hml locus
 <cit> . hmr-e consists of ars <dig> and binding sites for abf1p and rap1p. gene repression has been robust at the abf1p binding site of hmr-e and weak at the acs side
 <cit> . a stably positioned nucleosome was found adjacent to the acs site of ars <dig> and not on the side containing the b <dig> element
 <cit> . the binding sites for abf1p and rap1p also contribute to the directionality of hmr-e. it is noteworthy that, excluding ars <dig>  none of our other constructs contains identifiable abf1p or rap1p binding sites thus leaving acs-b <dig> as a likely candidate for the effects we have observed. in addition, ars <dig> and not ars <dig> displayed the strongest directional effects . if acs-b <dig> is the key directional element, a stably positioned nucleosome next to acs can stimulate the transfer of sir proteins approaching from the telomere thus acting as a relay point. in the opposite orientation, a nucleosome-free dna generated by the association of orc
 <cit>  could prevent sir protein spreading and act as a chromatin insulator
 <cit> . however, why nucleosome-free dna on one side of ars would work as insulator in one orientation is yet to be established. structural studies on orc bound to different acs-b <dig> modules can address this possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
all tested ars display proto-silencing activity in the acs-b1-tel orientation relative to the telomere. however, in the b1-acs-tel orientation ars <dig> does not show proto-silencing activity, while ars <dig>  ars <dig>  ars <dig> display anti-silencing activity. hence, there is a strong orientation dependency in the proto-silencing activity of ars. in addition, ars <dig> and ars <dig> do not possess a canonical b <dig> element thus suggesting a different acs-b <dig> module relative to ars <dig>  ars <dig> and numerous replicator ars.
