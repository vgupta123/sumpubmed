BACKGROUND
helitrons represent a new class of transposable elements recently uncovered in animals and plants  <cit> , including maize  <cit> . the first two helitrons described in maize were the causative agents of stable mutations: one in the shrunken <dig> mutant sh2- <dig>  <cit>  and another one in the barren stalk <dig> reference mutant ba1-ref  <cit> . the termini of a 6525-bp helitron in the ba1-ref mutant share striking similarity with those of the helitron insertion in the sh2- <dig> mutant, indicating that they belong to the same family. lai et al.  <cit>  reported that two helitrons, hela and helb, accounted for all of the genic differences distinguishing two previously described bz locus haplotypes  <cit> . hela is  <dig> -kb long and contains sequences for three of the four genes found only in the mcc bz-locus haplotype. a nearly identical copy of hela was isolated from a different chromosomal site in the b <dig> inbred. both sites appear to be polymorphic in maize, suggesting that these helitrons have been active recently.

basic helitron features include:

• conserved tc and ctag sequences at the 5' and 3' termini, respectively

• palindromes  10– <dig> bp upstream of the 3' terminus

• flanking a and t host nucleotides at the 5' and 3' termini, respectively

the figure  <dig> of a recent paper  <cit>  comparing helitron end sequences contains the 5' and 3' termini of the maize helitrons hela- <dig> and helb from line mcc, hela- <dig> from b <dig>  the helitron insertions in mutants sh2- <dig> and ba1-ref, and the rice helitron2_os. helitron sequences are in uppercase letters and the invariant host nucleotides where the helitrons insert are in lowercase letters. conserved nucleotides at the 5' and 3' termini are in bold uppercase letters and the inverted repeats at the 3' termini are underlined. the nonconserved body of the helitrons is represented by dots.

besides the typical helitron features they all share, there are two invariant cgs located  <dig> bp apart in each member of the palindromic repeat, the second one occurring just  <dig> bp from the 3' end. in the hela subgroup, there is an invariant aa dinucleotide between the palindromic repeats. the 3' terminal  <dig> bp of hela are very conserved with other helitrons. in fact, of those  <dig> bp, hela shares  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, with the helitrons previously identified as the causative agents of mutations at sh <dig> and ba <dig> 

one remarkable feature of helitrons is their ability to capture gene sequences, a feature that makes them of considerable potential evolutionary importance. however, because helitrons lack the typical structural features of other dna transposable elements, identifying them is a challenge. currently, most researchers identify helitrons manually by comparing sequences. for example, wang and dooner  <cit>  identified helitrons by vertical comparisons of the bz regions from  <dig> different maize inbred lines. although very precise, this approach is time consuming. just lately, one model-based identification of helitrons was introduced for arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . with the maize whole genome sequencing project underway, an automated computational helitron searching tool is needed. the characterization of helitron activities in the maize genome needs to be addressed in order to better understand the impact of helitrons on the organization of the maize genome.

RESULTS
identification of helitrons by in silico analysis
there are basically two main non-autonomous categories of helitrons in maize, hel <dig> or hela, and hel <dig> or helb. the majority of identified helitrons in maize are of the hela type , so our helitronfinder program is focussed exclusively on the prediction of maize hela type helitrons.

all the helitrons in this table, which was kindly provided by dr. s. lal, have been published. the pertinent references are listed under the "source" column. the accession numbers refer to entries in the genbank sequence database: the helitron coordinates in the sequence are identified under the "start" and "end" columns.

the 'hairpin loop' and the ctag termini at the 3' end of known helitrons are the key characteristics for the identification of new helitrons. the most challenging part is to identify the 5' end. for this purpose, we selected the first  <dig> nucleotides from the 5' end of each known helitron of table  <dig> and aligned them using clustal  <cit> . there is a strong similarity in the first  <dig> nucleotides among the aligned helitrons . the consensus from the alignment is our main criterion to search for the 5' end of new helitrons.

we chose the first  <dig> nucleotides from figure  <dig> as our 5' end search criterion:

tc  ta ta     aag. ambiguous nucleotides at a particular location are included within brackets . the 3' ends of known helitrons have ctag termini. for hela type helitrons, the double 'a' is often in the middle of the 'cg' bases in the hairpin loop . the approaches used for searching 3' ends are detailed in figure  <dig> 

we downloaded maize sequences from the genbank non-redundant database to our local sun workstation and used the helitronfinder program to predict helitron candidates. there are  <dig> and  <dig> predicted helitrons in our "high quality" and "medium quality" outputs, respectively. the output files are in text format, with a genbank accession number for each predicted helitron. outputs specifically identify helitron sequences as being in a forward or reverse complement orientation. the helitronfinder program also successfully identified all the known helitrons listed in table  <dig> 

confirmation of helitrons by molecular analysis
we randomly selected five predicted helitrons from the program's high quality output for molecular verification. pcr primers were designed based on the flanking sequence of each predicted helitron. we surveyed  <dig> maize inbred and genetic lines for three of the five helitron candidates and  <dig> lines for the other two. four sets of primers successfully amplified either the helitron-occupied or the helitron-vacant site from different lines. the pcr products highlighted in bold in table  <dig> were cloned and sequenced for further confirmation.

silico  <dig>  silico  <dig>  silico  <dig>  and silico  <dig> are helitron candidates predicted by the helitronfinder program. 4co <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  bsss <dig>  h <dig>  m <dig>  mo <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  cml <dig>  i <dig> tn, and ki <dig> are inbred lines. mcc and bz-r are genetic lines. vacant: amplified pcr product lacks a helitron.

occupied: amplified pcr product contains a helitron, which was confirmed by sequencing.

x: no pcr product detected.

blank: line not tested for the corresponding helitron candidate.

the pcr products highlighted in yellow have been cloned and sequenced for further confirmation.

four out of five selected predicted helitrons were confirmed by pcr products from different maize inbred lines . they are named silico  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and are predicted from bsss <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and mcc sequences, respectively. the "occupied" and "vacant" entries denote pcr bands corresponding to the presence and absence of helitrons, respectively. the x sign stands for no pcr amplification product. in addition to the inbreds from whose sequences they were predicted, helitrons were detected in other inbreds. thus, silico  <dig> is present in w <dig>  besides bsss <dig>  but absent in eight other inbred lines; silico  <dig> is present in 4co <dig>  a <dig>  mcc, m <dig>  and w <dig>  besides b <dig>  but absent in h <dig> and mo17; silico  <dig> is present in a <dig>  besides b <dig>  but absent in mcc, w <dig>  w <dig>  and a bz-r genetic line, and silico  <dig> is present in m <dig> and w <dig>  besides mcc, but absent in 4co <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  h <dig>  mo <dig>  cml <dig>  i137tn, and bz-r.

silico <dig> was predicted from the bsss <dig> sequence. a helitron-occupied site was also detected in w <dig> while helitron-vacant sites were detected in 4co <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  mcc, h <dig>  m <dig>  mo <dig>  and w <dig> . this result reveals +/- polymorphism among different inbred lines and confirms that the predicted helitron, silico <dig>  is genuine.

silico <dig> was predicted from the b <dig> maize sequences. a total of  <dig> maize lines were used for molecular verification of this helitronfinder prediction . both b <dig> and a <dig> show helitron occupied sites, whereas lines mcc, a <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  and bz-r show helitron vacant sites. in addition to the helitron band amplified from b <dig>  there was a faint band of the same size as the vacant site. we cloned and sequenced this product and confirmed it to be a vacant site.

characterizations of helitrons in the maize genome
discovery of two adjacent helitrons
the helitronfinder program identified two adjacent, head-to-tail helitrons in a maize bac sequence with genbank accession number af <dig> . this is the first case of back-to-back helitrons detected in the maize genome. a peculiarity of these head-to-tail helitron configurations is that the tc 5' terminus of the second helitron follows the ctag 3' terminus of the first, creating a novel g/t junction, rather than the a/t junction normally found at a helitron's 5' end. pritham and feschotte  <cit>  reported several cases of perfect head-to-tail junctions of two helitron elements in the genome of the bat myotis lucifugus. they suggested that these were tandem repeats of helitrons in the myotis lucifugus genome. they also argued that one would expect the a of the host target site to occur between the ctag end of the first element and the tc start of the second element if the elements had inserted independently. we aligned these two adjacent maize helitrons and found that the sequences differed significantly and contained different genes or gene fragments. this indicates they are not tandem repeats, but arose by consecutive insertions.

we designed four pairs of primers for these two helitrons, f1/r <dig>  f3/r <dig>  f2/r <dig>  and f4/r <dig> . f and r represent forward and reverse primers, respectively. according to the pcr products in table  <dig>  we detected both helitrons in lines a <dig> and b <dig>  only helitron no. <dig> in lines mcc, w <dig>  and w <dig>  and neither helitron in lines a <dig>  cml <dig>  h <dig>  ki <dig>  m <dig>  or mo <dig>  this result lends itself to two interpretations. one possibility is that helitron no. <dig>  inserted into the maize genome first and that helitron no. <dig>  inserted subsequently, and noncanonically, at the gt dinucleotide found at the 3' end of helitron no. <dig>  an alternative is that helitron no. <dig> inserted first and helitron no. <dig> inserted subsequently, and canonically, at the at dinucleotide created by the host a and the t at the 5' end of helitron no. <dig>  following the formation of this head-to-tail configuration , helitron no. <dig> would have excised cleanly , leaving only helitron no. <dig> at the insertion site .

pcr results from different primer combinations.

+: helitron present

-: helitron absent

x: no pcr amplification

n/a: no pcr test

conclusions were based on pcr results. both no. <dig> and no. <dig> helitrons were detected in lines a <dig> and b <dig>  only helitron no. <dig> in lines mcc, w <dig>  and w <dig>  and neither helitron in lines a <dig>  cml <dig>  h <dig>  ki <dig>  m <dig>  or mo <dig>  no conclusion could be reached for 4co <dig>  bsss <dig>  and i <dig> tn based on the above pcr results.

a putative helitron somatic excision
we further cloned and sequenced the pcr products of silico <dig> from lines a <dig>  b <dig>  mcc, w <dig>  w <dig>  and bz-r. fig.  <dig> presents the sequence alignment showing the insertion of the predicted helitron silico <dig> in a <dig> and b <dig>  there is no helitron insertion in mcc , w <dig>  w <dig>  or bz-r. the sequence results validate the helitronfinder's prediction. it is interesting that, in addition to an occupied site, b <dig> also shows a weak silico <dig> vacant-site-sized band . sequencing of this pcr product confirmed it to be an unoccupied site . there are no sequence polymorphisms in the adjacent sequences to rule out the possibility that this band arose from dna contamination in the b <dig> dna preparation. alternatively, however, this band may represent helitron somatic excision products, which have been found at other polymorphic sites in maize . this is a surprising result in light of the fact that helitrons presumably transpose by a rolling circle transposition mechanism that does not generate empty sites.

deletion of helitron flanking regions
the pcr products of silico <dig>  from a <dig>  b <dig>  bsss <dig>  mo <dig>  w <dig>  and 4co <dig> were also cloned and sequenced. in addition to the bsss <dig> inbred line from which silico <dig> was predicted, we were able to amplify and sequence the 5' end of silico <dig> from w <dig>  the sequences of silico  <dig> occupied and vacant sites are aligned in fig.  <dig>  silico <dig> is present in w <dig> and bsss <dig> and absent from b <dig>  a <dig>  4co <dig>  and mo <dig>  the 3' flanking region in b <dig> is identical to that in bsss <dig>  however, the 3' end flanking regions of silico <dig> in a <dig>  4co <dig>  and mo <dig> are missing  <dig> nucleotides. the presence of the same deletion in three different lines points to a common origin of this chromosomal segment. possibly, the deletion arose following the imprecise excision of silico  <dig> from an occupied site in a common progenitor of these lines.

discussion
helitrons are novel transposons that have not been well characterized experimentally. implementing our maize helitron discovery algorithm, we found two adjacent helitrons, which we arbitrarily named no. <dig> and no. <dig>  in the r <dig> region of b <dig> . here, we propose two models for how these adjacent helitron arose. one hypothesis is that these are tandem repeats, which arose by the helitron's rolling circle mechanism of replication, as postulated by pritham and feschotte  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis is that one helitron inserted next to an existing helitron. the sequence data support the latter model. helitron no. <dig> contains an s-receptor kinase gene with only one exon, whereas helitron no.  <dig> carries an aldose reductase gene. we attempted to align these two helitrons, excluding the s-receptor kinase and aldose reductase genes. there are large differences between the two helitrons, indicating that helitrons no.  <dig> and no.  <dig> do not represent tandem repeats. our characterization of pcr products from several maize lines support the second hypothesis of two independent insertions, but the order of insertion is not clear. helitron no.  <dig> could have inserted first, and no. <dig> subsequently, next to the 3' end of no. <dig>  in which case no. <dig> would have inserted at a gt site, instead of the canonical at site. alternatively, the two helitrons could have inserted in reverse order, followed by the precise excision of helitron no. <dig> in a common progenitor of modern maize lines having only helitron no.  <dig> at the insertion site.

most known helitrons in table  <dig> carry gene fragments and not fully functional genes. one of the two adjacent helitrons  contains a gene with only one exon. we searched genbank with both nucleotide and amino acid sequence queries and found a cognate single-exon gene in rice. this may indicate that helitron no.  <dig> carries a fully functional gene. it is not clear at this point how helitrons acquire host sequences, but it is important to learn if helitrons have the ability to trap fully functional genes and mobilize them around the genome. more studies need to be conducted to determine if the gene inserted into helitron no. <dig> is a fully functional gene.

we detected a putative helitron excision product in the b <dig> inbred , but could not rule out dna contamination because of the absence of polymorphisms in the adjacent sequences. all four predicted helitrons are present in some inbred lines and absent in others. this shows that helitrons are active in the maize genome. we speculate that insertions and excisions of helitrons can cause changes in the flanking regions, as the 38-bp deletion shown in fig.  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> new helitron candidates in maize with our computational tool helitronfinder. four out of five candidates were confirmed to be real by empirical methods, thus validating the predictions of our program. additional points to emerge from our study are that helitrons may not always insert at an at dinucleotide in the host sequences, that they can insert immediately adjacent to an existing helitron, and that helitron movement may cause changes in the flanking region, such as deletions.
