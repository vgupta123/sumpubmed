BACKGROUND
the syrian golden hamster  is susceptible to, and has been used as a model for, a number of human pathogens, including leishmania  spp. , l. donovani  <cit> , trypanosoma cruzi  <cit> , entamoeba histolytica  <cit> , leptospira and treponema  <cit> , hantavirus  <cit> , eastern equine encephalitis virus  <cit> , yellow fever virus  <cit> , west nile virus  <cit> , nipah virus  <cit> , and hookworm  <cit> . in some cases, hamster models of infection provide a unique opportunity to determine mechanisms of disease and immunity because the human infection is more closely mimicked in this animal than in other animal models. studies of immunopathogenesis in hamster infection models are challenging, however, because of the limited availability of reagents needed to define cellular and molecular determinants. for the most part, antibodies directed against mouse and rat proteins do not cross-react with the hamster orthologs, and the lack of a fully annotated genome sequence limits broad interrogation of the genome and transcriptome.

the leishmaniases are a diverse group of diseases caused by intracellular protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania. visceral leishmaniasis  is one of the “neglected tropical diseases” that impacts the most resource-poor regions of the world. active vl, caused by l. donovani, is characterized by a progressive increase in visceral parasite burden, cachexia, massive splenomegaly, pancytopenia and ultimately death. there are significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular and cellular determinants underlying the pathogenesis of vl. the syrian hamster  affords a unique opportunity to address these gaps because the clinicopathological features of vl in the hamster closely mimic active human disease. in recent reports  <cit>  we demonstrated that despite mounting a vigorous type  <dig> cellular immune response, an immunological event that is associated with control of infection in mice, the hamster develops a progressive, lethal disease. this paradoxical finding was reminiscent of the findings in humans  <cit> . furthermore, we found that the inability of l. donovani infected hamsters to control parasite replication was related to ineffective ifn-γ-mediated classical macrophage activation, evident by reduced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase  and production of nitric oxide , which is the primary mechanism by which mice control leishmania infection  <cit> . we found that parasitized macrophages were not deactivated but showed a m <dig>  phenotype where the expression of host arginase  <dig>  dominated at the site of infection  <cit> . although it is a well-established paradigm that m <dig> macrophages are driven by th <dig> cytokines, we discovered that l. donovani infection of macrophages and fibroblasts induced the expression of arg <dig> through an il-4-independent, but stat <dig> dependent, mechanism  <cit> . furthermore, the activation of stat <dig> and expression of arg <dig> enhanced intracellular parasite replication  <cit> . to better define the splenic environment that leads to a failure of host defense, we investigated the splenic response to l. donovani infection in the hamster model of progressive vl by use of a custom cdna microarray. we show that following a relatively silent early phase of infection there is dramatic upregulation of inflammatory and immune-related genes in the spleen that is coincident with the exponential increase in parasite replication  <cit> . the gene expression profiling identified a mixed cytokine response of ifn-γ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> with corresponding expression of a large number of cytokine-responsive genes in vl.

RESULTS
hamster cdna sequence assembly, characterization, and annotation
as noted above there are a number of experimental infection models in syrian hamsters that are relevant to human disease . however, there is limited availability of molecular tools for studies of disease pathogenesis in this model. a draft genome of mesocricetus auratus determined via genome shotgun sequencing has been reported , but it was incompletely annotated at the time when the data presented here were being analyzed. as an initial approach to address this obstacle we sequenced a syrian hamster cdna library constructed from a pool of mrna that had been isolated from 1) spleen, ln cells, and peritoneal macrophages exposed to various stimuli, and 2) normal tissue or tissue harvested from hamsters infected in vivo with several different pathogens. we chose to use cells and tissues that had been exposed to a broad range of stimuli and pathogens  in order to enrich for a diverse set of mrnas involved in immune responses. from the cdna library  <dig>  independent clones were sequenced to obtain  <dig> unique expressed sequence tags . datasets representing all sequences were assembled into contigs of overlapping sequences using phred  and phrap , and were compared to the non-redundant nucleotide database using the blast algorithm  <cit> . sequences that had a significant match with a mouse, rat, or human sequence were considered syrian hamster orthologs of the closest match. the breakdown of closest match by non-hamster species is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  hamster cdnas had the highest level of homology with mouse  and rat  sequences;  <dig> % did not have a significant match to the genbank database. only  <dig> % of sequences showed the highest homology to human or non-human primate dna and  <dig> % of sequences matched to non-mammalian species and were likely of pathogen origin since rna from the protozoa, helminthes, or viruses in the infected tissue would have been included in the rna used to construct the library .

analysis of splenic gene expression by microarray
the immunopathogenic mechanisms that contribute to visceral leishmaniasis  are not clearly understood. in a model of progressive vl  <cit>  we investigated splenic gene expression over the course of infection using a first generation cdna custom microarray.  <dig> unique ests from the cdna library, and an additional  <dig> cdnas that we had cloned independently  were amplified and spotted in duplicate onto a microarray making a total of  <dig> unique cdnas plus replicates of several housekeeping genes. we used the microarray to define the expression of splenic mrnas in response to visceral l. donovani infection at  <dig>   <dig>  and 28 days post-infection.

using partek gs, a principal component analysis  was performed to identify major effects influencing the expression values at each time point  <cit> . this is an exploratory global data analysis of the genome and not an analysis of any gene in particular. it was used for quality control of the data on all the samples . in general, samples that map closely are similar across the whole genome, whereas samples that map distantly are dissimilar across the whole genome  <cit> . a distinct clustering between uninfected and infected groups was clearly identified, showing that the infection status, and not a batch effect due to cy <dig> or cy <dig> labelling or the file  had the largest effect on the data at all time points. also no outliers were identified; dye-swap arrays  from pooled samples clustered within the correspondent infection status . thus, infection status had the major impact on differential gene expression in the spleens.figure  <dig>

after curation of the differentially expressed est, the lists were reduced to identifiable differentially expressed hamster genes. we demonstrated previously that in the hamster model of vl there is an initial period of silent infection, with little activation of the immune response, followed by a sharp increase in spleen size, number of macrophages, and splenic parasite burden  <cit> . the gene expression data presented here corroborated this previous observation at a much broader transcriptomic level , but it must be recognized that minor changes in gene expression may not be detected by microarray. when ests that had at least a 2-fold change in the mean expression between the uninfected and infected groups  and a false discovery rate  of <5% were considered to be differentially expressed,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at  <dig> and 14 days post-infection, respectively, but  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at 28 days post-infection . at this latter time point we demonstrated previously that there was a dramatic increase in parasite burden and accumulation of cells, especially macrophages, in the spleen  <cit> . when at least a 2-fold change and a p value < <dig>  was used as the threshold for significance the number of differentially expressed genes was higher. in the analysis of the data presented here we used a >2-fold change and fdr <5% to define the set of differentially expressed genes.table  <dig>

as shown in the volcano plots in figure  <dig>  most genes in the infected groups were expressed at less than a  <dig> -fold increase or decrease over the age-matched uninfected control group. however, at each of the time points there was cluster of highly upregulated mrnas, which increased over the course of infection such that at 28-days post-infection there were  <dig> mrnas with a fold-increase of > <dig> . only a small number mrnas  were down-regulated at 28-days post-infection. this is contrary to the previously held view, derived from microarray data from in vitro infected mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit>  macrophages, that leishmania infection had a broadly silent or suppressive rather than stimulatory effect on host transcription. however, these studies would not have included the multiple different cell populations and a myriad of inflammatory signals present in the whole infected spleen tissue. it should also be noted that the cdna library from which the microarray was created included rna isolated from leishmania-infected hamsters so it is likely that the microarray was enriched for genes that were upregulated in that infection model. the number of down-regulated genes was therefore probably underestimated. comparable transcriptome profiling has not been reported for the spleens of l. donovani infected mice or humans.

as noted earlier, leishmania dna may have been included in the microarray and/or leishmania rna could have cross-hybridized with an orthologous hamster est. to minimize the possibility that leishmania orthologs could confound the interpretation of the data, differentially expressed genes were ignored if the est was obviously derived from a pathogen . the possibility of a leishmania rna cross-hybridizing to the hamster ortholog  cannot be excluded. for some ests assigning a gene symbol was challenging. a case in point is bbs <dig>  in which there is a leishmania ortholog of the mammalian gene  <cit> . this est was identified as the most highly upregulated gene in the 28-day infected hamster spleen . it showed homology to the 3′ end of the mouse bbs <dig> sequence , but did not have sequence homology to the incompletely annotated hamster  genome or to the published leishmania sequence. using qrt-pcr and specific primers there was no increase in the transcript of the published hamster bbs <dig> but a substantial increase in the leishmania bbs <dig> ortholog . therefore, the leishmania bbs <dig> ortholog was highly expressed in the spleen during infection, the est labeled as bbs <dig> based on homology to the mouse sequence was upregulated, but this differentially expressed gene was not identical to the published hamster bbs <dig> sequence. other similar examples may exist, but these would primarily concern housekeeping/metabolic genes so would not affect the interpretation of the immunological findings of this study.

hierarchical clustering using euclidean distance and average linkage was applied to the differentially expressed genes at 28 days post-infection. the heatmap and dendrogram of the samples showed a pattern consistent with the pca, where arrays grouped under two major categories regardless of the labeling dye . the clustering of genes based on the similarity of their expression patterns suggests, but does not prove, that they have a similar biological function  <cit> . in general, all genes clustered into two expression groups, infected and uninfected. because of the high number  of differentially expressed genes at 28-day infection, a gene ontology -enrichment analysis  <cit>  using partek gs was made to better understand their putative biological function . high enrichment scores were detected for a number of biological functions that involved immune and inflammatory responses. this was not unexpected, since the cdna library was designed to be enriched for immune-related genes. identification of the genes included in the immune response and inflammatory response functions and their fold-increase is shown in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

analysis of the differentially expressed genes by the “web-based gene set analysis toolkit”  <cit>  and wikipathways  <cit>  revealed a number of pathways that were significantly upregulated by infection . these analyses were no doubt limited by the incomplete representation of the hamster transcriptome in the custom microarray. nevertheless, the transcripts that were differentially regulated at day- <dig> p.i. represented a broad array of genes involved in inflammation, immunity, immune cell trafficking, and metabolism. of particular interest were the pathways involved in t cell subset polarization and effector function. the enrichment ratio  was significantly increased for the type ii interferon   and il- <dig> signaling pathways  in the infected animals. because the custom microarray did not likely include all members of a pathway the numerator of the er is probably artificially low. the denominator is set independent of the microarray , so the calculated enrichment ratio is likely to be an underestimate of the true significance.table  <dig>

ifn-γ potently conveys antimicrobial properties to macrophages by inducing the transcription of a broad repertoire of genes  <cit> . in murine models of leishmania infection, ifn-γ, produced primarily by cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, is critical to the control of infection . paradoxically, in the hamster model of progressive vl  <cit> , as well as in humans with active vl  <cit> , there are high levels of ifn-γ expression without effective control of infection. indeed, in the microarray analysis, ifn-γ was the second most highly differentially expressed transcript  at 28-days post-infection , a time point in the course of infection when there is a massive increase in splenic parasite burden  <cit> . the reason why ifn-γ  effectively controls the parasite burden over time in mice but not in hamsters is not fully understood. furthermore, we found evidence of upregulation of a number of known interferon-responsive genes . in independent experiments we verified the microarray results by confirming the increased expression of a subset of these ifn-induced transcripts  in the spleens of 28-day infected hamsters by qrt-pcr . notably, and consistent with our previous work, we found minimal increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase  <dig>  expression, which is the primary effector mechanism for macrophage-mediated killing of intracellular leishmania in mice  <cit> . we previously identified sequences in the hamster nos <dig> promoter that rendered it less responsive to classical activating stimuli  <cit> . however, the transcriptional profiling presented here revealed an additional mechanism by which nos <dig> may be suppressed in macrophages. the high level of expression of the transcription factor irf <dig> , which is synergistically induced by ifn-γ and il- <dig>  <cit> , may compete with irf- <dig> to repress the transactivation of nos <dig> and other ifn-inducible genes  <cit> . this possible mechanism of impaired nos <dig> expression remains to be explored.figure  <dig>

the potential roles of other ifn-γ-responsive genes in the defense against leishmania are incompletely understood. the expression of indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase- <dig>  and tryptophan  <dig> -dioxygenase , which can limit pathogen replication by local depletion of tryptophan , was significantly increased in the spleens of infected animals . however, consistent with our results, recent work determined that the expression of ido <dig> may suppress both innate and adaptive anti-leishmanial immune responses  <cit>  and ido- <dig> is a marker of disease activity in human vl  <cit> . the expression of cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  which signal through the cxcr <dig> receptor, was greatly increased in the spleens of hamsters with vl   and they were elevated in the serum of patients with vl  <cit> . their role in defense against vl is uncertain. in l. major infected mice cxcr <dig> was required for resolution of infection through recruitment of effector t cells to the site of infection  <cit> . in l. donovani infected mice, however, cxcr <dig> was not required for development of a th <dig> response and control of hepatic infection  <cit> . a number of transcripts from the family of ifn-inducible gtpases  were increased in the spleen of hamsters with vl . this family of proteins includes the immunity-related gtpases  and p <dig> guanylate binding proteins  that promote resistance against intracellular bacterial, viral and protozoal pathogens . targeted disruption of some, but not all, of these genes in mice enhanced susceptibility to dermatropic leishmania strains  <cit>  but the role of this family in l. donovani infection is unknown. our data indicate that their expression does not preclude the progression of vl. collectively, these data reinforce the notion that progressive vl is not driven by the absence of ifn-γ production or a global deficit in ifn-γ responsiveness, but that other factors lead to unresponsive macrophage effector function.

the type  <dig> cytokines, interleukin - <dig> and il- <dig>  are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of experimental vl. il- <dig> expression was increased  <dig> -fold in the spleens of 28-day infected compared to uninfected hamsters , confirming our previous findings  <cit> . il- <dig> was increased  <dig> -fold, however, it did not meet the fdr criteria for a differentially expressed gene. by quantitative rt-pcr we recently determined that its expression was increased in the spleen of hamsters with vl  <cit> . il- <dig> and il- <dig> signal through pathways that have considerable overlap: the il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptors share the il-4rα chain and activation of the stat <dig> transcription factor is central to their canonical pathways . the action of il- <dig>  and to a lesser extent il- <dig>  plays a prominent role in the immunopathogenesis of murine l. major infection . however, in mice infected with l. donovani, where parasite replication is ultimately controlled and the animals do not develop progressive disease, il- <dig> and il- <dig> do not contribute to host susceptibility  <cit> . in fact, il- <dig> promotes the formation of hepatic granulomas and control of murine l. donovani infection  <cit> . the significance of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in human vl has not been fully addressed. il- <dig> is increased in the spleens  <cit>  and il <dig> and il- <dig> are increased in the plasma or serum  of patients with active vl. our previous work in the hamster model of progressive vl identified stat6-dependent, il-4-amplifying m2-like macrophage polarization as a critical determinant of progressive disease  <cit> . the microarray data presented here revealed that a number of il-4/il-13-responsive genes were upregulated during infection , including genes that are characteristic of alternatively activated  macrophages. the increased expression of arginase  <dig>  cc chemokine ligand  <dig> , ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> was confirmed by real time rt-pcr . an m2b-like phenotype of macrophages  was also reported in mice infected with l. infantum, a closely related visceralizing species  <cit> .figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
first generation microarray analysis of gene expression in the spleens of hamsters with progressive vl demonstrated a large number of highly upregulated genes. while the microarray provided only partial coverage of the hamster transcriptome, transcripts that were part of the ifn-γ and il-4/il- <dig> signaling pathways were prominently expressed. a robust and functional ifn-γ response is clearly evident by the expression of multiple downstream target genes, but this response does not restrain parasite replication. this finding supports the accumulating evidence that macrophages are ineffectively activated to kill the parasite in the spleens of progressive vl. the concomitant expression of il-4/il- <dig> and il- <dig>  with the increased expression of genes characteristic of m <dig> macrophage activation, are likely to contribute to this. the fundamental mechanism through which the high level of ifn-γ expression is unable to suppress type  <dig> cytokine response and mediate classical macrophage activation remains a mystery. further dissection of the regulatory mechanisms that lead to polarization of macrophages toward a permissive state is needed to fully understand the pathogenesis of vl.
