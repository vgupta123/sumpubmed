BACKGROUND
cadherins are calcium-dependent transmembrane proteins. they play important roles in cell adhesion, which is crucial for establishing and maintaining tissue architecture and function  <cit> . around  <dig> cadherin proteins have been identified, which can be divided into different subgroups, including classic cadherins, desmogleins, desmocollins, protocadherins, cnrs, fats, seven-pass transmembrane cadherins, and ret tyrosine kinase  <cit> . all cadherins have extracellular cadherin  repeats, the extracellular ca2+-binding domains that mediate cell-cell adhesion, but their cytoplasmic domains are diverse. classic cadherins  have a β-catenin-binding motif in their cytoplasmic domain, which is important for the cell adhesion function  <cit> .

the atypical cadherin protein cadherin  <dig>  is closely related to the fat subgroup, which is characterized by a large number of ec repeats , a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. although it bears no homology with classical cadherins except for the ec repeats, cadherin  <dig> can mediate cell-cell adhesion when over-expressed in l cells  <cit> . the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin  <dig> lacks the β-catenin-binding motif, suggesting that it may not be able to interact with β-catenin directly. however, recently cadherin  <dig> was shown to bind to the pdz <dig> domain of a scaffolding protein, magi- <dig>  <cit> , which in turn can bind to β-catenin via its pdz <dig> domain  <cit> , suggesting that magi- <dig> may act as a bridge between cadherin  <dig> and β-catenin.

the cdh <dig> gene gives rise to different transcripts through two mechanisms. the first mechanism utilizes different promoters, giving rise to proteins with different numbers of ec repeats  <cit> . the second type involves the alternative splicing of exon  <dig>  which encodes part of the cytoplasmic domain of the cadherin  <dig> isoform that is preferentially expressed in the inner ear  <cit> . it has been shown that the longest cadherin  <dig> variant with  <dig> ec repeats is a part of the tip-links in hair cell stereocilia  <cit> , which are the mechanical links that are essential for gating of the mechanoelectrical transduction channels. mutations of cdh <dig> gene have been identified to associate with blindness and hearing loss  <cit> .

several cadherin 23-binding proteins have been reported, including harmonin  <cit> , myosin 1c  <cit> , and protocadherin  <dig>  <cit> , all of which have been shown to be involved in hearing transduction and/or retinal function. as we learn more and more about the function of cadherin  <dig>  our knowledge about its genesis is limited. understanding how cadherin  <dig> is being shuttled to the apical hair cells membrane for example, and ultimately, how tip links are being assembled is crucial for shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of hair cell mechanosensation. recently, ehd <dig>  a eh domain-containing protein involved in endocytic recycling was identified as a novel cadherin 23-binding partner, and was suggested to play a role in regulating the membrane localization of cadherin  <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism responsible for the transport of cadherin  <dig> to the plasma membrane remains unclear.

we have conducted yeast two-hybrid screens of a cochlear cdna library using the cadherin  <dig> intracellular domain as a bait, and identified magi- <dig>  a maguk protein containing multiple pdz domains, as a novel cadherin 23-interaction partner  <cit> . here we report another pdz domain-containing protein identified from the screen, pist . pist was first reported as a putative binding protein of the rho protein tc <dig>  which is reflected in its name pist: pdz domain protein interacting specifically with tc <dig>  <cit> . as a golgi-associated protein, pist has been shown to interact with some transmembrane proteins and regulate the intracellular sorting and plasma membrane expression of these proteins  <cit> .

here we showed that pist and cadherin  <dig> interact via the pdz domain of pist and the cytoplasmic pdz-binding interface  of cadherin  <dig>  respectively. when co-expressed in cultured cells, pist retained cadherin  <dig> in trans-golgi networks . magi- <dig> and harmonin, two known cadherin 23-binding proteins that are expressed in hair cells were able to compete with pist and to release cadherin  <dig> from its retention. immunostaining showed that pist is expressed in inner ear hair cells. our results suggest that pist, magi- <dig> and harmonin regulate the intracellular sorting of cadherin  <dig>  thereby affecting the membrane localization of cadherin  <dig> 

methods
yeast two-hybrid screen
the yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as described before  <cit> . briefly, a chicken basilar papilla cdna library  <cit>  was screened using the carboxyl-terminal  <dig> amino acids  of chicken cadherin  <dig> as a bait.  <dig> ×  <dig> total transformants were selectively screened using his <dig>  as the primary reporter gene, then two more reporter genes ade <dig> and lacz were used to verify the positive colonies. the prey vectors in triple-positive yeast colonies were recovered and cdna inserts were sequenced.

expression vectors
mouse cdh <dig> cdna is a gift from k. noben-trauth , which consists of cdh <dig> cdna encoding the first three extracellular cadherin  repeats  fused to cdna encoding the protein's carboxyl-terminus , 2975-3319aa in cadherin 23) including the transmembrane domain. for protein manipulation, we added his and c-myc tags between the signal peptide and the first ec repeat. the cdna encoding cadherin  <dig> lacking the last  <dig> aa  at the carboxyl-terminus was pcr amplified and cloned into pcdna <dig>  to generate expression vectors for myc-cadherin  <dig> . human ha-pist cdna is a gift from dr. w. b. guggino . pist cdna was pcr amplified and cloned into pegfp-c <dig> to express full length pist, pist cc2-plus domain , and pist pdz domain  as egfp fusion proteins. mouse magi-1c cdna is a gift from k. m. patrie , and was pcr-amplified and cloned into pegfp-c <dig> for the expression of egfp-magi-1c protein. mouse harmonin cdna was pcr-amplified from mouse organ of corti cdna and cloned into pegfp-c <dig> for the expression of egfp-harmonin protein.

co-immunoprecipitation
hek <dig> cells were transfected with the expression vectors using genejammer transfection reagent . transfected cells were washed with pbs 24- <dig> hours after transfection and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm tris at ph  <dig> , 1%  triton x- <dig>   <dig> mm pmsf, and  <dig> × protease inhibitor cocktail . for immunoprecipitation, we used immobilized monoclonal anti-c-myc agarose beads  and performed the experiments according to the manufacturer's recommendation. following  <dig> hours of incubation at 4°c, immunoprecipitated proteins were washed five times with washing buffer , separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. the proteins were probed with corresponding antibodies and detected with an odyssey infrared imaging system .

immunocytochemistry
all steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. transfected cells  growing on gelatin-coated glass cover slips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde  in phosphate-buffered saline  for  <dig> minutes, then permeabilized and blocked with pbt <dig>  for  <dig> minutes, followed by incubation with mouse anti-myc antibody 9e <dig>  and/or rabbit anti-pist antibody ), 1: <dig> diluted in pbt <dig>  over night at 4°c. in other experiments, polyclonal rabbit antibody against cadherin  <dig> ) and monoclonal mouse antibody against golgin- <dig> , 1: <dig> diluted in pbt <dig>  were used to label cadherin  <dig> and trans-golgi network marker golgin- <dig>  after washing twice with pbt <dig> for  <dig> minutes and twice with pbt <dig>  for  <dig> minutes, cells were incubated with  <dig>  μg/ml fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody  in pbt <dig> for  <dig> hour, followed by two  <dig> minutes pbt <dig> washes and two  <dig> minutes pbs washes. for nuclei staining, cells were then incubated with toto- <dig> , 1: <dig>  diluted in pbs for  <dig> hour, followed by three  <dig> minutes pbs washes, then mounted in glycerol/pbs . immunostaining was imaged with a confocal microscope .

tissue section staining
all animal procedures followed guidelines set forth by the national institutes of health. the cochleae were dissected from p <dig> and adult  c <dig> mice, immediately fixed in 4% pfa for  <dig> hours, then immersed in 30% sucrose solution overnight and embedded in o.c.t. compound . blocks were then frozen at -20°c and sectioned at  <dig> μm thickness onto slide glasses with cryostat . staining was performed as described above. briefly, sectioned tissues were incubated with rabbit anti-pist antibody  and guinea pig anti-myosin viia antibody   <cit> , then  <dig>  μg/ml fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody . after the final wash with pbs, tissues were stained with tritc-conjugated phalloidin  to visualize f-actin in the hair bundles of hair cells and dapi  to visualize nuclei. the slides were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and digital image acquisition .

RESULTS
pist's interaction with cadherin  <dig> is pdz mediated
to identify proteins that interact with cadherin  <dig>  we performed yeast two-hybrid screens of a chicken basilar papilla cdna library using the intracellular part of chicken cadherin  <dig> protein as a bait . proteins identified through the yeast two-hybrid screen include scaffolding proteins  and chaperones , most but not all of which are pdz domain-containing proteins. twenty-nine clones, which account for more than half of all the isolated positive clones, encode the chicken pdz-containing, golgi-associated chaperone protein pist. the isolated  <dig> pist clones fall into  <dig> groups of unique cdnas, covering different lengths of pist's amino acid sequence . the longest clone encodes nearly the full-length chicken pist, only missing the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids comparing to the predicted chicken pist sequence in ncbi database, and the shortest contains the second coiled-coil domain and the pdz domain.

to verify the interaction biochemically, we performed co-immunoprecipitation  experiments. both proteins are highly conserved among different species. mammalian cadherin  <dig> and pist share about 90% homology with their chicken counterparts. comparing to the predicted chicken pist protein, mammalian pist misses about  <dig> aa at the n-terminus . there are no predicable domains in this region. mammalian hair cells are becoming more and more the main focus of research, which prompted us to focus the rest of the investigation on mammalian proteins. the full-length cdh <dig> cdna is more than  <dig> kb long and difficult to manipulate, so instead of using the full-length cdna, we made a construct that expresses a myc-tagged cadherin  <dig> protein missing ec4- <dig> . when over-expressed in hek <dig> cells, egfp-tagged human pist was co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged mouse cadherin  <dig>  and this interaction was not affected by the splicing of exon  <dig> . co-ip experiments with egfp-tagged pist coiled-coil domain  <dig>  plus the amino acids between cc <dig> and the pdz domain  or the pdz domain  revealed that both domains were co-iped with myc-cadherin  <dig> . the interaction between pist's pdz domain and cadherin  <dig> was not affected by the splicing of exon  <dig>  while the interaction between pist cc2-plus and cadherin  <dig> was isoform-dependent, with the cadherin  <dig> interaction being much stronger than cadherin  <dig>  the interaction between pist cc2-plus and cadherin  <dig> was barely detectable.

the last  <dig> amino acids  at cadherin 23's carboxyl-terminus constitute a class-i pdz domain binding interface , which is important for the interaction of cadherin  <dig> with two other pdz domain containing proteins, harmonin and magi- <dig>  <cit> . we then tested whether these  <dig> amino acids are also important for the association of cadherin  <dig> with pist. we found that cadherin  <dig> lacking the last  <dig> amino acids ) displayed decreased binding ability to pist when compared to intact cadherin  <dig> . although the removal of binding could be the consequence of misfolding of the truncated protein, our data as well as other published results suggested that the principal interaction between the two proteins utilizes the pdz binding interface.

pist retains cadherin  <dig> in the trans-golgi network
it has been shown that pist can regulate the subcellular localization of its interacting partners. to test whether this also applies to cadherin  <dig>  we analyzed the subcellular distribution of pist and cadherin  <dig> in transfected hek <dig> cells by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. myc-cadherin  <dig> was found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the plasma membrane . the association with the plasma membrane was clearly visible when we stained for the extracellular myc epitope of myc-cadherin  <dig> without permeabilizing the cells . the myc epitope is placed in the extracellular part of cadherin  <dig>  so when a non-permeable protocol is used, only the plasma membrane cadherin  <dig> can be visualized. when co-expressed with egfp-pist, however, myc-cadherin  <dig> was found to co-localize with egfp-pist , which exhibited a tgn-like staining pattern, and the plasma membrane expression of cadherin  <dig> was dramatically reduced to an undetectable level . to make sure that the reduced membrane expression of myc-cadherin  <dig> in figure 4b is not caused by unsuccessful transfection, we used a construct that expresses myc-cadherin  <dig> and mcherry at the same time , so when mcherry is detected in a cell, myc-cadherin  <dig> is expressed in the same cell. when we disrupted the interaction between these two proteins by removing the last  <dig> amino acids of cadherin  <dig>  the subcellular localization of cadherin  <dig> was not affected by egfp-pist any more .

the retention of cadherin  <dig> by pist was also observed in transfected cho and cos- <dig> cells . pist has been shown to associate with trans-golgi network  in mammalian cells  <cit> . to explore whether pist retains cadherin  <dig> in tgn, we stained transfected cells with an antibody against a tgn maker, glogin- <dig>  when cotransfected in cos- <dig> cells, myc-cadherin  <dig> co-localized with egfp-pist, as well as golgin- <dig> . our data suggests that by binding to cadherin  <dig>  pist retains cadherin  <dig> in tgn, hence reduces its membrane expression.

magi- <dig> and harmonin compete with pist, and release cadherin  <dig> from trans-golgi network retention
magi- <dig>  harmonin, and pist can independently interact with cadherin  <dig> via a pdz domain-mediated mechanism  <cit> . given the fact that they all bind to the same binding site at the carboxyl-terminus of cadherin  <dig>   <cit> ), a single cadherin  <dig> protein might only be able to bind to either pist, or magi- <dig>  or harmonin. we consequently explored whether magi- <dig> or harmonin compete with pist for binding cadherin  <dig>  and furthermore, whether they are able to release cadherin  <dig> from the pist-mediated trans-golgi network retention. egfp-magi- <dig> exists as protein aggregates in the cytoplasm when overexpressed in hek <dig> cells . when we co-expressed myc-cadherin  <dig> and ha-pist in presence of egfp-magi- <dig>  myc-cadherin  <dig>  co-localized with egfp-magi- <dig> in the cytoplasm, and was no longer associated with ha-pist in the trans-golgi network . this suggests that magi- <dig> is able to competitively displace pist from binding to cadherin  <dig>  and that this competition releases the retention of cadherin  <dig> in the trans-golgi network.

the interaction between harmonin and cadherin  <dig> is more complex, involving multiple binding sites. the pdz <dig> domain of harmonin binds weakly to cadherin 23's carboxyl-terminus. a second interaction happens between the region immediately upstream of harmonin's pdz <dig> domain and an internal peptide of cadherin 23's intracellular domain  <cit> . the amino acids encoded by exon  <dig> are adjacent to this binding site in cadherin  <dig> and may affect the binding to harmonin, since it has been shown that harmonin binds to cadherin  <dig> much more robustly than to cadherin  <dig>  <cit> . this preferential splice variant-dependent binding was functionally confirmed in our subcellular localization assays. when myc-cadherin  <dig> and ha-pist were co-expressed in hek <dig> cells in presence of egfp-harmonin, myc-cadherin  <dig> co-localized with egfp-harmonin, which was associated with filamentous structures in the cytoplasm as described before  <cit> , but not in trans-golgi networks where ha-pist localizes . conversely, when myc-cadherin  <dig> and ha-pist were co-expressed in hek <dig> cells in presence of egfp-harmonin, myc-cadherin  <dig> displayed a mixed localization, partially colocalized with egfp-harmonin in the cytoplasm, as well as partially colocalized with ha-pist in the trans-golgi network, which is consistent with a weaker binding ability of cadherin  <dig> to harmonin .

pist protein is expressed by all types of hair cells
cadherin  <dig> expression is restricted to a few cell types; cadherin  <dig> especially has only been detected in inner ear sensory hair cells so far  <cit> . if pist functionally interacts with cadherin  <dig>  we would expect it to be expressed in these cell types. we used affinity-purified antibodies to examine the expression pattern of pist in the mouse inner ear. in the cochlea of postnatal day  <dig>  mice, pist immunoreactivity was detectable in inner and outer hair cells as well as supporting cells, including pillar cells and deiter's cells . also in the five vestibular organs , pist immunoreactivity was confined to the sensory epithelia, where it labeled hair cells and probably also supporting cells . in the adult mouse cochlea, pist shows a similar expression pattern .

discussion
our findings support the hypothesis that the golgi-associated, pdz domain-containing protein pist, in conjunction with two other pdz domain-containing proteins magi- <dig> and harmonin, plays roles in trafficking cadherin  <dig> to different subcellular locations. it has been shown that pist interacts with some membrane proteins, and regulates the intracellular trafficking and localization of these membrane proteins: over-expression of pist leads to a dramatic decrease in the plasma membrane expression of cftr  <cit> , clc- <dig> chloride channels  <cit> , the β <dig> adrenergic receptor  <cit> , and the somatostatin receptor subtype  <dig>  <cit> . here we show that over-expression of pist retains cadherin  <dig> in the trans-golgi network and decreases the plasma membrane expression of cadherin  <dig>  suggesting that it is able to regulate the intracellular localization and/or sorting of cadherin  <dig>  this regulation requires the c-terminal pdz domain-binding interface  of cadherin  <dig> 

interestingly, we found that besides the pdz domain, the cc <dig> domain and its downstream amino acids  also interacts with cadherin  <dig> in an isoform-dependent way. nevertheless, this binding site does not appear to mediate the principal interaction between these two proteins because interference of the pdz/pbi-mediated interaction between pist and cadherin  <dig> abolishes the interaction of these two proteins nearly completely.

we also found that the other two cadherin 23-binding, pdz domain-containing proteins, magi- <dig> and harmonin, can compete with pist in cellular assays, resulting in release of cadherin  <dig> from trans-golgi networks. consistent with its equal binding strength to cadherin  <dig> and cadherin  <dig>  magi- <dig> can release both cadherin  <dig> isoforms from pist's retention. on the other hand, harmonin has a lower binding ability to cadherin  <dig> when compared to cadherin  <dig>  hence although it releases cadherin  <dig> efficiently, it only partially releases cadherin  <dig> from pist's retention.

we used hek <dig> cells as a model to study the competitions among these pdz domain-containing proteins for binding cadherin  <dig>  in polarized cells such as hair cells, both magi- <dig> and harmonin have been shown to associate with the plasma membrane and hair cell stereocilia  <cit> . in our study, over-expressed magi- <dig> and harmonin are not targeted to the membrane; instead, they showed cytoplasmic localization and aggregation. this mislocalization is likely the result of overexpression in a cell line. in addition, other unknown factors that are potentially present in hair cells might contribute to the membrane localization of magi- <dig> and harmonin. nevertheless, our data provide the first clues on posttranslational targeting of cadherin  <dig> through the trans-golgi network to other places inside the cell. we hypothesize that pist in hair cells can transiently interact with cadherin  <dig> and retain cadherin  <dig> in the trans-golgi networks, and that this retention is released by either magi- <dig> or harmonin. we speculate that magi-1/cadherin  <dig> or harmonin/cadherin  <dig> are targeted together to the apical hair cell plasma membrane.

cadherin  <dig> has a limited expression profile, only detected in some cell types. cadherin  <dig>  which is suggested to be the hair cell tip-link component, is only reported in hair cells so far  <cit> . in mouse inner ear, pist expression was restricted to hair cells and supporting cells, both in the auditory and vestibular systems. this places all four proteins, cadherin  <dig>  pist, harmonin, and magi- <dig> into hair cells. it has been shown that in hair cells, cadherin  <dig> is detected on the stereocilia, and not detectable in the trans-golgi network, but it is very clear the native cadherin  <dig> needs to pass through the tgn  on its way to the apical hair cell plasma membrane. our data suggests that pist may play an important role in regulating the intracellular sorting/localization of cadherin  <dig>  pist, harmonin, and magi- <dig>  the three cadherin 23-binding, pdz domain-containing proteins, may work together, perhaps sequentially, to regulate cadherin 23's transport to the plasma membrane.

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggests a possible regulatory mechanism responsible for the transport of cadherin  <dig> to the plasma membrane. we show that cadherin  <dig> interacts with pist, a golgi-associated, pdz domain-containing protein, which retains cadherin  <dig> in the trans-golgi network, and reduces the membrane expression of cadherin  <dig>  in this way pist plays a negative role in targeting cadherin  <dig> to the plasma membrane. we also show that magi- <dig> and harmonin can compete with pist for binding cadherin  <dig> and release cadherin  <dig> from pist's retention. taken together, pist, magi- <dig> and harmonin may collaborate in intracellular trafficking of cadherin  <dig> and regulate the plasma membrane expression of cadherin  <dig>
