BACKGROUND
copy number variations  distribute ubiquitously in the human genome  <cit>  and belong to the spectrum of genetic variation ranging from  <dig> base pairs to larger structural events  <cit> . as an important form of genetic variation complementary to single-nucleotide polymorphisms , cnvs have attracted extensive attentions and unprecedented successes have been achieved in detection of cnvs as well as segmental duplications  in the human genome . multiple studies indicated that cnvs have been associated with a variety of human diseases . together with snps, cnvs are becoming recognized as an important source of genetic variance  <cit>  and may account for some of the missing heritability for complex traits  <cit> .

benefitting from the achievements of pioneering cnv studies in humans, substantial progress has been made in the discovery and characterization of cnvs in livestock genomes. in the past few years, a significant amount of research on genome-wide cnv identification was conducted in various domestic animal species, including cattle  <cit> , dog , sheep  <cit> , goat  <cit> , chicken  <cit> , turkey  <cit>  and pig  <cit> . a suite of genes with copy number alteration were exploited contributing to variation of either mendelian phenotypes  or complex production traits  <cit> . based on these findings, it was expected that cnv studies could advance the studies of genetic diversity, evolution, functional genomics as well as genome assisted prediction.

however, a potential issue with majority of previous cnv studies in livestock species displayed as a lack of power and accuracy for cnv identification due to the technical limitations of two most frequently used detection platforms, i.e., snp chips and array comparative genome hybridization   <cit> . this obviously highlights the need to pursue more powerful and sensitive tools for construction of high resolution cnv map. to achieve this goal, bickhart et al.
 <cit>  performed cnv detections in individual cattle genomes using the next-generation sequencing  technique combined with mrfast/mrsfast and whole-genome shotgun sequence detection  analytical methods  <cit>  based on the findings of sd detection  <cit> . their work demonstrated that the ngs has superiority over snp chip and acgh in cnv deteciton in livestock genomes. besides the platforms employed in cnv detection, the other crucial factor determining the abundance of detected cnv is the experimental population investigated. findings from several studies  <cit>  indicated that a considerable proportion of cnvs likely segregate among distinct breeds, such that a sufficiently high-resolution cnv map would require the survey of multiple breeds/populations  <cit> .

in the past few years, much effort has been taken to detect cnvs in pig genome using three main genome-wide cnv identification technologies, i.e., acgh , snp genotyping array  and genome re-sequencing based on the next generation sequencing . however, compared to humans and other model organisms, relatively few studies have investigated cnvs in pigs and little is known about how cnvs contribute to normal phenotypic variation and to disease susceptibility in this species. since cnvs play a vital role in genomic studies, and pigs act as one of the most economically important livestock worldwide as well as popular model for various human diseases  <cit> , it is an imperative need to develop a comprehensive, more accurate and higher resolution porcine cnv map and in-depth characterize cnvs across pig genomes for follow-up cnv functional investigation. to achieve the aforementioned goal, we performed the current study to systematically exploit features of sds and cnvs present in the pig genome using high throughput ngs data of diverse pig breeds in the framework of the pig draft genome sequence   <cit> . we designed the studies considering the following two aspects:  cnvs mostly occurred with different probabilities among different populations; and  a number of chinese local breeds conferred much larger variability and higher average heterozygosity than european breeds  <cit> .

beyond the definition of cnvs, some cnvs may be fixed in the population and  can also be detected across the genome as sds  <cit>  which are generally defined as >1 kb stretches of duplicated dna with 90% or higher sequence identity  <cit> . it was also believed that an sd-rich region would generate more cnvs than other regions  <cit> , showing a close association with cnvs near or around it. considering the potential link between sds and cnvs across the genome, we employed the ngs data of genomes of experimental individuals as well as the reference genome of duroc 2– <dig> to construct individualized sd and cnv maps and in-depth characterize global cnvs via the commonly used analytical approaches, i.e., whole-genome assembly comparison  and whole-genome shotgun sequence detection   <cit> .

to pursue a reliable cnv map, in the present study, we employed individual genomes from multiple populations, including all six types of chinese indigenous breeds, one asian wild sow, as well as three commercial breeds. additionally, we have improved the original read depth  method in wssd analyses through adjusting the bias in cnv calling due to fragmented sequences in the process of hard masking of reference genome. this enhanced the detection power, lowered the false positive findings and increased copy number estimation accuracy, especially for ngs data with long sequencing reads. our work is of importance to researchers working with swine genomics and would lay a solid foundation for future cnv functional researches in the pig genome.

RESULTS
sequencing data set statistics
based on illumina hiseq  <dig>  we obtained ngs data of  <dig> pig individuals, which were selected to cover a broad representation of pig diversity of both modern commercial pigs and chinese domestic and wild pigs. the sequencing data set statistics have also been summarized in table  <dig>  the depth of coverage for each animal varied from  <dig> × to  <dig> ×, which is sufficient for genome-wide cnv detection using rd method according to the previous studies  <cit> .table  <dig>

sd map construction for the reference genome
using wgac, we initially detected a total of  <dig>  pairwise alignments with an aligned length of >1 kb and identity of >90%, which showed an excess of sd contents compared to previous results in other species  <cit> . after removal of high-copy repeats, the filtered detections consisted of  <dig>  pairwise alignments, of which  <dig>   involved unplaced scaffolds . furthermore,  <dig> %  of these alignments had an identity of >99% that may contain numerous artificial duplications due to local assembly errors  <cit> . the remaining alignments  had identities varying from 90% to 99%. the distribution profile of the identities for these  <dig>  alignments was presented in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  which showed an approximately uniform distribution within the interval of  <dig> - <dig>  while exhibiting a sharp increase in alignment frequency within the interval of  <dig> - <dig> . we further merged all of  <dig>  alignments into  <dig>  non-overlapping sequence intervals. the total length of these intervals reached  <dig>  mb, amounting to  <dig> % of the reference genome, which indicated an excessive content of duplicated bases. specially,  <dig>  of  <dig>  intervals were mapped to unplaced scaffolds, accounting for  <dig>  mb . among the  <dig>  unplaced scaffolds >1 kb in size,  <dig>   contained sd and  <dig>   had >70% of duplicated bases . the high content of sd in unplaced scaffolds was considered to be related to the difficulty in placing the scaffolds into the assembly  <cit> .

in wssd analyses, a total of  <dig>  unique intervals  were predicted as listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  similar to the strategy of bailey et al.
 <cit> , we further filtered the wgac alignments of ≥94% identity with sd calls by wssd to remove artifactual duplications. after filtering, the final wgac dataset consisted of  <dig>  pairwise alignments , out of which  <dig> were mapped to unplaced scaffolds, and five were mapped to pig mitochondrion. of the  <dig> chromosomes ,  <dig>  of  <dig>   pairwise alignments were intrachromosomal and most pairwise alignments were within the distance of 1 mb between each other . the profile of the sd map with wgac is presented in figure  <dig> and the features of sds across different chromosomes are also detailed in table  <dig>  which is similar to the duplication pattern of mouse  <cit> , dog  and cattle  <cit>  while quite different from the interspersed segmental duplication pattern that predominates in human  <cit> . previous studies  suggested that abundant interspersed segmental duplications may be specific for human and great apes genomes and play a vital role during the evolution of their gene families.figure  <dig>

 the number of pairwise alignments of sds varies from > <dig>  to < <dig> against different distance ranges.  the total aligned bases of pairwise alignments against different distances varies from >25 mb to <1 mb. the total aligned bases is simply the sum of aligned bases of all pairwise alignments within different distances, probably counting multiple times for some regions covered by different pairwise alignments.

sd distribution on different pig chromosomes


a

apairwise alignments were merged into non-overlapping intervals which are used for measurements of the length.

the final pig sd database was constructed through integrating low-identity wgac , filtered high-identity wgac  and the wssd estimates. overlapping segments by either wgac or wssd were simply merged into one single sd, the endpoints of which are outermost bases of the overlapping segments. excluding unplaced scaffolds and mitochondrion, the pig sd database contained  <dig>  intervals which totaled  <dig>  mb in size and  <dig> % of all the chromosomes  . the proportion of duplicated bases varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> % across different chromosomes as showed in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  compared to previous studies on other species  <cit> , the estimates of pig sd are relatively conservative. one possible reason may be due to exclusion of the unplaced scaffolds in our wssd analysis.

individualized cnv discovery
using our improved strategy, a total number of  <dig>  segmental duplication/deletion calls were predicted from all the  <dig> individuals after artifact removal. the number of cnv events varied across different pig individuals, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   with an average of  <dig>  per individual . the overall profile of these identified segmental duplications/deletions across the genome for each individual is illustrated in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  as well as detailed in additional file 3: table s <dig> table  <dig> 
summaries of sd/deletion calls of the  <dig> analyzed pigs on the number, total length and average length




accordingly, all detected cnv segments were further merged into  <dig>  unique cnvrs across all experimental animal genomes following the criteria that the union of overlapping cnvs across individuals are considered as a cnvr  <cit> . concerning copy number status, the numbers of gain, loss and both events  were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. gain events were more common than loss events in cnvrs, and had slightly larger sizes than losses on average . the cnvrs totaled  <dig>  mb in length with an average of  <dig>  kb, amounting to  <dig> % of the  <dig> chromosomes based on the porcine genome . the distribution and the status of these identified cnvrs are plotted in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  and a full list of cnvrs and corresponding features are provided in additional file 3: table s <dig>  we further summarized the numbers and the lengths of cnvrs on different chromosomes in additional file 3: table s <dig>  which illustrated non-uniform patterns across the genome. this is consistent with previous reports on heterogeneous distributions of cnvs in human and other species  <cit> .

figure  <dig> demonstrates the spectrum of sizes of all detected cnvrs across the genome. it shows that most cnvrs fell into the interval between 10 kb and 20 kb, and the frequency of cnvrs tends to decrease with the increase of the length. it is notable that in our rd analyses, cnvs were called using the criterion that at least  <dig> of  <dig> sequential long sliding windows showed rd values significantly deviating from the rd average; thus, cnvs >10 kb in length were kept in the final dataset. this indicates that our rd analyses are prone to detection of large structural variation events, and a significant amount of variation in length <10 kb would be precluded from the final findings. this filtering process is a routine strategy in recent similar studies  <cit>  to assure high confident positive findings in rd detection.figure  <dig> 
the spectrum of the sizes of all detected cnvrs.




we investigated further to see if potential population/breed specific cnvs exist. specifically, of the  <dig>  total cnvrs,  <dig>   were merely identified in a single breed/population, confirming that segregating cnvs exist across various breeds. additionally, out of the  <dig>  cnvrs,  <dig>  were called merely in the three modern commercial breeds, while  <dig>  cnvrs  were detected specific in the nine chinese indigenous pigs as well as the wild sow. these potential population/breed specific cnvrs can be considered as good candidates for determining breed-specific characteristics, although it is necessary to confirm phenotypic effects of these cnvs using more experimental samples. on the other hand, we scanned all cnvrs and merely found nine of them  ubiquitously existing in the same state among the  <dig> animals. except these nine potentially fixed sds/deletions, the states of other sds/deletions are variable across all  <dig> individuals. this clearly demonstrates cnvs are widely present in genomes across different population/breeds. we compared the length as well as the numbers of sds/deletions identified between each pair of individuals. as given in additional file 3: table s <dig> and s <dig>  the number of common intervals shared by the pairwise individuals ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  with the total overlapping length from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. this suggests that most cnvs occurred widely across the genomes of individuals.

quality assessment of cnvs by using acgh data and qpcr
using two complementary methods, acgh and qpcr, we performed experimental validation to confirm individual copy number variants.

one custom-designed  <dig>  m acgh  based on the sscrofa <dig>  porcine assembly was used to assess the cnvs by rd. in acgh hybridizations, the individual d <dig>  was used as the reference, while the other  <dig> individuals as the test samples. we employed a method initially proposed by alkan et al.  <cit>  to assess the rd called cnvs with acgh data using the individual d <dig>  as the reference sample. overall, the pearson’s correlation coefficient between variables, defined as the log <dig> value and the mean of probe log <dig> ratios varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  for each of the test animals, with an average of  <dig> % . the degrees of consistency of quality assessment herein are similar with those in human and cattle  <cit> . additionally, we found that the level of correlation coefficient for the cnvs validation is highly dependent on the copy number differences of cnv intervals between the reference sample and the test sample, i.e., the less difference of copy number, the lower the calculation of correlation coefficient. the trend of this dependence has also been clearly exemplified in figure  <dig>  this may be because the acgh data is not sensitive to detect small copy number difference between test sample and reference sample due to the impact of noise signals, especially in highly duplicated regions.figure  <dig> 
the correlation between rd estimates and experimental acgh results.
 for individual c <dig>  the log <dig> values of ratios of rd predicted copy numbers  were compared with probe log <dig> ratios from whole-genome acgh , showing a correlation of  <dig> ..  another sample, m <dig>  shows a correlation of  <dig> .  for individual c <dig> , cnv intervals were divided into three groups according to different level of copy number difference between c <dig> and the reference sample . every group of cnv intervals was used to calculate the correlation between rd estimates and experimental acgh results, respectively. it is clear that the higher the copy number difference of each interval, the larger the correlation between rd estimates and experimental acgh results.  for another individual , impact of copy number difference on the correlation shows similar trend with that in figure 3c.



in the qpcr confirmation, based on the copy numbers of every individual predicted by rd and qpcr method, we systematically assessed performance of the rd-called cnvs through three evaluation criteria in the process of validation, including the overall agreement rate of rd with qpcr results, the prediction power of rd and the positive prediction rate of rd. all the primers used and qpcr results are listed in additional file 4: table s <dig> and s <dig>  overall, the agreement rate, detection power and the positive prediction rate for the rd validation are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the result demonstrated that qpcr experiments agreed well with the prediction by rd method. the discrepancies between the qpcr and results identified by rd method may be caused by potential snps and small indels, which influence the hybridization of the qpcr primers in some individuals, resulting in unstable quantification values or lowering primer efficiency.

additionally, we performed qpcr validation for the cnv findings based on the original detection strategy within the same regions for comparing with those based on our improved strategy. the qpcr validation results showed that the corresponding agreement rate, detection power and the positive prediction value were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the comparison between the two different cnv calling strategies clearly showed the credible evidences on the advantage of the improved strategy proposed herein over the original.

comparison with previous studies
we also compared cnvrs in this study with previous pig cnv studies  <cit> . after merging the results of recent reports, a total of  <dig> out of  <dig>  cnvrs  with the length of  <dig>  mb in our study overlapped with those previously reported . this indicates about one-third of cnvrs identified in our study was validated by previous studies, and most are firstly detected herein. besides different algorithms for cnv calling, a difference between these ngs data-based cnv studies and the current study lies in that merely the current study employed sd information of the reference genome in the process of cnv detections, such that the short-read artifacts were removed from the detections in current study. additionally, compared with the study by rubin et al.  <cit> , the different point is that the current study is based on individualized sequencing while that of rubin et al. is based on sequencing of pooled samples. as a consequence the current study has a better power to detect cnvs with rare frequency, while the study of rubin et al. is prone to find common cnvs.table  <dig> 
comparison between cnvrs detected in the study with those in the previous reports


note: the comparison was based on sscrofa  <dig>  assembly . for cnvrs based on the other porcine assembly, we firstly converted the data to current genome coordinates using the ucsc liftover tool .



association of cnvrs with sd and other genomic features
it has been reported that cnvs may be facilitated by ancestral sds through the occurrence of non-allelic homologous recombination   <cit> , showing enrichment around ancestral sds. to further confirm if the similar cnv formation mechanism occurs in the swine genome, we picked out sds with <95% identity  that was postulated as the ancestral sds that happened at earliest ~ <dig> million years ago when sus scrofa just emerged in south east asia  <cit>  according to the traditional sequence divergence rate of 2% per million years  <cit> . these putative ancestral sds were then merged into non-overlapping regions that would be used in the enrichment analysis. simulation results clear demonstrated the strong statistical evidence  according to the empirical distribution, indicating that the cnvrs are significantly associated with ancestral sd regions of the reference genome.

furthermore, we also tested the correlation between cnv hotspots and ancestral sds. accordingly, we picked out  <dig> regions as cnv hotspots from  <dig>  putative cnv regions  using the criteria that at least two of the three commercial pigs and at least two of ten chinese pigs should be detected as having duplication/deletion within the cnvr . the simulation tests showed that  <dig>  ancestral sds overlapped with cnv hotspots while only  <dig> in random situation . the  <dig>  fold sd enrichment for cnv hotspots was much larger than the  <dig> -fold enrichment for all cnvrs, implying the special effect of ancestral sds on evolution of cnv hotspots  <cit> .

in addition, we explored if cnv breakpoints were enriched for gc-rich regions which were likely to show high rate of homologous recombination  <cit> . based on the criteria of berglund et al.
 <cit> , the breakpoints were defined by the cnvr boundaries covering a 2-kb length segment. accordingly, we found a significantly higher gc content in these locations  than that in the genomic background . as reported by berglund et al.
 <cit> , a gc-peak can be determined when a 500-bp sliding window centered in a 10 kb background sliding window has a  <dig> -fold increase in gc content, we searched for gc-peaks across the pig genome. after performing a randomization test, we found a  <dig> -fold gc-peaks enrichment in cnv breakpoints . besides previous reports in dogs  <cit> , the findings herein further confirmed the strong association between cnv and gc-peaks. however, the proportion of breakpoints within a 1-kb region of gc peak merely reached  <dig> % in present study, which is mainly due to the sparse distribution of gc peaks across the pig genome . this clues us the difference of cnv formation mechanisms among distinct species, and gc-peaks may be just one of potential cnv formation mechanisms of pig cnvs.

genomic effects of cnvs
to test the genomic effects of cnvs identified in the study, we compared the cnvrs identified in this study with the reported quantitative trait locus  regions collected in the pig qtl database  and human disease gene orthologs in online mendelian inheritance in man annotations . consequentially, some cnvrs were identified overlapping with a suite of pig qtls  and human disease gene orthologs , providing the evidence that cnvs may be associated with or affect animal health and production traits under recent selection. since some qtls have too large confidence interval, we focused on the  <dig>  qtls with confidence interval less than 5 mb. out of the  <dig>  qtls,  <dig>   overlapped with the cnvrs identified in this study, which are involved in a wide range of traits, such as growth, meat quality, reproduction, immune capacity and disease resistance. for the human disease gene orthologs, we found  <dig> cnvrs identified in the study overlapped  <dig> genes associated with human diseases, such as stiff skin syndrome, leukemia, polycythemia vera, autism, and complement factor h deficiency. this demonstrates that, in accordance with previous studies, cnvs play an important role in phenotypic variation and are often related with disease susceptibility  <cit> .

out of the  <dig>  porcine genes locating in the  <dig> chromosomes, a total of  <dig>  porcine genes  were completely or partially overlapped with cnvrs, including  <dig>  protein-coding genes,  <dig> pseudo genes,  <dig> trna genes,  <dig> miscrna genes and  <dig> genes with other types. it is notable that these genes are distributed merely in  <dig>  cnvrs  of all identified cnvrs, i.e., the remaining  <dig> % cnvrs do not contain any annotated genes. the distribution of genes among cnvrs from the present studies is similar with those in other studies  <cit> . to test if the genes are enriched in these cnvrs, an empirical distribution of genes among cnvrs were constructed through  <dig>  simulations. consequentially, we found that the genes trended to enrich within the cnvrs , especially for the protein-coding genes , reflecting that porcine cnvs occurred in gene-rich regions in the genome.

in order to provide insight into the functional enrichment of the cnvs, gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analyses were performed for the genes in cnvrs with the david bioinformatics resources. the go and pathway analyses revealed that there were  <dig> significant terms  and  <dig> significant pathways after benjamini correction. our results are consistent with previous studies in other mammals that cnvrs are particularly enriched in genes related to immunity, sensory perception of the environment , response to external stimuli and neurodevelopmental processes  <cit> .

copy number variable genes in the cnvrs
according to the copy windows, we estimated the cns for all genes in the cnvrs identified by rd. in total, there were  <dig>  genes assigned copy numbers . the results showed that some of genes with high copy numbers belong to some multiple-member gene families, such as olfactory receptor , protein fam22g, udp-glucuronosyltransferase, atp-binding cassette subfamily g, butyrophilin subfamily  <dig> member a <dig>  leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily, melanoma-associated antigen, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member, and cytochrome p <dig>  this is consistent with previous studies that high copy number genes often belong to multiple-member gene families  <cit> .

excepting the above mentioned copy number variable gene families and those uncharacterized genes, there were  <dig> protein-coding genes with copy number range more than  <dig>  among the individuals investigated . further probing the potential functions of these  <dig> copy number variable genes, we found a suite of genes related to the immune response, meat quality, sexual and reproduction ability, nutrients metabolism and coat color, which representing a valuable resource for future studies on the relation between cnv genes and phenotype variation.

in particular, the kit gene is the most obvious copy number variable gene with functional significance, which has been confirmed that gene duplication and a splice mutation leading the skipping of exon  <dig> is responsible for the dominant white phenotype  <cit> . in our studies, we estimated the copy numbers of the kit, and obtained the copy number of the kit gene of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the solid white breeds yorkshire and landrace, respectively, while about two copies  in all other pigs having colored phenotypes . this is consistent with the causative relation between kit duplication and dominant white coat color identified before  <cit> . in particular, no cnvs were found in the kit gene of the rongchang pig , which is the chinese indigenous breed that is characterized for its solid white coat color on body and some black patches around the eyes and ears. the result confirmed the previous finding that the white coat colors in chinese pigs were not caused by the dominant white allele of kit
 <cit> .

among these  <dig> copy number variable genes, some genes were existed in specific breed or population. for instance, kynurenine/alpha-aminoadipate aminotransferase  and zinc finger protein  <dig>  have extremely high copy numbers in the re-sequenced meishan individuals  compared to the other individuals. to further explore copy number distributions of them at population levels across multiple breeds and mine potential function contributing to formation of particular breed features, we determined the absolute copy numbers of these two genes via qpcr. a total of  <dig> unrelated individuals from six pig breeds  were employed in the confirmation study. the primers used, average copy number estimates for these two genes in each breed are presented in figure  <dig> and additional file 6: table s <dig>  the validation outcomes showed the consistent tendency with that in rd analyses, i.e., both aadat and znf <dig> have above  <dig>  in average in meishan breeds, being approximately 2- to 4- folds higher than those in the other five breeds. in mouse, the activity of the rat and mouse’s aadat gene is associated with the transamination of alpha-aminoadipic acid, which is the final step in the major pathway  for the catabolism of l-lysine . znf <dig> pertains to the zinc finger gene family and has been proved involved in embryonic development  <cit> . concerning potential function of aadat and znf <dig>  we can speculate that extraordinary high copy numbers of aadat and znf <dig> likely account for the typical features, such as high fertility, roughage-resistance, lower growth rate in meishan pigs.figure  <dig>

discussion
in current study, we developed a sd map of reference genome with  <dig>  intervals and systemically performed the first genome-wide analysis of recent sds using the newest build of porcine genome  by both wgac and wssd methods. the construction of sd map herein presented essential sd features of pig genome, like inter-/intra-chromosomal patterns of sds and the identity of pairwise alignments, etc., aiding understanding of genome innovation, genomic rearrangements, and occurrences of cnv hotspots within species  <cit> . it has been reported  <cit>  that sds may contribute to the formation of some cnvs through the occurrence of nahr mechanisms. certain ancestral sds that were transmitted to their descendants may facilitate separate nahr in them, leading to the genesis and maintenance of cnvs. the impact of sd on the cnvs has also been reflected by our findings that there are significant association between the ancestral sds and cnvrs and cnv hotspots. from the practical perspective, the reference genome sd database generated in our study also provides a very useful calibration for filtering short-read artifacts, which is necessary for duplication/deletion detection in wssd analyses of individual ngs data. besides the sd map of the pig reference genome, we also constructed a cnv picture involving  <dig>  unique regions using wssd through re-sequencing  <dig> highly representative individuals from ten distinct breeds or populations. to our knowledge, this is the highest resolution cnv map so far in the pig genome. the abundance of cnv outcomes in our study further confirmed our initial expectation that individuals from multiple breeds, especially chinese indigenous breeds, can greatly contribute to the cnv identification. the alteration of copy numbers of these genes within cnvrs may be responsible for the genetic diversity among diverse breeds with distinctive natures, especially for those entailed in various chinese indigenous breeds.

additionally, we further confirmed the previous findings that the duplication of kit gene is responsible for the dominant white phenotypic breeds like landrace and yorkshire, while with the exception of chinese indigenous solid white breeds like rongchang pig surveyed. in our study, besides those multiple-member gene families and uncharacterized genes, a total number of  <dig> copy number variable genes have been mined within cnvrs across  <dig> individuals with different genetic backgrounds from ten distinct breeds, which merit functional validation in depth in follow-up studies. especially, the two genes, aadat and znf <dig>  entail obviously high copy numbers merely in meishan pigs, which can be considered as promising candidate functional genes in cnv-related association studies in the future.

in cnv detection, we adopted the read depth specific analytical tool mrsfast to map sequence reads to the reference genome. compared with other read depth methods considering merely one mapping location per read, mrsfast can map sequence reads to all possible locations for a sequence read, demonstrating advantages of detection power in searching for sd regions. highlights in our analyses involve three aspects:

firstly, we proposed an enhanced strategy to determine three different types of sliding windows to adjust the bias in cnv calling due to fragmented sequences in the process of hard masking of the reference genome, especially for ngs data with long sequence reads. we defined sliding windows based on unique hits where short-reads can be forward aligned with the reference sequence rather than non-masked bases employed in the original mrcanavar. this could largely conquer the inaccuracy of read depth calculation for each type of sliding windows arising from hard masking of the reference genome. accordingly, we could use more reliable read depth statistics to infer duplication/deletion and estimate copy number, leading to better sensitivity and specificity of duplication/deletion detection as well as increased accuracy of copy number estimation. the performance gain of the enhanced strategy over the original has been verified by qpcr as well as through simulation analyses.

secondly, we probed formation signatures of both sds of the pig reference genome and individualized cnvs in an integrated fashion. based on the identified cnvs and sds, we systemically explored associations of cnvrs with various genome features, building a comprehensive profile of genome-wide cnvs in swine.

finally, we exploited cnvs across the pig genome among ten distinct breed populations and dug out corresponding genes within these specific regions, which may be considered as the most important copy number variable genes responsible for genetic diversity and specific breed features. furthermore, we predicted absolute copy number of completely all genes within cnvrs across the genome and sifted out  <dig> protein-coding genes. most of these specific cnvs and cnv-related genes are firstly reported by our studies.

the wgac and wssd methods employed in this study have demonstrated obvious advantages. however, some limitations still exist in detecting sds and cnvs. specifically, wgac can identify whole-genome sds with the length of >1 kb and determine accurate sd breakpoints, but it does depend on the whole genome assembly of the individual investigated. it is also difficult for wgac to dissect high-identity sds, which should be further filtered by wssd. the wssd method has inevitable weakness in determining breakpoint due to its nature of relying on pre-defined sliding windows. considering the sliding length , the wssd method can merely identify a rough position of cnv breakpoint.

the inaccuracy of cnv breakpoint determination limited our view about the cnv formation. in this study we specially focused on recurrent cnvs instead of non-recurrent ones. recurrent cnvs show recurrent breakpoints in sds, arising by meiotic unequal or non-allelic homologous recombination  <cit> . in contrast, non-recurrent cnvs have unique breakpoints that are not dependent on sds, possibly arising by nonhomologous end-joining , microhomology-mediated end-joining , fork stalling and template switching , or microhomology-mediated break-induced replication   <cit> . our study showed a significant association between cnvs and ancestral sds in pig genome, giving evidence on the abundance of recurrent cnvs in our results. though it is possible to distinguish recurrent and non-recurrent cnvs based on their differences in breakpoint distribution  and association with sds   <cit> , the ambiguity of cnv breakpoints due to the shortness of the wssd method made it unfeasible to achieve this goal.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we proposed an enhanced strategy to determine three different types of sliding windows to adjust the bias in cnv calling due to fragmented sequences in the process of hard masking of the reference genome, and then exploited both segmental duplications  and individualized cnvs across the pig genome among ten distinct breed populations and dug out corresponding genes within these specific regions. our studies lay out one way for characterization of cnvs in the pig genome, provide insight into the pig genome variation and prompt cnv mechanisms studies when using pigs as biomedical models for human diseases.
