BACKGROUND
the dna binding with one finger  proteins are a family of plant-specific transcription factors characterised by a single zinc-finger dna-binding domain. so far dof proteins have been identified in chlamydomonas reinharditii, where only one dof gene is present, in ferns, mosses and in higher plants  <cit> .

the number of dof genes varies depending on the species; bioinformatic analysis of the arabidopsis and rice genome predicts  <dig> and  <dig> dof genes, respectively  <cit> , while  <dig> are present in barley  <cit> ,  <dig> in wheat  <cit> , and  <dig> in sorghum  <cit> . members of this family have been found to be involved in the regulation of diverse plant-specific processes. although the biological role of many dof proteins has not been clarified yet, a number of them has been shown to be involved in responses to light and phytohormones, as well as in seed development and germination  <cit> .

seed germination is regulated by environmental factors such as light, temperature and nutrients, and by phytohormones, particularly gibberellins  and abscissic acid   <cit> . the effect of light is mediated mainly by the photoreceptor phytochrome b   <cit> , and light modulates in opposite ways the levels of ga and aba, as it induces ga biosynthesis and causes a reduction in aba levels  <cit> . among the factors involved in phyb-mediated ga-induced seed germination, the bhlh transcription factor phytochrome interacting factor 3-like  <dig>  represents the master repressor of this process in arabidopsis  <cit> .

we have previously shown that inactivation of the dof proteins dag <dig> and dag <dig> affects in opposite ways seed germination: dag <dig> mutant seeds required more light and ga than wild-type seeds to germinate, whereas germination of dag <dig> seeds was less dependent on these factors  <cit> .

recently, we have also pointed out that dag <dig> acts as a negative regulator in the phyb-mediated pathway: dag <dig> gene expression is reduced in seeds irradiated for 24 hours with red light, and this reduction is dependent on pil5; in pil <dig> mutant seeds dag <dig> expression is reduced irrespective of light conditions, indicating that dag <dig> acts downstream of pil <dig>  moreover, dag <dig> negatively regulates ga biosynthesis by directly repressing the ga biosynthetic gene atga3ox <dig>  <cit> . very recently we showed that in repressing atga3ox <dig> dag <dig> directly interacts with the ga insensitive  della protein  <cit> . furthermore, we pointed out that dag <dig> plays a role also in embryo development, as inactivation of dag <dig> results in a significant number of embryo abnormalities  <cit> , and simultaneous inactivation of both dag <dig> and gai results in an embryo-lethal phenotype. here, we provide evidence suggesting that dag <dig>  opposite to dag <dig>  functions as a positive regulator in the molecular pathway controlling seed germination, and that it is negatively regulated by dag <dig> 

differently from dag <dig>  dag <dig>  although it is expressed during embryo development, is not likely to play a role in this process, as dag <dig> mutant embryos develop similarly to wild-type embryos.

RESULTS
dag <dig> inactivation affects phyb-dependent seed germination
we have previously demonstrated that dag <dig> mutant seeds have a reduced germination potential, as they are substantially more dependent than the wild-type on the stimuli that promote germination  <cit> . this germination phenotype is opposite to that of dag <dig> mutant seeds. as we have recently shown that dag <dig> is a component of the phyb-mediated pathway controlling seed germination in arabidopsis  <cit> , we set up to verify whether dag <dig> is also a component of this regulatory network.

since seed germination, although promoted mainly by phyb, may be induced also by phya under very low light fluences  <cit> , we checked whether red  or far red  light may control expression of the dag <dig> gene. analysis of wild-type seeds exposed to phyb- or phya-dependent conditions, according to oh et al.  <dig>  <cit> , revealed that the dag <dig> gene is induced by exposure to r light , whereas dag <dig> expression in seeds exposed to fr light was not significantly different than in seeds kept in the dark . to assess whether dag <dig> plays its role under r light, we analysed seed germination under phyb-dependent conditions  <cit>  using the dag <dig> mutant previously characterised  <cit> , compared to the corresponding wild-type . germination of dag <dig> mutant seeds was significantly lower than that of wild-type seeds , thus confirming that dag <dig> plays a positive role in seed germination and showing that it acts in the phyb-mediated pathway.figure  <dig>

since water uptake is a fundamental requirement for seed germination, we verified whether expression of dag <dig> was regulated during imbibition. we performed rt-qpcr assays on wild-type  dry seeds, and on seeds imbibed under white  and r light or in the dark for  <dig> and 24 hrs. figure 2a shows that, compared to the low amount present in dry seeds, dag <dig> expression in seeds was much increased following water uptake in the dark . interestingly, the increase in dag <dig> mrna level in seeds exposed to w or r light was even higher, probably due to the effect of both light and imbibition . gus histological assays, performed on seeds of the dag2:gus transgenic line  <cit> , dry or imbibed 12 hours under w light or in the dark respectively, showed that the dag <dig> promoter was active only in the vascular tissue .figure  <dig>

dag <dig> is directly regulated by dag1
we have previously investigated the genetic interactions between the dag <dig> and dag <dig> genes by isolating the dag2dag <dig> double mutant, and showed that dag <dig> is epistatic over dag <dig>  <cit> . since the function of dag <dig> appears to be opposite to that of dag <dig>  we verified whether dag <dig> and dag <dig> would mutually affect their expression, by performing an rt- qpcr analysis in dag <dig> and dag <dig> mutant seeds imbibed for 12 hours in the dark or under r light. as shown in figure 3a, expression of dag <dig> is significantly  increased by lack of dag <dig>  irrespective of light conditions. conversely, dag <dig> expression level in wild-type and dag <dig> mutant seeds was comparable, both in the dark and under r light .figure  <dig>

to assess whether dag <dig> regulates dag <dig> by directly binding to the dag <dig> promoter in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays, utilizing the dag1dag1-ha line previously reported  <cit> . a scheme of the dag <dig> promoter is reported in figure 3c, showing the positions of the pcr fragments amplified for the chip assays, each containing different numbers of dof binding sites:  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> sites . consistently, anti-ha antibodies revealed that the amplification of fragments c and d were the most efficient, compared to the positive control, the fragment b <dig> of the atga3ox <dig> promoter bound by dag1-ha, as previously reported  <cit> . on the contrary, the signal for fragments a and b was quite faint. no pcr product was present for any of the fragments in the sample precipitated without antibodies as a negative control, and not even for the negative control on wild-type seeds . these results indicate that dag <dig> negatively regulates dag <dig> by directly binding the dag <dig> promoter.

pil <dig> negatively regulates dag <dig> in the dark
since dag <dig> and dag <dig> seem to have opposite roles in the phyb-mediated seed germination pathway, we wondered whether pil <dig>  which positively regulates dag <dig>  might negatively control the expression of dag <dig>  to verify this hypothesis, we analysed the expression of the dag <dig> gene in wild-type and pil <dig> mutant seeds after 12 hours imbibition in the dark or under r light. interestingly, as shown in figure  <dig>  the relative amount of dag <dig> in pil <dig> mutant seeds in the dark was significantly higher than in the wild-type, suggesting that pil <dig> negatively regulates the expression of dag <dig> in the dark. on the other hand, dag <dig> expression level in r light does not depend on pil <dig>  as it is degraded following interaction with phyb.figure  <dig>

the della proteins gai and rga are negative regulators of seed germination, acting downstream of pil <dig>  <cit> . in particular, we have recently shown that gai and dag <dig> mutually regulate their expression level and directly interact with each other  <cit> . thus, we set to assess whether gai and/or rga might control the expression level of dag <dig>  analysis of dag <dig> expression on gai-t <dig> and rga <dig> mutant seeds and on the corresponding col- <dig> wild-type seeds, imbibed 12 hours in the dark or under r light, revealed that neither gai nor rga control dag <dig> expression, as the relative amount of dag <dig> mrna was similar in the gai-t <dig> and rga <dig> single mutants compared to the wild-type, under both light conditions . to verify whether dag <dig> might regulate expression of these della proteins, we analysed the expression of gai and rga in dag <dig> mutant seeds compared to the wild-type. as shown in figure 5c, the expression of the rga gene was significantly increased in dag <dig> mutant seeds, whereas gai expression in wild-type and dag <dig> mutant seeds was not significantly different, both in the dark and under r light .figure  <dig>

, and are presented by the ratio of the corresponding wild-type mrna level in d, which was set to  <dig>  similar results were obtained from three independent experiments, and a typical result is presented with sd values. significative differences were analyzed by t-test .



these results point to dag <dig> as a positive component of light-mediated signalling pathway, downstream of pil <dig> and in turn controlling the della protein rga in the phyb signalling pathway.

we then verified whether expression of some factors known to be involved in the phya-signalling pathway  <cit>  may be affected in dag <dig> mutant seeds. in particular, we analysed expression of the fr light-regulated arabidopsis thaliana homeobox protein  <dig>  and phytochrome interacting factor 3-like  <dig>  genes, of the ga-regulated ga-stimulated arabidopsis  <dig> and  <dig> , and of the aba signalling gene aba insensitive  <dig> . our data revealed that under phya-dependent conditions neither expression of athb <dig> and pil <dig>  nor that of abi <dig> were affected in the dag <dig> mutant  whereas expression of both gasa <dig> and gasa <dig> was downregulated, thus opening the possibility that dag <dig> may also play a role in phya signalling.

the dag <dig> mutation alters ga metabolism
it has been shown that phyb controls the ratio of ga and aba levels during seed germination by altering the expression of different ga and aba metabolic genes through pil <dig>  <cit> . in particular, dag <dig> directly represses the ga biosynthetic gene atga3ox <dig> in cooperation with gai  <cit> , and its inactivation affects expression of the aba metabolic genes aba <dig>  aba <dig> and cyp707a <dig>  <cit> .

as dag <dig> seems to have a role opposite to dag <dig> in seed germination, we investigated whether dag <dig> would regulate the expression of ga and aba metabolic genes in germinating seeds. we performed a rt-qpcr analysis of the expression of the ga biosynthetic genes atga3ox <dig>  atga3ox <dig> and of the catabolic gene atga2ox <dig> in dag <dig> and wild-type seeds imbibed 12 hours in the dark or under r light. as shown in figure 6a, the expression of both ga biosynthetic genes was significantly reduced in dag <dig> mutant seeds irrespective of light conditions, whereas the catabolic gene atga2ox <dig> was expressed similarly in dag <dig> and wild-type seeds .figure  <dig>

as for aba metabolism, we analysed the expression level of the biosynthetic genes aba <dig>  aba <dig>  nced <dig> and nced <dig>  and of the catabolic gene cyp707a <dig>  on dag <dig> and wild-type seeds imbibed 12 hours in the dark or under r light. the expression profile of the biosynthetic genes, as well as of the catabolic gene cyp707a <dig> did not show significant differences in dag <dig> and wild-type seeds .

we have previously shown that the sensitivity of seeds to ga is affected by mutation of the dag <dig> gene: a concentration of ga 10-fold higher than for wild-type seeds was needed for dag <dig> mutant seeds to attain 50% germination  <cit> . to verify whether ga affect dag <dig> expression, we carried out an rt-qpcr analysis on wild-type seeds imbibed 24 hours in the presence of ga or of paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of ga biosynthesis. since ga metabolism is controlled by the aba level  <cit> , we also checked dag <dig> expression on wild-type seeds imbibed 24 hours in the presence of aba. the results of this analysis did not show any significant difference in dag <dig> transcript levels in all conditions tested, clearly showing that the dag <dig> gene is not regulated by ga nor by aba irrespective of light conditions .figure  <dig>

expression is not altered by aba or ga. relative expression level of dag <dig> in wild-type seeds imbibed 24 hours in the presence of ga, of paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of ga biosynthesis, or of aba in the dark , or under r light , compared to seeds imbibed in water as a control . relative expression levels were normalized with that of the ubq <dig> gene, and are presented by the ratio of the corresponding mrna level in seeds imbibed in water, which was set to  <dig>  similar results were obtained from three independent experiments, and a typical result is presented with sd values.



inactivation of the dag <dig> gene does not affect embryo development
we have recently shown that dag <dig> is expressed during embryo development, and that lack of dag <dig> affects this process  <cit> . thus, we set to assess whether also dag <dig> is required for embryo development. we first analyzed the expression of dag <dig> during embryo development by histochemical gus analysis of seeds of the dag2:gus transgenic line. gus activity was observed in embryos at the heart, torpedo, and bent-cotyledon stages. interestingly, gus staining was extended to all cells at the heart stage, whereas from the torpedo stage on it was restricted to the procambium . these results were confirmed and extended to later seed development stages by a rt-qpcr analysis on wild-type embryos at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after pollination , compared to mature seeds, to verify whether the dag <dig> gene was expressed also during seed maturation.figure  <dig>

expression of dag <dig>  at  <dig> and  <dig> dap was extremely high , and gradually decreased at  <dig> dap  compared to mature seeds .

despite the high expression level of the dag <dig> gene during embryo and seed development, microscopic analysis of dag <dig> mutant embryos did not reveal any noticeable phenotypical alteration .

discussion
we had previously shown that the dag <dig> mutant has seeds which require higher light fluences and higher ga levels than wild-type ones to germinate  <cit> , suggesting a positive role of the dof transcription factor dag <dig> in the regulation of seed germination.

here, we have expanded our analysis of the function of dag <dig> and we confirm the positive role of dag <dig> in seed germination and provide molecular and genetic evidences that assign this protein to the phyb/pil <dig> pathway.

to date the molecular pathway controlling seed germination has been partially elucidated. in this model pil <dig> acts as the master repressor, which inhibits seed germination in the dark partly by activating the expression of the genes encoding the della proteins rga and gai - which repress germination acting as negative ga signaling components - and of the transcription factors aba insensitive  <dig> and  <dig>  - which function as positive aba signaling molecules  <cit> . other transcription factors acting as repressors have been added in this pathway: the bhlh transcription factor spatula   <cit> , the c3h-type zinc finger protein somnus   <cit> , and the dof transcription factor dag <dig>  which we have shown to directly regulate the ga biosynthetic gene atga3ox <dig>  with the cooperation of gai  <cit> .

dag <dig> and dag <dig> share 77% overall aminoacidic identity, with 100% identity in the dof domain and, based on the opposite germination properties of dag <dig> and dag <dig> mutant seeds, we had assumed that the function of these two dof proteins was opposite. this was also supported by dag <dig> overexpression, which caused phenotypes similar to mutation of dag <dig>  <cit> . consistently, germination of dag <dig> mutant seeds in phyb-dependent conditions  was significantly reduced compared to wild-type seeds, whereas dag <dig> seeds showed a higher germination frequency  <cit> . in addition, dag <dig> expression is induced by exposure to r light, as opposed to dag <dig>  whose transcript level is lower in r light than in the dark  <cit> .

analysis of the germination properties of dag2dag <dig> double mutant seeds revealed that the dag <dig> mutation is epistatic over the dag <dig> one  <cit> . consistent with these previous reports, here we showed that dag <dig> expression is negatively controlled by dag <dig>  and that dag <dig> directly binds the dag <dig> promoter as demonstrated by chip assay.

this provides molecular support to the genetic evidence of the epistatic relationship between these two dof proteins shown in previous work  <cit> . we show here that dag <dig> is also repressed by pil <dig>  since the dag <dig> mrna level is significantly increased in pil <dig> mutant seeds in the dark but not under r light, where pil <dig> is degraded following interaction with phyb in its activated form .

since dag <dig> directly interacts with gai, and cooperates with this della protein in repressing the ga biosynthetic gene atga3ox <dig>  <cit> , and in the light of the opposite role of dag <dig> in this molecular pathway, one could hypotesize a relationship of dag <dig> with rga or gai. interestingly, our results revealed that expression of rga, but not of gai, is significantly affected in dag <dig> mutant seeds exposed to r light, suggesting that dag <dig> may negatively regulate this della gene, whereas expression of dag <dig> is not likely to be controlled by both rga and gai, as dag <dig> transcript levels are similar in rga <dig> and in gai-t <dig> mutant seeds compared to wild-type seeds, in both light conditions.

our expression analysis under phya-dependent conditions further supports the notion that dag <dig> acts in the phytochrome-mediated seed germination. in fact, of the marker genes of the phya-dependent germination pathway we analyzed, pil <dig>  athb <dig>  and abi <dig> remained unaffected in the dag <dig> mutant, while gasa <dig> and gasa <dig> were severely downregulated - consistent with the role of dag <dig> in the positive control of ga biosynthesis - opening the interesting possibility that dag <dig> participates also in phya signalling.

it should be noted that gasa <dig> has been previously characterised as a regulatory protein, induced by ga and involved in seed development and germination, independently of light conditions  <cit> .

phytochromes promote seed germination partly through ga. red light induces the expression of the two ga anabolic genes ga3-oxidase genes ga3ox <dig> and ga3ox <dig>  whereas it represses the ga catabolic gene ga2ox <dig>  <cit> . consistent with a positive role of dag <dig> in seed germination, mutation of the dag <dig> gene severely affects expression of both atga3ox <dig> and atga3ox <dig>  although it does not alter the expression level of atga2ox <dig>  unlike dag <dig>  dag <dig> does not seem to play its function through regulation of aba metabolism, as the expression profile of the aba metabolic genes tested is quite similar in dag <dig> and wild-type seeds  <cit> .

in recent years, the molecular mechanisms underlying light-mediated seed germination has been partly elucidated; however, it still remains an open question which are the positive regulators of this process. in fact, so far only long hypocotyl in far red <dig>  has been identified as a positive regulator of seed germination: hfr <dig> acts upstream of pil <dig> and interacts directly with pil <dig> thus sequestering it to prevent it from binding to its target genes  <cit> . interestingly, germination of hfr <dig> mutant seeds under phyb-dependent germination conditions is very similar to that of dag <dig> mutant seeds, strengthening the notion that dag <dig> is also a positive regulator in the phyb-dependent seed germination pathway.

as previously reported, dag <dig> and dag <dig> show a very similar expression profile, restricted to the vascular tissue  <cit> , and we showed that during embryo development, dag <dig> is expressed from late globular stage  <cit> . we also showed that dag <dig> mutant embryos displayed abnormal cell divisions at globular stage, altering the radial symmetry of the embryo axis  <cit> .

here we showed that, in contrast with dag <dig>  although also dag <dig> is expressed during embryo development, its absence does not produce obvious embryo phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
our genetic and molecular data indicate that dag <dig> is a new positive factor of the phyb/pil5-mediated seed germination pathway. dag <dig> is located downstream pil <dig> and dag <dig>  which directly represses dag <dig> expression. consistent with previous genetic data, dag <dig> plays an opposite role to dag <dig>  although our results indicate that dag <dig> acts on ga, but not on aba, metabolism.
