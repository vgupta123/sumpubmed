BACKGROUND
japanese apricot  is an important economic fruit crop in china and japan, with more than  <dig> cultivars in china  <cit> . japanese apricot fruit has consistently been one of the most valuable processing materials used in the food and wine-making industries and is believed to contain many physiochemicals beneficial to human health. however, the phenomenon of imperfect flowers is common and seriously affects production yields. the percentage of imperfect flowers depends on the cultivar; the highest is  <dig> % and the average is 35%  <cit> . imperfect flowers are characterised by pistils below the stamens, withered pistils or the absence of pistils, and hence, they fail to bear fruit  <cit> . several environmental factors and physiological processes have been shown to affect pistil development  <cit> . previous research indicated that several mirnas and multiple target genes are involved in flower development in model plants  <cit> . more recently, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridisation showed that the pmag mrna was highly-expressed in the sepals, carpels and stamens, and a weak signal was detected in the seeds and nutlets. no expressions were detected in the leaves or petals, but no significant differential was expressed between perfect and imperfect flowers  <cit> . meanwhile, comparative proteomic analyses were performed on perfect and imperfect flowers, and several differently-expressed proteins were identified  <cit> . however, the type of molecular mechanism involved in pistil abortion remains unknown in japanese apricot.

small rnas  are low molecular weight rnas with regulatory functions. based on differences in biogenesis and action, srnas are grouped into two categories: short interfering rnas  and micrornas   <cit> . micrornas are non-coding rnas, 21– <dig> nucleotides  long, which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . in plants, mirnas are processed from the stem-loop regions of long primary transcripts by a dicer-like enzyme and are loaded into silencing complexes, where they generally direct the cleavage of complementary mrnas  <cit> . identified in plants less than 10 years ago  <cit> , mirnas are already known to play numerous crucial roles at each major stage of development, typically at the cores of gene regulatory networks, targeting genes that are themselves regulators, such as those that encode transcription factors, suggesting that plant mirnas are master regulators  <cit> . among non-transcription factor targets, many mirnas encode f-box proteins or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes implicated in targeting selected proteins for proteasomal degradation, indicating mirnas play a role in regulating protein stability and plant development  <cit> . mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> play important roles in flowering-time regulation and belong to ambient temperature-responsive mirnas in plants  <cit> . mir <dig> has also acquired specialised species-specific functions in other aspects of plant development, such as cleistogamy and tuberisation  <cit> .

the fact that a large number of the known mirnas in the plant kingdom, from mosses and ferns to higher flowering plants, are evolutionarily conserved has been used as a practical indicator for the identification or prediction of mirnas using homology searches in other species  <cit> . recently developed, next-generation, high-throughput sequencing technologies provide a powerful tool for identifying, as well as quantifying, mirnas. these technologies open up the possibility of exploring srna populations in economically important species such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , oryza sativa <cit> , populus trichocarpa <cit> , vitis vinifera <cit> , arachis hypogaea <cit> , citrus sinensis <cit> , citrus trifoliate <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , glycine max <cit> , carthamus tinctoriuscucumis sativus <cit> , rehmannia glutinosa <cit>  and others. by means of high-throughput sequencing, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were shown to be drought-responsive mirnas in medicago truncatula <cit> . mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir172a are involved in the mutant trait formation of lycopene accumulation in sweet orange  <cit> .

although mirnas have been extensively studied in the past, there has be no systematic examination of mirnas performed on the japanese apricot. to investigate the role of mirnas on the pistil development of japanese apricot, high-throughput sequencing technology  was employed to survey srna populations from perfect and imperfect flower buds.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing of small rnas from japanese apricot flower bud tissue
to identify mirnas involved in the development of japanese apricot flowers, solexa sequencing was used on libraries of small rnas from perfect and imperfect flower buds. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained from perfect and imperfect flower bud libraries, respectively, after filtering out those reads without small rna sequences, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length , of which the majority were 19– <dig> nt long. the most abundant small rnas in the perfect and imperfect libraries were  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt long, respectively. the distribution of  <dig> nt small rnas was approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % in perfect and imperfect libraries, respectively, while the distribution of  <dig> nt small rnas was approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the perfect and imperfect libraries, respectively. after removal of the adaptor, insert, poly and short rnas of < <dig> nt,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> redundant clean reads were obtained from the perfect and imperfect flower buds, respectively, including rrna, trna, snrna, snorna, mirna and several other unannotated reads . of these clean reads,  <dig> %  were perfect-specific,  <dig> %  were imperfect-specific, and  <dig> %  were present in both . the average number of common sequence frequency was  <dig> , while that of library-specific reads was not more than  <dig>  . among the srnas sequenced, unannotated redundant reads accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % for perfect and imperfect flower buds, respectively.

identification of known mirnas and evolutionary conservation
to identify the known mirnas, the srna library was blastn searched for known mature plant mirnas in mirbase  <dig>  . following the blastn searches and further sequence analysis,  <dig> unique sequences, belonging to  <dig> families, in the perfect and imperfect libraries were found to be orthologues of known mirnas from other plant species, which had previously been deposited in the mirbase database .

the number of members in differently-conserved mirna families was analysed . a majority of the  <dig> mirna families contained several members, and three families  possessed multiple members, with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. nine mirna families, namely mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  had only one member.

the counts of reads for known mirna families were also analysed, and it was found they indicated large divergences in expression frequency among these mirnas. the number of reads for conserved mirnas sequenced from the same, or different, mirna families also varied drastically, with mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> represented most frequently in the two libraries. of these, mir <dig> was represented the most frequently, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies in the perfect and imperfect libraries, respectively. mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were moderately abundant in the two libraries, while mir <dig> was absent from the perfect library. it appeared, therefore, that the mirna population present in the perfect library differed from that present in the imperfect library to some extent .

to investigate the evolutionary roles of these known mirnas, extensive comparisons were performed against known mirnas in other plant species, including physcomitrella, selaginella, picea, pinus, arabidopsis, brassica, ricinus, glycine, medicago, gossypium, solanum, aquilegia, citrus, populus, vitis, oryza, sorghum and zea . among the mirna sequences obtained from japanese apricot, members in five of families  showed a lack of conservation of sequence identity compared to orthologues from  <dig> other plant species. generally, japanese apricot mirnas had corresponding homologues in at least two plant species. japanese apricot, arabidopsis and vitis vinifera shared  <dig> conserved mirna families. twelve  out of  <dig> families had orthologues in coniferophyta and embryophyta, indicating that these  <dig> japanese apricot mirna families are ancient. twelve  out of  <dig> families only had homologues in angiosperm, indicating that these  <dig> japanese apricot mirna families are recent. in addition, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> only had homologues in eudicotyledons, suggesting that these mirnas are probably involved in the regulation of specific development, such as the development of embryos and cotyledons.

identification of potentially novel mirnas/new members of known mirna families and nucleotide bias
the mireap prediction software developed by the beijing genomics institute  was used to identify potentially novel mirnas and new members of known mirna families by exploring the secondary structure based upon a trans-species alignment of apricot small rna data against the peach  genome. after removal of the conserved mirnas, sequences were aligned with the peach genome sequence. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mirna candidates were obtained from the perfect and imperfect flower bud libraries, respectively. the prediction of potentially novel mirna/new members of known mirna families candidates was summarised, including the base bias on the first position among small rna candidates of certain lengths. based on this summary, prediction accuracy could be assessed according to the base bias of known mirnas. the majority of these novel mirna candidates had lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> nt, and started with a 5′ u .

among the mirna candidates,  <dig> were identified with complementary mirna*s , indicating that these candidate mirnas were most likely new in japanese apricot, and several potentially novel ones may be unique to japanese apricot or prunus plants. the counts of several mirna*s of these potentially novel mirnas were low . nevertheless, no requirement for counts of mirna*s was given in the most recent criteria for the annotation of plant mirnas  <cit> . therefore, these mirnas were still considered to be potentially new. candidate mirnas with only one mirna* have been identified as new mirnas in rice and leguminous plants. the minimum free energy  for the hairpin structures of mirna precursors was lower than −18 kcal/mol, and the length of new mirna precursors ranged from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt .

differentially expressed mirnas between perfect and imperfect flower bud libraries
small rnas in the perfect and imperfect libraries were enriched for lengths of 21– <dig> nt , a typical range for plant mirnas. for small rnas shorter than  <dig> nt, the imperfect flower buds had higher expression levels than the perfect flower buds, while for small rnas longer than  <dig> nt, the opposite was the case. in addition to the different length distributions of small rnas, the proportions of each type of small rna in the two libraries were also different . the proportion of mirnas in perfect flower buds was higher than that in imperfect flower buds. however, rrnas, snrnas and trnas in imperfect flower buds were higher than in perfect flower buds. in summary, the small rna transcriptomes of the two libraries exhibited certain differences with respect to length distribution and composition.

in order to identify mirnas related to pistil development, the normalised expressions of mirnas in the perfect and imperfect small rna libraries were compared. the mirnas with changes in expression levels greater than  <dig> -fold and p-values less than  <dig>  are presented in table  <dig>  the results from high-throughput sequencing showed that seven known mirnas and six potentially novel mirnas/new members of known mirna families were relevant to pistil development . of these  <dig> sequences, nine demonstrated a greater than three-fold change in expression levels between the perfect and imperfect libraries. among the six differentially expressed potentially novel mirnas/new members of known mirna families, mir <dig> and mir482c were perfect specific, while mir <dig>  mi171d and mir319b were imperfect specific. three mirnas were down-regulated, and ten mirnas were up-regulated in pistil abortion .

to confirm the differential expression of the mirnas, the expressions of four of the seven known mirna genes and five of the six novel mirna genes were analysed using poly qrt-pcr. the expression level of each gene in the perfect and imperfect flower buds was compared with its abundance in the sequencing data of the srna library. the results indicated that nine mirnas had the same expression patterns in the perfect and imperfect flower buds as those in the sequencing data .

prediction of potential targets of differentially expressed mirnas
an indication of the genes responsible for pistil abortion was sought by the inspection of  <dig> potential targets of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas . there are three ontologies in gene ontology : molecular functions, cellular components and biological processes. go categories were assigned to all  <dig> putative targets, according to their cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes . on the basis of molecular function, the genes were finally classified into  <dig> categories, as shown in figure 8b. the top three over-represented go terms are enzyme activity, nucleic acid binding and other binding. thirteen biological processes were identified, with the three most frequent being developmental process, regulation of transcription and response to stress .

the high frequency of ‘regulation of transcription’ and ‘response to stress’ terms are easily explainable, since mirnas are involved in diverse regulatory events  <cit> . moreover, many flower developmental genes were also predicted targets of mirnas. one gene involved in ovule development was further analysed  ). the results implied the possible roles of mirnas in the regulation of biological processes involved in pistil abortion.

discussion
high-throughput sequencing of japanese apricot small rnas
most conserved mirnas in plants have been identified by traditional sanger sequencing or computational approaches  <cit> . however, a large number of non-conserved or species-specific mirnas in plants usually accumulate at a lower level than conserved mirnas, and are typically not easily revealed using traditional sequencing methods  <cit> . therefore, the construction and high-throughput sequencing of small rna libraries seems to be the most efficient method for mirna identification  <cit> . the aim of this work was to identify the evolutionary known and potentially novel japanese apricot-specific mirnas recovered from perfect and imperfect flower bud libraries, and to analyse the differentially expressed mirnas associated with pistil development. in our study, small rna libraries of japanese apricot from the solexa platform, one of the newly-developed high-throughput sequencing technologies, generated shorter reads  but yielded 1– <dig> million reads per sample. this method has been most popularly employed to discover mirnas in various organisms. as expected, a large number of reads were generated by our small rna libraries, of which  <dig> are known to belong to  <dig> families. in addition,  <dig> potentially novel mirnas/new members of known mirna families were identified in japanese apricot.

taking a broader view of the high-throughput sequencing of small rnas in japanese apricot, it was observed that small rnas of  <dig> nt dominated the library of unique species, as has been reported for many other plant species, such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , citrus trifoliata <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , citrus sativus <cit>  and citrus sinensis <cit> . however, the most abundant small rnas in the imperfect library were  <dig> nt long. normally, the length of small rnas is between  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt. length distribution analysis is a helpful way to assess the composition of small rna samples. for example, mirna is normally  <dig> nt or  <dig> nt long, whereas sirna is  <dig> nt long  <cit> . the data obtained here imply that the most abundant small rnas are mirnas and sirnas in perfect and imperfect flower buds, respectively.

the overall distribution pattern of small rnas  in japanese apricot is significantly different from that in pinus contorta, a conifer species in which  <dig> nt rnas are more abundant  and  <dig> nt rnas are less frequent . a striking difference also exists when comparing japanese apricot small rnas with monocot species of rice. when compared with eudicotyledon species of sweet orange, the difference is not as noticeable, but still exists, such that  <dig> nt srnas are most frequent  while  <dig> nt srnas are less common . these analyses indicate that the small rna transcriptome is complicated across plant species and can be significantly different between phylogenetically distant plant families.

mirnas identified in plant flowers
arabidopsis mirnas  <cit>  regulate multiple developmental events. in the past, mirna identification in flowers using sequencing approaches has been common, and has been applied in the study of arabidopsis <cit> , tomato  <cit> , orchid  <cit> , boechera <cit> , maize  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , safflower and grape  <cit> . in this study, high-throughput sequencing of extracts from japanese apricot flower buds led to the identification of  <dig> known mirnas, belonging to  <dig> families, and  <dig> potentially novel mirnas/new members of known mirna families. analysis of these revealed that some mirna families are expressed in the flowers of other plant species, but they are not flower-specific. mir156/mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were represented most frequently in the libraries in this study. the involvement of three mirna families  in flowering-time regulation has been recently demonstrated in other investigations  <cit> . mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> specify particular cell types during the later stages of flower development  <cit> . furthermore, the comparison of these species’ mirnas showed that mir156/mir <dig> and mir <dig> may be components of a regulatory pathway mediating the transition between the vegetative and reproductive phases in plants. in addition, mir <dig> regulates stem cell fate and defines the inner boundary of apetala <dig> and pistillata expression domains in arabidopsis floral meristems  <cit> . by targeting apetala <dig> and type iii homeodomain-leucine zipper  genes, mir <dig> regulates the temporal program of floral stem cells  <cit> . it is believed that mir <dig>  like mir <dig>  targets mrnas coding for arf, which are dna-binding proteins that are thought to control transcription in response to the phytohormone auxin  <cit> . transcriptional regulation is important for many of the diverse developmental responses to auxin signals, which include cell elongation, division and differentiation in both roots and shoots  <cit> .

mirnas possibly involved in the regulation of pistil abortion in imperfect japanese apricot flower buds
the characterisation and comparative profiling of entire sets of small rnas , especially mirnas, provides the foundation for unraveling the complex mirna-mediated regulatory networks controlling pistil abortion in imperfect japanese apricot flower buds. in this study, a number of mirnas were shown to be differentially expressed between perfect and imperfect flower buds. compared with the perfect library, four known mirna genes and three potentially novel mirna/new members of known mirna families genes were expressed exclusively in imperfect flower buds. on the other hand, it was found that two potentially novel mirnas/new members of known mirna families were perfect-specific. moreover, a total of seven known mirnas and six potentially novel mirnas exhibited significant expression changes between the perfect and imperfect libraries.

the relationship between the srna genes and the mirna target genes is one of the hot spots in the phenomenon of ‘mirna-associated transitivity’. target prediction of these differential mirnas could provide information on the biological processes regulated by mirna. the annotations of these potential mirna target genes provided an alternate view of gene regulation of the pistil abortion trait formation in imperfect flower buds. it was discovered that these groups of predicted mirna-target genes are possibly involved in the pistil abortion trait formation.

the majority of genes encoding transcription factors or f-box proteins have a significant role in the plant development  <cit> . in the present study, it was found that the predicted targets of mir <dig>  mir319a, mir319e, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir171d were either transcription factors or f-box proteins. in addition, it is predicted that mir319/mir319a/mir319e target arf <dig> genes and that mir160a targets arf16/ <dig>  auxin regulates a variety of physiological and developmental processes in plants. arf has been reported to regulate flower and leaf development  <cit> . arf <dig> is a transcriptional suppressor that has been found to be involved in ethylene, auxin, aba and brassinosteroid pathways, in order to control the onset of leaf senescence, floral organ abscission and ovule development  <cit> . arf <dig> promotes transitions between multiple stages of arabidopsis development and positively regulates flower development  <cit> . in this study, the expression of mir319/mir319a/mir319e was shown to be higher in imperfect than in perfect flower buds. consequently, the expression of arf <dig> was repressed by these mirnas and thus regulated pistil development. moreover, tcp <dig>  transcription factor genes and myb <dig>  which belong to a gamyb-like family of transcription factors, are also targets of mir319/mir319a/mir319e in our prediction, which agrees with previous reports  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that the over-expression of mir319/mir319a/mir319e may contribute to an increase in imperfect flower ratios in pistil development.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study first comparatively constructed the mirnaomes between perfect and imperfect japanese apricot flowers and identified  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> families. comparative profiling revealed that seven known mirnas exhibited significant expression differences between perfect and imperfect flower buds. in addition,  <dig> potentially novel mirnas/new members of known mirna families were also identified, by the presence of mature mirnas and corresponding mirna*s in the srna libraries. comparative analysis showed that six potentially novel mirnas were differentially expressed between perfect and imperfect flower buds. target predictions of the  <dig> differential mirnas resulted in  <dig> target genes. go annotation revealed that highly-ranked mirna target genes were those implicated in the developmental process, regulation of transcription and response to stress. these findings, both computational and experimental, provide valuable information for further functional characterisation of mirnas associated with pistil development in plants.
