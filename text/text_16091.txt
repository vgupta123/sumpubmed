BACKGROUND
nod26-like intrinsic proteins  are plant specific integral membrane proteins, belonging to the aquaporin water channel superfamily. nips can be traced back to the early developmental stage of primitive land plants  <cit> , indicating an important role during their evolution. amongst plant aquaporins, only nips have the glycerol transport activity  <cit> . it was reported that there are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nip genes encoded in the arabidopsis, rice, sorghum, and cucumis sativus genomes, respectively  <cit> . the divergence and proliferation of nips may be an adaptive response to an ever-changing environment  <cit> .

recent experimental evidences suggest that nips could perform a diverse range of functions, including a wider range for selectivity  <cit> . it was demonstrated that two constriction points within the pore, referred to as the conserved dual npa motifs and the aromatic/arginine  selectivity filter, primarily determine the substrate selectivity of plant aquaporins  <cit> . however, it appears that the ar/r filter, which consists of four amino acid residues from helix h <dig>  helix h <dig>  and loop le <dig> + le <dig>  plays a crucial role in determining the substrate selectivity of nips  <cit> . based on difference in the ar/r filter motif and on our phylogenetic tree reconstruction, it is evident that nips should be divided into three distinct subgroups  <cit> . the properties of the four residues making up the ar/r filter are remarkably different, leading to the significant variation of permeation ability for the proteins within each subgroup. in comparison to the nip i and nip ii subgroups, nip iii proteins possess the largest constriction size of the pore , which allows larger solutes such as silicic acid  to permeate  <cit> .

with a few exceptions, the function of most of the nip iii subgroup proteins remains unknown. of plant aquaporins, rice genes osnip2; <dig>  and osnip2; <dig> , and barley hvnip2; <dig> , which belong to the nip iii subgroup and localize in the plasma membrane, were demonstrated to function as a transporter of silicon across the biomembrane  <cit> , a compound that can enhance the resistance of plants to biotic and abiotic stress. moreover, it was found that rice osnip2; <dig> could be permeable to water, urea, boric acid, and silicic acid, but not glycerol. however, competition experiments indicated that this gene is a highly specific transporter of silicic acid  <cit> . when expressed in oocytes, both osnip2; <dig> and osnip2; <dig> were shown to have transport activity for arsenite but not arsenate  <cit> , with the former gene having a greater role in the major pathway for arsenite uptake  <cit> . in addition, the rice osnip2; <dig> was found to be responsible, at least partly, for the permeability to methylated arsenic species mma and dma  <cit> . all three arsenous acids are slightly smaller than silicic acid  <cit> , which may explain the permeability of osnip2; <dig>  given that arsenite and glycerol are structurally similar  <cit> , it is surprising that rice osnip2; <dig> does not transport glycerol  <cit> , and suggests that other structural features may be involved in the process of efficient substrate discrimination  <cit> .

nip genes generally exhibit a low expression level, and often show a tissue- and/or cell type specific expression pattern  <cit> . the rice gene osnip2; <dig> is specifically expressed in roots, and the expression level can be transiently enhanced during the heading stage  <cit> ; whereas osnip2; <dig> is expressed in both the shoots and roots, and its expression level in roots is much weaker than that of osnip2; <dig>  <cit> . the difference in expression pattern is consistent with their distinct silicon transport functions  <cit> . moreover, it was observed that the accumulation of silicon in different rice cultivars varies extensively, which might result from the differences in the expression of osnip2; <dig> and other silicon transporter genes in rice roots  <cit> . the barley hvlsi <dig>  like rice osnip2; <dig>  is specifically expressed in the basal root, and a weak correlation between silicon uptake and the expression level of hvlsi <dig> in eight tested cultivars was observed  <cit> . moshelion et al.  <cit>  examined the expression pattern of  <dig> aquaporin genes using macro-array hybridization, and found that zmnip2; <dig> is weakly expressed in maize suspension cultured cells. however, the function of zmnip2; <dig> remains to be further characterized precisely. in addition, the expression of rice osnip2; <dig> can be regulated by abiotic stresses. for instance, osnip2; <dig> expression is down-regulated during periods of dehydration and in response to the presence of aba  <cit> , but is induced by salt stress  <cit> .

homology modeling suggests that nip proteins share a common general three-dimensional structure  <cit> . the ar/r filter of cicer arietinum canod <dig> and cucurbita pepo cpnod <dig>  consists of gly , ser , gly  and arg   <cit> , identical to those nip iii proteins reported in grass species  <cit> , and suggests that they also function in silicon uptake and/or translocation  <cit> . however, for nip iii proteins in dicot species there is no any experimental evidence for the function in silicon uptake and/or translocation, although previous research revealed that the c. pepo cpnip2; <dig>  which is prominent in leaf veins, could catalyze the transmembrane flow of urea and water, but not glycerol  <cit> . therefore, it is intriguing to further investigate whether dicot nip iii genes can transport larger solutes like silicic acid. here we demonstrated shifts of selective constraint and positive selection may have been involved in the evolution of the nip iii proteins, which may correspond to functional differences observed between dicot and monocot nip iii genes.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of the nip iii subgroup proteins
the protein and cds sequences of approximately  <dig> plant genomes, as well as the cdna and genomic dna sequences of six other plant species  that belong to poaceae, arecaceae, musaceae, and zingiberaceae, respectively, were searched. we found that there is at least one nip <dig> gene presenting in all examined plant species except for two arabidopsis spp. . in monocotyledonous plants, there are two copies of nip <dig> encoded within each grass species, except for maize, where three nip iii proteins were characterized  <cit> ; while only one nip <dig> gene  was identified in elaeis oleifera, musa acuminate, zingiber officinale and curcuma longa. however, in the most tested dicotyledonous plants, besides g. max and cucumber, only a single copy of nip <dig> gene was identified. in addition, a homologous nip2-like protein was found in the licophyte selaginella moellendorffii and the gymnosperm species pinus taeda and picea sitchensis. these results imply that nip <dig> genes are relatively important for grasses.

in total,  <dig> nip iii subgroup sequences were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees, where the nip2-like homologs in s. moellendorffii, p. taeda and p. sitchensis were used as outgroup sequences to root the trees. it was observed that the me tree and nj tree showed the similar topology , where two distinct clades were clearly presented: the monocot- and dicot-specific clades , which indicated that the earliest proliferation of nip <dig> genes in angiosperms occurred after the monocot-dicot split approximately  <dig> million years ago   <cit> .

in the monocot-specific clade, two subclades, based on the support of bootstrap values , were further presented: the nip2; <dig> and nip2; <dig> subclades . within each subclade, the orthologous nip <dig> genes derived from rice, maize, sorghum, barley, wheat, switchgrass, and b. distachyon were tightly clustered together, a result suggesting that the proliferation and diversification of nip2s in poaceae occurred before the divergence of grasses. since previous studies revealed that the modern grasses diverged from a common grass ancestor  <cit> , and a whole genome duplication  event was estimated to have occurred about  <dig> mya  <cit> , we reason that the duplication of nip <dig> genes in grasses may result from the corresponding wgd. to validate this, we analyzed the syntenic relationship between the chromosomes where the two nip <dig> genes are located. we observed that three gene pairs including sbnip2;1/sbnip2; <dig>  bdnip2;1/bdnip2; <dig>  and osnip2;1/osnip2; <dig> are located into chromosomal regions that were supposed to have undergone large-scale segmental duplications  <cit> . in maize, zmnip2; <dig> and zmnip2; <dig>  sharing an identity of  <dig> % and  <dig> % at the protein and dna sequence level respectively, are closely phylogenetic related , although they are located in different chromosomes . therefore, the production of zmnip2; <dig> and zmnip2; <dig> was probably through the recent wgd event occurred in maize  <cit>  after its divergence with sorghum from a common ancestor ~ <dig> mya  <cit> .

in dicotyledonous plants, we found no evidence for the presence of nip iii genes in arabidopsis thaliana and arabidopsis lyrata. however, a nip iii protein cpanip2; <dig> was identified in carica papaya, a species sharing a common ancestor with a. thaliana ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . thus, it is parsimonious to infer that the nip iii gene in arabidopsis spp. were probably lost after their speciation from c. papaya. in addition, we observed that the four nip iii genes derived from three legumes  were clustered together and presented as a fabaceae-specific clade . the d4dtv value of soybean gmnip <dig> genes is very small , indicative of their recent duplication. since the soybean  genome has undergone two rounds of large-scale genome and/or segmental duplication at about  <dig> and  <dig> mya, respectively  <cit> , it is likely that the two gmnip2s were produced via the recent instead of the ancient large-scale duplication event. similarly, the three cucurbitaceae nip <dig> genes constituted a lineage-specific clade, where two nip2s  were derived from cucumis sativus. from the phylogenteic tree , it can be inferred that the duplication of csnip2; <dig> and csnip2; <dig> possibly predated the speciation time of cucumber and zucchini. analysis of the cucumber genome sequence successfully identified an ancient wgd, but did not reveal recent duplications  <cit> . using a global clock model implemented in paml  <cit> , we estimated the divergence time of the two csnip2s at ~ <dig>  mya; their d4dtv value is much larger  , suggestive of their ancient evolutionary past. interestingly, only one nip <dig> gene  was identified in the poplar genome, although it has experienced two rounds of wgd  <cit> .

sequence characteristic analysis
in grasses, the orthologous nip iii subgroup proteins are significantly homologous to each other . the average identity of sequences for the nip2; <dig> and nip2; <dig> subclade proteins is  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, indicating that the nip <dig> orthologs within each subclade can perform the same or similar functions. in agreement with this postulation, barley hvnip2; <dig> , like rice osnip2; <dig> , was demonstrated to function in mediating the influx of silicic acid in roots  <cit> . in addition, we calculated the d4dtv values for the paralogous genes in grasses, and found that with one exception , other paralogous gene pairs are highly diverged, having a d4dtv value not less than  <dig>  . therefore, the sequence variation should be partly responsible for their functional diversification, as indicated by the functional studies of osnip2; <dig> and osnip2; <dig>  <cit> .

in contrast to the high similarity in grasses, large sequence variation was observed among dicot nip2s that share an average identity of  <dig> %. in addition, we found that the overall average identity between monocot and dicot nip2s is decreased up to  <dig> %. nonetheless, both monocot and dicot nip2s show similar gene structures, possessing five exons and four introns . although the introns vary extensively in length, three exons  are remarkablely conserved in tested plants , suggesting that strong functional constraints should impose on the corresponding exonic regions. in the two soybean gmnip2s, both the exons and introns are slightly different in length, supporting of their recent expansion. however, substantial variation is found in the intron lengths, especially in the second and fourth introns for the zmnip2;2/zmnip2; <dig> gene pair, implying that their diversification may be ongoing. the similar cases were also observed in cucumber  and other paralogous gene pairs in grasses.

as reported, the dual conserved npa motifs and ar/r filter play determinant roles for the selectivity of aquaporin proteins  <cit> . the ar/r filter is located in the narrowest region on the extra-membrane mouth of the pore, which is approximately 8Å above the npa region  <cit> . we observed that the four residues making up the ar/r filter are g, s, g, and r in tested proteins, which is consistent with the typical feature of nip iii proteins, except for csnip2; <dig>  where the first residue in the h <dig> is c instead of g . we cloned and re-sequenced the csnip2; <dig> gene, and confirmed the replacement of g with c. as the composition of ar/r filter defines the pore size, pore hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding between pore and substrate  <cit> , the substitution of the tiny gly  residue with the bulkier cys  may give rise to a much narrower aperture than other nip iii proteins . therefore, functional analysis is urgently needed to further investigate why the cucumber genome has evolved to two nip iii proteins, but one of them has possibly lost its ability for permeating larger solutes, such as silicic acid. as for the npa motifs, we found that the first npa motif is markedly conserved, whereas the second one is slightly variant, with the substitution by npv in csnip2; <dig> and cpnip2; <dig> . nip proteins often have unorthodox npa motifs  <cit> , which are different from other mips. furthermore, mutations in the npa motifs do not change the selectivity of nip proteins  <cit> , it thus seems that the npa motif is not a crucial factor in determining the substrate selectivity for nips  <cit> . however, whether the npa motifs play critical roles in nip iii proteins remains to be further examined, since the npa motifs are highly conserved in nip iii proteins, only with the exceptions of csnip2; <dig> and cpnip2; <dig> 

positive selection in the nip <dig> gene sequences
the codeml program implemented in the paml v <dig>  software package  <cit>  was utilized to test the hypothesis of positive selection in the nip iii subgroup genes. the estimation of positive selection was based on the tree topology shown in figure  <dig>  where only full length sequences were included into analysis. to test whether there are variable ω ratios at amino acid sites, two pairs of models  were selected and compared. in the model m <dig>  a single ω is assumed for all sites in the alignment. under this model, the estimated ω value is  <dig>  for nip2s with the log-likelihood score ℓ = - <dig> . compared to other models, m <dig> shows a worse fit for the data because of its much lower log-likelihood value than all other models , and thereby ruling out the possibility that all sites in the alignment have the same ω ratio. in contrast, the selection models  fit the data significantly better than those that do not permit positive selection  , indicating that the nip <dig> genes should be under adaptive evolution where some sites might undergo amino acid substitutions with high rate.

note: a, codon sites under positive selection that are estimated using the program codeml implemented in the paml package v <dig> . asterisk  denotes posterior probability >  <dig> .

b, codon  positions presented above are based on the rice osnip2; <dig> gene.

the comparison of m <dig> vs m <dig> reveals that ω is not uniformly distributed along the nip <dig> coding dna sequences, and about  <dig> % codon sites may be under the influence of positive selection . similarly, compared with m <dig> model, the m <dig> model suggests that ~ <dig> % of codons fall in a category with estimated ω value  <dig> , a result indicative of strong positive selection.

based on the bayesian posterior probabilities, two and  <dig> codon site candidates for positive selection were identified for the m <dig> and m <dig> models respectively, of which the posterior probabilities of sites  <dig> and  <dig> are > <dig>  in both analyses . in the m <dig> model, the posterior probabilities of three site candidates  are all less than  <dig> , and thereby excluded from further analysis. furthermore, we observed that sites  <dig> and  <dig> are located in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. after projecting the two sites onto the simulated three-dimensional structures, we clearly observed that the first site  is located in the n-terminus, while the other site  in the periplasmic la  .

using a variety of codon site models, we demonstrated the influence of positive selection in the evolution of nip iii subgroup genes . compared with the helix regions, the n- and c-terminus are highly divergent in nip <dig> proteins . nevertheless, it was found that plant aquaporins were regulated by phosphorylation within the cytosolic termini and loop regions  <cit> . we used the netphos <dig>  server  <cit>  to predict any possible serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in nip <dig> proteins, and indeed found many predicted candidates in the corresponding regions . these results suggest that the n-terminus and loop regions are functionally important, although they are not conserved as much as the helix regions. the site  <dig> is located in the loop between helix h <dig> and h <dig> . in rice osnip2; <dig>  the residue at the corresponding site is ser , which was predicted to be a serine phosphorylation site with high possibility ; whereas in other nip2s, the site is occupied by variant amino acids with different physiochemical properties . therefore, positive selection in these regions may act as one major determinant in driving the functional divergence of nip2s.

to test whether variable ω ratios are present among lineages, we performed the likelihood ratio test  to compare the two extreme models: the one-ratio model that assumes a unique rate ratio for all branches, and the free-ratio model that assumes an independent ω ratio for each branch  <cit> . the log-likelihood value under the one-ratio model is - <dig> , while the value is - <dig>  for the free-ratio model. twice the log likelihood differences, 2Δℓ =  <dig> , is strongly statistically significant , revealing a heterogeneous selective pressures among lineages. we further observed that some branches of the nip iii gene phylogeny include several internal branches having ω > <dig> , showing strong evidence for adaptive evolution.

in a gene family, the fate of new genes produced by duplication would either evolve a new function under positive selection, or be lost during evolution  <cit> . as reported, plants have evolved more nip proteins with multi-functions  <cit> . we revealed that positive selection was involved in the functional diversification of nip subfamily genes  <cit> , as well as in the evolution of nip iii subgroup genes . the grasses encoded two or three nip <dig> genes, where the nip2; <dig> gene has evolved new functions differentiating from that of nip2;1s, which may represent an evolutionary advantage for grasses to uptake and translocate silicon efficiently.

functional divergence analysis of nip <dig> proteins
the gu  methods  <cit>  implemented in diverge <dig>  <cit>  were used to evaluate type-i  and type-ii  functional divergence between gene clusters of interests in the nip iii subgroup. the advantage of these methods is that they use amino acid sequences, and thereby is not sensitive to saturation of synonymous sites  <cit> .

based on the distinct expression patterns and functions of osnip2; <dig> and osnip2; <dig>  <cit> , we supposed that functional divergence in nip2s should have occurred after gene duplication in grasses. unexpectedly, we found no statistical evidence for type-i functional divergence between nip2; <dig> s and nip2;2s in grasses, because the coefficient of type-i functional divergence was insignificant . however, when the posterior probability  of divergence was determined for each site by diverge <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> sites with high probability  were identified to be type-ii functional divergence related , indicative of a radical shift of amino acid properties  <cit> . it appears that site-specific changes of amino acid physiochemical properties may act as one of the major evolutionary powers in driving the functional divergence of nip <dig> proteins after their duplication in grasses. of the seven sites identified,  <dig> of them are located in helixes and two in loop regions  . further, we observed that although the three sites located in helix h <dig> , h <dig> , and le  are physically close to the four residues of the ar/r filter  in the amino acid sequences, only g/a in le is predicted to spatially interact with r in le <dig>  in addition, we found that the two residues in lb  and le  are not only physically adjacent to the dual npas, but spatially interact with the third residue  in the npa motifs. lb and le are functional loops that participate in the formation of the aqueous pore  <cit> , implying that the a/s and g/a residues should be structurally important. moreover, a contact between le  and helix h <dig>  was also observed. therefore, the radical change of physiochemical property of the  <dig> sites may be the primary contributor to the functional divergence of nip2s in grasses.

we further employed the diverge <dig> to assess the coefficients of type-i and type-ii functional divergence  between monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous nip2s. we found that the null hypothesis  can be strongly rejected, because the θi value is statistically significant . this indicates that shifted selective constraints must strongly operate on some amino acid sites in monocot and dicot nip2s, and thereby leading to a lineage-specific functional evolution after their divergence from an ancient common ancestor. furthermore, two critical amino acid sites  were predicted to be highly type-i functional divergence related , where one site is located in la, and the other in the helix h <dig> . the caas in la  is proximal to the identified positively selected site  <dig> s. using intermap <dig> d  <cit> , the two sites are predicted to spatially contact with each other, and have probably coevolved during evolution. in dicot nip2s, the caas in h <dig> is invariant val , whereas it is substituted with ile  in some monocot nip2s. nevertheless, no obviously statistical evidence for the type-ii functional divergence was found . together, these observations indicated that amino acid site-specific shifts of evolutionary rate and changes of amino acid property should not uniformly act on the nip2s after the split of monocots and dicots.

determination of functional specificity positions among orthologous nip <dig> proteins
many protein families, such as the aquaporin superfamily, contain homologous proteins that have a common biological function but with different specific substrates and interactive molecules  <cit> . it is thus necessary to identify residues that are significantly responsible for the functional specificity, which may be useful in biological studies. to this end, we used the sdppred  <cit>  server to predict any possible specificity determining positions  that may determine the functional specificity of orthologous nip <dig> proteins after the monocot-dicot split. as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>   <dig> sdps were identified to be highly relevant to functional specificity. besides, we also observed that  <dig> out of the five sdps are located in the n-terminus, and the other two sdps lie on helix h <dig> .

note: "alignment position" designates the amino acid position in the multiple sequence alignment presented in additional file  <dig>  the amino acid site 84q that is predicted to be a possible sdp is shown in bold and italic.

in addition, we noticed that when using osnip2; <dig> as the reference sequence, the residue at the site  <dig> was invariant gln  in monocots including musa acuminate and elaeis oleifera, except for the zingiber officinale zonip <dig>  where the corresponding site was occupied by ala  . whether the substitution of q with a in zonip <dig> is sequencing or assembling error is unknown. however, if the residue 72a in zonip <dig> was replaced by g, this site was also predicted to be a sdp with high confidence . moreover, it was found that the residue 84q lies on the channel side , and exhibits an interaction with the first residue of the ar/r filter in h <dig>  this suggests that the site 84q may be involved in the formation of a functional pore, although the ar/r residues are identical in rice osnip2; <dig> and cucumber csnip2; <dig> . if it was true, the z. officinale zonip <dig> gene, like dicots, may perform a dissimilar function from other monocots.

notably, we found that the predicted sdps for the nip iii subgroup are mainly distributed in two spatial regions. as discussed above, the site 84q was postulated to be involved in the formation of the channel . by contrast, most of other sdps lie on the surface of the protein and likely participate in establishing the tetrameric structure.

CONCLUSIONS
the current nip iii subgroup proteins were originated and diverged from an ancient common ancestor that emerged before the divergence of monocots and dicots. subsequently, monocot- and dicot-specific expansion of nip <dig> genes occurred. plant nip2s show relatively conserved gene structures, each containing five exons and four introns. with only one exception , the ar/r filter of nip <dig> proteins consists of g, s, g, and r.

all tested grasses encoded at least two nip <dig> proteins in their genomes. these paralogous nip2s were probably produced via the whole genome duplication  or segmental chromosomal duplication event occurred in the common ancestor of modern grasses. the proliferation and diversification of nip2s in grasses may be, at least partially, responsible for their highly efficient influx of silicon in roots and then transporting them out of xylem. by contrast, most of tested dicot plants have only one nip <dig> gene. due to the small constriction size of the pore, csnip2; <dig> might be unable to transport silicon, although the cucumber genome encoded two nip <dig> genes. in particular, arabidopsis spp. should have lost their nip iii subgroup genes during evolution.

the nip iii subgroup genes have experienced strong positive selection and diverged in function between monocots and dicots. several sdps were identified to be responsible for the determination of functional specificity of monocot and dicot nip <dig> proteins. these findings provide deeper insights into understanding the evolutionary mechanisms of nip iii subgroup proteins and their functional diversification.
