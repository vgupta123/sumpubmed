BACKGROUND
fire blight, caused by the gram-negative enterobacterium erwinia amylovora, is a devastating disease of rosaceous plants in the subfamily maloideae that has global economic importance for apple and pear production  <cit> . typical symptoms include flower necrosis, immature fruit rot, shoot curvature , blackened leaves , bacterial ooze secretion, and cankers on woody tissues.

production of phenolic compounds with antimicrobial activity  is an important part of the plant defense repertoire to limit the spread of pathogens  <cit> . successful phytopathogens must be able to circumvent the toxic effects of antimicrobial plant compounds. an important resistance mechanism of bacteria against plant-borne antimicrobials involves efflux of these compounds by so-called multidrug transporters. among the transporter families containing multidrug efflux transporters, the resistance-nodulation-cell division  family has been identified as the most relevant in terms of resistance to clinically important agents in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . members of the rnd family are able to recognize and expel a broad range of antimicrobials from the cell  <cit> . the rnd-type efflux pump acrab has been shown to be involved in virulence of e. amylovora conferring resistance to plant-borne antimicrobial compounds like apple phytoalexins  <cit> .

the functional rnd-type efflux pump is a tripartite complex, consisting of the rnd-type transporter protein located in the inner membrane, a periplasmic membrane protein, and an outer membrane channel  <cit> . the inner membrane rnd transporter is a homotrimer that uses the proton gradient as an energy source  <cit> . associated with this homotrimeric structure is the so-called ‘rotating mechanism’, a conformational change in the periplasmic core domain to export drug molecules  <cit> .

however, not all members of the rnd family follow a homotrimeric organization. for example, the rnd-family efflux system mdtabc from e. coli possesses two different rnd transporters, mdtb and mdtc, which are co-transcribed in an operon with the membrane fusion protein mdta. it has previously been shown that the functional pump consists of a heteromultimeric unit formed by two subunits of mdtb and one subunit of mdtc  <cit> . furthermore, it has been suggested that mdtc is involved in binding and transport of drugs and that mdtb presumably induces the conformational change needed for transport using the proton translocation as an energy source  <cit> .

previous genetic studies have demonstrated that the deletion of the heteromultimeric rnd pump mdtabc abolishes the resistance of e. coli and salmonella enterica to β-lactams, novobiocin, sds, and bile salts  <cit> . moreover, mdtabc has been implicated in detoxification of heavy metals, in particular, in resistance to zinc, copper and tungstate  <cit> .

in e. coli, the expression of the multidrug efflux pump mdtabc is regulated by two stress response systems, bae and cpx. the baesr and cpxarp two-component signal transduction systems respond to damage of the cell envelope; however, they differ with regard to specific inducers. the baesr regulon responds to a wide range of environmental stresses, including spheroplast formation, overexpression of the papg pilin under conditions leading to misfolding, and exposure to indole, tannins, flavonoids, tungstate, and zinc  <cit> . the small core regulon of baesr includes the baesr two-component system itself, the rnd-type transporters acrd and mdtabc, and the periplasmic chaperone spy  <cit> . the cpxra regulon of e. coli contains hundreds of genes, including periplasmic protein folding and degrading factors, peptidoglycan metabolic enzymes, inner membrane proteins and regulators, and envelope-localized protein complexes, such as pili and flagella  <cit> . the cpx system comprises the sensor histidine kinase cpxa, the cytoplasmic response regulator cpxr, and cpxp, a periplasmic inhibitor of cpxa  <cit> . the cpx pathway is activated by a variety of stresses within the bacterial cell envelope, e.g., alkaline ph, alterations to the composition of the inner membrane, overexpression of misfolded envelope proteins, and adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces sensed by the lipoprotein nlpe  <cit> . hirakawa et al.  <cit>  reported that the overexpression of baer and cpxr causes up-regulation of rnd pumps acrd and mdtabc in e. coli. analysis of the induction of multidrug transporter genes by indole revealed that the cpxr-mediated induction of acrd and mdtabc genes depends on the baesr two-component system  <cit> . these results indicate that baer is a primary regulator, and cpxr enhances the effect of baer.

the aim of this study was to characterize the heteromultimeric rnd-type multidrug efflux pumps mdtabc and mdtuvw from e. amylovora ea <dig> and to determine the role of the two-component system regulators baer and cpxr in regulation of these efflux systems.

RESULTS
computational analysis of rnd-type transporters from e. amylovora ea1189
analysis of the genome sequence of e. amylovora revealed the presence of two, hitherto not characterized, operons encoding heterotrimer-type rnd-type efflux pumps. both show homology to the mdtabc operon of e. coli. the mdtabc genes of e. coli encode an rnd system that is unusual in that it contains two different rnd pump genes, mdtb and mdtc, in addition to the membrane fusion protein gene, mdta <cit> . one of the heterotrimer-type rnd efflux systems of e. amylovora shows a high degree of homology to the e. coli mdtabc transporter as depicted in the phylogenetic tree in figure  <dig>  we accordingly propose to name the operon encoding this transporter as mdtabc. the second, more distantly related operon was named mdtuvw.

a sequence alignment showed that the rnd pump mdtb from e. amylovora ea <dig> shares 59% identity with mdtv and 81% identity with mdtb from e. coli . mdtv shares only 61% identity with mdtb from e. coli. the rnd pump mdtc from e. amylovora shares 54% identity with mdtw and 74% identity with mdtc from e. coli. mdtw shares 56% identity with mdtc from e. coli. furthermore, e. coli possesses an additional gene, icet , encoding an iron citrate efflux transporter of the major facilitator superfamily, within the mdtabc operon  <cit> . no homologue of the icet is present in the genome of e. amylovora.

analysis of the up- and downstream regions flanking the mdtabc operons from e. amylovora and e. coli revealed the presence of the baesr genes located downstream of the mdtabc operons in both organisms . the two-component system baesr is involved in a unique envelope stress response in e. coli <cit> .

topological analysis of the rnd proteins mdtb, mdtc, mdtv, and mdtw from e. amylovora using the topcons software  <cit>  predicted  <dig> transmembrane-spanning domains  and two large periplasmic loops between tmd  <dig> and  <dig> and tmd  <dig> and  <dig> for all four transporters . this transmembrane organization is typical for members of the rnd family  <cit> .

phenotypic characterization of the mdtabc and mdtuvw mutants
in order to investigate the role of the rnd-type multidrug efflux pumps mdtabc and mdtuvw in antibiotic resistance and to identify pump-specific substrates, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the wild type and the corresponding mutants were performed. however, deletion of the mdtabc and mdtuvw operon, respectively, resulted in no changes in sensitivity to all tested antimicrobial agents including plant-derived antimicrobials, antibiotics, dyes, and heavy metals .

a
amic values were determined by the 2-fold dilution assay in three or more independent experiments with similar results. boldface numbers indicate a more than 2-fold higher mic. nd, not determined.

mic values were determined from an e. amylovora wild-type strain, mdtabc mutant, and mdtuvw mutant, as well as from an acrb mutant ea1189- <dig> complemented with mdtabc-overexpression plasmid pbluesk.mdtabc or mdtuvw-overexpression plasmid pblueks.mdtuvw-ext.

effect of mdtabc and mdtuvw overexpression on multidrug resistance in an acrb-deficient mutant of e. amylovora
since disruption of the mdtabc and mdtuvw operons did not cause hypersusceptibility to any of the tested compounds, possibly due to their low expression during cellular growth or due to the activity of the highly expressed acrab efflux pump, overexpression of the mdtabc and mdtuvw operons from high-copy plasmids in an acrb-deficient mutant was achieved. different plasmids expressing the rnd operons under control of three different promoters were generated: lac promoter , native promoter , and dual promoter . to investigate the role of the rnd pumps in β-lactam resistance, the bla gene of the high-copy plasmid pbluescript ii ks and pbluescript ii sk used for overexpression of the mdtabc and mdtuvw operons was replaced by a sm/sp resistance cassette . all constructs were mobilized into the acrb-deficient mutant ea1189- <dig> and the sensitivity of the transformants to various substrates was determined .

our initial data indicated that expression of the rnd operons from different promoters had a strong influence on the mic values. therefore, we utilized qrt-pcr to analyze the mrna expression from the different constructs and found that the expression of the mdtabc operon driven by plac  was  <dig> times higher than the expression driven by the dual promoter . interestingly, there was almost no increased expression of the mdtabc operon from its native promoter . although we detected minor mic changes after expression of the mdtabc operon from its native promoter and dual promoter, respectively, expression driven by plac resulted in the highest changes in mic values. in contrast, the expression levels of the mdtuvw operon from plac or from its native promoter were similar low . the expression of the mdtuvw operon from the dual promoter was much higher , however, did not result in mic changes. interestingly, only with the expression from the native promoter, we were able to detect minor changes in mic values.

the expression of mdtabc from a high-copy vector under the control of the lac promoter, in an acrb-deficient mutant, resulted in increased resistance to tannin , apigenin , daidzein , kaempferol , fusidic acid , josamycin , novobiocin , bile salts  and silver nitrate  . the expression of mdtuvw from a high-copy vector under the control of its native promoter increased the mics of several flavonoids including apigenin , daidzein , genistein , kaempferol , luteolin , naringenin , and orobol , and of the antibiotics fusidic acid , novobiocin  and clotrimazole  .

rnd-type efflux pump expression during cellular growth
the relative mrna transcript abundance of mdta and mdtu from e. amylovora ea <dig> during cellular growth was determined by quantitative rt-pcr. therefore, total rna was isolated at distinct optical densities  and the expression normalized to the highest expression of each transcript. the mrna transcript levels of mdta and mdtu were constant but low during growth in lb medium as determined by ct values . analysis of transcriptional fusions between the promoter regions of the efflux pumps and the reporter gene egfp supported these results. fluorescence measurements showed that the activity of the mdtabc and mdtuvw promoters were 3- to 5-fold lower than the activity of the acra promoter throughout growth in lb broth.

effect of substrate exposure on mdtabc and mdtuvw expression
to investigate whether antimicrobials effect the expression of mdtabc or mdtuvw in e. amylovora, transcriptional fusions between the mdtabc upstream region and mdtuvw upstream region, respectively, to the egfp gene were constructed, yielding plasmids pbbr.mdtabc-pro.egfp and pbbr.mdtuvw-pro.egfp.

antimicrobial compounds were added to the plasmid-harboring cells by the 2-fold dilution method in 96-well plates and egfp fluorescence was determined after 24 hours. only fluorescence values from substrate concentrations that did not inhibit bacterial growth were considered. potential inducers of gene expression , showing higher fluorescence than the remaining dataset, were identified as fusaric acid for the mdtabc promoter and copper sulphate for the mdtuvw promoter .

in addition, we analyzed the expression of mdta and mdtu by qrt-pcr after 2 hours induction with several antimicrobials. tested compounds were phloretin, naringenin, mycricetin, methanolic and acetonic apple extract, indole, paraquat, phenolic acids, gallic acid, tannin, indole-3-acetic acid, and the metals iron, copper, zinc, and tungstate. our data showed an induction of mdta by tannin  and tungstate , while expression of mdtu was not induced by the tested compounds . furthermore, we observed that the regulatory gene baes was  <dig> -fold induced by tannin .

regulation of the rnd-type pumps mdtabc and mdtuvw in e. amylovora
several studies suggest a connection between cell envelope stress responses and expression of multidrug efflux systems. in e. coli, the two-component signal transduction systems baesr and cpxarp respond to damage of the cell envelope and have been shown to regulate the expression of drug exporter genes including the rnd efflux pump mdtabc  <cit> . since a blast search revealed the presence of homologous systems in the genome sequence of e. amylovora , it prompted us to investigate whether the response regulators baer and cpxr control expression of the mdtabc and mdtuvw transporters in e. amylovora ea <dig> 

to test whether baer or cpxr bind to the promoter regions of mdtabc or mdtuvw in vitro, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  was performed. dna fragments used in the emsa were the cy5-labeled upstream regions of mdtabc , mdtuvw  and as control, a fragment located within the tolc gene . the dna fragments were incubated with increasing amounts of purified baer or cpxr protein in the presence of nonspecific competitor dna  . the purified baer protein showed binding to the upstream region of mdtabc with increasing concentrations . however, no interaction between baer and the mdtuvw promoter region was observed. furthermore, no interaction between cpxr and the mdtabc or mdtuvw promoter region was detected. in vitro phosphorylation of the purified protein using acetyl phosphate did not lead to a binding of cpxr to one of the dna fragments. phosphorylation of baer enhanced the binding to the mdtabc promoter region about 2-fold.

induction of mdtabc and mdtuvw expression by the response regulators baer and cpxr
owing to the interaction between the mdtabc promoter region and baer in the emsa, we investigated whether overexpression of baer and cpxr may induce the expression of efflux pump genes in vivo. therefore, baer and cpxr were cloned under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter into plasmid pbad <dig> and the constructs were mobilized into ea <dig> wild-type cells. analysis of the expression levels using qrt-pcr identified a 13-fold induction of baer and a 49-fold induction of cpxr in ea <dig> cells harboring the respective plasmids . we have previously reported that overexpression of baer induces the expression of the rnd pump gene acrd about 4-fold, while the expression of acra and tolc was not affected  <cit> . in this study we found that overexpression of baer increased the expression of mdtabc more than 20-fold . however, no induction of the mdtuvw pump was observed. the qrt-pcr results correlate well with the observed interaction of baer in the emsa, indicating a specific binding of baer to the promoter region of mdtabc.

in contrast, overexpression of the cpxr response regulator did not alter the expression of any multidrug efflux pump gene in e. amylovora .

transcriptional analysis of mdta and mdtu in planta
in order to analyze the expression of mdta and mdtu in planta, ea <dig> was inoculated into shoot tips of apple rootstocks mm <dig> as well as onto immature pear fruit slices. bacteria were re-isolated from immature pear fruit slices 12 hours after inoculation and  <dig>   <dig> and 7 days, respectively, after inoculation from apple shoot tips. infected plant tissue was macerated and total rna isolated from recovered cells to determine the transcript abundances of mdta and mdtu by quantitative rt-pcr. rt-pcr signals of recovered bacteria were compared with rt-pcr signals of ea <dig> cells grown in lb broth to an od <dig> of  <dig>  . analysis of relative fold changes in mrna transcripts showed that the expression of mdta and mdtu increased  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, on immature pear fruits. our results further demonstrate that expression of mdta was high throughout the seven monitored days , which might also be due to the very low expression in lb broth during the cell cycle. in connection with the mdta expression, the mdtu expression was about 3-fold induced within the first three days after infection of apple rootstock and returned to the base level after seven days.

virulence of e. amylovora efflux pump mutants on apple rootstocks and immature pear fruits
apple rootstocks mm <dig> were used to monitor the development of disease symptoms after infection with e. amylovora ea <dig> and corresponding rnd-type efflux pump mutants ea <dig> Δmdtabc and ea <dig> Δmdtuvw. seven days after infection all injected shoots showed typical disease symptoms including the shepherd’s crook-like bending, tissue necrosis and ooze formation. in order to study the establishment of bacterial populations within the tissue, samples were taken  <dig>   <dig> and 7 day post inoculation and cfus per stem determined. three days after inoculation the wild type and the mutants showed similar growth. however, after seven days the population size of the mdtabc and mdtuvw mutant was 5- and 10-times lower, respectively, than the population size of the wild type. these results indicate that both rnd-type pumps contribute to the ability of e. amylovora to survive and multiply in apple rootstock mm <dig> .

since e. amylovora is also able to infect pears, we used immature pear fruits to study the impact of the rnd-pumps acrb, mdtabc and mdtuvw on virulence. fruits were infected with the wild type and the mutants and incubated at 28°c for 6 days and at 18°c for 14 days. however, except for the acrb mutant, no differences between the wild type and the mutants were observed .

discussion
the highly virulent plant pathogen e. amylovora ea <dig> possesses four rnd-type multidrug efflux transporters: acrab, acrd, mdtabc, and mdtuvw. acrab has previously been shown to be involved in resistance against a broad range of structurally unrelated compounds including plant-borne antimicrobials  <cit> . acrd has been characterized as efflux transporter conferring resistance to a limited number of amphiphilic compounds  <cit> . the rnd transporter acrb and acrd exist as homotrimers in the inner membrane and conduct drug transport by the functionally rotating mechanism  <cit> . the genome sequence of e. amylovora contains two additional operons encoding rnd-type efflux transporters, mdtabc and mdtuvw, with homology to the mdtabc transporter from e. coli. the heterotrimeric mdtb2c complex is the functional form of the e. coli transporter. mdtc is likely involved in substrate binding and transport, whereas the two copies of mdtb use proton translocation as energy source to induce the conformational change needed for drug transport  <cit> . this work aimed to characterize the heterotrimeric rnd transporters mdtabc and mdtuvw from e. amylovora ea <dig>  analyze the regulation of their expression, and identify their role in virulence.

since deletion of the mdtabc or mdtuvw operon did not alter the cellular drug resistance profile of the respective e. amylovora mutants , we overexpressed the efflux operons in the e. amylovora mutant ea1189- <dig> defective in the major multidrug efflux pump acrb. overexpression of the mdtabc transporter in e. amylovora ea1189- <dig> led to increased resistance towards three flavonoids , tannin, fusidic acid, josamycin, novobiocin, bile salts and silver nitrate. on the other hand, overexpression of the mdtuvw transporter led to increased resistance towards several flavonoids , fusidic acid, novobiocin and clotrimazole. additionally, we observed a slight increase in resistance of the mdtabc-overexpressing strain towards acetonic apple leaf extracts . the mdtabc and mdtuvw pumps from e. amylovora share overlapping substrate specificities with the mdtabc pumps from e. coli and s. enterica <cit> . shared substrates are novobiocin, bile salts and flavonoids suggesting that these compounds may resemble the natural substrates of the pumps.

the intrinsic resistance of e. amylovora towards flavonoids and tannin, mediated by the efflux pumps mdtabc and mdtuvw, is interesting since an increased production of polyphenols has been identified as defense mechanism of plants against fungal and bacterial infections  <cit> . flavonoids occur widely in plants, are biologically important and are chemically diverse groups of secondary metabolites that possess a wide range of biological activities, including defense against pathogens  <cit> . inducible biosynthesis of 3-deoxyflavonoid has been demonstrated to be accompanied by increased resistance of apple and pear leaves to fire blight infections  <cit> . to survive and multiply in its host plants, e. amylovora must be able to circumvent the toxic effect of these antimicrobial phytoalexins. we have previously demonstrated that the rnd-type transporter acrab is involved in resistance toward apple phytoalexins and that it is required for successful colonization of the host plant  <cit> . mutation of acrb in e. amylovora dramatically reduced tolerance to apple phytoalexins phloretin, naringenin, quercetin, and -catechin. herein, we report that the rnd-type efflux transporters mdtabc and mdtuvw are also involved in secretion of antibacterial plant polyphenols, such as flavonoids and tannin. furthermore, inactivation of the rnd-type pumps mdtabc and mdtuvw, respectively, resulted in a reduced ability of e. amylovora to survive and multiply within apple rootstock mm <dig> . the population size of the mdtabc mutant was 3-fold lower than the population size of the wild type seven days after infection. the mdtuvw mutant showed an even greater reduction in its ability to multiply within apple rootstock reaching a 10-fold lower population size. in several bacterial pathosystems, virulence factors are induced by plant-derived signals. expression analysis by qrt-pcr revealed an about 3-fold induction of the mdtu gene in the early infection phase from day  <dig> to  <dig> after infection of apple tissue with e. amylovora . in contrast, the mdta gene showed an about 50-fold increase in transcript abundance during growth of e. amylovora in apple rootstock. we identified tannin as an inducer of mdta expression and as substrate of the mdtabc transporter . condensed tannins, also called proanthocyanidins, are polymers formed by the condensation of flavonoids  <cit> . it has previously been demonstrated that the multidrug transporter mdtabc from e. coli was up-regulated in the presence of acacia mearnsii tannin extract  <cit> . in addition to mdtabc, condensed tannins induced also other members of the envelope stress response regulated by the baesr two-component system in e. coli <cit> . indeed, the baesr operon was also found to be up-regulated  in e. amylovora during growth in medium containing tannin . the response regulator baer was shown to positively regulate the expression of the mdtabcd locus in e. coli and s. enterica, leading to increased resistance to novobiocin, deoxycholate, sds and β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> .

the response regulator baer was shown to bind to the promoter region of the mdtabcd locus in e. coli and s. enterica <cit> . in this study, we investigated whether baer is able to bind to the promoter regions of mdtabc and mdtuvw in e. amylovora. our results show that baer binds to the promoter region of mdtabc but not to the mdtuvw promoter . furthermore, overexpression of baer induced the expression of the rnd-type efflux pumps acrd and mdtabc .

another envelope stress response, the cpx two-component system, has been associated with the regulation of the mdtabc transporter in e. coli <cit> . in order to analyze whether cpxr is involved in the expression of the rnd-type pumps mdtabc and mdtuvw in e. amylovora ea <dig>  we tested whether cpxr is able to bind to the promoter regions of the transporter genes . our data suggest that cpxr does not directly interact with the promoter regions of mdtabc and mdtuvw. moreover, overexpression of cpxr did not induce the expression of the rnd pumps mdtabc and mdtuvw .

we could demonstrate that flavonoids are natural substrates of the mdtabc and mdtuvw transporter from e. amylovora. the expression of these transporters was induced during infection of apple rootstock. condensed tannins  induced the expression of the two-component system baesr which directly regulates the expression of the mdtabc pump in e. amylovora. several flavonoids have been reported to possess antibacterial activities  <cit> . their direct antibacterial activity may be attributable to different mechanisms including inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, damage of cytoplasmic membrane function, inhibition of energy metabolism, inhibition of cell wall synthesis and inhibition of membrane synthesis  <cit> . flavonoids cause stresses to the bacterial envelope. therefore, it is not surprising that tannins induce the envelope stress response baesr in e. amylovora.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of the present study was the characterization of the rnd-type multidrug efflux pumps mdtabc and mdtuvw from the plant pathogen e. amylovora, causing fire blight disease of apple, pear, and other members of the rosaceae family. our results suggest that mdtabc and mdtuvw play a role in survival and multiplication of e. amylovora in apple rootstocks as well as in the cell envelope stress response of the plant pathogen. the expression of both operons encoding these rnd pumps was up-regulated in planta. we could identify the plant polyphenol tannin as inducer of mdtabc expression. the mdtabc- and mdtuvw-deficient mutants reached lower population sizes than the wild type in apple rootstock suggesting a role of the efflux pumps in resistance towards antimicrobial plant compounds, such as flavonoids. moreover, we were able to demonstrate that the expression of mdtabc is activated by the two-component system baesr which is involved in the regulation of cell envelope stress responses.
