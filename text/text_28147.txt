BACKGROUND
infections of the udder  are a key disease for dairy animals  <cit> . the course of the infection and its resolution depend heavily on the species of the invading pathogen  <cit> . escherichia coli  and other gram-negative bacteria very often cause heavy inflammation of the udder and severe clinical symptoms . the vigorous immune response towards those pathogens is driven by the massive, but transient synthesis and secretion of master cytokines  in the udder  <cit> ). these infections are often self-healing by eradicating the pathogens. staphylococcus aureus  and other gram-positive germs however tend to elicit only mild inflammations  due to belated and diminished induction of cytokine synthesis. these infections may become persistent and chronic  <cit> .

primary cultures of bovine mammary epithelial cells  have been used in a variety of studies as models for analysing the molecular causes underpinning the pathogen-species dependence of the immune response in the udder. we and others found consistently that pbmec properly recapitulate the pathogen specific differences recorded from experimentally infected cows. they responded quickly after a challenge through heat inactivated e. coli pathogens or lipopolysaccharide  with a strong induction of key immune genes. this was always transient for most of the cytokine- and chemokine-encoding genes. the response towards similar preparations of s. aureus or lipoteichioc acid  was always belated and much weaker . pathogen-specific differentiated induction of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells  factor complex  <cit>  in the pbmec was identified as a major cause for these qualitative and quantitative differences in the immune response. challenging the pbmec with heat killed e. coli, but not with s. aureus activated the nf-κb factor complex, albeit that both pathogens would trigger toll-like receptor  <dig>  or tlr <dig> mediated nf-κb activation in other cell types, such as hek <dig> cells  <cit> .

however, other groups using in principle the same cell model found that s. aureus would elicit an immune response as quickly as – or even faster than – e. coli of eventually almost the same intensity . moreover, the e. coli stimulus did not cause a peak-shaped and transient induction of cytokine gene expression but rather resulted in a sustained induction, notably of tnf, il1b and of the chemokine cxcl <dig>  <cit> . these differences in modelling the pathogen–species specific immune response of the udder using pbmec are to date unexplained. they raise doubts about eventually biased interpretations of key mechanisms governing the pathogen specific immune response in the udder.

a comparison of the methods applied in these studies revealed as a main difference the addition of 10 % fetal calf serum  to the growth medium of pbmec during the stimulation period. those groups having found the fast and transient response towards e. coli and lps always stimulated the pbmec in the presence of 10 % fcs, while all the other studies reporting a strong and transient response towards s. aureus and a delayed response towards e. coli deprived the cell growth medium of fcs during the challenge.

depriving cells from serum deeply impacts on cell metabolism, cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis . serum starvation is a widely used condition for the analysis of immune responsiveness of model cells. however, it has already been shown in the hek <dig> reconstitution system of tlr <dig> signalling that the lps mediated tlr <dig> activation is dampened and retarded in fcs free stimulation medium due to the concomitant lack of lps binding protein   <cit> . moreover, it was found in murine raw <dig> macrophages that the addition of fcs accelerated the tlr <dig> mediated response to lps  <cit> . the quality of fcs was identified as a key variable in the pathogen dependent interferon γ induction of human t-cells  <cit> . withdrawal of fcs was shown to massively activate the basal level of nf-κb factors in cos cells, suggesting the existence of an inhibitor of nf-κb activation in fetal calf serum, acting through g-protein coupled receptors  <cit> . base line expression of the master cytokine interleukin  <dig>  was found to be strongly increased by supplementing the growth medium of bone marrow cells with fcs  <cit> . based on qualitative western blot data, a recent report suggests that some s. aureus mediated nf-κb activation may occur in pbmec stimulated in serum free, but not in serum containing medium  <cit> . these different lines of evidence all suggest that serum starvation might impact on the recognition of different pathogen species by the host cell. hence, the composition of the growth and stimulation medium might crucially influence key mechanisms of immune induction in the mec.

we therefore analysed here the influence of fcs upon the pathogen-species specific immune response of pbmec. in addition, we evaluated the effect of milk proteins upon pbmec activation, since mec are in vivo exposed to milk. we found that the presence of 10 % fcs is necessary for a swift and strong induction of the expression of cytokine and chemokine encoding genes in pbmec after stimulation with e. coli, while significantly attenuating the response towards s. aureus. addition of milk constituents quenched the response of these cells towards both pathogens, but strongest towards s. aureus.

RESULTS
replica experiments yielded in principle concordant results but with slightly different kinetics
we monitored the transcript levels of genes encoding the immediate early immune response factors  tnf, il1a, il1b, il <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and ccl <dig> to analyse the early pathogen specific response in primary cultures of bovine mec . transcript levels of genes encoding the inducible nitric oxide synthase , β defensin lap and serum amyloid a <dig>  served as markers for the secondary, late pathogen specific response and we are referring to them as group b genes. transcript levels from the gene encoding tristetraprolin  served as a control for the activation of mrna decay  <cit> .

the data set to evaluate the effect of different compositions of the stimulation medium upon the pathogen-specific immune response was derived from biological replica experiments  using pbmec obtained from at least two different cows. the pbmec were routinely grown in rpmi  <dig> medium supplemented with 10 % fcs . stimulation of pbmec was carried out by either adding 30 μg/ml of the heat inactivated pathogen particles  directly to cells grown in sm <dig> or after replacing the growth medium by rpmi  <dig> without fcs , or rpmi  <dig>  supplemented with 10 mg/ml of milk proteins . the concentration of bacterial proteins added represents approximately  <dig> pathogen particles per ml . applying this challenge dose of both pathogens in sm <dig> resulted in a strong activation of the bovine tlr <dig> receptor in the hek <dig> reconstitution system of tlr-signalling , similarly as previously reported  <cit> .

the induction kinetics of tnf-encoding mrna levels exemplified the qualitatively good agreement of replica experiments . the kinetics revealed that the response was somewhat faster and more intense in experiment  <dig>  e. coli increased the tnf concentration in sm <dig> by  <dig> fold in experiment  <dig> and by  <dig> fold in experiment  <dig>  similarly, the tnf concentration was increased in response to s. aureus by  <dig> fold in sm <dig> in experiment  <dig> and by  <dig> fold in experiment  <dig>  differences in induction rates and kinetics resulted in a considerable variance of mean values for relative mrna levels in both experiments. however, the following differences of the pathogen-specific induction of the candidate genes were concordantly found in replica experiments.

withdrawal of fcs quenched and retarded the e. coli induced expression of group a genes
withdrawal of fcs significantly belated the e. coli induced expression of immediate early genes. for example, challenging with e. coli in sm <dig> caused swiftly a steep  peak shaped increase in the tnf concentration already three hours after the challenge. in contrast, applying the same challenge in sm <dig> caused a slower, yet steady increase of that mrna concentration, resulting in a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold increase at 24 h after the challenge . similarly, the maximum mrna concentration of all other group a genes was reached 3 h after challenging in sm <dig> and then declined down to approximately 20 % of that peak value at 24 h post challenge . in contrast, all these genes achieved their maximum mrna concentration not earlier than 24 h after stimulation with e. coli in sm <dig> fig.  <dig> composition of the challenge medium influences extent and kinetic of pathogen-specific induction of tnf and nos2a expression. a

withdrawal of fcs reduced the extent of e. coli induced expression, particularly of group a genes. the maximum mrna concentrations of these genes after e. coli stimulation in sm <dig> was on average only about 1/3rd of that recorded in sm <dig> .

the fcs related influence upon the e. coli induced expression of the secondary response group b genes was not so strong, neither regarding kinetic nor extent of the modulation.

withdrawal of fcs strongly enhanced extent, but not the kinetic of s. aureus induced immune genes expression
stimulation with s. aureus in sm <dig> strongly increased the maximum mrna concentration of group a genes , on average more than fivefold. this was similar to the average of the quantitative effect upon group b gene expression.

the composition of the stimulation medium did not alter the time course of gene induction during stimulation with s. aureus. maximum mrna concentrations of immediate early  genes were always reached three hours after stimulation, irrespective of the presence of fcs in the stimulation medium. however, only in sm <dig> was their peak shaped induction very obvious, due to their poor quantitative induction in sm <dig> 

these data together show that presence or absence of 10 % fcs in the stimulation medium multiplied quantitatively into an almost twenty fold difference in the extent of the e. coli vs. s. aureus specific induction of the expression of cyto- and chemokine encoding genes.

milk proteins generally reduced the pathogen-related induction of almost all genes
milk samples taken from an individual cow reflect the actual condition inside the udder at the time of sampling. these conditions might be very variable. moreover, we realized previously in a study unrelated to the present context, that a short temperature treatment  known as pasteurization grossly alters the immune stimulatory properties of milk. we found that raw milk, but not pasteurized milk significantly increased the base line expression of immune genes, such as tnfα or lap . hence, the use of cow’s milk is difficult to standardize. in addition, it proved to be a lengthy process to legally import lyophilisates of those milk samples from healthy cows across the borders of countries. we therefore used for the study here a commercially worldwide available milk powder as a supplement for the stimulation medium.

initial experiments showed that addition of milk powder, re-dissolved in rpmi  <dig> diminished the pathogen-induced response of all indicator genes in a dose dependent fashion and also increased the baseline transcription of several group a genes in non-challenged control cultures . we therefore stimulated the cells in rpmi  <dig> to which 10 mg/ml of re-dissolved milk proteins had been added  and recorded the base line expression from control cultures at any time point.

addition of milk proteins consistently increased the basal transcript level of the marker genes over time but with different intensities for individual genes. for example, the highest increase was found for il1b  and saa <dig>  while for il1a only a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold increase was detected . for comparison, we found that just removing the fcs from the medium  had a weaker effect upon the base line expression of those genes, with the noteworthy exception that removal of serum reduced the base line expression of cxcl <dig>  il1a and il <dig>  the base line expression of all genes remained stable in sm <dig> over the entire 24 h of the experiment in sm <dig> 

that strong effect of milk over time on the base line expression of cytokine encoding genes resulted in a diminished proportion of the pathogen related increase in the mrna concentrations in sm milk . stimulation with e. coli in sm milk resulted in a similar stimulation pattern of immune gene expression as recorded in sm <dig> . this refers to both, extent and kinetic of increased mrna abundance post challenge. in contrast, stimulation with e. coli in sm <dig> or sm milk differentially modulated for several genes the kinetic of their induction. key difference in this regard was in sm milk the lack or only marginal down regulation  of the mrnas, similar as seen in sm <dig> 

challenging the pbmec with s. aureus in sm milk did not alter the kinetic of modulated gene expression compared to s. aureus stimulation in both other media . it resulted in the same very weak increase in the mrna concentration of group a and group b genes as recorded after stimulating with s. aureus in sm <dig> .

s. aureus strain specific differences in the capacity to induce immune gene expression in pbmec can only be recorded in sm0
a previous study reported that different s. aureus isolates from cases of mastitis differentially induced immune gene expression in pbmec  <cit> . this study had been conducted stimulating with live bacteria for three hours and using a fcs depleted stimulation medium . unexpectedly, we could subsequently not find any statistically significant difference in the immune induction capacities of various s. aureus isolates from cases of bovine mastitis . these isolates had previously been shown to be genetically quite diverse  <cit> . however, our studies had been conducted using sm <dig>  we had already seen in pilot experiments that co-culturing live s. aureus <dig> with pbmec in sm <dig> for 1 h did not improve the stimulatory properties of this strain, neither regarding the induced expression of immune genes nor the activation of nf-κb . hence, it was unlikely that incubation with heat killed rather than live s. aureus pathogens would be causative for our always recorded uniform low capacity of s. aureus to induce immune gene expression in pbmec. we therefore compared now in some experiments properties of the quite commonly used s. aureus strain newbould  <dig> . stimulation with s. aureus  <dig> in sm <dig> increased the mrna concentration of all group a and b genes more than  <dig> fold over the level as induced by n <dig> . in contrast, the induction capacity of both strains was virtually the same in sm <dig> or in sm milk.table  <dig> comparison of the induction capacity of s. aureus strain  <dig> vs. n <dig> in different stimulation media

e. coli activated nf-κb in all media, but s. aureus only marginally in sm0
we analysed the influence of the different stimulation media upon the activation of the nf-κb factor complex in order to search for mechanisms underpinning the improved induction of immune gene expression by s. aureus in sm <dig>  nf-κb activation is an integrating parameter for tlr-signalling. we therefore transfected a nf-κb transcription factor driven luciferase expressing reporter gene into pbmec and found that e. coli activated nf-κb factors ~ <dig> fold in all three media while s. aureus  <dig> did so only in sm <dig> and only to a small extent . s. aureus activated the level of active nf-κb factors by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold in sm <dig> . analysis of the nf-κb inducing capacity in pbmec of four other s. aureus strains in sm <dig> revealed that they all failed to activate nf-κb factors in the fcs containing growth medium sm <dig>  even co-culturing for 1 h live s. aureus <dig> pathogens with the pbmec in sm <dig> did not significantly induce the level of active nf-κb factors . addition of milk proteins allowed for a highly significant nf-κb activation after stimulation with e. coli, but virtually no induction after stimulation with s. aureus <dig>  addition of milk proteins significantly increased the basal activity of nf-κb factors in the unstimulated control cultures during the 24 h incubation period by  <dig>  fold .fig.  <dig> influence of medium composition on pathogen or pamp mediated nf-κb activation in pbmec. a e. coli, but not s. aureus activates nf-κb in all media. pbmec were transiently transfected with the nf-κb driven luciferase reporter gene and subsequently challenged for 24 h with 30 μg/ of heat killed pathogens in the media as indicated and the luciferase activity was measured from lysates . mean values  from five experiments  for sm <dig> and sm <dig>  and two biological replica experiments for sm milk. each experiment was assayed in triplicate . b

we analysed in western blots on a time line  the influence of fcs upon s. aureus induced degradation of the nf-κb inhibitor protein iκbα serving as a second parameter for nf-κb activation. stimulation with e. coli resulted in a degradation of iκbα in both media, sm <dig> and sm <dig>  while this was not apparent after stimulation with s. aureus . the e. coli challenge in sm <dig> resulted already after 30 min in a very clearly visible degradation of the iκbα factor, and its re-synthesis was apparent after 2 h. this process was retarded after stimulation in sm <dig>  complying well with the delayed induction of the expression of our indicator genes in sm <dig>  in contrast, iκbα was not degraded by s. aureus stimulation, neither if applied in sm <dig> nor in sm <dig>  interestingly, neither of the pathogens degraded this factor in sm milk .

fcs modulated the effect of tlr4-, but not of tlr2- mediated signalling
we wondered if the impaired immune stimulation of our pbmec cells by s. aureus applied in sm <dig> might be due to fcs-mediated impaired ligand recognition by the tlr <dig> receptor. the synthetic lipopeptides pam2csk <dig> and pam3csk <dig> are widely used as mimetic for bacterial di- or tri-acetylated lipoproteins. they are ligands for tlr2/ <dig> and tlr2/ <dig> heterodimers, respectively  <cit> . it was previously shown that pam2csk <dig> is a much more potent activator of cxcl <dig> expression in pbmec than pam3csk <dig>  <cit> . we compared the efficacy of both lipopeptides to stimulate the tlr <dig> receptor in the hek <dig> cells  in order to find physiologically comparable dosages. based on these data we stimulated the pbmec cultures in sm <dig> and sm <dig> with 10 ng/ml of pam2csk <dig> and 100 ng/ml of pam3csk <dig> and included a highly purified lps preparation from e. coli  <dig> as a pure tlr <dig> ligand  <cit> . both model substances for lipopeptides stimulated very strongly and quickly the expression of tnf in both stimulation media  similarly as it was found for other group a genes . stimulation with pam2csk <dig> increased the maximum tnf concentration to approximately the level as found after stimulation with e. coli in sm <dig>  the same applied to the nos2a mrna concentration. lps, on the other hand stimulated the expression faster and stronger in sm <dig> than in sm <dig> fig.  <dig> dissection of the influence of fcs upon tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> mediated pathogen recognition. a tlr <dig>  but not tlr <dig> signalling activates immune gene expression irrespective of fcs presence. pbmec were challenges in sm <dig> or sm <dig> with synthetic lipopetides  as tlr <dig> ligands or purified lps  as tlr <dig> ligand. same experimental setting as in fig.  <dig>  the mrna concentration  of tnf or nos2a was measured at different times after challenge . data are mean values and sem from two biological replica experiments, each assayed in duplicate; *, p <  <dig>  vs. unstimulated control . b purified pamps activate nf-κb in pbmec irrespective of fcs supplementation. pbmec were transfected with the nf-κb reporter expressing vector  and challenged for 24 h with purified lps or pam2csk <dig>  or 100 ng/ml of pam3csk <dig>  mean values of increased luciferase activity over that of unstimulated controls  from two  independent experiments, each assayed in triplicate. different superscript letters indicate significant  difference from each other and from the unstimulated control. c lysates from shattered s. aureus do not strongly activate nf-κb in pbmec. same as b, but comparing in pbmec the nf-κb activation through heat killed bacteria  with that caused by supernatants  from ribolyser crushed heat killed pathogens from s. aureus strains n <dig> and rf <dig> to that of e. coli. protein concentrations applied for the respective challenge are given below the columns. each condition was assayed in triplicate. superscript letters  indicate significant  difference between the column means and from the unstimulated controls



all three purified pamps  activated nf-κb factors in pbmec irrespective of the addition of fcs .

these data together reveal proper, ligand dependent signalling of tlr <dig> in mec irrespective of the presence of fcs. they also show that the tlr <dig> receptor was activated by its specific ligand irrespective of fcs presence, but that physiological consequences of tlr <dig> activation  were indeed modulated by fcs.

mechanically shattering s. aureus enhanced their immune stimulatory efficacy in sm10
impaired immune stimulatory efficacy of the s. aureus particles in sm <dig> but proper response of the cells towards purified mimetics of authentic bacterial pamps suggested that these might not be adequately recognisable by pbmec, if structurally still arranged in the cell wall of the bacterium and administered in sm <dig>  hence, we used a ribolyser device to brake-up and shatter s. aureus in order to possibly excavate more of these pamps. we challenged the pbmec with particle free supernatants of such lysates for three hours in sm <dig>  we found for two different s. aureus strains that this treatment indeed significantly enhanced their immune stimulatory properties towards pbmec over the level recorded with heat killed pathogens from these strains . the average enhancement of pathogen induced expression of six immune genes was  <dig> to > <dig> fold  and expression of the nos2a gene was enhanced by spectacular  <dig> to > <dig> fold by disrupting the pathogens in the ribolyser. however, these lysates of the shattered s. aureus only marginally activated nf-κb in sm <dig> .table  <dig> enhanced immune gene induction by s. aureus in sm <dig> through pathogen disruption

differential influence of fcs upon tlr ligand-specific induction of tristetraproline expression
tristetraproline  is known to bind to the au-rich destabilizing are-sequence elements in the 3′-utr regions of cytokine and chemokine-encoding mrnas and plays a role in their active degradation. we have previously reported that the mrna concentration of this gene as well as the abundance of the encoded enzyme is increased after challenging pbmec with e. coli in sm <dig>  <cit> . we therefore examined if eventually a media differentiated induction of this factor might contribute to modulate the down regulation of the cyto- and chemokine-encoding  gene expression after e. coli stimulation. considering the pathogen particles we found that only challenging the pbmec in sm <dig> with e. coli resulted in a significant induction of the mrna concentration of this gene . its expression was neither induced by e. coli in the two other media nor by s. aureus in any of the stimulation media. yet, pam2csk <dig>  activated ttp expression in sm <dig> as well as in sm <dig> to a similar extent as recorded after stimulation with e. coli in sm <dig>  lps, on the other hand induced ttp expression only in sm <dig>  but not in sm <dig> fig.  <dig> modulation of ttp expression through fcs. a ttp expression is only activated by e. coli particles in sm <dig>  pbmec were stimulated with 30 μg/ml of heat killed pathogens media with or without 10 % fcs , for the time as indicated. the fold increase in the ttp mrna concentration above the control value is indicated. mean values ± sem from two biological replica experiments, each assayed in duplicate. only values from e. coli stimulation at 1 h and 3 h in sm <dig> resulted in significantly increased mean values . b addition of milk prevents induction of ttp expression. same experimental setting as above, but stimulation was in sm milk. no significant induction of ttp mrna concentration, but a significant  decrease compared to the unstimulated control at t 1 h. c pam2csk <dig>  but not lps triggers ttp expression irrespective of the presence of fcs. same experimental setting as in a) but stimulation was with 10 ng/ml of either pam2csk <dig> or highly purified lps. all values, but that for lps at 1 h after the challenge differed significantly  from the control value



discussion
the analysis of molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogen-specific resolution of mastitis eventually requires using relevant model cells in adequate conditions. it is widely accepted that primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells may serve as relevant cell models in this regard and some of its limitations have already been published  <cit> . we examined here the influence of fcs and milk proteins in the culture medium upon the pathogen specific immune response of pbmec in order to better define those adequate conditions.

we found as a key observation that withdrawal of fcs during the stimulation of pbmec with pathogens profoundly alters both, extent and kinetic of the pathogen dependent expression of immune genes. the effect of fcs alters more profoundly the pathogen specific reaction norm of the pbmec than challenging them with either live or heat killed pathogens. the data of our study regarding extent and kinetics of pathogen-specific immune gene induction recorded in both stimulation media, with  and without  fcs fully comply with previously published data from stimulation of pbmec with heat killed or live pathogens in the respective media. we observed that presence or absence of 10 % fcs introduces a very large difference in the extent by which e. coli vs. s. aureus induced in particular the cyto- and chemokine encoding immediate early immune genes. this readily explains why different groups have previously reported divergent data about both extent and kinetics of their induction by e. coli and s. aureus  <cit> . moreover, the finding that the s. aureus strain specific influence can only be recorded in sm <dig> explains why we have so far been unable to detect such strain specific differences, albeit considerable efforts and using genetically diverse strains. the comparison made here between s. aureus strains  <dig> and newbold n <dig> conducted in serum free medium  complies with a previous report in the fact that n <dig> is a relatively weak inducer of immune gene expression in pbmec  <cit> . we show here that the ribolyser treatment enhanced its immune stimulatory properties and this to a larger extent than encountered with strain rf <dig>  this implies that the heat killed particles of n <dig> did not expose all relevant immune stimulatory molecules to the pbmec target cells. moreover, the s. aureus strain specific differentiated effect of the ribolyser treatment suggests that some of the strain specific properties may reside in the specific structural make-up of the bacterial cell wall.

by cross-validating the results obtained under the different experimental conditions our study may remove doubts about credibility of data and validity of interpretations of divergent data having been published by various groups during the last years.

no recommendation can be given for an “adequate” stimulation medium
the nature of the in vivo environment of mec is completely unknown. neither are these cells in contact with a fluid containing 10 % of serum proteins  nor in a fluid completely deprived of serum components and proteins. however, the apical membrane is in contact with milk, containing approximately 35 mg/ml of milk proteins. these include anti-microbial factors as well as auxiliary factors known to be highly relevant for pathogen recognition, such as lbp and cd <dig> .

our study shows that one can pre-determine key features of the pathogen-species specific immune response of the pbmec by selecting the specific stimulation condition. the choice of the medium should consider the parameter one seeks to analyse. stimulating the pbmec in serum containing medium  will result in a pathogen-species specific induction kinetic of immune genes just as one would expect to find based on the respective response of the udder in vivo, after infection of the gland with live pathogens. stimulating them in sm <dig> with the same pathogen preparations will demonstrate a significantly induced expression of cytokine encoding genes by s. aureus or will allow to revealing s. aureus strain specific differences in the capacity to induce cytokine gene expression in pbmec. yet, one should avoid adding significant concentrations of milk proteins if the interest would be to explore the full capacity of the pbmec to respond to an s. aureus stimulus with induced gene transcription. moreover, the fact that not only the addition of serum protein, but also supplementation with milk-proteins eliminated any difference in the response of the mec towards different s. aureus strains is thought-provoking about the physiological relevance of such differences having been revealed under serum- and milk-protein free stimulation conditions  <cit> .

our results bear also on the molecular understanding of the pathogen-specific differentiated immune response of the mec.

many serum effects upon the e. coli specific response are related to tlr <dig> signalling
induced expression of the immediate early genes  by e. coli and lps was reduced and retarded in the fcs deprived sm <dig>  similarly as the time course of nf-κb activation. pathogen stimulus induced nf-κb activation in the target cell indicates tlr-mediated pathogen perception, since all tlrs are known to ultimately activate nf-κb factors. lps is the dominant pamp derived from e. coli and is the authentic ligand of tlr <dig>  <cit> . full activation of tlr <dig> signalling through lps requires that it is bound by the lipopolysaccharide binding protein  and that the auxiliary co-factors md <dig>  and cd <dig> contribute to present the ligand to the tlr <dig> receptor . lbp may be found in blood serum or milk  <cit> , but is missing in plain rpmi  <dig> medium. thus, tlr <dig> mediated recognition of lps may be impaired in sm <dig>  it was found, indeed that withdrawal of fcs from the stimulation medium quantitatively reduced  tlr <dig> mediated nf-κb activation in hek <dig> cells  <cit>  and retarded iκbα degradation in raw <dig> macrophages  <cit> . our data in this regard agree excellently with these reports.

however, not all effects of serum withdrawal can unambiguously be attributed to impaired tlr <dig> signalling. the response of the pbmec towards the e. coli stimulus was quite similar in sm <dig> and sm milk, as was the extent of nf-κb activation after challenging these cells for 24 h . the latter parameter indicates some tlr <dig> activation in all conditions, but the extent of increased cytokine mrna abundance was six fold higher in sm <dig> at 3 h after stimulation than in both other media. hence, fcs apparently provides some factors other than just lbp to both hasten and intensify expression of cytokine- and chemokine-encoding genes, but also that of nos2a. pleiotropic effects of fcs withdrawal were recently documented by showing that it not only attenuated and impaired tlr <dig> mediated nf-κb activation but also severely hindered the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines  after lps stimulation  <cit> . thus, serum starvation influences post-transcriptional events which are so essential to eliciting a fully efficient immune response. the differential effect of fcs upon the expression of the mrna destabilizing factor ttp is another example for multi-layered regulation through fcs .

s. aureus only very poorly activates nf-κb in pbmec
signalling from all tlr factors is known to ultimately converge in the activation of the nf-κb factor complex  <cit> . hence, lacking nf-κb activation in sm <dig> or sm milk and its only marginal activation in sm <dig> or through the ribolyser extracts in sm <dig> together indicate missing or only low level of tlr activation through s. aureus. this low level of nf-κb activation was quantitatively equivalent to a previous report about challenging the established bovine mec model cell mac-t with heat killed s. aureus . assuming poor tlr activation by s. aureus is augmented by the obviously lacking degradation of the nf-κb inhibitor iκbα, a prerequisite for the classical route of tlr-mediated nf-κb activation  <cit> . it might be that this method for monitoring nf-κb activation is just less sensitive than the reporter gene assay. alternatively, the increased nf-κb activity picked-up in the reporter gene assay after s. aureus stimulation sm <dig> might have been caused other mechanisms activating nf-κb factors downstream of iκbα degradation. it is known that nf-κb factors  require additional modification through phosphorylation, for example  <cit> . in this case mechanisms other than tlr-signalling might be responsible for the slight nf-κb activation recorded after stimulating the pbmec with s. aureus in sm <dig>  anyhow, our data collectively show that s. aureus does not fully activate tlr signalling, in none of these media.

tlr <dig> signalling is functional in mec and not modulated by fcs supplementation
it is known from genetic analyses that perception of gram-positive bacteria  crucially depends on the activation of tlr <dig> signalling, mainly conveyed through di-acetylated lipopeptides  <cit> . we found in this regard that only the lipopeptide mimetics pam2/3csk <dig> strongly activated nf-κb factors in the pbmec, hence activated tlr <dig> signalling. the effect can clearly be attributed to tlr <dig> signalling since the synthetic lipopeptides pam2/3csk <dig> have structurally been designed as specific tlr <dig> ligands. they activated with approximately equal efficacy in sm <dig> and sm <dig> both, nf-κb factors as well as the strong and rapid expression of cyto-and chemokine-encoding genes. therefore, tlr <dig> signalling is fully functional in pbmec and not compromised by fcs, provided that the pamps are offered as purified ligands. similar observations have previously been published for different pamps   <cit> ). hence, the failure of s. aureus to induce tlr-mediated nf-κb activation in pbmec is not due to just obstructing the interaction of relevant pamps with tlrs  through fcs. this conclusion is augmented by the strong tlr <dig> activation in the hek <dig> reconstitution system of tlr signalling conducted in a 10 % fcs containing growth medium . it is more likely that pamps relevant for tlr <dig> activation are generally not recognizable by the tlr <dig> receptor if this is expressed in the mec. the lipopeptides are apparently effectively hidden in the cell wall of s. aureus. the ribolyser treatment did not liberate them efficiently enough to serve as functional tlr <dig> ligands.

mec perceive the presence of s. aureus independently from tlr-signalling
induction of the expression of the immediate early genes by s. aureus appears to be independent from tlr signalling since this process, but not tlr <dig> signalling is strongly modulated by fcs. expression of these genes is under multiple controls  <cit> , including nod <dig> receptors and map kinases, besides activation through the tlr-axis  <cit> . further support for assuming tlr-independent perception of s. aureus by mec comes from the previous observation that challenging pbmec in the presence of 5 % fcs with supernatants from s. aureus activates ap <dig> - rather than nf-κb - governed regulatory networks  <cit> .

our data regarding the influence of the medium composition for tlr signalling and s. aureus perception by the mec collectively suggest that the tlr-axis has only a minor role for eliciting an immune alert against s. aureus in this cell type.

modulation of ttp expression exemplifies that the medium composition affects very different layers of immune gene regulation
stimulation with e. coli in sm <dig> and s. aureus in sm <dig> both caused a peak shaped increase of the cyto- and chemokine –encoding genes followed in both conditions by a similar decline of the mrna concentrations. hence, we anticipated that also the expression of the mrna decay factor ttp would be similarly triggered in both conditions. yet, we found unexpectedly that the expression of this gene was induced by e. coli in sm <dig>  but neither by e. coli in both other media, nor by s. aureus in any of these media. however, the pure ligands for tlr <dig> dependent signalling stimulated its expression irrespective of the presence of fcs. these data have various implications.

ttp expression was known to be under multiple controls and among them by serum factors and map kinases . our data add evidence that pure tlr2/ <dig> ligands trigger the expression of this gene in pbmec. the efficacy of the lps challenge to induce ttp expression in sm <dig>  but neither in sm <dig> nor in sm milk supports by corollary the assumption that some facets of productive tlr <dig> signalling are active only in sm <dig>  albeit activating nf-κb to a considerable extent in all three stimulation media. this shows that contact with milk or absence of fcs affects gene regulation in the mec also at levels distinct from the tlr axis.

the medium dependent modulation of ttp expression complies well with the different kinetics of e. coli induced modulation of the mrna levels of the immediate early genes in all three stimulation media. particularly intriguing in this regard is the correlation of lacking ttp induction through e. coli in sm milk and sustained high levels of the mrna concentrations of group a genes in this condition. however, our data imply as well that the down regulation of the mrna concentrations of those group a genes after stimulation with s. aureus in sm <dig> is mediated by mechanisms apparently being independent from induced ttp synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we show here by cross-validating the correctness of previous reports that the choice of the culture fluid of pbmec grossly alters the pathogen-species specific immune response of this cell type. including fcs into the growth medium allows inducing in pbmec an expression pattern of cyto- and chemokine encoding genes resembles phenotypically best what is known from the immune response of the udder during pathogen-species specific mastitis. addition of fetal calf serum or milk proteins is essential for tlr <dig> mediated signalling enhancing the response towards e. coli. omission of fcs will enforce s. aureus recognizing pathways independent from tlr-signalling. our data generally confirm that e. coli but not s. aureus triggers strong tlr signalling in mec in all conditions examined.
