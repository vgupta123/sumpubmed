BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle development and the regeneration of adult muscle tissue requires the completion of myogenesis: activation, proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of muscle specific stem cells, known as satellite cells  <cit> . myogenesis is highly regulated by cellular, molecular, and particularly hormonal signals that orchestrate cell mobility, cell contact, hormone sensitivity and the expression of muscle regulatory factors   <cit> .

hormone signaling is critical in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass. mitogenic signals from insulin and insulin-like growth factor  converge on the insulin receptor substrate  to regulate cell metabolism, protein synthesis, cell survival, and cell growth by activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase /protein kinase b  and extracellular signal-regulated kinase  signaling pathways  <cit> . however, the kinases and the mechanisms that regulate signal transduction through these cascades, as well as the result on myogenesis, are not completely characterized. specifically, pi3-kinase is a primary regulator of anabolic and catabolic responses that contribute to the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass, and is activated by irs <dig>  <cit> . importantly, the theta isoform of the protein kinase c family  phospho-inhibits insulin receptor substrate- <dig>  on ser <dig> , suppressing downstream activation of akt  <cit> , a target of pi3-kinase and mediator of anabolic and catabolic signaling  <cit> . pkcθ also regulates skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo <cit>  and myogenesis in vitro <cit> , albeit through mechanisms that are not completely understood. therefore, further investigation into the cellular signaling dynamics regulated by pkcθ will advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular regulation of the myogenic program.

pkc molecules are intracellular serine/threonine kinases expressed by a variety of cell types involved in diverse functions depending on their structure. pkc molecules are classified as either 1) conventional, containing ca2+ and diacylglycerol/phorbol binding domains, 2) novel, missing the ca2+ binding domain and 3) atypical, lacking the ca2+ and diacylglycerol binding domains  <cit> . pkcθ is a member of the novel family of pkc molecules and is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic  <cit>  and skeletal muscle cells  <cit> .

in skeletal muscle, pkcθ regulates, insulin sensitivity  <cit> , muscle cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> , skeletal muscle regeneration  <cit> , and expression of acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction  <cit> . nonetheless, the contribution of pkcθ to myogenesis is controversial. studies using human  <cit>  and chick  <cit>  primary muscle cells showed that pkcθ expression decreases throughout differentiation, a time associated with increased muscle creatine kinase  <cit>  and desmin  <cit>  protein levels, both of which support differentiation and myotube formation. pkcθ was not detected in mouse embryonic myoblasts, which were resistant to the inhibitory effects of phorbol esters and transforming growth factor beta   <cit>  on myotube formation  <cit> . genetic forced expression of pkcθ in mouse embryonic myoblasts prevented myotube formation in the presence of tgfβ and phorbol ester  <cit> . moreover, mice with dystrophic muscle have improved skeletal muscle regeneration when pkcθ is globally absent  <cit> . taken together, these studies support that pkcθ is a negative regulator of myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration. alternatively, primary muscle cell cultures derived from global pkcθ knockout mice and muscle-specific pkcθ kinase-dead mice have demonstrated a requirement for pkcθ in myogenesis and regeneration  <cit> . lastly, in c2c <dig> muscle cells, pkcθ expression remained constant and overexpression of pkcθ did not impair differentiation  <cit> .

the overall objective of this study was to investigate how pkcθ regulates cell signaling events that contribute to the advancement of the myogenic program. we hypothesized that pkcθ negatively regulates the myogenic program via irs <dig>  to test this hypothesis we used a short hairpin-rna  to specifically knockdown pkcθ expression in c2c <dig> cells , an established cell line for investigating the myogenic program  <cit> . we then investigated how reduced pkcθ affected signaling through the classical insulin signaling pathway in addition to the affect on differentiation and fusion of muscle myoblasts. our data reveal a pkcθ-regulated myogenic pathway involving serine phosphorylation of irs <dig> and phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in the control of myoblast differentiation that enhances our understanding of how pkcθ contributes to myogenic signaling.

RESULTS
knockdown of pkcθ in c2c <dig> cells
to investigate the mechanism by which pkcθ regulates muscle cell differentiation and fusion, a stable pkcθ knockdown  cell line using c2c <dig> mouse muscle cells  was generated by transfecting with a pkcθ shrna. transfection reduced pkcθ protein and gene expression by approximately 80% compared to cells transfected with scramble oligonucleotides  . additionally, phosphorylation of pkcθ was significantly reduced in pkcθshrna myoblasts . gene expression of pkc delta , also a member of the novel family of pkc molecules, was not different between pkcθshrna and scramble myoblasts , indicating specificity of the shrna.

pkcθ is a negative regulator of myogenesis in c2c <dig> muscle cells
to determine how the loss of pkcθ affects differentiation and fusion of myoblasts, pkcθshrna and scramble cells were exposed to differentiation media for  <dig> days. on day  <dig>  pkcθshrna cells formed a greater number of tube-like structures compared to scramble cells . this is in agreement with increased myogenin transcript levels from day  <dig> through day  <dig> of differentiation in pkcθshrna cells . on the fourth day, cells were stained for myosin heavy chain  to identify differentiated cells and counterstained with dapi to identify nuclei . mhc protein expression via western blot  and immuno staining  were markedly increased, approximately  <dig> fold and  <dig>  fold respectively, in pkcθshrna compared to scramble cultures. in addition, the number of nuclei per mhc+ cell, an indication of cell fusion, was 20% greater in pkcθshrna cultures , indicating pkcθ is a myogenic suppressor of c2c <dig> myoblast differentiation and fusion.

focal adhesion kinase  and caveolin  <dig> are necessary for myoblast fusion and in vivo regeneration  <cit> . here, the gene expression of fak  and caveolin  <dig>  were analyzed through  <dig> days of differentiation. interestingly, mrna levels of fak remained lower in pkcθshrna compared to scramble cells from day  <dig> through day  <dig> of differentiation . caveolin  <dig> mrna levels remained similar between cell types from day  <dig> through day  <dig> of differentiation. at day  <dig> of differentiation, caveolin  <dig> levels dropped in pkcθshrna myotubes while increasing slightly in the scramble culture resulting in a significant difference .

a decrease in fak protein expression was reported following  <dig> hours of differentiation  <cit> , which supports our results. furthermore, fak regulates the expression of caveolin  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, reduced expression of caveolin  <dig> reported here might be the result of down-regulated fak. the lower expression levels of both fak and caveolin  <dig> in our pkcθshrna cells following  <dig> days of differentiation support the acceleration of the fusion process compared to scramble cultures. it is possible that fak expression peaks in pkcθshrna cells at an earlier time point than analyzed here, propagating accelerated myotube development. alternatively, muscle cells derived from global pkcθ knockout mice  have impaired myogenic properties in vitro associated with reduced fak and caveolin  <dig>  <cit> . importantly, expression levels of fak and caveolin  <dig> were analyzed after  <dig> days in differentiation conditions  <cit> , while cells in this study were differentiated for  <dig> days prior to analysis. indeed, primary cultures derived from pkcθ−/− display impaired fusion in vitro <cit> , which is in contrast to our data here, derived from c2c <dig> cells in which shrna was used to knockdown pkcθ expression. although differences between a primary culture and cell line may contribute to the desperate findings, the in vivo milieu is complex and dynamic, and cellular interactions between inflammatory and skeletal muscle cells, two sources of pkcθ  <cit> , may promote changes in cellular function that alter ex vivo cellular dynamics. inflammatory cells play an integral role in regulating skeletal muscle size  <cit> .

primary mouse muscle cells isolated from skeletal muscle pkcθ kinase-dead mice also have impaired myogenic properties and regeneration in vivo <cit> , contrary to results presented in this study. importantly, pkcθ translocates to the nucleus in cultured human muscle satellite cells  <cit>  and other cell types where it directly associates with chromatin  <cit> . also, in t-cells, pkcθ directly binds cytosolic proteins to regulate activity  <cit> . together, these findings demonstrate that pkcθ has functions beyond its kinase activity including protein-protein interactions and protein-dna interactions that remain to be completely explored in skeletal muscle. these functions of pkcθ may explain the contradictory results obtained with our model compared to other models, which rely on substrate binding and availability  <cit> . indeed, mice with muscular dystrophy and the additional global null mutation for pkcθ, have enhanced skeletal muscle regeneration  <cit> , suggesting a negative role for pkcθ in the regulation of myogenesis. further work exploring the cellular and molecular interactions of skeletal muscle pkcθ across multiple models is warranted to more completely understand its myogenic regulatory role.

lack of pkcθ enhances protein synthesis apart from classical irs <dig> signaling
our data indicates that pkcθ negatively regulates the differentiation and fusion of myoblasts. because pkcθ inhibits irs <dig> through serine phosphorylation and this results in the downstream suppression of akt  <cit> , we tested the hypothesis that pkcθ regulates myoblast differentiation and fusion through altered irs <dig> signaling. irs <dig> signal transduction regulates cell growth and protein synthesis through pi3-kinase/akt activation and the mapk cascade involving mek1/2/erk signaling  <cit> . irs <dig> serine phosphorylation of specific residues inhibits downstream signaling by preventing irs <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . specifically, phosphorylation of serine <dig>  by pkcθ impairs insulin signaling  <cit> . in support of our hypothesis, pkcθshrna cells had elevated rates of protein synthesis determined by  phenylalanine incorporation , accompanied by reduced irs <dig> serine <dig> phosphorylation following  <dig> days of differentiation . however, myogenic events are likely independent of insulin receptor  signaling because its tyrosine phosphorylation was lower in pkcθshrna cells  despite increased differentiation, fusion, and protein synthesis . furthermore, irs <dig> phosphorylation at tyrosine  <dig> was reduced in pkcθshrna myotubes . moreover, phosphorylation of akt, a kinase activated in response to irs1/pi3-kinase signaling  <cit> , was not different between cell types at serine  <dig>  however was reduced in pkcθshrna myotubes at threonine  <dig> . lastly, phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin  at serine  <dig>  a downstream target of akt, was also reduced in pkcθshrna day  <dig> myotubes . collectively, our protein synthesis and immunoblot data suggests involvement of a mechanism other than the canonical irs1/pi3-kinase/akt signaling pathway in promoting differentiation, fusion and protein synthesis in pkcθshrna cells.

mapks participate in the regulation of a plethora of cellular functions, including the proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells and the modulation of irs <dig> signaling. specifically, erk1/ <dig> expression increases during differentiation of c2c <dig> cells  <cit>  and permits the expression of myosin heavy chain  <cit> . furthermore, erk <dig> regulates myogenesis in a pathway independent of that, which activates myod, and mef <dig> regulated genes  <cit> . moreover, mek1/ <dig> is a positive regulator of the muscle specific transcription factor myod whose expression is required for the initiation of myoblast differentiation  <cit> . erk also reciprocally signals to irs <dig>  <cit> . in 3t3-l <dig> cells, irs <dig> serine 636/ <dig> phosphorylation causes irs <dig> degradation  <cit>  which is dependent on mek1/2-induced erk activation in human skeletal muscle cells  <cit> . finally, in myeloma cells, erk is phosphorylated through an irs1-dependent mechanism  <cit> . in this study, total irs <dig> protein levels were markedly reduced in pkcθshrna cells together with increased phosphorylation of serine 632/ <dig>   in day  <dig> myotubes, suggesting erk-dependent signaling. as anticipated, erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was increased in pkcθshrna cells . while erk <dig> has been demonstrated to also regulate fusion of c2c <dig> muscle cells  <cit> , a difference in erk <dig> phosphorylation between pkcθshrna and scramble cultures was not detected . while phosphorylation sites on erk <dig> other than those analyzed here contribute to cell growth an survival in other cell types, these sites have been shown regulate mitotic activity  <cit>  rather than terminal differentiation.

interestingly, mtor has been identified as a substrate for erk  <cit> , and mtor is required for the fusion of differentiated skeletal muscle cells  <cit> . skeletal muscle overexpression of rheb increased mtor mediated kinase events resulting in increased skeletal muscle size and protein translation independent of pi3-kinase and pkb   <cit> . here, mtor phosphorylation was reduced in pkcθshrna day  <dig> myotubes suggesting that mtor is not a prime regulator of protein synthesis and myotube development in cells lacking pkcθ at the time point analyzed.

our data together with prior reports  <cit>  support that lack of pkcθ in c2c <dig> myotubes promotes erk1/ <dig> mediated phosphorylation of irs <dig> at serine 632/ <dig>  while this mechanism corroborates our finding of reduced total irs <dig> protein , further work is required to determine the mechanism by which these signaling events lead to enhanced protein synthesis. nonetheless, these data show a novel pathway by which protein synthesis is increased despite reduced insulin receptor and akt phosphorylation.

pkcθ regulates irs <dig> and erk-mediated differentiation
the purpose of these studies was to determine which kinases downstream of irs <dig> mediate myoblast differentiation and fusion in pkcθshrna cells. scramble and pkcθshrna cells were treated with the pi3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin to attenuate pi3-kinase/akt activation  or the mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig> to inhibit erk activity . wortmannin completely blocked the expression of mhc and subsequent cell fusion in scramble cells , consistent with prior reports  <cit> . u <dig> drastically reduced mhc expression and fusion in scramble cells compared to untreated cultures . however, expression of mhc was greater in u <dig> compared to wortmannin treated scramble cells, indicating a greater degree of differentiation . while the number of nuclei per mhc+ cell was statistically greater in u <dig> compared to wortmannin treated scramble cultures, fewer than  <dig> nuclei per mhc+ cell indicates markedly impaired fusion .

compared to wortmannin treated scramble cells, pkcθshrna cells had increased differentiation and maintained the ability to fuse despite the presence of the pi3-kinase inhibitor . moreover, pkcθshrna myotubes maintained higher rates of protein synthesis when treated with wortmannin compared to scramble cultures. specifically, in agreement with figure 3a, protein synthesis was approximately 2-fold higher in pkcθshrna compared to scramble day  <dig> myotubes exposed to vehicle . in response to wortmannin, pkcθshrna protein synthesis rates remained 35% higher in pkcθshrna compared to scramble myotubes . thus, pkcθshrna cells are able to complete the myogenic program independent of pi3-kinase signaling. these results support our protein expression data  in which reduced ir and akt phosphorylation were found in pkcθshrna compared to scramble day  <dig> myotubes. importantly, wortmannin treatment of pkcθshrna reduced differentiation to levels comparable to untreated scramble cultures . therefore, while lack or pkcθ in c2c <dig> myotubes is permissive for differentiation despite pi3-kinase inhibition, pi3-kinase signaling may be necessary to manifest the enhanced and accelerated myotube development observed in untreated cultures.

pkcθshrna cells treated with u <dig> had markedly increased density of mhc+ cells . cell fusion, on the other hand, as determined by nuclei per mhc+ cell, was not different between pkcθshrna and scramble cells in the presence of the mek inhibitor . there was also no difference in protein synthesis rates between pkcθshrna and scramble myotubes treated with u <dig> . shrna-mediate reduction of pkcθ protected muscle cell differentiation in the presence of both pi3-kinase and mek1/ <dig> inhibition, but cell fusion was protected only in the presence of pi3-kinase inhibition. take together, these data show that mek1/ <dig> signaling is required for cell fusion independently of differentiation and the expression of pkcθ. furthermore, our data suggests a pkcθ-specific myogenic regulatory pathway involving irs <dig> and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation events in the regulation of muscle cell differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
the objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of skeletal muscle cell pkcθ to signaling events that regulate protein synthesis and myogenesis. taken together, our data supports a model in which pkcθ regulates irs <dig> and erk1/ <dig> signaling that controls myoblast differentiation and protein synthesis. our findings that cell fusion is equally inhibited in scramble and pkcθshrna myotubes treated with a mek1/ <dig> inhibitor suggests that mek signaling is required for fusion independent of pkcθ. additionally, abrogation of pkcθ promoted full completion of the myogenic program and increased rates of protein synthesis, despite reduced ir phosphorylation and maintained higher protein synthesis rates when treated with a pi3-kinase inhibitor. these findings demonstrate that pkcθ may be a viable therapeutic target to promote increases in protein synthesis and promote the maintenance of skeletal muscle health in conditions with impaired insulin signaling.
