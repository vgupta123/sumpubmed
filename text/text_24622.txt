BACKGROUND
respiratory syncytial virus  is a major respiratory pathogen, which typically infects the airway epithelium  <cit> . those infected with rsv, usually infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients but also healthy adults  <cit> , develop mild to severe cough and dyspnea  <cit> . wheezing and asthma symptoms are observed following severe rsv lower respiratory tract infection  <cit> . rsv infection occur frequently in the respiratory tract of individuals with an underlying lung disease, such chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit> . a range of inflammatory responses are associated with rsv infection, such as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, such as groα/cxcl <dig>  il-1β, il1-ra, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  cxcl8/il- <dig>  il- <dig>  cxcl10/ip- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ccl2/mcp- <dig>  ccl3/mip-1α, ccl4/mip-1β, ifn-γ, ccl5/rantes, epidermal growth factor , hepatocyte growth factor , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor , gm-csf, fibroblast growth factor , vascular endothelial cell growth factor  and tumor necrosis factor-α   <cit> . the importance of this cytokine response is underscored by the fact that increased levels of il-1β, il1-ra, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  g-csf, egf and hgf are associated with rsv infection severity  <cit> . others have found that snps in il- <dig>  il- <dig>  muc5ac, tnfrsf1b, c <dig>  ctla <dig>  cxcl <dig>  il4r, and il- <dig> genes are associated with recurrent wheezing following rsv infections  <cit> . although rsv-induced cytokines have been studied extensively, the signaling mechanisms that regulate their expression and whether specific host cytokines contribute to airway injury or inflammation resolution remain incompletely understood.

pathological studies demonstrate that rsv primarily infects airway epithelial cells  <cit> ; therefore it is conceivable that a significant component of immune signaling associated with rsv infections originates from airway epithelial responses. cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are expressed in these cells in response to microbial stimuli  <cit>  with numerous pathogen recognition receptors playing a major role in cytokine responses. pathogen recognition receptors, such as tlrs and retinoic acid–inducible gene- <dig> -like receptors  <cit> , induce major signaling cascades following viral stimulation  <cit> . indeed, the viral load of rsv correlates with rig-i mrna levels  <cit> . tlr <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> recognize nucleic acid ligands but tlr <dig> proteins also bind to a major viral antigen of rsv f  protein  <cit> . laboratory of genetics and physiology  <dig>  and melanoma differentiation–associated protein- <dig>  equally could be associated with rsv-induced immune responses  <cit> . additionally, ligands for nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein -like receptors , such as nod <dig>  enhance tlr-ligand-induced activation and triggering such signaling cascades are plausible means of developing rsv-specific immunity  <cit> . therefore, rsv can induce several pathogen recognition receptors resulting in multiple host immune responses.

in this study we employed in vitro and in vivo approaches to evaluate the cytokine/chemokine response to rsv infection. normal human small airway epithelial  cells and a <dig> cells were utilized to examine  <dig> cytokine responses following rsv stimuli. several newly identified rsv-inducible cytokines , migration inhibitory factor , stem cell factor , ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and stem cell growth factor beta ) were induced in airways cells in vitro and in mouse lungs during a viral infection in vivo. the influence of tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β  and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein  signaling pathways were examined on rsv-induced cytokine levels in mice and a <dig> cells. the significance of lif, an il- <dig> cytokine family member, expression during rsv was also determined. lif is primarily recognized for its ability to preserve the totipotency of embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and is detected in acute respiratory distress syndrome   <cit>  but recently lif was described to protect the lung from injury during pneumonia  <cit> . utilizing neutralizing anti-lif igg, lif was observed to play a critical role in protecting the lung from injury during rsv infection. our findings indicate that rsv infection induces a significant host cytokine response associated with viral clearance and airway protection.

RESULTS
sae and a <dig> cells secrete similar cytokines following rsv stimuli
a human cytokine array was used to simultaneously detect the levels of  <dig> different cytokines, chemokines, and acute phase proteins in a <dig> cells treated with mock and rsv for 24 hours. protein array analysis identified that a large number of cytokines are released from a <dig> cells upon rsv stimuli . the most striking rsv inducible cytokines were il- <dig>  il- <dig>  mcp-1/ccl <dig>  mif, groα/cxcl <dig>  and rantes/ccl <dig> . to complement the cytokine array analysis, multiplex analysis was performed to examine  <dig> cytokines, chemokines and growth factors released from a <dig> cells, in addition to human sae cells. both sae and a <dig> cells released similar cytokines in response to rsv infection . in both a <dig> and sae cells, rsv significantly induced il-1α, il-1β, il-1ra, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  fibroblast growth factor , g-csf, ifn-γ, cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  mif, platelet-derived growth factor , tnf-α, vegf, lif, ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  scgf-β and scf release into media. interestingly, sae cells also released il- <dig>  il- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig> and hgf upon rsv stimulation. a <dig> cells differed to sae cells in releasing il- <dig>  il- <dig>  gm-csf, ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand  upon rsv stimulation. rsv-inducible cytokines were examined following stimulation with uv-inactivated rsv in a <dig> cells, to determine if cytokines are induced following viral detection or viral replication. rantes/ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  scgf-β, ccl <dig>  lif, mif, cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  il- <dig>  scf, il- <dig>  tnf-α and g-csf were all secreted following stimuli with live rsv only . il- <dig> and ifn- γ was secreted at significantly higher levels from uv-rsv treated cells compared to mock treated cells but at lower levels to live rsv . therefore, rsv replication induces a plethora of immune responses in airway epithelial cells.table  <dig>

mif, lif, ccl <dig>  cxcl12/sdf-1α, scgf-β and scf are expressed in the airways of mice following rsv challenge
gene expression and balf protein levels for mif, lif, ccl <dig>  cxcl12/sdf-1α, scgf-β and scf were examined in wild-type  mice  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 9 days post mock, rsv or uv-rsv intranasal challenge , as these cytokines have not been reported in the literature to be rsv inducible. increased gene expression of mif, lif, cxcl <dig>  scgf-β and scf was observed following 1 day of rsv challenge . rsv inducible ccl <dig> was only observed 5 days post challenge. uv-inactivated rsv did not alter airway expression of these cytokines . multiplex or elisa was performed to examine balf protein levels of lif, ccl <dig>  cxcl12/sdf-1α, and scf. similarly to gene expression profiles, balf levels of scf, lif, ccl27/ctak and cxcl12/sdf-1α were all enhanced in mice exposed to rsv infection compared to mock or uv-rsv treated animals . these new rsv-inducible targets represent new plausible targets for investigation in the human disease.figure  <dig>

rsv activates tlrs and rig-i-like receptors 
nasopharyngeal cells from infants with rsv infection have gene expression differences for mda- <dig>  rig- <dig>  tlr- <dig>  and tlr- <dig>  <cit> . since rsv infection induces a large repertoire of host cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, several of the major pathogen recognition receptors were profiled in each cell type to determine the potential regulators of the immune response to rsv infection. therefore, qpcr and immunoblots were performed for p-irf <dig>  irf <dig>  p-tbk <dig>  tbk-1/nak, rig-i, lgp <dig>  mda <dig>  mavs, lgp <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  trif, myd <dig>  irak <dig>  nod <dig> and β-actin. the remaining tlr genes and other nod genes  were also profiled in both cell types. a <dig> and sae cells became readily infected with rsv 24 hours after incubation  and had significant increases in rig-i, mda <dig>  lgp <dig>  nod <dig>  trif, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> gene expression in both cell types . tlr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gene expressions were also enhanced in sae cells following rsv infection. tlr <dig> gene expression was increased in a549s cells. protein profiles were analyzed for several of the receptors with the greatest gene induction with rsv infection, by immunoblots. increased cellular protein levels of rig-i, mda <dig>  lgp <dig>  trif and tlr <dig> were observed by immunblotting in both a <dig> and sae cells . utilizing densitometry analysis, no significant changes in nod <dig> and tlr <dig> protein levels were observed in either a <dig> or sae cells possibility due to lower induction of gene expression for these targets . to investigate the activation status of receptors, downstream signaling transduction analysis was performed for the phosphorylation of irf <dig>  tbk <dig>  degradation of irak <dig> and increased expression of trif and myd <dig>  irf <dig> and tbk <dig> underwent phosphorylation following rsv infection, confirming activation of these pathways . equally, increases in trif and decreased irak <dig> levels were observed after rsv challenge , further confirming that several receptors underwent activation. due to the activation intensity of the rlr, activation of irf <dig> and induction of the trif/tlr <dig>  in vivo studies were undertaken specifically examining the trif and rlr pathways.figure  <dig>

trif and mavs ko mice have reduced cytokine responses to rsv challenge
others have reported that rig-i is essential for host immune defenses against rsv  <cit>  and our in vitro studies suggest that both tlr <dig> and rlr signaling are highly responsive to rsv. to assess the importance of rsv-induced tlr <dig> and rlr signaling on cytokine production, wild-type , trif and mavs ko mice were infected with rsv and cytokines levels were investigated by qpcr on lung tissue and multiplex analysis on balf. mavs ko mice were utilized as mavs links rig-i and mda <dig> to antiviral effectors responses. mice were exposed to rsv and euthanized days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 9 days after the rsv challenge. loss of trif and mavs expression in mice did not significantly alter loss in body weight following rsv infection compared to wild-type mice  but loss of mavs or trif resulted in a greater viral load in the airway tissue on day  <dig> following infection compared to wild-type mice .figure  <dig>

cytokine gene expression levels were determined in lung tissue from wild-type, trif ko and mavs ko mice 1 days post rsv challenge by qpcr, except ctak/ccl <dig> which was examined 5 days post rsv challenge. values are represented as mean rq  ± s.e.m. each assay was performed in triplicate, where n =  <dig> animals/group. bold numbers denoted by *represents a p value less than  <dig>  compared to mock treated mice. #denotes a p value less than  <dig>  compared to rsv treated wild-type mice.



silencing rig-i expression in a <dig> cells subdues cytokine production
rlrs  and trif were silenced in a <dig> cells to establish which rlr signaling was required for rsv inducible host cytokines . loss of rig-i expression significantly decreased rsv induced il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  mcp-1/ccl <dig>  ip-9/cxcl <dig>  ip-10/cxcl <dig>  tnf-α, mif, rantes/ccl <dig> and scgf-β . interestingly, scgf-β release was altered following loss of expression of rig-i, mda <dig> and lgp <dig> . ctak/ccl <dig> release was only altered following silencing of mda <dig> or trif expression . trif expression regulated mif, lif, ctak/ccl <dig>  sdf-1α/cxcl <dig> and il-1β . therefore, these results show that host rig-i is the primary rlr to regulate rsv-mediated immune responses.figure  <dig>

neutralization lif enhances lung injury during an rsv infection
administration of recombinant lif to the airways has a protective effect in response to lps treatment  <cit> , hyperoxia  <cit>  and to bacterial pneumonia  <cit> . the functional relevance of lif expression during a rsv infection is unknown. administration of anti-lif igg resulted in rsv-infected animals losing weight faster than control igg treated littermates . the total number of immune cells in the balf was comparable between rsv treated groups . however, balf cells in the animals administered anti-lif igg were undergoing apoptosis at a greater rate than control igg animals . inhibition of lif signaling also subdued rsv induced airway hyperresponsiveness, demonstrated by respiratory system resistance  measurements during a methacholine dose challenge . anti-lif igg treated mice had significantly higher protein concentration  in the balf compared to infected control igg treated mice, suggesting potentially increased damage and disruption of the epithelial cell barrier. lung rsv burdens were not significantly affected by lif blockade seven days following rsv challenge . lung cytokine gene expression was determined by qpcr and blocking lif signaling resulted in enhanced cxcl <dig>  rantes/ccl <dig>  cxcl10/ip- <dig>  mip-1α/ccl <dig> and mcp-1/ccl <dig> compared to control igg treated mice, 7-days post rsv infection . altogether, these results suggest that lif expression suppresses lung cell apoptosis, airway hyperresponsiveness, epithelial cell barrier damage, cytokine production and subsequently airway injury.figure  <dig> 
rsv induced airway injury is enhanced following lif neutralization. fvb/nj mice were ip injected with control igg or anti-lif igg prior to intranasal infected with 1x <dig> pfu of rsv and animals were euthanized 7-days post infection.  animal body weight,  balf cellularity and balf cells undergoing apoptosis were determined.  airway hyperresponsiveness to increasing doses of methacholine was assessed in each animal group.  rsv infected animals receiving anti-lif igg have enhanced protein content in balf compared to mice administered control igg.  neutralizing lif levels did not impact on rsv viral multiplicity, demonstrated by qpcr for rsv n.  cxcl <dig>  rantes, ccl <dig>  cxcl10/ip- <dig>  mip-1α/ccl <dig> and mcp-1/ccl <dig> gene expression in lung tissue was analyzed by qpcr. graphs are represented as mean ± s.e.m., where each measurement was performed  <dig> times on  <dig> animals/group. * represents a p value less than  <dig>  comparing control igg and anti-lif igg treated mice both infected with rsv.



discussion
to our knowledge, these findings represent the first evidence that mif, lif, ctak/ccl <dig>  sdf-1α/cxcl <dig>  scgf-β and scf are expressed during an rsv infection and lif signaling is critical to prevent lung damage. others and we demonstrate that a spectrum of cytokines is released to counter rsv infection  <cit>  but further analysis is required to determine the role of these immune responses in rsv pathology. the results of this study demonstrate that rlrs and trif signaling pathways play major roles in the immune response to rsv infection for both inflammation induction and resolution. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> cytokines examined in a <dig> and sae cells were released upon rsv stimulation. this study highlights the robust epithelial responses to rsv infection, characterizes two major signaling cascade needed to counter viral infectivity and identified the role of lif signaling during an rsv infection.

many of the rsv-inducible cytokines described in this study have already been described in clinical samples, in vitro epithelial cell culture or in animals models  <cit> , such as elevated mig/cxcl <dig> levels in balb/c mice inoculated with rsv  <cit> . importantly, increases in media or mouse balf il1-ra, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  cxcl10/ip- <dig>  cxcl8/il- <dig>  ccl2/mcp- <dig>  ccl3/mip-1α, ccl4/ mip-1β, tnf-α, ifn-γ and ccl5/rantes following rsv infection reflects similar observations from clinical studies  <cit> . to our knowledge, we are the first to identify that rsv infection in epithelial cells and mice can induce mif, lif, ctak/ccl <dig>  sdf-1α/cxcl <dig>  scgf-β and scf expression and secretions. this is an important finding as each new target can potentially play a different role in rsv clearance. mif activates lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages and plays a key role in several host immune cell responses  <cit> . ctak/ccl <dig> is a cytokine associated with t cell activation and migration  <cit>  and is elevated in severe tuberculosis cases  <cit> . recombinant protein sdf-1α/cxcl <dig> does not prevent rsv infection of hep <dig> cells  <cit>  but sdf-1α/cxcl <dig> is strongly chemotactic for lymphocytes  <cit>  and contributes to pulmonary fibrosis  <cit> . the potential role of scgf-β in rsv infections is not as straightforward to elucidate but scgf-β can support growth of primitive hematopoietic cells  <cit>  and can promotes proliferation of erythroid or myeloid progenitors. scf and its soluble receptor c-kit correlate with asthma severity  <cit> . this study identified an important role for lif in rsv infection. therefore, identifying these new rsv inducible targets in clinical samples and their role in viral clearance may provide important insights into host responses to rsv infection.

other investigators have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of lif expression in other models of lung injury, as it protects against lung injury  <cit> . recombinant lif reduces cytokine expression  <cit>  and alters alveolar neutrophil numbers  <cit> . lif ko animals have increased expression of cxcl <dig>  gm-csf, rantes/ccl <dig> and mip-1α/ccl <dig> early during an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model and reduced ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> at a later stage of the disease  <cit> . in this study neutralizing lif signaling enhanced cxcl <dig>  rantes/ccl <dig>  cxcl10/ip- <dig>  mip-1α/ccl <dig> and mcp-1/ccl <dig> at day  <dig> of an rsv infection. therefore lif expression has the potential to regulate key factors in the immune system. targeted overexpression of lif in mouse airway epithelial cells significantly protects the airways during hyperoxia, with improved survival and decreased pulmonary edema  <cit> . other il- <dig> family members  have similar functions, which suggest that il- <dig> family cytokines may collectively protect lungs from injury. lif is a prominent stat3-activating cytokine that facilitates tissue protection during pneumonia  <cit>  and plays a similar airway protective role during rsv infection. the significance of lif expression and stat <dig> activation in rsv infection represents an intriguing area for further study. lif has been shown to regulate apoptosis with some investigators suggesting lif acts as a pro-apoptotic mediator  <cit>  while others have demonstrated lif to have anti-apoptotic potential  <cit> . in this study increased apoptotic bal cells were observed in animals administered anti-lif igg prior to rsv infection. enhanced fas, fap, il <dig>  and tnfsf <dig> expression is observed following lif depletion in animals with bacterial pneumonia  <cit> , which could contribute to the increased apoptosis observed here. whether this induction of apoptosis contributes to the pathology observed in this study is unknown and requires further investigation. epithelial damage correlates with airway hyperreactivity in asthma patients  <cit>  and the increased protein levels in the balf of animals treated with anti-lif igg prior to rsv infection could also contribute to the enhanced airway resistance observed in these animals. lif enhances the maintenance of stem cells  <cit> , which may directly impact lung tissue regeneration and repair  <cit> , similar to il- <dig> activation of stat <dig>  <cit> . these data reveal the vast biological processes of lif signaling during rsv infection. whether the other cytokines identified in this study also play such major roles on disease pathology needs to be addressed.

our study also reveals that trif and rlr signaling regulate a significant proportion of the cytokines induced by rsv infection, with lif expression sensitive to trif activation. prior to undertaking this study, several pathogen recognition receptors were associated with regulating the immune response against rsv infection, with rig-i  <cit> , tlr <dig>  <cit>  and tlr <dig>  <cit>  known to affect numerous cytokine responses. several investigators characterized the rig-i-like family proteins as critical for the detection of rsv, using human cell lines  <cit>  and knockout mice  <cit> . rig-i principally recognizes dsrna  <cit> ; however sendai virus defective interfering rna  <cit>  and the genomic “panhandle” structure of influenza virus  <cit>  activate rlr signaling. these “panhandle” structures allow negative-strand rna viral genomes to achieve partially double-stranded rna  <cit> , which may allow rsv to induce rlrs. our study observed early cytokine responses following rsv infection and identified a pronounced rig-i response, which could be lost over time following ns <dig> or ns <dig> binding to rig-i/mda <dig> as reported by others  <cit> . also, rsv induction of tlr <dig> is regulated by rig-i-dependent ifn-β secretions from infected epithelial cells, which is mediated by both ifn response-stimulated element  and signal transducer and activator of transcription  sites in its proximal promoter  <cit> . therefore there are multiple levels of rlrs regulation in rsv infections that can both trigger rlrs responses or subsequently adapt to block rlr-mediated signaling.

recently, several investigators have utilized well-defined primary cell culture techniques to investigate viral-host interactions  <cit> , which may be a closer representation of human rsv infections compared to the approach we employed here. ifn-α/β are not secreted by rsv-infected well-defined bronchial epithelial cells  <cit> , suggesting that there could be major signaling differences in well-defined primary cell culture techniques and monolayers. however, our overall findings suggest that utilizing cell monolayers in combination with mouse models is an acceptable approach as our cytokine profile are comparable to that observed in the human disease state  <cit> . in addition, our study has exposed new rsv inducible host immune response cytokines. since we only explored epithelial cell responses in vitro, our in vivo parallel approach also validates our monolayer results and suggests that the epithelium is a significant source of initial immune responses following rsv infection.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies demonstrate that rsv exposure stimulates a cascade of early immune response in epithelial cells and a large number of these responses act in an rlr/trif dependent manner. these findings also identified new cytokines that are triggered by rsv lung infection, with lif signaling critical for the protection of the lung from injury during rsv infection. profiling the loss and gain of the other identified cytokines  over the course of an rsv infection may help to decipher the relevancy of these cytokines in viral clearance and lung integrity, and represents important questions to be addressed by future studies.
