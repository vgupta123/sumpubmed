BACKGROUND
epidemiological evidence indicates that multiparity and breastfeeding as well as endocrine disrupting agents -used in oral contraception, hormone replacement therapy and infertility treatment- modulate the risk of ovarian cancer  <cit> . repetitive lifetime ovulations would induce a persistent wound repair process of the ovarian surface epithelium cells leading to pre-neoplastic alterations  <cit> . in addition, oral contraceptives and pregnancy reduce levels of circulating gonadotropins whereas fertility drugs induce follicle-stimulating hormone  production. gonadotropins also increase with reproductive ageing, and have been implicated in ovarian cancer etiology since this malignancy predominantly occurs in menopausal women  <cit> .

the laboratory mouse has been increasingly used to model several aspects of ovarian cancer  <cit> . indeed, reproductive biology of mouse resembles human reproduction in many aspects. analogous to menstrual cycles in women, female mice undergo estrous cycles that last 4- <dig> days and consist of four successive phases. proestrus and estrous phases together constitute the follicular phase while metestrus and diestrus phases together represent the luteal phase  <cit> . similar to humans, the length of estrous cycles increases while the monthly cycle frequency decreases in ageing mice  <cit> . the number of ovulations roughly reaches  <dig> during the reproductive life of women while in mice this number can be achieved earlier than middle age due to multiple ovulations in a single cycle  <cit>  as judged by the litter size observed in mice  <cit> . cysts, invaginations and cell layering are also common observations in the mouse and human ovaries  <cit> .

mouse inbred strains display measurable traits that are described as continuous phenotypes in the mouse phenome  <cit>  and the mouse tumor biology  <cit>  databases. the natural variability observed in mice strains offers the opportunity to study disease susceptibility in a genetically defined background. in simple terms, phenotypic variability could be due to the interplay of gene transcripts and/or proteins expressed at different relative abundances across individuals in a tissue or cell type implicated in a phenotype. thus, if a correlation exists between a continuous phenotype and gene expression, a measure of each gene’s contribution to the observed phenotype can be inferred. dna microarrays are suited to measure transcript levels for hundreds or thousands of genes simultaneously, and thus such contribution can be addressed in a wide-genome format. a number of statistical approaches have been recently formulated to correlate dna microarray data with phenotypic covariates  <cit> .

in an attempt to gain novel information linking reproductive parameters with ovarian tumorigenesis we describe here a correlation analysis between spontaneous ovarian tumors, reproductive phenotypes and gene expression profiles obtained with nia15k-dna microarrays from ovaries of four mouse inbred strains. using a linear regression approach with control of multiple testing, “ovarian tumor frequency”  and “number of litters”  were the top-correlated of  <dig> analyzed phenotypes. about one hundred genes were coincident between otf and nl. the enriched biological functions in this overlapped sub-set were “rna-binding/mrna-processing” and “protein folding”. the relevant information concerning the significant genes was mined and the relationship between ovarian function and ovarian tumorigenesis at the molecular level is discussed.

RESULTS
consistency of microarray data and q-pcr assays
the robustness and reliability of the mouse nia-15k cdna microarray platform has been demonstrated in our previous work  <cit>  and by others  <cit> . experimental design employed a common reference rna and replicate dye-swap. raw data was subjected to print-tip loess normalization, a numerical correction based on local deviations across the microarray surface aimed to counteract the inherent noise of these devices  <cit> . further adjustment consisted of inter-slide scale normalization, after which statistical comparisons were performed. the complete normalized dataset for  <dig>  cdna clones in  <dig> microarrays corresponding to  <dig> samples  is available as a supplementary spreadsheet  and has been deposited to the geo database  with the accession code gse <dig>  one of the  <dig> hybridization experiments was discarded because not meeting with minimal image quality parameters. figure  <dig>  panels a through c, shows microarray data comparison for expression of genes tsc <dig>  col3a <dig> and fubp <dig> in  <dig> strains assayed each in  <dig> microarray replicates. these genes were selected because they were present as multiple cdna clones in the nia-15k collection, so that intra-slide consistency could also be evaluated. the expression change , defined as the difference between log <dig> ratio averages of all clones in the 6x <dig> replicate arrays, was similar among the  <dig> genes. however, the adjusted p value was significant for the fubp <dig> gene only. additionally, quantitative-pcr  confirmation assays were performed for seven genes assessed in a previous mouse ovarian study, and for which primer pairs were available. three of these genes showed statistical significance after an anova test across the  <dig> mouse strains . the ct values for test and reference samples were corrected with the 18s-rrna as internal control transcript and then converted to log2-based ratios to compare with microarray results. as shown in figure 1d, the squared correlation between q-pcr and microarray platforms was r <dig> =  <dig> , a value over the range observed in a recent large-scale study aimed to validate microarray data using q-pcr  <cit> . microarray data roughly ranged from - <dig>  to + <dig>  while the correspondent q-pcr results ranged from - <dig>  to + <dig> . except for one data pair, out of  <dig> comparisons, the ratio direction  more than the absolute value, was consistent between both methodologies. additional file  <dig>  table  <dig>  shows detailed microarray log <dig> ratio values and ct values for the seven genes in all test and reference samples.

tumor and reproductive parameters correlated with ovarian gene expression
a preliminary anova analysis resulted in  <dig> cdna clones  with statistically significant differences  between  <dig> of any of the four mouse ovarian tissue profiles . these results simply indicate that transcriptional differences indeed occur among ovarian tissue across strains. thus, in order to add physiological meaning to this observation, the whole microarray dataset was subjected to a linear regression analysis with each of the continuous covariates shown in table  <dig>  a summary of regression results is shown in table  <dig>  using an adjusted p value < <dig>  as cut-off, a total of  <dig> clones that represented  <dig> known genes,  <dig> unknown genes,  <dig> transcribed locus and  <dig> expressed sequences were significantly correlated to  <dig> of the  <dig> traits analyzed. the overlap between the regression analysis and the anova test was  <dig> clones. the phenotype productive matings  did not result in any significantly correlated gene. the gene ontology  profile of the  <dig> known genes included “regulation of transcription” , “rna binding”  and “rna metabolism”  with the highest statistical significance in a hypergeometric test. notably, even though go terms are inherently redundant, the combined  <dig> functional groups corresponded to 26%  of known significant genes. the overall functional profile of the  <dig> genes list is detailed in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig>  ovarian tumor frequency  was the top correlated trait followed by number of litters . the relationship between the squared correlation coefficient  for each of the  <dig> otf correlated clones and its corresponding gene-expression shift is depicted in figure  <dig>  negative and positive correlation was observed for  <dig> and  <dig> clones, respectively. notably, a large fraction of strongly correlated genes  showed gene-expression shifts under  <dig> unit in the log <dig> ratio scale  which equals to less than 2-fold up- or down-regulation in the linear scale across the  <dig> strains. selected clones either with high significance, large expression shift or both are tagged with red and green dots in figure  <dig>  otf positively correlated genes included the unknown function h3055d <dig> clone, the bc <dig> clone coding for the kiaa <dig> protein presumably implicated in nuclear mrna splicing  <cit> , the heat shock proteins hspb <dig>  hsp90aa <dig> and dnajb <dig> involved in protein folding and cellular stress  <cit> , and the gene star , which mediates mitochondrial cholesterol transport for its conversion to pregnenolone  <cit> . on the other hand, genes negatively correlated with otf included ogt, coding for a n-acetylglucosamine transferase enzyme activity implicated in heat-stress response  <cit> , the mrna splicing genes hnrnpa2b <dig>  a possible early detection marker of lung cancer  <cit> , and sfrs <dig> which is overexpressed in breast tumors  <cit> . additional otf genes included 2310043n10rik corresponding to a virus-inducible non-coding rna  expressed in brain and several adult non-neuronal mouse tissues  <cit> , the two clones of malat <dig>  a long, non-coding metastasis-associated lung cancer transcript up-regulated various tumors including ovarian cancer  <cit> , and clk <dig> , involved in nuclear phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich proteins in the spliceosomal complex  <cit> .

functional analysis of genes associated both to otf and nl
discussion
complex phenotypes are the outcome of many genes interacting with each other and with endogenous or exogenous factors. mouse strains displaying phenotype variability allow interrogation on their molecular basis in a particular tissue or condition. in this report, the ovarian expression of roughly  <dig> genes  was significantly correlated to  <dig> of  <dig> mouse tumor and reproductive phenotypes assessed with a linear regression model. the predominant gene ontology  terms were “regulation of transcription”, “rna binding” and “rna metabolism” accounting for  <dig> of all correlated genes. a minor, but significant group was “ubiquitin cycle” with  <dig> genes. links to reproductive processes are described for aplp <dig>  chuk, dnaja <dig>  htt, pten, rps6kb <dig>  sf <dig>  spin <dig> and tnc in the go directory. rps6kb <dig> is involved in proliferation of granulosa cells in response to fsh  <cit> . rps6kb <dig> and chuk, in addition to nfkb <dig>  map3k <dig>  flna, kras, rap1a, and hspb <dig> belong to the map kinase signaling pathway which has been implicated in mammalian oocyte maturation and fertilization  <cit> . the correlation of kras , commonly mutated in various human tumors, with litter size  can be supported by its involvement in granulosa cell differentiation and ovulation  <cit> .

in a study on null foxo <dig> mice, a mutant displaying early ovarian hyperplasia due to synchronous primordial follicle activation,  <dig> genes  present in our 400-genes list were postulated as fertility factors  <cit> . star  protein was positively correlated to otf . star transports cholesterol into the mitochodria, a key process in steroid-hormone synthesis in all major steroidogenic tissues  <cit> . additional genes related to steroid metabolism and present in the 400-list included hmgcr , the major regulatory step in cholesterol synthesis; idi <dig>  involved in conversion of mevalonate into activated isoprene units, and lss  that catalyzes the cyclization of squalene- <dig> -epoxide to lanosterol. a recent work has implicated metabolic products of lanosterol in primordial folliculogenesis by regulation of oocyte meiosis and apoptosis  <cit> . other indirectly steroid-related gene was mbtps <dig>  a membrane-embedded zinc metalloprotease which activates signaling proteins involved in transcription induced by steroids  <cit> .

a large portion of the  <dig> list  was found to be associated both to spontaneous ovarian tumor frequency  and number of litters  as shown in table  <dig>  a link between otf and nl agrees with an increased risk of ovarian tumorigenesis due to successive menstrual cycles in women. in contrast, conditions that interrupt cycles block ovulations and thus reduce risk  <cit> . accordingly, a mouse strain displaying high nl has been subjected to a longer period without cycling than compared with a low nl strain. successive pregnancies and lactation may be responsible of this effect. we detected a set of  <dig> mouse genes that were positively correlated to nl, i.e. elevated expression levels were observed in strains showing high nl. thus, since a concomitant negative correlation was observed with ovarian tumor frequency , over-expression of these  <dig> genes set could be considered “protective”. by analogy, the  <dig> genes that were negatively correlated to nl, i.e. down-regulated in high nl mice, may have a role as “susceptibility” genes since they showed a parallel positive correlation with otf. importantly, high litter sizes  involve multiple simultaneous ovulations but no association was detected between otf and ls in our data. it may be hypothesized that the damage caused to the epithelial surface during a multiple-ovulation event can be repaired during subsequent pregnancy and lactation, a period without cycling and ovulations.

additional file  <dig> shows that  <dig> of the  <dig> otf–/nl+ genes are implicated either in normal or pathological ovarian processes. rna binding was the predominant go term in the 76-genes list reaching  <dig> genes. rna binding proteins have been implicated in mammalian germ cell development  <cit> . the genes cpsf <dig>  ddx <dig>  fubp <dig>  hnrpa2b <dig>  rbm <dig>  rbm <dig>  sfrs <dig> and sfrs <dig> share go terms  and a relationship with normal ovarian function or ovarian-related disease. some genes not related to rna metabolism but linked to ovarian function were correlated to otf–/nl+. these include ece <dig>  expressed in steroidogenic and follicular endothelial ovarian cells in a parallel fashion to corpus luteum maturation  <cit> , and the genes arnt and nfat <dig> that regulate the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor , an important angiogenesis modulator in normal and pathological conditions including ovarian malignancies  <cit> . arnt  binds the hypoxia inducible factor- <dig> alpha  to form a heterodimer that recognizes the vegf promoter  <cit> . arnt can alternatively bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  forming an ahr/arnt complex which controls fsh and lh concentrations in response to ahr ligands  <cit> . furthermore, down-regulation of nfat <dig>  parallels a decrease in vegf’s receptor vegfr <dig> and an increase in vegfr <dig> in hemangioma endothelial cells  <cit> .

additional regulators of vegf’s function in the otf–/nl+ list were the genes sfrs <dig> and rbm <dig>  the splicing factor sfrs <dig>  upregulates the anti-angiogenic vegf isoform, an alternative splicing product involving the 8th exon of vegf’s pre-mrna  <cit> . since sfrs <dig> displayed an otf–/nl+ correlation pattern, this is suggestive of an anti-angiogenic condition associated to multiparity and low ovarian tumor incidence. vegf levels itself were neither differentially expressed nor correlated to any phenotype in this study, but the cdc-like kinase  <dig> , which mediates sfrs <dig> activity on anti-angiogenic vegf levels  <cit> , was also part of the otf–/nl+ list . in addition, rbm <dig>  is able to alter the vegf-121/vegf- <dig> ratio in breast cancer cells  <cit> . rbm <dig> was originally described as an erα/β transcriptional coactivator  <cit> . analogous role has been reported for the dead-box rna helicases ddx <dig>  and ddx <dig> .  <cit> . ddx <dig> was in a otf–/nl+ fashion while ddx <dig> plus ddx26b, ddx3x and ddx <dig> were present in the overall 400-genes list.

regarding the otf+/nl– correlated genes, the predominant go term was “protein folding” including dnajb <dig>  hsp90aa <dig> and p4hb . dnajb <dig> is a member of the hsp <dig> co-chaperone protein family of which its drosophyla homolog participates in oogenesis  <cit> . related hsp- <dig> genes dnaja <dig>  dnajb <dig>  and dnajc <dig> were present in the overall 400-genes list. hsp90aa <dig> expression is up-regulated in ovarian endometriosis  <cit>  while p4hb is involved in post-translational modifications of procollagen synthesis  <cit> . other transcripts with otf+/nl– correlation were spin <dig> , a protein that associates to cpeb, a rna-binding protein implicated in polyadenylation during meiotic progression in oocytes  <cit> , and the transcription factor cited <dig>  reported as a fsh regulated gene in human granulosa cells  <cit> .

all the five phenotypes studied are complex and many causal effects are certainly involved. it is quite possible that a large fraction of correlated transcripts may be simply bystanders but not lie behind the measured phenotype. of the  <dig> genes listed in additional file  <dig>  seventeen are classified under the go term “regulation of transcription”. these may be considered “master genes”, i.e. encoding for protein products that somehow interact with dna regulatory sequences or transcriptional multiprotein complexes thus modulating the transcriptional activity of downstream genes. among the otf–/nl+ correlated genes with roles in regulation of transcription, we identified fubp <dig>  rbm <dig> and arnt which are directly linked to ovarian biology or disease . fubp <dig> encodes a ssdna binding protein that activates the “far upstream element” of c-myc thus stimulating its transcription. interestingly, promoter regions of the otf–/nl+ genes ccnl <dig>  clk <dig>  coq10a, ddx <dig>  ict <dig>  zc3h11a and zc3h7a were found to contain binding sites for arnt . in addition, the genes hnrpdl, sltm, tardbp, ccnl <dig>  ccnl <dig>  dmtf <dig>  mll <dig>  mycbp <dig>  nfat <dig>  suv420h <dig>  and 1810007m <dig> display diverse roles in cancer and developmental processes . special mention deserve the c-myc binding protein mycbp <dig>  the gene sltm, which has been described as modulator of estrogen induced transcription, and the cyclins ccnl <dig> and ccnl <dig> which are transcriptional regulators of pre-mrna splicing.

phenotypic information obtained from independent studies on animals need to be integrated in order to reliably compare results across different mice colonies and laboratory set-ups. the sources of phenotypic data used in the present study are metadatabases in which uniformity criteria and manual curation has been imposed on assembled records. the mouse tumor biology database  contains both spontaneous and induced tumor information for over  <dig> inbred strains, which is primarily extracted from the literature, from tumor pathology images submitted by investigators, and from routine animal health screenings of mouse colonies at jackson laboratory  <cit> . then, is curated with the help of natural language processing tools to cope with increasing amounts of phenotype information in the literature  <cit> . similarly, the mouse phenome database  has developed standards for deposition of phenotypic data of mice including strain purity, study design, animal age and statistical power. contributors are requested to provide complete measurement descriptions, experimental protocols as well as housing, diet and health status of animals. mpd curates data and computes summary statistics for each measurement in all strains  <cit> .

results presented here were obtained with a linear regression analysis. however, interplaying gene networks linked to phenotypes may not necessarily follow linear relationships with regard to transcript levels. recently, a few reports have attempted to identify non-monotone or non-linear phenotype-transcriptome associations. lin et al.  proposed the coefficient of multiple determination  of a natural cubic spline regression model  <cit> . in a related work, three correlation methods  were compared to analyze co-expressed genes. hoeffding’s d dependence measure was found to be the best suited to identify nonlinear and non-monotonic associations  <cit> . these types of analytical approaches are needed to uncover causal phenotype-transcriptome connections that do not follow obvious linear behaviors.

finally, since one of the strains showed a much higher otf than the other three, we were interested in search for stronger gene links with this phenotype in the swr strain. a t-test conducted between swr versus the remaining  <dig> strains resulted in  <dig> statistically significant clones . of these,  <dig> clones were common with the regression test while  <dig> were coincident with the anova test. the overlap between the  <dig> tests resulted in a list of  <dig> clones having a functional profile that resembled the terms described in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig> for the regression results. on the other hand,  <dig> clones were exclusive in the t-test. reduction of the latter subset resulted in  <dig> unique gene identities which were subjected to a go analysis summarized in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig>  the combined 10-terms list suggests the involvement of intracellular vesicle traffic, protein sorting and actin cytoskeleton dynamics in the observed high otf of swr strain. indeed, oocyte meiotic maturation involves events related to spindle assembly. in somatic cells, chromosome segregation errors during mitosis may contribute to cancer development and progression  <cit> . the genes app, aplp <dig> and appbp <dig>  all related to the amyloid beta precursor protein, were recurrent in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig>  the well known involvement of amyloid beta protein in alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis may actually be due to a chromosomal instability process  <cit> . analogous mechanisms may partly explain the high otf observed in swr mice.

CONCLUSIONS
this work describes statistically significant variation in ovarian gene expression of four commonly studied mouse strains. we found that over 60% of these differences are linked to the biological variability observed in spontaneous ovarian tumor rates and reproductive parameters across strains. if nl is equivalent to multiparity, the inverse relationship detected between genes correlated to otf and nl points to a protective effect of successive pregnancies. post-transcriptional control of ovarian angiogenesis, folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation seems to be major contributors to this effect. conversely, overexpression of protein folding genes might be considered as a susceptibility factor. these findings, in addition to the lack of association between otf and ls -a measure of multiple ovulation- support repetitive menstrual cycling instead of repetitive ovulations as an important contributor to ovarian tumorigenesis. further experimental research as well as development of bioinformatic and statistical tools to uncover complex phenotype-transcriptome associations is needed.
