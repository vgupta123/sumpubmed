BACKGROUND
in drosophila, independent groups of small rnas with overlapping function regulate gene expression using transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. piwi-interacting rnas  are found, most notably, in the germ line where they inhibit transposon  expression by inducing heterochromatin formation at complementary genomic tn insertion sites . micro rnas  and endogenous small interfering rnas  are expressed ubiquitously; however mirnas frequently inhibit translation of protein coding genes  <cit> , while esirnas are suggested to inhibit tn mobility in drosophila somatic cells  and potentially target mrnas for degradation using a cytoplasmic rnai mechanism  <cit> . while piwi mediated tn repression in germ cells and translational inhibition by mirnas have been actively investigated, the molecular details of how esirnas regulate their targets have not been described.

twenty-one nucleotide  esirnas are generated from double stranded  precursor rnas by dicer- <dig>  and function through association with argonaute- <dig>  in drosophila somatic cells . esirnas produced in drosophila tissues derive generally from cis-natural antisense transcripts , inverted repeat containing single stranded rnas ), and retrotns  <cit> . in contrast, drosophila culture cells generate esirnas predominantly from long terminal repeat  retrotransposons  and hps; few cis-nat derived esirnas are observed in s <dig> cell derived datasets  <cit> . multi-copy ltr and non-ltr retrotns generate esirnas that map the entire length of these retrotns. in contrast, hp-derived esirnas arise from two loci, defined esi <dig> and esi <dig>  within drosophila annotated transcripts cr <dig> and cg <dig>  respectively. esi <dig> and esi <dig> contain multiple inverted repeats, allowing formation of complex dsrna secondary structures. these loci produce multiple esirnas, the most predominant termed esi <dig>  and esi <dig> . differences between retrotn and hp-derived esirna biogenesis have not been previously investigated.


drosophila ltr and non-ltr retrotns are transcribed in both the sense  and antisense  directions from rna polymerase ii-like promoters  <cit> . s retrotn transcripts are generally polyadenylated while as transcripts are less likely to contain a poly tail  <cit> . because retrotns are polyadenylated, the 3’ ends of potential esirna precursors are processed by the core cleavage complex  containing cpsf <dig>  cpsf <dig> and symplekin,  since this complex cleaves all eukaryotic mrnas. potential connections between mrna 3’ end processing and esirna biogenesis are intriguing and have not been previously described.

esirnas regulate tns and additional targets via multiple pathways: a canonical cytoplasmic post-transcriptional rnai pathway in which esirnas hybridize to target mrnas resulting in translational repression, and/or transcriptional regulation by induction of heterochromatin in the nucleus. mrna targets of hp derived esirnas have been identified  <cit>  and transcript levels of these targets are elevated in dcr <dig> mutant flies,  <cit>  supporting the post-transcriptional model. evidence is mounting that tn derived esirnas also mediate heterochromatin formation in drosophila nuclei . dcr <dig> catalytic mutants regulate position effect variegation  <cit> , a measure of heterochromatin formation  <cit> . additionally, dcr <dig> promotes transcription of heat shock genes  <cit>  and has been observed in the nuclei of drosophila larvae  <cit> . these data are consistent with a nuclear pool of dcr <dig> that could contribute to transcriptional regulation by induction of heterochromatin in addition to cytoplasmic dcr <dig> acting in the rnai pathway.

to define connections between differential retrotn and hp-derived esirna processing and cellular location, and to investigate the potential link between mrna 3’ end cleavage and esirna biogenesis, interactions between ccc components and dcr <dig> were characterized and esirnas in control and rnai-depleted drosophila tissue culture cells were analyzed. these experiments revealed that dcr <dig> and the ccc interact, but only in the nucleus, and that the ccc indirectly regulates esirna biogenesis by modulating dsrna precursor levels. additionally, retrotn- and hp-derived esirnas are physically distinct and occupy different subcellular compartments. retrotn-derived esirnas and their precursors are retained in the nucleus while hp-derived esirnas and their precursors are exported to the cytoplasm. collectively, these data support a model in which esirnas regulate gene expression and retrotn mobility via diverse compartmentalized mechanisms.

RESULTS
mrna 3’ end processing factor symplekin interacts with dcr2
to identify potential novel ccc binding partners, we immunoprecipitated endogenous symplekin from crude drosophila culture cell nuclear extracts and identified co-immunoprecipitating proteins by mass spectrometry . the most abundant symplekin interacting proteins in this assay were known ccc components cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> and additional mrna 3’ end processing proteins cpsf <dig>  wdr <dig> ,  <cit>  cpsf <dig> , and cstf <dig>  <cit> . surprisingly, dcr <dig> and hsc <dig>  proteins known to act in sirna biogenesis  <cit>  also interacted with symplekin . to confirm this interaction, we performed the reverse immunoprecipitation. dcr <dig> co-immunoprecipitated symplekin and additional ccc factor components, cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig>  and r2d <dig>  a known dcr <dig> binding partner  <cit>  . additionally, endogenous dcr <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with ha-tagged symplekin , cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig>  stably expressed in dmel- <dig> cells. when endogenous dcr <dig> was immunoprecipitated from these cells, ha-cpsf <dig> and ha-cpsf <dig> co-immunoprecipitated indicating that dcr <dig> interacts with the ccc .fig.  <dig> dcr <dig> interacts with the n-terminal region of symplekin a dcr <dig> co-immunoprecipitates  with the core cleavage complex  and r2d <dig> in drosophila culture cell crude nuclear extract. antibodies used for immunoprecipitation  are shown above. antibodies used for western blot  are listed to the left. ‘beads’ and ‘α-myc’ are negative controls. no sample was loaded in lanes labeled ‘none.’ b dcr <dig> binds symplekin amino acids 1- <dig> and not amino acids 272- <dig>  exogenously expressed ha-tagged symplekin deletions are defined above the blots. other labels are as in a. wb of full length symplekin and symplekin mutant ips are the top figure while co-ip of symp with dcr <dig> is shown in the bottom wb. c dcr <dig> binds exogenously expressed ccc components cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig>  ha-tagged, full-length cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> were iped from drosophila culture cells stably expressing these proteins. dcr <dig> co-ips with both cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> was identified by western blot . other labels are as in a. dcr <dig> was iped from these cells. co-ip of ha-cpsf <dig> and ha-cpsf <dig> was identified by western blot . controls are as in a. d ccc components cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> do not interact with dcr <dig> in the absence of full length symplekin. wb of symp ip  and wb of symp  ip  from symplekin rnai-depleted samples are shown. wb are labeled as in a





to determine which region of symplekin interacts with dcr <dig>  we immunoprecipitated stably expressed ha-tagged symplekin deletions from drosophila culture cell lysates. the n-terminal region of symplekin  clearly interacts with endogenous dcr <dig> while the c-terminal region  does not . reciprocal immunoprecipitation of endogenous dcr <dig> reveals co-immunoprecipitation of ha-tagged symp  .

to further investigate dcr2-ccc interactions, we used a system in which n- and c-terminal symplekin mutants are expressed in endogenous symplekin rnai-depleted cells. ccc formation is mediated by the c-termini of symplekin, cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig>  <cit> . therefore, exogenous ha-symp  does not precipitate endogenous cpsf <dig> or cpsf <dig> when full-length endogenous symplekin is knocked down . unlike the interactions observed with full-length symplekin, dcr <dig> does not immunoprecipitate cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> under conditions when only ha-symp  is present . additionally, while cccs are formed in cells expressing ha-symp , very little cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> interact with dcr <dig> in these cells . these data suggest that the symplekin n-terminal region interacts with dcr <dig> while cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> are present in this complex via interaction with the c-terminal region of symplekin  <cit> .

the dcr2-ccc complex is functionally distinct from the ccc
cpsf <dig>  cpsf <dig> and symplekin tightly interact in the absence of rna to form the ccc  <cit> . dcr <dig> and symplekin also interact in the absence of rna . when one member of the ccc is depleted, levels of the other factors are dramatically reduced  <cit> . to determine if dcr <dig> is a bona fide ccc component, we investigated symplekin and cpsf <dig> levels in a dcr <dig> knockdown. when dcr <dig> is depleted, symplekin and cpsf <dig> levels are unchanged . dcr <dig> levels remain constant when cpsf <dig> or symplekin are knocked down .fig.  <dig> dcr <dig> is not involved in mrna 3’ end processing a dcr <dig> depletion does not affect ccc component protein levels. rnai-depleted proteins are listed above the blot. antibodies used for wb are listed to the left. b dcr <dig> rnai-depletion does not cause mrna 3’ end misprocessing. an s <dig> nuclease assay was used to map histone 2a 3’ ends . knockdowns are shown at the top. potential mrna 3’ end products are shown to the left: rt is the read-through misprocessed product, the open arrow marks the region of other misprocessed products, and the black arrow defines the properly processed product. cpsf <dig> is shown as a positive control. c rt-qpcr using primers that amplify misprocessed sop mrnas  reveals very little misprocessed sop in dcr <dig> knockdown samples. knockdowns are shown on the x-axis. degree of misprocessing = log <dig> ). error bars represent one standard deviation. d dcr <dig> rnai-depletion does not cause 3’ end misprocessing and read-through transcription. rna-seq reads mapping to and downstream of the ip3k <dig> gene are shown in red. maximal read counts for ip3k <dig> are shown on the y-axis




because ccc depletion causes 3’ end misprocessing and dcr <dig> interacts with the ccc, we wanted to determine the effects of dcr <dig> depletion on mrna 3’ end processing. first, we mapped the 3’ ends of endogenous histone 2a  mrnas in a dcr <dig> depleted sample using an s <dig> nuclease protection assay. no differences in mrna 3’ end processing were observed between dcr <dig> knockdown and negative control samples . dcr <dig> depletion does not cause misprocessing of histone mrna 3’ ends as is observed when ccc components are knocked down   <cit> . additionally, an rt-qpcr assay  <cit>  was used to assess the effects of dcr <dig> knockdown on mrna 3’ end misprocessing of polyadenylated genes. very little misprocessing of a canonical polyadenylated mrna  was observed in a dcr <dig> depleted sample as compared to the positive symplekin knockdown control; compare ~4-fold in the dcr <dig> knockdown to ~85-fold in the symplekin rnai-depleted sample . finally, visual inspection of mapped rna-seq reads from control , dcr <dig> and symplekin knockdown samples reveals mrna 3’ end misprocessing is only present in the symplekin rnai-depleted sample; dcr <dig> and lacz knockdown samples show no or few rna-seq reads mapping downstream of the ip3k <dig> gene . these data support a model in which dcr <dig> is not required for mrna 3’ end processing and that the dcr2-ccc complex is functionally distinct from the ccc as mrna 3’ end processing is unaffected in the absence of dcr <dig> 

dcr <dig> interacts with the ccc in the nucleus
to investigate subcellular localization of the dcr2-ccc complex, dmel- <dig> cells were first effectively separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using a refined fractionation technique . western blots reveal pools of dcr <dig> and symplekin in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm . while dcr <dig> is primarily cytoplasmic and symplekin is generally nuclear in accordance with their roles in rnai and mrna 3’ end processing, respectively, an appreciable amount of each protein is found in the complementary subcellular compartment . additionally, immunofluorescence with antibodies to the endogenous proteins confirms the presence of both symplekin and dcr <dig> in the nucleus . this assay also shows symplekin and dcr <dig> in the cytoplasm, consistent with their roles in cytoplasmic polyadenylation and rnai, respectively  <cit> .fig.  <dig> dcr <dig> only interacts with the ccc in the nucleus. a dcr <dig> is present in the nucleus. wb of refined nuclear  and cytoplasmic extracts  reveals a nuclear pool of dcr <dig> . b endogenous dcr <dig> co-ips the ccc and r2d <dig> from refined nes . no interaction between dcr <dig> and the ccc is observed in ce . antibodies used for ip are shown above. antibodies used for wb are listed left. ‘beads’ and ‘α-myc’ are negative controls. a lighter exposure of the r2d <dig> wb is shown at the bottom of the top ne group




immunoprecipitations of endogenous dcr <dig> from refined dmel- <dig> nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions show that nuclear dcr <dig> co-immunoprecipitates the ccc and r2d <dig> , while cytoplasmic dcr <dig> only interacts with r2d <dig> ; no interaction between cytoplasmic dcr <dig> and the ccc is observed. nuclear symplekin co-immunoprecipitates dcr <dig> and other ccc components, cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig>  but not r2d <dig> . additionally, cytoplasmic symplekin does not interact with dcr <dig> . together these data support a model in which dcr <dig> forms distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes.

the ccc indirectly regulates esirna abundance
to investigate the role of the ccc in esirna biogenesis, cpsf <dig>  symplekin and dcr <dig> were first independently rnai-depleted from drosophila culture cells. untreated dmel- <dig> cells  or those treated with double stranded rna to a non-drosophila gene  acted as controls. rna was then isolated and separated into large  and small  fractions, rrna depleted and sequenced . rna-seq reads were mapped to the drosophila genome and transcriptome using rum,  <cit>  while small rna -seq reads were mapped and analyzed using a novel pipeline termed sequence mapping, annotation, and counting for smrnas or smacr . only sirnas and mirnas were further analyzed. interestingly, ~40% of rna-seq reads mapped to multiple locations in the genome , although the samples were depleted of rrnas . also, the percentage of non-unique reads changes significantly with knockdown of dcr <dig> and symplekin . these data support previous claims that dmel- <dig> culture cells have undergone tn expansion  and indicate that increased numbers of tns may contribute to higher overall expression of repetitive sequences and abundance of dcr <dig> dependent sirnas. tn expansion makes drosophila culture cells an excellent system for studying esirnas biogenesis.

we first assessed how depletion of dcr <dig> and ccc components cpsf <dig> and symplekin affect sirna and mirna dynamics in drosophila culture cells. first, reads per million mapped  pre-mirnas, non-coding rnas, mirnas, tn-mapping esirnas, and hairpin structure-mapping ) esirnas, were added to give the total smrna pool for each sample. the percentages of mirnas, tn-mapping and hp-mapping esirnas were then calculated for each sample. normalizing to the total number of smrnas is important as symplekin, cpsf <dig> and dcr <dig> knockdown samples have decreasing amounts of total smrnas . to evaluate ccc and dcr <dig> based differences in mirna, tn-mapping, and hp-mapping esirna levels, the percentage of smrnas in each group was divided by the percentage of each smrna group in the lacz control . when dcr <dig> is rnai-depleted, the percentage of esirnas mapping to tns and hps decreases significantly while the portion of mirnas in the pool increases . biogenesis of hp esirnas is more dependent on dcr <dig> than esirnas processed from tn precursors, as dcr <dig> depletion reduces hp esirnas ~ <dig>  fold compared to the control, while tn esirnas are only reduced ~ <dig>  fold . surprisingly, depletion of ccc components cpsf <dig> and symplekin has differential effects on tn and hp derived esirnas; the proportion of tn derived esirnas generally increases while the number of esirnas generated from hps trends downward . knockdown of symplekin and cpsf <dig> may slightly reduce the number of mirnas in these samples . importantly, rnai-depletion of cpsf <dig> and symplekin show similar trends while the dcr <dig> knockdown displays a different molecular phenotype. together these data support a model in which esirnas are differentially processed from tn and hp precursor molecules in drosophila culture cells.fig.  <dig> ccc depletion differentially affects esirna biogenesis from retrotns and inverted repeat loci. a ratios of percent mirnas, transpsoson -derived and hairpin -derived sirnas from symplekin , cpsf <dig> , and dcr <dig>  knockdown samples are shown. percentages are the total mirna, tn or hp normalized read count ) divided by the total normalized read count . the percents of each smrna group were normalized to the lacz control. error bars represent one standard deviation. b cpsf <dig> and symplekin rnai-depleted samples are represented as in a. rpmms of esirnas mapping to hp loci esi <dig> and esi <dig> in symp and cpsf <dig> depleted samples were normalized to corresponding esirnas in lacz samples . rpmms of rna-seq reads mapping to sense  precursors of esi <dig> and esi <dig> rna in these knockdowns were also normalized to corresponding rna-seq reads in lacz samples . error bars are as in a. c rpmms of esirnas mapping to dm <dig>  mdg <dig> and jockey retrotns in symp and cpsf <dig> depleted samples were normalized to corresponding esirnas in lacz samples . rpmms of rna-seq reads mapping to sense  and antisense  precursors of dm <dig>  mdg <dig>  jockey transcripts in these knockdowns were also normalized to corresponding rna-seq reads in lacz samples . error bars are as in a





to investigate potential explanations for the observed differences between tn and hp derived esirna levels and differential effects of dcr <dig> and ccc factor depletion on esirnas biogenesis, we first examined esirna and precursor levels for both hp loci  and individual retrotns: dm <dig>  mdg <dig> and jockey, as compared to the lacz control . normalized esi 1/ <dig> precursor and esirna levels in each knockdown sample were divided by the number of esi 1/ <dig> precursor and esirnas in the lacz control. esi 1/ <dig> precursor levels decrease when cpsf <dig> and symplekin are knocked down and we observe a corresponding decrease of esirnas in these samples . the number of esirnas mapping to mdg <dig> and jockey increase in response to ccc depletion while esirnas generated from dm <dig> decrease in these samples . retrotn esirna precursors consist of hybridized s and as retrotn transcripts  <cit> . we previously reported that both s and as retrotn transcript levels are elevated in dcr <dig> depleted cells  <cit> . knockdown of ccc components symplekin or cpsf <dig> results in little to no change in sense dm <dig>  mdg <dig> or jockey transcript abundance, while the corresponding as transcript levels are altered significantly . interestingly, retrotn esirna levels correlate with perturbations in as transcript levels in these samples . previously, we hypothesized that the total amount of retrotn dcr <dig> substrate in dmel- <dig> cells is determined by as transcript levels as these tend to be limiting  <cit> . therefore, changes in retrotn derived esirnas levels partially correspond to alterations in retrotn dcr <dig> substrate levels. but, because changes in esi 1/ <dig> and retrotn esirna levels do not mirror alterations in substrate abundance , additional direct affects of ccc-dcr <dig> interaction are plausible and require further investigation.

we hypothesize that retrotn-derived dsrnas in wild type dmel- <dig> cells have a simple secondary structure, generally having blunt-ends with complementary s and as strands as transcription is initiated from multiple internal locations . theoretically, hairpins, having multiple inverted repeats can hybridize to form an infinite number of complex secondary structures . to determine if retrotn and hp esirna precursor structures are altered by depletion of ccc factors, we investigated 3’ end misprocessing of retrotn mdg <dig> and hp esi <dig>  bedgraphs representing rna-seq s and as reads mapping to mdg1{} <dig> and surrounding sequences in cpsf <dig>  symplekin and lacz depleted samples show no reads mapping beyond the 3’ ends of mdg1{} <dig>  indicating that extended retrotn 3’ utr phenotypes are not observed when ccc components are rnai-depleted . this result is inconsistent with 3’ utr molecular phenotypes observed for mrnas . however, rna-seq reads mapping downstream of esi2-containing mrna cg <dig> and neighboring gene cg <dig> are readily detectable in symplekin and cpsf <dig> knockdowns , consistent with other mrnas in ccc rnai-depleted samples . the presence of read-through cg <dig> mrnas complementary to esi <dig> could potentially alter esi <dig> structure and give rise to additional dsrna dcr <dig> substrates. together, these data indicate that ccc knockdown does not change retrotn dcr <dig> substrate structure, while symplekin and cpsf <dig> rnai-depletion may indirectly lead to additional esi <dig> dsrnas formed with as sequences. inefficient cleavage of esi <dig> dsrnas composed of both s and as rnas could provide one explanation for the lower esi <dig> esirna levels observed in cpsf <dig> and symplekin knockdowns .fig.  <dig> ccc factor rnai-depletion may alter hairpin secondary structure a potential secondary structures for tns  and hps . complementary regions are shown in green and magenta. b depletion of ccc components does not cause 3’ end misprocessing of retrotn transcripts. s and as rna-seq reads from lacz , symplekin, and cpsf <dig> rnai-depleted samples were visualized using the ucsc genome browser and are overlayed. schematic of a genomic region containing a mdg <dig> element is shown above the bedgraph. no unique reads are observed flanking the retrotn. c cg <dig> read-through transcripts could hybridize to esi <dig> rnas in ccc factor knockdowns. symplekin , cpsf <dig>  depleted samples and lacz  control rna mapping to this region are shown. rna-seq data is displayed in the top two panels, sirna-seq data is displayed in the bottom panel




hp and tn-derived esirnas are physically distinct
initial characterization of sirnas and mirnas in dcr <dig> rnai-depleted, ccc knockdown, and control samples included using smacr to filter smrnas by length, 3’, and 5’ base. generally, there is little variation between depleted samples and few statistically significant differences between dcr <dig>  cpsf <dig> and symplekin rnai-depleted samples, and controls . one notable exception is that dcr <dig> depletion reduces the percentage of 21 nt tn and hairpin-derived esirnas, while increasing esirnas of other sizes . knockdown of dcr <dig> does not affect mirna length distributions , indicating that this molecular phenotype is specific to dcr <dig> substrates. this trend is not observed for 3’ and 5’ base preference in dcr <dig> knockdown samples . ccc factor knockdowns have negligible affects on esirna size and end nucleotide preference supporting a model that cpsf <dig> and symplekin do not directly affect dcr <dig> catalytic activity . very few statistically significant differences in smrna length, 3’, or 5’ base are observed between untreated cells and those treated with non-specific dsrna  suggesting that inducing the rnai response does not affect smrna size or end nucleotide preference.

examination of length differences between esirnas and mirnas in control samples reveals that mirnas are almost equally distributed among  <dig>   <dig> and 23 nt lengths, while 21 nt is the dominant length of tn and hp-derived esirnas . unexpectedly, variations in length distributions were also observed between tn and hp-derived esirnas. approximately 75% of esirnas generated from tns are 21 nt with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 23-mers almost evenly comprising the remaining 25% . in contrast, ~62% of hp-derived esirnas are 21 nt and ~23% are 22 nt; the proportion of 22-mers in the hp generated esirna pool is significantly greater than for tn-derived esirnas .fig.  <dig> retrotn- and hp-derived esirnas have different physical characteristics. a percentage of mirnas , transposons , and hairpin  mapping esirnas in the lacz control sample that are 19- <dig> nts. error bars represent one standard deviation. b percentage of mirnas, transposons, and hairpin mapping esirnas in the lacz control sample that have a 3’ g, a, t, or c. colors and error bars are as in a. c percentage of mirnas, transposons, and hairpin mapping esirnas in the lacz control sample that have a 5’ g, a, t, or c. colors and error bars are as in a





dramatic differences between 3’ base preference are also observed for mirnas and esirnas. the 3’ nucleotide is a for ~75% of mirnas while c, g and t occur much less frequently at this position . tn generated esirnas also predominantly end in an a, but the 3’ nucleotide is more frequently c, g and t than for mirnas; . interestingly, the 3’ base of hp-derived esirnas is g more than 50% of the time, a is observed for ~30% of these esirnas, and t and c are present less often at the 3’ end . therefore, while the tn- and hp-derived esirna 3’ nt is generally more diverse than for mirnas, significant differences are observed between esirnas. 5’ nucleotide distributions are more similar for all three smrna classes. c is the most abundant 5’ nucleotide for mirnas and esirnas, while g and a are also frequently observed . t is the least populous 5’ nucleotide for mirnas and esirnas . collectively, these data indicate that esirnas processed from tns and hps have diverse physical characteristics and support a model in which these two precursors are differentially processed in dmel- <dig> cells.

retrotn precursors and esirnas are retained in the nucleus
to investigate potential differences in subcellular localization of retrotn and hp dsrnas, drosophila culture cells were separated into refined nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions , total rna was isolated and rt-qpcr was performed on multiple orfs of dm <dig>  mdg <dig>  blood, jockey and juan retrotn rnas, and esi <dig> and esi <dig> containing substrate transcripts cg <dig> and cr <dig>  respectively. a control canonical mrna, gapdh, is slightly enriched in the nucleus . surprisingly, the retrotn transcripts are overwhelmingly enriched in the nucleus as compared to the gapdh control showing between ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> fold enhancement depending on which retrotn orf was targeted by rt-qpcr . these samples were normalized to no rt controls to ensure that contaminating genomic dna was not responsible for the observed nuclear enhancement of retrotn rnas. cg <dig> and cr <dig> are not dramatically enriched in either the cytoplasm or nucleus, resembling the gapdh mrna control .fig.  <dig> retrotns dsrna precursors are nuclear retained. rt-qpcr of retrotn and esi1/ <dig> mrnas isolated from refined nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions reveals nuclear retention of retrotn esirnas precursors.  retrotn rt-qpcr targets are shown on the x-axis. fold change is the average of three experiments and is calculated as 2-ct).  cg <dig> is the esi <dig> precursor. cr <dig> is the esi <dig> precursor mrna. gapdh is the control transcript. error bars represent one standard deviation. b taqman qpcr of retrotn and esi1/ <dig> derived esirnas isolated from refined nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions shows nuclear retention of retrotn derived esirnas. labels, calculations, and error bars are as in a. c rt-qpcr of esirna precursors in symplekin, cpsf <dig> or dcr <dig> knockdowns shows nuclear retention of both hp and retrotn dsrna precursors. labels, calculations, and error bars are as in a. rnai-depletion is defined as in fig. 4





to assess the cellular localization of retrotn, esi <dig> and esi2-derived esirnas, we measured levels of the most abundant esirnas from these precursors with custom taqman assays. a cytoplasmic mirna control  is ~ <dig>  fold enriched in the cytoplasm . strikingly, both dm <dig> and mdg1-derived esirnas are enriched in the nucleus while esi <dig> and esi1-derived esirnas  localize to the cytoplasm . these data correlate with nuclear enrichment of retrotns and nuclear export of hps . together these data support a model in which retrotn dsrna precursors are retained and processed in the nucleus while single stranded esi <dig> and esi <dig> precursors are exported to the cytoplasm for dcr2-dependent generation of esirnas.

to investigate the role of ccc components symplekin and cpsf <dig> in cellular localization of dcr <dig> substrates, a subset of retrotn and hp transcript levels was assessed by rt-qpcr in refined nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from ccc factor rnai-depleted samples. dcr <dig> knockdown has marginal effects on cellular localization of cg <dig>  dm <dig>  and mdg <dig> rnas as compared to the gapdh control. in contrast, symplekin and cpsf <dig> rna-depletions cause slight nuclear retention of hp cg <dig> and further nuclear enrichment of retrotn transcripts as compared to gapdh . while both the cpsf <dig> and symplekin knockdowns show similar trends, the effects observed when cpsf <dig> is rnai-depleted are more dramatic than when symplekin is rnai-depleted. as both cg <dig> and cr <dig>  and retrotn sense transcripts are polyadenylated , we hypothesize that mrna 3’ end processing defects in the ccc knockdown samples affect cellular localization of these dcr <dig> substrates.

discussion
since the discovery of endogenous small interfering  in drosophila, very little progress in understanding their biogenesis and molecular mechanisms of action has been made. here we provide evidence that components of two major rna processing pathways, 3’ end processing and esirna biogenesis, interact in drosophila somatic cells, a connection not previously reported. importantly, we also show that esirnas processed from retrotns have different physical characteristics than those generated from hairpins. double-stranded retrotn rnas are retained in the nucleus while esi1/ <dig> hps are exported to the cytoplasm. together these data support a novel model in which retrotns and hps, both double stranded rnas cleaved by dcr <dig>  are differentially processed in drosophila somatic cells. this is the first evidence that precursor secondary structures potentially contribute to dcr <dig> activity in vivo.

mrna 3’ end processing performed by the ccc is co-transcriptional and therefore occurs in the nucleus  <cit> . the rna pol ii ctd phosphatase ssu <dig> interacts with the n-terminal region of symplekin to direct processing of mrnas with a 3’ poly tail  <cit>  and with the stem loop binding protein for replication dependent histone mrnas . here, we show that this n-terminal region of symplekin can also interact with esirna processing factor dcr <dig>  in the nuclear compartment , although, dcr <dig> is not required for proper mrna 3’ end formation . the symplekin c-terminal region binds cpsf <dig> and cpsf <dig> to form the ccc  <cit> , therefore leaving the n-terminal region free to bridge the ccc and other cellular factors. while previous work shows that regulation of tns by pirnas in the drosophila germline is a nuclear process  and researchers have documented a nuclear pool of dcr <dig> that associates with heat shock loci and transcription machinery in drosophila  <cit> , potential nuclear functions of dcr <dig> in drosophila somatic cells have not been extensively investigated  <cit> . our data support a model in which the n-terminal region of symplekin mediates dcr2-ccc complex formation, but only when the ccc is not actively engaged in co-transcriptional mrna 3’ end processing .fig.  <dig> esirnas are differnentially processed in d. melanogaster cells. data support a model in which double stranded retrotn transcripts are retained and processed to esirnas in the nucleus while rnas containing inverted repeats are exported and processed in the cytoplasm. dcr <dig> interacts with the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of symplekin in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm




to understand the functional implications of ccc-dcr <dig> interactions, esirna and precursor levels were measured in symplekin and cpsf <dig> rnai-depleted samples. globally, we observe increased levels of tn-derived esirnas and decreased hp-derived esirnas in ccc factor knockdowns . examination of specific retrotns and esi1/ <dig> precursors reveals that changes in esirna levels correlate to shifts in precursor abundance in symplekin and cpsf <dig> knockdowns . as we hypothesize that dsrna retrotn precursor levels are determined as transcript abundance  <cit> , more as transcript would lead to an increase in dcr <dig> substrates , while decreased as transcript would result in less dcr <dig> substrate. esi1/ <dig> precursors consist of only one s mrna. therefore, hp dcr <dig> substrate concentration is determined by only cg <dig> and cr <dig> levels. once again, the observed lower esi1/ <dig> esirna levels in ccc factor depleted cells correlate with decreased cg <dig> and cr <dig> transcripts in these samples . these data support a model in which esirna levels are partially influenced by dcr <dig> substrate concentration. substrate levels are affected by ccc factor rnai-depletion indicating that symplekin and cpsf <dig> indirectly determine esirna abundance. because symplekin and cpsf <dig> rnai-depleted samples follow the same trends, we concluded that the ccc is involved in this process.

while hp and retrotn esirna levels correlate to s and as transcript abundance, the number of esirnas is always less than the dcr <dig> substrate concentration in symplekin and cpsf <dig> knockdowns indicating that additional mechanisms must be modulating esirna levels in these samples. although, dcr <dig> cleavage site selectivity is unaffected in ccc factor rnai-depleted samples , dcr <dig> activity could be altered by interaction with the ccc. an additional hypothesis for the observed molecular phenotypes is inefficient nuclear export of retrotn and hp rnas in symplekin and cpsf <dig> rnai-depleted samples. ccc component knockdowns cause global mrna 3’ end processing defects  and how this misprocessing affects cellular localization of retrotn dsrnas is unknown. however, previous work shows that less polyadenylated rnas are not effectively exported from the nucleus  <cit> . additionally, 3’ end misprocessing of rnas generated from the esi <dig> locus  might lead to changes in secondary structure that unpredictably affect nuclear export. inefficient nuclear export of hp rnas with modified 3’ ends might not change total precursor levels, but could result in less esi2-derived esirnas since cytoplasmic hp precursor levels would be reduced. when symplekin and cpsf <dig> are rnai-depleted, both hp and retrotn dsrnas are enriched in the nucleus  supporting the hypothesis that non-polyadenylated rnas are retained in the nucleus. taken together, these data support a model in which the ccc indirectly affects the abundance of retrotn- and hp-derived esirnas by modulating cellular localization and concentration of dcr <dig> substrates .

bioinformatic analyses of retrotn- and hp-derived esirnas reveals physical distinctions between these groups . additionally, retrotn precursors and their corrosponding esirnas are highly enriched in the nucleus while hp dsrnas and their corresponding esirnas are cytoplasmic similar to mrnas . we hypothesize that these observed disparities are directly related to distinct differences in secondary structures  and compartmentalization of esirna biogenesis factors required to process each structure. dsrnas derived from s and as transcription of retrotns  <cit>  generally result in fully complementary, blunt-ended dsrnas as many as retrotn transcripts are poorly polyadenylated  <cit> . the secondary structures of hps containing multiple inverted repeats are likely variable and complex with frayed ends . previous in vitro assays suggest that dcr <dig> alone can bind and processively cleave blunt dsrnas. however, dcr <dig> requires a co-factor, loqs-pd, to process dsrnas with frayed termini presumably because loqs-pd allows dcr <dig> to bind a substrate internally  <cit> ; loqs-pd is cytoplasmic in drosophila culture cells  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest a model in which nuclear retained blunt-ended, fully complementary retrotn precursors can be processed in the nucleus by dcr <dig> alone while more complicated hp precursors requiring loqs-pd are cleaved in the cytoplasm by dcr <dig> . this model is supported by our observations that esirnas map the entire length of retrotns . additionally, previous work shows that r2d <dig> and dcr <dig> aggregate in cytoplasmic d <dig> bodies together with hps  <cit> .

this model predicts that depletion of loqs-pd would only affect cleavage of hps precursors and the levels of hp-derived esirnas, but not esirnas generated from retrotns. zhou et al. previously reported that depletion of loqs isoforms reduced the number of esirnas derived from both hps and tns  <cit> ; however, close examination of the data reveal that retrotn-mapping esirnas were unaffected by loqs knockdown. the most notably affected tn, proto-p, is not regulated by the esirna pathway  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data support a novel model in which esirnas are differentially processed from retrotn and hp precursors; retrotn precursors are processed by dcr <dig> in the nucleus, while biogenesis of esirnas from hp precursors occurs in the cytoplasm. additionally, dcr <dig> clearly interacts with the ccc in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm. the ccc indirectly affects esirnas biogenesis by regulating dcr <dig> substrate levels and directing cellular localization of retrotn and hp rnas. these data contribute significantly to our understanding of dcr <dig> dependent esirna production in drosophila culture cells, but questions regarding dcr2-ccc complex assembly and function remain. future studies investigating the role of the dcr2-ccc complex in both mrna 3’ end processing and retrotn dsrna processing will further elucidate molecular details of how these proteins function in drosophila culture cells.
