BACKGROUND
streptococcus iniae  is a hemolytic gram-positive coccus that is a major pathogen of culture fish. it has been associated with disease outbreak in several species of freshwater and marine fish cultured worldwide, including tilapia  <cit> , barramundi  <cit> , channel catfish  <cit> , hybrid striped bass  <cit> , japanese flounder  <cit> , olive flounder  <cit> , rabbitfish  <cit> , and rainbow trout  <cit> . streptococcal infection can lead to serious symptoms such as meningoencephalitis and generalized septicaemia with high mortality rates of up to 50%  <cit> . s. iniae is also known to be an opportunistic pathogen that can cause fulminant soft tissue infection in humans, such as bacteremic cellulitis, septicarthritis, and endocarditis  <cit> . identifying potential virulence determinants of streptococcal infection will eventually help to the control and eradication of the disease.

iron plays a significant role in many biological processes and is vital for several metabolic processes. moreover, many proteins such as cytochromes and tricarboxylic acid metalloenzymes use iron as a cofactor  <cit> . iron is also required for important cellular functions such as the transport and storage of oxygen and as a catalyst in electron transport processes  <cit> . the levels of several virulence determinants produced by bacterial pathogens, such as toxins and hemolysins, are depressed under iron-restricted conditions  <cit> . despite its abundance in the natural environment, iron has low solubility under physiological conditions. moreover, it may be associated with heme or hemo-proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin, haptoglobin, hemoglobin, and ferritin and such forms do not readily support the growth of microorganisms. many microorganisms circumvent this nutritional limitation by forming direct contacts with iron-containing proteins through atp-binding cassette  transporters.

the abc transporter superfamilies constitute many different systems that are widespread among living organisms and show different functions, such as ligands translocation, mrna translation, and dna repair. the general principle of abc transport systems involves the ligands translocation through a pore formed by two integral membrane protein domains. this is accompanied by atp hydrolysis through two nucleotide-binding domains associated with the cytoplasmic side of the pore. in bacteria, ligand translocation is preceded by interaction with an accessory component, i.e., the periplasmic-binding protein  <cit> .

in this study, an abc transporter member, named as mtsabc  was cloned from s. iniae hd- <dig> which is cotranscribed by three genes and was shown to share amino acid sequence homology with the metal abc transport proteins of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. blast-mediated sequences similarity searches of the derived amino acid sequences of the mtsabc operon indicated that mtsa encodes a metal solute-binding lipoprotein, mtsb encodes an atp-binding protein , and mtsc encodes a transmembrane permease protein. our data showed that mtsa is a lipoprotein, and associated with heme. moreover, this protein is expressed in vivo during kunming mice infection by s. iniae hd- <dig>  these results provide information on the role of mtsa in heme utilization and the possibility of using mtsa as an effective s. iniae vaccine candidate.

RESULTS
cloning and reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis of mtsabc
to clone mtsabc from s. iniae hd- <dig>  primers designed based on the conserved regions of the published amino acid sequence of metal abc transporter were used. the pcr products from genomic dna template were subsequently sequenced by invitrogen corporation. the results showed that the orfs of mtsa , mtsb , mtsc , mtsab, and mtsbc had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp respectively. reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis confirmed that the mtsa gene is the first of three contiguous orfs that are preceded by a potential promoter region. these three genes are transcribed in the same direction and have very short intergenic sequences, with transcription terminating between mtsa and mtsb, suggesting that these genes constitute a single transcriptional unit . no corresponding pcr products were obtained with the same mrna sample as the template, indicating that the rna sample was not contaminated with dna.

sequence analysis of mtsabc
abc systems are widespread among living organisms and have been detected in all genera of the three kingdoms of life. these systems show remarkable conservation in the primary sequence of the cassette and in the organization of constitutive domains or subunits  <cit> . all abc systems share a highly conserved atp-hydrolyzing domain  that is unequivocally characterized by three short sequence motifs, i.e., walker a, walker b, and a signature motif that is unique to abc proteins and is located upstream of the walker b motif  <cit> . blast of the derived amino acid sequences of the mtsabc operon indicated that mtsa encodes a metal solute-binding lipoprotein , mtsb encodes an atp-binding protein , and mtsc encodes a transmembrane permease protein . the closest homologs for these proteins are putative metal abc transporter proteins encoded by the mtu locus of streptococcus uberis 0140j and the mts locus of streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus mgcs <dig> . mtsa contains a helical backbone metal receptor  that functions in the abc transport of ferric siderophores and metal ions such as fe3+, mn2+, cu2+, and/or zn2+ . mtsb contains walker site a, walker site b, a signature sequence, and the 4th motif as defined by linton & higgins  <cit> . mtsc contains eight transmembrane subunits  of the periplasmic-binding protein -dependent abc transporters that are possibly involved in the uptake of siderophores, heme, vitamin b <dig>  or divalent cations . based on these observations, we concluded that mtsabc is a member of the abc transporter systems.

three patterns of signal peptide  were used to identify bacterial lipoproteins from bioinformatics data  <cit> . to characterize the mtsa protein, the scanprosite analysis was performed. the results indicated that the sequence of mtsa showed similarity to the following  <dig> patterns: residues d <dig> to d <dig>  hit the g+lppv <dig> pattern, and residues d <dig> to d <dig>  hit the ps <dig> pattern   <cit> , which suggested that mtsa is a lipoprotein. mtsa contains an lipoprotein peptidase cleavage site signal sequence as defined by linton & higgins  <cit> . to confirm that mtsa is a lipoprotein, the crude cell lysate of s. iniae hd- <dig> was mixed with triton x- <dig>  and the detergent phase was analyzed by western blotting using rabbit anti-mtsa antibodies . the results showed that mtsa protein was extracted by triton x- <dig>  together, the results indicated that mtsa protein is a lipoprotein.

purification of recombinant mtsa
to be able to further characterize mtsa, we first expressed recombinant mtsa consisting of amino acid residues d <dig> to d <dig> that lacked the putative signal sequence. briefly, mtsa gene was cloned and the pcr product was isolated from the plasmid after a double digestion with restriction enzymes bamhi and xhoi, and ligated into the compatible site of pet-32a-c  vector to yield recombinant protein mtsa. the expressed mtsa had a molecular mass of  <dig> -kda  with a tag from trx·tag to ecor v of pet-32a-c , which has a molecular weight of  <dig> -kda. the expression level of mtsa peaked after induction with  <dig> mm iptg at 37°c for  <dig> h. the mtsa protein was purified from e. coli bl <dig>  under native condition n the soluble form and immunized the new zealand white rabbits. the results showed that the rabbit anti-mtsa antibody titers increased from essentially zero to 1: <dig>  after four rounds of immunization . the western blotting analysis was performed to show the specificity of immunized sera against purified mtsa .

subcellular localization of mtsa
to determine the subcellular localization of mtsa, the western blotting was performed with the cellular fractions of s. iniae hd- <dig> using rabbit anti-mtsa antibodies . mtsa was detected in the particulate fraction of the cells when the cellular fractions were prepared by centrifugation of the crude cell lysate . mtsa was found to be associated with the protoplast and cell wall extracts when the cellular fractions were prepared by protoplast formation. after separation of the protoplasts, mtsa was detected in the particulate fraction .

to detect surface exposure of mtsa, cells of s. iniae hd- <dig> cells were harvested, washed, centrifuged, and resuspended in pbs. the cells were subjected to proteinase k  treatment with gentle agitation at room temperature for  <dig> h, and the cells were collected. western blotting showed that peptide fragments in the cells can be detected after  <dig> h incubation with proteinase k. however, when the cell wall extracts and protoplasts were used in the experiment, it were completely hydrolyzed and no peptide fragments were detected . together, this result indicated that mtsa is not exposure on surface, but is on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane and is buried inside the cell wall.

mtsa had heme-binding activity
to examine whether heme is the chromophore associated with mtsa, the pyridine hemochrome assay was performed  <cit> . the uv-visible absorption spectrum of purified mtsa exhibited peaks at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm, which were identical to those obtained from purified katg, a well-known heme-containing protein with spectral peaks at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm. the molar ratio of associated heme to purified mtsa was  <dig>  , this value is consistent with the hypothesis that one protein molecule is associated with one heme molecule.

to determine whether iron is present and its amount in purified mtsa, the icp-aes analysis were performed. the results showed that fe was present  in purified mtsa; however, four other bivalent metallic elements ca, mg, zn and mn were not detected. the amount of iron present in purified mtsa  was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mg l- <dig>  in three independent purification experiments respectively.

in vivo production of mtsa during s. iniae hd- <dig> infection
to determine whether mtsa is produced in vivo during s. iniae infection, we infected kunming mice with s. iniae hd- <dig> and performed western blotting analysis with purified mtsa to determine the presence of anti-mtsa antibodies in infected sera . the results indicated that mtsa is produced in vivo during experimental s. iniae hd- <dig> infection.

discussion
heme is an important nutrient for several bacteria and can serves as a source of essential iron. the most abundant source of iron in the body is heme, so it is not surprising to find that pathogenic bacteria can use heme as an iron source  <cit> . the presence of the central iron atom in heme allows it to undergo reversible oxidative change and act as a virulence-regulated determinant  <cit> . it is necessary for bacterial pathogens to acquire sufficient iron from their surroundings, and scavenging heme from the environment requires much less effort than synthesizing it de novo  <cit> .

acquiring iron from the micro-environment is important for the growth of bacterial pathogens. pathogens often use low environmental iron levels as a signal to induce virulence genes  <cit> . many pathogenic bacteria secrete exotoxins, proteases, and siderophores to rapidly increase the local concentration of free heme  <cit> , and it is common for pathogens to directly acquire iron from host iron-binding proteins by using receptor-mediated transport systems specific for host-iron complexes  <cit> .

to define the role of mtsa in heme utilization, the binding activity and subcellular localization of purified mtsa were investigated. the coding sequence of mtsa was cloned into the expression vector pet-32a-c . the major induced protein in e. coli  migrated as a  <dig> -kda band in sds-page gels; this size is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of mtsa. the  <dig> -kda mtsa was purified by ni2+ affinity chromatography and reacted with anti-mtsa antibodies from infected mice to confirm the in vivo production of mtsa. the uv-visible absorbance spectrum of katg is a typical heme-containing protein, and the results of the pyridine hemochrome assay indicated that mtsa is associated with heme. moreover, measurements of the iron level by icp-aes indicated that purified mtsa is a holo-protein that is associated with iron.

in general, there are four major types of cell surface display proteins in gram-positive bacteria, which are as follows: proteins anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by hydrophobic transmembrane domains; lipoproteins that are covalently attached to membrane lipids after cleavage by signal peptides ii; proteins that contain the c-terminal lpxtg-like motif and are covalently attached to peptidoglycan by sortase; and proteins that recognize some cell wall components by specific domains  <cit> . abc transporters are integral membrane proteins that transport diverse substrates across lipid bilayers  <cit> . in bacteria, abc transporters catalyze the uptake of essential nutrients or the extrusion of toxic substances  <cit> . abc importers, present only in prokaryotes, require a binding protein that delivers the captured substrate to the external face of the transporter  <cit> . as mtsa is a solute-binding protein of the abc transporter, its major function is presumed to be the capture and transfer of iron compounds to the downstream gene of the iron transport system of s. iniae hd- <dig>  the signal peptide pattern analysis and triton x- <dig> extraction results confirmed that mtsa is a lipoprotein. this result is reliable because the original g+lpp pattern was present in the analysis of the signal peptide features of  <dig> experimentally verified lipoproteins. lipoproteins in gram-positive bacteria are cell envelope proteins anchored to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. lipid modification is achieved through covalent addition of a diacylglyceride to an indispensable cysteine residue in the lipoprotein signal peptide that provides a common anchoring mechanism for what is now recognized as an abundant and functionally diverse class of peripheral membrane proteins  <cit> . in gram-positive bacteria, substrate-binding proteins of abc transporters are typically lipoproteins  <cit> , and the western blotting results is consistent with the notion that mtsa is an abc transporter lipoprotein  <cit> .

the results of this study indicated that mtsabc is a member of the abc transporter family. mtsa protein is a solute-binding protein that can bind to heme and facilitate the latter's use as a substrate by the s. iniae. western blotting indicated that mtsa is produced in vivo during experimental s. iniae hd- <dig> infection, and mtsa may be a potentially useful s. iniae protein vaccine candidate. further studies are needed to clarify the role of mtsa in the utilization of other iron compounds and other important cations, and to establish its candidacy as a useful s. iniae vaccine component.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study presents mtsa as a novel solute-binding protein that can contribute to iron transport. this is the first abc transporter member to be identified from s. iniae. we have shown that mtsa is a lipoprotein which can bind to heme, and is expressed in vivo during kunming mice infection by s. iniae hd- <dig>  more importantly, this is the first report on the cloning of abc transporter lipoprotein from s. iniae genomic dna, and its immunogenicity is indicative of its possible use as an s. iniae subunit vaccine.
