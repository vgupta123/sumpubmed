BACKGROUND
physiological left ventricular hypertrophy  is a complex cardiac adaptive response to chronic exercise  <cit> , sometimes referred to as the "athletic heart"  <cit> . it is characterized by an increase in left ventricular  mass, wall thickness and chamber size, underpinned by profound molecular and biochemical changes, that allows the heart to efficiently provide an increased cardiac output during periods of exercise  <cit> . the physiological lvh state can typically be maintained for months or years without significant compromise of cardiac function. in contrast, pathological lvh occurring in response to chronic cardiac overload, imposed by diseases such as hypertension, is characterized by a progression to contractile dysfunction and heart failure and an increased long-term mortality  <cit> . other differences between physiological and pathological lvh include the occurrence of significant fibrosis and capillary rarefaction in the latter condition. due to the stark clinical contrast between physiological and pathological lv remodeling, it is of importance to delineate the precise molecular mechanisms that drive these divergent responses to stress.

some progress has been made in elucidating mechanisms of physiological hypertrophy through a number of genomic analyses and several reports implicate activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase /akt pathway as an important component  <cit> . more recent studies offer the possibility to examine gene expression patterns in this phenotype more consistently and broadly  <cit> . however, restrictions still exist, primarily due to an innate heterogeneity of signaling cascades and limitations of conventional statistical methods to address higher order relationships between genes. visualization and analysis of biological data as networks is a powerful explorative alternative with the capacity to accurately assess complex relationships and eliminate noise inherent to microarray experiments  <cit> . although such methods have already been successful in defining mirna signature in obesity and diabetes  <cit> , discovering novel cancer-associated genes  <cit> , and predicting the involvement of genes in core biological processes  <cit> , their use in cardiovascular biology has been limited  <cit> .

recent availability of comprehensive mouse cardiac hypertrophy microarray datasets, deposited in resources such as arrayexpress  <cit>  and gene expression omnibus  <cit> , makes it possible to investigate global molecular mechanisms of this phenotype. the inference of gene relevance networks by co-expression analysis is based on the hypothesis that genes encoding proteins participating in the same pathway or biological process may often be co-regulated under a large number of experimental conditions  <cit> . an important advantage of network analysis algorithms is their ability to exploit local structure between biologically related nodes, thus eliminating most of the inherent noise  <cit> . additionally, confidence in network inference through co-expression analysis may be increased by an integrative approach that utilizes multiple datasets across a variety of experimental conditions and microarray platforms  <cit> .

in this study, a computational approach has been undertaken that identifies key expression patterns of physiological lvh using integrative analysis of  <dig> million gene co-expressions across  <dig> relevant microarray conditions. we included transcriptome data from studies in mouse models of physiological lvh induced by swimming exercise, cardiac-specific activation of akt, and cardiac-specific activation of pi3k. this is the first study in cardiac hypertrophy at this scale and it may provide a basis for further understanding of both physiological and pathological lvh phenotypes.

RESULTS
generation of microarray co-expression networks
gene expression profiles in heart tissue were investigated under normal conditions, during physiological  stress, and in two gene-modified models of physiological lvh involving cardiac activation of the pi3k/akt pathway. to estimate the specificity of the hypertrophic gene signature, an additional dataset monitoring gene expression in healthy mouse organs was also used.

four mouse microarray datasets totaling  <dig> arrays were obtained from arrayexpress for further analysis . the akt dataset was generated using a tetracycline-regulated transgenic system with the capacity to conditionally switch a constitutively active form of the akt <dig> protein kinase on or off in the adult heart  <cit> . this dataset consisted of normal heart tissue , short-term , activated akt <dig> , and switched-off akt <dig> . the pi3k dataset consisted of wild type hearts  and hearts with expression of dominant-negative pi3k  or constitutively active pi3k   <cit> . the swimming dataset, containing  <dig> arrays, monitored expression in mouse hearts under normal conditions, swimming , and swimming followed by  <dig> week of rest  <cit> . finally, the normal dataset  monitored transcript expression in healthy mouse tissues including bladder, bone, spleen, stomach, and the heart  <cit> .

capi3k = constitutively active form of pi3k, dn = dominant-negative form of pi3k.

after pre-processing , pair wise gene expression similarities were measured using the pearson correlation coefficient . co-expression networks were "undirected" and, at pcc ≥  <dig> , obeyed a power law, suggesting a scale-free architecture dominated by a number of highly connected "hub genes" . the pcc threshold was set to  <dig>  on the basis of the following evidence:  gene correlation profiles with pcc over  <dig>  were demonstrated to be more biologically relevant  <cit>  and  similar studies of human gene co-expression landscape  <cit>  have employed comparable threshold criteria. additionally, below this cut-off all networks were excessively large , suggesting a presence of false-positive edges. however, a more stringent pcc threshold was avoided, as further filtering has been implemented by selecting gene pairs that were correlated across all three datasets. finally, the "data driven cut-off" approach  was not deemed appropriate as it is intended primarily for comparison of multiple networks derived from differential phenotypes.

at pcc ≥  <dig>  it was noted that an increase of this cut-off value removed weakly connected links from all networks while maintaining a constant number of genes . average betweenness centrality  of all networks increased with pcc values, suggesting that applying a threshold to each network removed peripheral nodes and edges, leaving critical hubs intact . additionally, increasing the pcc threshold resulted in fragmentation of networks into a large number of structured subgraphs, reflected in the number of connected components and clustering coefficients . overall, networks derived from hypertrophic tissues were highly structured , characterized by nodes with multiple connections , small network diameters  and relatively high clustering coefficients .

co-expression model of physiological cardiac hypertrophy
due to the large number of genes and co-expression links observed in this analysis, some observations could be due to experimental artifacts and thus of questionable biological relevance. the recurrence of a co-expression link in all three microarray datasets was considered to increase the reliability of the inference. at pcc =  <dig> , the akt and pi3k networks shared  <dig> genes and  <dig> interactions, the pi3k and swimming networks shared  <dig> genes and  <dig> interactions, and the akt and swimming networks shared  <dig> genes and  <dig> interactions. there were  <dig> genes and  <dig> interactions common to all three networks, which formed a consensus 'conserved' gene co-expression network . similarly to the akt, pi3k, and swimming networks, the conserved network was scale-free.

to evaluate the statistical significance of the conserved network, three randomized networks were generated. randomization was performed by shuffling edges of the akt, pi3k, and swimming networks 4×  times, while preserving the node degrees of the original networks  <cit>  this procedure was repeated  <dig> times . the simulation showed that on average, the three random networks shared  <dig> co-expressed genes  and that at most their intersection contained  <dig> genes . these results indicated that identification of  <dig> genes in the conserved network is statistically significant .

phenotype specificity of the conserved network was estimated by comparing it to gene co-expressions inferred from the normal mouse transcriptome   <cit> . it was hypothesized that the extent of conserved nodes and edges between two networks may correspond to molecular mechanisms shared by the lvh phenotype and cells under basal conditions. interestingly, it was determined that the conserved and normal networks shared only  <dig> genes and  <dig> co-expressions, confirming that the conserved network may reflect lvh-specific cardiac response.

to gauge the extent of validated molecular pathways in all co-expression networks, all genes were mapped to the kegg pathway database  <cit> . genes with annotations in kegg pathways were considered to be true positives and network precision  was estimated as the proportion of true positive genes to the overall number of genes in a network . at pcc =  <dig> , network precision for the akt, pi3k, swimming, and conserved networks approached 31%. interestingly, it was noted that while increasing pcc threshold had no apparent effect on specificity of individual microarray networks, specificity of the conserved network increased up to two-fold with pcc values , suggesting that gene pairs with high pccs in the conserved network are likely to be well-annotated molecular entities.

all genes in the conserved network were processed further by mcl clustering  . there were  <dig> clusters, of which six contained > <dig> genes. the largest cluster consisted of  <dig> genes . enrichment of each mcl cluster for go biological process  terms  identified processes such as 'trna aminoacylation for protein transport' , 'cell division' , and 'protein transport'  . at the gene level, the conserved network was representative of go-bp terms such as 'regulation of transcription' , 'transport' , and 'signal transduction' , as well as kegg pathways such as 'focal adhesion' , 'mapk signaling pathway' , and 'neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction'  .

the generation of a conserved network for physiological cardiac hypertrophy consisting of  <dig> genes  and  <dig> interactions , based on a series of relevant microarray experiments and computational processing of gene expression similarities, is thus a first step towards the discovery of the molecular underpinnings of this phenotype, its basic components and their structural and functional features.

identification of critical hubs in the conserved co-expression network
the topology of the conserved network was explored further to identify hub genes. betweenness centrality  and node degree  were measured for  <dig> genes . there were  <dig> genes  with high betweenness centrality , connected by  <dig> interactions . these  <dig> genes formed the "core" of the conserved network  mainly because changes in their expression and/or structure are likely to alter behavior and topology of the overall network. remarkably,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes had both high betweenness centrality and node degrees . these genes tended to localize at the center of the network, while the other  <dig> genes aligned along the periphery . the three genes with the greatest values for both topological parameters were nfs <dig> , shfm <dig> , and rnf <dig> . it is interesting to note that nfs <dig> is an aminotransferase  <cit>  with a cysteine desulfurase function  <cit>  implicated in freidrich's ataxia  <cit> , a complex disease often associated with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype  <cit> . furthermore, shfm <dig> is the gene most likely associated with split hand/split foot malformation  in region 7q <dig> -q <dig>   <cit> , a disease exhibiting congenital heart defect phenotypes  <cit> . finally, rnf <dig> is a trans-membrane ring-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma  <cit> , but also expressed in chicken embryo brain and heart  <cit> . it follows that most of the other  <dig> genes uncovered by using the above mentioned topological parameters might also be implicated in expression patterns with a phenotype associated with heart tissue.

to test the hypothesis that hub genes may be crucial to the overall structure of the discovered network, the  <dig> most connected genes were systematically removed from the network. to assess network integrity, average betweenness and characteristic path length  were measured. betweenness did not change drastically following systematic removal of the top connected nodes compared to random node removal . however, systematic removal of hubs increased characteristic path length to a threshold beyond which it rapidly collapsed due to splintering of the core network into small subnetworks. characteristic path length was unaffected by removal of random genes and the network remained intact .

it was then of interest to identify biological processes represented by the core network. of  <dig> core genes,  <dig> participated in 'dna-dependent regulation of transcription',  <dig> in 'transport', and  <dig> in 'transcription'. additionally, the  <dig> genes were mapped to kegg pathways such as 'oxidative phosphorylation' , 'mapk signaling pathway , and 'focal adhesion'  . evidently, not all genes can be associated with go or kegg classes.

the topology of the core network was further interrogated by mcl clustering . mcl partitioned the core network into  <dig> clusters. the largest cluster contained  <dig> genes. overall, there were  <dig> clusters with  <dig> or more genes, representing 70% of the core network . because each cluster may contain genes involved in a common molecular pathway, over-represented kegg pathways for each cluster were identified using the log-odds ratio . only the largest three clusters could be detected as enriched by kegg pathways, due to low counts. for example, clusters  <dig> was mostly representative of 'apoptosis' and 'valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation'  while cluster  <dig> was representative of 'proteasome' . .

the question arises whether the  <dig> genes of the core network are also evolutionarily conserved. these genes were compared against the complete genomes of  <dig> species stored in the cogent database , resulting in a network of  <dig> pairwise sequence similarities covering  <dig> unique homologues . there are  <dig> genes that match  <dig> species or more, while the frequency distribution of core gene homologues is a typical distribution for sequence similarities   <cit> . only  <dig> genes do not have a homologue apart from human or mouse , most of them encoding proteins of unknown function, except  <dig> which encodes the 'ep <dig> interacting inhibitor of differentiation 1' gene. the following numbers of core genes have detected a number of unique homologues, respectively as follows:  <dig> detect  <dig> in human,  <dig> detect  <dig> in mouse,  <dig> detect  <dig> in drosophila melanogaster,  <dig> detect  <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans,  <dig> detect  <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae s <dig>  just  <dig> detect  <dig> in escherichia coli and  <dig> detect  <dig> in helicobacter pylori j <dig> strain , strongly indicating that the majority of the detected genes are confined to the mammalian taxonomic range. the high numbers for the animal model species as well as mouse and human are derived from extensive paralogous families within this set. further investigation is necessary to understand the evolutionary history of the detected core network.

thus, the generation of a core network for physiological cardiac hypertrophy reduces the initial number of genes to just over a thousand and consequently allows the further study of a more compact dataset, based on topological feature detection. the discovery of both known and newly detected cases in terms of genes and gene sets, along with their functional and evolutionary properties represents a consolidation of information that can be obtained from multiple microarray experiments for this key phenotype.

discussion
physiological stimuli such as chronic exercise lead to compensatory growth and remodeling of the heart associated with preserved or improved cardiac function. recently, class ia phosphoinositide 3-kinase  and akt <dig> have emerged as important regulators of physiological adaptation  <cit>  but the broader signaling cascades associated with physiological lvh remain poorly understood. in this study we show that network analysis has the potential to infer genome-wide biological mechanisms related to physiological lvh phenotype. importantly, we report on the network topology and functional properties of the physiological lvh networks, the first such analysis in a mammalian cardiovascular system.

gene expression profiles were used to identify conserved gene co-expression patterns in pi3k, akt <dig>  and swimming models of physiological lvh and to obtain a global overview of biological functions involved in physiological cardiac remodeling. previous reports have explored gene co-expression networks derived from heterogeneous microarray platforms  <cit>  and confirm that observing a conserved gene co-expression suggests a biological relevance  <cit> . the consensus gene co-expression model, referred to as the conserved network, consisted of  <dig> genes and  <dig> links . it was confirmed to be scale-free, highly structured, and non-random, suggesting the presence of a small number of critical hub genes that may be biologically relevant. additionally, the conserved network had only a trivial intersection with the normal interactome , suggesting that our consensus model may present a reliable physiological lvh signature. topological features were consistent with the general behavior of biological networks  <cit>  and topologies detected in protein-protein interaction collections such as string  <cit> . at pcc≥ <dig> , 31% of all genes in the conserved network were identified in the kegg pathways database. this coverage increased exponentially with pcc threshold, approaching 80% at pcc =  <dig>  . these results are comparable to previous studies of co-expression networks  <cit>  and suggest that an increase in pcc stringency produces a marked positive effect on network precision.

due to a large number of co-expression links , it is possible that some of these links are artifacts or byproducts of systematic error. thus, evaluation of conserved co-expression links across three physiological lvh networks has a number of strengths compared to conventional statistical approaches. first, reproducible co-expressions are less likely to be false-positives and may reflect biologically relevant links, thus presenting a reliable interactome for further experimental validation  <cit> . for example, in a recent meta-analysis of > <dig> tissue samples of gastric cancer, this hypothesis helped to identify a functional link between prognostic marker pla2g2a and the ephb <dig> receptor  <cit> . second, network intersections account for putative platform- or experiment-dependent variability  between multiple microarray datasets  <cit> . third, due to the heterogeneous  nature of physiological lvh models, conserved co-expressions provide an overview of common regulatory mechanisms.

these assumptions were confirmed using automated pubmed queries, whereby each gene in the conserved network was searched in the context of 'hypertrophy', 'heart', or 'heart failure'. indeed,  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes in the conserved network had at least one abstract per search term while  <dig> of those have at least one hundred abstracts for all terms, suggesting that the conserved network provides an acceptable coverage of current molecular knowledge of cardiac biology .

the conserved network may be used to describe the regulatory mechanisms underpinning the cardiac remodeling response to physiological stress. 'oxidative phosphorylation' was noted as one of the most abundant kegg pathways . the most over-represented members of this pathway were genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase  . cox is localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria and is the last component of respiratory chain. to sustain respiration, this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and facilitates the aerobic production of atp by atpsynthase   <cit> . to maintain efficient cardiac contractility under increased energetic demand, the regulation of cox function must be preserved. in post-myocardial infarction this mechanism is disrupted by the generation of reactive oxygen species  such as superoxide, leading to a marked loss of cox activity  <cit> . these results are consistent with the well-established concept that suppression of mitochondrial energy metabolism can lead to depression of cardiac contractile function  <cit> .

the conserved network was useful in the delineation of the cardiac response to increased protein synthesis and energy deprivation through activation of autophagy. this is a highly conserved cellular pro-survival mechanism for bulk lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components that mobilizes energy resources in response to starvation or hypoxia  <cit> . autophagy also has a protein quality-control housekeeping function. the conserved network identified two key genes related to autophagic processes, atg <dig>  and becn <dig> . both of these genes were topologically central to the conserved network , implicating them in critical mediation of network information flow. recent studies in mice with temporally controlled cardiac-specific deficiency of atg <dig> demonstrated that atg <dig> was essential for normal physiological growth and function of the heart. however, atg5-deficient animals developed contractile dysfunction and heart failure accompanied by increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins. furthermore, atg5-deficient hearts showed disorganized sarcomere structure and mitochondrial misalignment and aggregation  <cit> . these abnormalities were suggested, at least in part, to be due to loss of the protein quality control function of autophagy. becn <dig> is part of a pi3k complex that plays an important role during the initiation of autophagosome formation  <cit> . interestingly, mice with heterozygous disruption of becn <dig>  exhibited reduced levels of autophagy during reperfusion but had decreased apoptosis and reduced infarct size compared to wild type mice  <cit> , suggesting that in this case autophagy was detrimental. however, becn <dig> is an important point of crosstalk with apoptotic pathways through its interaction with anti-apoptotic proteins such as bcl- <dig>  <cit> . disruption of becn <dig> could therefore have pro- or anti-survival effects  <cit> . of note, in the conserved network, becn <dig> localized to the same mcl cluster as bcl- <dig>  which is known to inhibit becn1-depended autophagy  <cit> . thus, in physiological lvh, autophagy compatible with cell survival, rather than cell death, may be regulated by coordinated changes in atg <dig>  becn <dig> and bcl- <dig>  indeed, autophagy- and proteolysis-related genes localized to the same cluster as genes involved in cell cycle regulation, providing further support for this hypothesis.

to explore if key regulatory mechanisms may be encoded by topologically significant nodes, the conserved network was studied using concepts of betweenness centrality and node degree. these approaches are known to detect essential hubs in interaction networks  <cit>  and previous studies have demonstrated that betweenness is a good indicator of biological essentiality  <cit> . interestingly, when the top  <dig> hub genes were systematically removed from the conserved network, average network betweenness remained mostly constant and high, while characteristic path length increased dramatically, to a threshold beyond which the network collapsed. this may suggest a presence of a large number of well-connected genes that preserve network information flow, possibly an indicator of maintained functional cardiac integrity during physiological remodeling. additionally, topologically-central genes  localized to kegg pathways including 'oxidative phosphorylation' , 'mapk signaling pathway' , and 'focal adhesion'  .

several genes associated with the mammalian target of rapamycin  pathway  were also identified. the mtor pathway controls changes in cell size following activation of the pi3k/akt system. akt phosphorylates the tsc <dig> gene product tuberin, and thereby reduces its ability to stimulate gtp hydrolysis on the ras-like g protein rheb, leading to increased protein synthesis via ribosome biogenesis - a key feature of cardiac hypertrophy - and cell growth  <cit> . recently, inhibition of the mtor pathway by rapamycin was demonstrated to alleviate load-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice, making it a potential therapeutic target  <cit> . indeed, tsc <dig> had a very large betweenness centrality value , confirming that it is one of the key constituents of the conserved network. core genes present in the 'mapk signaling pathway' included map4k <dig>  map3k <dig>  rap1a, mapkapk <dig>  cacng <dig>  and ppm1b. of these, ppm1b  had the greatest node degree  and betweenness centrality  values, supporting its biological importance. these findings are reinforced by demonstration of direct inhibition of map3k <dig> by ppm1b  <cit> , thus providing further evidence that map3k <dig> activity is reduced in physiological hypertrophy protecting the heart from interstitial fibrosis, severe myocardial dysfunction, and apoptosis  <cit> .

similarly, the core conserved network suggests that the genes involved in kegg 'calcium signaling pathway' may be involved in physiological lvh. there were  <dig> genes  allocated to 'calcium signaling pathway', of which ppp3ca  had the largest betweenness centrality value . ppp3ca has been shown to be a key regulator of cardiac hypertrophy through activation of the transcription factor nfat  which promotes the expression of pro-hypertrophic genes in concert with other transcription factors such as gata <dig> and mef <dig>  <cit> . it can also inhibit map3k <dig> signaling  <cit> . the conserved network also provides further evidence that calcineurin activity is highly regulated under physiological conditions by elucidation of the rcn <dig> gene, which is known to inhibit calcineurin signaling  <cit> .

the use of mcl in the core network  identified enriched clusters of genes participating in similar biological pathways. for example, cluster  <dig> was enriched for kegg pathway 'apoptosis' . birc <dig>  encodes a protein that inhibits apoptosis by binding to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors traf <dig> and traf <dig>  although previously not reported in the mammalian heart, birc <dig> was confirmed as a critical regulator of vascular integrity and endothelial cell survival in zebrafish  <cit> . null mutants for birc <dig> showed severe hemorrhage and vascular regression due to endothelial cell integrity defects and activation of caspase-8-dependent apoptosis program. coordinated regulation of angiogenesis is essential for preserved cardiac contractile function  <cit>  and our results provide further molecular evidence for angiogenic gene programs in physiological lvh that merits further exploration.

CONCLUSIONS
this report presents the first integrative analysis of genome-wide expression data and computational network inference in the context of physiological lvh. the identification of several mechanisms already known to be involved in physiological cardiac remodeling based on prior experimental studies provides confirmation to the validity of the approaches used in this study. in addition to supporting current molecular understanding of the cardiac physiological response to stress, this work characterizes topological and functional properties of  <dig> potential molecular targets involved in the systematic regulation of physiological lvh. additionally, we demonstrate for the first time the evolutionary complexity of the hypertrophic response. our study suggests that evaluation of higher order relationships between genes and their neighbors, rather than mere individual over- or under-expression, may facilitate a better understanding of function in physiological and pathological phenotypes. overall, the results offer new support for the utility of co-expression network modeling and the quality of public microarray data in the context of cardiac hypertrophy, facilitating further analysis of complex physiological and pathological phenotypes.
