BACKGROUND
in the postabsorptive state, the portal drained viscera  and the liver account for 20–25% of the whole-body energy expenditure  <cit> , even though these organs represent < 10% of body weight. the disproportional energy requirement of the gut is ascribed to the very rapid turnover of enterocytes and the continuous synthesis and degradation of mucous glycoproteins, which may serve to buffer amino-acid availability in the postabsorptive period  <cit> . a comprehensive view of the adaptive response of the intestine to maintain its integrity during food deprivation is, nevertheless, still lacking. clinically, such insight is highly relevant to better understand the mucosal atrophy that develops as an undesirable sequel of parenteral nutrition  <cit> . furthermore, not all functions of the gut may have been appreciated thus far. as an example, the long-term fasted gut was only recently shown to be capable of gluconeogenesis  <cit> . to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of short-term and prolonged food deprivation, we performed a microarray-based study of the effects of fasting in the mouse small intestine . although changes at the mrna level cannot, of course, be directly extrapolated to metabolic adaptations, we show that the expression of genes involved in metabolism and cell turnover changed in a highly significant, coordinated manner, with a remarkably discontinuous transition between short-term and prolonged fasting. most of the early responses to fasting were transient, peaking at  <dig> hours after food withdrawal, whereas the late response became more pronounced with the duration of fasting.

RESULTS
effects of fasting on intestinal structure
to study the effect of fasting on the small intestine,  <dig> week old male fvb mice were subjected to fasting for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h and analyzed by means of immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling . during the first  <dig> hours of fasting, mice lost ~12% of their body weight . thereafter, weight loss was steady at a rate of ~7% per day, so that mice had lost ~30% of their initial weight at  <dig> hours . in figure 2a the percentage of weight loss was used to give an insight into its cumulative reduction. since the time intervals between the measurements were not identical, it was important to define a common denominator to determine the rate of body weight loss. for this reason, the rate of weight loss in consecutive time intervals was expressed as percent of weight loss per day. gut wet weight declined more than body weight, having lost almost 50% of its initial weight after  <dig> hours of fasting. small-intestinal weight loss was highest during the first  <dig> hours of fasting , low between  <dig> and  <dig> hours , to increase again between  <dig> and  <dig> hours . protein content was only determined in fed and  <dig> h-fasted guts, declining approximately 20% in this period . changes in intestinal weight, therefore, reflect changes in intestinal protein content. despite the pronounced loss of tissue mass, the basic morphology of the intestine remained unaffected . in particular, the length of the villi did not change . using carbamoylphosphate synthetase  as a marker for enterocytes and α-smooth-muscle actin  for smooth muscle, we could show that these two structural components accounted for ~75% and ~20%, respectively, of the intestinal volume in both fed and  <dig> h-fasted mice . alcian-blue staining for goblet cells showed no change in number between the fed and  <dig> h fasted condition . these data demonstrate that fasting induces a proportional shrinkage of the components of the small intestine. the staining intensity of the dna-synthesis marker pcna increased 28%  during the first  <dig> h of fasting and decreased to just 8%  at  <dig> h , while the number of active caspase 3-positive cells  had increased ~45%  and ~30%  relative to the number before fasting. since pcna is both involved in dna synthesis and repair, and since dna synthesis is suppressed in the fasting intestine  <cit> , these findings suggest that dna repair mechanisms might be regulated.

data are shown as average ± sem. there are no significant differences between the experimental groups with regard to villus height, cps-, αsma- and pcna-positive volume fraction, and number of alcian-blue positive cells. body and organ weight, caspase 3-positive cells, and total protein content differed significantly . ^: for caspase 3- and alcian blue-positive cells, the numbers are given per mm <dig>  #: total protein content of the gut was available for fed and  <dig> h-fasted animals only.

global gene-expression profile in the small intestine
out of  <dig> transcripts, including expressed sequence tags and riken sequences, which met our boundary condition for significance ,  <dig>  were ≥  <dig> -fold up- or downregulated. of these,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were ≥  <dig> -fold changed after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours of fasting, respectively .  a change higher than 2-fold occurred in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes after each of the fasting time points, respectively. a dendrogram  generated by unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the arrays , with correlation used as the similarity measure and average linkage as clustering parameters, revealed that the successive time points separated into distinct branches. the apparent predominance of biological over technical variation is a benchmark of the quality of the microarray analysis. because the time points investigated represent different, successive phases of the fasting response, the set of transcripts that were uniquely up- or downregulated at each of the time points can be used as biological markers to follow the effects of interventions of the fasting regimen .

quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of selected transcripts
the quantitative nature of the microarray data was validated with qpcr, using 18s ribosomal rna as an internal reference. of the  <dig> genes studied,  <dig> were up- and  <dig> downregulated by fasting, responding with a  <dig> – <dig> -fold change in expression on the microarrays. irrespective of whether the transcripts were rare  or abundant , their changes in expression were similar in the microarray and qpcr quantifications . the increase in gs and pepck expression was of interest, since the number of enterocytes expressing these enzymes increased concomitantly . the main difference between the time points is much more intense staining at the cytoplasm of the enterocytes, while the nuclei remained unstained.

global analysis reveals a transient early and gradual late intestinal response to fasting
cluster analysis did not reveal biologically meaningful groups of genes. in this respect, genmapp and, in particular, metacore™ were more informative tools to search for coordinate changes in metabolic pathways. the biochemical and signaling pathways in the small intestine that were affected by fasting were identified using p <  <dig>  and ≥  <dig> -fold change as thresholds for individual genes. figure  <dig>  based on the metacore™ approach, reveals that pathways involved in amino-acid, energy, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism, apoptosis, and cell-cycle control responded with a significant change in expression upon fasting. the graph in figure  <dig> presents p-values as parameter of the likelihood that coordinate changes in the pathways shown were indeed present at the different time points of fasting. as statistical parameter, the p-value encompasses no variation. the changes in amino-acid metabolism, cell-cycle and apoptosis were remarkably biphasic, with a transient early response that peaked at  <dig> hours after food withdrawal and a late response that became more pronounced with the duration of fasting. since all animals were sacrificed at the same time point during the day, the early, transient effects of fasting cannot be ascribed to a circadian rhythm. the figure further reveals that the changes in energy and carbohydrate metabolism became more pronounced with continued fasting, whereas lipid catabolism was no longer regulated at  <dig> hours. the common denominator of the transient early response appeared to be amino-acid metabolism and cell turnover , whereas the late response was associated with energy metabolism  and cell turnover. however, this global analysis does not reveal the direction of the changes and lacks functional detail. in the next sections, we therefore scrutinize some of the individual pathways to deduce the putative functional consequences.

fatty-acid catabolism
the expression of the transcription factor pparα, a major regulator of fatty-acid oxidation, was upregulated at  <dig> hours and even more so at  <dig> hours of fasting. the genes that are involved in the first stage of very long-chain fatty-acid oxidation  and the α-subunit of the trifunctional protein ) were upregulated at  <dig> hours of fasting, but this increase changed to down-regulation at  <dig> hours .  the expression of hmgcoa synthase <dig> was stimulated throughout the fasting period , facilitating the synthesis of ketone bodies from acetyl-coa. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase , the rate-determining enzyme of sterol biosynthesis, was downregulated  <dig> -2-fold at all three time points . finally, genes involved in glycerol metabolism , mitochondrial glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase  <dig>  and triosephosphate isomerase ) became downregulated during prolonged fasting, whereas the fatty-acid transporter cd <dig> became upregulated . these data underscore that lipid catabolism subserves energy metabolism in the small intestine during the first day of fasting only.

amino-acid and carbohydrate-backbone metabolism
of all pathways studied in the fasting gut, the adaptive changes in amino-acid metabolism were most pronounced, showing a predominant but transient response on the first day of fasting and another, less pronounced response during the later phase . to generate an overall view of these adaptive changes, we created a cumulative map of amino-acid metabolizing pathways within the genmapp environment .

early changes
most of the early changes in amino-acid metabolism converge on glutamine and glutamate. the  <dig> -fold increased concentration of asparagine synthetase  mrna is indicative for a deficiency in cellular amino acids, in particular glutamine  <cit> . the downregulation of cytosolic glutamate-consuming γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase  and the upregulation of glutamine synthetase can therefore be interpreted as an effort to preserve the cytosolic glutamine levels. the strong reduction in expression of mitochondrial glutaminase  points to preservation of mitochondrial glutamine and reduction of ammonia production. similarly, the strongly decreased expression of mitochondrial ornithine transaminase , which, in enterocytes, transaminates glutamate to ornithine  <cit> , and the increased expression of mitochondrial proline oxidase  both have a sparing effect on mitochondrial glutamate. furthermore, the 2-fold downregulation of mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase , in conjunction with the enhanced nadh production during fatty acid oxidation, suggests that mitochondrial glutamate does not feed the citric-acid cycle via deamination. finally, mitochondrial branched-chain amino-acid transaminase  was downregulated.

the citric-acid cycle becomes supplied with acetyl-coa from fatty-acid oxidation rather than from pyruvate, as the  <dig> -fold upregulation of pdk <dig> expression almost certainly inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase. although expression of pyruvate carboxylase  was not changed, its activity is enhanced by acetyl-coa. the upregulation of α-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase  and succinate dehydrogenase  further suggests that mitochondrial atp synthesis is initially spared. the combination of the downregulation of enzymes consuming mitochondrial glutamate  and the upregulation of mitochondrial glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase  suggests enhanced cycling through a truncated portion of the citric-acid cycle  <cit> . the very pronounced upregulation of pepck expression points towards a stimulation of the consumption of oxaloacetate for pep synthesis and, since glucose-6-phosphatase is not upregulated, lactate production. in aggregate, the data point to changes favoring the conservation of glutamine, an inhibition of pyruvate oxidation, a preserved capacity for oxaloacetate synthesis, and an enhanced capacity for pep synthesis. the demand for oxaloacetate, in conjunction with the  <dig> -fold upregulation of hmgcs <dig>  indicates that acetyl-coa from fatty-acid oxidation also stimulates the synthesis of ketone bodies.

prolonged fasting
at  <dig> hours of fasting , mitochondrial glutaminase was still strongly inhibited, whereas gs expression was still very strongly upregulated. mitochondrial glutamate metabolism still appeared to be conserved for α-ketoglutarate production , but gldh expression was 2-fold stimulated and got <dig> expression had returned to fed values. because nadh production from fatty-acid oxidation was no longer stimulated, these changes indicate that glutamate now feeds the citric-acid cycle via deamination. pdk <dig> and hmgcs <dig> were still strongly upregulated, suggesting that pyruvate oxidation was still inhibited and ketone-body synthesis stimulated. pepck expression was still strongly upregulated. in addition, the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase  increased  <dig> -fold, whereas that of lactate dehydrogenase had decreased almost 3-fold, suggesting that the enterocytes had acquired the capacity to produce glucose rather than lactate from amino acids, in particular glutamate. several steps in bcaa and tryptophan metabolism were strongly downregulated, probably to conserve these essential amino acids.

the 2-fold downregulation of glucosamine 6-phosphate n-acetyltransferase across the entire fasting period, together with more than 2-fold upregulation of glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase at  <dig> hours, suggest an inhibition of udp-glcnac synthesis and a decline of o-glycosylation. an obvious target is mucus production.

alcohol-metabolizing enzymes  and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a <dig> , involved in the oxidation and elimination of metabolic alcohols and aldehydes, including products of lipid peroxidation  <cit> , were downregulated.

electron-transport chain
the genes of the electron-transport chain responded progressively to fasting. at  <dig> hours of fasting,  <dig> genes  were downregulated, whereas  <dig> genes, scattered over all  <dig> complexes, were upregulated . at  <dig> hours, only  <dig> genes remained upregulated among  <dig> downregulated species. at  <dig> hours of fasting, no fewer than 62% of the respiratory chain genes, including cytochrome c, were downregulated . taken together, these data indicate that the capacity for atp synthesis becomes strongly suppressed in the empty gut.

cell cycle and apoptosis in response to nutrient deprivation
the finding that pcna protein as visualized with immunostaining, was more prominently present at  <dig> h of fasting , demonstrates that the observed changes in mrna levels  reveal activity of signaling routes, which become reflected in protein levels with a delay. among other genes involved in dna repair, the critical serine-threonine kinase atm, which regulates the checkpoint signaling due to the double-strand breaks, was upregulated . the 'executive' genes, however, like dna polymeraseβ, nibrin, or double strand-break repair-protein mre <dig>  were all downregulated at one or more time points . it is therefore difficult to draw a straightforward conclusion on the overall effect of fasting on dna repair.

in addition to the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, the expression of genes involved in apoptosis was suppressed. we modified the apoptosis map in the genmapp environment to visualize this adaptive response . the caspase-cascade elements casp <dig> and  <dig>  and cytochrome c became downregulated early during fasting, the effect being most pronounced at  <dig> days of fasting. the expression of the apoptosis antagonist bcl <dig> and bcl2l , which prevent the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and the pro-survival akt became strongly upregulated at  <dig> hours, whereas the bcl-associated death promoter , apoptotic protease-activating factor  <dig> , and caspases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were strongly down-regulated. the notion that cell turnover is suppressed is underscored by the relatively mild increase in number of active caspase 3-positive cells  after  <dig> days of fasting.

autophagy is another well-known adaptive response to nutrient starvation  <cit> . we did not notice a major change in genes involved in autophagy, but only few were represented on the arrays.

discussion
phases in the adaptive response to fasting
based on the rate of weight loss after food withdrawal, the body passes through  <dig> successive adaptive phases . during the first, postabsorptive fasting phase, the rate of weight loss is relatively high  and ~10% per day in rats  <cit> ). during the intermediate, "coping" phase, the loss of body mass is slower . during the last, preterminal fasting phase, the loss of body weight again increases . we did not observe a preterminal phase with an increased rate of body-weight loss in our mice. at  <dig> h, our mice still looked vital. one explanation could therefore be that they had not yet or had just entered the preterminal phase of body-weight loss. alternatively, mice, unlike rats, do not have the preterminal phase characterized by an increased weight loss. the initial phase of fasting is accompanied, at the whole body level, by a decline in circulating insulin, glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol levels  <cit> , a reduction in protein synthesis and an increase in protein degradation, while the intermediate, coping phase shows a temporary increase in circulating ketone bodies  <cit>  and free fatty acids  <cit> , and a decline in protein degradation  <cit> . the final, preterminal phase of fasting is accompanied by an increase in circulating corticosterone and plasma urea levels and a further decline in whole-body protein synthesis  <cit> . from these data, it was concluded that mammals adapt to prolonged fasting by mobilizing fat stores and minimizing protein loss. this model was then implicitly expanded to all organs separately, including the gut.

however, microarray studies that have prospected the adaptive response to fasting of the small intestine , liver  <cit> , and muscle  <cit> , and more limited studies in kidney  <cit> , reveal a different scenario. liver, muscle, and kidney respond to fasting with a progressive change over time in mrna concentrations of enzymes involved in protein, carbohydrate and fat metabolism. the small intestine differs from these organs in its biphasic response to fasting, that is, the small intestine mounts, in addition to the slow, progressive changes in expression that are also seen in liver, muscle, and kidney, a pronounced, but transient early response. in this early phase of fasting, gene expression changes in a direction that facilitates the preservation of glutamine, the catabolism of glutamate to atp and lactate, and the suppression of excessive cell turnover. the progressive late response is numerically characterized by a larger number of affected genes , higher fold changes in expression , and functionally by changes in gene expression that favor, in addition to suppression of cell turnover, glucose rather than lactate production.

adaptive changes in intestinal morphology and cell turnover
our data show that weight loss in response to fasting is more pronounced in the small intestine than in the body at large. the relative loss of intestinal wet weight upon fasting is similar in mice  and rats  <cit> . mice differ from rats in that villar height, crypt depth, and cell number per villus or crypt are not , or hardly  <cit>  affected by fasting, whereas in fasting rats crypt and villar length decline to ~60%  <cit> . apart from villar density, no changes in the relative volume of the mucosa , of goblet cells , and smooth muscle  develop in fasting mice . the important consequence of these findings is that fasting induces a proportional shrinkage of all components of the small intestine in mice, that is, the contribution of different cell types remains unchanged. the tissue base for the microarray data does, therefore, not change in the course of the experiment.

mechanisms that may account for the preservation of intestinal architecture are the suppression of the normally high cellular turnover, that is, cell multiplication  <cit>  and apoptosis  <cit> . in both rats  <cit>  and mice , starvation is accompanied by an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the epithelium, but in view of the simultaneously occurring proportional reduction of all structural components, the susceptibility to undergo apoptosis must be decreased in the surviving cells  <cit> . accordingly, the microarray data reveal a regulation of the bcl <dig> gene family. in agreement with their longer survival, the enterocytes of fasting intestines look more mature that those in the fed intestine  <cit> . the spreading of the expression of pepck and gs across the entire villus is also compatible with a more differentiated phenotype of the enterocytes. the microarrays also indicate a downregulation of cell-cycle genes. this is in apparent contrast to the elevated pcna staining. most studies show inhibition of cell proliferation during fasting  <cit> , but an increased dna synthesis in the rat intestine has been reported upon prolonged fasting  <cit> . we interpret these observations as indicating that dna repair rather than cell proliferation is stimulated to maintain epithelial integrity.

adaptive changes in intestinal metabolism – early adjustments
the metacore analysis revealed that the adaptive changes in intestinal metabolism converge, as could perhaps be expected, on energy metabolism . the upregulation of asparagine synthetase was an informative starting point, as it revealed that intracellular glutamine levels were limiting  <cit> . since the landmark experiments of windmueller and spaeth 25– <dig> years ago  <cit> , it is known that the small intestine of rodents is an avid consumer of glutamine in addition to glucose for its energy supply. in agreement, the observed changes in mrna levels of amino-acid metabolizing enzymes were concentrated in the glutamate family of amino acids . short-term fasting is typically associated with an increased concentration of free fatty acids in the circulation  <cit> . intracellular oxidation of fatty acids causes an increase in the intramitochondrial acetylcoa/coa and nadh/nad+ ratios and an inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase  <cit> . in agreement, our data pointed to a strong inhibition of pyruvate oxidation, as well as an enhanced synthesis of ketone bodies during fatty-acid oxidation . the data also suggested an enhanced cycling in a truncated citric-acid cycle from glutamate via α-ketoglutarate and succinate to oxaloacetate and back to glutamate. this truncated citric-acid cycle appeared to be fed by glutamate, because mitochondrial enzymes catabolizing glutamate were downregulated. in addition to glutamate, a number of amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids could feed this minicycle and yield atp. the high intramitochondrial nadh/nad+ ratio, which facilitates malate formation from oxaloacetate and export to the cytosol, together with the very strong upregulation of pepck, suggested enhanced pep synthesis. in view of the very low g6pase expression, pep is probably converted to pyruvate, again yielding an atp, and then lactate as substrate for gluconeogenesis in the liver  <cit> . it is well possible that bcaa catabolism is inhibited to avoid excessive drainage of these essential amino acids.

the role of ppara in the early response to fasting
the prominent role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α  in the adaptive response to fasting is well documented  <cit> . in agreement, we observed that pparα itself and a number of pparα-dependent genes involved in fatty-acid β-oxidation  and ketone-body synthesis  were induced in the intestine upon fasting. ketone-body production is a well-known response to fasting in the liver  <cit> , but not in the adult intestine. however, the suckling intestine does produce ketone bodies until weaning  <cit> . our data indicate that the capacity to produce ketone bodies is reactivated upon short-term fasting. production of ketone bodies in the gut may contribute to the increased ketonemia in prolonged fasting  <cit> .

in addition to genes involved in fatty-acid oxidation, many other pparα-target genes shown in supplementary table  <dig>  exhibited the early, transient induction pattern. furthermore, pparα regulates the expression of caspase  <dig> and amino-acid metabolizing enzymes, also in the gut  <cit> . in aggregate, our findings therefore extend the earlier finding that pparα functions as a dominant regulatory factor in the response to fasting of the gut.

the late response to fasting
among the major changes that characterize the late response to fasting are the downregulation of fatty-acid oxidation, the severe downregulation of genes involved in the respiratory chain, and the upregulation of glucose synthesis . whether or not the fasting gut produces glucose has attracted much interest lately  <cit> . we did observe that the expression of pepck and g6pase mrna is increased, while that of ldh <dig> is strongly downregulated. metabolic studies indicate that the small intestine may account for 30–35% of total body gluconeogenesis after prolonged fasting  <cit> . although we studied only changes in mrna levels, we did also observe that glycogen, which completely disappears from murine liver within  <dig> hours of fasting, accumulates to a high level in the pericentral zone of the liver lobule after  <dig> hours of fasting . the source of pericentral glycogen is blood glucose  <cit> , whereas amino acids and lactate typically generate periportal glycogen  <cit> . however, the generation of atp necessary for gut gluconeogenesis must become increasingly precarious, because the respiratory chain becomes progressively inhibited .

limitations of the study
it goes without saying that our interpretations have their caveats if extrapolated to larger mammals. the mouse, as a very small animal, survives at most  <dig> days without food  <cit> , whereas rats survive more than  <dig> weeks  <cit>  and humans  <dig> months  <cit> . the degree to which intestinal mucosa is affected by fasting appears to vary between species. rat and pig have been reported to lose up to  <dig> and  <dig> % of intestinal weight as a result of fasting, respectively  <cit> . the villar height decreases up to 50% in fasted rats and 30% in fasted piglets. only a modest mucosal atrophy  was found in critically ill humans  <cit> . our findings on preserved gut morphology in the mouse, therefore, resemble the situation in humans.

another obvious caveat of the present study is that only adaptive changes in cellular mrna concentration were analyzed and used to construct the adaptive metabolic response. most adaptive changes occur more rapidly at the mrna than at the protein level. furthermore, not all changes at the mrna level perspire to changes at the protein level, whereas more than  <dig> known posttranslational modifications  <cit>  do not need changes in mrna level to affect the activity of proteins. the changes at the mrna level that we report do probably reflect changes in the signal-transduction network that mediates the adaptive changes in metabolism and cell turnover better than that they reflect the changes in protein levels. the changes in signal transduction that modulate metabolite flow, the cell cycle and apoptosis are presently being analyzed.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that the adaptive changes in gene expression in the murine small intestine that are induced by fasting are directed at the induction of a proportional shrinkage of the tissue components of the small intestine. the preservation of the overall architecture of the organ is achieved by converting proteins and fats into energy substrates, while suppressing excess cell turnover. the response to fasting is biphasic, with an early, postabsorptive response that peaks at  <dig> hours and a late response that becomes more pronounced with continued fasting. the two phases differ in that gene expression during the early adaptive phase changes in a direction that facilitated the preservation of glutamine, the catabolism of glutamate to lactate, and the catabolism of fats to ketone bodies. prolonged fasting appeared to induce the production of glucose rather than lactate from carbohydrate backbones, a downregulation of fatty-acid oxidation and a very strong downregulation of the electron-transport chain.
