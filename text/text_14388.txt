BACKGROUND
iron  is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and production. this is due to the fact that it is an essential co-factor in a variety of enzymes that play critical roles in photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen fixation  <cit> . although fe is the second most abundant metal element in the earth crust, its bio-availability is limited, especially in alkaline soils where fe largely exists as insoluble hydroxides or oxides  <cit> . while the optimal fe concentration for plant growth is in the range of 10- <dig> to 10-4m , the bio-available fe in most soils is approximately 10- <dig> m  <cit> . plants have two distinct uptake strategies to increase the efficiency of fe uptake from soil  <cit> . the reduction strategy employed by non-grass plant species uses a fe deficiency induced reductase to convert insoluble fe to fe, the latter being transported into plant cells by the fe transporter irt <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, grass species use a chelating strategy to obtain fe from soil. the chelating strategy consists of fe deficiency induced biosynthesis and secretion of phytosiderophore and cognate high affinity transporters, fe-phytosiderophore yellow stripe transporter, zmys <dig>  hvys <dig> and osysl <dig>  <cit> .

many of the components involved in fe uptake for both of the strategies outlined above have been identified at a molecular level. in arabidopsis h+-atpase  <dig>  that mediates acidification of the rhizosphere  <cit> , a ferric reductase fro <dig>  <cit>  and a ferrous fe transporter irt <dig>  <cit> , represent the three key components required for a strategy i fe uptake system. identification of the molecular components involved in strategy ii fe uptake system has focused on the biosynthesis of the fe-chelator, phytosiderophore   <cit> . key genes in the ps biosynthesis include nicotianamine synthase gene osnas1/2/ <dig>  <cit> , nicotianamine aminotransferase gene osnaat <dig>  <cit> , and the cognate transporter yellow-stripe  <dig>  <cit> .

many of the genes involved in fe uptake via strategy i or ii display a distinct fe deficiency induced expression pattern  <cit> . transcriptome studies have shown that large scale alterations of transcript abundances is a common feature of fe deficiency and thus plays a key role in the fe deficiency response  <cit> . alterations in transcript abundances of genes encoding transcription factors are of particular interest in these studies due to their potential role in regulating the fe deficiency response. the bhlh transcription factor fer, a regulator of iron uptake, was first identified from the analysis of the tomato fer mutant  <cit> . the fer mutant failed to activate a strategy i fe uptake pathway under fe deficient conditions. studies have also shown that either fer or its arabidopsis ortholog, fer-like transcription factor, fit <dig>  is required for the strategy i responses  <cit> . subsequent studies have identified a family of bhlh transcription factors in arabidopsis  that interact with fit <dig>  <cit> . a number of transcription factors involved in regulating the fe deficiency response in oryza sativa  have also been identified. the fe-regulated bhlh transcription factor, osiro <dig>  shares high similarity with the arabidopsis family of bhlh transcription factors and positively regulates the expression of strategy ii pathway genes, including osnas1/2/ <dig>  osnaat <dig>  deoxymugineic acid synthase gene osdmas <dig> and a ys-like gene osysl <dig>  <cit> . two other transcription factors, fe-deficiency-responsive factors, idef <dig> and idef <dig>  bind the fe-deficiency-responsive elements  <dig> and  <dig>  and positively regulate a large number of fe responsive genes  <cit> . as idef <dig> and idef <dig> are constitutively expressed in roots and shoots in rice, other regulatory factors which may only be expressed under fe limiting conditions may be involved in regulating the response to fe deficiency.

a previous study identified transcripts of several genes encoding transcription factors that changed in abundance with fe deficiency  <cit> . in this study, the function of one of the transcription factors, a bhlh transcription factor  family protein, named osiro <dig>  was investigated. our analysis suggests that osiro <dig> acts as a negative regulator of the fe deficiency response.

RESULTS
osiro <dig> is specifically induced by fe deficiency
previous studies in our laboratory identified several transcription factors whose expression was induced by fe deficiency in rice  <cit> . one gene encoding a bhlh transcription factor, osiro <dig>  is highly induced by fe deficiency in both roots and shoots  <cit> . to determine whether the induction of osiro <dig> is specific to fe deficiency or whether this induction could be observed under deficiency of other minerals, the transcript abundance of osiro <dig> was determined from plants grown under a variety of different mineral element deficient conditions. the transcript abundance of osiro <dig> was markedly induced by fe deficiency in both roots and shoots, by 25- and 90-fold respectively . deficiency of several other minerals, including copper and zinc had no effect of the induction of osiro <dig> in roots or shoots , indicating that the induction of osiro <dig> was specific to fe deficient conditions.

the time-course expression pattern of the osiro <dig> and the other two known transcription factors, osiro <dig> and idef <dig>  in response to fe deficiency was investigated. consistent with previous studies  <cit> , idef <dig> was constitutively expressed in both roots and shoots . in contrast osiro <dig> and osiro <dig> were significantly up-regulated by fe deficiency, with a 10-fold induction or greater evident after  <dig> days and continued induction up to  <dig> days . the induction of osiro <dig> was less in terms of magnitude in shoots, osiro <dig> was induced 20-fold compared to osiro <dig> being induced almost 40-fold after  <dig> days . in roots osiro <dig> induction lagged behind that of osiro <dig> both in time and magnitude, osiro <dig> was already induced 50-fold after  <dig> day compared to osiro <dig> for which a 10-fold induction was observed only after  <dig> days .

subcellular localization of osiro3
to determine the subcellular localization of osiro <dig> protein, the full length cdna of osiro <dig> was cloned in frame to the 3' end of the sgfp. the expression of the fusion protein was driven by the 35s camv promoter. targeting ability was tested in onion epidermal cells using microprojectile bombardment along with the vector control which contains sgfp alone. results showed that the osiro3::sgfp fusion protein was targeted to nuclei . the control sgfp was found throughout the cell, in nuclei and the cytosol , indicating that osiro <dig> has specific nuclear targeting ability.

phylogenetic analysis of osiro3
there are  <dig> and  <dig> predicted members of the bhlh-domain containing transcription factors in arabidopsis and rice respectively  <cit> . to investigate the relationship between osiro <dig> and previously characterized bhlh transcription factors regulating the fe deficient response in arabidopsis and rice, a phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences of osiro <dig> and the previously characterized bhlh transcription factors tomato fer  <cit> , arabidopsis fit <dig>  <cit> , atbhlh  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  was performed . as expected, fer and its arabidopsis ortholog, fit <dig> were classified into the same clade . osiro <dig> branches in the same clade with the arabidopsis bhlh family proteins 38/39/100/ <dig> . osiro <dig> branches into clade iii . atbhlh <dig>  which was reported to modulate metal homeostasis and response to auxin was also found in this clade  <cit> . the protein sequence of arabidopsis ilr <dig> is only  <dig> % identical to osiro <dig>  also, osbhlh <dig> , that branches closest to osiro <dig> , has been previously reported to be induced by cold stress  <cit> .

over-expressing osiro <dig> results in hypersensitivity to fe deficiency
osiro <dig> was over-expressed  in rice to investigate the role it played in fe homeostasis. two independent oe transgenic lines with significantly altered expression level of osiro <dig>  were studied in detail. to examine if alteration of osiro <dig> expression in transgenic lines influences tolerance to low fe conditions, three week old oe and wild-type rice seedlings were transferred into solution culture containing high , moderate , or low  levels of fe for  <dig> days. under fe sufficient conditions , the transgenic seedlings overexpressing osiro <dig> had significantly shorter shoots compared to the wild-type counterparts, although the color was normal with no evidence of chlorosis that would suggest fe deficiency . spad values and fe concentrations from these plants also confirm values very close to wild type, although spad values were slightly but significantly lower . under moderate fe supply , the two oe lines displayed a chlorotic phenotype in the newly developed leaves compared to the wild-type plants . the spad values of the youngest leaves in both oe lines under  <dig> μm fe were reduced to ~ 65% compared to the wild-type control . at  <dig> μm fe supply, all plants displayed chlorotic symptoms . both oe lines had significantly reduced spad values and shoot height compared to wild-type . the fe concentration of shoots in both oe lines was significantly reduced compared to wild-type under both medium and low levels of fe supply .

osiro <dig> suppresses the induction of fe responsive genes by fe deficiency
the expression patterns of previously characterized fe deficiency responsive genes, osnas <dig>  osnas <dig>  osiro <dig>  osirt <dig>  osysl <dig>  and osnramp <dig>  <cit>  were investigated under different fe levels. as expected, all of these genes were markedly induced by fe deficiency . osnas <dig> and osnas <dig> were very sensitive to fe availability, displaying the highest induction levels under fe deficiency conditions . however, in the two oe osiro <dig> transgenic lines, the induction of transcript abundance for these genes, with the exception of osirt <dig> in roots, was significantly suppressed under all three fe supply conditions . the expression of osirt <dig> was only significantly down-regulated by both oe lines under low fe supply condition .

discussion
several lines of evidence indicate an important regulatory role for osiro <dig> in response to fe deficiency in rice. firstly, it is specifically induced by fe deficiency but not by other metal depletion. secondly, osiro3-oe lines are more sensitive to low fe availability than wild-type. thirdly, the induction of fe deficiency responsive genes that play pivotal roles in fe uptake are suppressed in osiro3-oe lines. together these data imply that osiro <dig> is a negative regulator of fe uptake in rice.

to date, a variety of bhlh transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in regulating fe uptake and homeostasis  <cit> . osiro <dig> is not phylogenetically related to other known bhlh transcription factors involved in the regulation of fe uptake, such as osiro <dig> and idef <dig>  <cit> . thus, it is a novel fe-responsive transcription factor. over-expression of osiro <dig> and idef <dig> increased the expression of fe uptake related gene transcripts and these plants also showed an enhanced tolerance to fe deficiency. thus, they are positive regulators of downstream fe responsive genes  <cit> . in contrast, this study revealed that over-expression of osiro <dig> results in hypersensitivity to fe deficiency, due to the suppression of induction of fe uptake related genes, suggesting it is a negative regulator. fe deficiency induces the activation of the methionine cycle and biosynthesis of ps in strategy ii plants  <cit> , a process which is nutrient and energy demanding. over-expression of na synthase alone, an enzyme catalyzing a rate limiting step of na and ps synthesis resulted in significantly reduced growth  <cit> . in addition, excessive fe acts as a catalyst for the formation of free radicals that are potent oxidizing agents which can damage many important biological molecules in cells  <cit> . thus, although the fe deficiency response results in increased fe uptake it also results in a growth penalty. therefore negative regulators are required to balance the induction of fe uptake components to reduce the negative effect on plant growth that results from excessive fe and/or as a result of the induction of the components due to fe deficiency. the fact that the induction of osiro <dig> is slightly later in shoots and at a lower level in roots compared to the positive regulator osiro <dig>  suggests that osiro <dig> may play a role as part of a negative feed back loop on the fe deficiency response.

the negative effect of osiro <dig> occurs via either a direct or indirect mechanism. as osiro <dig> induction lags that of osiro <dig>  it may be regulated by osiro <dig> to form a negative feedback loop. in fact, there is a putative osiro <dig> binding cis-element in the promoter region of osiro <dig> . bhlh transcription factors often function in homo- and/or hetero-dimerized forms  <cit> . osiro <dig> and osiro <dig> and/or idef <dig> regulate similar downstream targets, albeit in opposite manners. these transcription factors might interact with each other and/or bind to the same cis-acting regulatory elements in the promoter region of target genes. analysis of the expression of osiro <dig> and idef <dig> in different microarray data sets showed that these two genes are expressed antagonistically . there are a number of predicted proteins in arabidopsis and rice with high sequence similarity to osiro <dig> . the closest orthologue of osiro <dig> gene in arabidopsis, atbhlh <dig>  is also induced by fe deficiency . whether atbhlh <dig> plays a similar role in fe homeostasis in arabidopsis needs to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals the regulatory role of a bhlh protein, osiro <dig> in fe homeostasis in rice. osiro <dig> is specifically induced by fe deficiency, suggesting it functions in fe deficiency responses. the nuclear localization of osiro <dig> supports the hypothesis that osiro <dig> acts as a transcription factor. the hypersensitivity to low fe supply of the osiro3-oe and the inhibitory effect of osiro3-oe on the induction of fe deficiency response genes suggest osiro <dig> functions as a negative regulator in fe deficiency responses. the identification of the new important regulator adds to a growing understanding of the network of fine control of fe homeostasis.
