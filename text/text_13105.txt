BACKGROUND
the opportunistic pathogen staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as an important etiologic agent of nosocomial infections. the ability to form biofilms on the surfaces of medical devices is an important component of s. epidermidis pathogenicity. biofilm resistance to antibiotics and host defense mechanisms are often regulated by two-component signal transduction systems   <cit> .

biofilm formation proceeds in two distinct developmental phases: primary attachment of staphylococcal cells to a polystyrene surface followed by bacterial accumulation in multiple layers  <cit> . the initial adhesion of bacterial cells to a polymer surface is influenced by a variety of factors, including atle, embp, and other staphylococcal surface-associated proteins. during the bacterial accumulation phase in s. epidermidis, biofilm formation is mediated by extracellular polysaccharides and proteins, such as polysaccharide intercellular adhesin   <cit>  and accumulation-associated protein   <cit> . in addition to extracellular polysaccharides and proteins, extracellular dna  is a matrix component that is critical for bacterial attachment during the initial stage of biofilm formation  <cit> . extracellular dna release from s. epidermidis is related to atle-mediated bacterial autolysis  <cit> . another autolysin recently identified in s. epidermidis, aae, also has bacteriolytic activities and adhesive properties  <cit> .

tcss regulate bacterial adaptation, survival, virulence and biofilm formation  <cit> . tcss comprise a membrane-associated histidine kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. overall,  <dig> or  <dig> tcss have been identified in the genomes of s. epidermidis atcc <dig> or atcc <dig>  <cit> . in s. epidermidis, the tcs agrc/agra has been proven to negatively regulate biofilm formation  <cit> . in a previous study of the s. epidermidis saers tcs, a saer deletion mutant exhibited a lower anaerobic growth rate, a significantly reduced rate of nitrate utilization and a slightly higher biofilm-forming ability compared to the parental strain  <cit> . in s. aureus, the saers tcs influences biofilm formation  <cit>  and the expression of virulence-associated factors, such as protein a, α- and β-hemolysins, and coagulase  <cit> . however, whether saers regulates s. epidermidis autolysis and biofilm formation remains unclear.

in the present work, we constructed a se1457Δsaers mutant with deletion of the genes that encode both the histidine kinase  and the response regulator  by homologous recombination. the effects of the saers deletion on s. epidermidis autolysis, edna release, bacterial cell viability, and biofilm formation were investigated.

RESULTS
effect of saers deletion on s. epidermidis biofilm formation
in order to explore the influence of saer and saes on s. epidermidis biofilm formation, an s. epidermidis 1457Δsaers mutant  and a complemented strain  were constructed using the shuttle plasmids pmad and pbt <dig>  respectively. the biofilm-forming ability of se1457Δsaers on polystyrene plates was higher compared to the parental strain. although it did not reach the level of the wild-type strain, complementation of saers resulted in decreased biofilm formation  . the growth curves of se1457Δsaers and the parental strain were similar in either aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions .

scanning electron microscopy  of biofilms on catheters showed that se1457Δsaers biofilms contained more extracellular matrix compared to se <dig> and se1457saec biofilms . in planktonic cultures, intercellular adhesion of the se1457Δsaers and the wild-type strain was observed using transmission electron microscopy . while thread-like material between se1457Δsaers cells was observed, such material was rarely found between parental strain cells .

effect of saers deletion on the autolysis of s. epidermidis
to examine the effect of saers deletion on autolysis, triton x-100-induced autolysis of se1457Δsaers, se <dig>  and se1457saec was analyzed. bacterial cells were harvested at the mid-exponential phase grown in tsb medium containing  <dig> m nacl. following the addition of  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  se1457Δsaers cultures exhibited a much higher autolysis rate  compared to the wild-type strain; decreased autoloysis was partially restored in the complementation strain se1457saec .

the effect of saers deletion on murein hydrolase activity was determined by zymographic analysis using lyophilized micrococcus luteus  or s. epidermidis cells as substrates  <cit> . briefly, extracts from lysostaphin- and sds-treated s. epidermidis  cells and concentrated supernatants of the bacterial culture  were used to assess the murein hydrolase activities of each strain. as a control, extracts from the s. epidermidis atle deletion mutant se1457Δatle were used and resulted in only one lytic band . in contrast, extracts from se <dig>  se1457Δsaers and se1457saec displayed multiple bacteriolytic bands. the zymogram profiles of ex-sds from se1457Δsaers extracts showed more lytic bands  compared to the zymogram profiles of se <dig> and se1457saec extracts, indicating that autolysins may contribute to the increased autolysis of the mutant strain. the ex-lys and ex-sup zymogram profiles of se1457Δsaers were similar to the profiles observed for se <dig> and se1457saec .

effect of saers deletion on s. epidermidis viability in planktonic and biofilm states
to investigate whether the increased autolysis that resulted from saers deletion affected s. epidermidis cell viability, colony-forming unit  counts of the se <dig> and se1457Δsaers strains in the planktonic state were determined. cultures were inoculated with approximately  <dig> cfu/ml of each strain and incubated under normal conditions. at  <dig> h, se1457Δsaers and se <dig> had log cfu/ml counts of  <dig>  of and  <dig> , respectively. cfu counts were also similar at  <dig> h post-inoculation, with log cfu/ml counts of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for se1457Δsaers and se <dig> respectively. however, after  <dig> h, se1457Δsaers cultures had a lower cfu count  compared to the wild-type strain   .

the viability of se1457Δsaers and the wild-type strain in  <dig> h biofilm was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy  with live/dead staining  <cit> . more dead cells were observed in the se1457Δsaers biofilm compared to the wild-type strain .

effect of saers deletion on edna release from s. epidermidis
extracellular dna is an important component of the s. epidermidis biofilm matrix  <cit> , and its relative concentration in  <dig> h biofilms formed by se <dig>  se1457Δsaers and se1457saec was measured utilizing qpcr for gyra, lysa, serp <dig>  and leua  <cit> . extracellular dna concentrations were increased in the se1457Δsaers biofilms compared to the complementation strain and the wild-type strain .

when dnase i  was added prior to biofilm formation, the biomass of the se1457Δsaers biofilms was decreased by 4-fold ; in contrast, the biomasses of se <dig> and se1457saec biofilms were decreased by  <dig> -fold .

effect of edna release on se1457Δsaers primary attachment of se1457Δsaers
extracellular dna is a critical component for bacterial adhesion during the initial stage of biofilm development  <cit> . s. epidermidis cells attached to the polystyrene surface were counted under a microscope at 400× magnification. while  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per field were adhered for se <dig>  se1457Δsaers, and se1457saec strains, respectively, few attached se1457Δatle cells were observed. when dnase i  was added at the time of the attachment assay, se1457Δsaers cell attachment was significantly reduced by 85%. in contrast, following dnase i addition se <dig> and se1457saec attachment was reduced by 31% and 48%, respectively .

effect of saers deletion on pia production and aap expression of s. epidermidis
pia in the extracellular matrix of biofilms was detected using a dot blot assay with the wga-hrp conjugate. pia production levels were not significantly different in the se1457Δsaers strain compared to the se <dig> and se1457saec strains . when assessed by comparative proteomic analysis, expression of accumulation-associated protein , an important factor for intercellular adhesion, was up-regulated in se1457Δsaers compared to the wild-type strain . aap in lysostaphin-treated whole bacterial lysates of se1457Δsaers, se <dig> and se1457saec strains was detected by western blot using an anti-aap monoclonal antibody. the se1457Δsaers strain expressed more aap  compared to the wild-type and the complementation strains .

analysis of the autolysis-related gene transcription in se1457Δsaers
to investigate whether the transcription of autolysis-related genes was regulated by saers, dna microarray and rt-qpcr of total rnas from the se1457Δsaers and the wild-type strains were performed. expression of numerous autolysis-related genes including lyts , lrga , serp <dig> , glpq , arlr , atle , and aae  was found to be up-regulated in se1457Δsaers strain . transcription of the genes in the saers operon  in the se1457Δsaers strain was not detected.

discussion
as staphylococci biofilm formation is influenced by external factors such as glucose, nacl, temperature, aerobiosis-anaerobiosis, static-dynamic conditions, and ph  <cit> , it suggests that there are mechanisms that can sense environmental signals and regulate bacterial biofilm formation. in s. epidermidis, the agrc/a tcs has been proven to negatively regulate biofilm formation  <cit> , while the lyts/r tcs has been shown to positively regulate bacterial autolysis  <cit> . in s. aureus, the saers tcs influences biofilm formation  <cit>  and the expression of virulence-associated factors  <cit> , whereas in s. epidermidis, a mutant with saer deletion showed a slightly higher biofilm-forming ability compared to the parental strain  <cit> .

in the present study, se1457Δsaers, a saer and saes deletion mutant from s. epidermidis  <dig>  was constructed by homologous recombination. although saers in s. epidermidis atcc  <dig> and s. aureus newman are similar both at nucleotide sequence level  and at the amino acid level , both biofilm formation and autolysis were up-regulated in se1457Δsaers, suggesting that saers in s. epidermidis plays a different role from that in s. aureus. additionally, when examined by sem, increased quantities of extracellular polymeric substances  were observed in the se1457Δsaers biofilm compared to the se <dig> and se1457saec biofilms .

aap expression and pia synthesis are important for biofilm formation. therefore, we examined the contribution of aap and pia to se1457Δsaers biofilm formation. in s. epidermidis, aap plays an important role in biofilm formation, and biofilm-positive strains that express aap show higher biofilm forming abilities than strains that lack the aap protein  <cit> . in se1457Δsaers, aap up-regulation was detected using 2-de and confirmed by western blot, suggesting that aap is a factor associated with the enhanced biofilm formation capacity of se1457Δsaers. pia plays a major role in intercellular adhesion in s. epidermidis biofilms  <cit> . however, no obvious differences in either pia production or transcription of icaa, the gene that encodes an n-acetylglucosaminyl transferase enzyme critical for pia synthesis, were observed between se1457Δsaers and se <dig> . these results are consistent with the findings reported for a saer deletion mutant by handke et al.  <cit> .

the enhanced s. epidermidis biofilm formation may be correlated with the increased amounts of edna released in the biofilm matrix  <cit> . quantitative pcr revealed that edna release from s. epidermidis 1457Δsaers was up-regulated . furthermore, the biomass of se1457Δsaers biofilms was markedly decreased compared to se <dig> and se1457saec biofilms when dnase i was added prior to biofilm formation.

extracellular dna is known to be released following bacterial autolysis  <cit> . se1457Δsaers showed a higher level of triton x-100-induced autolysis compared to the wild-type strain in tsb medium containing  <dig> m nacl. in accordance with the enhanced autolysis of se1457Δsaers, extracts from sds-treated se1457Δsaers cells exhibited more bacteriolytic bands compared to extracts from the wild-type strain. these results indicate that saers influenced the activity of autolysins that bind non-covalently to the s. epidermidis cell wall. in s. aureus, autolysis is a complicated process regulated by the lytsr tcs  <cit>  and global regulators such as mgra and sara  <cit> . autolysis is influenced by a variety of different factors such as nacl, ph, temperature, and growth phase, suggesting the existence of a mechanism that can sense environmental conditions  <cit> . however, zhu et al. have demonstrated that the lytsr tcs in s. epidermidis is not involved in triton x-100-induced autolysis and does not alter the zymogram profile  <cit> , indicating that a different mechanism for autolysis regulation exists in s. epidermidis. the findings in the present study suggest that the saers tcs may regulate s. epidermidis autolysis.

the increased autolysis rate observed in se1457Δsaers may also be associated with the up-regulated expression of autolysins. in s. epidermidis, atle and aae are important autolysins  <cit> . atle is expressed as a  <dig> kda precursor protein that is proteolytically processed to release the gl  and am domains   <cit> . aae, a  <dig> kda protein, contains three repetitive sequences in its n-terminal portion. these repeats comprise features of a putative peptidoglycan binding domain  found in several enzymes that are involved in cell-wall metabolism. aae from s. epidermidis o- <dig> exhibited bacteriolytic activity in zymographic analysis using s. carnosus or s. epidermidis cells as a substrate. in the present study, atle and aae transcription was up-regulated in se1457Δsaers , which may account for the increase in bacteriolytic bands in the zymogram assay. in addition, expression of numerous autolysis-related genes in se1457Δsaers, such as lyts, lrga, arlr, serp <dig> and glpq, were also up-regulated, suggesting that s. epidermidis autolysis mediated by saers may be influenced by other factors that remain to be defined.

transcriptional profile analysis of the saers mutant and the wild-type strain found  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the present study, whereas in the handke's study, only  <dig> genes in the saer mutant were differentially expressed compared to the wild-type strain. the deletion of saers in s. epidermidis affects genes with a variety of functions, including bacterial autolysis , biofilm formation , leucine biosynthesis , protein hydrolysis , stress resistance , and cell viability . three genes with increased expression, pflb , pfla  and lrga  in se1457Δsaers, overlapped with the saer deletion mutant. the discrepancies of the microarray data between the saer mutant and the saers mutant may result from crosstalk between saes and the response regulators of other tcss. when the transcriptional profiles of the saers deletion mutant was compared to the s. aureus strains n <dig>  col, and newman, only three differentially expressed genes, geh , efb  and lrga , were found to overlap  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest a different role for saers in s. epidermidis from that in s. aureus.

through the use of regulatory sequence analysis tools , we further analyzed the upstream regions of the genes that were differentially expressed in se1457Δsaers compared to the wild-type strain for the gttaan6gttaa saer-binding motif in s. aureus reported by sun et al.  <cit> . only eight genes involved in metabolic process  that contained the direct repeat sequence with no more than one mismatch were found , suggesting that the potential role of saers in autolysis regulation in s. epidermidis may be different from its role in s. aureus.

a these genes are identified in microarray analysis.

b the start point and end point are the distance from the translation start codon.

c conserved repeat sequences are underlined.

CONCLUSIONS
the deletion of saers in s. epidermidis resulted in the alteration of bacterial autolysis, increased edna release, and decreased bacterial cell viability in the planktonic/biofilm states. further, aap expression and the transcription of autolysin genes such as atle and aae were up-regulated. overall, these alterations were associated with the increased biofilm-forming ability of the saers deletion mutant. the present study suggests that in s. epidermidis, the saers tcs plays an important role in regulating bacterial autolysis, which is related to biofilm formation.
