BACKGROUND
the inducible regulatory t cells, or itreg, differ from the naturally regulatory t cells  in that the former are generated in the periphery through encounter with environmental antigens. it is also believed that itreg play non-overlapping roles, relative to ntreg, in regulating peripheral tolerance  <cit> . most itreg reported to date have been cd25+ cells , and it is well established that their induction requires suboptimal stimulation of the t cell receptor  and cytokines tgf-β and il- <dig>  <cit> . the cd25+ itreg thus appear to derive primarily from weakly stimulated cd4+ t cells.

we previously identified a different subset of itreg in mice that is cd25- . the cd25- itreg were induced after co-immunization using a protein antigen and a dna vaccine encoding the same antigen  <cit> . unlike that of the cd25+ itreg, the induction of the cd25- itreg involved the generation of cd40low il-10high tolerogenic dendritic cells , which in turn stimulated cd25- itreg in an antigen-specific manner  <cit> . we further showed in mouse models that this subset of itreg was potentially useful as a therapeutic for allergic and autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, flea allergic dermatitis , and type  <dig> diabetes   <cit> .

while the requirement for weak antigen stimulation is well established for the induction of cd25+ itreg, it is unclear whether the same is true for the induction of cd25- itreg. addressing this question will allow us not only to further differentiate the two subsets of itreg, but also to maximize the tolerogenicity of co-immunization by choosing t cell epitopes of appropriate antigenicity. in this report, we show that strong antigen stimulation is required for efficient induction of cd25- itreg.

RESULTS
mhc-ag:tcr interaction is required for induction of cd25- itreg
to test whether the mhc-ag:tcr interaction is required for the induction of cd25- itreg, we employed an in vitro itreg induction system. it involved culture of cd4+ t cells together with co-immunization-induced tolerogenic dcs that presented the dominant epitope of hen ovalbumin, ova323- <dig>  using either clonotypic cd4+ t cells from do <dig>  balb/c mice or polyclonal cd4+ t cells from ovalbumin-sensitized balb/c mice, we found that the induction of cd25- itreg in either case could be blocked by anti-mhc-ii antibody and, therefore, was mhc-ii-dependent. thus, antigenic stimulation is essential for the induction of cd25- itreg .

highly antigenic epitopes are required for efficient induction of highly active cd25- itreg
to further determine how antigenicity affects cd25- itreg induction, we generated a set of mutated epitopes from ova323- <dig>  using a tetramer staining-based epitope competition assay, we assessed the affinity of each of the mutated epitopes for mhc ii. the result showed the order of affinity to be ova323- <dig> > mt <dig> > mt <dig> = mt <dig> . consistently with this result, in vitro t cell proliferation assays using do <dig>  cd4+ t cells showed a similar order in t cell stimulating activity . we therefore selected the epitopes ova323- <dig>  mt <dig>  and mt <dig> as probes for antigenicity studies.

to that end, balb/c mice  were treated by co-immunization using the dna and protein combination corresponding to the ova323- <dig>  mt <dig>  or mt <dig> epitope . seven days after the treatment, splenocytes were isolated and analyzed for cd25- itreg induction. the result showed increased frequency of foxp3+ cells in the cd4+cd25- , but not the cd4+cd25+ , cell population in the treated mice, compared to that of untreated control mice  . importantly, the magnitude of increase followed the order of co <dig> > comt <dig> > comt <dig>  suggesting that efficient induction of cd25- itreg by co-immunization required highly antigenic epitopes.

to further determine the impact of antigenicity on the function of cd25- itreg, we compared the suppressive activity of cd25- itreg induced by co <dig>  comt <dig>  and comt <dig> using an in vitro suppression assay. all cd25- itreg cells suppressed the ova323-339-specific proliferation of reporter cd4+ t cells in co-culture as expected. however, their relative suppressive activity followed the same order of co <dig> > comt <dig> > comt <dig> , suggesting that more antigenic epitopes also induce functionally more active cd25- itreg cells.

to repeat this observation in vivo, we adoptively transferred cd25- itreg induced with the different epitopes into balb/c mice and then attempted to sensitize the animals with ova323- <dig> in incomplete freund's adjuvant . one week later, we isolated splenic cd4+ t cells from the sensitized mice and measured recall activation of cd4+ t effector cells by an in vitro restimulation assay. again, although all transferred cd25- itreg blocked the recall proliferation of t cells to some degree, their relative effectiveness varied with the inducing epitopes, in the order of co <dig> > comt <dig> > comt <dig> . moreover, splenic cd4+ t cells isolated from the recipients showed decreased expression of ifn-γ and increased expression il- <dig>  the extent of which also followed the same order . taken together, these results show that highly antigenic epitopes are required for more efficient induction of highly suppressive cd25- itreg.

highly antigenic epitopes are also required for more effective prevention of flea allergic dermatitis
flea allergic dermatitis is a cd4+ t cell-mediated allergic reaction to flea allergen  <cit> . to extend our finding to this disease model, we chose two antigenic epitopes from the flea allergen fsa <dig>  namely p <dig>  and p <dig> . p <dig> was predicted to have a higher affinity to mhc ii  than p <dig>  we confirmed this prediction by sensitizing c57bl/ <dig> mice  with full-length fsa <dig>  followed by an in vitro restimulation assay using one of the epitopes. we found that p <dig> indeed induced significantly more vigorous t cell proliferation than did p <dig> .

to see whether the difference in antigenicity influences the induction of cd25- itreg cells by these two epitopes, we prophylactically treated c57bl/ <dig> mice with co-immunization using the combination of dna and protein vaccines targeting each epitope . seven days after co-immunization, the animals were sensitized with flea saliva extracts, followed by a delayed-type hypersensitivity assay to determine to which extent the prophylactic co-immunization had prevented the development of an allergic reaction. both the wheal size analysis and histological examination showed a stronger protective effect by co <dig> than by co <dig>  as indicated by smaller wheal diameters  and fewer mononuclear infiltrates  at the reaction site. the co100-treated mice also had fewer mast cells and a lower level of degranulation at the reaction site . in vitro recall activation also confirmed a weaker t cell response in the co <dig> group . importantly, p <dig> also induced more cd25- itreg than p <dig> , suggesting that p <dig> protected animals more effectively by inducing more cd25- itreg.

to determine whether this is indeed the case, we adoptively transferred cd25- itreg cells induced by co <dig> or co <dig> into fsa1-sensitized mice and challenged the recipients with flea antigens. again, recipients receiving co100-induced cd25- itreg cells showed significantly reduced dth response than those receiving co66-induced counterpart . collectively, these results confirm in this disease model that highly antigenic epitopes are required for more efficient induction of therapeutic cd25- itreg.

discussion
we have shown for the first time that efficient induction of highly active cd25- itreg cells requires highly antigenic epitopes for t cells. the finding is based on 1) anti-mhc-ii mab blocked the induction cd25- itreg cells in vitro ; 2) ova323- <dig> mutants with decreased antigenicity for t cells showed decreased ability to induce active cd25- itreg cells ; and 3) a similar observation was made in a mouse model of flea allergic dermatitis, where cd25- itreg cells induced by a more antigenic epitope were also more effective in preventing the development of the disease .

given that flea allergic dermatitis is a disease driven primarily by effector cd4+ t cells, our observation that the cd25- itreg cells are effective at suppressing this disease suggests that these cells function, at least partly, by suppressing effector cd4+ t cells. a similar mechanism of action has long been described for other types of treg cells, including both the natural  and induced cd4+ treg cells that display the cd25+foxp3+ phenotype  <cit> . thus, despite displaying a different phenotype  and requiring strong antigenic stimulation for induction, the cd25- itreg cells described in the present work may exert their regulatory function similarly to the other types of treg cells, i.e. by inhibiting the activity of other immune cells, particularly t cells and antigen presenting cells, in a cell contact-dependent and/or -independent manner. future investigation is needed to determine whether this is indeed the case.

itreg cells are potentially useful as therapeutics for allergy, autoimmune diseases, and transplant rejection  <cit> . the present study thus has the translational importance by uncovering the need for choosing highly antigenic epitopes for effective induction of cd25- itreg. at present, immunosuppressant treatment is the only means to control immune disorders and pathology, which is unfortunately associated with many side effects, including increased risk of infection and cancer  <cit> . in vivo induction of cd25- itreg cells, which are antigen-specific, provides a novel means of controlling immune diseases while avoiding global immunosuppression.

despite their therapeutic potential, it remains to be determined whether the cd25- itreg cells are functionally stable for use in therapy. it is worth noting that cd25+ itreg, which are induced by tgf-beta  <cit> ; have been shown to lose  <cit>  or maintain  <cit>  the foxp3+ phenotype, and suppressive activity, depending on certain conditions. in our system, the cd25- itreg cells appeared to remain foxp3+ and function well  <dig> days after being induced in vivo via co-immunization, as judged by both the in vitro  and in vivo  assays. nonetheless, these cells need to be followed for a much longer-term in order to assess their long-term functional stability.

it is interesting to note that strong antigenic epitopes are a known requirement for efficient induction of effector t cells. how does this same requirement differentiate itreg versus conventional t cells? our published work suggests that the differentiating factor is likely to be the tolerogenic dcs generated under the condition of co-immunization, which serve as an endogenous tolerogenic adjuvant  <cit> . it is therefore likely that either the strongly antigenic epitopes are involved in the generation of tolerogenic dcs or they preferentially stimulate itreg in combination with the tolerogenic dcs. the two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. we are in process to investigate these possibilities.

the complex of mhc-epitope :tcr is pivotal in t cell immunity, and a strong interaction between pmhc and tcr induces stronger t cell activation  <cit> . but controversy remains, about within this complex, which affinity is effective, epitope to mhc, or pmhc to tcr. however the issue is of theoretical importance only in a system that employs clonotypic t cells, such as the do <dig>  tcr-transgenic mice; in contrast, in normal animals, the affinity of epitopes to mhc is presumably more important because the resulting pmhc spontaneously selects responding t cells with the highest-affinity tcr from a repertoire of t cells. consistent with this assumption, our data showed that epitopes with predicted higher affinity to mhc also induced stronger t cell responses in both balb/c mice and the mouse model of flea allergic dermatitis. thus, in the limited wild-type animals that we have tested, it appears that strong antigenicity, and efficient induction of cd25- itreg, can be predicted from the affinity of epitope to mhc.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we believe that highly therapeutically effective cd25- itreg may be induced by co-immunization targeting one or several disease-related or specific antigens, and by selecting antigenic epitopes of highest antigenicity for t cells as the immunogen.
