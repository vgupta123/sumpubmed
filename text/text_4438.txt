BACKGROUND
in recent years, the efficient use of plant biomass, especially non-food lignocellulosic biomass as renewable resource for biotechnological applications has become increasingly important  <cit> . this lignocellulosic biomass is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin  <cit> . xylan is a major component of hemicellulose, which is the second most abundant plant material in nature and constitutes up to 35% of the total dry weight of higher plants  <cit> .

the chemical structure of xylan is complex. it consists of a homopolymeric backbone chain of β- <dig> -linked d-xylose units and short side chains including different amounts of α-l-arabinofuranosyl-, o-acetyl-, p-coumaroyl-, feruloyl-, d-glucuronopyranosyl- or 4-o-methyl-d-glucuronopyranosyl residues depending on the type of plant  <cit> . due to this complexity, several enzyme classes are involved in the breakdown of xylan. hemicellulases, such as β-d-galactanases, β-d-mannanases or β-d-xylanases, hydrolyze the  <dig> -beta-d-glycosidic linkages anywhere in the xylan chain  <cit> . before extensive degradation of the backbone, other enzymes such as acetylesterases, α-glucuronidases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases, ferulic acid esterases or p-coumaric acid esterases remove side chains and substitutes  <cit> . once xylanases have released small xylooligosaccharides, the β-xylosidases cleave the oligomeric fragments, predominantly to xylose  <cit> . additionally, there are many cellulolytic enzymes, which have xylanolytic activity as a secondary function  <cit> . synergistic interactions of all these enzymes are required for the efficient degradation of xylan and the exact combination of these enzymes varies from species to species, often with a high degree of redundancy.

xylan degrading enzymes are produced by a wide variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi, but also algae, protozoa, gastropods and anthropods  <cit> . many of these are saprotrophs, requiring these enzymes for plant degradation and liberation of xylose, a primary carbon source for cell metabolism. others are plant pathogens requiring hemicellulose degradation for plant cell infection  <cit> . common well-studied xylan degrading organisms are for instance trichoderma or aspergillus species  <cit> . most of their xylan degrading enzymes are identified, characterized and also expressed in other xylanase negative organisms such as escherichia coli or saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . in addition to their natural function, xylanases also have a broad range of industrial biotechnological applications including bio bleaching of wood pulp, treatment of animal feed to increase digestibility, processing of food and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to sugars, which can subsequently be converted into liquid fuels, solvents and other chemicals  <cit> . especially for the latter applications, organisms efficiently breaking down lignocellulosic biomass are required.

the utilization of raw biomass components for the production of valuable chemicals has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. ideally, these cheap biomass compounds are utilized by microorganisms that  produce such valuable chemicals. ustilago maydis shows this high biotechnological potential and is known to produce chemicals such as glycolipids, itaconic, malic or succinic acid  <cit> . it is a phytopathogenic fungus and belongs to the group of basidiomycota. it is a biotrophic parasite that causes smut disease in maize, which is characterized by the formation of tumors, called galls, on aerial plant tissue  <cit> . couturier et al. identified ustilago maydis as the organism with the best biomass-hydrolysis potential out of  <dig> sequenced fungi such as trichoderma reesei, aspergillus terreus or rhizopus oryzae  <cit> . comparing the genomes and secretomes, u. maydis showed the widest range of enzymatic activities including  <dig> hydrolytic enzymes such as polysaccharide hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases and pectin esterases  <cit> . nevertheless, the xylanolytic activity of u. maydis is lower than that of a. niger or fusarium graminearum  <cit> . these predictions are in line with müller et al. proposing that the secretome of u. maydis contains a complete set of hydrolytic enzymes  <cit> . in contrast, fungi such as magnaporthe grisea and f. graminearum have more genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, but the variation is lower  <cit> . however, the biotrophic lifestyle of u. maydis is geared towards minimizing damage to the host to prevent the release of cell wall fragments, which might trigger plant defense responses  <cit> . further, the conditions under which the hydrolytic enzymes are expressed can be very specific  <cit> .

most of u. maydis’ enzymes are not at all or not completely characterized so far. cano-canchola et al. have described xylanase, pectate lyase, polygalacturonase and cellulase activities in u. maydis, but these activities were not linked to specific genes or enzymes  <cit> . in this study, we confirm the ability of u. maydis mb <dig> to degrade xylan and identify an endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase, encoded by um <dig>  as one of the major components of xylan degradation.

methods
strains, media and growth conditions
ustilago maydis strain mb <dig>  was used in this work. the fungus was cultivated on yeps medium consisting of  <dig> g l- <dig> yeast extract,  <dig> g l- <dig> d-sucrose, and  <dig> g l- <dig> peptone for at least  <dig> h at 28°c and  <dig> rpm. physiological experiments were performed in  <dig> ml minimal medium  containing  <dig>  g l- <dig> nh4cl,  <dig>  g l- <dig> kh2po <dig>   <dig>  g l- <dig> mgso <dig>   <dig>  g l- <dig> feso <dig> and  <dig> g l- <dig> of varying carbon sources such as xylan from birch wood , glucose and xylose in  <dig> ml erlenmeyer flasks at 28°c and  <dig> rpm. through the process of autoclaving, xylan was almost completely dissolved. all cultures were inoculated to a starting od <dig> of  <dig> .

escherichia coli dh5α  was used as a host for dna manipulation and was grown in lysogeny broth  medium at 37°c and  <dig> rpm. for plasmid selection, recombinant e. coli dh5α strains were grown in the presence of  <dig> mg l- <dig> ampicillin.

the surface display strain s. cerevisiae eby <dig> was cultivated according to the manufacturer’s manual .

analytical methods
cell densities were measured by determining the absorption at  <dig> nm with a unico spectrophotometer  <dig>  for dry weight determination  <dig> ml culture broth was filtered using macherey-nagel paper mn218b  and weighed after drying at 110°c for  <dig> h.

the ammonium concentration in the culture supernatant was measured by a colorimetric method according to willis using salicylate and nitroprusside  <cit> .

the concentration of reducing sugars was determined by a modified version of the nelson somogyi assay  <cit> . a fresh working solution  was prepared.  <dig>  ml of this solution were added to  <dig>  ml sample containing not more than  <dig>  g l- <dig> reducing sugars and the mixture was boiled for  <dig> min. after cooling on ice,  <dig>  ml of staining solution 6mo7o <dig> 4•h2o,  <dig> %  h2so <dig> and  <dig> g l- <dig> na2haso <dig> 7•h2o) were added and mixed for  <dig>  min. reducing sugar concentrations were determined from absorbance at  <dig> nm. a standard curve was prepared using appropriate amounts of xylose .

xylan degradation products were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography .  <dig> μl of the culture broth and standards were spotted on a silica gel sil g- <dig> tlc plate . 50%  formate, 33%  butanol and 17%  h2o were used as running buffer. for staining, the plate was dipped in a mix of 90%  ethanol and 10%  of an aqueous  <dig> g l- <dig> h2so <dig> solution followed by  <dig> min of heating at 130°c.  <dig> g l- <dig> xylan,  <dig> g l- <dig> xylose,  <dig> g l- <dig> xylobiose and  <dig> g l- <dig> xylotriose solutions served as standards.

for identification of proteins present in the supernatant of an u. maydis culture  <dig> ml culture broth was centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the supernatant was lyophilized and resuspended in  <dig> ml  <dig> mm tris–hcl ph  <dig> . for protein separation a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  on nupage®novex® 12% bis-tris mini gels in nupage® mops sds running buffer was performed according to the manufacturers manual . the gel was stained with a  <dig> %  coomassie blue r- <dig> solution for  <dig> min. favored slots were cut out and de-stained in 5%  methanol and 7%  acetic acid. the de-stained gel slices were washed and equilibrated in  <dig> μl 30%  acetonitrile in  <dig>  m ammonium hydrogen carbonate for  <dig> min. afterwards, the supernatant was discarded and the residual acetonitrile was removed in a speed vac vacuum centrifuge. further steps, such as trypsin-digestion, liquid chromatography peptide fractionation, matrix preparation, maldi-tof/tof mass spectrometry and database search, required for the identification of the expressed proteins, were kindly performed by benjamin müller  and are described in additional file  <dig> 

cloning procedures
standard cloning-related techniques were performed according to sambrook et al.  <cit> . as a reference sequence the genomic sequence of u. maydis  <dig>  was used.

a gene replacement construct for disruption of umxyn11a  was constructed by a reverse genetic approach described by brachmann et al.  <cit> . an upstream flank was amplified from u. maydis mb <dig> genomic dna with the primers lf-fwd 5’-gtcaatattcttgttaacgatctcagcctcatg-3’ and lf-rev 5’-actggccatctaggcccttgaatgttcgaagaagagatcgatggc-3’ by pcr.

similarly, the downstream flank was amplified with the primers rf-fwd 5’-agcggcctgagtggccacgttgagaggccggatcggacagg-3’ and rf-rev 5’- gacaatattgaccatcagattctttcagtccatgcc-3’. the hygromycin resistance cassette originated from the vector pmf1h  <cit> . the flanks and the hygromycin resistance cassette were digested with sfii  and ligated to obtain the complete replacement construct. this construct was transformed into u. maydis mb <dig> protoplasts. successful homologous integration was tested by colony pcr and single copy integration was verified via southern blot analysis.

the strain s. cerevisiae eby100/pyd1+umxyn11a expressing the putative endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase  of u. maydis mb <dig> on its cell surface was constructed as follows. the umxyn11a gene  was amplified with primers 5’- aaaaaagaattcatgaagtttgccactgtccttgc-3’ and 5’-aaaaaagagcggccgccaaccagagacggacatcgaggc-3’ from u. maydis mb <dig> genomic dna by pcr. the umxyn11a gene and the cell surface display vector pyd <dig>  were digested with ecori and noti . afterwards the fragment was ligated into the vector and transformed into e. coli dh5α to obtain the strain e. coli dh5α/pyd1+umxyn11a. the umxyn11a gene was sequenced to confirm the correct sequence and orientation. the transformation of the vector pyd1+ umxyn11a in s. cerevisiae eby <dig> and expression of the umxyn11a on the cell surface was performed according to the manufacturer’s manual.

RESULTS
xylan degradation by ustilago maydis mb215
in order to characterize the xylan degrading abilities of u. maydis, strain mb <dig> was cultivated in minimal medium with xylan as sole carbon source . growth stopped after  <dig> h at a maximal od <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , corresponding to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> cell dry weight . the maximal growth rate was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h- <dig>  given this low biomass concentration in comparison to the initial substrate of  <dig> g l- <dig>  approximately half of the c-source was likely still present. during the same time the ammonium concentration in the supernatant decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> 

the cessation of growth after  <dig> h, despite the availability of an n and c source, is probably caused by the ph drop from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the ammonium consumption of  <dig> mm accompanied by an equal release of protons lowers the ph by  <dig> , which is in line with figure  <dig>  u. maydis is known to secrete small organic acids such as itaconic, 2-hydroxyparaconic, itatartaric, and malic acid  <cit> , but hplc analysis could not detect any of these in the culture supernatant .

u. maydis species are known to grow at low ph levels down to  <dig>  <cit> , which was also confirmed by control experiments with xylose as sole carbon source . the cultures on xylose showed a similar growth behavior, ph trend and n consumption with a final cell dry weight of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> compared to cultures grown on xylan . apparently the xylan degrading enzymes had low activity around ph  <dig> which is in line with other fungal xylanases showing enzymatic activity in a ph range of 3– <dig>  <cit> .

xylan degradation was indirectly determined via quantification of released reducing sugars using the nelson somogyi method . the maximal reducing sugar concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> after  <dig> h of cultivation. this concentration decreased rapidly after the ph drop at  <dig> h of cultivation to a stable value of about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> 

additionally, xylan degradation was confirmed by visualizing the hydrolysis products via tlc . in the first phase of cultivation different xylo-oligosaccharides accumulated, but after  <dig> h only xylotriose was left in the supernatant, indicating the presence of a xylanase with endo-acting nature  <cit> . xylobiose and xylose itself were not found , likely because they were consumed and utilized for biomass formation. these results are in line with the theory of collins et al. proposing that xylanases are excreted in small amounts into the medium liberating xylo-oligomers, which may be transported into the cell for continuing degradation by beta-xylosidases or intracellular xylanases and induction of further xylanase expression  <cit> . intracellular xylanases are known for example in bacillus stearothermophilus or prevotella bryantii as well as intracellular xylosidases in klebsiella oxytoca <cit> . this fast xylo-oligomer uptake and intracellular degradation can also be advantageous in densely populated ecosystems concerning the interspecies competition for nutrients  <cit> .

interestingly, after  <dig> h a gel-like precipitate in high concentrations  was observed . this precipitation coincided with the drop in reducing sugars  and the disappearance of the high molecular weight  spot at the bottom of the tlc . control experiments under the same conditions with xylose or glucose instead of xylan did not show this precipitation, nor did it occur in xylan containing medium without inoculation, even when the ph was reduced to  <dig>  with dl-malic acid. thus, the precipitate is likely the result of a modification of the hmw xylan by u. maydis mb <dig>  the precipitate was not soluble in water, methanol or ethanol, but it dissolved completely in a  <dig> m naoh solution indicating that it contains a carboxylic acid moiety. possibly, acidic side chains such as glucopyranosyluronic acid formed during the xylan degradation, causing the precipitation in the low ph environment  <cit> .

identification of u. maydis’ xylanases
to find the enzymes responsible for xylan degradation, we searched for probable xylan degrading enzymes in the genome of the reference strain u. maydis  <dig>  according to müller et al. at least  <dig> open reading frames  are present in the secretome of u. maydis, whose products could be responsible for the xylan degradation  <cit> . four of these enzymes are putative endo- <dig> -beta-xylanases , three alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases , two beta-galactosidases  and acetylxylan-esterases  and one arabinoxylan arabinfuranohydrolase   <cit> .

maldi-tof analysis of a u. maydis mb <dig> culture grown on xylan confirmed that the putative endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase encoded by um <dig>  was present in the supernatant, together with other biomass degrading enzymes such as arabinoxylan arabinfuranohydrolases, glucanases, glycosyl hydrolases and galactosidases . altogether  <dig> proteins were found in the supernatant of which  <dig> have putative biomass degrading activity.

a: numbers are given for both analyses of a biological replicate.

b: cazy families are signed according to cantarel et al.  <cit> .

the other probable xylan degrading enzymes were not present in the supernatant, although they were predicted as secreted enzymes containing a signal peptide cleavage site in their amino acid sequences  <cit> . different regulatory induction mechanisms could be a reason for the absence of these enzymes in the supernatant, since certain external conditions  are required for their expression  <cit> .

all proteins identified in table  <dig> were also found by couturier et al. except for one . however, altogether fewer proteins were found in our study, which can be explained by the fact that couturier et al. used complex media with maize bran as carbon source. this indicates that the induction of different components of the biomass-degrading machinery of u. maydis is individually regulated.

in order to characterize the xylan degrading ability of u. maydis we concentrated on the identified putative endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase. um <dig> is defined as umxyn11a since the enzyme belongs to the gh <dig> family  <cit> . first annotation was done by couturier et al.  <cit> . according to the mumdb ustilago database the umxyn11a gene  has a size of  <dig> nt and does not contain predicted introns  <cit> .

effect of the deletion of um <dig> on ustilago maydis mb215
to confirm the xylanase activity of umxyn11a, we deleted the corresponding orf and checked the xylan degradation ability of this deletion mutant. notably, the deletion of the umxyn11a gene reduced the growth rate of the mutant u. maydis mb <dig> Δ <dig> on minimal medium with xylan to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h- <dig> compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h- <dig> of the wildtype . the deletion mutant reached a final od <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the wildtype culture. however, the final cdw of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> is similar to the wildtype. the drop of the ph value from initially  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  was approximately  <dig> h delayed in comparison to u. maydis mb <dig> . also the maximal concentration of reducing sugars was lower , and occurred  <dig> h later than in the wildtype culture . in the end of cultivation the reducing sugar concentration decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g l- <dig> similar to the wildtype. analyzing hydrolytic products via tlc also showed that the release of smaller xylo-oligosaccharides by the deletion mutant was slower than in the wildtype. after  <dig> h, xylotriose was the only xylo-oligosaccharide detectable in the supernatant. these results indicate that the deletion of the selected umxyn11a locus had a negative influence on the rate of xylan degradation of u. maydis mb <dig> Δ <dig>  although the overall growth on xylan was not affected. redundant xylan-degrading activity of the other mentioned xylanases was apparently still sufficient to support growth. the deletion mutant growing on xylose as sole carbon source showed the same growth rate and n-consumption as the wildtype indicating no polar effect of the umxyn11a deletion . this confirmed the assumption, that the deleted orf is involved in the xylan degradation and not in growth processes or xylose uptake mechanism.

heterologous expression of umxyn11a on the cell surface of saccharomyces cerevisiae
for further confirmation of the xylanase activity we displayed the umxyn11a on the cell surface of a xylanase-negative strain, s. cerevisiae eby <dig>  this strain can neither utilize xylan nor xylose nor xylo-oligosaccharides  <cit> . with the help of the cell surface display vector pyd <dig>  we constructed the strain s. cerevisiae eby100/pyd1+umxyn11a, expressing the umxyn11a attached to the cell surface via disulphide bonds after induction with galactose. the correct expression of umxyn11a was confirmed by western analysis . the strain s. cerevisiae eby100/pyd <dig> was used as a negative control.

the enzyme activity of the displayed umxyn11a was determined by measuring the increase of released reducing sugars. after  <dig> h  <dig>  g l- <dig> reducing sugars were formed upon incubation of s. cerevisiae eby100/pyd1+umxyn11a with  <dig> g l- <dig> xylan solution by the displayed umxyn11a, compared to  <dig>  g l- <dig> reducing sugars in the negative control not expressing any xylan degrading enzymes . therefore, the strain s. cerevisiae eby100/pyd1+umxyn11a almost completely degraded xylan to xylotriose, which was additionally confirmed by tlc .

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that u. maydis mb <dig> is able to degrade xylan. the recombinant expression of umxyn11a  supports that it is involved in xylan degradation, and the resulting degradation products are in accordance with the activity of an endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase  <cit> . as already suggested by the genome sequence, the deletion mutant shows that u. maydis mb <dig> possesses other genes coding for xylan degrading enzymes. for comparison with other xylanases of well-characterized strains, such as t. reesei, further characterization has to be performed concerning the determination of the specific enzyme activity, substrate specificity or ph and temperature optima.

this xylan degradation ability together with its unicellular and yeast-like growth makes u. maydis mb <dig> a promising candidate for the production of valuable chemicals such as itaconic acid or glycolipids from lignocellulosic biomass. thus, the characterization of this enzyme is a further step towards the biotechnological application of u. maydis and its enzymes.
