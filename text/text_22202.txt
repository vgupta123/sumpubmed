BACKGROUND
human alpha-fetoprotein  is a tumor-associated fetal glycoprotein that functions in regulation of both ontogenic and oncogenic growth  <cit> . it consists of  <dig> disulfide bridges located at positions equivalent to human albumin, leading to a three dimensional structure that is similar to human albumin  <cit> . one of the biological properties of afp is its regulatory effects on immune responses. in hepatocellular carcinoma  patients with high levels of afp, antigen presenting cells  are dysfunctional. this leads to the suppression of t- and b-cells response  <cit> . dendritic cells  are the most potent apcs and are important for the initiation of the immune response against pathogens and tumors. in an in vitro experiment, um et al.  reported that afp treatment of dcs reduced the ability of monocyte-derived dc  to produce il- <dig> and induces apoptosis of mddc  <cit> . however, it is still unclear which domain of the afp plays the important role in apoptosis or impairment of the dc functions.

the aims of this study were to produce recombinant afp domain  proteins in an escherichia coli expression system and to investigate the immunoregulatory properties of each d-afp and to compare them to full length -afp. secretion of il- <dig> by mddc after treatment with d-afp and fl-afp was also analyzed.

RESULTS
cloning, expression, and purification of alpha-fetoprotein domains
several e. coli expressing plasmid constructs were made to generate the recombinant afps. recombinant afp plasmids containing domain  <dig> and domain  <dig> were made in accordance with morinaga et al  , and domain  <dig> was produced with amino acid positions 357- <dig>  <cit> . the n-terminal of recombinant d1-afp and d2-afp contain an extra  <dig> amino acid peptide  while d3-afp contains additional  <dig> amino acids . to aid the purification process, all recombinant proteins also have 6xhis tag in their c-terminal ends . d-afps were successfully expressed by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction as confirmed by sds-page and western blot using anti-his antibody . they were successfully purified by ni-nta column .

impact of the domains on mddc maturation in vitro
as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  freshly isolated monocytes from human pbmc  were cd14+. after stimulation with gm-csf, il- <dig> and lps, a high expression level of cd <dig>   was seen, showing that mddc was successfully derived from blood monocytes. at the same time, up-regulation of hla-dr and cd11c as well as loss of cd <dig> molecules were also observed at day  <dig> .

addition of afp has previously been shown to induce apoptosis of mmdc  <cit> . we added a range of afp concentration between  <dig>  μg/ml to  <dig> μg/ml and observed that mmdc cells start to die at fl-afp concentration >  <dig>  μg/ml . we thus chose the  <dig>  μg/ml  as the working concentration for most of the subsequent experiments. when afp at concentration  <dig>  μg/ml was added to the monocytes culture , a reduction of the mean expression level of cd <dig> was observed . the same effect was seen for cd <dig> . the afp immunoregulatory activity is dose-dependent as less suppression was seen at lower afp concentrations . when individual afp domain proteins were added at  <dig>  μm, d1-afp exhibited little suppressive effect on cd <dig> . in contrast, d2-afp and d3-afp showed the same suppressive activities as the full-length afp protein . we concluded that d2-afp and d3-afp could significantly block the maturation process of mddc.

impact of the domains on mddc function in vitro
hla-dr and cd11c were then used for further mddc characterization. in the presence of  <dig>  μm d2-afp or d3-afp, mddc culture failed to up-regulate hla-dr. in contrast,  <dig>  μm d1-afp treated mddc culture showed high level of hla-dr expression. the effect of d2-afp and d3-afp on the expression of hla-drhigh was similar to the fl-afp molecules . consistent with the hla-dr results, expression of cd11c molecule was suppressed at day  <dig> by full-length afp . the expression of hla-drhigh/cd11chigh was found to be repressed by d2-afp  and d3-afp  at day  <dig> . this indicated that both d2-afp and d3-afp showed a similar suppressive effect to the expression of hla-drhigh/cd11chigh as the full-length afp molecules.

in the absence of afp or domains, cd <dig> was highly expressed after lps induction  as shown in figure  <dig>  in contrast, addition of  <dig>  μm afp repressed the ability of mddc to express cd <dig> as shown in table  <dig>  at day  <dig> . in the presence of  <dig>  μm d2-afp or d3-afp, cd <dig> expression was altered when compared to non-treated group. however, it was shown that number of cd40+/cd83+ cells was reduced by d2-afp and d3-afp but not d1-afp . we concluded that the expression of cd40+ and cd83+ on mddc was suppressed when the d2-afp or d3-afp was present.

as shown in figure 2d, after lps induction, expression of cd80+/cd86high was significantly inhibited by  <dig>  μm d2-afp  or d3-afp  in a similar effect to the full-length afp protein . in combination with hla-drhigh expression, we concluded that the presence of d2-afp or d3-afp is likely to block the ability of mddc to present antigens. we found that there was no significant difference in the expression of cd80+/cd86high when d1-afp is present during mddc maturation.

effect of fl-afp or d-afp on il- <dig> secretion
level of cytokine il- <dig>  in supernatant of each mddc culture was measured using elisa at day  <dig>  and after  <dig> hrs stimulation with lps . before lps stimulation, there was very low il- <dig> produced by both non-treated and treated group . after  <dig> hrs of lps stimulation, a significant increase of il- <dig> production was detected in the non-treated group but not in the groups treated by fl-afp or any of the d-afp samples. these results suggested that both fl-afp and d-afp can impair the ability of mddc to produce il- <dig> .

discussion
we investigated the effects of afp domains on mddc biology in vitro. the study was started by evaluating the effects of afp full length  on the viability of mddc generated from healthy individuals. using the e. coli system and purification procedure as previously reported  <cit> , we could produce the domains of afp in e. coli. in this study, we have delineated the afp domains that execute the suppressive effect to mddc maturation. furthermore, we were interested to see whether after maturation, the mddc can still function in the presence of the afp domains. for antigen presentation, the engagement of the t-cell receptor by peptide/mhc complexes  is not sufficient to trigger a t cell response, and that ligation of a co-stimulatory receptor  is required for t cell activation  <cit> . in addition, cd <dig> is also necessary for dc activation  <cit> . binding cd <dig> with cd <dig> ligand will trigger downstream functions of dc such as cytokine secretion. we divided the mddc functions into the ability to present the antigen and to secrete the cytokine by monitoring the expression of cd14+, cd83+, hla-drhigh/cd11chigh, cd40+/cd83+, cd80+/cd86high and il- <dig> as shown in table  <dig> and  <dig> 

differentiation of monocytes into mddc was monitored by the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> molecule. during mddc maturation, cd <dig> decreases and conversely, cd <dig> rapidly increases after addition of lps. the presence of afp molecule at the concentration  <dig>  μg/ml  resulted in reduction of cd <dig> expression. our results showed that the d2-afp and d3-afp retained the suppression effect on cd <dig> appearance. the suppression effect of d2-afp and d3-afp was found to be similar to fl-afp during the maturation process. as mddc maturation was repressed, we predict that the function of mddc would also be suppressed if we added the d2-afp and d3-afp.

as shown in table  <dig>  cells that expressed hla-drhigh/cd11chigh, cd40+/cd83+, and cd80+/cd86high were significantly lower in the presence of d2-afp and d3-afp but comparable to the afp molecules. this finding suggests that these two domains contain the suppression function to mddc maturation and that d2-afp or d3-afp potentially could be used for further study to unravel the role of afp in the immune system.

secretion il- <dig> in the form of the biologically active p <dig> molecule could be considered to be one of the most important functions of dcs. il-12p <dig> produced by dcs can polarize t cell responses towards cd4+ t helper  <dig> cells . th <dig> cells can support development of cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes and in turn, can foster an appropriate adaptive immune response to eliminate malignant cells  <cit> . it has been reported that lps from e. coli could induce mddc to produce il-12p <dig>  <cit> . however in the presence of the full-length afp or afp domains, the production was blocked. these data suggest a differential function of afp domains in mddc maturation and cytokine secretion.

afp is a glycoprotein protein. the recombinant afp fragments used in our study were expressed in e. coli, which does not have a glycosylation system. it is interesting to note that they were still functional in regulating mddc function similarly to the full-length afp derived from purified human cord blood serum, which presumably are glycosylated. these results indicated that glycosylation of afp seems to be unnecessary in their immunoregulatory function. our result was also supported by a study on the effect of glycosylation on afp foldability and conformational structure performed by others  <cit> . using reversed-phase column hplc to analyze two afp variants: glycosylated cord blood-derived afp and non-glycosylated recombinant afp purified from transgenic goat milk, they showed that glycosylation is not required for proper protein folding of the human afp recombinant proteins. they presumed that this is due to the presence of only one single glycosylation site in human afp  <cit>  and glycosylation does not have a significant impact on the hydrophobicity or disulfide conformation of the molecule.

it has been reported that dc can be transfected or pulsed with antigens to enhance cytotoxic lymphocyte  responses  <cit> . in the context of dc-based immunotherapy, afp has been considered as a candidate antigen to elicit effective tumor rejection  <cit>  but its suppressive activities on dc function have precluded its implementation. our results indicated that individual afp domains have differential effects on mddc maturation and function with d1-afp having the least suppressive activities. d1-afp can thus potentially be used as an antigen to pulse mddc to enhance ctl response against afp. however, further investigations in vitro and in vivo are still needed to test this idea.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the afp domains indeed have differential immunoregulatory function. in the context of mddc maturation process, d2-afp and d3-afp have similar suppressive function as the full-length afp molecule. as d1-afp has no effect on dc function, it is a prime candidate for use in a dc-based immunotherapy.
