BACKGROUND
transcription factors  play a central role in many critical biological processes, such as transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, development, and apoptosis. during signal transduction, the extra- or intra-cellular signals are conveyed eventually to certain transcription factors, leading to their activation or repression and consequently changing the expression of their target genes. thus, the identification of transcription factors associated with a biological process is fundamental to understanding its regulatory mechanism.

dna microarray technology has been widely applied to functional genomic studies, in which mrna expression levels for thousands of genes are measured simultaneously. in a typical experimental design, gene expressions are measured for a collection of samples from two classes, e.g. tumor versus normal tissues. after appropriate processing of microarray data, we can obtain the mrna expression change of every gene between the two classes. for transcription factors, however, it is often difficult to infer their activity changes based only on their own mrna expression levels for the following reasons:  the mrna expression levels of many tfs are often relatively low compared to other genes;  the activities of tfs are prevalently regulated by post-transcriptional modifications, e.g. protein phosphorylation, which cannot be captured by gene expression microarrays;  other complications in regulation may also exist.

to overcome these challenges, several approaches have been proposed in the literature to infer tf activities through expression changes of their regulated target genes. these approaches can roughly be divided into two classes according to the type of binding affinity data used for inference. the first class, including reduce  <cit>  and motif regressor  <cit> , identify regulatory motifs  associated with gene expression changes. the second class make use of the chip-chip data, which provide direct experimental binding information of tfs with genomic sequences  <cit> . this class includes the network component analysis  introduced by liao et al.  <cit> , the pseudo-inverse projection method described by alter et al.  <cit> , the ma-networker algorithm proposed by gao et al.  <cit> , and the partial least squares  regression method suggested by boulesteix et al.  <cit> . common to these approaches, a linear relationship between gene expression changes and tf-gene binding affinities is assumed. the two motif-based methods, reduce and motif regressor, also assume a linear relationship between expression changes and motif occurrences  or motif matching-scores  in the upstream regions of genes. unfortunately, the linear relationship may not be valid considering the high complexity of gene transcription regulation. tsai et al. proposed a statistical method to identify cell cycle associated tfs in yeast, which used the kolmogorov-smirnov  test to examine whether expressions of the target and non-target gene sets of a tf are significantly different  <cit> . this method does not assume a linear relationship between gene expression changes and tf-gene binding affinities, whereas a threshold value, which is more or less arbitrarily selected, must be specified to determine the target and non-target gene sets for a tf.

in this article, we propose a new method, referred to as base , to infer tf activity changes by integrating microarray expression data with binding affinity data such as chip-chip data or motif data. the basic idea of the method is illustrated in figure  <dig>  in general, activity change of a tf can be reflected by expression changes of its target genes in the microarray data. given a sorted expression change profile, we would observe different binding affinity patterns for tfs with enhanced, reduced, or unchanged activities as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  it should be noted that the association between tf-gene binding affinities and target gene expression changes may exist only in a local region  rather than across all genes. this local association is difficult to be detected by standard linear methods. in contrast, base is designed to detect the local association between tf-gene binding affinities and gene expression changes to increase the power of transcriptional inference. we illustrate the method by three case studies using different types of binding affinity scores: chip-chip data, motif discovery data, and positional weighted matrix  scanning data. in these data sets, our methods achieve results that are biologically meaningful and consistent with previous studies.

RESULTS
we demonstrate the ability of our method to provide biological meaningful insights using three examples for which considerable background information is available. for the first example, we combine chip-chip data with microarray data from transcription factor perturbation experiments  that measure gene expression changes in tf-deleted or tf-overexpressed yeast strains with respect to the wild-type. for the second example, we integrate gene expression data with motif discovery data to identify transcription factors that may account for the life span extension in three long-lived yeast mutants. for the third example, gene expression data is integrated with the positional weight matrices  information to detect transcription factors that are activated or repressed in three subtypes of human lung tumors.

tf activity changes in tfpe microarray data
we collect  <dig> microarray gene expression profiles from previous tfpe in yeast, including  <dig> deletions and  <dig> over-expressions of transcription factor  <cit> . we combine these  <dig> microarray gene expression profiles with chip-chip data to identify the activated or repressed tfs in these tfpes. the chip-chip data is from the systematic experiments performed by harbison et al.  <cit> , where genomic occupancies of  <dig> yeast tfs in ypd medium were measured. for some of these tfs, genomic occupancies in several other environmental conditions were also determined, such as heat shock and rapamycin treatment. we calculate the activity change scores  as well as their significances  for each combination of the  <dig> gene expression change profiles and the  <dig> chip-chip profiles .

since chip-chip experiments are carried out for all the  <dig> tfs only in the ypd medium, our inference first focuses on the chip-chip data under this condition. our results show that in  <dig> out of  <dig> tf deletion and  <dig> out of  <dig> tf over-expression tfpes, the known perturbed tfs are found to be substantially activated or repressed at the  <dig>  significance level . it should be noted that deletion or over-expression of a tf may not always cause expression changes of its target genes  <cit> . first, different tfs often form a certain complex to regulate transcription and thereby over-expression or removal of a single component of the complex may not lead to apparent expression changes of its target genes. second, if the activity of a tf in the wild-type is inherently high/low, over-expression/deletion of the tf may not substantially change its target gene expression. finally, many confounding factors such as function redundancy and post-translational modifications may exist.

regardless of the complications, when a tf is deleted, by and large we would expect down-regulation of the target genes if it is a transcriptional activator, or up-regulation of the target genes if it is a transcriptional repressor. conversely, when a tf is over-expressed, we would expect to observe the opposite expression changes of its target genes. among these perturbed tfs in the tfpes, the majority are transcriptional activators and only  <dig>  function as transcriptional repressors according to previous studies  <cit> . the activity inferences of these  <dig> repressors are consistent with what are expected: the ac scores for hir <dig> in hir2Δ and mbp <dig> in mbp1Δ are  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively, suggesting the up-regulation of their target genes; whereas in their over-expressed strains the ac scores for bye <dig>  gzf <dig>  mbp <dig> and rox <dig> are - <dig>  , - <dig>  , - <dig>   and - <dig>  , respectively, suggesting the down-regulation of their target genes. for the remaining perturbed tfs which are known as transcription activators, the inferred activity changes of them are also consistent with our expectations , but with a few exceptions. these exceptions may imply more delicate mechanism regarding tf activity regulation. for example, rather than a positive value, the ac score of met <dig>  is - <dig>   in its over-expressed strain. this inconsistency may reflect the difference of met <dig> at expression and activity levels, since it has been reported that met <dig> controls its own degradation through a negative feed back loop  <cit> . alternatively, these exceptions may also be caused by incomplete tf functional annotation or by the difference in experimental conditions between the micorarray and chip-chip experiments. it is possible that for some tfs, the tf-gene binding affinities in the chip-chip data do not match the true regulatory relationship under the microarray experiment condition.

in addition, our results indicate that deletion or over-expression of a tf can lead to activity change of some other tfs, suggesting either regulatory relationships between these tfs or a significant overlapping of their target genes. for example, there are  <dig> and  <dig> other tfs that are significantly changed in activity in mbp1Δ and gcn4Δ, respectively. further investigation of these regulatory relationships may be helpful to understand the tf-tf interaction during transcriptional regulation.

we next examine the inferred tf activity changes based on the chip-chip data under all the available conditions: ypd , h2o2hi , h2o2lo , sm , acid , rapa  and but <dig> . it turns out that for some tfs, when the chip-chip data under different conditions are used, the inferred activity changes in a given microarray experiment can vary substantially. let us use yap <dig> in yap7Δ as the example: based on chip-chip data from ypd medium, the inferred ac score is - <dig>  ; while based on chip-chip data from h2o2hi treatment, the inferred ac score is  <dig>  . this conflict results from the dynamic nature of association between tfs and genes.

according to the chip-chip experiments, some tfs including yap <dig> may associate with a different set of genes under different cell status, medium, or other conditions  <cit> . further computation shows no significant correlation between the binding profiles of yap <dig> under the ypd and h2o2hi conditions: the spearman correlation coefficient is  <dig> . therefore, when combining microarray data with chip-chip data to infer tf activities, we should be cautious of the conditions under which the microarray and chip-chip experiments are performed. if the two experiments are performed under the same or similar conditions, the activity change inferences are reliable. otherwise, the inferences are reliable only for those tfs that bind to invariant sets of genes under different conditions.

both deletion and over-expression tfpe data are available for  <dig> tfs: gcn <dig>  hsf <dig>  mbp <dig>  ste <dig>  swi <dig> and yap <dig>  so we examine the consistency of activity inferences for these tfs in the deletion and over-expression tfpes. as shown in figure  <dig>  in all except two cases, our method achieves consistent results for tf activity inference. for example, gcn <dig>  the transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes, is inferred to be activated in gcn <dig> over-expressed yeast strain  and repressed in gcn4Δ strain . moreover, over-expressed tfpes for msn <dig>  msn <dig>  and yap <dig> have been performed independently by two research groups  <cit> . we examine consistency of the activity inferences from both data sets. as shown in figure  <dig>  our method achieves similar results for the two independent microarray expression data sets. it should be noted that expression profiles from the two yap <dig> over-expression microarray experiments are not significantly similar with each other , perhaps due to high noise introduced during microarray experiments. nevertheless, the transcriptional inferences for yap <dig> from both data sets are still in good consistency, suggesting the robustness of our method to noise in gene expression data.

we also apply the method proposed by tsai et al.  <cit>  to these  <dig> tfpe microarray profiles. based on the chip-chip data, a target gene set  and a non-target gene set  are defined for each tf, and expressions of genes in these sets are compared using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. as shown in additional file  <dig> and file  <dig>  this method detects activity changes of  <dig> tfs from their tfpes , all of which are identified by our method. this suggests that our method is more sensitive, since the base method examines the maximum local association between the expression change profile and the tf-gene binding affinity profile. according to our observations, mostly the association between these profiles only exists at the two end regions in the sorted expression change profile . it is hard to detect these local associations if we examine correlations across all genes, as the linear regression based methods do. in fact, for each of the  <dig> tfpes, we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between its expression change profile and its binding affinity profile of the corresponding tf and it turns out that only  <dig> tfpes have a correlation greater than  <dig> .

tf activity changes in long-lived yeast mutants
recent studies suggest that three nutrient responsive kinases: sch <dig>  pka, and tor, may play important roles in yeast ageing. for example, inactivation of sch <dig> kinase increases the replicative life span  by 30–40%  <cit>  and extends the chronological life span  by nearly three fold  <cit> . to understand the mechanism of ageing, we generate three long-lived yeast mutants: sch9Δ, ras2Δ and tor1Δ, in which sch <dig>  pka, and tor kinase are inactivated, respectively. although the mechanisms of longevity in these mutants have not been fully understood, two stress response transcription factors, msn2/ <dig> and gis <dig>  are likely to be involved since deletion of msn2/ <dig> in ras2Δ and deletion of rim <dig>  a kinase that activates gis <dig> in sch9Δ reverse the survival extension  <cit> . we measure the gene expressions of the three mutants and a wild-type yeast strain using microarrays and obtain three expression change profiles: sch9Δ/wt, ras2Δ/wt and tor1Δ/wt.

in what follows, we apply the base method to identify the tfs associated with longevity in these mutants by integrating microarray data with motif discovery data. first,  <dig> putative regulatory motifs are identified from the promoter regions of all yeast genes using alignace, a de novo motif discovery method  <cit> . we then scan the promoter region of each gene to examine their occurrences. for each of the  <dig> putative motifs, we end up with a matching-score vector, which measures the transcriptional potentials of the binding motif for genes. finally, the matching-score vectors are combined with the expression change profiles  to identify the regulatory motifs associated with gene expression modification in the mutants.

the results of our computational inference indicate that the activities of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> motifs are significantly changed in sch9Δ/wt, ras2Δ/wt, and tor1Δ/wt, respectively . among these  <dig> motifs,  <dig> can be associated with transcription factors according to literature and databases  <cit> . table  <dig> shows  <dig> motifs of these  <dig> motifs, which have significant activity changes in at least one of the three long-lived mutants. as shown in the table, both msn2/ <dig> and gis <dig> are found to be significantly activated in all three long-lived mutants. although the experimental justifications are only available for msn2/ <dig> in ras2Δ and for kim <dig>  in sch9Δ  <cit> , our results suggest that in all three mutants, msn2/ <dig> and gis <dig> may play a critical regulatory role in life span extension. consistently, some studies have shown the negative regulation of msn2/ <dig> activity by pka and tor kinase as well as the negative regulation of gis <dig> activity by pka kinase  <cit> . in addition to msn2/ <dig> and gis <dig>  we identify other tfs with significant activity changes, such as fhl <dig>  sum1/ndt <dig> and pho <dig>  which may also be critical for life span extension and further investigations may shed new light on the mechanism of longevity in these long-lived yeast mutants.

the  <dig> motifs that can be associated with a known tf and are significant in at least one of the three long-lived mutants are shown.

in a previous study, we identified motifs associated with life span extension in sch9Δ, ras2Δ, and tor1Δ using a cut-off based method  <cit> . this method applied the fisher's exact test to examine the enrichment of each motif in the up- and down-regulated gene sets from sch9Δ/wt, ras2Δ/wt, and tor1Δ/wt. although the selection of cutoff is generally not trivial, in this case the cut-off based method and the base method achieve similar results. for example, both msn2/ <dig> and gis <dig> binding motifs are found to be significantly activated or enriched in the up-regulated gene sets in all three long-lived mutants with respect to the wild-type. in addition, we tried the linear regression based method, motif regressor, which did not identify msn2/ <dig> and gis <dig> as activity changed tfs in these long-lived mutants. in fact, no significant linear relationship between gene expression changes in sch9Δ/wt, ras2Δ/wt, and tor1Δ/wt and the motif matching scores of msn2/ <dig> or gis <dig> is revealed from scatter plots and their correlation coefficients.

tf activity changes in lung carcinomas
in the third case, we apply our method to study the transcriptional regulation in tumors. we seek to identify tfs that have significantly different activities in small cell lung carcinomas , squamous cell lung carcinomas  and pulmonary carcinoids  with respect to normal lung tissues. we use the microarray data set provided by bhattacharjee et al.  <cit> , which includes gene expression profiles in specimens from smc, sq, coid and normal tissues. we calculate the t-statistic for each gene, which summarizes the difference of gene expression in smc, sq or coid with respect to normal lung tissues. in the mean time, we extract all available pwms from transfac  <cit>  and use the match program  <cit>  to calculate their matching-scores in the promoter regions of all human genes. to apply our method, the t-scores are taken as the gene expression change data and the matching-scores are taken as the binding affinity data. we identify all pwms that are significantly associated with the expression differentiation profiles of lung tumors with respect to normal lung tissues. these pwms and their associated tfs may reflect the differences in transcriptional regulation between lung tumors and normal lung tissues and thus provide us with biological insights about carcinogenesis.

only the pwms that are significant  in all the three tumor subtypes are shown.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a novel method to infer activity changes of transcription factor by integrating the gene expression data with binding affinity data such as chip-chip or motif data. unlike previous approaches, this method does not assume linear relationship between tf-gene binding affinities and gene expression changes. since this method does not need pre-defined target gene sets, it requires no threshold selection for binding affinity scores or gene expression changes. this method is applied to three different data sets in which the gene expression data are integrated with chip-chip data, motif discovery data and motif scanning data, respectively. the implications obtained from each data set are biologically meaningful and consistent with previous studies. moreover, the method is robust to noise in expression data and easy to be implemented. potentially, this method may be applied to many microarray data sets to shed light on the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.
