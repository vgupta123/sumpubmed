BACKGROUND
asian seabass , also called barramundi in australia, is an important farmed marine foodfish species which has been cultured for more than  <dig> years in southeast asian countries  <cit> . current global annual production is nearly  <dig>  mt according to fao statistics in  <dig>  and over 90% of which originated from taiwan, hong kong, singapore and thailand  <cit> . australia is also presently becoming a major producer. the production of this species is expected to expand more rapidly in the next few years due to high market demand. studies using allozyme and mtdna polymorphism showed genetic diversity of the asian seabass in australia was low and genetic differentiation among fish from different regions was large  <cit> , while studies using polymorphic microsatellites showed that both cultured and wild stocks of asian seabass in southeast asia contained high allelic and gene diversity  <cit> . no detailed selective breeding program has yet been reported.

growth-related traits such as body weight, total length, standard length and condition factor are quantitative traits influenced by a number of genes with relatively small effects, and environmental effects. these traits could be improved by phenotypic selection, but the genetic gain can be increased more rapidly with marker-assisted selection  <cit> . genome scans using molecular markers have proved to be effective in the detection of qtl in organisms such as livestock species in experimental populations created by crossing genetically diverse strains  <cit> . studies on linkage and qtl mapping in foodfish species started later than those in economically important livestock  <cit> . to date, linkage maps have been constructed for only  <dig> foodfish species including rainbow trout  <cit> , salmon  <cit> , tilapia  <cit> , catfish  <cit> , yellowtail  <cit> , and common carp <cit> .

the genetic and molecular basis of growth-related traits is poorly understood in fish. genetic studies in fish species have been limited by cost and the difficulty of raising large numbers of fish under the same conditions and the lack of linkage maps. a few qtl for growth-related traits, disease resistance and stress resistance have been detected in experimental f <dig> or backcross populations of some foodfish species, such as rainbow trout  <cit> , salmon  <cit>  and tilapia  <cit> . qtl analysis in f <dig> full-sib families from breeding stocks has not been reported in any fish species, although methods for detecting qtl with f <dig> populations in outbreed species have been developed  <cit> , and have been successfully applied to identify qtl in several plant species  <cit> .

recently, we established a first generation genetic linkage map of asian seabass using  <dig> microsatellite markers covering  <dig> linkage groups with marker interval of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm in the female and male maps respectively  <cit> , thus providing a necessary tool for a whole genome scan for qtl affecting economically important traits. in a previous study, we demonstrated that body weight at  <dig> day post-hatch  was significantly correlated with body weight at harvest  in asian seabass  <cit> . in an association study, we detected significant association between grow-traits and polymorphism in one parvalbumin gene   <cit> . in the present study, we conducted a genome scan for qtl affecting body weight, total length, standard length and condition factors at  <dig> dph in an f <dig> family containing  <dig> individuals from a breeding population. the objectives of this study are: 1) to test whether an f <dig> family from a breeding stock can be used for detecting qtl affecting growth-related traits, 2) to locate qtl on linkage groups, 3) to estimate effects of qtl and finally, 4) to understand qtl allele substitution effects. this study is an initial step towards the goal of marker-assisted selection in asian seabass.

RESULTS
trait values
the phenotypic values of growth-related traits in the f <dig> family at  <dig> dph are presented in table  <dig>  the average body weight of the  <dig> f <dig> individuals was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g. total lengths  of these fish ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, whereas the standard lengths  were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm . the average condition factors  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  calculated according to tl and sl respectively .

linkage map
the  <dig> microsatellite markers selected were mapped into  <dig> linkage groups with a map length of  <dig>  cm.  <dig> of the  <dig> linkage groups were covered with at least two markers . the markers were well-dispersed throughout the genome, and the average distance between markers was  <dig>  cm.

qtl mapping
qtl affecting body weight, total length and standard length were identified on a genome-wide scale. the genome-wide lod significance thresholds were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for body weight, total length and standard length, respectively, while the linkage-group-wide lod significance thresholds varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . five significant  and  <dig> suggestive  qtl were detected by the whole genome scan . multiple qtl model  mapping with initial qtl did not change the results.

three significant qtl  controlling body weight, total length and standard length, were detected on the same region near the microsatellite marker lca <dig> on lg <dig>  and explained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the observed phenotypic variance, respectively . the fourth significant qtl affecting body weight was detected near lca <dig> on lg <dig>  this qtl accounted for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. the fifth significant qtl  affecting body weight was located near lca <dig> on lg <dig>  and explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance.

the  <dig> suggestive qtl affecting growth-related traits were located on ten linkage groups  . three suggestive qtl for body weight  were detected on lg <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these qtl explained relatively low phenotypic variance. six suggestive qtl for standard and total length were detected on lg <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in the regions of lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lca <dig> and lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lca <dig> on lg <dig>  lcae <dig> on lg <dig>  and lca <dig> on lg <dig> as well, qtl controlling more than one growth-related traits were detected.

suggestive qtl associated with the condition factors were located on six different lgs . some suggestive qtl for ktl and ksl , were located on the same locations of lg <dig>  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, but some  were mapped on different locations.

effects of qtl allele substitution
a two-way anova was performed on the  <dig> progeny using four allelic combinations  from markers nearest to the five significant qtl in order to investigate associations between phenotypic traits and genotypes. the phenotype values of each allelic combination are listed in table  <dig>  out of the five significant qtl, progeny with only one m2f <dig> genotype at any of the four qtl, qbw2-a, qtl2-a, qsl2-a and qbw <dig>  showed higher phenotype values than those without m2f <dig>  while individuals with genotype m2f <dig> at qtl qbw2-b displayed heavier body weight than individuals without this genotype . at the extreme, a difference of  <dig>  g in bw were observed between individuals with genotypes m2f <dig> and m1f <dig> at the qtl qbw2-a. similarly, difference in total length between individuals with genotypes m2f <dig> and m1f <dig> at qtl qtl2-a was  <dig>  mm . by using a single marker nearest to every suggestive and significant qtl, the effects of alleles within paternal and maternal parents and their interactions were further analyzed . among the five significant qtl, qbw2-a, qbw2-b, qtl2-a and qsl2-a showed significant effects within both the male and female alleles, and qbw <dig> showed significant effects within female alleles only. at suggestive qtl, qtl allele substitution effects were also observed .

discussion
linkage mapping
as expected, the selected  <dig> microsatellites were mapped into  <dig> linkage groups. for the majority of lgs, three or more markers were mapped. marker order in every lg were almost identical to that in our published linkage map  <cit> . the total map length was  <dig>  cm, quite similar to the average length of male and female maps we published  <cit> . the average marker interval was  <dig>  cm, smaller than the required minimum of 10– <dig> cm for qtl mapping  <cit> . therefore, this linkage map is suitable for a preliminary genome-wide scan for qtl on growth-related traits.

qtl mapping
accurate qtl analyses have been developed in recent years to detect and estimate qtl effects on economically important livestock and plant species  <cit> . in most studies employing qtl mapping, two generations of mapping populations were created by crossing genetically different lines or strains, followed by producing second generation progeny from mating f <dig> males and females or back-crossing f <dig> progeny to its parents in order to increase the power for qtl detection  <cit> . however, for species such as cattle, trees and most marine fish species, long generation interval meant that creating f <dig> generations or backcross families will take a long time, and therefore, is not easily feasible in practice. methods for detection of qtl in f <dig>  families were developed  <cit>  and successfully applied to plants  <cit> , cattle  <cit>  and sheep  <cit> . the power to detect qtl depends on heritability of traits, average allelic substitution effect of the alleles involved, recombination distance between the qtl and associated markers, and sample size of the progeny  <cit> . in most marine fish species, as in the asian seabass, which are broadcast spawners with a long generation interval , they are prolific spawners and are highly fecund. furthermore, most cultured marine foodfish are progeny of wild-collected brooders having not been selected for any traits, as such, possess high levels of genetic variation. hence, marine foodfish would be ideal for testing qtl analyses in f <dig> full-sib families. in this study we conducted a genome scan for qtl for growth-related traits in an f <dig> family including  <dig> individuals from a breeding stock. five significant and  <dig> suggestive qtl were detected on the genome. our study represents the first example of detecting qtl for growth-related traits by using a single f <dig> family with large number of offspring on the whole genome in marine foodfish. however, using of an f <dig> full-sib family from a breeding population for qtl analysis has its limitation. the power of such qtl analysis is limited. only the qtl that are segregating in one or both parents can be detected. the detected qtl may not be representative for the genetic architecture of growth of asian seabass. thus, the detected qtl should be verified in other asian seabass families before they are used in selective breeding.

significant and suggestive qtl for body weight were detected in five lgs in this study, while in rainbow trout, qtl for body weight were detected in seven different lgs using a genome-scan  <cit> . the proportion of variance explained by the significant qtl for body weight varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in this study, which is similar to the 11–25% that was found in trout  <cit> . among the significant qtl detected in this study, qbw2-a, qtl2-a and qsl2-a located on lg <dig>  explained high percentages of the observed phenotypic variance, indicating that growth-related traits of asian seabass might be controlled by a few qtl with large effects, together with some qtl with minor effects. our results in this vertebrate system are consistent with a number of genetic studies in plants and insects suggesting that a large proportion of quantitative variation can be explained by the segregation of a few major qtl  <cit> .

at some chromosomal regions, qtl controlling more than one growth-related traits were detected, suggesting either the linkage of two or more qtl , or the presences of a single qtl on each lg with pleiotropic effects. however, distinguishing between a single gene versus a gene cluster with individual qtl proved to be difficult, given the current marker density in the first generation linkage map <cit> . more markers are needed to identify the full spectrum of genetic changes, which contribute to growth differences and to narrow down the location of a gene or genes within each chromosome interval with contribution to growth divergence. isolation of additional microsatellites, snps, and microsatellites in ests and genes are still underway, to allow for the construction of a high resolution linkage map for fine mapping of qtl and gene of interest.

suggestive qtl for condition  factors were located on six lgs, and their effects were relatively small. in rainbow trout, only a qtl for k factor was mapped in one lg  <cit> , whereas in salmon four significant qtl for k factor were mapped to four lgs  <cit> . in asian seabass, some qtl for the traits ktl and ksl were located on the same positions, while others were located in different places, suggesting that the two k factors are controlled by some genes in common and some different genes with small effects. since the qtl were detected in only an f <dig> full-sib family and the effects of these qtl are small, confirmation in other families is required.

we have noticed that the total pve of six significant and suggestive qtl for the trait standard length was almost 100%, which is theoretically impossible. however in practice, similar results have been reported in previous qtl analyses. for example, in the three published papers  <cit>  on qtl mapping in fish, the total pve of qtl for a certain trait was over 100%. there might be several reasons for this phenomenon. firstly, interaction among qtl was not included in qtl analysis due to the limitation of the software. if the correlation between qtl is large, they share a certain amount of variation and are not completely independent. secondly, the proportion of the variation explained by these qtl is likely an overestimate due to the beavis effect  <cit> . more makers on the linkage map, larger population size and more improved statistic models to detect qtl interactions are expected to solve this problem.

a two-way anova revealed that allelic substitution at the microsatellite markers located near the five significant qtl showed large effects on growth-related traits. certain allelic combinations showed significantly improved performances of the traits analyzed. the genotypes at these marker loci may be useful for growth improvement through maker-assisted selection in this family. at four of the five significant qtl, both alleles from the father and the mother showed significant effects, suggesting that qtl alleles of both parents are segregating. whereas, at one significant qtl , alleles from the father showed significant effects, but alleles from mother did not show effects, indicating the segregation of qtl alleles of the father, and fixation of qtl alleles from the mother. qtl allele substitution effects were also seen at suggestive qtl, suggesting the segregation of qtl alleles in both parents or one of the two parents.

candidate gene approaches have been used for identification of qtl  <cit> . in a previous study, we demonstrated that the polymorphism in the gene pvalb <dig> located on lg <dig> was significantly associated with traits body weight and length in asian seabass  <cit> . however, this gene was not polymorphic in the full-sib family for qtl analysis, and no significant qtl for traits was detected on lg <dig>  another potential candidate gene is the growth hormone  gene, which was mapped near the microsatellite marker lca <dig> on the lg <dig> in the first generation linkage map of asian seabass  <cit> . this gene plays an important role in the growth of organisms. previous studies in pig, chicken and cattle indicated that polymorphisms in the gh gene were associated with growth-related traits and other economically important traits  <cit> . unfortunately, the microsatellite marker lca <dig> located in the promotor of the gh gene was not informative in our mapping family. a significant qtl affecting body weight, explaining  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance was mapped on lg <dig>  but the position was about  <dig>  cm away from the gh gene, suggesting the gh gene is not associated with growth-related traits in this family. to examine the effects of the gh and pvalb <dig> genes on economically important traits, more polymorphisms in these two genes will be detected.

CONCLUSIONS
we detected five significant and  <dig> suggestive qtl for growth-related traits in an f <dig> family from a breeding stock of asian seabass. this study presents the first example of qtl detection in an f <dig> family of a marine foodfish. the results presented will enable fine-mapping of the identified qtl for marker-assisted selection and eventually identifying individual genes responsible for these traits for direct selection
