BACKGROUND
rhabdomyosarcoma  is a malignant tumour derived from primitive rhabdomyeloblasts with differentiation towards skeletal muscle  <cit> . rms makes up more than half of the soft tissue sarcomas in children, and accounts for 5-8% of all childhood malignancies  <cit> . combination chemotherapy, following surgery, involving drugs which inhibit mitotic spindle function, poison topoisomerase ii, inhibit transcription, and alkylate dna, has resulted in five-year survival rates of about 65% for patients with localised rms tumours  <cit> . however, the presence of metastatic or disseminated disease, or a diagnosis of the alveolar rms subtype, confers a worse prognosis  <cit> , with tumours often refractory to established chemotherapy. clearly, new agents are a priority, especially for the 30-40% of paediatric patients with these malignancies who do not achieve full remission, or who relapse following therapy.

recently, we have shown that the acridine-4-carboxamide derivative as-daca , elicits a marked differential response in several commonly studied rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines  <cit> . as-daca is potently cytotoxic in the rms-derived cell line rh <dig>  but is 190-fold less active in the rd cell line  <cit> . in this work we begin an investigation into the basis for this preferential activity between these two cell lines. as- daca is the 9-amino-5-methylsulphone derivative of the clinical candidate daca  <cit> , it has good solid tumour activity in animal models  <cit> , intercalates into dna as a lipohilic monocation at physiological ph with its charged n,n-dimethylethylamino side chain binding to guanine  <cit> , and poisons topoisomerase ii  <cit> . it has the unusual property amongst the acridine-4-carboxamide cytotoxins that its acridine chromophore is weakly basic with a pk of  <dig>   <cit> , so that at ph  <dig>  it is a monocation, but as the ph is lowered towards  <dig> and below, it becomes doubly charged. this has consequences for its fluorescence properties, which become ph-dependent, and may affect its intracellular distribution and pharmacology.

here we use the fluorescence properties of as-daca to permit direct visualization of its intracellular distribution. a novel situation is therefore created whereby the cytotoxic agent itself reveals the ph of the organelle in which it is localized. our results show that as-daca not only accumulates in the nucleus, as expected, but also in acidic intracellular vesicles in rms cells. however, we find that the membrane trafficking system differs between the two rms subtypes, with the early endosome markers, rab <dig> and eea <dig>  expressed to a lesser degree in the sensitive rh <dig> cell line compared to the resistant rd cell line. generation of an as-daca-resistant rh <dig> subline resulted in an increase in expression of the early endosome markers, rab <dig> and eea <dig>  suggesting that the membrane trafficking system plays a significant role in the determination of as- daca sensitivity. in addition, we show that cytotoxic sensitivity to as-daca correlates with the induction of dna double strand breaks, but is un-perturbed by the inhibition of the multidrug-resistance associated protein mrp <dig>  lastly, we demonstrate that fluorescence microscopy can be used to examine the intracellular distribution of as- daca into both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of rms cells grown as spheroids, where penetrance is much greater in rh <dig> than rd spheroids, and that the vesicular signal leads the way into the spheroid mass.

RESULTS
in previous work we showed that the ic <dig> for as-daca in rd cells is  <dig> ±  <dig> nm whereas in rh <dig> cells it is  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm, indicating a 190-fold difference in sensitivity   <cit> . to help understand the reasons for the sensitivity difference between these erms and the arms cell lines, we developed an as-daca-resistant sub-line of rh <dig> cells. results from the mtt viability assay highlight the significant level of resistance achieved in the rh <dig> sub-line . this cell line, designated resistant- rh <dig> or "res30", expresses a stable phenotype in which the ic <dig> for as-daca is  <dig> nm, making it 450-fold more resistant to as-daca than its parent . importantly, the cells retained their resistant phenotype over time. cytotoxicity measurements reveal that res <dig> cells have no cross-resistance to the topoisomerase ii poisons doxorubicin and mitoxantrone  , and that 9-amino-daca, a potent cytotoxic as- daca analogue lacking the 5-methylsulphone group  <cit> , shows only a limited  <dig> -fold loss of potency . given that as-daca induces cell death as a result of the accumulation of dna double strand breaks due to the poisoning of topoisomerases  <cit> , we investigated the level of such strand breaks induced by as- daca in the rms cells by measuring the level of phosphorylation of histone h2a.x , known as γh2a.x, which is a well-established marker of dna double strand breaks  <cit> . phosphorylation was assessed over  <dig> h in all cell lines following exposure to as-daca at a low dose, equivalent to the ic <dig> for rh <dig> cells . the results are expressed as a percentage of the dna damage observed, compared, over the equivalent time, to that caused by a dose of  <dig> μm as-daca : a dose that produces maximal damage in the least sensitive rd cells. whilst dna damage is evident after just  <dig> h in the sensitive rh <dig> cells, its appearance is delayed  <dig> h in the resistant res <dig> cells, and then reaches only 10% of the damage induced with a  <dig> μm dose of as- daca after  <dig> h: a value only ~15% of that of the parental rh <dig> cell line . interestingly, dna breaks are detected in rd cells after just  <dig> h, despite the drug concentration being approximately  <dig> times lower than its ic <dig> in this cell line. at  <dig> h the level of dna damage reached 40% of the maximum caused by a  <dig> μm dose . these findings demonstrate that the level of dna damage is directly proportional to the ic <dig> of as-daca in each cell line.

since as-daca is a known substrate of the abc transport proteins  <cit> , we explored the influence of a representative transporter, mrp <dig>  on as-daca activity in our sensitive and resistant rms cell lines. in non-drug-treated cells, immunofluorescence microscopy of the mrp <dig> protein shows diffuse cytoplasmic localization in both rd and rh <dig> cells , whereas in res <dig> cells, mrp <dig> is localized in a punctuate fashion in the perinuclear region, suggestive of vesicular localization . after  <dig> h exposure to as-daca there was no change in mrp <dig> localization in rd or res <dig> cells, but, in contrast, mrp <dig> in rh <dig> cells now localises in a punctuate perinuclear pattern, similar to that observed in untreated res <dig> cells . western blot analysis of mrp <dig> expression levels shows a significant rise in rd and rh <dig> cells following a  <dig> h exposure to twice the ic <dig> of as-daca for each cell line  . .

in contrast, although mrp <dig> is well-expressed in res <dig> cells, its level decreases following exposure to the drug . exposure to the mrp <dig> inhibitor r-verapamil at concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> μm fails to alter as-daca-induced cytotoxicity , indicating the differential toxicity of as-daca in the rms cells is not simply explained by a classical understanding of drug resistance involving mrp <dig> 

taking advantage of the fluorescent properties of as-daca  <cit>  to assess its intracellular distribution in rms cells, we exposed cells to  <dig> μm as-daca for  <dig> h and excited in the uv range , to show, as anticipated, that the drug accumulates in the nucleus . unexpectedly, however, as-daca was also observed to accumulate in punctate structures within the cytoplasm. as highlighted in the true colour photographs of figure 4a, as-daca fluoresces green when localized to the nucleus, and blue when accumulated in small vesicle-like structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm in both cell lines. interestingly, there is no evidence of vesicle accumulation of doxorubicin in rd and rh <dig> cells , which hints at a different mechanism for accumulation, perhaps reflecting the different charge states of as-daca and the anthracycline. these findings prompted us to examine the fluorescence properties of as-daca as a function of ph, and figure 4b shows its emission spectrum in the range  <dig> to  <dig> nm when excited in the uv at  <dig> nm. as the ph is lowered from  <dig>  to  <dig> , the green emission peak around  <dig> nm remains essentially unchanged, but the intensity of the blue emission at  <dig> nm increases substantially to become the dominant feature in this region of the spectrum. this spectral change occurs in the ph range where the acridine chromophore becomes protonated   <cit> , and, in consequence, provides a measure of the charged state of the ligand. thus, with excitation in the uv, fluorescence microscopy reveals the presence of as-daca in the nucleus where it is bound to dna as a monocation  <cit>  and fluoresces green; and in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles where it is a blue-fluorescing dication .

we wished to determine whether the differences seen in the distribution of as-daca between the nucleus and vesicular structures in the two rms cells lines is responsible for their differential sensitivity to as-daca toxicity. in addition, we were interested in discovering which of the cellular compartments is first to accumulate as-daca. accordingly, we used a deconvolution microscope, equipped with computerized exposure control during imaging, for a more precise rendering of as-daca fluorescence. this was especially useful following the short treatment times designed to highlight the agents early accumulation throughout the cell. figure 4c shows the intracellular distribution of  <dig> μm as-daca following a  <dig> min incubation, where it can be seen that as-daca can indeed be detected in both the nucleus  and vesicles  of both rms cell lines under these rapid-uptake conditions. the appearance of blue cytoplasmic structures occurs in both sensitive and resistant cell lines, indicative of accumulation into acidic vesicles. on rare occasions, in both cell lines, only blue vesicles can be detected, indicating vesicle accumulation prior to nuclear binding . to provide independent evidence that the vesicles into which as-daca accumulates really are acidic, we treated cells with both as-daca and lysotracker™ red, a fluorescent dye known to accumulate within acidic compartments. co-localization of lysotracker™ red and as-daca was observed in the majority of vesicles  in both cell types. however, further digital deconvolution of the microscopic images indicated that co-localization of the two agents is not always complete, with some vesicles showing only as-daca  accumulation .

the expression levels of markers specific for vesicles active at various stages of the membrane trafficking process were examined in all rms cells, after exposure to double their ic <dig> for as-daca for  <dig> h. the expression levels of early endosome antigen  <dig> , rab <dig>  lysosomal-associated membrane protein  <dig> , and rab <dig>  were assessed by western blot analysis . lamp <dig>  which is associated with both lysosomes and late stage endosomes, and rab <dig>  a protein associated with late stage endosomes, were shown not to be differentially expressed in any of the cell lines, and were minimally affected by drug treatment. however, expression of eea <dig>  a marker of early endosomes, is substantially higher in the resistant rd and res <dig> lines, and the clearly greater signal observed in res <dig> cells, relative to rh <dig>  is unperturbed by an additional overnight treatment of drug . rab <dig>  which is also associated with early endosomes, shows similarly marked lower expression in rh <dig> cells relative to res <dig>  although, now, its expression is only marginally less than in rd cells .

we hypothesized that the decrease in the amount of early endosomes in rh <dig> cells contributes to their sensitivity to as-daca, due to a lack of vesicular sequestration, which would allow the drug to pass freely throughout the cell and into the nucleus and surrounding cells. to test this, we grew rd and rh <dig> cells as 3-dimensional spheroids, and assessed the ability of as-daca to pass through multiple cell layers. unfortunately res <dig> cells were unable to be grown as spheroids. after  <dig> h of incubation at  <dig> μm, the distribution of fluorescence at both emission wavelengths across the spheroids is equivalent for both cell lines, with the intensity of nuclear green fluorescence within  <dig> μm of the spheroid edge being 10% greater than that of vesicular blue fluorescence. after  <dig> h, however, the distribution of fluorescence across the spheroids is considerably altered. the blue fluorescence is now more intense than green at the outer edge , the difference being the most pronounced in the rd cells where the peak is ~10% below that of the rh <dig> cells, indicating a larger as-daca signal in the vesicles. furthermore, after  <dig> h, as-daca is seen to penetrate further into the rh <dig> spheroids, with equivalent levels of both green and blue fluorescence being found approximately twice as deep into the cell mass as observed at  <dig> h. by contrast, in rd cells, both fluorescence signals are below 30% relative fluorescent intensity beyond a penetration distance of  <dig> μm, indicating that as-daca is unable to penetrate far into the rd cell mass even after a lengthy incubation. evidently, as-daca traverses packed rh <dig> cells much more readily than packed rd cells, and it is notable that the blue vesicular signal leads the way into the spheroid masses.

discussion
the sensitivity of rms cell lines to new agents may help identify novel strategies in treatment for this often refractory sarcoma. cytotoxins based on acridine-4-carboxamide chromophores, such as the methyl sulphone derivative of n-- ethyl)acridine-4-carboxamide, known as as-daca , trap topoisomerase cleavable complexes  <cit> , showing topoisomerase ii activity  <cit> . the 190-fold differential cytotoxic response to as-daca detected between two rms cell lines  correlates with the delayed production of double strand breaks   which was not cross resistant to known topoisomerase poisons  suggests a resistance mechanism peculiar to as- daca was invoked and is suitable for comparison to the resistant rd cell line. the absence of double strand breaks in the res- <dig> line  indicates extensive impedance of the agent from its primary cytotoxic target.

active mechanisms that drive sequestration of weakly basic compounds into vesicles of the membrane trafficking system are not uncommon. several of the abc transport pumps have been implicated in such mechanisms  <cit>  and alternative pathways involving the trans-golgi network  <cit> , lung-resistance-related protein  <dig>  and major vault proteins  <cit>  have been proposed to modify intracellular drug distributions by altering transport between the nucleus, endosomal vesicles, lysosomes and the cytoplasm  <cit> . in  <dig>  rajagopal et al  <cit>  using hela cells, showed that mrp <dig>  p-gp and bcrp were not only localized to membranes of intracellular vesicles but their roles at these sites contributed to drug resistance phenotypes via sequestration-based mechanisms. as illustrated in figure  <dig> higher levels of the abc transport protein mrp <dig> following treatment with as-daca was detected, typical of a "classical' multidrug resistance phenotype in rms cells. however, this treatment-induced increased expression of mrp <dig> in cell lines does not explain the differential in sensitivity to as-daca induced cell death. firstly, both rd and rh <dig> cell lines demonstrated an equivalent increase in mrp <dig> expression . interestingly, mrp <dig> protein was shown to localize to vesicular membranes in all three cell lines  this being most prominent in cells directly after exposure to as-daca as well as in the derived as-daca resistant line res <dig> pretreatment. despite this, the absence of any effects of the mrp <dig> inhibitor verapamil on both the as-daca resistant lines , indicating that impedance of mrp <dig> activity did not alter as-daca toxicity in any rms cells.

classically, vesicle sequestration of the anthracycline antibiotics appears to be dictated by the "partitioning theory". the partitioning theory of drug sequestration, which was proposed not long after the discovery of the lysosome in the 1960's,  <cit>  is still believed to contribute significantly to drug resistance  <cit> . this theory is based upon the principle that weak acids and bases are capable of readily diffusing lipid bilayer membranes down ph gradients, rendering these compounds able to accumulate in acidic vesicles due to protonation by free h+ ions present in the vesicular lumen. such ionization renders the drug impermeable to the membrane and accumulation will continue whilst vesicular h+ ion concentrations are maintained  <cit> .

like the anthracyclines, as-daca features a protonation site at the dimethylaminoethyl side chain   <cit> . fluorescence spectrophotometry indicated that with a reduction in ph, still within a physiological range to  <dig> , we see a greater intensity of blue fluorescence from as-daca . together, the results presented highlight that as-daca is sequestered by acidic vesicles of the membrane trafficking system limiting its opportunity to enter the nucleus. despite this evidence, nuclear accumulation of as- daca as evidenced by fluorescent microscopy appeared to be unaltered when examined on a cell-by-cell approach. however, it is thought that the mechanisms have greater relevance in the treatment of solid tumours such as rms where drug penetration of the tumour mass is obstructed in the outer layers of the tumour  <cit> . we have shown that impaired penetration of as-daca into a solid mass of the resistant rd cells correlates to a reduction of drug accumulation into the nucleus when compared to the sensitive rh <dig> cells, as evidenced by green fluorescence peaks . from initial drug exposure of the rms cells, as-daca is captured into acidic vesicles where no difference was detectable between cell lines after 10minutes . it is only after extended exposure to  <dig> hours that the spheroids indicate a greater penetrance of as-daca fluorescence into rh <dig> spheroids implicating a more efficacious drug-vesicle-transport mechanism in the sensitive cells or a delayed system leading to drug sequestration in the resistant cells.

knockdown of the major vault protein  using sirna disrupted lysosomal uptake of not only doxorubicin, but also the intracellular ph probe lysosensor and the lysosomal specific antigen lamp <dig>  this study indicated that mvp was integral in redistributing the drug away from the nucleus to lysosomes  <cit> . on this basis, a simple explanation of our findings is that the distribution of different vesicle types present in the cell dictates the different response to as-daca. clearly as-daca is being captured into acidic cellular compartments  but which are pre-lysosomal, . assessment of protein markers associated with vesicles of the membrane trafficking system revealed that reduced expression the early endosomal markers eea <dig> and rab <dig> was found in the sensitive rh <dig> cells but increased in the as-daca resistant res- <dig> to level equal to or above of the rd cell line . however, the lysosomal markers lamp <dig> and rab <dig> were unchanged between all cell lines. whether as-daca is merely redistributed away from the nucleus or whether it is effluxed from the cells remains unknown, but unlike mrp <dig>  no significant treatment induced change in expression of these acidic vesicle markers was observed, indicating that this is an intrinsic difference between the rd and rh <dig> cell lines.

CONCLUSIONS
the implication from our findings suggests that reduced levels of early endosomal vesicles limit the sequestration and redistribution of as-daca away from the nucleus in rh <dig> cells and hence does not offer any protection from the effects of the drug with topoisomerase poisoning. taking the evidence as a whole shows that endosomal vesicle trafficking influences the toxicity of as-daca in rms cells and highlights potential new biological targets worthy of further study.

interestingly, sequestration of as-daca was identified through the intracellular visualization of the drug. most established molecules used to treat cancer however cannot be visualized and hence similar mechanisms may go undetected, only manifesting themselves through a poor tumour response to therapy. the unique fluorescence properties of as-daca may be exploited in new and alternative methods of assessing drug penetration, distribution and the overall pharmacokinetics of the drug. hence, we believe that, regardless of the drugs fate in clinical development, it will provide an invaluable tool to cancer pharmacology researchers interested in understanding the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of weakly basic cytotoxic compounds.
