BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni  is a gram-negative micro-aerophilic bacterium responsible for the majority of human bacterial enteric infections worldwide  <cit> . c. jejuni is commonly found as a commensal organism in the intestinal tracts of a wide range of wild and domestic animals, including commercial poultry  <cit> . cross-contamination from raw poultry or insufficient cooking of poultry meat are common sources of infection. enteric infections by this pathogen are often associated with a potent localized inflammatory response. symptoms arising from infection include watery or bloody diarrhoea with abdominal cramping and fever. in addition, c. jejuni can be invasive and is associated with septicaemia, meningitis, guillain-barré syndrome  <cit>  and more recently with immuno-proliferative disease  <cit> .

c. jejuni virulence factors for human disease include flagella based chemotaxis, adhesin-based cellular adherence, host cell invasion and the elaboration of a heat labile cytolethal distending toxin   <cit>  in previous studies we have additionally shown that a heat stable c. jejuni boiled cell extract  is able to activate the transcription factor nf-κb   <cit> . this signalling molecule is responsible for inducing the expression of a number of genes involved in inflammation and cell mediated immunity  <cit> , including chemokines capable of attracting leukocytes, resulting in inflammation. nf-κb is held inactive in the cytoplasm of a cell, whilst its nuclear localization domain is masked by inhibitory iκb proteins. if iκb is phosphorylated, leading to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, then nf-κb is released to transport to the nucleus of the cell, where it affects transcription of κb-responsive promoters. therefore products that activate nf-κb can be presumed to have a strong role in triggering inflammation. previous work has shown that live c. jejuni and a bce can induce both nf-κb, and the synthesis and release of the chemokine interleukin- <dig>  <cit> .

in order to identify a wider range of genes affected by c. jejuni products and assess the relative importance of the nf-κb response we used microarray technologies to identify genes that were both up and down-regulated in hca- <dig> cells after exposure to a c. jejuni bce  <cit> . use of the ingenuity pathway analysis  program suite enabled us to group co-regulated genes in order to identify the cellular signalling pathways activated in hca- <dig> cells in response to c. jejuni bce. the transcriptomic data were confirmed by real time quantitative pcr .

methods
c. jejuni culture and preparation of bce
the type strain c. jejuni national collection of type cultures   <dig> was used throughout these experiments, since it was originally isolated from a patient with diarrhoea, its genome sequence is available and it has a well-characterized pathological phenotype  <cit> . it was incubated on blood-agar plates  under micro-aerobic conditions for  <dig> h. and used to inoculate nutrient broth no.  <dig> . inoculated flasks were shaken at  <dig> rpm at 42°c for  <dig> h. under micro-aerobic conditions. culture purity was determined by plating samples from each overnight culture onto blood plates and incubating for  <dig> h., 42°c in micro-aerobic conditions. bacteria were collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min. the cell pellet was washed three times in phosphate buffered saline , weighed and re-suspended in pbs to achieve a 10%  suspension, which was boiled for  <dig> min., cooled on ice for  <dig> min. before being centrifuged at  <dig>   <dig> g for  <dig> min. the supernatant was collected, passed through a  <dig>  μm filter to remove residual bacteria and stored at -20°c until required.

hca- <dig> cell culture and treatment with c. jejuni bce
the human colonocyte line hca- <dig>  <cit> , clone  <dig>  was grown to confluence in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere in monolayer cultures on monolayer dishes in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented  with  <dig> μg/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin and fetal calf serum at 10%  at 37°c. twenty-four hours prior to induction by bce, hca- <dig> cells were transferred to serum-free dmem. hca- <dig> cells were then incubated for  <dig> h. with  <dig> μl bce or pbs control in a total volume of  <dig> ml of dmem. the bce preparation was determined in parallel to induce nf-κb 300-fold using a reporter cell assay  <cit> . at  <dig> h. post induction total rnas were extracted using rnaeasy columns . total rna yields and purity were determined using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer .

cdna synthesis
approximately  <dig> μg of total rna was reverse transcribed at 42°c for  <dig> h. to generate first strand dna using  <dig> pmol oligo dt primer containing a 5'-t <dig> rna polymerase promoter sequence 24-3'),  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm dithiothreitol ,  <dig> mm dntps and  <dig> units superscript ii reverse transcriptase . second strand dna synthesis was carried out at 16°c for  <dig> h., using  <dig> units of e. coli polymerase i,  <dig> units of e. coli dna ligase and  <dig> units of rnase h in a reaction containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm so <dig>   <dig>  mm β-nad+ and  <dig> mm dntps.  <dig> units of t <dig> dna polymerase were added and the reaction allowed to proceed for a further  <dig> min. before termination with  <dig>  m edta. double stranded cdna products were purified using the genechip sample cleanup module .

crna synthesis
the synthetic cdnas were in vitro transcribed using t <dig> rna polymerase  with biotinylated ribonucleotides to generated biotinylated complementary rnas . the crnas were purified using the genechip sample cleanup module before random fragmentation at 94°c for  <dig> min. in a buffer containing  <dig> mm tris-acetate ,  <dig> mm potassium acetate and  <dig> mm magnesium acetate to generate molecules of approximately  <dig> to  <dig> bases long.

array hybridization
changes in gene transcription were analyzed by hybridization to affymetrix human genome u133a array  which contains probes for over  <dig>  transcripts, including representation of the refseq database sequences and probe sets http://www.affymetrix.com/products_services/arrays/specific/hgu <dig> affx. the fragmented crnas were mixed with  <dig>  mg/ml of sonicated herring sperm dna in a hybridization buffer containing  <dig> mm 2-n-morpholino-ethane-sulfonic acid ,  <dig> m nacl,  <dig> mm edta and 10% tween  <dig> to make the hybridization mixture. the hybridization mixture containing the fragmented crna was denatured at 99°c for  <dig> min. and equilibrated for a further  <dig> min. at 45°c before centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min. to remove any insoluble material from the hybridization mixture. the hybridization mix was transferred to the ath1- <dig> genome array  cartridge and hybridized at 45°c for  <dig> h. on a rotisserie at  <dig> rpm.

after a  <dig> h. hybridization period the arrays were washed and stained in a fluidics station . the arrays were initially washed in a low stringency buffer a  at 25°c for  <dig> min. and then incubated with a high stringency buffer b  at 50°c for  <dig> min. and stained with  <dig> mg/ml of streptavidin phycoerythrin , in stain buffer containing  <dig> mm mes,  <dig> m nacl,  <dig> % tween  <dig> and  <dig> mg/ml bsa at 25°c for  <dig> min. after a further wash in wash buffer a at 25°c for  <dig> min. they were stained with biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody at 25°c for  <dig> min. after antibody staining the arrays were stained again with sape for signal amplification and washed with buffer a at 30°c for  <dig> min. the arrays were finally scanned and the intensities averaged with the agilent genearray scanner .

statistical analysis of array data and generation of networks and canonical pathways
in order to identify genes of interest we used the s score  algorithm as implemented in the bioconductor software suite http://www.bioconductor.org <cit>  based on the r package http://www.r-project.org <cit>  that takes advantage of the fact that most genes are unchanged and calculates an s score . the s score threshold of +/-  <dig>  and an alpha value of p =  <dig>  was used to define gene changes of interest. data listing all genes that satisfied these criteria were analyzed by ingenuity pathway analysis, ingenuity® systems, http://www.ingenuity.com. this generated functional networks and canonical pathways that connect the differentially expressed genes, using the ipa knowledge base, where the interactions are supported by peer reviewed publications and which contains over  <dig>  million interactions between genes, proteins, and drugs. scores were assigned allowing ranking of the networks, using a fisher's right tailed exact test.

analysis of microarray data by real time quantitative pcr
to confirm microarray results, extracted hca- <dig> total rna was amplified by oligo dt primers according to the im-prom ii kit  methodology. representative samples of genes from a number of the major functional groups and gene networks identified by ipa program were selected to confirm the array data using rq-pcr analysis  under appropriate conditions for an abi prism  <dig>  primer and probe design utilized primer express software . the primers were validated for gene specificity by agarose gel electrophoresis. reporter dye-labelled probes were used with fam  at the 5'-end and tamra  at the 3'-end. reactions were set up in a final volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig>  μl of  <dig> × taqman universal pcr mastermix :  <dig>  μl of each primer ,  <dig>  μl of probe ,  <dig> μl of cdna  and  <dig>  μl of water. samples were analyzed in triplicate and the emission released reporter dye was monitored by an abi prism  <dig> sequence detector  using the default pcr program of  <dig> min at 50°c and  <dig> min at 95°c; each cycle included denaturing at 95°c for  <dig> s and annealing at 60°c for  <dig> min. analysis of the data was via the sequence detection system  software . a no template control was included in each analysis and did not give any signal with any of the primer/probe combinations. rq-pcr data were normalized using primers to β-actin based on the considerations outlined by hugget et al.  <cit> .

forward primer, reverse primer and taqman probes for rq-pcr assays used, all listed 5' - 3' direction.

chemokine and cytokine analyses
cultured cells were prepared and induced as described above. after  <dig> h. incubation, the media was removed and stored at -20°c until examined using a coulter-alter flow cytometer in conjunction with a bd cytometric bead array human inflammation kit according to manufacturer's instructions . il <dig> and ccl <dig>  were specifically measured using a sandwich elisa, by capture with a murine anti-human il <dig> or ccl <dig> and detected using biotinylated goat anti-human il <dig> using streptavidin-coupled horseradish-peroxidase, according to the manufacturer's instructions .

RESULTS
the bioconductor and ipa programs identified  <dig> genes that changed with a positive or negative s score of  <dig>  or greater . three hundred were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated .

up-regulated genes
down-regulated genes
fewer genes were down-regulated than those that were up-regulated and negative s scores were less pronounced than those for the up-regulated genes. for comparative purposes table  <dig> shows down-regulated genes that were selected on the basis of a more permissive s score of - <dig>  or less to yield a similar number . these genes were grouped by class and ordered by the highest negatively regulated  s score in each class. the pattern of down-regulated gene classes differ markedly to those that were up-regulated. most prominent were genes concerned with the maintenance of normal cell cycle, dna replication and cell structure. the down-regulated group feature specific genes encoding components involved in membrane transport, mitosis, nucleotide synthesis, transcription, protein synthesis and export, membrane transport and energy metabolism.

signalling pathways
ipa identified a number of canonical signalling pathways that were most significantly affected . figure  <dig> shows a simplified composite of all genes identified by ipa as being part of specific signalling pathways that are most significantly regulated, together with their individual s scores. here the central mediator is the nf-κb signalling pathway that is clearly contributory in affecting the signalling through the death receptor, il <dig>  il <dig>  toll-like receptor and ppar pathways . in addition, several other canonical signalling pathways, some of which do not feature nf-κb, were also identified as significantly affected.

the antigen presentation pathway was identified through up-regulation of the large multifunctional protease - <dig>  transporter associated with antigen processing   <dig>  tap-binding protein , calreticulin  and the major histocompatibility complex 1-α.

activation of the interferon-γ receptor defence signalling pathway was noted through up-regulation of both components of interferon-γ receptor, janus kinase   <dig> and tyrosine kinase   <dig> 

activation of the ephrin signalling pathway, indicating activation of actin-based cytokinesis and repulsion. the pathway included up-regulation of ephrin receptor sub components, rho family, gtp binding protein , cell division cycle   <dig>  wiskott-aldrich syndrome protein , actin-related protein  <dig> , v-crk homologue  and ras oncogene family member 1b with rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase   <dig> 

finally, up-regulation of most components of the pi3k-phosphatase signalling pathway were noted, including phosphatase and tensin homology  pathway indicating possible effects on the cell cycle, including cell division cycle   <dig>  forkhead box o1a and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1a . sfn  however, was down-regulated.

predicted functional effects
the ipa program can determine if groups of significantly changed genes have related cellular and molecular functions . here ipa identified  <dig> functional categories that were significantly affected by the c. jejuni bce. the most prominent functions implicated were cellular movement , cell growth and proliferation and cell death.

gene networks
the ipa program constructed  <dig> interconnected gene networks that were significantly altered as a result of treatment of hca- <dig> cells with c. jejuni bce, all with network scores of ≥  <dig>  the network score is the probability that a network would be assembled by chance where a level of >  <dig> is statistically significant, at p <  <dig> . in the four most significantly regulated all  <dig> focus genes of the network were affected, all giving an identical score of  <dig> .

the first network  contains genes concerned with cellular movement, particularly chemotaxis. nf-κb occupies a central position in the network and includes a number of genes which are known to up-regulate including a number of chemokines.

the second network  likewise contains genes associated with cellular movement, including cytokinesis and inflammatory responses. up-regulated genes include ephrin receptor b <dig> , ptgs <dig> , icam <dig>  both components of interferon-γ receptor, il23a, il27ra, jak <dig>  junb proto oncogene, mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase , tyk <dig>  mothers against dpp homologues   <dig>  with  <dig> genes shown to be significantly down-regulated .

myc occupies a central position in the third network , which contains genes concerned with the regulation of the cell cycle. up-regulated genes include myc as well as fas, folate receptor , hla molecules e, f and g, laminins β <dig>  α <dig>  and γ <dig> , matrix metallo proteinase  <dig>  and sod <dig>  down-regulated were laminin β <dig> , ran binding protein  <dig>  thioredoxin interacting protein  and thymidylate synthetase .

finally, a network  contains genes affecting cell death and gene expression. the network contains  <dig> genes that were up-regulated, including activating transcription factor   <dig>  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins   <dig> and  <dig> , cyclin dependent kinase   <dig>  cyclin dependant kinase inhibitor  1a, gata binding protein   <dig>  tnfα-induced protein   <dig>  the tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand , its receptor trailr <dig>  and tnf receptor associated factor   <dig>  whilst cdkn1a is up-regulated, cdkn <dig> is down-regulated, as are the inhibitors of dna binding  <dig>  and  <dig>  mini-chromosome maintenance homologue   <dig>  rcf <dig>  rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase   <dig> and s-phase kinase-associated protein   <dig> 

validation of microarray data
changes in gene expression identified by microarray were confirmed by rq-pcr . however, hierarchical differences are apparent between the rq-pcr values normalized against β-actin compared with the s score associated with the significantly regulated genes as indicated by differential hybridization of the crna preparations to the microarray.

for each gene ingenuity description, name and affymetrix probe set, assigned network and cellular location are shown together with the s score and fold rq-pcr change compared to β-actin control.

chemokine and cytokine responses
to further validate the gene transcriptional changes using microarray and rq-pcr methods, we measured the levels of secretory immunomodulatory proteins in parallel cell supernatants of hca- <dig> cells pre- and post-induction with c. jejuni bce. table  <dig> presents the chemokine and cytokine levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory secretory proteins. consistent with the microarray observations the pro-inflammatory chemokine ccl <dig> showed a  <dig> -fold increase in levels  <dig> h. post treatment. il <dig> levels were also found to increase, but far more dramatically than ccl <dig> with a 460-fold induction. hca- <dig> colonocytes are particularly il <dig> responsive with post-induction levels of  <dig>  ng/ml, an observation that is consistent with previous reports with this cell line  <cit> . the pro-inflammatory cytokine il1β showed a weak response consistent with the transcriptional response recorded in the microarray study. pro-inflammatory cytokine il <dig> showed a 5-fold increase, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine il <dig> remained static. the transcriptional response of the genes encoding il <dig> and il <dig> did not show marked transcriptional changes but the pathways associated with these immunomodulatory proteins were recognized by ipa and are responsive to nf-κb.

discussion
understanding the pathogenesis of c. jejuni enteric disease is important both because c. jejuni is a major cause of diarrhoeal illness worldwide and because it may serve as a model for ulcerative colitis, the pathology of which it closely resembles  <cit> . previous work has shown that direct interaction between c. jejuni and epithelial cells is capable of inducing pro-inflammatory and pro-secretory processes  <cit> . these are associated with cellular invasion  <cit>  and secretion of il <dig> by cldt dependent and independent mechanisms  <cit> . direct use of a bce has allowed us to use a reductionist approach to investigate effects of c. jejuni that are not dominated by these linked processes of cellular invasion by live bacteria and by toxin based cell lysis. bce has been determined to contain polysaccharide and protein components of the cell. as demonstrated previously the nf-κb inducing activity of c. jejuni bce is relatively insensitive to digestion by protease k  <cit> . however the protein content has been determined using tryptic digests of sds-polyacryamide extracted protein bands using maldi-tof mass spectrometry as flagellin , trigger factor , lipoprotein , major outer membrane protein , cytochrome-c peroxidase , bacterioferritin , cell binding factor peb4a , hypothetical protein , periplasmic protein , fibronectin binding protein , non-heme iron protein , periplasmic protein , periplasmic protein , periplasmic protein , dna-binding protein hu , periplasmic cytochrome c  and thioredoxin   <cit> . the polysaccharide component features α-glucan oligomers. the c. jejuni extract is notably devoid of the dominating heat-labile effects of the cldt. c. jejuni bce, like infection with live c. jejuni, has been shown to be a potent inducer of nf-κb using either luciferase based reporter assays, western blots with antibodies against iκb or electrophoretic mobility shift assays in epithelial cells  <cit>  but, unlike treatment with live c. jejuni, this does not lead to host cell lysis. these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that a heat stable component plays a significant role in the pro-inflammatory response upon exposure to c. jejuni.

we hypothesize that nf-κb modulation is central to the response of enterocytes to c. jejuni bce; to study this we determined the global changes in gene expression induced by c. jejuni bce treatment of the well-differentiated human colonocyte line hca- <dig>  clone  <dig>  in order to ensure the relevance of our results we have adopted stringent criteria for the identification of significantly affected genes and used the ipa program to determine the functional links between these gene products, identify the signalling pathways and networks to which they belong. these changes were validated by showing similar affects on mrna levels when genes of interest were investigated by real-time quantitative pcr.

consistent with the initial hypothesis that nf-κb plays a major role in the response of hca- <dig> cells to c. jejuni bce, and features in  <dig> of the  <dig> designated signalling pathways identified by ipa as up-regulated. moreover, all genes in the nf-κb associated network  were up-regulated by c. jejuni bce. the dominant component of this response concerned up regulation of chemokines that would act to induce the influx of acute inflammatory cells that characterize campylobacter colitis. our data are remarkably similar to transcriptomic data reported by hinata et al., who activated nf-κb by transfecting clones expressing subunits of nf-κb to show up-regulation of the chemokines cxcl <dig>  il <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , ccl <dig>  as well as il1α and csf <dig>  all of which were also significantly up-regulated in our study  <cit> . the nfkb <dig>  nfkb <dig> and relb components of nf-κb are also similarly up-regulated in our study. other changes that are likely to be of functional importance and are the up-regulation of cox <dig> , tnip <dig>  myc, sod <dig>  elf <dig> and icam <dig> , where all of these processes are also downstream targets of nf-κb  <cit>  and mediators of feedback inhibition of nf-κb activation such as nfkbia   <cit> , tnip <dig>  <cit>  and tnip <dig>   <cit> . a central role for nf-κb is also supported by data using the monocytic cell line thp- <dig>  <cit> . studies in which caco- <dig> cells were incubated with live bacteria resulted in expression of many genes similar to those reported here, including chemokines, but additionally, the nf-κb inhibitor nfkbiz  <cit> . this difference may reflect the ability of live bacteria to invade cells and/or elaborate a cldt with dnase activity  <cit> .

the pattern of significantly down-regulated genes  is remarkably different with a reduction in expression in constitutively expressed genes concerned with nucleotide synthesis, transcription, dna replication, mitosis, structural protein synthesis, membrane transport and energy metabolism. these changes likely reflect the reprioritization of cellular metabolism in response to pro-inflammatory products.

whether the changes caused by the c. jejuni bce would lead to increased or reduced apoptosis is difficult to predict, especially as hca- <dig> lack a functional tp <dig> protein, although these cells are capable of apoptosis given the appropriate signal  <cit> . invasive c. jejuni infection can cause cell death in hca- <dig> cells  <cit> , although we did not see this with the addition of bce  <cit> . increased expression of members of the death receptor pathway, the tnfα superfamily and their receptors, but also of tnfα agonists may imply regulated activation of pro-apoptotic activity  <cit> . up-regulation of trail, dr <dig>  and fas ligand acting via fadd, the universal adaptor protein known domain-containing members of the tnf receptor superfamily, would successively activate caspases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as well as possible g1-s cell cycle progression  <cit> . however, the antagonists tnfaip <dig>  flip and ciap, which respectively inhibit apoptosis via traf <dig>  caspases  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and traf- <dig> directly or indirectly are also prominent amongst the up-regulated genes  <cit> .

moreover, several other key proteins for the cell cycle and apoptosis are affected. thus cdkn1a  which plays a pivotal role in inhibiting cell cycle progression at several points in response to dna damage  <cit> , is up-regulated, as are foxo1a and smad  <dig>  and  <dig> , which act together to increase cdkn1a activity  <cit> . conversely, other genes that inhibit cell cycle progression are down-regulated. these include skp <dig>  the f-box receptor that interacts with p <dig> and the cdk2/cyclin a to prevent entry into g <dig>  <cit>  and sfn  a key target of the tumour suppressor gene tp <dig> which acts to cause g <dig> arrest  <cit> .

five other changes of potential functional importance are of note. firstly, a number of potentially antibacterial agents are highly induced, including lcn <dig>   <cit>  and pi <dig>   <cit> , whilst mmp <dig> is thought to activate defensins  <cit> . secondly, five key molecules involved in antigen processing and presentation   <cit>  were also up-regulated and could play a role in the development of immune responses to c. jejuni. thirdly, alterations in matrix metalloproteinases and leukocyte receptors would influence the inflammatory response, with mmp <dig> acting to facilitate neutrophil transfer by activating interleukin- <dig>  <cit>  and mmp <dig> acting to localize them to sites of tissue damage  <cit> . fourthly, the ephrin pathway , including ephrin a <dig> and b <dig> receptors  and ephrin a <dig> , rho kinase , rac, arp2/ <dig>  cdc <dig> and wasp appeared to be strongly up-regulated. this pathway is concerned with activation of cytokinetic changes that may potentially play a role in rapid restitution  <cit> . finally, up-regulation of the folate receptor  may reflect preparation for reparative nucleotide synthesis dependent upon one-carbon transfer activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data we have generated using a bce of c. jejuni represents a reductionist approach to determine some of the cellular responses associated with c. jejuni infection. however, because c. jejuni bce represents a robust nf-κb inducing activity that is not only heat-stable but resistant to protease and acidic ph   <cit> , these may indeed be of clinical significance if these products are shed upon c. jejuni infection or co-delivered through the diet. c. jejuni has been detected in many commercially available chicken portions  <cit>  and clinical cases of campylobacter enterocolitis are frequently associated with ingestion of partially cooked poultry meat  <cit> .

changes in host gene expression following c. jejuni bce interestingly reflects some of the changes that are known to occur in inflammatory bowel diseases  such as ulcerative colitis, for which c. jejuni colitis can be considered a model, and may therefore indicate other potential targets for investigation of epithelial-derived mediators of inflammation in ulcerative colitis/ibd. up-regulation of nf-κb is well recognized and considered a possible target of mesalazine  <cit> . genes up-regulated by c. jejuni that have been associated with active ulcerative colitis/ibd include chemokines  <cit> , such as il <dig> and ccl <dig>   <cit>  cytokines, including tnfα  <cit> , eicosanoids  <cit>  and elafin  <cit> . il <dig>  il <dig>  <cit>  and receptors such as interferon-γ receptor, and tlr <dig>  <cit>  have all been demonstrated to be altered here . activation of pro-apoptotic pathways involving the tnf superfamily and death domain signalling pathway have been reported to be up-regulated in colonic enterocytes isolated from patients with ulcerative colitis, from which c-iap <dig>  has been proposed as a disease marker  <cit> , whilst the leukocytes serine anti-proteinase elafin has recently been identified as a candidate biomarker for ulcerative colitis but with attenuated induction in crohn's disease  <cit> . thus, the data we report here include a number of pathways and mediators that may be realistic anti-inflammatory therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce the activity of c. jejuni colitis or ulcerative colitis. these targets include mechanisms for chemoattraction of inflammatory cells, cellular processes associated with repair and the processes associated with apoptosis, as well as nf-κb itself, the utilization of which can be investigated by intervention studies in model systems and humans.
