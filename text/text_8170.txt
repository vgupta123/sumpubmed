BACKGROUND
horizontal transfer  of genetic materials between reproductively isolated species is an important mechanism in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes . recent studies showed that ht events are also widespread in animals and plants and mainly concern transposable elements  . tes are usually grouped into two distinct classes: class i elements  and class ii elements   <cit> . retrotransposons, which integrate into new sites via a copy and paste mechanism, are often the major components in the genomes of many eukaryotic species, especially those with large genomes  <cit> . retrotransposons constitute over 50 % of the genomes in many plants  <cit> . in mammals, line- <dig>  retrotransposons’ activity alone generated at least 20 % of the genome  <cit> . the horizontally transferred tes are also mainly retrotransposons  <cit> . however, unlike retroviruses, retrotransposons do not encode an envelope protein and hence require a vector between species to transpose horizontally. the vector discussed here is often thought to be parasites, which have ample opportunities to exchange genetic material with their hosts as the result of an intimate, long-term physical association  <cit> . in eukaryotes, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, but the proximity of species is almost indispensable in all ht events and may consequently increase the likelihood of ht. if ht also plays an important role in eukaryotic evolution, we may expect to find more evidence of ht events among species that are distantly related in taxonomy yet live in the same habitat.

the ancient crustaceans are a great model to investigate horizontal te transfer  in eukaryotes. many of them have big genome sizes and are thus likely to harbor high te contents  <cit> . decapod crustaceans, for instance, have genome sizes range from  <dig>  gb to  <dig> gb . they have ample opportunities to intimately connect with fishes, mollusks and other animas that also inhabit in fresh or salty water. furthermore, this connection is much less disturbed by geographical isolation when compared to land animals. therefore, crustaceans may at least have some sequences that show higher similarity to other aquatic animals than land arthropods. however, one big drawback is that the whole genome sequencing projects of most crustaceans are not finished yet. even though, next generation sequencing has made available more comprehensive transcriptome sequences for many crustaceans . and htts detected in transcriptome are of particular importance: they are still active and may still have impact on genome evolution.

in this study, we particularly focused on pacific white shrimp, litopenaeus vannamei. this species has a genome size approximately 70 % of the human genome and is likely to harbor high te content  <cit> . due to its high commercial value, extensive efforts have been made on its transcriptomics to better understand its immunity, growth and development  <cit> . we identified hundreds of reliable te fragments from an up-to-date transcriptome assembly of l. vannamei and showed that many of them are involved in htt events.

RESULTS
overview of te transcripts in l. vannamei transcriptome
we identified  <dig> te transcripts in total, all of which have transposon-related conserved domains and their actual existence could be confirmed by sequence similarity search against whole collection of l. vannamei ests and nucleotides . furthermore, we ensured that they are not transcripts of single/low copy genes that happened to contain te-related domains, e.g., the l. vannamei elongation factor  <dig>  mrna contains a conserved domain that is a member of the tetm_like subfamily , which are typically found on mobile genetic elements. of the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> could be identified as transcripts of retrotransposons,  <dig> of which were further identified as non-ltr retrotransposon transcripts . the corresponding superfamilies of non-ltr retrotransposon transcripts were also more diverse than ltr retrotransposon transcripts. two hundred thirty transcripts could be identified as transcripts of already known l. vannamei te families. it should be noted that two families, gypsy-3_lva-ltr and penelope-6_lva, were not consistent with their identified superfamilies. this is possibly the results of nested tes , especially for the corresponding transcript of gypsy-3_lva-ltr, which contains a conserved rt-nltr domain and consequently resulted in the identification of superfamily as rte.table  <dig> classification of  <dig> te transcripts in l. vannamei transcriptome




l. vannamei te transcripts showed high similarity to nucleotide sequences from distantly related aquatic species
by querying against ncbi blast nucleotide database, we found that  <dig> transcripts had significant hits . the taxa of organisms present in top hits were extracted and counted. in total,  <dig> taxa were used to distinguish different species and evaluate their relationships. as shown is table  <dig>  arthropods were the most frequent top hits, followed by ray-finned fishes  and mollusks. species in cnidaria, nematoda and platyhelminthes, many of which are well known parasites, were also present in top hits with considerable number. overall speaking, species from top hits represented a wide range of taxa, but most of them either also live in salty/fresh water or are potential parasites. exceptions come from plants, mammals and birds; however, their frequencies as top hits are very low. it is noteworthy that as many as  <dig> transcripts showed high similarity to sequences from viruses. further analysis revealed that they are actually all transcripts of penelope-1_lva, which contains fragments of white spot syndrome virus . wssv is one of the most fatal threats to shrimp farming throughout the globe  <cit> ; therefore, future studies on this te family might afford novel perspective for antiviral research.table  <dig> taxa of te transcripts’ top hits in querying against ncbi blast nucleotide database




most transcripts that match to arthropods in top place were transcripts of non-ltr retrotransposons, especially the rte superfamilies, while those match to ray-finned fishes and mollusks in top place were mainly transcripts of ltr retrotransposons. the overall transcripts of l. vannamei, however, are mainly arthropod conservative  <cit> . a simplest explanation for this phylogenetic incongruence is that transcripts which matched non-arthropod species in top place are involved in htts. of  <dig> such transcripts,  <dig> could be identified as transcripts of already known l. vannamei te families. there are  <dig> such te families in total, which were used to query the ncbi blast chromosome and htgs databases in order to find presence of their homologues in genomes of other species. as shown in table  <dig>  for query sequences that have significant hits, their top hits were also mostly from aquatic species. yet it should be noted that query coverage was very low for every query sequence, making it impossible to get nucleotide homologues long enough for phylogenetic analyses. furthermore, nearly half of the  <dig> te families did not have significant hits. these suggest that the common ancestors of the  <dig> te families and their homologues have diverged greatly among species. consequently, the top hits of te families may not be their nearest neighbor in phylogenies  <cit>  and stronger evidences of htt are needed.table  <dig> top hits of 16 l. vannamei te families in querying against chromosome and htgs databases

phylogenetic incongruence of tes are closely linked with ecological relationships among species
to tackle the above problem, we used the protein sequences of 10 l. vannamei te families  to query the ncbi blast protein database, in order to find hits with higher query coverage . phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood method was conducted for each query sequence and its significant hits . we used fasttree and raxml  to infer phylogenetic trees  <cit> . both methods gave similar topologies around l. vannamei sequences. only nimb-2_lva and rte-3_lva have different closest neighbors between the two methods. of the 10 l. vannamei te families, seven were most closely related to non-arthropod aquatic animals and only three were most closely related to insects . in addition to further confirming that many l. vannamei te families are involved in htt events, there are also more interesting details.table  <dig> protein sequences of 10 l. vannamei te families used for blastp search




for example in fig.  <dig>  many parasites were present in the tree, which indicate that parasitism might play important roles in htt. still, it may not be indispensable: in fig.  <dig>  there is no parasite at all; the close relationship between bees  and mung bean  could not be explained by parasitism , either. aquatic animals tend to group together. however, many of them are actually very distant to each other in evolution : purple sea urchin  and bony fishes  have diverged for at least  <dig> million years  <cit> ; saccoglossus kowalevskii, pacific oyster , hydrozoans , stony corals , sea anemones  and priapulus caudatus also represent a wide range of taxa . for te families whose closest neighbors were arthropods, they also had relatively close neighbors of distantly related species , indicating that their homologues might still involve in htt events. another point is that microorganisms were also widely present in trees . actually, microorganisms are important donors of horizontally transferred materials found in animals  <cit> . here, we conclude that microorganisms and parasites might play similar roles in htt events: important, yet not indispensable.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of bel-1_lva-i and its homologues. local support values are only shown for those nodes with support values no less than  <dig> . organism names of respective sequences are colored according to their ecological habit or taxonomy; detailed information of the classified terms could be found in table 5

overall speaking, organisms with close ecological relationships tend to group together, even being distantly related in taxonomy. when referring to ecological relationships, we should not overlook the fact that l. vannamei and other aquatic species formed a huge food web in water. therefore, predation among species might greatly facilitate htts, either through exchange of parasites and microorganisms, or through direct flow of dna. after all, naked dna and rna can circulate in animal bodily fluids  <cit> . the huge amounts of tes may also ensure their success of passing through a digestive system and other barriers.

it has been proposed that htts among plants might provide an escape route from silencing and elimination and are thus essential for tes’ survival in plants  <cit> . yet on the other hand, the acquisition of foreign genes by horizontal transfer may enhance the evolutionary potential of the recipient lineage  <cit> . although the expansions of tes look like selfish and parasitic, tes are actually important drivers of genome evolution: they can provide raw material for novel genes and contribute to regulation and generation of allelic diversity  <cit> . in this study, the frequent exchange of tes between l. vannamei and other aquatic species may also provide some evolutionary advantages for them.

htt involved transcripts might play important roles in antiviral immunity
to elucidate whether tes, especially tes involved in htt events, have any biological functions, we analyzed the expression level of all transcripts in two ncbi bioprojects:  transcriptome of five early stages in l. vannamei, namely embryo, nauplius, zoe, mysis and postlarvae; and  haemocyte transcriptome of l. vannamei after the successive stimulation of recombinant vp <dig>  vp <dig> is known as one of the major envelope proteins of wssv and is likely to play a key role in the initial steps of the systemic wssv infection in shrimp  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  te/htt and overall transcripts showed different expression patterns in both bioprojects : in early developmental stages, the proportion of differentially expressed te/htt transcripts is generally lower than that of overall transcripts  ; while in response to vp <dig> stimulation, the proportion of differentially expressed te/htt transcripts is consistently higher than that of overall transcripts . evidently, even te/htt transcripts may have some roles in early development, their effects would be diluted in overall transcripts; on the other hand, their possible roles in antiviral immunity are likely to be enriched. using one-class support vector machines  models  <cit> , we predicted transcripts that showed similar expression pattern to htt transcripts in both bioprojects. during early developmental stages, nine transcripts showed similar expression pattern to htt transcripts; however, none of them have significant blastx hits , making it impossible to deduce their possible functions. under vp <dig> stimulation,  <dig> transcripts showed similar expression pattern to htt transcripts, of which seven have significant blastx hits with ascertained biological functions . transcripts listed in table  <dig>  are not likely to be direct immune genes, yet their fundamental roles must be indispensable in antiviral immunity   <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression profile of overall transcripts, te transcripts and htt transcripts. raw sequencing reads of two ncbi bioprojects were aligned and counted: transcriptome of five early stages in l. vannamei  and haemocyte transcriptome of l. vannamei after the successive stimulation of recombinant vp <dig> . the threshold of differential expression represents the max fold change of transcript read counts among different experimental groups





the injection of vp <dig> into shrimp has been proved to increase their resistance to invasive wssv  <cit> . go enrichment analysis  indicated that the successive vp <dig> stimulation could modulate cytoskeleton integration and redox to promote the phagocytosis activity of shrimp haemocytes  <cit> . apart from up-regulation of antiviral genes, the down-regulation of some other functional genes may also be helpful. for example, the small gtp-binding protein rab <dig>  is a vp28-binding protein  <cit> . injection of vp <dig> down-regulated the expression of rab <dig> gene , which is in accordance with previous finding that suppression of rab <dig> inhibits wssv  infection in shrimp  <cit> . to elucidate more exact roles of te/htt transcripts, we further analyzed the expression level of overall/te/htt transcripts in different experimental groups: blank , control , single vp <dig>  and successive vp <dig>   <cit> . two thresholds of differential expression were selected: at the threshold of  <dig>  the whole collection of a transcript set  will be included; at the threshold of  <dig>  it means the max fold change of any transcript among different experimental groups exceeds  <dig>  at the threshold of  <dig>  the mean values of expression levels varied, but no statistical significance  was found in any transcript set. this is in accordance with the hypothesis that most genes are not differentially expressed  <cit>  . at the threshold of  <dig>  on the other hand, the expression level of htt transcripts in successive vp <dig> group was significantly lower than other groups . furthermore, at the threshold of  <dig>  there are  <dig> htt transcripts, seven of which contain fragments of wssv . taken together, we suggest that the down-regulation of htt transcripts in vp <dig> stimulation is not likely to be an incidental or side effect, but reflect their potential inhibitory roles in antiviral immunity.fig.  <dig> average read counts of transcripts in different experimental groups. the bioproject is the haemocyte transcriptome of l. vannamei after the successive stimulation of recombinant vp <dig>  the threshold of differential expression is  <dig>  which indicates that whole collection of overall transcripts , te transcripts  and htt transcripts  are included. error bars represent se; no significant difference exists between any two groups

CONCLUSIONS
although the number of presumptive horizontally transferred genes is increasing, the exact role of ht/htt in the evolution of unicellular eukaryotes is still blurry. our knowledge about the underlying mechanism is even more limited. in this study, we found that in l. vannamei, an ancient crustacean, a considerable number of transcripts are also involved in htt events. nearly all of the htt transcripts are transcripts of retrotransposons, which is in accordance with previous findings. phylogenetic analyses revealed that l. vannamei tes are often most close to tes from aquatic species. furthermore, tes from other aquatic species, the taxonomic relationship among which are often very far away, also tend to group together. we suggest that htt events might frequently occur among species that have close ecological relationships, the underlying impetus of which might be predation among those species. through analyses of expression profile, we found that te/htt transcripts are more likely to play important roles in antiviral immunity, and they might actually act as inhibitors of antiviral immunity.
