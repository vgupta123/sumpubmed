BACKGROUND
most genetic research is aimed ultimately at understanding how phenotypes are produced. this is complicated by the fact that genes interact with the environment and other genes in producing phenotypes, such that the phenotypic effect of mutating any single gene depends on the allele status at secondary loci as well as environmental variables  <cit> . large-scale phenotypic analysis of combinations of genetic and environmental variations  has proven useful for understanding the organization of gene networks  <cit> . however, analysis of gene interactions is not tractable in humans due to their outbred nature and phenotypic complexity  <cit> , thus genetically tractable model systems can provide new inroads for understanding genotype-phenotype complexity of human disease pathways  <cit> . in this regard, the collection of  <dig> yeast gene deletion strains provides a unique resource for systematic analysis of gene interactions by comparing cell proliferation phenotypes  of the wt strain and each deletion mutant under various perturbation conditions  <cit> .

most large-scale phenotypic analyses of the yeast gene deletion strains have been non-or semi-quantitative, based on end-point analysis of cell proliferation  <cit> . on a smaller scale, quantitative analysis of gene interactions has proven advantageous by virtue of being more objective, sensitive, and discriminating between strength of interactions, which can aid identification of distinct pathways represented within large sets of interacting genes  <cit> . precise quantitative phenotyping together with kinetic analysis of cell proliferation can reveal differential genetic regulation of distinct physiological phases of growth  <cit> . ideally, htcp would have sufficient throughput and quantitative accuracy for investigating genotype-phenotype complexity with respect to many dimensions including time, different kinetic features of cell proliferation, gene-gene and gene-environment perturbation combinations, and gradients of perturbation intensity. these dimensions may be critical to parse gene networks functionally.

turbidity readings of liquid cultures are the current standard for kinetic analysis of microbial cell proliferation  <cit> . however, throughput is greatly reduced, relative to endpoint analysis of agar spotted arrays, or the use of dna microarray hybridization methods  <cit> . throughput is lower for kinetic vs. endpoint analysis because ~ <dig> time points of data are taken for each culture. furthermore, liquid arrays are more difficult to analyze than solid arrays due to shaking requirements for resuspending cells prior to each reading, and increased time for operation of a microplate reader vs. visual inspection. precision of kinetic turbidity readings is limited by spilling, cross contamination, and evaporation, which hinders miniaturization and automation of liquid culture-based htcp. phenotypic array analysis , an alternative quantitative htcp approach based on time-lapse imaging and image analysis of agar spotted cell arrays, improves throughput to ~ <dig> – <dig>  measurements per hour  <cit> , taking advantage of the easy handling and potential for rapid imaging of agar cell arrays. this work describes yeastxtract, an image analysis software application that improves paa, so that early phase kinetic growth rates can be measured, analogous to od readings of liquid cultures. validation experiments are presented for yeastxtract. additionally, the logistic growth equation was used for kinetic modeling of cell proliferation data and shown to offer advantages over empirical growth models for quantifying cell proliferation phenotypes from time series images. together, these methods are intended to improve htcp capacity for global, quantitative analysis of gene interactions using large microbial mutant collections.

RESULTS
yeastxtract image analysis software
yeastxtract is a software application that analyzes time series images of yeast cell arrays, for the purpose of kinetic growth curve analysis, and can be used on operating systems with the java platform installed. from the yeastxtract user interface, a sequence of images is selected using a 'browse' function, and automated analysis is initiated by selecting the "start analysis" button. after analysis is complete, the enumerated intensities and areas of culture spots are displayed. time-lapse images of individual spot cultures, along with plotted growth curves can be accessed via the 'spot level information' tab. accuracy of spot detection can be checked using the 'spot detection' function which depicts the ellipses used to quantify biomass of each culture on the cell array image. a user manual with screenshots depicting how these functions are accessed from the user interface is provided as . the software executables, source code, and sample images are available for download  <cit>  and use under the creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike  <dig>  license  <cit> . the software has a modular design to facilitate modification and further development. an overview of the analysis algorithm is provided below, with a detailed description in methods.

up to ten cell arrays are imaged at a time, using an optical scanner , as previously described  <cit> . each cell array time series is analyzed individually . images from a time series are aligned in reverse-chronological order using a least squares algorithm. the final time point is used for spot detection , and the resulting 'grid' is used for spot extraction from aligned images . spot detection is performed in two steps. first, the approximate center of each spot is determined from local maxima of summed pixel columns and rows . second, the pixel columns and rows in each cell of the resulting grid are analyzed to identify the horizontal and vertical diameters of each spot, from which an ellipse is calculated . for signal extraction, the background of each spot is computed from a localized mean around the mode of pixel intensities outside the ellipse, and then subtracted from intensities of each pixel inside the ellipse . total pixel intensity is calculated for each time-point, and the intensities are plotted vs. time . the pixel area of each ellipse is calculated in order to normalize spot intensities against spot size.

yeastxtract provides accuracy and precision for image analysis of agar culture arrays comparable to optical density readings of liquid cultures
the original aim of this study was to increase the sensitivity for detecting spotted cell cultures to reach the range and accuracy of microplate readers for kinetic growth analysis. our previous image analysis programs did not have the sensitivity to measure specific growth rates when they were in their maximal steady state  <cit> . spot detection and local background subtraction were implemented to increase accuracy and precision of intensity measures. background subtraction is also useful for modeling growth phenomena, since the background is non-biological and can contribute substantially  to the final spot intensity.

particle size analysis  was used to determine the correlation between biomass  of a spot and its spot intensity measurement . a gradient of dilutions  of an overnight culture were spotted onto a 96-culture array. after  <dig> hours, the array was imaged  and all cultures were immediately excised and subjected to particle size analysis. after image analysis, spot intensities were plotted vs. total cell volume . the densest culture spots had intensity of about  <dig>  ×  <dig> pixels , and contained approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cells having a total cellular volume of ~ <dig> ×  <dig> fl. including average pixel intensity background of ~ <dig>  the average spot culture pixel intensity was approximately  <dig>  thus, given the pixel intensity of 8-bit images ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  final spot intensities reach only ~65% image saturation. linear regression of image intensity vs. biomass  of spot cultures revealed a high degree of correlation . total cell volume had slightly higher linear correlation than cell number , due to a slight reduction in median cell size as cultures approached their final population density . it can be concluded from fig.  <dig> that paa-derived spot intensities are comparable to od measurements of liquid cultures, with respect to accuracy and precision for quantifying cell proliferation.

four microliters of culture suspension is typically used for spotting cultures, giving rise to a spot area of approximately  <dig> pixels  on a  <dig> ×  <dig> pixel array . spot cultures are detected when the average pixel intensity is approximately one . a constant exponential rate of growth is observed over 4– <dig> generation times . the final population intensity , reflecting total growth efficiency when resources for cell proliferation are exhausted, is typically  around 100– <dig>  tmr  is the time it takes a culture to reach its maximum growth rate . thus, the difference in tmr between two-fold dilutions of a culture approximates the minimum doubling time . shifting 2-fold diluted cultures by tmr yields overlapping growth curves .

normalization of spot intensity by spot area reduces variation in fpi and augc
an important difference between liquid and agar culture analysis is that the area of the culture spot affects the reading . hence, normalizing spot intensity data by spot area can reduce experimental noise, since spot area variation is mostly non-biological . the utility of spot area normalization was tested by intentionally varying the spot size, and normalization was found to correct almost entirely for the effect of spot size on growth curve differences . fpi reflects the carrying capacity  of a culture  <cit> . since there is variation in the areas of cultures even when equal volumes are used to print each spot, spot area normalization is needed to accurately compare growth efficiency. in summary, spot area normalization reduces variation in fpi  and augc , while not affecting msr  or tmr calculations .

a logistic function model is used to quantify cell proliferation phenotypes, such as maximum specific rate and total growth efficiency, from time series data
different attributes of growth curves represent distinct physiological phases of growth  <cit> . when a fresh culture is inoculated from a saturated, stationary culture, there is typically a 'lag' phase until the culture doubling time reaches a minimum. the population then undergoes a phase of growth during which the overall growth rate increases exponentially while the specific rate, or percent change in population with respect to time, remains constant . finally, when resources supporting growth become limiting, the growth rate decays until growth ceases and the "carrying capacity" is thus reached. these physiologically distinct characteristics of growth are potentially under the control of different genes and pathways and can thus be considered as different cell proliferation phenotypes . in this study, we focused on the following cpps:

• total growth efficiency, which is measured by the final population intensity  of a spot culture, is also referred to as the carrying capacity in the logistic equation.

• specific growth rate is the growth rate divided by the population size.

• maximum specific growth rate  is the maximum value of the specific rate over time, and is inversely proportional to the minimum doubling time of a culture.

• doubling time is the time required for the population size to double. minimum doubling time is equal to loge 2/msr.

• area under growth curve  is the integral of spot intensity curve over the interval between the first and final time point.

• time of maximum rate  corresponds to the time when the growth rate reaches its peak value; by the logistic model, tmr marks the time when half carrying capacity is reached.

• lag time is a property of the culture, whereby there is a delay after cells are introduced into a new medium before msr is achieved.

to evaluate the performance of different growth models, we considered reduction in the variation of cpp values from many replicate cultures as an increase in the precision of a model . the following form of the logistic equation was used to fit growth data:

g=k1+e−r,g<k
 mathtype@mtef@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatcvaufkttlearuwrp9mdh5mbpbiqv92aaexatlxbi9gbaebbnrfifhhdyfgasaach8aky=wiffydh8gipec8eeeu0xxdbba9frfj0=oqffea0dxdd9vqai=hguq8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qilsfr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacagaaeqabaqabegadaaakeaacqwghbwrcqggoaakcqwg0badcqggpaqkcqgh9aqpdawcaaqaaiabduealbqaaiabigdaxiabgucariabdwgalnaacaaaleqabagaeyoei0iaemocainaeiikagiaemidaqnaeyoei0iaemibawmaeiykakcaaaaakiabcycasiabdeeahjabcicaoiabicdawiabcmcapiabgyda8iabduealbaa@44fc@

where k  is approximated by the fpi; r is the msr, and l is the tmr. we compared cpps derived from the logistic equation model, the raw data, and data fit to a spline model .

the logistic function growth model increases precision of msr and tmr measurements
median msr values were comparable, regardless of the model used for calculation , with minimum doubling times ranging between  <dig>   and  <dig>   hours. however, the variation in msr values was reduced by 63%  if calculated using spline-fit data instead of raw data . msr variation was reduced another 44%  using the logistic model . variation in the calculation of tmr was similarly improved by the spline- and logistic equation-fitted data. the likely explanation for the reduced variation in the spline-fit vs. the raw data is that growth is a continuous function, and thus fitting of the data increases precision by reducing the time interval for rate calculations. increases in measurement precision for msr and tmr with the logistic equation may stem from it being specifically designed for modeling growth phenomena  <cit> .

augc measurements were not greatly impacted by the model used. likewise, fpi, which is a dominant factor in augc calculation, is relatively unaffected by model selection . there was a trend toward lower fpi and augc with the logistic model , which was investigated by examining the nature of fpi in more detail, as described below.

an 'initial carrying capacity' is modeled by the logistic equation
the trend toward lower fpi and augc with the logistic model  was caused by underestimation of spot intensity at later times, particularly for cultures spotted on the edge of an array . it was frequently observed, in images from late time points, that spots around the edges of the array tend to have larger areas than interior-located spots. thus, we hypothesized that increases in spot intensity, if due to increases in spot area at late time points, would not be well modeled by the logistic equation. as the hypothesis goes, once the spot has grown to confluence, it reaches an 'initial carrying capacity', however due to a residuum of energy sources, cultures can continue to grow slowly . since the cultures have grown to confluence, new cells begin to become outwardly displaced, resulting in an increasing spot area. since the cultures on the edge of the array have less competition for available nutrients, the spot areas can increase more.

in fig.  <dig>  these phenomena are depicted by a time series of spot intensities for a typical edge culture, where an inflection in the growth curve occurs after initial carrying capacity is reached . fitting the data to a spline, the late increase in spot intensity is followed closely . however fitting the same data to the logistic equation, this inflection in the spot intensity curve is missed . in summary, the area of agar initially covered by cells at the time of array printing grows to confluence, reaching an "initial carrying capacity"; and further increases in spot intensities are correlated with actual increase in the size of the spot , which is not well modeled by the logistic equation.

data are filtered after the time initial carrying capacity is reached to improve modeling
to better understand the nature of the initial carrying capacity, the difference in spot area after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of growth was examined, confirming that edge cultures increase in size more than internal cultures . we next examined the growth rate with respect to time and spot area, finding that increases in spot area correspond with an inflection in the growth rate curve . thus, once spot cultures have reached their initial carrying capacity , further increases are associated with increases in the spot area, occurring preferentially at the edges of a cell array.

to improve growth curve modeling with the logistic equation, we designed a filtering algorithm to reduce the effects that increases is spot area might have after initial carrying capacity is reached, since individual cultures in an experiment might have varying growth rates due to gene deletions and/or other perturbations. since the logistic equation has the property that the maximum growth rate occurs when population is at half of carrying capacity, we used a spline to estimate the tmr and then filtered out time points having greater than  <dig>  times the spot intensity at tmr. the filtering algorithm improves fitting of data to the logistic model by reducing the tendency for artificial increases in fpi for cultures on the edge of an array .

physiological lag time can be measured directly by phenotypic array analysis
an assumption of the logistic equation is that the msr occurs at time =  <dig> . however, realistically there is a physiological lag time that occurs when a culture having approached carrying capacity, is again inoculated into fresh media conditions. the lag time is typically 1– <dig> generation times, but of variable duration. since, with paa, growth is analyzed over nearly  <dig> generations, the effect of lag on the logistic model is negligible . however, since the lag time is of biological significance and interest, we investigated use of the spline model for directly measuring the lag time from cell array images . for this experiment, the same 'overnight' starting culture was diluted either 4-fold or 2000-fold before printing to different arrays. the lag time  was ~ <dig> hours . the more highly diluted culture achieved the same msr , which was observed at the time the spot intensity breached the threshold of image detection . thus, lag time and msr can be measured together by printing arrays with low-dilution cultures.

the logistic equation-based growth model is robust against data sparseness
once it was realized that the logistic equation was an accurate model for characterizing yeast cell proliferation, it became evident that it should be more robust than the spline or raw models to data sparseness because its parameters are more constrained. to assess model stability, individual time points were randomly removed one at a time , and msr values were re-calculated from the remaining data . the accuracy and precision of the average msr value calculated from the logistic model was greater than that calculated by the spline model or using raw data .

the robustness of the cpps obtained from the logistic model likely results from the appropriateness of assumptions inherent to its equation for cell proliferation phenomena; the main assumption being that the rate of increase in biomass at any time is proportional to the biomass and the availability of resources  <cit> . a major strength of this form of the logistic equation is that its two major parameters, k and r, correlate well with fpi and msr under standard conditions for growing spotted cultures on agar media.

CONCLUSIONS
global, systematic analysis of gene interaction networks is a recent experimental paradigm for systems biology. since genetic interactions are often scored on the basis of cell proliferation measurements, htcp is an enabling technology for this field of research. yeastxtract and the growth modeling algorithms presented here, help advance htcp throughput and accuracy to enable phenotypic measurements in different dimensions such as varying intensities of perturbations, and different physiological aspects of growth responses . these advances will allow interactions to be investigated not only from the perspective of different combinations of gene and environmental/chemical perturbations, but also different aspects of the growth phenotype itself, each of which may be sculpted by different natural selective pressure for gene activities.

in a previous publication, we described phenotypic array analysis, an htcp method based on rapid imaging of ~ <dig>  spotted cultures per hour  <cit> . yeastxtract now enables automated paa, without need for manual pre-processing of images. it provides single pixel resolution, improving paa sensitivity and accuracy. while the methods were developed using yeast, and intended for application to the set of  <dig> yeast gene deletion strains, they should also be applicable to other cell types that can be grown in similar fashion as agar cell arrays. imaging and automated image analysis of cell arrays can now be incorporated into htcp-driven experimental approaches, such as for quantitative investigations of gene interaction networks  <cit> . looking forward, insight from global, quantitative analysis of gene interaction networks in single cell organisms, should be extensible for hypothesis-driven investigations of cellular pathways that buffer genetic and environmental perturbations in an orthologous fashion in multi-cellular organisms  <cit> .
