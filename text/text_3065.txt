BACKGROUND
the detection and quantification of alcohols with high selectivity and accuracy is required in many different areas. accurate and rapid measurement of ethanol is important in clinical and forensic practice to analyse human body fluids, e.g. blood, serum, saliva, urine, breath and sweat, among others. the food, beverage , and pulp industries also require simple, correct, fast, and economic analytical methods to control fermentation processes and the quality of products.

enzymatic and biosensor approaches are among the most convenient analytical methods for this purpose. yeast alcohol oxidase  has been extensively used for the determination of lower primary alcohols and formaldehyde  <cit> . significant progress in selection of optimal transducers, immobilization and stabilization of enzyme has been achieved. however, the affinity of aox to ethanol is rather high, and direct aox-based measurements of a target analyte, e.g. ethanol in real samples of wines, beers or fermentation cultures, is complicated and economically detrimental due to the necessity of diluting the samples. this is especially important in automatic electrochemical devises such as biosensors since the additional step of sample dilution causes significantly increasing costs of analysis. in order to overcome this inconvenience, obtaining modified forms of aox with decreased affinity towards substrates and a wide range of linear response is highly desirable.

in this work, we report on the selection of methylotrophic yeast hansenula polymorpha mutants which produce modified aoxs with decreased affinities toward substrates and with maximal velocities that increased or remained unaffected. we communicate on the identification of substitutions in mutant alleles, purification of mutant aoxs, and study of applicability of the modified enzyme in amperometric biosensor development.

RESULTS
the generation, characterization, sequencing, and purification of the mutant forms of aox
for isolation of the mutant forms of aox  with decreased affinity to substrates, a positive selection procedure was developed. allyl alcohol was used as the selective agent in the medium with methanol as sole carbon and energy source. the rationale for the developed selection scheme was as follows. allyl alcohol is oxidized by aox with the formation of highly toxic acrolein. in the medium with the mixture of methanol  and allyl alcohol , mutants defective in aox could not arise. mutants producing lower amounts of acrolein and enough formaldehyde for growth could be selected. one of the reasons for such an event would be the decrease of affinity of aox toward substrates while retaining high enough reaction velocity. this selection scheme would produce few or no mutants with decreased rate of aox reaction as they would not grow efficiently due to the negligible amount of formaldehyde produced. altogether,  <dig> mutants of h. polymorpha strain dl-1- <dig> that were able to growth on allyl alcohol containing medium were chosen for further selection. mutants with decreased enzyme affinity towards ethanol were screened by a plate colony assay as described in the material and methods section. finally, two positive colonies  which stained in the presence of  <dig> mm ethanol, but not  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm, were selected.

the kinetic parameters of aox from the selected mutant strains were evaluated. km values towards methanol for the parental strain and the ca <dig> and ca <dig> mutants were calculated as  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mm, respectively . at the same time, vmax of aox from the fore mentioned strains was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol of atomic o·min-1·mg- <dig> of protein at 20°c, respectively . thus, allyl alcohol/methanol-based selection is suitable for obtaining h. polymorpha mutants with decreased aox substrate affinity and without decreased maximal velocity of the specific enzyme reaction.

* a relatively low value of linear regression coefficient r for reciprocal plot for ca2-aox can be explained by decreased activity measured and with accordingly increased error value

mutant alleles of aox gene from ca <dig> and ca <dig> strains were cloned and sequenced. nucleotide sequences of the mutant alleles were translated into amino acid sequences and compared with that of the wild-type strain . several amino acid substitutions were identified which apparently cause decreased affinity towards ethanol. it was found that each mutant allele contains numerous substitutions . one can note that the number of point mutations within the mutant alleles is rather high. however, it should be emphasized that the colonies of allyl-alcohol resistant mutants were stored on a selective medium for several weeks up to month. this allowed for the gradual accumulation of several favourable mutations for growth of mutants on allyl alcohol/methanol containing medium. in the other words, natural selection in allyl alcohol/methanol resistant mutants occurred by the accumulation of successive spontaneous or acrolein induced mutations.

both strains are shown to have i > v substitutions in position  <dig> and t > s in position  <dig>  in addition, the aox sequence of ca <dig> strain has amino acid substitutions i > v , e > k , p > l , k > r , n > d , f > s , and w > r . the mutant protein in strain ca <dig> has a lower substitution number which includes: i > v , p > s , m > v , and l > p . the level of the substrate affinity reduction correlates with the average quantity of amino acid substitutions.

the aoxs were purified. samples of ca <dig> and ca <dig> maoxs as well as native aox  were obtained with quantities close to  <dig> mg with specific activities of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μmol·min-1·mg- <dig>  respectively. the average yield of chromatographically pure aox samples was close to 20% of the initial amount . homogeneity of the resulting proteins was confirmed by electrophoresis. the molecular weights of mutant proteins, according to sds-page electrophoresis data, are close to that of the natural protein  <cit> . purified enzymes were used for construction of an amperometric biosensor.

*  <dig> unit is equal  <dig> μmol of converted substrate per  <dig> min at standard conditions of assay .

bioanalytic characterization of an amperometric biosensor based on a mutant form of aox
an amperometric biosensor based on maox  and peroxidase , architected as hrp/os-ap59//aox/cp <dig>  was constructed according to  <cit> . characterisation of the enzymatic properties of maox was performed using naox as a reference. the typical dynamic ranges for aox-modified sensors to ethanol are presented in figure  <dig> 

in addition to alcohols , formaldehyde is also a substrate for aox  <cit> . the calibration curves of the biosensors response to ethanol and formaldehyde clearly show the lower affinities toward both substrates of maox compared to wild-type enzyme .

as was mentioned before, the natural and mutant forms of aox were shown to differ in km value towards methanol in solution: the mutant enzyme possesses 4-fold increased km value and, thus, decreased substrate affinity . the results obtained by use of the aox-immobilised amperometric sensor show good agreement with those obtained with aoxs in solution. thus, the km value of a naox-immobilised electrode were  <dig>  mm towards ethanol and  <dig>  mm towards formaldehyde, whereas these values for the maox-immobilised electrode were increased to  <dig>  mm towards ethanol and  <dig>  mm towards formaldehyde. these results also show that mutant aoxs have a decreased affinity not only to the physiological substrate methanol, but also to other substrates, such as ethanol and formaldehyde. it is interesting to note that the imax values for ethanol and formaldehyde of naox/maox-immobilised electrodes were  <dig> / <dig>  na and  <dig> / <dig>  na, respectively. the imax values of the constructed sensors did not differ significantly . otherwise the linear dynamic range of the maox-immobilised electrode to ethanol arranged  <dig> mm vs  <dig>  mm for naox-immobilised electrodes .

the study of operational stability and inactivation kinetics of the constructed biosensors revealed that the sensors based on either mutant or natural enzymes are very similar . both sensors retained 50% of their activity after  <dig> h of continuous exploitation. the storage stability for both constructed biosensors was better than  <dig> days with 50% current drop after  <dig> days of storage .

thus, the constructed amperometric biosensor based on maox  was characterised by decreased affinity towards analyzed substrates without altered operational stability of the sensor.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we describe a novel selection procedure for isolation of the mutant forms of aox, and their use as a suitable bioelement for biosensor technologies. the created biosensor based on maox  was characterised by a decreased affinity towards analyzed substrates and slightly increased vmax. furthermore, the operational stability of the maox-immobilised electrode was not affected and remained similar to an electrode based on the natural enzyme. the described methodology opens up the possibility for construction of biosensors appropriate for precise, rapid, and cheap analysis of target analytes, e.g. ethanol in real samples of wines, beers or fermentation cultures. for further improvement of maox as a biosensor element, various strategies could be used: 1) direct design of mutant forms of aox based on results obtained from site-specific mutagenesis; 2) evolutionary engineering of mutant forms of aox through continuous cultivation of the corresponding strains in medium with increased concentrations of allyl alcohol; 3) determination of crystal structures of an aox of h. polymorpha, elucidation of the structural bases involved in the enzyme-substrate interaction and subsequent direct modification of enzyme characteristics.
