BACKGROUND
bacillus anthracis, a spore forming gram positive bacteria, is the etiological agent of anthrax, a zoonosis with a worldwide distribution. the disease can be transmitted to humans by contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. in addition to being an occupational disease, limited to farmers and veterinarians, anthrax has received considerable attention and is one of the most feared microorganism with respect to bioterrorism. in  <dig>  letters containing spores were mailed causing the death of five persons and several cases of cutaneous anthrax  <cit> . b. anthracis is a member of the bacillus cereus group, containing bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus mycoides and b. anthracis  <cit> . b. anthracis is characterized by an extremely low genetic variability, making strains differentiation very challenging  <cit> . the importance of strain differentiation of biothreat agents including b. anthracis is increasingly recognized as a way for identifying the source of the attack, as illustrated not only by the  <dig> events but also, earlier on, by the sverdlovsk  <cit>  and tokyo  <cit>  events. such events together suggested how crucial is the development of microbial forensics for biosecurity. measures aimed at limiting the risk of deliberate release of dangerous pathogens, would require that isolates kept in different institutions around the world are precisely genotyped, and that the genotype profiles are shared by all countries having accepted to follow these rules, for strain accountability purposes.

because the molecular methods classically used to differentiate between strains in other species failed to discriminate b. anthracis isolates, new approaches were developed. using amplified fragment length polymorphism in  <dig> b. anthracis isolates,  <dig> polymorphic chromosomal regions were observed out of  <dig>  fragments, and eventually, the most interesting polymorphisms turned out to be the result of tandem repeat variations  <cit> . tandem repeats variability was studied most extensively in eukaryotes, and was shown to be associated with different aspects of dna replication and recombination, including replication slippage and double-strand breaks repair  <cit> . they do not vary by the same mechanisms which are inducing point mutations, and the mutation rate at some variable number of tandem repeats  loci may be considerably higher than nucleotide substitutions  <cit>  in an as yet not predictable way  <cit> . the level of intraspecific polymorphism in tandemly repeated sequences varies from one locus to another and needs to be experimentally measured by typing representative strain collections. approaches based on vntr analysis  are now increasingly used to characterize in particular recently emerged, highly monomorphic pathogens including b. anthracis  <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , yersinia pestis  <cit> brucella  <cit>  . multiple alleles can exist in the population for each tandem repeat locus. one advantage of mlva typing as compared for instance to snp  typing is that a new isolate can be compared to previously characterised strains in an unbiased way. one weakness is that the phylogenetic value of mlva clustering must be carefully checked and validated by using independent approaches with less homoplastic markers  <cit> . in previous reports, a multilocus vntr analysis  method was proposed for genotyping of b. anthracis strains, using six chromosomal and two plasmid marker loci . in the initial work, an automated fluorescent dna sequencer was used to determine the size of the pcr fragments and this set of markers is now largely employed for b. anthracis genotyping  <cit> . however, this mlva <dig> assay is not sufficient for molecular forensics approaches, the resolution achieved is too limited. for instance the vast majority of french and italian strains have been assigned to mlva <dig> genotypes   <dig> and  <dig> which differ only at one marker, located on one of the two virulence plasmids  <cit> . for this reason, additional markers were subsequently developed to produce an mlva <dig> panel  <cit> , and the initial clustering nomenclature  <cit>  was revised  <cit> . unfortunately none of the corresponding data has been published so far. le flèche et al.  <cit>  extended the mlva <dig> assay by proposing  <dig> additional markers , which greatly improved the resolution power of the assay. dna fragment sizing was achieved on standard agarose gels stained by ethidium bromide, a technique utilising widely accessible, and very basic, equipment.

in order to have a more rapid and accurate genotyping system for b. anthracis we propose an automated capillary based method using essentially the panel of loci described by le flèche et al  <cit> , with the addition of  <dig> new markers, and apply the method to collections of strains from italy and france. we compare the clustering achieved with available epidemiological data for b. anthracis, and introduce two new b. anthracis groups, d and e. the present report deals with the standardization and further improvement of currently available genotyping methods for b. anthracis, the typing of a larger collection of strains, the comparison with available published data, and the enlargement of the publicly accessible databases.

RESULTS
mlva <dig> genotyping by capillary electrophoresis
a collection of  <dig> b. anthracis isolates, comprising strains from italy and france and a few reference strains were analyzed to generate mlva typing data. dna was amplified in  <dig> multiplex pcr reactions, comprising  <dig> loci. the loci are  <dig> markers described previously  <cit>  , and the four new markers bams <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . all twenty-five markers can be amplified in only four pcr reactions by taking into account the allele size range for each locus . the labelled amplicons were separated on a ceq  <dig> beckmann dna analysis system and the electropherograms were analysed by ceq fragment analysis system software to determine the length of the fragments by reference to a 75– <dig> bps size ladder . after testing several primer concentrations and ratios, a balanced level of fluorescence peak intensity was obtained by using between  <dig> to  <dig> ng of template dna per multiplex pcr reaction and the concentration of primers indicated .

the assay was highly reproducible as tested by performing duplicate typings. the intra-experimental  as well as the inter-experimental  variation of fragment sizing showed variations lower than one base over the whole range of pcr fragments investigated here. the accuracy of the data was determined by comparison of observed pcr fragment size to the exact values calculated by direct sequencing and available genome sequence data  <cit> . in some instances the amplicon size determined after electrophoresis separation did not match the expected values . this is well illustrated for instance with bams <dig>  for which the offset increases with allele size, i.e. repeat copy number. in any case, the offset is conserved, reproducible, and the differences in calculated allele size are consistent with a  <dig> bp repeat unit variation.

because bams <dig> was initially identified as a  <dig> bp repeat unit marker  <cit> , we investigated representative bams <dig> alleles by sequencing  in order to clarify this discrepancy. sequence data indicates that bams <dig> alleles are composed of  <dig> base-pair units at one end of the array, and  <dig> bp units at the other end. table 4a provides the allele codes of bams <dig> alleles. repeat units are not identical, different letters are used to code the different variant units which are observed  <cit> . uppercase letters code for 27-base-pair repeat units whereas lowercase letters code for  <dig> base-pair repeat unit. the correspondence between letters and repeat units is indicated in table 4b. the two regions are variable, and as a result the locus behaves like a  <dig> bp repeat unit tandem repeat.

to better understand the origin of this behaviour, we investigated the structure of this locus in the closely related b. cereus-b. thuringiensis group by taking advantage of available genome sequences. figure  <dig> shows the organization of the locus in the genomes of b. anthracis , b. cereus atcc <dig> , b. cereus g <dig>  <cit> , b. cereus atcc <dig> , b. cereus e33l , and b. thuringiensis ceb97/ <dig>  also called bt <dig>  the gene bearing bams <dig> in b. anthracis  possess a collagen-like helix repeat and is flanked by two genes ba <dig> and ba <dig>  their homologues in the other strains were depicted using the same code. the organization in b. cereus g <dig> is similar to b. anthracis, but in all four other strains, the situation is less simple. in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  two genes possessing a collagen-like helix repeat protein are observed, instead of one in b. anthracis: both genes possess a tandem repeat with similarity to bams <dig>  encoding the collagen-like repeat. whereas in atcc  <dig>  the two tandem repeats have nine base-pair repeat units, bt9727- <dig> contains a  <dig> bp repeat unit presumably derived from an ancestral  <dig> bp unit. bt <dig> is by far the closest b. anthracis neighbor among the  <dig> sequenced strains  <cit> . the composite organization of the bams <dig> tandem repeat in b. anthracis can be explained by a rearrangement occurring in a bt9727-type bams <dig> locus. strain "a1055", which is closest to the last common b. anthracis ancestor  <cit>  shows the same rearrangement, which strengthens the validity of bams <dig> as an interesting complementary tool for the identification of b. anthracis  even if the rearrangement is not strictly limited to b. anthracis as shown by the g <dig> strain situation.

correspondance with agarose gel assignments
for reasons including accessibility to the different technologies, it is important to ensure that allele assignments deduced from agarose gel or capillary electrophoresis are compatible, so that the different methods can be used. for this purpose, allele sizes  previously estimated by agarose gel were re-examined according to the capillary fragment analysis and available sequence data. for bams <dig>  one allele, previously estimated at  <dig> bps  by agarose gel analysis, was corrected to  <dig> bps corresponding to  <dig> u, by capillary electrophoresis. bams <dig> turned out to vary like a 9-mer rather than 18-mer repeat unit and two alleles were resolved  and  <dig> bps for  <dig> u, previously grouped with  <dig> bps ,  <dig> bps  or  <dig> bps . for bams <dig>  one allele was resolved by capillary electrophoresis .

for markers included in the mlva <dig> assay  <cit>  which could be typed on agarose  the data obtained here were in agreement with results generated by agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit> . published mlva <dig>  <cit>  data contains some allele size assignments which do not correspond to the actual size. this is due to clerical errors in the initial report  <cit> , as noticed previously  <cit>  and data for some loci must be converted as described in the material and methods section in order to be fully compatible.

four new markers have been included. for bams <dig>  a 39-mer repeat marker, five alleles were described ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bps . bams <dig>  and bams <dig>  show two alleles ). a third allele is predicted from genome sequence data for the "western" strain, but was not experimentally observed among the collection investigated here. for bams <dig>  four alleles were observed ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bps .

data analysis
when the eight markers comprising the mlva <dig> assay are used,  <dig> different genotypes are resolved among the  <dig> isolates. with only few exceptions, these genotypes correspond to previously published profiles. most exceptions are minor variations of previous types. the vast majority of french and italian isolates belong to gt <dig> and gt <dig> within cluster a1a  <cit>  in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . when the whole mlva <dig> dataset is used,  <dig> genotypes are resolved. isolates which are not resolved in this analysis have the same epidemiological history . the clustering analysis is shown in figure  <dig>  although mlva is not by its very nature a tool with a high phylogenetic value per se, especially when the available strains do not fully cover the species diversity, the clustering achieved is in excellent agreement with the known relationship between the ancestral c type , the b cluster , and the a cluster . more precisely, the "vollum" strain  and the "australia94" strain  are in the expected position with respect to the a group.

genotypes 55– <dig>  and 57– <dig> are loosely connected to the others, and are suggested by clustering analysis as being intermediates between the b cluster and the a cluster. this position is reminiscent of the position occupied by strains "6", "7" and "8" investigated by pearson et al.  <cit> . it may be of interest to note that "6" which branched out in an ancestral position compared to the whole "a" cluster in the snp analysis  <cit> , originates from zambia, whereas genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> in figure  <dig> are from cameroon. we propose to call these very distinct mlva groups types d and e .

discussion
bacillus anthracis genotyping is essential for epidemiological studies and for biosecurity related  issues  <cit> . current methodologies such as mlva <dig> are not sufficient to discriminate two geographically close isolates in natural outbreaks, since for instance most french and italian isolates will be classified as gt <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> . molecular characterization needs to be as precise as possible in order to discriminate isolates. the rational of this work was to update the mlva method for quick  and accurate discrimination of bacillus anthracis isolates. the markers are stable, this is indirectly illustrated by the typing of "sterne" strains from different origins. genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to respectively two and five "sterne" strains. genotype  <dig> are the cip  reference strains  <dig> and  <dig>  genotype  <dig> covers "sterne" vaccine strains from different countries, and the sequenced genome. the only difference in the two genotypes is for locus bams <dig> .

the number of vntr loci was increased from  <dig> to  <dig> by addition of four new markers . the overall assay was converted from  <dig> monoplex pcr reactions, run on agarose gels and checked for size by eye or by using gel image analysis software, to  <dig> multiplex pcr analysed by automated capillary based fluorescent electrophoresis and internal size standard measurement for allele calculation. for most loci, accurate size estimate is achieved directly by the capillary electrophoresis machine. in other instances however, the sizing proposed by the machine, although quite reproducible, does not correspond to the real size. this could be due to the nature of the gel matrix, or to differences during migration between labelled pcr fragments and the ladder used, but most probably by a slightly biased flanking sequence or repeat unit-specific mobility pattern. usually, the size estimate is shifted by a constant value  but in some instances, the offset increases with increasing allele size . for this reason, allele numbering must be done carefully, using a correspondence table as presented here in table  <dig>  if different equipments, or reagents, are used, the correspondence indicated here must be checked by typing a number of reference strains , before alleles can be confidently called and data can be merged.

size measurement from multiplexed, automated pcr products allows for single-day isolate genotyping which is of importance in a crisis situation. it also provides a slightly increased discrimination power as compared to the mlva <dig> assay run on agarose gels for the same analysed markers. this difference is essentially due to the lack of resolution of agarose for the larger,  <dig> bp repeat unit loci, such as bams <dig> and for bams <dig>  bams <dig>  bams <dig> and bams <dig> typing, where new alleles were identified. for bams <dig> and bams <dig>  capillary resolution was able to show a  <dig> bps repeat unit length variation instead of the respectively  <dig> bps and  <dig> unit length proposed initially.

the present investigation suggests that a recombination event at the bams <dig> locus may have occurred prior to the emergence of b. anthracis. the event directly affects genes coding for constituents of the exosporium. bc <dig> is related to bcla, and bc <dig> corresponds to the exosporium h gene exsh  <cit> . in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  b. thuringiensis 97/ <dig>  and b. cereus genome e33l, an additional orf is located within the region. the bams30-containing gene in b. anthracis is the result of a recombination between bt9727- <dig>  and bt9727- <dig> . the beginning and the end of the protein sequence coded by ba <dig> are respectively identical to the beginning of bt9727- <dig> and to the end of bt9727- <dig>  interestingly, a similar rearrangement is observed independently in the b. cereus strain g <dig> which caused an anthrax like disease in a human patient  <cit> . as a result of this fusion, the first part of the tandem repeat itself contains a  <dig> bp repeat unit whereas the second part is a  <dig> bp repeat tandem repeat. it may be of interest to observe that two of the most polymorphic tandem repeats in b. anthracis, bams <dig> and bams <dig>  are associated with genes coding for components of the exosporium .

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we propose an improved automated genotyping system of b. anthracis by mlva, extending the range of vntr containing markers to  <dig>  which increases the resolution power as compared to previous methods. the mlva <dig> assay was used to genotype italian and french isolates in a very fast and highly reproducible manner. we also better defined previously characterized alleles and describe new allelic variants. mlva <dig> is a very accurate and discriminatory genotyping method and could be a promising technique for future epidemiological studies as well as differentiation of deliberated vs. naturally occurring outbreaks. the improved assay and resulting data remains compatible with the initial agarose gel based assay. the genotyping data can be queried on the web page mlva web-service  <cit> . this site allows the comparison of local typing data to the data generated in this report.
