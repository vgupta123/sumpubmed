BACKGROUND
as demonstrated by the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts, endosymbiosis is a major driving force behind eukaryotic cell evolution leading to acquisition of new intracellular components and cell diversity  <cit> . although endosymbiosis is an important and widespread phenomenon, the mechanisms controlling the establishment of endosymbiosis between different eukaryotic cells are not well understood. in fact, p. bursaria cells harbor about  <dig> symbiotic algae in their cytoplasm  <cit> . each alga is enclosed in a perialgal vacuole  membrane derived from the host digestive vacuole  membrane, which protects the alga from the host’s lysosomal fusion . irrespective of the mutual relations between p. bursaria and symbiotic algae , the symbiont-free cells and the symbiotic algae retain the ability to grow without a partner. symbiont-free cells can be prepared by various means: cultivation under constant dark conditions , treatment with cycloheximide  <cit> , and treatment with the photosynthesis inhibitor dichlorophenyl dimethylurea   <cit> . however, symbiotic algae can be isolated by homogenization or by sonication or by the treatment of symbiotic cells with detergent. they can grow outside host cells  <cit> . symbiont-free cells are easily reinfected with symbiotic algae by mixing the two together. therefore, p. bursaria has been considered an excellent model for studying cell–cell interaction and the evolution of eukaryotic cells through secondary endosymbiosis between different protists  <cit> . however, neither genomic nor transcriptomic information has been available to elucidate the establishment of endosymbiosis in p. bursaria to date. to expedite the process of gene discovery related to the endosymbiosis, we have undertaken illumina deep sequencing of mrnas prepared from symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free p. bursaria cells in this study. our data provide a comprehensive sequence resource for the advancement of p. bursaria study.

RESULTS
deep-sequencing and assembly
we constructed three rna-seq libraries from mrna of p. bursaria harboring symbiotic alga, chlorella variabilis, and three libraries from symbiont-free p. bursaria. sequencing using illumina hiseq <dig> platform yielded  <dig>  million 101-by-101 bp paired-end sequence reads. after trimming the low-quality parts and removing reads of less than 50 bp,  <dig>  million reads  remained. to obtain a comprehensive sequence set of the p. bursaria transcriptome, all the clean reads of symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free libraries were assembled together using the trinity program  <cit> . the de novo assembly produced  <dig>  contigs, clustering into  <dig>  subcomponents . we selected the longest transcript as the representative for each cluster. the unigene sizes were 200 bp up to  <dig>  bp, with mean length of 904 bp, n <dig> of  <dig>  bp totaling  <dig> ,860 bp for all unigenes;  <dig>   of unigenes were longer than  <dig>  bp.

we excluded unigenes derived from the symbiotic chlorella and other contaminants. of the  <dig>  contig sequences,  <dig>  were matched to the c. variabilis sequences, and were therefore removed. unigenes lowly expressed with log-counts-per-million  <  <dig> were also discarded because they are likely to be contaminant sequences or poor assembly models. based on the database search, the small amount of the contaminant sequences appears to be derived from some bacteria such as methylobacterium and burkholderiales, which are likely to be included in the culture media in which we grew p. bursaria. these procedures produced p. bursaria transcript reference sequences composed of  <dig>  unigenes.

annotation of the assembled contigs
we performed similarity searches of the  <dig>  p. bursaria unigenes against the swiss-prot and uniref <dig> protein sequence databases  <cit>  using blastx  <cit>  with the e-value cutoff of 1e- <dig> and assigned the functional annotations of the most similar protein sequences. of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   had matches with  <dig>  unique records in the swiss-prot database;  <dig>   had matches with  <dig>  unique records in the uniref <dig> database. the species distribution of the blastx best hits in the uniref <dig> database showed that  <dig>   of the  <dig>  hits had top matches with sequences from p. tetraurelia, followed by tetrahymena thermophila with  <dig>  best blastx hits.

we predicted open reading frames  from the  <dig>  p. bursaria unigene sequences using orfpredictor  <cit> . of the  <dig>  orfs,  <dig>  were longer than  <dig> amino acids,  <dig>  were longer than  <dig> amino acids, and  <dig>  were longer than  <dig> amino acids. although whole genome sequences have been clarified in p. tetraurelia <cit>  and t. thermophila <cit> , endosymbiotic algae including chlorella species have not yet been detected in these ciliates. therefore, we tried to compare their orfs length, gc%, and shared gene clusters among these two ciliates and p. bursaria to elucidate the genomic features of p. bursaria as a potential host cell for the symbiotic algae.

we compared orfs  of p. bursaria with those of its close relatives p. tetraurelia and t. thermophila. the maximum values for lengths of orfs for p. bursaria, p. tetraurelia, and t. thermophila were, respectively,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the median values for lengths of orfs for p. bursaria, p. tetraurelia, and t. thermophila were, respectively,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . the corresponding values for g + c contents  of orfs were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  .

we identified  <dig>  orthologous gene clusters containing  <dig>  orfs from the three organisms: i.e.  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  orfs longer than  <dig> amino acids long, respectively, from p. bursaria, p. tetraurelia, and t. thermophila. figure  <dig> shows the number of orthologous gene clusters shared among the three organisms. of the  <dig>  orthologous gene clusters,  <dig>  were common to all three organisms,  <dig>  were unique to paramecium species, and  <dig>  were unique to p. bursaria.figure  <dig>

differential gene expression between symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free conditions
we compared gene expressions of symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free p. bursaria to elucidate the genetic control for establishment of secondary symbiosis. of the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>  were significantly differentially expressed between symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free cells with false discovery rates  <  <dig>  .

the positive and negative values of log <dig> fold change  show that the sequences were up-regulated and down-regulated in symbiont-bearing cells compared to symbiont-free cells. the parametric analysis of gene set enrichment   <cit>  detected enrichment in the  <dig> gene ontology  terms, i.e.  <dig> biological processes,  <dig> cellular components, and  <dig> molecular functions based on the logfc between symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free cells with false discovery rates  <  <dig>  . figure  <dig> portrays a parent–child relation between go molecular function terms including the six highest ranking go terms based on page p-values: oxidoreductase activity , structural constituent of ribosome , pyridoxal phosphate binding , phosphorelay response regulator activity , chromatin binding , and phosphorelay sensor kinase activity . a closer examination of individual proteins assigned to these go terms revealed that trans-2-enoyl-coa , aminotransferases  and ribosomal proteins tended to be down-regulated, whereas transcriptional activator myb-related proteins , and signal transduction histidine kinase  tended to be up-regulated in symbiont-bearing cells relative to symbiont-free cells.table  <dig>

based on the knowledge of p. bursaria accumulated to date, functions can be inferred for some of the six highest ranking go terms. down-regulation of ribosomal proteins in symbiont-bearing p. bursaria cells suggests that algal proteins with functions equivalent to those of the host paramecium cells are transferred to the host through the pv membrane. consequently transcriptional activity of the host was reduced. however, no report to date has described a demonstration showing that the proteins synthesized by the algae and transferred to the host cell through photosynthetic products, mainly maltose, are transferred from the algae  <cit> .

up-regulation of signal transduction histidine kinase in symbiont-bearing p. bursaria cells suggests that the histidine kinases play an important role in signal perception in this secondary symbiosis, as shown in the primary symbiosis by bacteria  <cit>  for the adaptation and survival of various organisms to harsh environmental conditions  <cit> . sensor histidine kinases are known to play important roles in several eukaryotic species including yeasts, fungi, slime molds, and higher plants . symbiont-bearing p. bursaria cells acquire various stress resistance through endosymbiosis with chlorella spp .

in addition to the genes of enriched go terms discussed above, heat shock 70 kda protein  and glutathione s-transferase  genes were up-regulated and down-regulated as shown by the positive and negative values of logfc, respectively, in symbiont-bearing cells compared to symbiont-free cells . of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig> were annotated as hsp <dig> with logfc of - <dig>  to  <dig> , with a median of  <dig> . symbiont-bearing p. bursaria cells are known to show a higher survival ratio against nickel chloride, high temperature, and hydrogen peroxide than the symbiont-free cells show  <cit> . furthermore, p. caudatum cells reportedly acquire heat-shock resistance by infection of endonucler symbiotic bacteria holospora, and osmotic-shock resistance  <cit> . hori and fujishima  <cit>  reported that h. obtusa-bearing paramecia expressed high levels of hsp <dig> mrna even at 25°c. the up-regulation of the transcripts encoding hsp <dig> might be related to the host’s tolerance to environmental fluctuations. of the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig> were annotated as gst and tended to be down-regulated with logfc of - <dig>  to - <dig> , with a median of - <dig>  . this enzyme is related to protection of cells from oxidative stress, as shown by mccord and fridovich  <cit>  and by veal et al.  <cit> . although it was conceivable that photo-oxidative stress in symbiont-bearing p. bursaria cells is greater than that in symbiont-free ones, our data showed opposite results from the prediction. a similar result was obtained by hörtnagl and sommaruga  <cit> . they suggested that the presence of algal symbionts minimizes photo-oxidative stress  <cit> . consequently, different expression levels in these genes between symbiont-free and symbiont-bearing p. bursaria agree well with differences in cytological phenomena observed in these paramecia, suggesting that these proteins appear to be involved in the symbiosis. immunological detections of the gene products and comparisons of the amount of the antigens or qualitative pcr between the symbiont-free and the symbiont-bearing paramecia are necessary for future experiments. to ascertain the molecular mechanisms controlling the secondary symbiosis between paramecium and chlorella cells, transcriptome analyses and proteome analyses of the symbiotic chlorella alone cultivated in algal culture medium and the same chlorella inside the host paramecium are necessary for future studies.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first whole transcriptome analysis conducted between symbiont-free and symbiont-bearing p. bursaria. results showed p. bursaria genes that differentially expressed in symbiont-bearing and symbiont-free conditions. we showed that genes for glutathione s-transferase, trans-2-enoyl-coa, aminotransferases, and ribosomal proteins are down-regulated, and that genes for hsp <dig>  transcriptional activator myb-related proteins, and signal transduction histidine kinase are up-regulated in the symbiont-bearing p. bursaria. our results enable us to understand the molecular mechanism for establishment of the secondary symbiosis and for the host evolutionary adaptation to global climate change.
