BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus  is the leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections, both community- and hospital-acquired  <cit> . s. aureus is a versatile pathogen that has the intriguing capacity to modulate both the host’s coagulation and fibrinolytic system.

we and others have shown that fibrin formation induced by the bacterial prothrombin activators staphylocoagulase and von willebrand factor-binding protein is an important virulence factor for both localized and systemic infections by s. aureus and is essential for abscess formation  <cit> . most s. aureus strains causing infection in humans also produce staphylokinase . sak forms an equimolar complex with human plasmin  catalyzing the further activation of plasminogen. the sak-hupli complex is sensitive to rapid inhibition by alpha-2-antiplasmin  unless it is bound to fibrin via the lysine binding sites of plasmin. this mechanism accounts for the fibrin-specificity of sak  <cit> . although sak has received considerable research attention during its development as a fibrinolytic agent in cardiovascular medicine  <cit> , few studies have investigated its relevance in s. aureus infection  <cit> .

streptokinase, secreted by group a, c and g streptococci, is the other well-known bacterial plasminogen activator. like sak, streptokinase is specific for human plasminogen  but its action is not inhibited by α2ap  <cit> . streptokinase is a key virulence factor and the primary determinant of the species-selectivity of group a streptococcal infections. mortality after infection with group a streptococci is markedly increased in huplg transgenic mice  <cit> . interestingly, a subcluster of streptokinase  has been identified that is sensitive to α2ap inhibition, leading to site-restricted plasminogen activation in these, mostly skin-trophic, group a streptococci  <cit> .

the role of sak as a potential virulence factor in s. aureus disease remains unresolved. sak is present in the large majority of s. aureus strains causing human infection  <cit> . in contrast, s. aureus strains from veterinary sources commonly lack sak production  <cit> . sak, like streptokinase  <cit> , thus constitutes an adaptation of s. aureus for human infection. the sak gene has a highly conserved sequence  <cit>  and is carried on a bacteriophage containing other genes with an important function in immune evasion, such as complement inhibitory factors and enterotoxins  <cit> . sak was shown to enhance the breaching of tissue barriers in vitro  <cit> .

the present study aimed at evaluating if plasmin generation by sak impacts on proteolytic activity in s. aureus infected skin and on the local and systemic dissemination of s. aureus. we further investigated if the host α2ap, by inhibiting the sak-plasmin activity, reduces the virulence of s. aureus.

RESULTS
bacterial staphylokinase production
supernatant of overnight cultures of the bioluminescent s. aureus xen <dig> contained similar levels of sak compared to lab strains and to clinical s. aureus strains from skin infection and from bacteremia with cutaneous origin. sak expression by ls- <dig> spasak, which expresses sak under the control of the protein a promoter, was about tenfold higher . thus, s. aureus xen <dig> is a relevant micro-organism to study the role of sak in a skin infection model.figure  <dig>

adenoviral-mediated human plasminogen expression
to overcome the species-selectivity of sak for huplg, huplg was expressed in mice through adenoviral gene transfer. seven to  <dig> days after adenoviral injection, i.e. at the start of the subcutaneous infection experiment, huplg plasma values in adplasm injected mice were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml in α2ap ko and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml in α2ap wt mice. in mice injected with the control adnull adenoviral vector, values of huplg were below the detection level . human plasminogen remained present until the end of the experiment  . hence, the expression of huplg allowed for the selective interaction of sak with huplg throughout the course of the subcutaneous infection experiment.figure  <dig>

compared to wild type mice, bacterial spreading in α2ap ko mice was similar in the early stages of the infection, but was more pronounced at day  <dig>  , resulting in an increase in macroscopic lesion size at day  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm <dig> in wt/null mice , p =  <dig> ) . bacterial density was higher in α2ap ko mice compared to wild type mice  . in an additional experiment, α2ap ko or wt mice were infected with s. aureus ls- <dig> ep. we observed similar initial fibrin deposition in the abscess periphery in both groups at day  <dig> , consistent with a normal capacity for fibrin formation in α2ap ko plasma ex vivo . however, at a later time point, less fibrin was observed in α2ap ko mice, as shown in additional file  <dig> 

the largest lesion size was observed in the α2ap ko mice with human plasminogen expression  vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm <dig> in wt/null , p <  <dig> ) . the spreading of the bacteria was more pronounced from early in the course of infection  . also the intensity of the bioluminescence, which relates to the bacterial density, was the highest in the α2ap ko/huplg group  .

the assessment of systemic spread of s. aureus, by quantifying bacterial load in spleen and kidney, did not differ significantly between the  <dig> groups. at day  <dig>  there were  <dig> mice in the α2ap ko/huplg group with distant infection in spleen and/or kidney,  <dig> mice in the α2ap ko/null group,  <dig> mouse in the wt/huplg group and none in the wt/null group.

in the first series of experiments, we observed that the differentiation between the groups both in macroscopic phenotype  and in bioluminescence lesion size and intensity became apparent early in the course of infection. therefore, to assess macroscopic and microscopic phenotype and proteolytic activity, mice were sacrificed at day  <dig> in a subsequent set of experiments.

macroscopical assessment confirmed closed abscesses in wt/null mice, compared to more diffusely spread lesions with skin rupture in huplg expressing mice  .figure  <dig>

histopathologic analysis of lesional skin sections from α2ap ko/huplg mice showed, apart from breaching of skin, penetration of infection starting from the initial infection site, past a peripheral fibrin zone, into subdermal tissue layers .

mechanism of sak action in s. aureus skin infections
sak is species-selective and fibrin-specific
the observations in the subcutaneous infection model can be explained by the sak-mediated plasmin generation. to this end however, the values of huplg achieved after adenoviral huplg expression in mice, should be able to rescue the species-selectivity of sak in a murine model. sak induced rapid plasmin generation if added to huplg but not with murine plasminogen  . however, activation of muplg was observed in the presence of sak and trace amounts of human plasminogen . also, addition of a preformed sak-hupli complex triggered secondary activation of muplg, as illustrated in figure 5b. for all further experiments, a mixture of muplg  and huplg  was used to reflect the in vivo conditions of partial huplg expression against a background of muplg.figure  <dig>

sak-mediated plasmin generation was further enhanced in the presence of fibrin, as cnbr-digested fibrinogen fragments )  or as solid fibrin . for convenience, fg was used in further experiments, as an accepted soluble alternative to solid fibrin. this increase in plasmin generation in the presence of fibrin can be explained by a reduced inactivation of fibrin-associated sak-hupli complex by α2ap. as shown in figure 5c, α2ap inhibited sak-induced plasmin generation in control conditions, but had little effect on sak-induced plasmin generation in the presence of fg . higher concentrations of fg completely protected sak-induced plasmin from inhibition by α2ap  .

bacterial cell surface protects sak from α2ap inhibition
we also studied if, besides fibrin, bacterial surfaces could protect the sak-hupli complex from α2ap inhibition. indeed, the presence of bacteria increased plasmin generation following addition of sak . addition of murine α2ap significantly reduced plasmin generation by ≈ 70% to a <dig>  90min of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , whereas in the presence of bacteria, α2ap only led to a ≈ 50% reduction in plasmin generation  . we used a sak-negative s. aureus strain  for this subset of experiments to eliminate confounding by sak production during the course of the experiment. however, similar results were observed for sak-positive s. aureus xen <dig>  which was the strain used in animal experiments. comparable results were also obtained when heat-killed instead of viable s. aureus was used .figure  <dig>

sak-hupli complex activates gelatinases
plasmin has a broad proteolytic spectrum that includes extracellular matrix proteins. however, plasmin is also known to activate gelatinases, which can cause secondary proteolytic activity. in order to assess whether gelatinase activation contributes to the observed bacterial spreading, we measured the activation of gelatinases by sak-hupli in murine skin extracts.

addition of sak and huplg to extracts of murine skin led to activation of pro-mmp- <dig> . in line with the low expression of mmp- <dig> in normal non-inflamed skin, pro-mmp- <dig> and active mmp- <dig> could not be clearly identified on these zymograms of murine skin. however, we did observe mmp- <dig> activation in ht <dig> cell culture supernatant after incubation with sak and huplg .figure  <dig>

discussion
we evaluated the role of sak-mediated plasminogen activation in a subcutaneous s. aureus skin infection model in mice. our results demonstrate that plasmin generation by sak increased spreading and hampered bacterial clearance of s. aureus in infected skin, increased tissue proteolytic mmp activity, and resulted in more pronounced tissue damage, as noted by more open skin lesions. these findings were enhanced in the absence of the plasmin inhibitor α2ap, demonstrating a role for host α2ap in the containment of s. aureus infections.

strengths of our model are the use of a s. aureus strain derived from a human infection in healthy mice, and the non-invasive follow-up of bacterial spreading by bioluminescence. the use of an adenoviral vector encoding huplg resulted in plasma huplg levels similar to those attained in transgenic huplg mice  <cit> . our in vitro data confirm that these huplg concentrations in mice are sufficient to overcome the species-selectivity of sak and to mimic the phenotype of sak-mediated huplg activation in the subcutaneous infection model.

our results are in line with previous results showing that spreading through tissue barriers can be mediated by sak activity  <cit> . plasmin activity generated by sak can degrade several extracellular matrix components, but not collagens  <cit> . yet, we show that sak-mediated plasmin activity can lead to secondary activation of gelatinases in mouse skin extracts, which may contribute to the proteolytic activity necessary for dissemination through tissue.

although we observed more proteolytic activity and increased lesion dimensions in α2ap ko/huplg groups, we did not observe systemic spread nor mortality after subcutaneous inoculation of s. aureus. however, systemic dissemination was common when using a neutropenic mouse model of s. aureus skin infection, as recently shown  <cit> . this is in agreement with the clinical observation that skin infections by s. aureus infrequently lead to systemic dissemination, unless there is an underlying vulnerability of the patient. in immunocompetent mice , staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections are mainly characterized by abscess formation, and bacteria that do reach the systemic circulation or distant organs are rapidly cleared.

the predominantly local effect of sak-mediated plasmin activity without affecting the severity of systemic symptoms is also in contrast with the findings by sun et al.  <cit> , demonstrating that streptokinase increased mortality of group a streptococcal infection in a skin infection model in huplg transgene mice. importantly, streptokinase is insensitive to α2ap inhibition, in contrast with the sak-hupli complex that is rapidly inactivated by α2ap. our results confirm previous findings that fibrin protects the sak-hupli complex from inactivation; and a similar protective effect was noted from bacterial surfaces  <cit> . this may explain why sak-mediated plasmin has more localized effects compared to streptokinase-induced plasmin. sak-induced proteolysis is thus confined to the immediate surroundings of the site of infection, where high concentrations of fibrin and bacteria prevent inactivation, but is rapidly neutralized further away from the abscess site. in contrast, streptokinase-activated plasmin may have a larger potential for systemic effect because of its resistance to α2ap.

to explore whether inhibition by α2ap accounts for the more localized effect of sak compared to streptokinase, we studied the impact of the genetic absence of α2ap on the characteristics of s. aureus skin infection. indeed, α2ap ko was associated with larger lesion sizes, compatible with a protective role of α2ap in tempering the proteolytic effect of sak-mediated plasmin. the larger lesion size in α2ap ko/null mice, lacking huplg expression, is likely explained by activation of murine plasminogen, bound to surface plasminogen receptors of s. aureus, by host plasminogen activators. different surface plasminogen receptors have been described in s. aureus, such as α-enolase, inosine 5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase, ribonucleotide reductase subunit  <dig>  triose phosphate isomerase, surface immunoglobulin-binding protein and extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein  <cit> . these surface plasminogen receptors are not selective for huplg and constitute a common theme across different bacterial and fungal organisms for the degradation of extracellular matrix and immune evasion  <cit> . the resulting surface-bound plasmin activity is less sensitive to inhibition by plasma protease inhibitors, hence a slower but consistently larger expansion of the lesion occurs in the α2ap ko/null group compared to wt/null controls. the role of host α2ap in limiting bacterial spreading was confirmed in additional experiments where a sak-negative strain  was used to infect α2ap ko and α2ap wt mice. as α2ap gene deficiency does not impair fibrin generation, the initial fibrin deposition surrounding the abscess was comparable in both groups. however, at a later time point the absence of the main plasmin inhibitor led to increased dissolution of the peripheral fibrin sheath. although there was a trend towards higher numbers of systemic infection in α2ap ko mice , we could not demonstrate a strong effect of α2ap ko on systemic spreading. although α2ap is the predominant plasmin inhibitor, other plasma inhibitors of fibrinolysis such as alpha-2-macroglobulin may explain the absence of systemic spread in α2ap ko/huplg mice  <cit> .

interestingly, we also observed increased bacterial loads in the presence of huplg and/or in the absence of α2ap, demonstrating that bacterial induced plasmin generation helps to evade bacterial clearance by the host. it has been shown previously that sak binds to and inactivates human defensins, part of the innate immune defense against bacteria  <cit> . sak-induced plasmin activity can degrade opsonizing complement components igg and c3b  <cit> , thus protecting s. aureus from phagocytosis.

the production of sak, a highly fibrin-specific plasminogen activator  <cit> , is particularly intriguing as s. aureus also triggers fibrin formation through coagulase activity. the role of staphylocoagulase-mediated fibrin deposition in abscess formation is well established  <cit> . s. aureus also possesses different binding proteins which interact with fibrin and extracellular matrix proteins  <cit> . it remains to be resolved how coagulase-mediated fibrin deposition and sak-mediated fibrinolysis cooperate to promote s. aureus virulence. coagulase activity and the resulting fibrin have been shown to shield s. aureus from leukocytes, promoting early replication and persistence. in this view, sak allows s. aureus to generate fibrinolytic activity that is protected by both the staphylothrombin- and thrombin-generated fibrin from rapid neutralization by host protease inhibitors. the resulting plasmin activity can degrade the host’s fibrin as well as the s. aureus-mediated fibrin and allow subsequent spreading of the growing bacterial colony. how s. aureus differentially regulates coagulase and sak activity remains unknown. interestingly, sak expression is under control of the agr quorum sensing system, suggesting that proteolytic activity is modulated by bacterial density  <cit> . a regulated expression of sak may also explain the observed decreased virulence of genetically engineered s. aureus strains with sak overproduction, not under control of its own promotor, as continuous and high-level sak production will interfere with coagulase activity as a central virulence factor of s. aureus  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we show that sak-mediated proteolytic activity in s. aureus infected skin facilitates local spreading, increases tissue damage of skin and reduces bacterial clearance by the host. the underlying mechanisms involve protection of the sak-hupli complex associated with fibrin or bacterial surfaces, from rapid inhibition by α2ap. in turn, active sak-hupli may activate gelatinases, further promoting degradation of the extracellular matrix. overall, this study shows the role of subversion of the host fibrinolytic system by sak-producing s. aureus in migration through tissue barriers.
