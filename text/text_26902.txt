BACKGROUND
m. bovis is a major, but often overlooked, pathogen causing respiratory disease, mastitis, and arthritis in cattle. first isolated from the milk of mastitic cow in  <dig> in us, this bacteria appears to have spread across ireland, south america, and europe  <cit> . in china, the first m. bovis pneumonia case was reported in hubei province in  <dig>  and the pathogen genome was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> . until now, m. bovis pneumonia cases, mostly in cattle, have been reported in more than ten chinese provinces. and it often outbreaks in calves after transport. the mabs used for m. bovis detection were reported previously, and most of them were selected against whole m. bovis cells  <cit>  or m. bovis variable surface lipoproteins  that undergo high-frequency phase and size variations  <cit> .

p <dig> protein is an immunodominant invariable lipoprotein exposed on the membrane of m. agalactiae <cit> . the m. bovis p <dig> protein is homologous to that of m. agalactiae, which was first studied in  <dig>  a single protein band was observed in rabbit antiserum raised against p <dig> protein of m. agalactiae in a m. bovis reference strain pg <dig> and  <dig> field isolates. an antibody response against m. bovis recombinant p <dig> protein has been detected both in experimentally and naturally infected animals, suggesting a stable expression of the corresponding genes. over all, p <dig> protein is a useful marker for m. bovis infection and an alternative candidate for the development of specific serological test for m. bovis <cit> .

here, we developed a direct competitive elisa  to detect m. bovis specific antibody in serum based on a p <dig> protein mab 10e. this dc-elisa showed a higher positive rate than two commercial i-elisa kits in detection of  <dig> chinese clinical bovine serum samples.

RESULTS
expression of p <dig> protein in e. coli
to clone p <dig> gene without leader peptide of m. bovis strain hubei- <dig>  a pair of primers  was used. the amplified  <dig>  bp product was cloned and sequenced, and data showed that five uga codons were present  in the target gene. therefore, five pairs of mutagenic primers were designed to mutate uga into ugg using overlap extension pcr with some modifications. in the first and second pcr runs, the bases on  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  were mutated from “a” to “g”, with the 5′ and 3′-terminus joined fragments bearing restriction sites for nco i and xho i to facilitate cloning. after the third and fourth runs, the base on  <dig> was mutated from “a” to “g” . the mutated p48-lacking peptide gene was then cloned into plasmid pet <dig>  and transferred into transetta . approximately a 50 kda protein band was was analyzed by sds-page .

selection and characterization of mab against p <dig> protein
to select mabs with the desired affinity, hybridomas were screened by i-elisa, and positive cells were selected and subcloned at least three times using a limiting dilution method. mabs isotypes, detected using the commercial elisa kit protocol, were all lgg <dig> . one monoclone  designated 10e, which could produce an antibody that specifically recognized p <dig> protein, was selected to produce and purify mab from mouse ascetic fluid of mice for further characterization.

mab 10e was used to investigate the reactivity with different pathogens by western blot. as shown in figure  <dig>  mab 10e reacted with molecular weight of 50 kda in all eight m. bovis strains, but did not react with the other related pathogens including m. agalactiae. homology analysis using the ncbi blast server indicated that p <dig> protein amino acid sequences of m. bovis strain hubei- <dig> and m. agalactiae were similar . also mab 10e was not cross-reactive with m. agalactiae, likely due to the differences in amino acid sequences or in antibody-binding sites between p <dig> proteins of m. agalactiae and m. bovis. this suggests that mab 10e was specific, not only to p <dig> protein, but also to m. bovis.

determination of cut-off value and specificity of dc-elisa
after protocol optimization,  <dig> negative bovine sera and  <dig> positive bovine sera were used to determine the cut-off value. because the pi p-value of negative sera as analyzed by the shapiro-wilk test was  <dig> , we concluded that the data were normally distributed with a mean percent inhibition of  <dig> % . hence, the cut-off value was set as 32%  to determine the status of serum samples in response to m. bovis antibodies . all the positive sera had pi values exceeding 32%, suggesting that the cut-off value of 32% was appropriate for distinguishing between negative and positive serum obviously.

to confirm dc-elisa specificity, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus , bovine viral diarrhea virus , bovine parainfluenza virus type  <dig> , and bovine respiratory syncytial virus  positive control serum, rabbit hyperimmune antiserum against mycoplasma bovirhinis , mycoplasma arginine , and m. agalactiae were used in this study. as shown in figure 4b, a pi level lower than 32% was considered as negative, suggesting that the dc-elisa was specific for detecting antibody against m. bovis.

comparison among dc-elisa, two commercial i-elisa kits, and dot blot
a total of  <dig> clinical bovine sera originated from various farms in different provinces were tested by dc-elisa. data were compared with that obtained from two commercial i-elisa kits and a dot blot assay. data appear in table  <dig>   <dig> sera were tested negative and  <dig> sera tested positive by all four methods. in the other  <dig> sera, except one negative in dc-elisa but positive in dot blot,  <dig> sera were confirmed to be positive by dc-elisa, and some of them  were missed by three methods. there were good agreements between dc-elisa and biovet , bio-x , dot blot .

-: negative result; +: positive result.

the positive rate of clinical serum samples from five provinces was listed in table  <dig>  generally, there was quite a high serological positive rate in all the five provinces by four methods. especially in shandong province, the positive rate was  <dig> % by dc-elisa. all those results showed that there was a relatively wide serological population of m. bovis in china.

discussion
a simple, rapid, specific and sensitive diagnostic technique is preferred for intensive surveillance of animal infectious diseases such as m. bovis. fortunately m. bovis grows well in a variety of media and produces “centered” colonies within 3-5 days, enabling the culture of these pathogens for study and assay development  <cit> . ball reported that a sandwich elisa using monoclonal antibodies for m. bovis antigen has similar sensitivity to that of conventional culture diagnosis  <cit> , and he also reported real-time pcr was better for detecting m. bovis than sandwich elisa, which suggested that real-time pcr could replace the sandwich elisa for m. bovis detection  <cit> . conventional pcr assays are developed based the 16s rrna gene  <cit> , but some researchers suggested that the pcr-based uvrc gene is more specific  <cit> . in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry  <cit>  also have been used to identify m. bovis.

many serological tests including indirect hemagglutination and film inhibition have been reported, but these methods were inferior to i-elisa using whole cell or chemically treated antigens  <cit> . and, i-elisas based on recombinant vspa, membrane lipoprotein p <dig> protein  <cit>  or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase   <cit>  have been developed. in a competitive/blocking elisa, immunoglobulins from positive serum samples compete to inhibit the mab from binding to its specific binding site on antigens and subsequently prevent color development. in contrast, non-reactive sera produce a strong colored reaction  <cit> . competitive/blocking elisas have been confirmed to be significantly sensitivity and specific for detecting antibody to bluetongsue virus <cit> , west nile virus <cit> , and francisella tularensis <cit> , and even a higher sensitivity than i-elisa for detection to mycoplasma meleagridis <cit>  and prrsv  <cit> . a blocking elisa with a mab to a certain antigen and the whole-cell lysate of m. bovis as the target antigen is a high specific with a good sensitivity, low background, and no cross-reactivity  <cit> .

here, we report the development of a dc-elisa with a mab 10e against p <dig> protein and p <dig> protein as the coated-antigen. mab 10e was quite specific for all eight m. bovis strains and did not cross-react with other related pathogens as evidenced by western blot . thus, we concluded that a dc-elisa with micro plates coated with purified recombinant p <dig> protein was more specific than those coated with whole-cell lysates of m. bovis. antisera of other pathogens had pi values less than 32%, indicating that our dc-elisa was more specific for the detection of antibodies against m. bovis . furthermore, the mab 10e was conjugated with hrp, which replaced the use of hrp-conjugated goat-anti-bovine igg and the procedure steps were simplified.

a total of  <dig> clinical bovine serum samples  were assayed, and dc-elisa  detected more samples than a biovet commercial i-elisa kit  or a bio-x kit . data from the dc-elisa suggested a relatively wide serological population of m. bovis in the studied provinces , especially in shandong province . simultaneously, pcr detections of m. bovis has been done with the nasal swab samples from shandong province using mb-f/r primers. in these  <dig> samples from shandong,  <dig> samples were serologically positive by dc-elisa whereas  <dig> samples were etiologically positive, including all the  <dig> serologically positive ones . these results showed that pcr was more sensitive than dc-elisa, a finding that agreed with ali ghadersohi’s report  <cit> . generally, during early stages of microbiological infection, less antibodies are produced, so pcr pathogen detection is better than serological detection for the evaluation of infection. in contrast dc-elisa is reliable when antibiotics have been used to treat an infection and dc-elisa is simpler and more suitable for high-throughput detection. the dc-elisa method we we developed holds promise for facilitating surveillance of m. bovis, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of m. bovis.

CONCLUSIONS
a dc-elisa based on mab 10e, which was prepared against p <dig> protein and capable of identifying all m. bovis strains with no cross-reactivity to related pathogens, was developed to detect m. bovis infection. with a pi cut-off value of 32%, the dc-elisa had higher positive detection rates than two commercial i-elisa kits when they were used to detect  <dig> clinical bovine serum samples, which suggested that dc-elisa represented an improved and simplified method for surveillance of m. bovis.
