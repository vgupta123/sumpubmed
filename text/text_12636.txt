BACKGROUND
biogenic amines  are natural toxins that can occur in fermented foods and beverages and may cause adverse health effects  <cit> . ba production in foodstuffs is mainly due to microbial metabolism of amino acids, with lactic acid bacteria  being the primary agents  <cit> . tyramine and putrescine are the ba most frequently encountered  <cit> .

lactobacillus and enterococcus spp. are often implicated in tyramine formation resulting from tyrosine decarboxylation  <cit> . tyramine production has been observed in cheeses, fermented sausages and beverages  and factors that influence tyramine biosynthesis have been reported  <cit> . a relationship between tyramine content of foods, and illnesses after ingestion, has been established . these illnesses include headache, migraine, neurological disorders, nausea, vomiting, respiratory disorders and hypertension. moreover, the adherence of some enteropathogens, such as escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  to intestinal mucosa is increased in the presence of tyramine  <cit> . bacteria can produce putrescine from ornithine, using ornithine decarboxylase  <cit> , or, alternatively from agmatine, using agmatine deiminase  <cit> . putrescine synthesis was initially observed mainly in enterobacteriacea, though recently it has been shown that lab present in food and beverages can produce this ba . amines, such as putrescine, can react with nitrite to form nitrosamines, which can have carcinogenic properties and are therefore a potential health hazard to humans  <cit> .

one open question is whether ba-producers present in fermented foods and beverages are able to survive in the human git and still produce ba. during digestion, the ph of the human gastric environment can decrease to values below ph  <dig>  some lab possess high resistance to gastrointestinal stress and frequently have adhesive properties that allow them to colonize the intestinal tract  <cit> . we have recently shown that the dairy tyramine-producer enterococcus durans  <dig> was significantly resistant to in vitro conditions which mimicked the human git and, it was able to synthesize ba under git stress conditions  <cit> . possession of a functional tyramine biosynthetic pathway enhanced the binding of e. durans to caco- <dig> human intestinal cells  <cit> .

to further investigate this issue, we report here experiments with the wine strain lactobacillus brevis ioeb  <dig>  <cit> , which possesses both the tyrosine decarboxylation and the agmatine deimination pathways  <cit> . four genes  involved in tyrosine production have been identified in l. brevis ioeb 9809: a putative tyrosyl trna synthetase, a tyrosine decarboxylase, a tyrosine-tyramine exchanger and a na+/h+ antiporter. the gene cluster for agmatine catabolism lies immediately downstream of the tdc operon, and its genes encode a putrescine transcarbamylase, an agmatine/putrescine exchanger, two putative agmatine deiminases , a carbamate kinase and a putative transcriptional regulator . the presence of a functional substrate/product transmembrane exchanger in both systems suggests that the pathways may be involved in ph homeostasis.

in this study we have subjected l. brevis ioeb  <dig> to an in vitro system, which partially mimics physical stresses in the human gastrointestinal tract, to determine if ba synthesis occurs. transcriptional analysis was used to detect any enhancement of tyrosine decarboxylase  and agmatine deiminase  gene expression. furthermore, the adhesion of the ioeb  <dig> strain to human epithelial intestinal cells was investigated and ba production in bacteria-human cells co-cultures was measured.

RESULTS
behaviour of l. brevis ioeb  <dig> under simulated upper digestive tract conditions
to test for ba production and the influence of active ba biosynthetic pathways on bacterial survival ioeb  <dig> was grown to approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> in mrs medium in the absence or presence of  <dig> mm tyrosine or  <dig>  mm agmatine sulphate or both . then, the cultures were subjected to conditions that simulated some of the more important conditions of the human upper digestive tract, including treatment with lysozyme at ph  <dig>   and at a range of low ph in the presence of pepsin . acidity within the human stomach during digestion is in the range ph  <dig> - <dig>  which corresponds to the range of maximum activity of pepsin  <cit> . however, during food ingestion, and depending on the food matrix, bacteria can be exposed to a broader ph gradient. therefore, during gastric treatment the bacteria were exposed to a decreasing range of ph from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which we have previously used for testing of probiotic and lactic acid bacteria  <cit> .

ba production was quantified by reverse-phase hplc of culture supernatants, and cell viability was assessed by plate counting. under all conditions, production of tyramine and putrescine was observed in the presence of the corresponding precursor . the bacterium was sensitive to all conditions tested . the saliva simulation reduced the survival of ioeb  <dig> to 34% in the control samples. a higher survival  was observed in the presence of tyrosine, which was enhanced  when agmatine was included in the assay. this survival-aiding influence of tyrosine was not previously observed with the dairy tyramine-producer e. durans  <dig>  <cit> , and as far as we know this is the first report indicating that functional ba biosynthetic pathways or presence of their precursors contribute to diminish damage of cell wall by lysozyme. the mechanism for this is unclear.

tyramine  and putrescine  production were detected by rp-hplc during the saliva and gastric stress simulation in presence of  <dig> mm tyrosine,  <dig>  mm agmatine or both. results are expressed in μm of ba produced by  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> in  <dig> min, they are the mean of three independent experiments and there are corrected for the cfu added to the experiment. putrescine and tyramine were below the detection limits  in the uninoculated mrs and in absence of the corresponding ba precursor. differences were assessed by anova test. different superscript letters associated with values of the same ba indicate statistically significant differences .

the pattern of increased survival was also detected under gastric simulation at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . below ph  <dig>  reduction of viability was marked. this reduction was qualitatively confirmed by confocal microscopy, after bacterial staining with syto <dig> and propidium iodide. an example is depicted in figure  <dig>  in cultures subjected to gastric stress at ph  <dig>  a mixed population of green  and red  were detected. moreover, the proportion of green cells was low in the absence of precursors  and progressively increased in the presence of agmatine , tyrosine  and both ba precursors . in addition, in untreated cultures only green cells were detected whereas only a few cells, most of them red  were observed after exposure to gastric conditions at very acidic ph  <dig>  . the tyrosine decarboxylase of ioeb  <dig> has an optimal ph of  <dig>  and is active between ph  <dig> - <dig>  in cell suspension  <cit> . in agreement we found the highest levels of tyramine production under gastric stress in the range ph  <dig> - <dig>  . interestingly, significant concentrations of tyramine  and putrescine  were observed in the samples exposed to ph  <dig>  in the presence of the two ba precursors, even though only  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> were detected at the end of the assay. this suggests that the inoculum was able to synthesise a substantial quantity of tyrosine decarboxylase during the test before cell death and lysis occurred, and that probably the tyrosine decarboxylase remained substantially active in the dead cells and cell lysate. the tyrosine decarboxylase of ioeb  <dig> is active in a range of ph  <dig> - <dig>  in cell-free extract  <cit> .

when we simulated the gastric environment, in addition to the action of lysozyme, the bacteria were subjected to multiple stress stimuli: decreasing ph, proteolytic activity of pepsin and heat shock at 37°c. griswold et al.  <cit>  , propose that the agdi operon could be part of a general stress response pathway in streptococcus mutans. the agmatine deimination, by forming ammonia and providing atp, would result in mild deacidification of the medium, metabolic energy release and degradation of toxic compounds  <cit> . here, the maximum levels of putrescine  production by l. brevis were observed between ph  <dig> - <dig>  for cultures supplemented with agmatine , which accords with that reported for lactobacillus hilgardii at ph  <dig>   <cit>  and for streptococcus mutans at ph  <dig>   <cit> .

there is evidence suggesting that ba production enables producing organisms to survive at low ph  <cit> . our results show that at ph  <dig>  the presence of agmatine, tyrosine or both precursors enhanced the cell survival two-, three- and four-fold respectively compared to controls . at ph  <dig> , the beneficial effect on viability was even more pronounced ; however, it has no beneficial effect at more acidic phs . thus, it seems that the beneficial effect of the putrescine and tyramine biosynthetic pathways is restricted only to mild acidic conditions.

transcriptional analysis of tyrdc and agua <dig> genes
the above results indicated that an increase of ba production occurred under saliva and mild gastric stresses, presumably due either to a physiological effect, or to increased gene expression. therefore, expression of the tyrdc and agua <dig> genes, encoding tyrosine decarboxylase and agmatine deiminase, the key enzymes for tyrosine and putrescine synthesis  <cit> , were analyzed in exponential phase cultures prior to, or after, exposure to saliva and gastric stresses at ph  <dig>  or  <dig> , in the presence or absence of ba precursors. transcriptional levels were calculated relative to the mrna levels of an unstressed sample for each condition tested, using the expression of the tuf gene as internal control . a similar pattern of expression for both genes was observed in unstressed and stressed samples for all conditions tested . mrnas corresponding to tyrdc  or agua <dig>  were induced only if the bacterium had been challenged with tyrosine or agmatine. under all conditions tested, higher levels of tyrdc and agua <dig> transcripts were detected when both bas precursors were present . furthermore, it should be noted that transcriptional levels of the two genes in the control cultures were not reduced under conditions of gastric stress.

these results show a transcriptional induction of tyrdc and agua <dig> mediated by the respective ba-precursors under saliva and gastric stresses similar to that previously observed for ioeb  <dig> under wine stress conditions  <cit> . the increased transcription of both genes in the presence of tyrosine plus agmatine strongly suggests a previously undetected synchronous regulation of both ba pathways, which deserves further investigation.

considering the overall results pertaining to ba production , cell survival  and transcriptional analysis , it appears that induction of ba biosynthetic pathway at the transcriptional level by the presence of the ba precursor under mild gastric conditions results in increase of the bacterial survival.

behaviour of l. brevis ioeb  <dig> in the presence of human caco- <dig> intestinal epithelial cells
our results revealed that at ph  <dig>  there is an approximately 35% survival of ioeb  <dig>  and an approximately  <dig> % survival at ph  <dig>  . it is therefore possible, assuming ingestion of a high concentration ioeb  <dig>  that viable cells could be released from the stomach at the upper end of its normal ph range. therefore, binding ability as well as production of bas during co-incubation of ioeb  <dig> with caco- <dig> cells was analyzed. caco- <dig> cells are human colonic adenocarcinoma cells that, after differentiation, have features characteristic of mature small intestine cells  <cit> . the maximum adhesion levels were obtained within the ratios of 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> caco- <dig> cells to bacteria after  <dig> h incubation, as we have also observed for other lab and bifidobacteria  <cit> . figure  <dig> depicts the results obtained with a ratio of 1: <dig>  adhesion levels ranged from  <dig> to 3% approximately, values similar to the two probiotic bacteria tested lactobacillus acidophilus la- <dig> and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb- <dig> . moreover, we did not detect any statistically significant influence of the ba precursors on the adhesion capability of l. brevis . logically, the ability to adhere to the epithelium of the small intestine could be an aid to colonisation.

in addition, the bacteria could synthesize ba in the intestinal environment, and to test this hypothesis, the production of ba by ioeb  <dig> in the presence of caco- <dig> cells was investigated. the bacterium was exposed to the cells at a ratio of 1: <dig> in dmem medium for  <dig> h, in the presence or absence of the ba precursors, and the supernatants were analyzed by hplc. both ba were detected only when the precursors were present . levels of tyramine  slightly increased in the presence of both bas precursors , and high levels of putrescine  were observed irrespectively of tyrosine availability. enterocytes can both synthesize and take up putrescine  <cit> , however, there was little production of the ba in the absence of the bacterium , although a high consumption of agmatine was detected  , in agreement with the ability of epithelial cells to take up this compound without further metabolism  <cit> . moreover, the absence of the human cells had little effect on putrescine synthesis by ioeb  <dig> , in the presence of agmatine and tyrosine. in assays supplemented only with agmatine, a significantly lower level of putrescine was detected in samples containing only bacterial cells . these results indicate that the presence of caco- <dig> cells overcomes the need of tyrosine for full induction of the putrescine biosynthetic pathway of ioeb  <dig> in dmem medium. finally, no synthesis of tyramine by caco- <dig> cells was observed in absence of bacteria and a slight but significant increase of the ba levels was observed in the presence of both precursors when either bacteria  or co-cultures  were analyzed.

tyramine  and putrescine  were detected by rp-hplc in samples containing dmem medium supplemented or not with  <dig> mm tyrosine,  <dig>  mm agmatine or both precursors, after  <dig> h incubation. cells present during the assay: bacteria + human cells: l. brevis ioeb  <dig>  and caco- <dig> cells ; bacteria: l. brevis ioeb  <dig>  and human cells: caco- <dig> cells . results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. nd: not detected. detection limits: for put >  <dig> nm and for tym >  <dig>  nm. putrescine and tyramine were below the detection limits in the dmem medium as well as in samples containing either bacteria or caco- <dig> cells in absence of the corresponding ba precursor. differences were assessed by anova test. different superscript letters associated with values of the same ba indicate statistically significant differences .

comparison of l. brevis ioeb  <dig> with enterococcus durans 655
in a previous study  <cit>  we studied the behaviour of enterococcus durans  <dig> under saliva and gastric stresses as well as in presence of caco- <dig> epithelial cells using essentially the same conditions as described in this paper. our results reveal that the wine l. brevis ioeb  <dig>  like the dairy e. durans  <dig>  <cit> , was able to produce tyramine under saliva and gastric stresses as well as in presence of caco- <dig> epithelial cells. in addition, l. brevis was able to produce putrescine in all conditions tested. however, unlike e. durans <cit>  an increase of bacterial survival under saliva and mild gastric  stresses correlated with transcriptional activation of both ba biosynthetic pathways. moreover, we found that adhesion levels of l. brevis to caco- <dig> cells were between 2% and 3%, similar to that detected for e. durans  <dig>   <cit> . we did not detect any influence of the ba biosynthetic pathways on l. brevis adhesion capability. however, we have only observed for l. brevis an increase of putrescine production in co-cultures of bacteria and epithelial human cells. thus, it seems that the role of the ba biosynthetic pathways of lactobacillus in the human git environment differs from that of enterococcus.

potential impact of l. brevis ioeb  <dig> on human health
with regard to the potential impact of l. brevis on human health, our results indicate that during transit through the stomach  as well as in contact with caco- <dig> cells  the bacteria could produce around  <dig>  mm tyramine . this should not be harmful for healthy individuals, since an average of  <dig> mg of orally administrated tyramine is required to increase systolic blood pressure  <cit> . however, tyramine can be particularly toxic to patients receiving monoamine oxidase  inhibitors. gastrointestinal mao is essential for the breakdown of tyramine and it has been reported that as little as  <dig> mg of tyramine is sufficient to produce hypertension in humans treated with mao inhibitors  <cit> . ethanol also inhibits mao. thus the expected low toxic effect due to low levels of tyramine produced by l. brevis during wine fermentation could be potentiated by the simultaneous ingestion of high ethanol content beverages. moreover, the production of putrescine by this bacterium could be also harmful. the polyamines, including putrescine, play a role in the maturation of the intestine, even when administrated orally  <cit> . polyamines administrated orally can act as growth factors with beneficial or detrimental effects, depending on their concentration  <cit>  and there is evidence suggesting that putrescine can cause malignancy in git cells  <cit> . it is estimated that the daily intake of polyamines in the diet is in the range of 350– <dig> μmol. thus, the amount of putrescine  produced by l. brevis in  <dig> h  <dig> min in the gastric environment seem to be of little concern. however, the  <dig> - <dig>  mm production of putrescine in the presence of caco- <dig> epithelial cells during  <dig> h, is more worrying, especially if l. brevis is able to colonize, even transiently, the small intestine.

CONCLUSIONS
l. brevis ioeb  <dig> produced both tyramine and putrescine under all conditions in an in vitro model that simulated the normal physiological conditions in the human digestive tract, as well as in the presence of caco- <dig> epithelial cells. under mild gastric stress bacterial survival improved in the presence of ba precursors and a synchronous transcriptional activation of the tyramine and putrescine biosynthetic pathways was detected. these results suggest that ba production may be a mechanism that increases bacterial survival under acid stress. the results also indicate that it may be possible for viable cells of l. brevis ioeb  <dig> to pass from the stomach into the duodenum.

l. brevis ioeb  <dig> cells were able to adhere to caco <dig> cells, which suggests that they may be able to adhere to human intestinal epithelium. however, this would not necessarily guarantee that l. brevis ioeb  <dig> would colonise the lower intestine as the impact of competition with other resident microorganisms, and the gut's innate defence mechanisms has not been assessed for this organism. high levels of both ba were observed after exposure of the bacterium to caco- <dig> cells.
