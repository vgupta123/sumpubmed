BACKGROUND
the spectacular species richness of cichlid fishes and their famous phenotypic diversity in terms of morphology, coloration, and behavior have made them a well-known textbook model system for the study of speciation and adaptive evolution  <cit> . the adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes in east africa are also renowned for their astonishingly fast rates of speciation  <cit> . the most species-rich endemic cichlid species flocks are made up entirely of species that belong to one particular lineage of cichlids known as the tribe haplochromini  <cit> . the adaptive radiation of cichlids in lake victoria has attracted particular attention of biologists because its ~ <dig> endemic species probably arose within less than  <dig>  years  <cit> , which translates to one of the fastest known rates of speciation  <cit> .

another fascinating aspect of cichlid evolution is the frequent occurrence of evolutionary parallelisms, where species from different lakes have independently evolved a remarkable phenotypic resemblance, converging on several traits, including coloration, body shape, and trophic morphology  <cit> . parallel morphological evolution has been considered to be strong evidence for similar regimes of natural selection being at work in driving diversification  <cit> . by studying repeated parallel evolution, the independent evolution of similar morphologies from a recent common ancestor in isolated and similar environments, we are investigating whether natural selection alone might be sufficient to produce these parallel morphologies, or whether genetic drift, geographic isolation, developmental or genetic bias has influenced the direction of diversification  <cit> . multiple crater lakes are an ideal system for the study of parallel evolution in body shape in cichlids where similar morphs have repeatedly evolved under comparable ecological niches  <cit> .

the crater lakes in southwestern uganda  represent one of the few natural experiments in which one can study whether independent parallel diversification took place after independent colonization events. this region of uganda is biologically almost completely unexplored. over  <dig> crater lakes were created in this area by extensive volcanic activity in the east african great rift valley. geologists date the earliest volcanic activity in this region to approximately  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . some of these lakes were established through temporal connections with nearby river systems. until now, only a few of these crater lakes  have been studied  <cit> , and each lake was found to contain one genetically and morphologically distinct haplochromine species . analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear markers  <cit>  suggested that these two new species are distinct, but originated from the same founding populations derived from the kazinga channel .figure  <dig>

based on these initial findings, it is reasonable to predict that more ugandan crater lakes might harbor endemic haplochromine cichlid species – making these lakes an interesting natural experiment that permits one to study the interaction between geographical isolation and natural selection promoting phenotypic diversification and speciation. each crater lake probably provides new and different habitats that are not found in the rivers or great lakes, such as clear and deep open water niches, each of which might exert similar selective regimes.

here, we report on the first phylogeographical investigation of the haplochromine cichlids of the ugandan crater lakes combining morphological and population genetic analyses. using both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers, we inferred the phylogeographic relationships among  <dig> lakes within the region . based on this, we also reconstructed the source populations as well as estimated time of colonization for each of the studied crater lakes. we then tested, using geometric morphometrics, whether independently colonized crater lakes, with characteristic larger pelagic zones, promoted the repeated evolution of limnetic-like body shapes from the ancestral deeper-bodied colonizing species.

strong genetic differentiation was found between crater lakes using both microsatellite and mtdna markers, in marked contrast to high levels of gene flow between the great rift valley lakes edwards and george  and the kazinga channel that connects them . high levels of genetic differentiation between lakes and regions were also suggested by means of a principal coordinate analysis  and the clustering pattern determined with structure . the most likely number of clusters was determined to be three, following evanno’s delta k correction procedure  <cit> . this suggests that there are three geographically distinct groups: one group composed of both great lakes and the river connecting them , one formed by the northern and central crater lakes , and one including the southwestern crater lakes . interestingly, further differentiation was detected when each of the previously mentioned clusters was analyzed separately. this is in agreement with high levels of differentiation found even within regions . the group affiliations are in concordance with the results found in the haplotype network .table  <dig>

central haplotypes in the haplotype network were almost exclusively from great lakes edward and george , supporting the hypothesis that these are the ancestral populations . moreover, three different mitochondrial lineages  were found corresponding to the geographically defined groups of crater lakes. most of the haplotypes found in the crater lakes were only a few mutations apart from the ancestral ones, providing evidence that these populations have diverged rather recently.

colonization time
most of the crater lake populations showed a distinctive pattern of population expansion , probably following colonization . however, this pattern was not so clear in the great lakes edward and george, where the population sizes seem to be more stable.table  <dig>

clear asymmetric gene flow was detected for all the crater lakes, with, as expected, a much higher effective migration from the great lakes  to the crater lakes than in the other direction . this pattern reinforces the idea that the great lakes george and edward were the older, larger and ancestral populations for the haplochromine cichlids that subsequently colonized the crater lakes of southwest uganda.

estimation of divergence times, together with the fact that three different mitochondrial lineages were found , suggests that there were at least three independent waves of colonization from the source population . the oldest colonization event took place around  <dig>  years ago to the crater lakes located geographically closer to the source lakes, those in the center  of the study area . fittingly, these lakes also contain the largest haplotype diversity among the haplochromine cichlids sampled . the older age of these crater lake haplochromine populations is also supported by the presence of many exclusive alleles and the fact that their private haplotypes are separated by several mutations in the haplotype network . the crater lakes located in the northern region of the study area  were colonized around  <dig>  years ago, whereas it seems that the geographically more distant lakes  were colonized more recently, around  <dig>  years ago. this pattern is also supported by the fact that southern crater lakes share some central haplotypes with the great lakes, suggesting a more recent divergence or several colonization events. based on the phylogenetic analyses of the microsatellite data, all southern crater lakes grouped together in a nj tree and were clearly separated from the central and northern lakes .table  <dig>

morphological differentiation
no morphological differentiation was detected among fish collected from the great lakes . however, a clear pattern of morphological differentiation was found between the haplochromine cichlids from the source and crater lake populations. no overlap was detected in the measured morphospace between the great lakes and the crater lakes except in a few individuals from the southern lakes .figure  <dig>

only one morphometric cluster was found for each crater lake, suggesting no intralacustrine differentiation. nevertheless, we found that haplochromine cichlids from the source and the young crater lakes have significantly different body shapes . crater lake cichlids have more shallow body shapes  relative to the great lake source cichlids . interestingly, this pattern of morphological differentiation between source and crater lakes was consistent for most of the pairwise comparisons  providing evidence for repeatedly evolved limnetic body shapes.

a positive correlation  between genetic  and morphometric  distance was found, suggesting that younger crater lakes  are more similar to the source populations.

discussion
we found clear evidence for strong genetic and morphological differentiation of haplochromine cichlid fishes from the crater lakes and the source lakes  in uganda. based on mitochondrial markers, at least three different waves of colonization were suggested to have occurred, coinciding with increased geological activity around  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . in addition to genetic differences, morphological differentiation was associated with the colonization of the ugandan crater lakes. crater lake fish are more slender than those from the shallow source lakes. thus, the repeated evolution of elongated body shapes is likely to be an adaptation to living in the open, clear and deep waters of crater lakes compared to the murky and shallow waters of their ancestral lakes and riverine habitats.

genetic differentiation
as expected, higher levels of genetic diversity were found in the great lakes than in the much younger crater lakes. the degree of genetic differentiation between crater lakes, even among those from the same region, supports a scenario in which each of the crater lakes constitutes a geographically isolated population. moreover, no intralacustrine differentiation was detected, and each crater lake  consists of only one genetic cluster based on the genetic marker set employed.

although based on only a relatively small number of individuals , clear genetic differentiation was found between riverine and crater lake haplochromine cichlids in lake mugogo , suggesting no gene flow between riverine and crater lake populations. consequently, our results indicate that these populations diverged mainly in allopatry, which is generally considered to be the most common and plausible mode of speciation  <cit> .

clear genetic and morphological differences exist between several lakes, suggesting that some of these crater lakes likely harbor undescribed and endemic haplochromine species. these findings should be corroborated by further taxonomic investigations.

colonization/parallelism
the observed patterns of genetic differentiation and asymmetric gene flow found with both kinds of genetic markers support at least three independent colonization events from the great lakes into sets of geographically-clustered crater lakes. this finding is in line with evidence from previous studies that suggest that two crater lakes within this region were colonized by the edward-kazinga-george system  <cit> . moreover, several central haplotypes were shared with those found in the older lake kivu, which was suggested to be ancestral to lake victoria  <cit> . interestingly, the central haplotype  <dig> that connects lake kivu  with lake victoria was suggested to be exclusive to lake kivu in previous studies, supporting the crucial role of lake kivu haplochromines in the evolution of the haplochromines of eastern africa  <cit> . however, in the present study we did find that this haplotype is also present in the edward-kazinga-george system, highlighting the relevance of this region during the stepwise colonization by haplochromine cichlids of the lake victoria region from the lake kivu region.

strikingly, every independent colonization event of ugandan crater lake cichlids was associated with a morphological change in the same direction - that is, the evolution of a more slender  body shape. an elongated, more streamlined body is usually associated with the exploitation of open water habitats  <cit> . moreover, the repeated pattern of phenotypic divergence in concert with the use of certain habitats has been taken as evidence for the important role of natural selection in the generation of diversity  <cit> . alternatively, only a limited set of phenotypes might be obtained in evolution, and the entire morphospace is not available for all lineages  <cit> . indeed, an eco-morphological differentiation along the limnetic-benthic axis is taxonomically widespread and has long been reported as the most common pattern of divergence in freshwater fishes  <cit> . also, divergence along a benthic to limnetic axis is common in cichlids  <cit>  and we are beginning to identify the genomic basis for such ecologically divergent body shapes  <cit> . in our case, even though phenotypic plasticity cannot be completely ruled out, it does not explain much of the variance in shape found when wild larvae fish are reared in the lab . clear morphological differentiation between lab-reared crater lake fish and fish from the source lakes was found . thus, crater lake fish reared in lab conditions maintain shallower body shapes than those of wild fish captured in the great lakes. altogether, this would suggest a genetic component of the elongated body shape characteristic of ugandan crater lake cichlids.

a scenario in which the riverine haplochromine had first differentiated into more elongated shape and later colonized the crater lakes cannot be completely discarded, however, it is rather unlikely due to the fact that all the haplochromine cichlids found in the ancestral lakes  have deeper body shapes, and that each of the three mitochondrial lineages  originated from the central haplotypes . moreover, riverine species inhabiting the proximity of the crater lakes were genetically different from the crater lake populations . unfortunately, the low number of riverine specimens included in this study precluded the proper geometric morphometric comparison between crater lake and riverine individuals.

no intralacustrine diversification
although clear genetic and morphological differentiation was found between each crater lake and the great lakes, no signal of intra-lacustrine diversification was detected. different factors, such as temporal and spatial variation, ecological opportunity, and lineage-specific features have been proposed to affect the propensity for intralacustrine radiation  <cit> .

obviously, linage-specific characteristics do not seem to cause the absence of divergence within ugandan crater lakes due to the fact that members of the same tribe, the haplochromine cichlids, have undergone some of the greatest radiations in other african lakes  <cit> .

a positive correlation between the size of the lake and its species richness is expected  <cit> . in general, one would expect that the area of a lake is positively correlated with higher environmental heterogeneity. hence, niche diversity would tend to increase with size as well as the opportunity for isolation by distance . even though ugandan crater lakes are generally very small , intralacustrine diversification has been found even in smaller crater lakes such as those in cameroon  <cit>  and nicaragua  <cit> . the estimates of divergence times are similar to those previously calculated for two other ugandan crater lakes  <cit> . it might be expected that because colonization occurred so recently , there has not been enough time to complete speciation within each lake. however, intralacustrine divergence in cichlid fishes has been detected in much younger lakes, such as neotropical and african crater lakes, where ecological speciation has been suggested  <cit> . possible reasons for the perceived lack of intralacustrine diversification in the ugandan crater lakes might be that deep, clear open-water niches, like those found in the nicaraguan crater lakes  <cit> , might be much smaller or missing in the very small and relatively shallow crater lakes of uganda.

CONCLUSIONS
a pattern of strong genetic and morphological differentiation was observed in the ugandan crater lakes, suggesting that this system might still harbor several undescribed endemic species. the patterns of colonization events suggest that lakes that are geographically close tend to be genetically more similar, and that crater lakes in three different geographic areas have been colonized by three independent waves of colonization. our data suggest that body shape changes have repeatedly evolved into a more limnetic-like form in several of these natural replicates. the observed morphological changes in ugandan crater lake cichlids are likely to result from a common selective regime.
