BACKGROUND
mercury is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that exists as either an organic or inorganic species that undergoes complex cycling in the environment and in vivo. humans are exposed to various forms of inorganic mercury including elemental mercury , mercury salts and ionic mercury . elemental mercury has long been used as a principal component of dental amalgams, resulting in the exposure of individuals wearing amalgams and dental professionals to mercury vapor. other occupational exposures to mercury vapor include workers in chloralkali plants, fluorescent lamp factories and artisanal gold mines  <cit> . exposure to mercury vapor can result in tremors; deficits in information processing speed, psychomotor speed and manual dexterity; psychological disturbances; and has been associated with alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . the kidney is also a primary site of accumulation and toxicity of inorganic mercury. environmental exposure to inorganic mercury is associated with an increase in mortality from kidney disease  <cit> .

inorganic mercury from natural and anthropogenic sources is converted to methylmercury. methylmercury biomagnifies, so that animals at the top of the food chain have methylmercury levels that are orders of magnitude higher than those at the bottom  <cit> . humans are exposed to methylmercury through fish consumption. it is estimated that 7% of u.s. women of childbearing age have levels of methylmercury that exceed the u.s. epa reference dose of  <dig>  μg/kg body weight/day  <cit> . methylmercury poisoning outbreaks in the 1950s and 1960s in the area surrounding minamata bay in japan resulted in paresthesia, ataxia, loss of vision, and death in adults  <cit> . what was particularly striking, however, was the sensitivity of the in utero life stage to methylmercury exposure. mothers with no overt toxicity gave birth to children with gross cognitive and anatomical defects  <cit> . a large epidemiological study investigating the effects of prenatal mercury exposure in populations that consume large amounts of seafood found a significant correlation between mothers’ mercury levels during gestation and cognitive deficits in children  <cit> .

previous research suggested that the inorganic mercurial, hgcl <dig>  and the organic mercurial, methylmercury chloride , had similar mechanisms of toxicity. it has been hypothesized that organic mercury is converted to the inorganic species and that the latter is the active form of the metal. both hgcl <dig> and mehgcl cause oxidative stress  <cit> . it is believed that oxidative stress is caused by the depletion of glutathione and other antioxidants, since neither mercurial is redox active in vivo <cit> . other proposed mechanisms of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl toxicity include microtubule disruption  <cit> , inhibition of mitochondrial function, and disruption of intracellular calcium levels  <cit> . microarray studies examining the effects of hgcl <dig> or mehgcl on gene expression found differential expression of genes involved in the oxidative stress response, protein degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress and phase ii metabolism  <cit> .

the results of previous toxicity studies suggest that hgcl <dig> and mehgcl act via similar mechanisms  <cit> . the few studies that have directly compared the effects of inorganic and methylmercury also suggest that the two mercurials have similar mechanisms of action. freitas, et al. found that both inorganic and methylmercury inhibit ca2+-atpase and disrupted ca2+ transport in brain microsomes  <cit> . both mercurials stimulated release of noradrenaline from rat hippocampal slices and had similar effects on inflammatory cytokine release in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit> .

in the present study, whole-genome microarrays were used to assess the effects of sub-, low- and high-toxicity concentrations of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl on the c. elegans transcriptome. to define the genes that are critical in the c. elegans response to mercurial exposure, rna interference  was used to assess the effect of gene knockdown on c. elegans growth during mercurial exposure. of the  <dig> genes tested, decreased expression of  <dig> genes significantly affected c. elegans growth in response to either mercurial. only two of these, however, significantly impacted growth during both hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposures. the effects of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl on the steady-state mrna levels of nine human homologs of c. elegans genes critical in the mercurial response were determined in human neuroblastoma , hepatocellular carcinoma , and embryonic kidney  cells. as was observed in c. elegans, hgcl <dig> and mehgcl produced unique responses on gene expression and different genes were critical in the cellular response. the current results demonstrate that inorganic and methylmercury differentially affect gene expression and that different genes are critical in the cellular response to the two mercurials. this suggests that, contrary to previous reports, inorganic and organic mercurials have unique mechanisms of action.

RESULTS
genes differentially expressed in response to mercurial exposure
the effects of mercurials on gene expression in c. elegans were assessed after exposure to sub-, low- and high-toxicity concentrations of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl. sub-, low- and high-toxicity concentrations were determined based on a previous study that compared the toxicity of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl on c. elegans growth, reproduction, feeding, and locomotion  <cit> . the effects of mercurials on the steady-state mrna levels of the c. elegans stress-response genes; gcs- <dig> , gst- <dig> , and heat shock protein genes hsp- <dig>  and hsp-70; were also assessed  <cit> . the population distribution of  <dig>  nematodes was determined for each mercurial exposure prior to rna isolation. no treatment groups had a population distribution different from untreated control. this ensured that differences in gene expression were not the result of changes in the number of c. elegans at any individual life stage .

a total of  <dig>  genes were significantly, differentially expressed among the six exposure conditions . exposure to increasing concentrations of both hgcl <dig> and mehgcl resulted in increasing numbers of differentially expressed genes . at each level of toxicity, however, mehgcl exposure produced a greater number of degs .

the five genes that had the largest increase or decrease in expression for each treatment condition are presented in table  <dig>  all degs are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the similarity among commonly up- and down-regulated genes at low- and high-toxicity mercurial exposures. very few genes were similarly affected by both hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposures. the only genes whose expression was affected at low- and high-toxicity exposures to both mercurials were ugt- <dig>  udp-glucuronosyl transferase, and c15b <dig> , an uncharacterized gene with high similarity to sarcosine oxidase. there were  <dig> up-regulated and eight down-regulated genes after exposure to each of the three mehgcl concentrations . among the three hgcl <dig> exposures the only up-regulated gene was metallothionein- <dig> . conversely, mtl- <dig> was down-regulated in response to all mehgcl exposures. qrt-pcr confirmed these microarray results, showing that mtl- <dig> was up-regulated by all hgcl <dig> treatments and down-regulated by mehgcl. similarly, mtl- <dig> was up-regulated at sub- and low-toxicity hgcl <dig> exposures, and down-regulated in low-toxicity mehgcl exposure .

principal components analysis  and hierarchical clustering were performed to determine the reproducibility of the mercurial-induced changes in the transcriptome, as well as visualize global effects of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl on c. elegans gene expression. pca with all genes showed tight spatial positioning of replicates indicating high experimental reproducibility . the first principal component, which accounted for 33% of the variation in the data, segregated by mercurial treatments, while the second principal component, which accounted for 22% of the variation, segregated by toxicity treatments or concentration. pca using only differentially expressed genes yielded similar results, but the first two principal components accounted for 85% of the variability .

consistent with the pca, the hierarchical clustering found high reproducibility in transcriptome changes for each of the mercurial treatments, indicating high quality data . hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes also found that the two mercurials had different effects on the c. elegans transcriptome . gene expression profiles for sub- and low-toxicity treated nematodes were similar for the individual mercurials. the effect of sub- and low-toxicity hgcl <dig> treatments on gene transcription was nearly opposite to the effect of sub- and low-toxicity mehgcl treatments. genes up-regulated by hgcl <dig> sub- and low-toxicity treatments were down-regulated by mehgcl treatments, and genes down-regulated by sub- and low-toxicity hgcl <dig> treatments were up-regulated by sub- and low-toxicity mehgcl treatments . the gene expression profiles for the high-toxicity exposures for hgcl <dig> and mehgcl were both dissimilar from the other treatments. there were, however, a small number of common differentially expressed genes at the highest hgcl <dig> and mehgcl concentrations. these may represent a general stress response that could be induced as the nematodes begin to succumb to mercurial toxicity. the pca and hierarchical clustering results suggest that changes in transcription are dictated largely by the type of mercurial.

microarray results were further analyzed to identify biological processes affected by the mercurials. differentially expressed genes were examined for enrichment in gene ontologies. table  <dig> lists the significantly enriched go biological processes for each mercurial treatment. for genes affected by high-toxicity hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposures, there was an enrichment of genes involved in lipid glycosylation and body morphogenesis. aside from this difference, there was very little overlap in enriched go processes between mercurials. there was not a significant enrichment of genes down-regulated in low-toxicity hgcl <dig> exposures. the lack of overlap in enriched go terms further indicated that hgcl <dig> and mehgcl had different effects on gene expression and affect unique biological processes.

co-expressed genes
the epig analysis tool identified gene expression patterns that differed between the two mercurials and the treatment concentrations and then categorized genes with similar patterns of transcription  <cit> . it has been proposed that genes with similar expression patterns across different treatment conditions may be co-regulated or involved in related biological processes. using data for all probes and mercurial treatment conditions,  <dig> unique expression patterns were generated . the number of genes assigned to each pattern varied from  <dig> genes  to  <dig> . in each pattern, hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposure had different effects on gene expression, which further demonstrated the extent to which hgcl <dig> and mehgcl had different effects on transcription. a list of the genes in the different epig patterns can be found in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

bioinformatics analyses of genes in different epig patterns elucidated the biological processes affected by hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposure. the efficacy of epig in grouping genes with related biological processes was evinced by the greater number of significantly enriched go categories relative to analysis of the total degs. among the  <dig> epig patterns, there were  <dig> significantly enriched go categories. by comparison, analysis of degs by treatment and differential expression yielded  <dig> significantly enriched go categories. examining the pattern-specific go categories defined how c. elegans responded to mercurials, and how these responses differed. the five most significantly enriched go biological processes for each epig pattern are listed in table  <dig>  all significantly enriched biological process and molecular function go categories are listed in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

the go category embryonic development associated with birth or egg hatching was significantly enriched in epig patterns  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  however, that ontology comprised  <dig>  genes, which were involved in a variety of functions. patterns  <dig> and  <dig> included genes that were up-regulated in response to hgcl <dig>  but were down-regulated or not affected by mehgcl. in both patterns, there was an enrichment of genes in the metal transport go category, which included a number of potassium channels . potassium channels have been reported to be inhibited by hgcl <dig> and unaffected by mehgcl exposure  <cit> . it is possible that hgcl <dig>  but not mehgcl, inhibited potassium channel activity in c. elegans, and that the nematode responded by increased transcription of the affected proteins. however, further investigation is required to determine if this is the case.

pattern  <dig> comprised  <dig> genes that were down-regulated in response to hgcl <dig> and up-regulated in response to mehgcl. there was a significant enrichment of genes in the protein catabolic process, including components of the proteasome , ubiquitin ligases , and ubiquitin-specific proteases . this suggested that nematodes responded to an increase in the level of methylmercury-damaged proteins by up-regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

pattern  <dig> contained  <dig> genes whose levels of expression increased at high-toxicity mehgcl exposures, but were largely unaffected by sub- and low-toxicity mehgcl and all hgcl <dig> exposures. the most significantly enriched go was trna aminoacylation for protein translation, which included the trna synthetases for asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, methionine, serine, tyrosine and valine. mehgcl inhibits protein synthesis, which has been attributed to the ability of mehgcl to disrupt aminoacyl-trna synthetase activity  <cit> . the data in this report suggested that nematodes increased transcription of aminoacyl-trna synthetases to compensate for the inhibition of these enzymes by mehgcl.

functional analysis of mercury-responsive c. elegans genes
exposure to hgcl <dig> and mehgcl resulted in the up-regulation of hundreds of c. elegans genes. we hypothesized that up-regulated genes were likely to be important in protecting c. elegans against mercurial toxicity. to investigate this hypothesis, rnai was used to assess the effects of knocking down gene expression on c. elegans growth in the presence of hgcl <dig> or mehgcl. genes whose level of expression increased > 2-fold under all hgcl <dig> exposure conditions and the sub- and low-toxicity mehgcl exposures were selected. in addition, genes whose level of expression increased > 5-fold at the high-toxicity mehgcl exposure were selected. using these selection criteria,  <dig> genes were tested, which included  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes that were up-regulated by hgcl <dig>  mehgcl, and both mercurials, respectively.

gene-mercurial interactions were tested for both mercurials for all genes. an interaction was identified when gene knockdown and mercurial exposure resulted in growth that was significantly different from the predicted additive effects of the independent mercurial exposure and knockdown in gene expression.

in the initial screen, significant gene-mercurial interactions to at least one mercurial for  <dig> genes were observed. the effect on growth of knocking down these genes concomitant with mercurial exposure was then quantitatively assessed. for each gene-mercurial combination, interaction parameters and p-values were calculated. a positive interaction parameter indicated that nematodes exposed to mercurial and dsrna had greater than predicted growth . a negative interaction indicated that nematodes exposed to both mercurial and dsrna had less than predicted growth .

eighteen genes showed significant gene-mercurial interactions . genes that had positive gene-mercurial interactions included those encoding choline kinase , an f-box a protein , an atp-binding cassette transporter , and a c-type lectin . genes that had negative gene-mercurial interactions included genes encoding: γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase , a member of the tetraspanin integral membrane protein family , a poly-adp-ribose metabolism enzyme , an f-box a protein , and a long-chain fatty acid elongation enzyme . the remaining genes have limited information related to their function. of the  <dig> significant interactions, two genes showed significant gene-mercurial interactions with both mercurials: gcs- <dig> and f14f <dig> , which encodes a hypothetical protein. the remaining gene-mercurial interactions were mercurial-specific. the results of all c. elegans gene-mercurial interactions are listed in additional file 5: table s <dig>

effect of mercurials on gene expression in human cells
results with c. elegans indicated that transcriptional responses varied by type of mercurial. to determine if a similar response occurred in human cells, the effects of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposure on transcription in three human-derived cell lines: sk-n-sh, hepg <dig> and hek <dig> were examined. the effects on the steady state mrna levels of human homologs to c. elegans genes for which there were significant gene-mercurial interactions were determined: abcg <dig> , a transporter that exports chemotherapeutic agents from cells and is up-regulated in many cancers  <cit> ; bace <dig> , the rate limiting enzyme for the production of β-amyloid peptide  <cit> ; bace <dig>  a bace <dig> homolog, though less is known about its function; choline kinases chka and chkb , generate phosphocholine  <cit> ; elovl <dig> and elovl <dig> , synthesize saturated and mono-unsaturated long-chain fatty acids  <cit> ; gclc , glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit for the rate limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis  <cit> ; and parg , catalyzes the hydrolysis of poly-  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> cell line-mercurial concentration-gene combinations were tested. of these,  <dig> resulted in a significant affect on gene expression, and every gene was differentially expressed in at least one condition . interestingly, while the c. elegans homologs of these genes were all up-regulated in response to at least one mercurial, many of the human homologs were down-regulated. this was evident in the hepg <dig> cells, where parg, elovl <dig>  bace <dig>  chka, chkb, and abcg <dig> were down-regulated in response to mehgcl exposure. there were also cell line specific responses to mercurial exposure. for example, bace <dig> was up-regulated at the hgcl <dig> ec <dig> and ec <dig> in sk-n-sh cells, but was down-regulated at the ec <dig> in hek <dig> cells.

the number in each cell indicates the fold-change in expression. cells containing ”-“ indicate no significant change in gene expression.

as was observed in c. elegans, hgcl <dig> and mehgcl had different effects on transcription. for example, in hepg <dig> cells, both ec <dig> and ec <dig> mehgcl treatments resulted in an ~10-fold increase in elovl <dig> levels, while hgcl <dig> exposure had no effect on elovl <dig> mrna levels. of the  <dig> conditions that resulted in a significant change in gene expression,  <dig> were unique to a specific cell line-mercurial combination. there were six conditions where both mercurials, at equitoxic concentrations, induced similar changes in gene expression. in sk-n-sh cells, chkb was up-regulated by ec <dig> exposures to both mercurials, and in hek <dig> cells, elovl <dig> was up-regulated by ec <dig> exposures to both mercurials. in hepg <dig> cells, gclc was up-regulated by noael and ec <dig> hgcl <dig> and mehgcl treatments, while elovl <dig> and chka were down-regulated by ec <dig> and noael treatments, respectively. there were no instances in which a gene was significantly up-regulated by one mercurial and significantly down-regulated by the other. overall, these results were similar to that observed in c. elegans, where hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposure showed metal-specific effects on gene expression.

functional analysis of gene-mercurial interactions of human homologs
a subset of c. elegans genes up-regulated in response to mercurial exposure was found to be important in the nematode response to mercurial exposure. to determine if the human homologs of these genes also affected the mammalian response to mercurial exposure, the effect of gene knockdown on the viability of sk-n-sh, hepg <dig> and hek <dig> cells after a 24 h exposure to estimated ec <dig> mercurial concentrations was determined. there was no detectable abcg <dig> expression in sk-n-sh cells, and bace <dig> was not significantly knocked down in sk-n-sh and hepg <dig> cells, therefore these conditions were not tested. in all other cases, sirna treatment resulted in a significant decrease in target mrna .

as with the c. elegans rnai experiment, genes were deemed critical to the cells’ response to mercurial exposure if there was a significant gene-mercurial interaction. a positive interaction indicated more than expected viable cells, and a negative interaction indicated fewer than expected viable cells. there were  <dig> significant interactions . there were no significant interactions with either mercurial for bace <dig>  bace <dig>  or chkb in any cell line. there were no instances in which a gene-cell line combination resulted in a significant interaction with both hgcl <dig> and mehgcl. ten of the significant interactions were negative, with only knockdown of elovl <dig> in hgcl2-treated hepg <dig> cells resulting in a positive interaction. this interaction resulted in a 58% increase in viable cells, which was the largest magnitude change of any gene-mercurial interaction. knockdown of elovl <dig> resulted in negative interactions in hgcl2-treated sk-n-sh cells and mehgcl-treated hek <dig> cells, and had no effect in mercurial-treated hepg <dig> cells. knockdown of chka in mehgcl-exposed cells resulted in a negative interaction in all three cell lines. however, significant chka-hgcl <dig> interactions were not observed. knockdown of abcg <dig> in mehgcl-exposed cells resulted in negative interactions in hepg <dig> and hek <dig> cells. all other gene-mercurial interactions were cell line-specific. there was a significant gclc-mercurial effect only in sk-n-sh cells treated with hgcl <dig> and hepg <dig> cells treated with mehgcl. as the gclc homolog, gcs- <dig>  was the most critical resistance gene to both mercurials in c. elegans, it was expected that similar results would be observed in cell culture. as was observed in c. elegans, different genes are critical in the cellular response to different mercurials.

significant  positive and negative gene-mercurial interactions are highlighted in bold. numbers in cells indicate the percent change in viable cells from predicted additive effect of gene knock-down and mercurial exposure. “na” indicates a condition that was not tested.

discussion
in the present study, global transcriptome profiles for c. elegans exposed to sub-, low- and high-toxicity concentrations of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl were compared. the use of three equitoxic levels of mercurial allowed for a more relevant comparison of the effects. after demonstrating the differences in c. elegans responses to hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposure, the role of selected genes in mercurial response was assessed in three human cell lines. in both c. elegans and mammalian cells, hgcl <dig> and mehgcl exposure had unique effects on gene expression, and different genes were important in protecting the organism from mercurial toxicity.

at each equitoxic exposure, there were a greater number of degs in mehgcl-treated c. elegans than in hgcl2-treated. furthermore, at each level of toxicity, there was a higher percentage of degs down-regulated by mehgcl, compared to hgcl2: sub-toxicity , low-toxicity , high-toxicity . high percentages  of degs were down-regulated in response to mehgcl in studies using mouse embryo fibroblasts  <cit> . in contrast, microarray analysis of livers from hgcl2-exposed zebrafish found approximately equal numbers of up- and down-regulated genes, and analysis of hg0-exposed rat lungs found more up-regulated than down-regulated genes  <cit> .

one of the most striking results of the present study was the degree to which the transcriptomes of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl differed. there were very few common degs between mercurial exposures. pca indicated that more variability was attributed to the mercurial species than the level of toxicity . similarly, hierarchical clustering of degs at sub-and low-toxicity concentrations showed almost opposite transcriptional responses for hgcl <dig> and mehgcl . at high-toxicity exposures, when cellular stress is elevated, one would expect similarities in the degs. there were  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated common degs following exposure to high-toxicity concentrations of hgcl <dig> and mehgcl. while the majority of these genes were poorly characterized, there were several known stress-response genes: seven udp-glucuronosyl transferases, six glutathione s-transferases, and a heat shock protein. the common degs, however, represented less than  <dig> % of the total number of degs. the differences in the hgcl <dig> and mehgcl transcriptomes suggest that the two mercurials have different mechanisms of action.

hgcl <dig> and mehgcl differed in the number of positive and negative gene-mercurial interactions. of the  <dig> genes for which there was a gene-mercurial interaction, only two interacted with both hgcl <dig> and mehgcl. of the ten significant gene-mehgcl interactions, eight resulted in increased susceptibility to mehgcl. conversely, of the ten significant gene-hgcl <dig> interactions, nine resulted in increased tolerance to hgcl <dig>  the differences in direction of the gene-mercurial interactions between the two mercurials and the paucity of similar gene-mercurial interactions were further evidence that the two mercurials acted through unique mechanisms at the molecular level.

metallothionein binding of inorganic metals is a common detoxification mechanism. therefore, increased mrna levels were expected following mercurial exposure. the c. elegans metallothionein genes, mtl- <dig> and mtl- <dig>  were up-regulated in response to hgcl <dig> exposure. they were however, down-regulated following mehgcl exposure. previous publications in a variety of species report inconsistent induction of metallothioneins in response to mehgcl exposure  <cit> . the present study is the first to report a down-regulation of metallothionein gene expression in response to mehgcl exposure. although earlier studies showed that metallothioneins were incapable of binding methylmercury  <cit> , more recent work indicated that metallothioneins could bind methylmercury  <cit> . in addition to binding metals, metallothioneins are also important in regulating the redox status of cells and preventing intracellular oxidative damage. metallothioneins increase resistance to mehgcl toxicity, possibly by protecting cellular components from mercurial-induced oxidative stress  <cit> . these data suggest that the increased sensitivity of c. elegans to mehgcl may be a consequence of its inability to induce metallothionein expression in response to this mercurial.

in mehgcl-exposed c. elegans, decreased metallothionein levels likely result in increased reliance on glutathione-mediated detoxification. in the low-toxicity mehgcl treatment,  <dig> glutathione s-transferases were up-regulated. conversely, no glutathione s-transferases were up-regulated in the low-toxicity hgcl <dig> exposure. in high-toxicity treatments, there were  <dig> glutathione s-transferases up-regulated in mehgcl-exposed nematodes and seven in hgcl2-exposed nematodes. in addition, knockdown of gcs- <dig> increased c. elegans susceptibility to both mercurials; however, the effect was greater in mehgcl-exposed nematodes . the human homolog of gcs- <dig>  gclc, was also critical in resistance to both mercurials in mammalian cells. knockdown of gclc resulted in significant negative interactions with hgcl <dig> in sk-n-sh and mehgcl in hepg <dig> cells. glutathione is important in resistance to both hgcl <dig> and mehgcl, but mehgcl-exposed c. elegans appear to be particularly dependent on glutathione-mediated resistance. gene expression and knockdown results with both c. elegans and human cells suggest that glutathione may be a component of an evolutionarily conserved defense against mercurial  toxicity.

co-exposure of parg sirna and mehgcl in hek <dig> cells resulted in the second largest observed gene-mercurial interaction, indicating the critical role of parg in resistance to mehgcl toxicity. in contrast, there were no significant parg-hgcl <dig> interactions in any cell line. parp  catalyzes the addition of adp-ribose to proteins, while parg cleaves poly-adp-ribose to adp-ribose monomers  <cit> . in cases of severe stress, parp becomes highly activated, which leads to over-production of poly-adp-ribose and cell death  <cit> . this suggests that exposure to mehgcl increases parp activity, and that parg is necessary to maintain poly-adp-ribose homeostasis. treatment with the parp inhibitor  <dig>  4-dihydro-5--1-isoquinolinone decreased mehgcl-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner  <cit> . pme- <dig>  the c. elegans parg homolog, was up-regulated 22-fold in low-toxicity and 35-fold in high-toxicity mehgcl exposures. in addition, pme- <dig> knockdown during mehgcl exposure resulted in the fourth greatest negative interaction, however, pme- <dig> knockdown during hgcl <dig> exposure did not produce a significant interaction. pme- <dig> is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons, and is predicted to be critical in preventing neurodegeneration  <cit> . methylmercury is a neurotoxicant, thus pme- <dig> may be critical in maintaining neuron viability in mehgcl-exposed nematodes. these results suggest that disruption of poly-adp-ribose homeostasis may be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of mehgcl, but not hgcl <dig>  toxicity.

elo- <dig> was important in resistance to mehgcl, though it was down-regulated  <dig> -fold in the high-toxicity mehgcl exposure. elo- <dig> is a long-chain fatty acid elongation enzyme that plays an essential role in growth of c. elegans <cit> . there is evidence that suggests exposure to poly-unsaturated fatty acids mitigates mehgcl toxicity in humans  <cit> .

epig pattern  <dig> was populated by genes down-regulated by hgcl <dig> and up-regulated by low- and high-toxicity mehgcl exposures. there was a significant enrichment of genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system in this group. in yeast, increased ubiquitination resulted in increased resistance to mehgcl toxicity  <cit> . in addition, mehgcl-exposed mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed an enrichment of differentially expressed genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. these authors suggested that the removal of methylmercury-damaged proteins is critical for cell survival  <cit> . recent work indicates that ubiquitination inhibits neuronal exit in cerebellar granule cell layers  <cit> . patients suffering from minamata disease exhibited hypoplasia of granule cell layer and degeneration of cerebellar granule cells, which may be due in part to mehgcl inhibition of granule cell migration  <cit> . it is reasonable to hypothesize that increased ubiquitination, while protective against mehgcl in some cell types, may contribute to the neuropathology of methylmercury exposure by inhibiting granule cell migration.

in the present study, considerable differences were observed on how exposure to different mercurials affects gene expression and the genes that mediate the organism’s response to mercury. these differences were observed in both c. elegans and human cell lines, demonstrating the conserved nature of this phenomenon. while there are many instances in which a specific gene was differentially expressed in response to only one mercurial there were no instances in which a gene was up-regulated by one mercurial and down-regulated by the other. these results suggest that, despite similarities in the known responses of the two mercurials, the two mercurials function differently at the molecular level. these data indicate that contrary to previous models that hypothesize the conversion of organic mercury to the inorganic species, organic and inorganic mercurials act by independent or unique molecular mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
mercury is an environmental human toxicant that exists in multiple chemical forms. despite years of research, only a fragmented understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mercurial toxicity exists. furthermore, it is not known whether different mercurial species act similarly or dissimilarly at the molecular level. we performed microarray analysis of c. elegans exposed to three equitoxic concentrations of mercuric chloride  and methylmercury chloride . bioinformatics analysis indicated that the transcriptional effects of the two mercurials were vastly different. next, we examined the effects of knocking down the expression of up-regulated genes on c. elegans growth. of the ~ <dig> genes tested, only two significantly affected growth in response to both mercurials. we examined the evolutionarily conserved nature of the mercurial response in three human-derived cell lines. similar to what was observed in c. elegans, there was very little overlap in the transcriptional responses between hgcl <dig> and mehgcl. there was also very little overlap between the mercurials in the genes involved in resistance and susceptibility. these data indicate that contrary to previous models that hypothesize the conversion of organic mercury to the inorganic species, which is the active form of the metal, organic and inorganic mercurials function by independent or unique molecular mechanisms.
