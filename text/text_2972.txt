BACKGROUND
campylobacter spp. are recognized as the leading human foodborne pathogens in developed countries  <cit> . within the genus campylobacter, the thermophilic species campylobacter jejuni  and campylobacter coli  are the most frequently associated with illness, accounting for over 95% of infections   <cit> . these two species commonly live in the intestinal tract of birds and mammals, including food production animals and pets, without causing clinical signs  <cit> . livestock animals carrying campylobacter pose an important risk for human infection from contamination of carcasses at slaughter, of milk, and water contaminated by livestock wastes and slurries  <cit> . research carried out in europe has shown the dominance of c. jejuni in animal intestinal tracts, for example, broiler chickens, cattle, and wild-living mammals and birds  <cit> . pigs are known to be frequently infected with campylobacter , to exhibit high counts of this pathogen in their faeces  of campylobacter per gram), and to show a dominance of c. coli  <cit> . nevertheless, some studies have found a dominance of c. jejuni in pigs and of c. coli in chickens  <cit> . given these contradictory data, the risk of foodborne disease associated with animal species is not clear. in terms of risk assessment, the ability to differentiate and quantify these two species is essential to describe more precisely the presence of campylobacter in livestock animals.

the identification of campylobacter using conventional methods is slow  and problematic due to their fastidious growth requirements and biochemical inertness  <cit> . moreover, the detection of c. coli and/or c. jejuni in complex substrates like faeces or environmental samples is difficult as the culture conditions have to be selective enough to avoid overgrowth from competiting organisms. additionally these bacteria may enter into a viable but nonculturable state   <cit> . the correct differentiation of thermophilic campylobacter spp., especially c. coli and c. jejuni, by phenotypic tests is difficult and hippurate hydrolysis test used to distinguish these two species is often problematic  <cit> . furthermore, c. jejuni may also coexist with c. coli in pigs, but at 10-100-fold lower numbers than c. coli  <cit> , so c. jejuni will be less frequently isolated from such samples because only a few colonies are identified to the species level with conventional culturing and biochemical testing techniques. molecular methods are an alternative to the bacteriological method for the detection of c. coli and c. jejuni in various substrates  <cit> . real-time pcr has provided a reliable tool to detect and to quantify c. jejuni and/or c. coli in pure culture  <cit> , in poultry, milk, or water  <cit> , and in complex substrates like food products  <cit>  and faecal samples  <cit> . however, of the real-time pcr techniques developed, none were capable of differentiating and quantifying c. coli and c. jejuni directly from pig faecal, feed, and environmental samples.

the present study aimed to develop a species-specific real-time pcr method to detect and quantify c. coli and c. jejuni directly in pig faecal, feed, and environmental samples. the first step in the development of the assay was the definition of the multiplex pcr assay to quantify c. coli and c. jejuni isolates from bacterial cultures. these real-time pcr assays were coupled with a modified dna extraction protocol and then examined for their ability:  to evaluate dna purification with different parameters ,  to measure the sensitivity and the specificity of pcr-based detection in faecal samples, and  to detect c. jejuni among predominant c. coli. finally, the last step was the application of the real-time pcr assays to detect and quantify c. coli and c. jejuni in complex substrates like feed, environmental samples, and faeces from experimentally as well as naturally infected pigs. the bacterial culture was used as a gold standard for their validation.

RESULTS
specificity, sensitivity and linear range of the real-time pcr assays
the specificity of each primers-probe set for the detection of c. coli and c. jejuni was tested against different strains of c. coli  and c. jejuni , all of which were correctly identified. moreover, no signal was observed for any of the other campylobacter species tested as well as for a range of bacteria, which could be present in faecal samples or responsible for diarrhoea in pigs and humans . finally, the specificity of each real-time pcr assay was characterized for samples using the stool-screening strategy described previously by lagier et al.   <cit> . the dna extracted from the  <dig> campylobacter-negative faecal, feed, and environmental samples and examined in duplicate with each real-time pcr assays produced threshold cycle  values ≥  <dig> when  <dig> μl of extracted dna was used as the starting template. all samples in which both duplicates had a ct value below this threshold were regarded as positive.

to determine the linear range of the real-time pcr assay, standard curves of the template dna, in units of genome copy number, were generated for c. coli  and for c. jejuni . we observed a strong linear correlation , providing an accurate measurement over a large variety of starting target amounts . the detection limits of the real-time pcr assays for genomic dna were three genome copies per pcr reaction for c. coli and ten genome copies per pcr reaction for c. jejuni . moreover, the reaction is reliable with a detection limit of ten genome copies for the samples containing both c. jejuni and c. coli dna  and for  <dig> successive real-time pcr assays. the standard curves showed linearity over the entire quantitation range and spanned eight and seven orders of magnitude for c. coli and c. jejuni detection, respectively. finally, the real-time pcr assays had an efficiency of 99% to detect c. jejuni and c. coli whether alone  or together in a same sample .

precision of the c. jejuni and c. coli real-time pcr assays
to obtain values for the intra- and inter-assay variation of each real-time pcr assay, purified genomic dna from  <dig> to  <dig> genome copies per pcr reaction was subjected to each real-time pcr in ten duplicates, with  <dig> different mixes performed on different runs. the results are presented in table  <dig>  the coefficients of variation  of the ct values for the ten different intra-assay experiments ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for c. coli real-time pcr and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for c. jejuni real-time pcr. the mean standard curves were y = - <dig> x +  <dig>  with r <dig> =  <dig>  for c. coli pcr and y = - <dig> x +  <dig>  with r <dig> =  <dig>  for c. jejuni pcr. the cv of the ct values for the inter-assay variation ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, respectively for c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays. the mean standard curves were y = - <dig> x +  <dig>  for the c. coli real-time pcr and y = - <dig> x +  <dig>  for the c. jejuni real-time pcr.

the coefficients of variation  of the threshold cycles values  were evaluated for the c. coli real-time pcr  and for the c. jejuni real-time pcr . for each cvc and cvj, the range of ct , which corresponds to the smallest and the highest values of the ct found among the ten, was indicated for each dilution for both intra-and inter-assay testings.

 <dig> results of intra-assay testing: ten replicates of each sample were tested in one pcr run

 <dig> results of inter-assay testing: one replicate of each sample was tested once in each of ten different pcr runs

validation of the real time pcr assays for the analysis of faecal, feed, and environmental samples spiked with c. coli and c. jejuni
samples were checked for pcr inhibition in a separate test using a bacterial internal amplification and extraction control  <cit> . inhibitors of real-time pcr were identified in 4% of the examined samples, which were consequently removed from the quantification study.

the detection limit for the quantitative real-time pcr assays in spiked faecal samples were  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu of c. coli/g of faeces and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu of c. jejuni/g of faeces , similar to that of the bacteriological method. although this assay was able to detect lower quantities between  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu of campylobacter/g of faeces, the regression curve was only linear from about  <dig> to  <dig> cfu with reaction volumes of  <dig> μl . for the feed samples, the detection limits were slightly lower . for the environmental samples, they were around  <dig> cfu/m <dig> for both species and both sampling sites . for both species, the standard curves showed linearity from about  <dig> to  <dig> cfu and  <dig> to  <dig> cfu for feed and environmental samples respectively.

to obtain values for the intra- and inter-assay variation of each real-time pcr assay with field samples, dna extracted from the campylobacter-negative spiked faecal samples was subjected to each real-time pcr in ten duplicates, with  <dig> different mixes performed on different runs. the results are reported in table  <dig>  the cv of the ct values for the ten different intra-assay experiments ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for c. coli real-time pcr and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for c. jejuni real-time pcr. the standard curves were y = - <dig> x +  <dig>  with r <dig> =  <dig>  for c. coli and y = - <dig> x +  <dig>  with r <dig> =  <dig>  for c. jejuni. the cv of the ct values for the ten different inter-assay experiments, including the dna extraction procedure, ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % respectively for c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays. the mean standard curves were y = - <dig> x +  <dig>  and y = - <dig> x +  <dig>  respectively.

analysis of faecal samples of experimentally infected pigs
the numbers of positive and negative samples for experimentally infected pigs determined by either real-time pcr or bacteriological method are summarized in table  <dig>  there was an excellent correlation at the qualitative level with both techniques with a kappa of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively for c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays. indeed, for c. jejuni experimentally infected pigs, only two culture-positive samples were negative by real-time pcr, and one culture-negative sample was positive by real-time pcr . in addition, for pigs experimentally infected with c. coli, only one culture-negative sample was positive by real-time pcr and inversely .

the estimate of campylobacter cfu/g of faeces by both c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays was compared to the bacteriological enumeration method . we observed a good correlation between real-time pcr and culture at the quantitative level for experimentally infected pig samples both for c. coli real-time pcr  and for c. jejuni real-time pcr . among the pcr-culture positive samples for the experimentally infected pig,  <dig> % of the samples had a difference in cell number of less than  <dig> log, 25% of less than  <dig> logs, and  <dig> % of less than  <dig>  logs for c. coli real-time pcr assay. for c. jejuni real-time pcr assay, the results obtained by real-time pcr matched equally the results obtained by culture: 67% of the samples had a difference in cell number of less than  <dig> log, 29% of less than  <dig> logs, and 4% of less than  <dig> logs.

analysis of field samples of naturally contaminated pigs
no c. jejuni was identified among the faecal, feed, and environmental samples from the different pig herds by conventional pcr or by our c. jejuni real-time pcr assay. conversely, all the campylobacter tested were identified as c. coli by both methods.

the specificity and the sensitivity for the c. coli real-time pcr assay with the different field samples are reported in table  <dig>

 <dig>  sensitivity se =  <dig> %, specificity sp =  <dig> %, kappa k =  <dig> 

for the different field samples tested, the quantification results obtained by c. coli real-time pcr matched equally the results obtained by bacterial culture: 58% of the samples had a difference in cell number of less than  <dig> log, 37% of less than  <dig> logs, and 5% of less than  <dig> logs.

discussion
the real-time pcr asays developed in this study provide an effective, rapide, and sensitive alternative method to culture-based methods for the detection and the quantification of c. coli and c. jejuni in pure cultures and in complex samples.

to use real-time pcr for quantitative measurements and to ensure a correct quantification, information on both linear range and amplification efficiency of the real-time pcr assay must be available. with a quantitative detection limit of  <dig> genome copies, an amplification efficiency of 99%, and a linear range of seven to eight orders of magnitude, the c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays allowed a precise quantification of c. coli or c. jejuni dna amounts extracted from pure culture preparations. the specificity of the assays was assessed  by the species-specific amplification of dna from different field strains/isolates of c. coli and c. jejuni, and  by the absence of amplification from dna isolated from  <dig> pig faecal, feed, and environmental samples previously determined to be campylobacter-free by culture. the real-time pcr assays were also shown to be highly specific since no pcr amplicons were detected when the method was applied to dna from different bacterial reference strains, including different campylobacter species, campylobacter-related bacteria, and other bacteria. both intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation of the ct values for the purified genomic dna were satisfactorily low and in concordance with those reported for other molecular assays based on pcr amplification  <cit> . they confirmed the reliability and the accuracy of the technical setup over time and over the complete range of quantification.

the technique was developed to detect and quantify c. coli and/or c. jejuni directly in pig faecal, feed, and environmental samples. in order to determine the detection limits of c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays for field samples, campylobacter-negative faecal samples were spiked with 10-fold dilutions of the campylobacter suspensions of each reference strain . standard curves for environmental and feed samples were constructed in a similar way. the established c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays proved highly sensitive  and were linear over a range of six orders of magnitude . both intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation of the ct values for the dna extracted from campylobacter-negative faecal samples did not differ significantly. this may indicate that the main reason for variation is not due to pipetting errors in setting up the pcr assay but may be caused by contaminants from the fecal samples. nevertheless, we did not observe systematically lower cv values of intra- and inter-assay variations with purified genomic dna. this does not support the hypothesis that inhibitors and contaminants may interfere with uniform and consistent dilution as well as the amplification of target dna.

samples tested in this study constitute complex biological substrates due to the presence of  numerous types of bacteria,  different kinds of inhibitors, and  food degradation products  <cit> . moreover, contrary to faecal and caecal chicken samples  <cit> , the consistency and the composition of pig faecal samples are highly variable and heterogeneous  between individuals,  over time according to the age of the animals, and  depending on the diet components in the same way as for cattle faeces  <cit> . in this study, we sampled faeces of sows, piglets, weaners, and finishers, exhibiting considerable heterogeneity . all these variables may have an impact on the dna extraction process and inhibitor removal, affecting the quality and the quantity of dna obtained, thereby limiting the sensitivity of molecular studies. the modified sample preparation procedure, which included  a large volume of faeces ,  a boiling step known to remove inhibitors of the taq polymerase  <cit> , and  the use of a dna extraction kit, allowed a better homogenization of the faeces and achieved partial removal of inhibitors. no difference was noticed between real-time pcr assays and culture at both qualitative and quantitative levels for faecal samples differing by the composition, the consistency, or the age of the sampled animal . nevertheless, in this study, the potential presence of pcr inhibitory compounds was in parallel assessed with the use of an internal bacterial control of extraction and amplification in a separate real-time pcr test  <cit> . inhibitors of real-time pcr were identified only in 4% of the examined samples, which were consequently removed from the quantification study. moreover, the dna extraction step reproducibility, an important parameter when evaluating the dna purification  <cit> , was satisfactory proved with the low cv values of the inter-assay variability including the dna extraction procedure.

three faecal samples of experimentally infected pigs, detected as negative by pcr and direct streaking, were positive by culture after an enrichment step  leading to a sensitivity of  <dig> % and  <dig> %. although the internal control was positive, we cannot exclude the hypothesis of inhibition of c. coli and c. jejuni amplification. indeed, it was previously reported that some pcr primers are more markedly affected than others by impurities present in dna preparations  <cit> . moreover, it could be false negative pcr samples, which have been below the detection limit of the two real-time pcr assays. genetic variability among the isolates of campylobacter spp., which has been demonstrated previously  <cit> , can also affect the efficacy of a pcr if changes occur within one or both of the binding sites  <cit> . the enrichment step enhanced the sensitivity of the bacteriological method by lowering the detection limit. nevertheless, even if it is helpful for poorly contaminated samples, researchers have reported several cases in which c. jejuni signals detected by direct pcr disappeared after enrichment. conversely c. coli signals were maintained when present before enrichment, or else became detectable when undetectable before enrichment  <cit> . this suggests that the enrichment media may favour the growth of one campylobacter species comparatively to the other  <cit> .

furthermore, for the experimentally infected pigs, only one culture-negative faecal sample was positive by real-time pcr for each target leading to a specificity of  <dig> % for both c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays. these results may be due to the presence of viable but nonculturable  forms or dead bacteria cells, since dna-based tests detect all dna of the extract from live as well as dead bacteria  <cit> . if this is the case, it is another advantage of these real-time pcr assays as campylobacter cells in a vbnc state may potentially be still infectious  <cit> . the bacteriological method may also explain these results given that the sensitivity of culture may vary depending on the campylobacter spp. due to differences in susceptibility to antibiotics present in selective agar  <cit> . moreover, in pig faceal and environmental samples, the enrichment of c. jejuni could be difficult due to the presence of a high background flora and due to the more numerous c. coli quantity  <cit> .

finally, for the faecal samples of experimentally infected pigs, we observed a good correlation at the quantitative level between culture enumeration and quantitative pcr for both c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays . among the pcr-culture positive samples, the real-time pcr quantification seems to be accurate compared to the culture enumeration used as a gold standard. indeed, more than 95% of the samples with a difference in cell number of less than  <dig> logs, of these  <dig> % and 67% less than  <dig> log respectively for c. coli and c. jejuni real-time pcr assays. the observed discrepancy might be due to the possible presence of vbnc forms, dead cells and antagonistic bacterial species. another possibility could be the impact of dilution factors used for quantitative culture or an insufficient homogenization of the samples. this method provides a mean to identify and quantify at the species level c. coli and c. jejuni directly from faecal, feed, and environmental samples without requiring an enrichment step. for the different field samples tested, the qualitative data  as well as the quantification results obtained by c. coli real-time pcr matched equally the results obtained by bacterial culture. in this study, no c. jejuni was identified among the faecal, feed, and environmental samples from the different pig herds by conventional pcr or by our c. jejuni real-time pcr assay. conversely, all the campylobacter tested were identified as c. coli by both methods. in france, pigs were found to be almost always contaminated by c. coli, these first results confirmed this predominance. nevertheless, given that we can find both species in pigs  <cit> , these real-time pcr assays allow a direct and rapid investigation of the carriage and the excretion of c. coli and c. jejuni in conventional pigs.

CONCLUSIONS
the real-time pcr assays for c. coli and c. jejuni described in this study have several advantages over culture-based techniques. these include allowing a large increase in throughput, enabling simultaneous processing of several samples , and reducing the total time required for analysis. the identification at the species level and the quantification on the entire dna extracted from faecal, feed, and environmental samples is a new tool to enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of campylobacter. in terms of risk assessment, this ability to differentiate and quantify these two species permits a more precise description of the carriage and excretion of c. coli and c. jejuni by livestock animals.
