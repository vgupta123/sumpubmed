BACKGROUND
the basal transcription apparatus in archaea shows similarity to the eukaryotic rna polymerase  ii system  <cit> . archaeal promoter sequences and the core proteins rna polymerase , tata-binding protein , and the transcription factor iib homologue  are structurally and functionally related to their eukaryotic counterparts  <cit> . although the basal transcriptional complex is composed of eukaryotic-like components, archaeal regulatory proteins are often homologous to bacterial regulators  <cit> . one group of bacterial regulators which have been found in all archaeal genomes belongs to the lrp/asnc family , asparagine synthase c ). escherichia coli lrp is the most extensively studied member in bacteria  <cit>  and controls the expression of up to  <dig> target genes. as a global regulator of transcription, lrp is believed to coordinate cellular metabolism in response to nutritional and environmental alterations  <cit> . most of these genes are involved in amino acid metabolism. lrp can bind to dna in its homodimeric form and either represses or activates transcription, modulated by the effector molecule l-leucine. negative autoregulation of lrp, however, occurs in a leucine independent way  <cit> .

genes encoding putative lrp/asnc-homologues have been studied in several archaea  <cit> , including methanocaldococcus jannaschii  <cit> , sulfolobus species  <cit>  and pyrococcus species  <cit> . as demonstrated for the sulfolobus solfataricus ss-lrp and lrs <dig>  those lrp/asnc-homologues were shown to bind to their own promoter regions, thereby repressing transcription  <cit> . besides controlling its own gene expression, sulfolobus solfataricus ss-lrpb positively regulates the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase  encoding operon and two permease genes  <cit> . another lrp-like protein, lysm from s. solfataricus, regulates the expression of the lyswxjk operon encoding lysine biosynthetic enzymes. in fact, in vitro binding of lysm to the lysw promoter takes place only if lysine is absent  <cit> . footprint analysis of the sa-lrp gene from sulfolobus acidocaldarius revealed multiple binding sites in the promoter region  <cit> , a pattern that had been described earlier for bacterial lrp proteins  <cit> . leucine has been suggested as a possible cofactor for sa-lrp under certain physiological conditions  <cit> .

in m. jannaschii, not only do the lrp-like proteins ptrl and ptr <dig> regulate their own transcription, but ptr <dig> can activate transcription of the ferredoxin  and the rubredoxin  genes by facilitating recruitment of tbp to their promoters  <cit> . in a pyrococcus furiosus cell-free transcription system, lrpa exerts negative autoregulation of its own transcription  <cit>  by interfering with the recruitment of rna polymerase  <cit> . crystal structures determined for several bacterial and archaeal lrp-like proteins . a flexible hinge connects this domain with the c-terminal oligomerization and effector binding domain  <cit> . the latter forms a so-called ram-domain   <cit> , designed to bind an effector molecule in the interface between the two dimers. a structure alignment of archaeal and bacterial lrp-homologues is shown in additional file  <dig> 

in halophilic archaea relatively little is known about lrp-like-regulators. the current study focuses on the lrp-like-regulators, lrpa <dig> and lrp in h. salinarum r <dig>  to identify lrp-targets, deletion mutants  as well as strains upregulated in these genes  were compared pairwise against the parental strain r <dig> by dna-microarrays. these results demonstrated that lrp exerts a global transcriptional control in this organism. on the other hand, lrpa <dig> was shown to possess a specific regulatory function targeting the aspartate transaminase gene . we demonstrated effector molecule dependent binding of lrpa <dig> to the aspb <dig> promoter by dna-affinity chromatography, as well as effector molecule dependent gene expression of aspb <dig> by northern analysis.

RESULTS
specific transcriptional control by lrpal in h. salinarum r1
of the eight lrp-homologues found h. salinarum, lrpa <dig> and lrp are located next to genes involved in amino acid metabolism , suggestive of a direct regulatory influence. to confirm this, and to identify other possible targets of lrpa <dig> we used dna-microarrays. two genetic approaches, either a deletion strain of lrpa <dig>  or an overexpressing strain , were compared pairwise against the h. salinarum r <dig> parental strain. target genes showing reciprocal regulatory changes between the deletion strain and the overexpression strain, reflect the regulatory effects of lrpa <dig> . the deletion and overexpressing strains grew as well as the parental strain in complex medium . the deletion mutant was verified by southern blot analysis . induction of lrpa <dig> transcription in the overexpressing strain was shown by microarray-analysis. level of lrpa <dig> expression was 24-fold higher in overexpression mutant than in wild type  and a complete list of significantly differentially expressed genes is presented in 

as expected, transcription of aspb <dig>  the gene adjacent to lrpa <dig>  was affected by the absence or overexpression of lrpa <dig>  in the ↑lrpa <dig> background , aspb <dig> showed slight repression, while deletion of lrpa <dig> led to strong induction. another lrpa <dig> target gene identified by the microarray analysis was tfbb, the basal transcriptional regulator gene. this gene was repressed by lrpa1-overexpression. additionally, strong repression was found for oe6130f, the gene encoding a hypothetical protein of unknown function. oe6130f is located on the plasmid phs <dig>  its adjacent genes are oe6128r encoding a conserved hypothetical protein and oe6133r encoding a transposase.

in the Δlrpa <dig> mutant, induction of aspb <dig> and oe6130f was confirmed by rt-qpcr, which showed reductions in transcript levels of 19- and 28-fold, respectively 

organisation of lrpa <dig> and aspb <dig> operons of h. salinarum rl
since the dna-microarray analysis showed that aspb <dig> is the most prominent target for lrpa <dig>  we performed further investigations on the regulation of aspb <dig> by lrpa <dig>  lrpa <dig> and aspb <dig> are orientated in opposite directions and have separate promoters. in other halophilic organisms, like natronomonas pharaonis, haloquadratum walsbyi and haloarcula marismortui, these genes are orientated in the same direction and share one common promoter .

the transcription start sites and 3'ends of lrpa <dig> and aspb <dig>  were located using 5'3'-race, based on the circularisation of rna. lrpa <dig> was found to be transcribed as a leaderless mrna, starting at the first g of the start codon, gtg . the putative tata-box of lrpa <dig> is located - <dig> bp upstream of the transcriptional start site . possible regulator protein binding sites were found at positions - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  in m. jannaschii at rich inverted repeat sequences have been demonstrated to be dna-binding motifs for lrp-like transcriptional regulators  <cit> . another cis-element in the lrpa <dig> promoter is two adenines at position -11/- <dig>  consistent with the basal promoter motif previously described  <cit> . as a consequence of the overlap of these genes, the lrpa <dig> 3' untranslated region  shows complementarity to the orf of aspb <dig> over  <dig> bp , a consequence of the overlap of these genes. no uridine rich terminator sequence was identified for the lrpa <dig> transcript .

in contrast to lrpa <dig>  the aspb <dig> transcript has a 5'utr leader sequence of  <dig> bp, without a shine-dalgarno sequence upstream of the aug start codon . inspection upstream of the aspb <dig> transcription start site revealed, that the aspb <dig> promoter does not contain a consensus tata-box at the expected position . the 3'utr of aspb <dig> included a  <dig> bp terminal sequence that is complementary to the 3'end of lrpa <dig>  no characteristic termination signal was detected in this region .

lrpal binds to the aspb <dig> and to its own promoter
several bacterial and archaeal lrp-homologues are known to bind to their own promoter as well as to the promoters of target genes  <cit> . the binding of lrpa <dig> to its own promoter and to the aspb <dig> promoter region was examined using analytical dna-affinity chromatography, adapted to halophilic conditions. because the exact binding sites for lrpa <dig> in the promoter regions of lrpa <dig> and aspb <dig> were unknown, the complete non-coding region upstream of these two genes was amplified. these pcr products were designated as lrpa1pincl and aspb3pincl;  with a length of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. an additional pcr product was generated where the inverted repeat sequence in the lrpa <dig> promoter region was mutated . there was no corresponding inverted repeat sequence in the aspb <dig> promoter . as a non-specific binding control in the assay, we used the flagellin gene flgb <dig>  the dna fragments lrpa1pincl, aspb3pincl and the control fragment flgb <dig> were amplified using a biotin labelled primer and subsequently coupled to a streptavidin sepharose matrix. heterologously expressed lrpa <dig>  tested for correct folding by cd-spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography , was then incubated with dna fragments and eluted protein fractions analyzed on sds-page .

as shown in fig. 4a, lrpa <dig> binds to the lrpa1pincl fragment. mutation of the inverted repeat in this sequence  prevented binding of lrpa <dig> . in conjunction with the current knowledge about other lrp-homologues, these results suggest lrpa <dig> is subject to negative autoregulation  <cit> . a weaker binding of lrpa <dig> to the aspb3pincl fragment was also demonstrated . lrp-homologues often control gene expression together with a ligand molecule. therefore we tested aspartate as a possible effector molecule of the aspb <dig> gene expression.  <dig> mm aspartate was added to the binding experiment, resulting in significantly enhanced binding of lrpa <dig> to the aspb3pincl sequence . if  <dig> mm arginine was used instead of aspartate, the binding efficiency of lrpa <dig> to the aspb3pincl fragment was not enhanced , indicating that the interaction shows specificity for aspartate. table  <dig> shows the relative binding efficiencies of lrpa <dig> to sepharose-bound dna fragments calculated from  <dig> independent binding experiments. both lanes, the monomer and the dimer, were included in our calculations of band densities. according to the estimated molecular weight, the upper band represents protein dimers. the presence of lrpa <dig> dimers after treatment with heat and sds indicates that they are stable to these denaturing conditions. thus, lrpa1-dna binding studies showed that lrpa <dig> binds to its own promoter, as well as to the aspb <dig> promoter enhanced by aspartate .

a average and standard deviation values are based on three separate experiments

lrpa <dig> regulates transcription of aspb <dig> in an aspartate dependent manner
h. salinarum possesses three different aspartate transaminases, aspb <dig>  aspb <dig> and aspb <dig> . all belong to subgroup ib of the aspartate transaminases  <cit> , and share  <dig>   <dig> and 32% sequence identity, respectively, with the thermus thermophilus enzyme  <cit> . aspartate transaminases catalyze the reversible conversion of aspartate and oxoglutarate to oxaloacetate and glutamate.

since lrpa <dig> appears to regulate the expression of aspb <dig>  we first investigated the transcription of lrpa <dig> during different growth phases using northern blot hybridization and a specific probe against lrpa <dig>  . in the wild type strain, lrpa <dig> transcripts remained constant at cell densities of  <dig>  to  <dig>  . although the lrpa <dig> transcript could be detected during stationary phase, its amount decreased . these results show that lrpa <dig> transcripts accumulate during exponential growth. therefore, to test the regulation of aspb <dig> by lrpa <dig> in an aspartate and glutamate dependent manner, wild type and the Δlrpa <dig> cells were cultivated up to cell densities in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>   either in a complex medium or in a synthetic medium, in the presence or absence of aspartate or glutamate. rna was extracted and analyzed on northern blots using an aspb <dig> specific probe . this hybridized to a corresponding transcript with the expected size of aspb <dig> . in complex medium, aspb <dig> was slightly induced at the beginning of the exponential growth phase . in contrast, in synthetic medium supplemented with aspartate and glutamate, aspb <dig> was induced in the early stationary phase  . while in synthetic medium with aspartate a slight induction of aspb <dig> was observed in the early stationary phase . in synthetic medium with glutamate, aspb <dig> was already abundant in the early exponential growth phase  . when both amino acids  were omitted, aspb <dig> showed high induction at a cell density of  <dig>  and slight induction at  <dig>  .

in synthetic medium, h. salinarum showed similar growth behaviour whether or not aspartate was present . these results show that aspb <dig> transcription is repressed in the presence of aspartate. if there is no aspartate in the synthetic medium , or it has been metabolized in the early stationary phase, repression is released, and synthesis of aspartate from glutamate ensues.

at cell densities of ≥  <dig> cells/ml  h. salinarum r <dig> has been reported to rapidly metabolize aspartate  <cit> . previously reported growth studies of h. salinarum r <dig> have shown that when media have both aspartate and glutamate present, the former amino acid is metabolized rapidly while the levels of the latter remains constant  <cit> . to test the regulatory effect of lrpa <dig> on the aspb <dig> gene transcription, mrna levels of aspb <dig> were analyzed in Δlrpa <dig> cells grown with or without aspartate or glutamate . we observed an increased and constitutive transcription, independent of the added amino acids. this demonstrates unambiguously the involvement of lrpa <dig> in the regulation of the aspb <dig> gene expression.

multiple transcriptional control by lrp in h. salinarum
residues in the sequence of lrpa <dig> and lrp predicted to be involved in ligand specificity of the binding pocket are different in both regulators  and therefore a different control of targets was expected. lrp is located next to the glutamine synthetase gene glna, without a sequence overlap. the mapped transcription site is at the a of the start codon atg . target genes for lrp were identified using the same approach as described for lrpa <dig> . target genes showing reciprocal regulatory changes between the deletion strain  and the overexpression strain , suggesting the direct regulatory effects of lrp . induction of lrp transcription in overexpressing strains was shown by microarray-analysis. in the overexpression mutant, levels of lrp is 46-fold higher than in wild type . the successful overexpression of lrp was proven by western blot analysis using a specific antibody against lrp . a complete list of significantly differentially expressed genes is presented in additional file  <dig> 

besides genes of the amino acid metabolism, the targets affected by lrp were genes of central intermediary metabolism, . for example, glna, the gene next to lrp, was induced in the lrp-overexpression strain. the glycerol dehydrogenase gene, glda <dig> was repressed by lrp, whereas korab, encoding the oxoglutarate oxidoreductase complex, which is part of the tca-cycle was induced. additionally the car gene, encoding a transducer protein involved in signal transduction processes was repressed in the presence of lrp-overexpression. genes involved in transcriptional regulation were also affected by lrp. the transcriptional regulator sirr, a homologue of the staphylococcal iron regulator repressor and the basal transcription factor gene tfbf, were found to be induced by lrp-overexpression   <cit> . lrp-overexpression produced induction of transporter genes, like pstc <dig> and phnc, which belong to phosphate transport operons .

discussion
lrp-homologues have been described for several bacterial and archaeal organisms, but not yet for halophilic archaea. here we investigated the function of a halophilic lrp-homologue, lrpa <dig>  additional file  <dig> shows an alignment of lrpa <dig> with other archaeal and bacterial lrp-homologues. high sequence similarity was observed with lrpa  from p. furiosus. the low sequence identity in the ligand binding pocket, named ram-domain  between lrpa <dig> and lrp suggests different regulatory mechanisms . the h. salinarum lrpa <dig> binding pocket belongs to a subgroup of the lrp-like proteins, which includes some that might be effector-independent  <cit>  and some for which the effector regulation is unknown . the lrp ligand binding site shows high amino acid conservation with s. solfataricus lysm which probably binds lysine  <cit>  . we therefore expect the h. salinarum lrp to be a ligand dependent regulator, which is a subject of future investigation.

lrpa <dig> was shown to be regulated by aspartate and since this protein is a specific regulator of two different promoter sequences, lrpa <dig> and aspb <dig>  we hypothesize that the lrpa <dig> and aspb <dig> gene expression is reciprocally regulated . for lrpa <dig>  we suggest an inverted repeat in the lrpa <dig> promoter as a putative protein binding site, whereas the aspb <dig> promoter lacks such a sequence. at first glance, it seems surprising that lrpa <dig> binds to two different promoter structures, but as shown for e. coli lrp, promoter target sites may share only weak sequence conservation  <cit> . in the exponential phase lrpa <dig> expression is maximal. since l-aspartate is present in the medium the binding of lrpa <dig> to the aspb <dig> promoter is enhanced. once aspartate is metabolized, small conformational changes in lrpa <dig> might occur that allow it to bind to the lrpa <dig> promoter . as the repression of the aspb <dig> gene is abrogated, transcription of aspartate transaminase will be initiated in order to synthesize aspartate from glutamate . this model of lrpa <dig> regulation could explain a direct influence of lrpa <dig> in regulating its neighbour gene aspb <dig>  the dna-microarray data indicate that lrpa <dig> regulates the expression of aspb <dig> 

in contrast to lrpa <dig>  another lrp-homologue named lrp affects the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved not only in amino acid but also in central metabolism. for many organisms, lrp acts as both an activator and a repressor of transcription. like e. coli lrp, the lrp of h. salinarum r <dig> affects the regulation of amino acid metabolism and genes encoding peptide transporter dpp . lrp binding sites in h. salinarum nrc- <dig>  a strain that shows a  <dig> % sequence identity to h. salinarum r <dig>  <cit> , have been previously reported  <cit> . in nrc- <dig> lrp-homologues are designated as trh and nine of them are annotated in the genome of h. salinarum nrc- <dig>  h. salinarum r <dig> lrpa <dig>  and lrp  are 100% identical with the h. salinarum nrc- <dig> trh <dig> and trh <dig>  respectively, the latter one was previously analyzed  <cit> . comparison of our data with the published nrc- <dig> data revealed that, out of all the affected genes, only three were showing the same trends in both: the glutamine synthetase gene, glna, which is located adjacent to lrp; the glycerol dehydrogenase gene, glda <dig> and the transducer gene, car . glda <dig> was repressed by lrp in h. salinarum r <dig>  the metabolism of glycerol is complex. it can either be converted to dihydroxyacetone  by glycerol dehydrogenase glda <dig>  <cit> , or phosphorylated by glycerol kinase to glycerol-3-phosphate. the latter can be fed into glycolysis as dihydroxyacetone phosphate , or is converted to glycerol-1-phosphate which is used as a substrate for the production of archaeal phospholipids. however, the fate of dha remains unclear because the corresponding kinase for the subsequent conversion of dha to dhap is not yet known  <cit> . the repression of glda <dig> might favour glycerol phosphorylation by reducing the flow of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone . besides the three affected genes that were common between nrc- <dig> and r <dig>  there were distinct targets of lrp in strain r <dig>  for example, activation of korab, encoding the oxoglutarate oxidoreductase complex, a tca cycle enzyme . korab belongs to the family of two oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases  and catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of oxoglutarate and is part of the following conversion together with coa to succinyl-coa. for s. solfataricus ss-lrpb, activation of the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductases por-operon has been reported by peeters;  <dig>  <cit> . the or-enzymes act on various substrates that play key roles in amino acid metabolism  <cit> .

in h. salinarum r <dig>  korab induction by lrp suggests that korab catalyzes the rate-determining step of the tca-cycle. this might influence the oxoglutarate/glutamate balance and shift carbon flow towards glutamate synthesis or degradation. in the lrp-overexpression strain, a slight induction was observed for the glutamate dehydrogenase gene, gdha <dig>  glutamate is incorporated into the tca-cycle by gdha <dig> and metabolized by korab to generate further metabolites or provide reducing equivalents. as already mentioned, lrp regulates the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate by induction of glna. in h. salinarum, glutamate is accumulated as a carbon storage compound and as a compatible osmolyte, and reaches concentrations of 50- <dig> mm  <cit> . if needed, glutamate can be converted into other metabolites, e.g. amino acids.

both regulators, lrpa <dig> and lrp, influence the expression of tfb's. it has been proposed earlier that different combinations of tfbs and tbps may act in an analogous way to bacterial sigma factors in order to control global gene expression in h. salinarum nrc- <dig>  <cit> . lrp activates tfbf, whereas lrpa <dig> represses tfbb. in strain nrc- <dig>  tfbf is thought to control either directly or indirectly the transcription of target genes  <cit> .

the transcriptional regulator sirr, a homologue of the staphylococcal iron regulator repressor, was found to be induced by lrp   <cit> . sirr is described as a repressor of a putative mn-dependent abc-transporter in h. salinarum nrc- <dig>  <cit> . in r <dig>  induction of the putative mn-dependent abc-transport operon  in a Δsirr deletion strain was shown . in the current study slight repression of the abc-transporter gene, oe5147r was detected in the lrp-overexpression strain, where sirr is induced. this is consistent with sirr acting as a repressor of the abc-transport operon. the data also showed induction of pstc <dig> and phnc, which belong to phosphate and phosphonate transport operons . in nrc- <dig>  sirr is thought to take part in the regulation of phosphate transport processes  <cit> . lrp might then indirectly influence phosphate metabolism by controlling sirr expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these studies on lrp-like homologues in the halophilic branch of archaea have clearly demonstrated that they share a similar general function to their homologues in bacteria, i.e. they are transcriptional regulators that may have narrow or global regulatory actions. lrp activates the gene expression of the glutamine synthetase gene glna, influences peptide- and phosphate transport, as well as the central intermediary metabolism, and activates the expression of the transcriptional regulator sirr. by the control of sirr gene expression through lrp correlation between amino acid metabolism and metal dependent processes could be demonstrated. in contrast to lrp, lrpa <dig> regulates gene expression of fewer genes, amongst them the aspartate transaminase gene aspb <dig>  lrpa <dig> was shown to bind to the lrpa <dig> promoter region, as well as an aspartate dependent binding to the aspb <dig> promoter region. to gain more insights into the lrpa <dig> and l-aspartate dependent aspb <dig> gene expression, northern blot analysis were performed, that showed an induction of the aspb <dig> transcription in the absence of l- aspartate. this occurs either in a medium lacking aspartate or after aspartate is metabolized in the stationary phase. at the same time, an induction of the lrpa <dig> gene expression was observed. this can be illustrated in a model that postulates a reciprocal regulation of the lrpa <dig> and aspb <dig> gene expression. much remains to be understood, but the current work provides a solid foundation for further investigations of the haloarchaeal lrp protein family and their regulatory networks.
