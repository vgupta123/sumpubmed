BACKGROUND
lung development starts in mice at embryonic day  <dig>  . by e <dig> , airways have extensively grown and branched to form the bronchial tree. between e <dig>  and term  lung cell proliferation is gradually reduced, and the distal lung undergoes significant morphogenetic changes to form the alveolar sacs. while a population of distal epithelial cells flattens, thins, and spreads to form type i cells, other distal epithelial cells remain cuboidal, acquire surfactant filled lamellar bodies and differentiate into type ii cells. differentiation of epithelial cells is accompanied by vascular remodeling and thinning of the mesenchyme, and results in enlargement of the diameter and surface area of the alveolar sacs. overall this process is known as sacculation, and it is critical to increase the efficiency of fluid absorption and gas exchange processes at birth  <cit> .

very little is known about the molecular regulation of sacculation in normal animals. abnormal sacculation has been reported in many genetically altered animals carrying null mutations, or transgenes that mis- or over-express growth factors, transcription factors, and other regulatory molecules. these molecular abnormalities result in formation of alveolar spaces that are either too small, as in glucocorticoid receptor   <cit> , corticotropin releasing hormone   <cit> , and sp <dig> knockout mice  <cit> , and double p21p <dig> and p21p <dig> mice  <cit> , or too large as in gp <dig> knockout mouse  <cit> , the sp-c promoter-bmp <dig> mouse  <cit> , and sp-c promoter-gata <dig> mouse  <cit> . it is interesting that both extremes of alveolar sac size can result in death of the newborn shortly after birth due to respiratory failure. collectively these observations suggest that formation of alveolar sacs of appropriate dimensions, surface area, and thickness is of fundamental importance in lung organogenesis and is critical for survival.

we have previously shown that mice carrying a null mutation of the t1α gene fail to form expanded alveolar sacs near term and die at birth due to an inability to inflate their lungs with the first few breaths  <cit> . in normal late fetal and adult lungs, t1α protein is uniquely expressed in the apical membrane of type i alveolar epithelial cells, which form over 90% of the alveolar surface that is specialized for gas exchange  <cit> . in the absence of this protein the alveolar sacs still form but they are narrower than normal and do not properly expand at birth. this abnormality appears to be linked to deficient differentiation of type i cells. this was indicated by the presence of fewer attenuated type i cells and reduced expression of aqp- <dig>  another type i cell marker gene. secreted surfactant and surfactant gene expression patterns indicate normal differentiation of type ii cells in t1α  lungs.

some insights into the process of alveolar sacculation in normal animals come from gene expression microarray data using lungs of normal mice at different developmental time points from embryonic day  <dig> through postnatal week  <dig>  <cit> . this study shows marked changes in gene expression between fetal day  <dig> and newborn, a period that encompasses the process of sacculation. among the genes altered are the transcription factors pod <dig> and gata <dig>  the stress-related gene cyr <dig>  surfactant protein d, and caveolin-1α. however, this important survey was not designed specifically to study sacculation, which would require sampling at more frequent time points near term.

as an alternative approach for understanding the molecular regulation of sacculation, it is reasonable to compare lungs with normal alveolar sac formation to those with altered sac formation and infer from differences in gene expression a set of candidate genes involved in the process. preliminary expression microarray analysis of the gr knockout lung  <cit>  has explored the overall changes in gene expression that lead to alterations in alveolar sac formation. this approach has also been used to study the related process of alveologenesis, that involves formation of septae that 'subdivide' alveolar sacs into smaller units or true alveoli  <cit> .

here, we use a microarray approach to begin to understand the molecular mechanisms by which formation of alveolar sacs is altered in t1α null mice, animals that serve as a highly reproducible model of altered lung sacculation. we have identified genes that are preferentially altered in the t1α null lung prior to recognizable structural abnormalities, such as ephrina <dig>  and identified that a number of regulators of the cell cycle are altered at term. our study also shows that p <dig>  a negative cell cycle regulator, is decreased at term but not at e <dig>  at both the mrna and protein levels, a finding that is likely associated with the failure of sacculation. these genes are now candidates for future studies designed to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate sacculation in the normal lung.

RESULTS
altered alveolar sac morphology in the absence of t1α is evident on fetal day e <dig> 
t1α protein is expressed in the apical surface of lung epithelial cells throughout mouse development . to determine the timing of the initial phenotypic alterations in the absence of t1α, we analyzed the distal lung morphology of t1α and t1α lungs at e <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . histological analyses showed no differences between t1α and t1α lungs at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . gross morphology of the lobes and size of the epithelial buds are similar in  and  lungs at e <dig> . no significant difference in epithelial tube number and size is apparent at e <dig>  , suggesting that branching morphogenesis is not altered in t1α lungs. in normal lung development, thinning of the mesenchyme, epithelial type i cell flattening, and enlargement of the air spaces are observed between e <dig>  and term, as the alveolar sacs form. in the absence of t1α, the abnormal phenotype is evident at e <dig>  and becomes progressively more severe at e <dig>   and at term  <cit> , as the alveolar sacs are very narrow and irregular and the mesenchyme appears thicker than normal .

altered expression of pcna and p <dig> genes
to determine whether morphological alterations observed in the absence of t1α at e <dig>  are also accompanied by changes in cell proliferation, we compared expression of pcna and p <dig> genes by northern and western blot analyses in ,  and  lungs at e <dig>  and term. neither pcna nor p <dig> protein level is altered at e <dig>  in t1α lungs compared to t1α . however at term, p <dig> mrna is reduced  <dig> -fold in  lungs   and p <dig> protein is reduced to 75% of the level in  lungs  . we have previously shown high numbers of pcna-stained cells at term, and that pcna protein is significantly up-regulated ~ <dig>  fold in  lungs  <cit> . this trend is also observed in fig. 3a . the mrna levels of other two members of the cdk inhibitor family, p <dig> and p <dig> at term are not altered . these data suggest that the increase in distal lung cell proliferation in the absence of t1α occurs after morphological alterations are evident, and is probably the consequence of earlier changes in gene expression triggered by the absence of t1α. in the microarray analysis neither p <dig> nor p <dig> are detected as present  precluding the comparison to the northern blot analysis. pcna and p <dig> are both detected as present in the microarrays  and their levels of expression do not change in the absence of t1α  compared to  at e <dig>  or at term , similarly to the data obtained by northern blots .

changes in gene expression in t1α null mutant lungs
to identify genes potentially involved in the abnormal alveolar sac formation of the t1α null lungs we analyzed global gene expression profiles of t1α vs. t1α lungs, at e <dig>  and at term, using oligonucleotide microarrays. the data were analyzed using student's t-test and the more stringent mann-whitney analysis  <cit> . we identified  <dig> genes that differ between  and  lungs at e <dig> , with student's t-test p ≤  <dig> , and median detection p value ≤  <dig>  at least in one genotype . of those,  <dig> genes have a mann-whitney p value ≤  <dig>  . genes in this group that are up  or down  regulated more than  <dig>  fold with a student's t-test p ≤  <dig>  and mann-whitney p ≤  <dig>  are shown in table  <dig>  at term, there are  <dig> genes that change significantly with a student's t-test p ≤  <dig>  , mann-whitney p =  <dig>  . the ability to detect genes that change significantly between t1α  and  at term was limited by the smaller sample size at that time point . known genes in this group changing more than  <dig>  fold are shown in table  <dig>  the microarray quality control parameters analyzed, described in the methods section, indicate that all hybridization experiments are comparable and of good quality.

we used ease bioinformatic tool to identify over-represented biological processes, defined by the gene ontology database , for  <dig> genes that have altered expression at e <dig>  and for the  <dig> genes altered at term in the absence of t1α . genes involved in vasculogenesis, protein targeting, protein metabolism and mitosis are over-represented at e <dig>  with an ease score ≤  <dig> . apoptosis, cell proliferation and regulation of transcription are over-represented at term with an ease score ≤  <dig> . this analysis reflects the molecular events that occur in fetal and term lung in the absence of t1α during alveolar sac formation, and supports the finding that altered proliferation is a late gestation event that may be the result of earlier changes in gene expression in the absence of t1α. these data also correlate with the increased pcna and reduced p <dig> protein expression observed at term. changes in gene expression between t1α and t1α lungs either at e <dig>  or at term are significant  but moderate, considering the major morphological changes observed in the absence of t1α. we previously showed that the absence of t1α alters differentiation of type i epithelial cells but does not appear to affect other cell types of the distal lung at term, such as type ii cells or endothelial cells  <cit> . also, a similar proportion of epithelial to mesenchymal cells in t1α and  lungs is suggested by unchanged levels of expression of the epithelial markers cytokeratin  <dig> and  <dig> and the mesenchymal marker collagen 1α <dig> at e <dig>  and term . thus, molecular changes in an epithelial cell population that accounts for ~10% of the cells of the lung are likely to provide minimal signals when analyzed in the context of total lung mrnas or proteins. these small but statistically significant changes are likely to be biologically relevant. likewise, the molecular alterations in the absence of t1α could be at the post-transcriptional level.

we evaluated by real time rt-pcr  changes in expression of selected genes identified by the microarray analyses . we confirmed the trend in expression observed in the microarrays for several genes, making them good candidates for further studies. many of the genes have been previously described in the lung , and are therefore potentially involved in the formation of functional alveolar sacs.

at e <dig>  we identified genes that are involved in cell-cell interaction, cell motility, prostaglandin metabolism, and signal transduction . one of the genes involved in cell-cell interaction and cell motility is ephrina <dig>  which is up regulated at the mrna and protein level . another member of the ephrin family, ephrin b <dig>  is down regulated . cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein involved in microtubule-mediated forward cell migration  <cit> , is up regulated in the absence of t1α . genes involved in cell adhesion are also altered, such as the extracellular matrix protein βig-h <dig>  and vcam <dig> . ptgs <dig>  mrna and protein expression levels are reduced in the absence of t1α . overall these changes in gene expression suggest that a different reorganization of the cellular structure is taking place in  lungs compared to wild type at e <dig> .

at term, expression of several genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation is altered . among these, the early response genes fosb, egr <dig>  mpk- <dig> and nur <dig> are down regulated .

some genes tested by qrt-pcr showed a variable level of expression in different t1α lungs, such as sp <dig> and rb . this is likely due to differences in the penetrance of the phenotype  <cit>  within independent samples isolated in different experiments. the down-regulation of the expression of cyr <dig> mrna observed in the microarray analysis was not validated by other methods and cyr <dig> protein level is significantly up-regulated in the absence of t1α . this finding underscores the fact that changes in mrna levels do not always correlate with changes in protein expression.

discussion
we have used the t1α knock-out mouse lung as a model of failed alveolar sacculation to begin to discover what genes are involved in the regulation of this critical morphogenetic event before birth. we previously reported that at term, lungs of the t1α knockout mouse display a severe phenotype  <cit> , with airspaces that are small and often tortuous. the small airspaces cannot be expanded under positive pressure, indicating that the peripheral lung surface area is underdeveloped. despite this dramatic phenotype, the null lungs at term have many normal features, including a normal number of type ii alveolar epithelial cells, normal expression levels of surfactant protein mrnas , of a bronchiolar cell marker , and of selected growth factors including fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  <cit> . of the genes tested, only aquaporin  <dig>  another type i cell membrane protein, is reduced at both the mrna and protein level. pcna protein, a marker of post-proliferative cells, is increased at birth as was expected given the hyperproliferative phenotype of the term animals.

several other genetically altered animals have shown a failure of sacculation resulting in lung histology that resembles the t1α deficient mice. the genes targeted in these animals therefore become candidates for key players in the process of sacculation. these include the transcription factors sp <dig>  <cit>  and nf1b  <cit> , hormones and hormone receptors crh  <cit>  and gr  <cit> , and inhibitors of the cell cycle p21/p <dig> p <dig> mice)  <cit> . mice deficient in these genes show failed sacculation at term, respiratory distress at birth, and usually neonatal death, while maintaining many normal features of the peripheral lung. the targeted genes that result in dysmorphic sacculation encode proteins of different functional categories, such as transcription factors or membrane receptors. it is noteworthy that null mutations of two important alveolar epithelial proteins, t1α and gp330/megalin  <cit> , expressed in the apical membranes of type i and type ii cells respectively, disrupt sacculation. t1α loss inhibits formation of expanded saccules, while loss of gp330/megalin results in abnormally enlarged saccules with cystic or emphysematous-like features  <cit> .

while the identity of the genes knocked-out in the above animals is obviously known, none of these models of altered sacculation has been explored in detail to define the molecular pathways that lead to their phenotype. t1α, sp <dig>  gr, crh, and megalin, for example, are all expressed early in lung embryogenesis and in the lung thereafter  <cit> . in those knock-outs there is considerable uncertainty about the timing of molecular events that, in the end, affect sacculation. one could envision that the accumulation of small molecular anomalies over time might block a major morphogenetic event. to address this question, we show here that the global gene expression patterns of t1α null lungs at gestational day  <dig>  and term differ both from controls and from each other.

comparison of microarray analyses of t1α-null and wild-type lungs on day  <dig>  shows changes in expression of genes in several functional categories including transcription factors, cell-cell interaction, enzymes, channels, and others, that are reflected in overrepresentation of several biological processes including vasculogenesis, protein targeting, protein, metabolism, and mitosis. among the cell-cell interaction genes ephrina <dig> is significantly up-regulated in lungs showing narrow alveolar saccules. ephrins are surface bound proteins that interact with eph tyrosine kinase receptors at sites of cell-cell interactions. the bidirectional signaling generated by this interaction regulates intercellular adhesion, cell shape and cell motility  <cit> . ephrins, semaphorins, netrins and slit protein families generate molecular cues to guide cell movement and tissue morphogenesis .

semaphorins, netrins and slit proteins appear to participate in early lung branching morphogenesis. in contrast there is sparse information about the role of ephrins in the lung. several ephrinas and epha receptors are expressed in adult lung suggesting that they can also participate in cell-cell interaction in this organ. in particular ephrina <dig> is highly up-regulated in squamous lung cell carcinomas  <cit> . the role of ephrinas has been mostly studied in neurons and vascular formation  <cit>  but it is possible that increased ephrina <dig> in t1α lungs alters the motility and/or shape of distal lung cells resulting in abnormal alveolar sac morphogenesis, a possibility that will require further evaluation.

several types of enzymes such as peptidases, ligases, and others are affected at e <dig> . one enzyme of particular interest is ptgs  <dig>  that is decreased in t1α knockout lungs. ptgs <dig> catalyzes the production of pge <dig> that is the major prostaglandin species produced in the lung. pge <dig> is known to be a negative regulator of lung fibroblast proliferation in adult rodents. while many lung cells can produce pge <dig>  murine alveolar epithelial cells are immunoreactive for cox- <dig> protein and adult alveolar type ii epithelial cells have been directly shown to produce pge <dig>  although the pattern of expression of ptgs <dig> in mouse fetal lung is not known  <cit> , decreased epithelial-derived prostaglandins due to a near absence of flattened type i cells, might affect mesenchymal cells in term t1α lungs  <cit> .

biochemical data at term show that pcna levels are higher and p <dig> levels are lower than normal in t1α lungs. microarray analyses of term t1α lungs identify additional genes likely involved in the hyperproliferation phenotype of the term peripheral lung, such as fosb, egr <dig>  mkp- <dig> and nur <dig>  these immediate early genes are significantly down regulated. changes in the expression of these genes were not observed at day  <dig> . fosb belongs to the ap- <dig> family of proteins regulated after mitogenic stimulation. c-jun/fosb dimers inhibit cell proliferation through binding to the rb promoter  <cit> . egr <dig> is a transcription factor responsive to a variety of stress and mitogenic signals that inhibits proliferation by activation of p <dig>  <cit> .  reduced expression of egr <dig> in t1α  lungs may be involved in the down regulation of p <dig> transcription observed at term. the transcription factor nur <dig>  is an orphan nuclear receptor that modulates the retinoic acid signaling  <cit> . mkp- <dig> is a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatases that inhibits g <dig> progression in response to growth factors. decreases in mkp- <dig> have been associated with increased proliferation  <cit> . mkp- <dig> transcription is up regulated by glucocorticoids through the gr receptor  <cit> . the similar phenotype of gr null lungs and t1α null lungs suggests that mkp- <dig> could be a common gene altered in these two mutant mice that regulates distal lung differentiation. although all these changes point to possible abnormalities in cell cycle regulation, exactly how this might work and what the relationship between excess cell division and failure of sacculation is, remain unclear. based on studies of other cells, decreased p <dig> would be expected to result in increased cell proliferation in the affected cell population. however because the net effects on cell cycle regulation are likely complex and dependent on the context of the affected cells it will be important in future studies to determine which lung cell types show alterations in proliferation related genes. it is possible that proliferation is repressed in some cell types while others are hyperproliferative, and are pcna positive. an important site of decreased p <dig> expression is likely the type ii cell which, in the t1α knock-out mouse, continues to express pcna inappropriately near term. although the sites of p <dig> expression are not well mapped in the fetal mouse lung, p <dig> and pro-sp-b proteins colocalize in newborn baboon lung under some conditions  <cit> , and p <dig> mrna is expressed in peripheral lung of fetal mice as shown by in situ hybridization  <cit> . if nascent type i cells are derived from post-mitotic type ii cells, withdrawal from the cell cycle may be required before type i characteristics, including the distinctive morphology, can be expressed. this alone might affect sacculation. this possibility is consistent with the failed sacculation, neonatal respiratory death, and normal levels of surfactant proteins and ccsp in the double p21p <dig> knockout mouse  <cit> .

we have hypothesized that changes in gene expression might be few and of small magnitude based on previous northern analyses of null lungs at term  <cit> . given the striking phenotype of the term lung, the relatively small change in many of the affected genes identified by microarray analysis, often between  <dig>  and  <dig> fold, is notable. many of these changes are highly significant, however, and are included in our assembled data because of the low variance between samples. although a >twofold difference has been conventional in considering genes as functionally important, a number of previous studies have also opted to use lower cut-off levels   <cit>  when the changes are highly significant. in the t1α null lung this issue may relate in part to the fact that the type i cell comprises only about 10% of total lung cells; thus even large fold changes in genes expressed by type i cell precursors could be masked by lack of change of the same gene in other cell populations. in this regard it would have been useful to determine the fold changes in aqp- <dig> mrna by microarray because it is expressed only in type i cells in the peripheral lung; however aqp- <dig> mrna is not represented on the arrays we used.

CONCLUSIONS
this global analysis of gene expression has identified a number of candidate genes that are significantly altered in lungs in which sacculation is diminished and has linked abnormal sacculation to alterations in the expression of cell cycle regulators. some of these genes may be involved in the regulation of sacculation per se while others may be expressed as a consequence of failed sacculation. our future studies will be directed towards further characterization of expression patterns genes identified, such as ephrina <dig>  ptgs <dig> and the cell cycle regulators, as preliminary to test their functions in the sacculation process.
