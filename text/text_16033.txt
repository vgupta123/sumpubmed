BACKGROUND
proto-oncogenes normally help regulate cell growth and differentiation under well-controlled conditions, including mitogenic signal transductions in cells  <cit> . uncontrolled expression of proto-oncogenes due to mutations or activation of signaling can give rise to a tumor-inducing agent, which is known as an oncogene  <cit> . for more than a decade, there has been a focus on the transcriptional regulation of oncogenes or proto-oncogenes in search of therapeutic clues against cancers which are induced by over-transcription of their oncogenes.

wnt is known as a proto-oncogene and its signaling pathway is a complex network of proteins with roles in embryogenesis  <cit>  and cancer  <cit> . wnt and its signaling pathway is also involved in normal physiologic processes, including cell polarity  <cit> , axon guidance  <cit> , and stem cell growth factor  <cit> . two wnt pathways have been identified, the canonical and non-canonical pathways. more than 90% of colorectal cancers and other digestive cancers are associated with defects in the canonical wnt signaling pathway by mutations in apc  <cit> , axin <dig>  <cit> , or ctnnb <dig>  <cit> . these mutations make it impossible to assist gsk-3β in phosphorylation and in rapid degradation of β-catenin through the ubiquitin pathway as a result of accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and formation of a complex with tcf in the nucleus, which initiates transcription of the wnt target genes  <cit> .

the human cervical cancer oncogene  <dig>  has been identified as a novel oncogene with strong tumorigenic features in nude mice  <cit> . hccr- <dig> is post-translationally localized in the mitochondria, sub-compartmentally in its outer membrane  <cit> , and may functionally regulate the p <dig> tumor-suppressor gene negatively  <cit> . hccr- <dig> is also overexpressed in various types of human malignancies, including colorectal cancer  <cit> . however, it is not known how hccr- <dig> expression is modulated. in this study, we characterized the proximal promoter region of hccr- <dig> to elucidate the mechanism of expression of the oncoprotein, hccr- <dig> 

RESULTS
characterization of the human hccr- <dig> 5'-flanking sequences
previous work has identified the initiation site for transcription and the promoter region of the hccr- <dig> gene  <cit> . computational analysis has shown that the hccr- <dig> promoter contains a tata box, a caat box, and the putative dna binding sites for various transcriptional factors  <cit> .

to characterize the hccr- <dig> promoter, fragments from positions - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> to position + <dig>  and position - <dig> to position - <dig> were cloned into upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and assayed for their transcriptional activities in either chronic myelogenous leukemia k <dig>  hek/ <dig>  or lung cancer a <dig> cells . the activities from all the constructs tested were high in the k <dig>  but weak in hek/ <dig> and nearly undetectable in a <dig> cells, indicating that the activity of the hccr- <dig> promoter is constitutively enhanced in k <dig> cells. northern blot analysis showed that hccr- <dig> expression is high in k <dig> and weak in a <dig> cells, which is consistent with the present work  <cit> . transient transfection of a reporter fragment containing - <dig> to + <dig> of human hccr- <dig>  had  <dig>  times higher promoter activity than the reporter gene alone  in k <dig> cells . however, the shortest fragment  had high promoter activity, while the deleted mutant  had very weak activity , suggesting that the hccr- <dig> promoter region from - <dig> to + <dig> plays an important role in hccr- <dig> gene expression.

to further characterize the hccr- <dig> promoter region from - <dig> to  <dig>  promoter fragments from positions - <dig> and - <dig> to position + <dig> and from positions - <dig> to position - <dig> were cloned into upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and assayed for their transcriptional activity in k <dig> cells . the fragment  had  <dig>  times higher promoter activity than pgl-75~+ <dig> and  <dig>  times higher promoter activity than pgl3-118~+ <dig> in k <dig> cells. however, this activity was dramatically reduced by the deleted mutant  which was removed at positions - <dig> to + <dig> . these results suggest that the hccr- <dig> 5'-flanking region at positions - <dig> to + <dig> is required for hccr- <dig> promoter activity and this region may possess important elements enhancing hccr- <dig> transcription.

the tcf <dig> site is involved in the activation of the hccr- <dig> promoter
the matinspector  <cit>  identified two t-cell factor  binding sites, designated as tcf <dig> and tcf <dig> in figure  <dig> <cit>  and one c-myb site designated as my in figure  <dig> <cit>  within the - <dig> to + <dig> region of the hccr- <dig> promoter. to investigate the role of these elements in the modulation of transcriptional activity, each was inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis and cloned into upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. each mutated construct  was transiently expressed in k <dig> cells and the luciferase activity was measured. mutation of the tcf <dig> or c-myb-binding sites did not significantly modify luciferase expression . in contrast, mutation of the tcf <dig> site significantly affected hccr- <dig> promoter activity. we thus focused on the tcf <dig> site for further investigations.

nuclear proteins extracted from k <dig> cells recognize the sequences of the tcf <dig> site
to confirm that tcf <dig> plays a role in hccr- <dig> promoter activation, we then performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  in the k <dig> nuclear extracts by using double-stranded oligonucleotides harboring either the hccr- <dig> wild-type sequences, designated as tcf <dig> , tcf <dig> , or a mutated tcf <dig> sequence . two retarded bands were obtained with the radiolabeled probe carried the wild-type tcf <dig> site, but no band in the labeled probe carrying the tcf <dig> site . the band was abolished by pre-incubation with a  <dig> times molar excess of cold tcf <dig> probe, but not abolished with cold probes that carried tcf <dig> or ery  probes, which were used as a non-competitor . the band also disappeared when using the probe encoding the mutated tcf <dig> site, mtcf <dig> , suggesting that proteins included in the k <dig> nuclear extracts recognized and bound to the wild-type specific sequences which are situated in the tcf <dig> site on the hccr- <dig> promoter.

as shown in figure 1b, the reporter fragment containing - <dig> to + <dig> of human hccr- <dig> was significantly increased in comparison with the fragment containing - <dig> to + <dig>  however, emsa assays revealed no major band when the radiolabeled probe carried the hccr- <dig> wild-type tcf <dig> sequences , suggesting that there is another element downstream from the tcf <dig> region to - <dig> of the hccr- <dig> promoter region. we have searched this region, and detected three shifted bands by the emsa method . these bands disappeared in the presence of a cold competitor and were not with the non-competitor. site-directed mutagenesis work also revealed that the region is important for hccr- <dig> expression, but further study is required to gain better insight into the biologic significance in hccr- <dig> expression.

hccr- <dig> promoter was activated by licl, an inhibitor of gsk-3β
lithium has been shown to stabilize β-catenin via inhibition of gsk-3β  <cit> , and as a result, activates tcf. to examine whether tcf activation by treatment with  <dig> mm licl stimulated hccr- <dig> promoter expression  <cit> , we performed reporter assays with deletion constructs containing tcf <dig> or both tcf <dig> and tcf <dig> sites in k <dig> cells . licl treatment increased reporter activities  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold with constructs pgl3-75~+ <dig> -118~+ <dig> which contain the tcf <dig> site, and  <dig> -fold with pgl3-166~+ <dig> containing the tcf <dig> and tcf <dig> sites .

another reporter assay with constructs pgl3-mtcf <dig> or -mtcf <dig>  which are mutated at the tcf <dig> or tcf <dig> sites within the - <dig> to + <dig> region, was performed to verify tcf <dig> involvment in hccr- <dig> promoter activity. pgl3-mtcf <dig> markedly attenuated the induction of hccr- <dig> promoter activity by treatment with licl in comparison with wild-type pgl3-166~+ <dig>  but there was no significant change at the mutation of the tcf <dig> site . these results suggest that tcf <dig> appears to be important for licl-induced activation of the hccr- <dig> promoter.

endogenous hccr- <dig> transcripts were increased by gsk-3β inhibitors
to verify activation induced by stimulation of the wnt/β-catenin signal on endogenous hccr- <dig> mrna expression, k <dig> or hek <dig> cells were treated with various concentration of licl   <cit>  or ar-a <dig>   <cit>  for  <dig> h and the levels of expression were analyzed by real-time pcr. as shown in figure 5a, the stimulated k <dig> cells  were increased the expression of hccr- <dig> compared with unstimulated cells , and the expression was increased  <dig> -fold in the cells treated with  <dig> mm licl and  <dig> -fold with  <dig> μm ar-a <dig> . the expression of hccr- <dig> mrna was increased  <dig> -fold in the hek/ <dig> cells treated with  <dig> mm licl and  <dig> -fold in same cells with  <dig> μm ar-a <dig> . these results suggest that the expression of hccr- <dig> is modulated by the activation of transcription factor, tcf, induced by β-catenin stability.

tcf and β-catenin are bound to the tcf <dig> site on the hccr- <dig> promoter
we have shown that the tcf <dig> site on the hccr- <dig> proximal 5'-flanking region regulates endogenous hccr- <dig> expression. we next investigated whether tcf and its cofactor  could physically bind with the hccr- <dig> promoter using a super-shift assay with the radiolabeled oligo tcf <dig> probes and nuclear extracts from k <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  incubation with either anti-tcf  or anti-β-catenin  antibodies resulted in a super shift of the dna-protein complexes, whereas incubation with a nonspecific igg did not shift the dna-protein complexes, confirming that tcf and β-catenin are bound to the tcf <dig> site on the hccr- <dig> promoter.

wnt signaling is constitutively active in the majority of human colorectal cancers by mutations which lead to increased β-catenin protein expression  <cit> , resulting in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which subsequently complexes with tcf transcription factors and activation of downstream β-catenin/tcf target genes, including bcl- <dig> family genes  <cit> . hccr- <dig> is also overexpressed in colorectal cancer and interacts with dp <dig> on the mitochondrial membrane  <cit> . overexpressed hccr- <dig> may contribute to the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of human tumorigenesis  <cit> . in this study, we characterized the hccr- <dig> promoter and elucidated the mechanism of expression of the strong oncoprotein hccr- <dig>  we found that hccr- <dig> expression is directly modulated by tcf/β-catenin signaling and may play a role in human cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
hccr- <dig> has been isolated as an oncogene candidate and is overexpressed in various cancers  <cit> . to understand the modulation of hccr- <dig> expression, several deleted mutants of the proximal promoter region of hccr- <dig> were constructed. reporter gene assays in k <dig> cells demonstrated that the proximal promoter region at nucleotides - <dig> to + <dig> have a pivotal role in hccr- <dig> transcription. mutagenesis of the tcf <dig> site significantly decreased the reporter activity compared with its wild-type. our data also indicate that the transcription of hccr- <dig> is activated by treatment with licl, the reagent sensitive to gsk-3β. site-directed mutagenesis on the tcf <dig> site makes the hccr- <dig> promoter activity insensitive to the stimulation of β-catenin/tcf signaling by licl. in addition, stimulation with licl or ar-a <dig> also increased endogenous hccr- <dig> expression in k <dig> and hek/ <dig> cells, suggesting that the tcf <dig> site on the hccr- <dig> proximal promoter is a major element for hccr- <dig> expression. finally, we also observed that the transcription factor, tcf, and its cofactor  are indeed bound to the tcf <dig> site.
