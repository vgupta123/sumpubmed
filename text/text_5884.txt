BACKGROUND
peripheral nerve injury typically leads to multiple physiological alterations of the peripheral and central nervous system that includes changes in neuronal phenotype, increased excitability of spinal cord neurons, i.e., central sensitization, glial activation and disinhibition  <cit> . collectively, these phenomena lead to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain, through a complex web of signals and molecules that include inflammatory mediators at the site of injury, neurotransmitters, and chemokines at spinal cord synapses. recent microarray experiments have further identified many genes that may contribute to neuropathic pain  <cit>  therefore, identifying the early events, namely the transcription factors, that trigger neuropathic pain may help to develop therapies to prevent or minimize the symptoms of this debilitating disease. nerve injury induces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin -1beta and il- <dig>  has been shown to play a key role in the propagation of neuropathic pain in animal models and human disease  <cit> . nf-κb is a key transcription factor that regulates the expression of those cytokine genes via the κb motif present in the promoters or enhancers  <cit>  consequently, nf-κb emerges as a potential drug target in the treatment of pathological pain  <cit> 

the κb motif is a gene regulatory element controlling the expression of many genes involved in growth, immunity and inflammation. the regulation of κb-dependent transcription by the rel family of nf-κb is well established  <cit>  recent studies, however, show that a family of large zinc finger proteins, called zas, also shares target genes with nf-κb  <cit> . whereas nf-κb mostly induces transcription, zas proteins can positively  <cit>  or negatively  <cit>  regulate transcription. additionally, a representative zas family member, zas <dig> , associates with an adaptor molecule in the tnfα signal transduction pathway, tnf receptor-associated factor  <dig> , to inhibit the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of nf-κb  <cit>  therefore, the interplay between zas <dig> and nf-κb may control important physiological processes, such as cell growth, apoptosis and cytokine expression.

rna studies have shown that zas <dig> transcripts are expressed specifically in the lymphoid and nervous systems  <cit>  characterization of zas deficient mice suggests that zas <dig> and zas <dig> are involved in lymphoid development. there was a marked deficit in cd4cd <dig> thymocytes in 6-month-old zas3;rag <dig> chimeric mice, suggesting that zas <dig> is involved in t lymphocyte survival  <cit> . in addition, nf-κb is constitutively activated in zas3-deficient b cells, supporting the notion that zas <dig> associates with traf <dig> to inhibit nf-κb activation  <cit> . similarly, in zas2-deficient mice, dramatic enhancement in the differentiation into t helper type  <dig> cells, constitutive activation of nf-κb, and enhanced gata <dig> induction were observed  <cit> . therefore, the zas proteins are able to inhibit nf-κb-driven transcription by competing with nf-κb for binding to dna sequences similar to the κb motif and by inhibiting nf-κb activation  <cit> . however, the role of zas in the nervous system has not been studied. in the present work, zas <dig> proteins in nervous tissues have been characterized using two independent zas <dig> antisera. abundant zas <dig> expression is found in neuronal cell bodies of the hippocampus formation, trigeminal ganglion, dorsal root ganglia , and motoneurons, and in astrocytes of the brain and spinal cord. additionally, the down-regulation of zas <dig> and up-regulation of nf-κb in drg after peripheral nerve injury suggests these κb-transcriptional proteins may be involved in neuronal regeneration and neuropathic pain.

RESULTS
the distribution of zas <dig> proteins in the rat nervous tissues was first determined by immunohistochemical procedures using zas3-specific antisera, abn and abc. those antisera were raised against fusion proteins containing different vector encoded sequences and distinct regions of zas <dig> . each antiserum only interacted with the cognate antigens  <cit> . consecutive rat coronal brain sections corresponded to the plane of bregma from - <dig> mm to - <dig> mm according to a stereotaxic atlas  <cit> , longitudinal sections of isolated trigeminal ganglion, l <dig> to l <dig> drg, and cross-sections of lumbar spinal cord were examined.

zas <dig> expression in trigeminal ganglion
zas3-immunoreactivity  was readily observed in the trigeminal ganglion, in agreement with abundant zas <dig> transcripts present in this tissue  <cit> . the signal intensity was strong from neuronal cell bodies and weak from nerve fibers . examination of individual ganglion nerve cell bodies under high power magnification revealed that signals derived from abn were distributed uniformly between cytoplasm and nucleus , whereas abc yielded more intense signals from the nucleus .

zas <dig> in dorsal root ganglia
drg was another nervous tissue where zas3-ir was readily observed . notably, abn yielded intense signals mainly from large neurons, whereas abc yielded similar signals from large, medium and small neurons. similar to the immunostaining of the trigeminal ganglion, abc yielded more prominent signals from the nuclei than from cytoplasm of drg neurons, whereas signals from abn were mostly cytoplasmic.

zas <dig> in neurons and astrocytes of hippocampal formation and cerebral cortex
inspection of coronal sections through the septal half of the hippocampus showed abundant zas3-ir at the hippocampal formation . the expression of zas <dig> transcripts in the hippocampus of mouse embryos had not been seen in previous studies because para-sagittal sections were used for in situ hybridization  <cit>  neuronal cell bodies, including the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus proper ammon's horn fields ca <dig>  ca <dig> and ca <dig>  and granule cells of the dentate gyrus, appeared as dark granules at low magnifications when stained with cresyl violet . cresyl violet reacted with the nissl substance that was abundant in neuronal cell bodies. the pattern of zas3-ir in the hippocampal formation resembled that of cresyl violet in that both stained neuronal cell bodies .

the granule layer of the dentate gyrus consists mostly of neurons, whereas the pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus have a larger glial population relative to neurons. in these hippocampus regions, abc labeled only neurons . on the other hand, abn yielded modest labeling of neurons and more intense labeling of adjacent star-like cells that had elaborate processes . similar differential labeling pattern of both antibodies was observed in the cerebral cortex. double labeling of the cortex with an antibody for the astroglial marker gfap  <cit>  confirmed that those abn-positive cells were astrocytes . additionally, in neurons of hippocampus formation and cerebral cortex, abn yielded stronger signals from the cytoplasm than from the nucleus . on the other hand, the abc signal was observed in nuclei but not in cytoplasm of neurons in the hippocampus . further, double labeling experiments with abc and gfap antibodies revealed that abc only yielded signals from neurons but not from gfap-positive cells. the ability of abn but not abc to react with astrocytes suggests that astrocytes may produce a zas <dig> isoform that does not contain the zasc domain.

zas <dig> in motoneurons
the overall expression of zas <dig> was low in the lumbar spinal cord, where a more intense signal was observed in the grey matter than the white matter . notably, abundant zas3-ir was observed in motoneurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord . double staining with zas <dig> antibodies and dapi showed some cell nuclei that were devoid of zas <dig> , showing that these antisera stained cells specifically. again, abc stained only the nuclei, whereas abn stained both the nuclei and cytoplasm of motoneuorns. in addition, abn also stained astrocytes, which were also positively labeling by antibodies against gfap . as in the brain tissues examined, abc stained only neurons in the spinal cord, whereas abn stained both neurons and astrocytes.

the distribution of zas <dig> in various nervous tissues examined is summarized in table  <dig>  the similar tissue distribution of immunoreactivity derived from abn and abc, antibodies that were raised against distinct regions of zas <dig>  suggests that these antibodies are specific for the endogenous proteins. in addition, abc-ir is generally more abundant in the nucleus than cytoplasm, whereas the reverse is true for abn. furthermore, both zas <dig> antibodies reacted with neurons, whereas only abn also reacted with gfap-positive cells, which are astrocytes.

production of zas <dig> protein isoforms
next, immunoblot analyses were performed to clarify the origin of the observed differences in the intensity of zas3-irs between cytoplasm and nucleus. in total lysates of the brain, abc reacted with two protein species of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda in size . the smaller  <dig> kda zas <dig> was present in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, whereas the  <dig> kda zas <dig> was observed only in the nuclear extracts . abc also reacted with two species in drg, but with slightly retarded gel mobilities . the slower migrating species was found in the nuclear extracts, whereas the faster migrating species was present in the cytoplasmic extracts . on the other hand, abn reacted with a single  <dig> kda species in the brain, but with two species of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda in drg . in drg, the  <dig> kda species was observed in the nuclear extracts, whereas the  <dig> kda protein was found in the cytoplasmic extracts. in general, the relative signal intensity observed from cytoplasmic extracts and nuclear extracts in immunoblotting was consistent with what we had observed in the immunohistochemical studies. the various species reacting with the zas <dig> antibodies suggest that zas <dig> isoforms were produced in a tissue-specific manner. as controls, equivalent loadings were visualized by protein staining before transferring proteins from gels onto nitrocellulose membranes, and p65-irs were detected mainly from total protein lysates and cytoplasmic extracts, and minimally from nuclear extracts . in most cell types, p <dig> associated with iκb and was therefore sequestered in the cytoplasm. the difference in gel mobility, immunogenicity, and cytoplasmic or nuclear distribution of zas <dig> isoforms suggest that the regulation of zas <dig> expression is complex and is different between brain and drg.

spnl rats exhibit allodynia
a widely used peripheral neuropathy model, the l5/l <dig> spinal nerve ligation model   <cit>  was used to examine whether zas <dig> may have a role in regenerative responses after peripheral nerve injury. persistent allodynia, pain resulting from a non-painful stimulus, such as a light touch, is also a common characteristic of neuropathy. the behavioral changes of spnl rats due to neuropathic pain after spinal nerve injury were confirmed by exhibition of mechanical allodynia in the left rear paw, i.e. the side ipsilateral to surgery, at day  <dig> post-operative. spnl pre-surgery =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g, post-surgery =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g; p =  <dig>  two-tailed mann-whitney non-parametric . sham rats did not exhibit allodynia ; spnl rats had maximum test values on the contralateral side  <dig> days post-surgery.

in silico cloning of rat zas3
the relative amount of zas <dig> transcripts from ipsilateral and contralateral l <dig> and l <dig> drg was compared by rt-pcr. because rat zas <dig> had not been cloned, we first compiled an  <dig> bp rat zas <dig> cdna by in silico cloning procedure as described in experimental procedures. the open reading frame of rat zas <dig> encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids, which is 92% identical to the mouse counterpart . the cdna was derived from  <dig> exons and covering a genomic region of  <dig> kb. because the 5' end of the rat zas <dig> gene has not been characterized, the exon numbering of the mouse gene was used . the 3' organization of the rat zas <dig> gene was largely similar to the mouse gene, and the exon and intron boundaries were also conserved. genbank databases contained a shorter rat zas <dig> cdna of  <dig> bp , which was predicted by automated computational analysis of the gene sequence. although xm_ <dig> was shorter, it encoded  <dig> amino acids because it contained an insertion of  <dig> bp between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  a comparison with the genomic sequence showed that those extra sequences were derived from two putative protein-coding exons . that  <dig> bp sequence, however, were not conserved in humans or mice, casting doubts onto its authenticity of being included in mature transcripts.

downregulation of zas transcripts in spnl rats
seven days post-surgery, l <dig> and l <dig> drgs were analyzed for zas <dig> mrna expression by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. two primer sets were used to amplify distinct regions. the 5' region covers a  <dig> bp sequence, which corresponds to intron  <dig> of the mouse zas <dig> gene. intron  <dig> is unusual in that when retained in transcripts it encodes the zasn domain  <cit> . as in the mouse, the corresponding sequence in the rat starts with gc and ends with ag, which are splicing dinucleotides, allowing that  <dig> nucleotide sequence to serve as a potential intron. the 3' region contains exon  <dig>  which is a  <dig> nucleotide sequence that encodes the carboxyl zinc finger pair of the zasc domain. those regions were chosen for amplification because they have been shown to be involved in alternative splicing in mouse . the alternative splicing of intron  <dig> will lead to the production of zas <dig> protein isoforms that lack the zasn domain, whereas alternative splicing of exon  <dig> will lead to premature translation termination and production of carboxyl-truncated proteins that lack the zasc domain  <cit> .

seven days after spnl surgery, zas <dig> mrna levels were less in ipsilateral drg than in contralateral drg, suggesting that zas <dig> is downregulated in spnl . the formation of two pcr products of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp using the 3' primer set showed that exon  <dig> of rat , as in humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit> , was also involved in alternative splicing. because the extra sequence in xm_ <dig> described in the above lies between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> , the lack of larger pcr products in this experiment supports our notion that the  <dig> bp sequence do not correspond to exons. on the other hand, alternative splicing of the zasn region was not evident because only a pcr product of  <dig> bp, but no smaller products, was produced using the 5' primer set . to determine whether downregulation in spnl was specific for zas <dig> in the zas gene family, rt-pcr was also performed with zas <dig> and zas <dig> specific primer sets. zas <dig> and zas <dig> were also downregulated in drg after spnl. nerve growth factor , whose expression was upregulated in spnl  <cit> , was used as a control for spnl . data from four independent experiments were summarized and presented in the lower panel of figure 8a.

downregulation of zas <dig> proteins and upregulation of nf-κb in spnl
immunoblot analysis of total protein lysates revealed two species of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda that reacted with abc in contralateral drg . in ipsilateral drg, only the faster migrating species was observed . similarly, the  <dig> kda species, which reacted with abn, was significantly diminished in ipsilateral drg . consistent with a decrease of zas <dig> and the inhibitory role of zas <dig> on nf-κb, the amount of p <dig> in the ipsilateral drg was higher than that in the contralateral drg . furthermore, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic p <dig> in drg of neuropathic rat was higher than that of sham rat . the protein filter was also hybridized with antibodies against histone h <dig> as a control for nuclear extracts. therefore, in spnl zas <dig> was downregulated while nf-κb was upregulated.

discussion
this study localizes zas <dig> protein expression in neuronal cell bodies of the hippocampus proper and dentate gyrus , which contain groups of nerves that play a crucial role in the mechanisms of learning, emotion and memory. abundant zas <dig> protein expression was also found in the trigeminal ganglion and drg . the trigeminal ganglion and drg are equivalent structures, containing mostly neural crest-derived sensory neurons, which convey pain information from peripheral to central nervous system. drg contain the spinal nerve's cell bodies and receive signals from the site of peripheral nerve injury to affect transcription and alter expression of neurotransmitters, receptors, and ion channels involved in modulating nociception. additionally, zas <dig> expression is found in astrocytes in brain and spinal cord. astrocytes are the major cell type in the brain and spinal cord whose function was previously thought to be limited to maintaining homeostasis for neuronal signaling  <cit> . recently, we have shown increased astrocyte reactivity in the spinal cord after spnl  <cit> , and astrocyte activation is regarded as a driving force for creating and maintaining pathological pain states  <cit> .

the expression pattern of zas <dig> in the nervous system prompted us to investigate whether zas <dig> plays a role in neuropathic pain, a pathological condition in which pain is evoked at much lower stimulus thresholds and often with greater severity. zas <dig> inhibits nf-κb, which regulates the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnfα. inflammation can lower nociceptor thresholds and increase neuronal excitability. we show for the first time that the expression of zas <dig> and its related genes, zas <dig> and zas <dig>  is decreased in the ipsilateral versus contralateral l <dig> drg seven days after spnl . rat drg neurons survive and regenerate injured axons after nerve injury  <cit> . because zas <dig> suppresses growth  <cit> . and nf-κb acts as a survival factor and promotes growth, the downregulation of zas <dig> and upregulation of nf-κb might be adaptations for sensory neuron mediated axonal regeneration after peripheral nerve injury.

it has been shown that injection of a nf-κb decoy, inhibitor for ikappab kinase , or a tnfα antagonist to or near nerve lesions attenuated spnl-induced mechanical allodynia or the upregulation of nf-κb-dependent genes  <cit> . in agreement with previous findings which showed that zas <dig> inhibits nf-κb  <cit> , the downregulation of zas <dig> is in parallel with upregulation of nf-κb in spnl. therefore, the data suggest that a neuronal inflammatory cascade in drg that involves zas <dig> and nf-κb may be important for the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. the expression of zas <dig> in neurons of drg and trigeminal ganglia, and in astrocytes, together with its reduction in drg after spnl suggest that zas <dig> may influence the genetic programming of sensory neurons and astrocytes, leading to neuropathic pain.

immuno-studies show zas <dig> protein isoforms of  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda are produced in drg of naïve rats. the  <dig> kda species, which reacted with both zas <dig> antisera, is located in the nucleus, whereas the  <dig> kda species, which reacted with abn but not abc, is located in the cytoplasm . likely, these zas <dig> protein isoforms may perform distinct functions in drg. the size of the larger zas <dig> proteins and their immunogenicitysuggest it is most likely a zas <dig> protein isoform that is generated by an alternatively spliced zas <dig> transcript in which exon  <dig> was spliced out . alternative splicing of exon  <dig> is demonstrated by the smaller pcr product in rt-pcr using the 3' primer set . zas <dig> transcripts that lack exon  <dig> will produce a truncated protein of  <dig> amino acid residues that contains the zasn domain, zinc finger  <dig> and the middle conserved region, but lacks the zasc domain .

the  <dig> kda cytoplasmic zas <dig> protein isoform reacted with abn but not with abc. abn was raised against a fusion protein that contained the zasn domain . in the mouse zas <dig> gene, the zasn domain is encoded by intron  <dig> when it is retained in the mature transcript  <cit> . exon 10-intron10-exon  <dig> together are more than  <dig>  kb in size and encodes the first  <dig> amino acids. therefore, the  <dig> kda zas <dig> protein isoform should be generated by an undefined alternative splicing event or by protein processing. previously, it has been shown that this protein region associates with traf <dig> to inhibit tnfα/nf-κb signaling and with c-jun to induce ap <dig> transcription  <cit>  therefore, the cytoplasmic  <dig> kda protein is an appropriate zas <dig> candidate isoform for the regulation of signal transduction.

as in most cell types, nf-κb is present mainly in the cytoplasm of unstimulated drg neurons  <cit> . immunoblot analyses show that in spnl, the overall amount and nuclear localization of p <dig> in ipsilateral drg was more than those in contralateral drg . a similar increase and activation  of p65-ir was observed in ipsilateral drg neurons after tight ligation of the sciatic nerve  <cit> . likely, upregulation and activation of nf-κb is a general response to peripheral nerve injury. in spnl, downregulation of zas <dig> may lead to the translocation of nf-κb from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. nf-κb activation, and a release of κb-dna binding competition and transcription repression by zas <dig> together in turn activates nf-κb-dependent gene expression, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, sensitization of neurons, and neuropathic pain. our observation suggests that after nerve injury, downregulation of zas <dig> may activate a cascade of nf-κb signal transduction and transcriptional events which leads to neuronal regeneration and neuropathic pain. hence, via its regulatory role on nf-κb, zas <dig> might be a new target for the prevention, management, and resolution of persistent pain states following nerve injury.

CONCLUSIONS
this report is the first to characterize the protein expression and function of a large zinc finger protein zas <dig> in the nervous system, and use an animal model to demonstrate a functional relationship between zas <dig> and nf-κb. previous rna studies have shown specific expression of zas <dig> in lymphoid and nervous tissues. here immunohistochemical studies further localize zas <dig> expression to specific regions of the brain, including trigeminal ganglion and hippocampus formation, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. additionally, the cell-types that expressed zas <dig> in the nervous tissues are refined to neurons and astrocytes. the cellular distribution of the immunoreactivity and the results of western blot analysis using cytoplasmic extracts and nuclear extracts suggest that zas <dig> protein isoforms with differential cellular localization are produced in a tissue-specific manner. the notion that zas <dig> may safe-guard cells from aberrant nf-κb activation stems from the fact that zas <dig> and nf-κb share similar dna targets, the κb motif or similar sequences and that nf-κb is activated in zas3-knockout cells. in vitro studies further show that zas <dig> may inhibit the activation of nf-κb by associating with traf <dig>  traf <dig> is an adaptor molecule essential for the assembly of a kinase complex that ultimately activates nf-κb. in this report, we further show the effect of l <dig> and l <dig> spinal nerve ligation , a neuropathic pain model, on the expression of zas <dig> and nf-κb. in spnl, zas <dig> transcripts and proteins are downregulated, whereas nf-κb is upregulated and activated. thus, the reciprocal expression of zas <dig> and nf-κb in the neuropathic pain model described here provides a relevant physiological model to demonstrate the intimate functional relationship of these κb binding proteins, and suggest that downregulation of zas <dig> followed by upregulation of nf-κb to be two initial steps that triggers a cascade of gene activation and signaling events that lead to cytokine expression, and consequently, neuropathic pain.
