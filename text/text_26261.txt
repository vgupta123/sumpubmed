BACKGROUND
an important consequence of reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on proteins is the creation of binding sites for phosphotyrosine recognizing domains such as src homology  <dig>  and phosphotyrosine binding  domains  <cit> . the human proteome contains  <dig> sh <dig> domains in  <dig> distinct proteins, and protein-protein interactions mediated by sh <dig> domains play a critical role in essential cellular processes such as cell growth, migration, differentiation, and survival  <cit> . we and others have utilized sh <dig> domains as a tool to profile the global tyrosine phosphorylation state of cells . sh <dig> profiling is a unique proteomic method in which interactions between an array of sh <dig> domains and protein samples are quantitatively analyzed, thereby defining the functional output of tyrosine phosphorylation. there are three assay platforms for sh <dig> profiling: quantitative far-western, rosette, and oligonucleotide-tagged multiplex  assays  <cit> . in far-western, protein samples are separated by electrophoresis and replicate blots are separately probed with labeled sh <dig> domains  <cit> . in rosette assay, samples are spotted on a membrane, and the binding assay is carried out in a 96-well plate  <cit> . the labeled sh <dig> domain probes are incubated with multiple sample spots in a noncompetitive manner . in an oligonucleotide-tagged multiplex  assay, a mixture of sh <dig> domains with domain-specific dna tags are incubated with a sample spot allowing for competitive binding   <cit> . signal is detected either by chemiluminescence  or by pcr . quantified values are used to classify samples, such as different cancer tissues, based on sh <dig> binding preferences   <cit> .

one limitation of current sh <dig> profiling methods is that these assays themselves do not provide the identity of the binding proteins. when the sample identity is known, such as synthesized peptides or purified proteins, this is not a problem. however, for samples with more complexity such as cell lysate and tissue, it is often difficult to infer the identity of detected sh <dig> binding proteins unless a literature/database search can provide a helpful clue. in this case, additional experimental methods such as antibody-based or mass spectrometry-based protein identification must be combined with sh <dig> profiling. for example, in order to identify a band detected by sh2-far-western, a pull down assay combined with western blotting with specific antibodies  or ms identification  is needed  <cit> . further, those additional assays often require a large amount of sample, are labor intensive and not always successful  <cit> . these laborious, costly procedures are required for even a simple task such as validating the binding of sh <dig> domains to a few candidate proteins  which have been inferred from sh <dig> profiling.

proximity ligation assay  is a molecular recognition assay that depends on the ligation of two oligonucleotide-tagged probes that are capable of forming a complex, when binding to a target  that are in close proximity to each other  <cit> . the method was originally described using aptamers as affinity reagents  <cit> , and in its current version is performed using antibodies to determine protein expression and interactions in situ or in solution . various commercial pla kits are available mainly from olink bioscience and applied biosystems. of these, applied biosystems taqman protein assays are designed to quantify target protein expression levels using a small amount of cell lysate   <cit> . the system uses taqman technology, an established platform for quantification of gene expression based on quantitative real-time pcr. the standard taqman protein assay kit was originally designed to detect stem cell markers, while an open kit is available for use with custom antibodies  <cit> . although homogenous pla has been used to determine protein expression in lysate  <cit> , we hypothesized that the system could be customized for detection of sh <dig> domain-based protein-protein interactions in solution. a pla-based sh <dig> profiling method would have multiple advantages such as low sample requirement, higher sensitivity, and rapid validation of sh <dig> binding protein identity. here, using activated epidermal growth factor receptor  as the sh <dig> binding target, we have developed and validated such an assay, termed sh2-pla, which has a broad range of detection, performance equivalent to far-western, and potential application in translational research .

RESULTS
sh2-pla assay scheme
we chose the epidermoid carcinoma cell line a <dig>  which overexpresses wild type epidermal growth factor receptor , as a developmental platform. the premise of the sh2-pla assay is that 1) egf stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of egfr, which creates specific binding sites for sh <dig> domains such as grb <dig>  src, plcγ <dig>  vav <dig>  etc.; 2) gst-sh <dig> domain coupled to anti-gst 5′ prox-oligo binds to these phosphotyrosines in cell lysate; 3) this interaction brings the anti-gst 5′ prox-oligo and anti-egfr 3′ prox-oligo probes together in close proximity, thus allowing for the proximity ligation reaction to be subsequently quantified by real-time pcr . in other words, detection of a specific assay signal requires the creation of the quaternary complex: anti-egfr 3′prox-oligo probe:phosphorylated egfr:gst-sh <dig> protein:anti-gst 5′ prox-oligo probe.fig.  <dig> in-solution sh <dig> domain binding assay using proximity ligation and real-time pcr. a
, schematic illustration of sh2-pla. a pair of pla probes is used to detect the interaction of tyrosine phosphorylated egfr and a gst-sh <dig> domain. the 3′ sh2-pla probe consists of an anti-egfr antibody conjugated with the 3′ proximity oligonucleotide . the 5′ sh2-pla probes consists of an anti-gst antibody conjugated with the 5′ prox-oligo and a gst-sh <dig> domain. when the gst-sh <dig> domain binds to tyrosine phosphorylation sites of egfr, the 5′ and 3′ pla probes are brought in close proximity, allowing ligation of the two prox-oligos which is detectable by real-time pcr. b

performance of taqman protein expression assay
prior to customizing the taqman protein expression assay for sh2-pla , we tested the performance of the original proximity ligation assay using the kit-supplied anti-icam <dig> assay probes and raji b-cell lymphoma lysate. the 3′ and 5′ oligonucleotide-conjugated anti-icam <dig> assay probes were incubated with the raji lysate for 60 min followed by the ligation reaction. after heat inactivation, the ligation product was quantified using the taqman real-time pcr system. the experiment was performed in a  <dig> well plate with approximately three hours of assay time. we observed, with high-precision, approximately three orders of magnitude of linear dynamic range for a cell input of  <dig>  –  <dig> cells per μl  . when two independent experiments were compared, they showed very strong correlation  . we concluded that the performance of the taqman protein expression assay was sufficient for development of an sh <dig> domain binding assay.

development of the sh2-pla assay
biotinylated anti-gst and anti-egfr polyclonal antibodies were conjugated with 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides following the probe development protocol . to evaluate the anti-gst probes  and anti-egfr probes , purified gst protein and a <dig> cell lysate were serially diluted and respective taqman protein expression assays were performed as in the icam <dig> expression assay. in these separate detection experiments for gst and egfr, we observed that the gst probe had a linear increase in ct values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm of gst input, while the egfr probe for a <dig> lysate was linear from  <dig>  to 30 μg/ml .

next we tested the ability of the 5′ prox-oligo-conjugated anti-gst antibody and 3′ prox-oligo-conjugated anti-egfr antibody pair to detect an interaction between the gst-sh <dig> and egfr in a <dig> lysate. among multiple attempts performed to optimize the binding conditions, we found two distinct methods that provided a favorable signal-to-noise profile . in method  <dig>  antibodies are premixed with target proteins prior to sh <dig> binding, while in method  <dig>  gst-sh <dig> domains and egfr  are incubated prior to antibody binding . as the results from both methods were nearly equivalent, method  <dig>  was used for all experiments described in this report.

specificity of the sh2-pla
a <dig> cell lysates were prepared in the presence or absence of egf stimulation and the sh2-pla assay was performed as outlined in fig. 1b. we employed several sh <dig> domain containing proteins for validation that are known to be physiological ligands of egfr such as grb <dig>  vav <dig>  and plcγ <dig> . figure 2a shows a representative real-time pcr amplification plot of the sh2-pla assay using the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain probe and a <dig> cell samples. pcr product in the egf-stimulated a <dig> sample was amplified more rapidly than in the unstimulated sample resulting in a lower threshold cycle  value. the difference in ct values between the two samples  is an indicator of enhanced binding by the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain probe to tyrosine phosphorylated egfr . to validate the specificity of the assay, we compared signal from a gst-sh <dig> domain probe and gst control. the ct value for the gst control was unchanged with egf stimulation . on the other hand, the sh <dig> domains of grb <dig> and plcγ <dig> showed a marked reduction in their ct values upon stimulation . using the same set of samples and sh <dig> domains, far-western blotting was performed as a reference . in far-western, proteins were separated on polyacrylamide and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane which was then probed with hrp-labeled gst-sh <dig> domains  <cit> . the identity of a major band at approximately  <dig> kda in the sh2-far-western blotting has previously been confirmed to be egfr by anti-egfr immunodepletion . as shown in the middle panel of fig. 2b, the signal profiles of the sh2-pla and far-western are similar despite their use of distinctive assay readouts . sh <dig> domains are known to have both unique and overlapping ligand binding characteristics . to determine if the sh <dig> binding is tyrosine site dependent, a synthesized phosphopeptide corresponding to egfr tyrosine  <dig>  containing the grb <dig> sh <dig> consensus binding site, was added as a blocker. in both assays, grb <dig> sh <dig> binding was significantly reduced in the presence of the blocker, while the blocking effect on plcγ sh <dig> domain binding was relatively modest . taken together, these results indicate that, like far-western, the sh2-pla assay performed with the anti-gst 5′ prox-oligo antibody and anti-egfr 3′ prox-oligo antibody probe pair is specific enough to distinguish between egf-stimulated and control cell samples.fig.  <dig> validation of the sh2-pla assay. a

b, specificity of sh2-pla. sh2-pla  and far-western  results for egf-stimulated and control a <dig> cell samples are shown. results for gst control probe are shown in lanes 1–4; grb <dig> sh <dig> probe in lanes 5–8; and plcγ <dig> tandem sh <dig> probe in lanes 9– <dig>  lanes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show the assay result in the presence of py <dig> blocking peptide, which contains the grb <dig> sh <dig> consensus binding site of egfr. c
, sh2-pla assay performance. the sh2-pla assay was performed three times using a two fold dilution series of egf-stimulated and control a <dig> cell lysates. average ct values, normalized to non protein control , are shown in the upper panel. the intra-assay variation for ct values was  <dig> - <dig>   and the inter-assay %cv was  <dig> - <dig>  . since egf-stimulated samples always showed a greater signal  than the unstimulated control throughout the dilution series, the range of assay detection is estimated to be at least  <dig> –1100 μg/ml of lysate concentration, and the lower limit of detection is approximately 2 ng of protein per assay. the lower panel shows the approximately linear region of the mean ct plot against log input lysate concentrations, and the ∆ct  of about three cycles. the log <dig> fold change between egf-stimulated and control samples was estimated to be  <dig>  -  <dig>  using the proteinassist software tool . d, adoption of other phosphotyrosine recognizing domains. the sh2-pla methodology was applied to protein tyrosine phosphatase  and phosphotyrosine binding  domains. shca ptb domain and the substrate-trapping mutant of ptp1b ptp domain displayed activity comparable to grb <dig> sh <dig> . signal was undetectable for the wild type  ptp1b ptp domain, likely due to the intrinsic phosphatase activity 



performance of the sh2-pla assay
to evaluate assay performance, including the limit of detection, linearity, and precision, we performed the sh2-pla assay using a serial dilution of lysate. in a  <dig> well plate, egf-stimulated and control a <dig> cell lysates at concentrations between  <dig>  and 1100 μg/ml were incubated with the grb <dig> sh <dig> probe. surprisingly, at all  <dig> lysate concentrations tested, egf-stimulated samples showed a greater signal  than unstimulated samples, demonstrating the high sensitivity of the system . however, at higher lysate concentrations , suppressed signal was observed , consistent with other reports using homogeneous proximity ligation assays  <cit> . this is often referred to as the “high-dose hook effect” and has been observed in other antibody based assays . as a result, the assay had a linear signal response range of a 1– <dig> order of magnitude . in addition, the slopes of stimulated and unstimulated samples, an indicator of pcr amplification efficiency, were slightly different suggesting that conventional ∆∆ct or standard curve methods are not suitable for relative quantification of sh <dig> binding. therefore, we utilized proteinassist, a software tool designed for fold change estimation in taqman protein expression assays based the ∆ct squared method  <cit> . with this method, the log <dig> fold change between egf-stimulated and control samples was estimated to be  <dig>  -  <dig>  . based on three independent assays, the intra-assay variation of ∆ct values was  <dig> - <dig>   and the inter-assay %cv was  <dig> - <dig>  % . taken together, these results suggest that the limit of detection and precision are favorable, but the linear signal response range is modest, likely due to the binding characteristics of antibodies and probes.

application to other ptyr recognition domains
in addition to sh <dig> domains, members of the phosphotyrosine binding  and tyrosine phosphatase  domain families are also known to recognize phosphotyrosine residues and play regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase pathways  <cit> . considering their potential applications in phosphoproteomics research, we tested if the same sh2-pla methodology is applicable to these domains. gst-fusion proteins of the shca ptb domain, wild type ptp1b ptp domain, and catalytically inactive  mutant ptp1b ptp domain were purified and subjected to the assay using the same protocol as for sh <dig> domains. as shown in fig. 2d, shca ptb and the catalytically inactive ptp domain of ptp1b showed binding activity to pegfr comparable to the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain, while the wild type ptp domain, having intrinsic ptp activity, showed no binding.

estimation of egfr phosphotyrosines at the limit of detection
the serial dilution experiment indicated that the limit of detection is about 2 ng protein per assay in the case of a <dig> cells, although this threshold could change for other cell lines with different egfr expression levels. a titration experiment using a “spike-in” pegfr protein control would address the ambiguity, but preparation of such a reagent is challenging. therefore, we took a retrospective approach in which a series of quantification methods were combined to measure the absolute amount of egfr phosphotyrosine in the minimum amount of cell lysate necessary for sh2-pla.

first, using a baculovirus expression system, we generated recombinant gst fused c-abl protein to serve as the standard for phosphotyrosine. then we treated the abl protein with the tyrosine specific phosphatases ptp1b and tc-ptp. anti-phosphotyrosine blots of treated and untreated abl proteins indicated that phosphorylated abl protein was mostly dephosphorylated by phosphatase treatment. following the treatment, we quantified the amount of free phosphate, which is the hydrolyzed product of phosphotyrosine, using a phosphate standard curve generated with a malachite green phosphatase assay .fig.  <dig> estimation of egfr phosphotyrosines at the limit of detection. to define an absolute lower limit of detection  for sh2-pla, the total amount of egfr phosphotyrosines in sample cell lysate was estimated using a phosphotyrosine standard sample and quantitative dot blotting analyses. a, recombinant c-abl protein, the ptyr-standard sample, was treated with tyrosine specific phosphatases ptp1b and tc-ptp. the amount of hydrolyzed phosphotyrosine was quantified by malachite green phosphatase assay . left panel shows anti-abl and anti-phosphotyrosine blots for phosphatase-treated  and -untreated  samples. after the ptp treatment, the level of c-abl tyrosine phosphorylation was greatly reduced but weak phosphorylation was still detectable with longer exposure time. the right panel shows a plot of the phosphate standard used for the quantification. red circle, untreated c-abl; blue circle, ptp-treated c-abl; yellow circles, the kit supplied phosphate standard. from this analysis, ∆abl po4
 <dig> was estimated to be  <dig>  pmol per μg of the c-abl protein. b
, quantitative dot blotting. the total ptyr in the egf-stimulated cos <dig> cell lysate was estimated from a ptyr standard curve generated from anti-phosphotyrosine dot blotting. upper panel shows raw anti-abl and anti-ptyr blots. serially diluted c-abl ptyr standard  and  <dig>  μg egf-stimulated cos <dig> samples were spotted on nitrocellulose membrane . the middle panel shows the resulting ptyr standard plot with the quantified signal intensities. the ptyr amount in the egf-stimulated cos <dig> lysate was estimated to be  <dig>  pmol per μg lysate. subsequently, an anti-ptyr western analysis for a <dig> and cos <dig> samples was performed, relative intensities of the egfr bands were calculated, and the amount of egfr ptyr in the egf-stimulated a <dig> sample was estimated to be  <dig>  pmol/μg. thus 2 ng of egf-stimulated a <dig> sample, which is the lower limit for sh2-pla detection, would contain  <dig>  femtomole egfr ptyr. see methods and additional file 1: figure s <dig> for more information



next, anti-phosphotyrosine dot blotting was performed and the amount of total phosphotyrosine in egf-stimulated cos  <dig> lysate was estimated using the abl standard . finally, the tyrosine phosphorylation of egfr was estimated by comparing the egfr band intensity with the whole band intensity on an anti-phosphotyrosine western blot . according to these analyses, we estimated that  <dig>  pmol phosphotyrosine is present on egfr in 1 μg of egf-stimulated a <dig> cell lysate. thus in 2 ng lysate, which is the quantification limit of sh2-pla , there is  <dig>  fmol of phosphotyrosine on egfr . in addition, assuming that a <dig> has  <dig>  million egfr per cell  and 150 pg of total protein per cell  <cit> , we estimated that on average 4– <dig> tyrosines out of  <dig> putative tyrosine phosphorylated sites  <cit>  per egfr molecule are phosphorylated in egf-stimulated a <dig> cells .

practical limit of detection from cell culture
since the lysate dilution experiment indicated that the lysate requirement for sh2-pla is very low, we next determined the lower limit of the assay by cell numbers. serially diluted a <dig> cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, starved 16 h, and stimulated with egf. cells were lysed in the same volume of buffer and interaction between egfr and vav <dig> sh <dig> was analyzed by sh2-pla. as shown in fig. 4a, the assay detected egf dependent sh <dig> interaction in the lysate equivalent of  <dig> cells  or approximately  <dig>  ng which is close to the detection limit calculated above . in addition to egfr-overexpressing a <dig> cells, we performed a similar lysate dilution experiment using egf stimulated cos <dig> cells and found that a lysate concentration approximately four times higher is required for detection, consistent with modest egfr phosphorylation in cos <dig> cells . these results demonstrate that sh2-pla is capable of detecting interaction between sh <dig> domains and pegfr using a very small number of cultured cells.fig.  <dig> applications of sh2-pla assay. a, practical limit of detection from cell culture. two-fold serial dilutions of a <dig> cells were seeded to wells in a 96-well plate. image series shows various 10x magnifications of diluted a <dig> cells with cell number indicated. vav <dig> sh2:pegfr interaction of starved or egf-stimulated cell lysates was quantified by the sh2-pla assay to resolve the assay detection limit. the ct values from real-time pcr are shown with approximate numbers of cells per culture well or per assay  underneath the chart. b

correlation between sh2-pla and far-western in kinetic analyses
defining phosphorylation kinetics in growth factor stimulated cells is important in cell signaling studies. we applied the sh2-pla approach to determine time-dependent and dose-dependent changes in sh <dig> binding to pegfr using a <dig> and cos <dig> cells . for cross-validation, we performed far-western analysis and compared the results side by side. as shown in fig. 4b, the dose- and time-dependent increases in grb <dig> sh <dig> binding to egfr were obvious both by far-western  and sh2-pla . when corresponding signal values  of both assays were compared, there was a high correlation  . these results suggest that sh2-pla is capable of analyzing cells with various levels of egfr expression and is able to produce quantitative results similar to those obtained from established protein-protein interaction assays  in a significantly shorter assay time while using 10– <dig> times less sample.

application of sh2-pla for cancer tissue analysis
to explore the translational application of sh2-pla, we analyzed binding of grb <dig> sh <dig> to egfr in lung cancer patient tissues. empirically, the tyrosine phosphorylation analysis of patient-derived solid tumors is challenging due to intrinsically high protease and phosphatase activities requiring phospho-enrichment and larger starting material  <cit> . we asked if sh2-pla is capable of detecting a specific signal within human lung cancer tissues without ptyr enrichment. in collaboration with the haura group at the moffit cancer center, we obtained  <dig> non-small cell lung cancer samples in a single-blind manner . we lysed the frozen tissues and performed the sh2-pla assay , western blotting , and far-western blotting  for comparison . in western and far-western, only one sample showed tyrosine phosphorylation at a band corresponding to egfr size . in the sh2-pla assay using  <dig>  μg of lysate per assay , we also observed a modest but significant signal  in the same sample confirming the presence of tyrosine phosphorylated egfr , even though its level of phosphorylation was significantly lower than that of a <dig> cell samples . this result indicates that sh2-pla is capable of detecting tyrosine phosphorylated sh <dig> domain recognition sites in weakly phosphorylated tumor tissues without requiring phosphopeptide enrichment.

discussion
in this study we developed sh2-pla, a novel in-solution sh <dig> domain binding assay, to analyze tyrosine phosphorylated egfr in egf-stimulated cells. the key feature of this assay is that binding of the sh <dig> domain probe to its cognate phosphorylated binding sites is monitored in solution using a combination of proximity ligation and quantitative pcr technologies. a positive signal requires the formation of a quaternary protein complex, namely a 5′ oligonucleotide-tagged anti-gst antibody , a gst-sh <dig> protein, tyrosine phosphorylated egfr, and a 3′ oligonucleotide-tagged anti-egfr antibody . we identified two stepwise protocols which yielded a suitable signal-to-noise profile: method  <dig>  pre-incubation of antibody probes to their respective targets  followed by sh <dig> binding; and method  <dig>  pre-incubation of the sh <dig> probe with egfr followed by antibody binding. for egf-stimulated a <dig> cells, we showed that a signal is detectable with as little as 2 ng lysate input per reaction and that the assay is able to detect specific interactions across three orders of magnitude of lysate input. to test the practical application, we conducted phosphorylation kinetics experiments of egf-stimulated cells and observed good agreement between sh2-pla and the established far-western assay. further we showed that sh2-pla unambiguously detected a relatively low level of egfr phosphorylation in lung cancer tissues using far less cell lysates than typically available from a core needle biopsy   <cit> . these data suggest that sh2-pla is a promising platform to rapidly determine sh <dig> domain binding sites in egf-stimulated cells or cancer tissues using a small amount of sample.

as with other immunoassays such as elisa and bead arrays, various types of sh <dig> and other modular domain binding assays in both solid- and solution-phase platforms have been described  <cit> . among those, pull down, far-western and their derivatives represent the most popular methods to assess sh <dig> domain binding sites on target proteins . in pull down assays, lysate is incubated with bead-bound sh <dig> domains for several hours, followed by western blotting with specific antibodies to the target protein. this assay requires a rigorous washing step and a negative control to minimize signal from non-specific binding and can be confounded by indirect binding via multi-protein complexes. in far-western blotting, only direct binding between the labeled sh <dig> domain and membrane-bound proteins is detected, though the identity of the band may need to be confirmed by immunoprecipitation or other methods. as a result of these multiple procedures, these assays are usually low throughput, requiring 100–1000 μg of protein and multiple days of assay runtime. in contrast, sh2-pla requires only a few microliters of lysate and 6– <dig> hours of assay time, making this assay highly flexible. although other high throughput systems, based on microarray or fluorescence polarization, are suitable for global mapping of sh <dig> domain binding sites using synthesized peptide libraries  <cit> , sh2-pla excels in the detection of sh <dig> binding to a specific target protein in whole cell lysate without requiring pre-purification or enrichment.

although the assay sensitivity is high, we observed a relatively modest linear range . it is currently unknown that whether this can be attributed to biochemical characteristics of assay components including buffer solutions, oligonucleotides, antibodies, gst-sh <dig> domains, and the stoichiometry of tyrosine phosphorylation sites on egfr. consistent with our observation , the linear range for the taqman protein assay system is reported to be 2– <dig> orders of magnitude when used to quantify protein expression  <cit> . the anti-egfr and gst antibodies used in this study when tested individually showed a lower linear range . in addition, the sh2-pla, designed to detect the formation of the quaternary protein complex, may also be affected by the transient nature of sh <dig> domain-ligand binding . thorsen et al. have reported a feasibility study correlating the mmp9:timp <dig> protein complex with breast cancer prognosis in which they validated the use of elisa and pla-based methods  <cit> . in this report, they obtained a linear signal range across approximately one order of magnitude in human plasma dilutions . taken together, multiple factors might result in the relatively narrow linear range seen in these protein-protein interaction assays employing in-solution proximity ligation assay. nevertheless, this issue can be partly addressed by calibration using software tools such as proteinassist  <cit>  . moreover, in many cases protein interaction assays are qualitative rather than quantitative in which the identification of positive interactions is the priority and high sensitivity and wide detection range, such as that observed in sh2-pla, is essential.

performance of sh2-pla could be improved by modifying the methodology. firstly, direct labeling of sh <dig> domains or the gst tag with oligonucleotides would reduce the assay complexity and could prevent issues stemming from insufficient gst:anti-gst antibody binding. further, if different sh <dig> domains are tagged with different oligonucleotides, it would allow for a multiplex pla reaction analogous to the previously described competitive reverse-phase sh <dig> profiling assay  <cit> . a potential problem with direct tagging is sh <dig> domain activity loss due to amino acid modification that would need to be assessed on a domain-by-domain basis. secondly, solid-phase pla could be considered. solid-phase pla uses an additional antibody which captures the target prior to dual recognition with 3′ and 5′ pla antibody probes  <cit> . solid-phase pla was reported to have a broader dynamic range compared to solution-phase pla  <cit> . owing to its additional washing steps, solid-phase pla is likely less affected by the presence of excess unbound pla probes and interfering substances in the buffer. 4-pla, a more elaborate variation of solid-phase pla, is another choice  <cit> . in 4-pla, a set of five antibodies consisting of one capture antibody and four oligonucleotide-bound antibodies are employed to attain simultaneous recognition of five epitopes on one or more target molecules. tavoosidana et al. applied 4-pla to quantification of prostasome microvesicles, a potential marker of prostate malignancies, in blood samples and showed superior performance over a conventional pla. a tempting application of this method would be a multiplex modular domain assay targeting multiple ptms on receptor tyrosine kinases such as egfr or pdgfr. receptor ptms could be monitored by a set of ptm-recognizing domains, e.g., sh <dig>  14-3- <dig>  etc., allowing for identification of exclusive or simultaneous modifications. the lower background of these solid phase platforms could benefit sh2-pla with improved overall sensitivity. however additional binding and washing steps will compromise the simplicity of the current sh2-pla method. more importantly, it remains to be determined if weak sh2-ptyr interactions would be detectable after a stringent wash.

in addition to the sh <dig> domain, we demonstrated that this pla-based methodology is a promising platform for the interrogation of other domain-based interactions. we showed that ptb and substrate-trapping ptp domains are capable of detecting egfr phosphorylation. although the sh <dig> domain is the most prevalent type of phosphotyrosine binding domain, integration of these other domains into the phosphorylation profiling is advantageous in that they allow for a larger coverage of tyrosine phosphorylation sites.

one obstacle to developing a customized sh2-pla method for phosphorylated proteins will be preparation of a positive control. the original taqman protein assay is designed to quantify protein expression, making a purified protein target the most suitable control for determining assay performance. however, in the case of the sh2-pla, a protein interaction assay assessing phosphorylation of a target protein, preparation of a suitable control is not a trivial task. for example, since sh <dig> domains may bind to a multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites on the target protein, an appropriate positive control suitable for spike-in experiments should be phosphorylated on all sh <dig> binding sites and contain the antibody binding motif. we sidestepped this issue by establishing tyrosine phosphorylation standards and quantifying the absolute amount of tyrosine phosphorylation in the given sample, thereby estimating the assay detection limit. while this approach is applicable to any tyrosine phosphorylated protein target, similar approaches could also be tailored for other domains recognizing post-translational modification sites on cellular proteins  <cit> . this feature as well as the universality of gst-tagging could allow sh2-pla to serve as a prototype for the development of powerful, convenient modular domain based proteomic tools  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed sh2-pla, an alternative in-solution homogenous sh <dig> domain binding assay based on proximity ligation and real-time pcr. using sh2-pegfr interactions as the assay target, we showed that sh2-pla has sufficient specificity, a very low limit of detection, a 1– <dig> order of magnitude linear range, and high reproducibility. in experiments with various egf-stimulated cells, we confirmed good agreement between sh2-pla and established far-western assay results. further, we found that sh2-pla is sensitive enough to detect the relatively low level of pegfr in lung cancer tissues without enrichment of ptyr-containing proteins. to our knowledge, this is the first report describing a microliter-scale assay for the detection of interaction between a recombinant sh <dig> domain probe and egfr in cell lysate. this method provides significant improvement over traditional protein interaction assays requiring large sample input. with the low sample requirement and short assay runtime, sh2-pla can provide a useful platform on which to develop high throughput modular domain binding assays applicable in both basic and translational cancer research.
