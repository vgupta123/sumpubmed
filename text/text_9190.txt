BACKGROUND
a key issue in functional genomics is to understand how genetic or epigenetic perturbations to cellular machinery result in disease. related to this is the question of how to perturb the system so that it functions in a desirable way. the first issue is the concern of hypothesis generation and the second is drug target discovery. much of the work in these areas is now done by human experts who mentally integrate experimental data reported in the literature and perhaps statistical summaries of data from a variety of sources. unfortunately, the number of papers published each year on any specific disease pathway continues to grow rapidly, making it difficult for specialists to incorporate all new results into their mental model of a pathway. furthermore, the amount of data becoming available through new measurement technologies is far greater than the human brain can adequately synthesize. a principal goal of systems biology is to devise computer algorithms to help with the task of integrating expert knowledge, largely gleaned through published results, with high throughput data sources to create new hypotheses and putative drug targets. a particularly vexing problem is that the amount of data available about any pathway is usually incomplete. the human mind is fortunately very good at reasoning with incomplete knowledge, which enables researchers to create new hypotheses even when only incomplete information is available. systems biology may benefit from emulating human reasoning: less detailed models that can incorporate many sources of incomplete information may yield more useful output  <cit> .

many engineering system designs today use descriptive models rather than mathematical models derived from mathematical formulas, such as differential equations. this is often achieved using a modeling approach based on fuzzy logic. fuzzy logic is a computational method for formulating and transferring human expert knowledge to computational models. it provides a flexible tool for modeling the relationship between input and output information and is distinguished by its robustness with respect to noise and variations in system parameters  <cit> . this characteristic seems to mirror the robustness of biological systems and their remarkable ability to achieve precise functional control from imprecise components  <cit> . fuzzy logic and several related, complementary software methodologies are sometimes lumped under the term 'soft computing' or hybrid intelligent systems. these represent a combination of emerging, complementary problem-solving technologies that include fuzzy logic, probabilistic reasoning, bayesian networks, neural networks, and evolutionary or genetic algorithms. models based on fuzzy logic are sometimes called rule-based models; these terms will be used interchangeably here.

fuzzy logic in medicine
fuzzy logic has become ubiquitous in modern control systems engineering, including medical applications  <cit> . it has been particularly useful in applications where appropriate mathematical models cannot be derived due to the complexity of the problem. examples include controlling the pump rate in artificial hearts and monitoring the hemodynamic state of patients during surgery  <cit> , prediction of gait events using the electromyographic  activity of lower extremity muscles in children with cerebral palsy  <cit> , pacemaker control  <cit> , anesthesia and ventilator control  <cit> , control of robotic prostheses  <cit> , and numerous other medical  <cit>  and engineering applications  <cit> . perhaps one of the most immediately attractive features of fuzzy logic modeling for biology is that it provides a straightforward method for formulating and transferring human expert knowledge to quantitative computer models. since much of the data about biological systems is derived from logically-designed, hypothesis-driven experiments and contained in linguistic form in journals, fuzzy logic provides a way for biologists to incorporate data that might otherwise be difficult to incorporate into computer models. often this data is noisy and imprecise. fuzzy logic models are naturally robust with respect to noise and variation in system parameters, but allow computation of logical consequences of complex system dynamics with imprecise variables.

at the same time, fuzzy logic models are capable of representing extremely complex systems to high degrees of accuracy when precise data is available. the standard additive model , a common formulation of a fuzzy logic system, is a universal approximator. that is, a sam can approximate any nonlinear function as precisely as desired, give appropriate data  <cit> . statistical and non-gradient based optimization methods such as genetic algorithms can be used to refine fuzzy logic models that are initially constructed by biologists manually or from pathway databases. estimation of distribution algorithms, a type of evolutionary algorithm that replaces mutation and crossover operations with probability distributions  <cit> , provide a potential way to use statistical high throughput data, such protein interaction data, to optimize manually constructed models or to provide putative hypotheses to fill in unknown network components. thus, the methodology presented here, which is primarily focused on using expert knowledge to build computational models, can use the aforementioned soft computing and statistical methods to incorporate other data sources to optimize parameters, making it an ideal data integration tool. since many textbooks and papers are available to describe fuzzy logic modeling details  <cit> , the discussion here will focus on a novel implementation of a fuzzy logic system embedded in a network structure and its usefulness for spanning research in basic biology and clinical research.

fuzzy logic and qualitative methods for systems biology
several related methods have been developed for fuzzy modeling of gene interaction networks from microarray data. the models are similar, but different methods are used to incorporate data and parameterize the models. woolf  <cit>  made fuzzy logic inference tables from triplets of genes to determine co-expression relationships. sokhansanj, et al.  <cit>  used an exhaustive search of gene interaction among twelve yeast cell cycle genes to fit the fuzzy model parameters. the model was able to predict transcriptional correlation among the twelve yeast cell cycle genes after tuning the model on a different data set for the same system. linden, et al.  <cit>  used a fuzzy logic model in a similar way to reverse engineer a gene interaction network from microarray data using genetic programming to discover and optimize the gene interaction rules. the goal of each of these models was to qualitatively represent coexpression patterns among genes.

our goal is a broader modeling paradigm than the previous fuzzy logic applications. more along the lines of our goal are efforts to use qualitative differential equations  to model biochemical dynamics in cells. thus far this work has been primarily used for metabolic pathways. a modeling system that requires time series of metabolite concentrations as input data is described by king, et al.  <cit> . they used a qde system to model ten reactions involved in glycolosis. two distinct modeling tasks are identified: simulation of a biochemical system when model parameters are known and system discovery from time series data. for system discovery, machine learning methods from the soft computing paradigm were used to parameterize the qdes. time series of concentrations for proteins of known structure were used as input data to build the model, which required considerable computational time on a beowulf cluster. one of the hindrances to adoption of this modeling approach is its computational representation that has evolved from the lisp programming language.

heuristic reasoning for hierarchical complex systems
the methodology presented in this paper is distinguished from previous qualitative modeling approaches in several ways. the initial goal was to develop a model that would allow experimental biologists to use the kind of qualitative data found in typical journal articles to describe the interaction of genes, proteins, and other cellular components to create computer models of large numbers of interacting parts. this arose from a practical need in our research to keep track of myriad components in pathway models that were built from data extracted from dozens of journal articles. biologists already do this kind of mental modeling every time they make a new hypothesis; a tool was needed to aid in this reasoning. secondly, with new sources of data becoming available, it was important to design a methodology that could be expanded in the future to integrate new data sources to refine models.

finally, biological processes span many scales. a kind of heuristic modeling is common in the literature, where molecular interactions are analyzed and used to create new hypotheses about cellular events, tissue processes or disease progression. for example, specific gene mutations accelerate tumor growth in specific tissues. this is a semi-quantitative relationship between two very different scales. fuzzy network modeling can be used as a tool for aiding human reasoning when many interacting variables participate in complex interaction networks on several scales. though the interactions can sometimes only be described approximately, the logic of the interactions is rigorous.

the modeling approach presented here was developed in an effort to create a computational tool that would emulate and extend the ability of human experts to create reasonable models from incomplete or ambiguous data. the goal was to allow these models to be constructed directly from the information contained in journal articles that typically report experimental results about molecular pathways. this approach adopts fuzzy logic for biochemical reaction modeling and all cellular processes and embeds this in a network structure. the network structure is similar to functional petri nets  <cit> , which are well-suited to representing molecular pathways and gene interactions, as well as physiological system interactions.

pathway models can be constructed manually by biologists and manipulated to study the dynamics of alternative pathways. however, the power of this method is that it provides a framework for using various soft computing technologies to integrate diverse data sources to improve and refine models. rule-based or fuzzy logic models  <cit>  are appropriate for manipulation by genetic or other evolutionary algorithms, which may be useful for drug target discovery. this process will be discussed in future papers that expand the basic model presented here. details about methods for integration of high-throughput data with expert knowledge will also be reserved for future publications. because the soft computing paradigm has been widely adopted for many engineering tasks, it is hoped that the framework presented here can be adopted and rapidly expanded by many researchers with expertise in these methods. input files and code for all examples presented are available at the bionet website  <cit> .

RESULTS
the most common childhood brain cancer is medulloblastoma , a devastating disease that can result in permanent serious brain damage even when successfully treated  <cit> . the etiology of mb is believed to involve aberrant activation of sonic hedgehog  signalling  <cit> . potential therapeutic targets are therefore regulators of the hedgehog pathway  <cit> . although much remains to be learned about the transcriptional hierarchy involved in hedgehog activation, enough experimental data is available to construct pathway models that are quite complex. hedgehog regulation of medulloblastomas will be used as an example to illustrate our modeling approach.

a model of hedgehog regulation of tumor growth will be constructed hierarchically, starting with a few molecular components and their role in tumor growth. figure  <dig> presents the major hedgehog components that control "tumor growth". tumor growth is a tissue-level quantity is regulated by a hierarchy of steps starting with shh expression and hedgehog activation. initially, we are interested in identifying the common network features or motifs that are involved in this system and building an extensible model that captures our understanding of the processes involved. the rules used to build this model are shown beside the figure. there are  <dig> nodes in this model and  <dig> reactions. reactions for most variables include production and decay. shh does not have production or decay reactions; it is set either to either its lowest or highest value in simulations. specific motifs within this pathway will now be isolated and discussed for their relevance to the model. the rules for each of these cases are the same is for the whole pathway, except that lightly shaded parts are set to constant values.

shh binds to the tumor repression gene patched , releasing its suppression of smoothened , which activates gli transcription factors. the gli transcription factors are the primary effectors of shh signalling in the developing cerebellum  <cit> . of particular interest is regulation of the gli family of transcription factors that are believed to be involved in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis  <cit> . several promising cancer drugs that reduce medulloblastoma growth in mouse models purportedly interfere with gli <dig> and gli <dig> expression by blocking the signalling pathway downstream of smo. these include hhantag  <cit>  and cyclopamines  <cit> . a target of gli <dig> is ptc1; ptc <dig> is a transmembrane protein that blocks smo expression when shh binds to it. gli <dig> activates ptc <dig> expression and thus counters, to some extent shh repression of ptc <dig> activity  <cit> . the feedback from gli <dig> to ptc <dig> that is active in normal cells, as illustrated by figure  <dig>  may play an important role in determining the effectiveness of drugs that regulate gli <dig> expression downstream of smo. some reports suggest that this feedback loop may be inactivated in medulloblastomas in vivo, but not in cultured cells  <cit> .

basic fuzzy network modeling concepts
we define a dynamic, interacting system by specifying the all of the variables that participate in the system and the processes  in which each node participates. the participating variables, also called nodes as in graph theory or petri nets, can represent protein concentrations, gene expression levels, tumor size, temperature or any other variable of interest, including discrete variables.

reactions or processes define dynamic changes to node values and must involve one or more nodes as reactants. though the language used leans toward biochemical reactions, a useful feature of this rule-based model is the ability to connect dynamics on multiple scales. nodes can represent any quantity for which rules of change can be defined. a reaction is defined by a reaction rate constant and a list of participating nodes together with their role in the reaction. the rate constant is a scaling factor that multiplies the reaction rate that is determined by changing reactant values. reactions can also be defined as discrete events. reaction rate has no meaning in this case; the event happens when the reactants satisfy the rule for firing and nothing happens when those conditions are not satisfied. this is useful for modeling processes such as chromosome separation or cytokinesis. discrete events may also be a useful model for representing complex processes like metastasis as a single event that follows a long series of cellular reactions and sets into motion other processes.

for each reaction shown, the reactants have default rules based on their role as substrate, product, activator or inhibitor. these default rules can be overridden by giving new rules explicitly, as will be described in the methods section or may be optimized using automatic methods to integrate other data sources. the latter will not be discussed in detail here. a diagram of a system as in figure  <dig> is used to construct a computer model by first listing all of the participating nodes. each reaction is then listed, with a reaction rate. substrates are variables that are used up in a reaction; products are produced. activators and inhibitors participate in a reaction, but their value doesn't change. the default rules for each of these roles are as follows:

• when a substrate is absent, the reaction rate is zero. as the concentration of substrate increases, the reaction rate increases proportionately. thus, if the substrate level is low, its contribution to the reaction rate is low. the reaction rate, multiplied by the rate scaling factor or rate constant, determines how fast the substrate is used up in that reaction. by default, substrates have a stoichiometry of - <dig>  this can be changed manually as needed.

• a product is produced in a reaction. it does not affect the reaction rate, except that when the product concentration reaches its highest allowable amount the reaction rate goes to zero. no more can be produced. the default stoichiometry is + <dig> 

• activators have the same default rules as a substrate: as the concentration increases, the reaction rate contribution increases. activator concentration is not changed by a reaction in which it participates as an activator, it only influences the rate. activators and inhibitors have a stoichiometry of  <dig>  indicating that the reaction does not change their concentration.

• an inhibitor causes a reaction rate to slow as its concentration increases. when absent, an inhibitor has no effect on a reaction rate, which is then wholly determined by the concentrations of substrates and activators. as the amount of inhibitor increases, the reaction rate slows. the concentration at which an activator or inhibitor strongly affects a reaction rate can be set when known. by default, the effect is proportionate to the enzyme concentration.

in each reaction, the contributions of all participating reactants are averaged using one of several averaging schemes. we found that either a harmonic average or minimum rule works best. both of these have the property that if the rule for any reactant makes the rate zero, the rate will be zero. thus, if a reaction includes two substrates and an activator where the concentration of one substrate is zero, but the activator and the other substrate concentration are high, the output rule is zero: the reaction rate should be zero because one of the substrates is absent.

in rule-based simulations the meaning of "low" and "high" are determined by the dynamic range or universe of discourse for each variable. in the hedgehog model, most variables have a concentration range of  for simplicity in illustrating the dynamics of particular motifs. however, the dynamic range of shh is defined to be  in this model. this was set to illustrate that variables can be assigned values in any desired range. rules are defined based on the meaning of "low" and "high" within the context of the appropriate range for a given variable. thus, a concentration of  <dig>  is high for shh in this model, while  <dig>  is low for gli <dig>  in addition, the meaning of "low" and "high" for a given variable can be different in different reactions. thus, in reactions where gli <dig> is a product, such as a transcription reaction, low, medium and high on a scale of  <dig> to  <dig> might be represented by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . in a catalytic reaction where gli <dig> is a potent non-stoichiometric activator, a concentration of  <dig>  might be "high" in that it causes the reaction to achieve its maximum rate. this information can be put into the model rules if available. if not, model simulations can still be run using whatever information is available.

common motifs
positive and negative feedback
feedback motifs are common in biological systems  <cit> . negative feedback loops are essential for maintaining equilibrium and resisting change while positive feedback structures amplify signals to enable switch-like behaviour  <cit> . gli <dig> is a transcription factor that promotes transcription of ptc <dig>  <cit> . figure  <dig> highlights the gli <dig> feedback loop in the hedgehog pathway. nmycp and the transforming event required for tumor growth are constitutively "on" in figure  <dig> simulations in order to isolate the effects of gli <dig> feedback on ptc <dig> and tumor growth. when shh signalling is active, ptc <dig> is repressed, causing increased gli <dig> expression. when the gli <dig> feedback loop is active, as in figure  <dig> a, the system is self-regulating and tends toward an equilibrium level of ptc <dig>  smo and gli <dig>  as increased ptc <dig> expression tends to upregulate gli <dig> even in the presence of shh  <cit> . when the feedback loop is broken, as in figure  <dig> b, shh signalling causes rapid suppression of ptc <dig> to low levels and growth of smo and gli <dig> to high levels. disconnecting the feedback loop is accomplished in the model by simply removing gli <dig> as a reactant from the production reaction for ptc <dig> .

feedforward motif
cells have a remarkable ability to orchestrate precise sequences of events using imprecise components. an important mechanism for accomplishing this feat is to filter out some signals and respond to others. a feedforward motif can filter the effects of transient signals while allowing sustained signals to activate downstream components  <cit> . figure  <dig> isolates a feedforward motif in the hedgehog pathway. to isolate the dynamics of the feedforward motif, the transforming event was constitutively "on" and the gli <dig> feedback loop to ptc <dig> was deleted. shh production was on for one-half day at the start of day  <dig>  and then turned off. though nmycp responded quickly to this transient signal, it was not sufficient to activate gli <dig> transcription. on day  <dig> a longer shh signal was turned on. gli <dig> transcription began approximately one day after gli <dig> production began. tumor growth begins when gli <dig> reaches a moderately high level. when shh transcription ends, nmycp levels begin to drop immediately, but gli <dig> decline is delayed. thus, a series of prolonged aberrant shh activation events could sustain tumor growth. note that times and rates in this example were implemented to illustrate modeling concepts and, though physiologically reasonable, may not be accurate.

the feedforward system in figure  <dig> offers a potential explanation for the occurrence of medulloblastoma in haploinsufficient ptc+/- mice. approximately 14–20% of heterozygous ptc+/- mice develop medulloblastoma tumors, whereas these tumors are rare in ptc+/+ mice  <cit> . lower production of ptc <dig> in heterozygous mice may make the probability that a perturbation to the hedgehog pathway will result in decreased ptc <dig> expression for a long enough time to allow tumor growth to initiate. transient shh upregulation, as seen in the simulation, is not sufficient to allow sufficient gli <dig> increase if ptc <dig> production is high.

single input motif 
in a related manner, temporal coordination of developmental processes can be achieved by differential response to a common signal  <cit> . single input motifs involve activation of several parallel pathways by a single activator  <cit> . in figure  <dig>  shh activates three separate pathways. each of these parallel pathways is required for tumor growth and each has a different activation threshold, decay threshold and rate. the rules for this simulation are as for the basic model in figure  <dig>  with the gli <dig> feedback loop deleted to illustrate this motif. the simulation curves have the same shape and characteristic response profile as the differential equation simulations in  <cit> , demonstrating that intuitive rules define the correct dynamic behaviour.

chemical reaction kinetics
although analytical equations are known for basic reaction kinetics and approximations for enzyme-catalyzed reactions, it is desirable to use simple rules to describe such reactions when the goal is to integrate these with other processes for which analytical equations are not known. a number of software packages are available for modeling reaction dynamics with differential equations and can be found, for example, on the systems biology workbench site  <cit> . generic numerical software that might also be suitable can be found in a number of places, including the netlib numerical software library  <cit> . rule-based representations of chemical reactions are relatively simple to write and easily modified, which is useful when exploring the system effects of different possible reactions through simulation.

because of the universal approximation properties of fuzzy logic models, they are able to represent any nonlinear process as accurately as desired, given sufficient data. it may be easier to make very precise chemical reaction models with differential equations, but robust system models that integrate many levels, from approximate cellular chemistry to clinical data, may be more useful for some medical research and more easily constructed with linguistic rules by biologists and clinicians without numerical modeling experience.

rules to determine reaction rates from substrate concentrations can be determined in a variety of ways. the mathematical details for fuzzy logic rules most appropriate for modeling chemical kinetics remain to be derived. for modeling biological systems, simplicity with reasonable accuracy is a high priority. a second order reaction and an enzyme catalyzed reaction, both involving activation of smo by ptc <dig>  are implemented with fuzzy rules and examined here.

an essential part of hedgehog pathway activation involves release of ptc <dig> repression of smo. smo activates downstream transcription factors of the gli family, which in turn upregulate cell cycle components  <cit> . one model suggests that smo is in a balance between active and inactive states. smo is activated when it combines stoichiometrically with a small molecule  that changes its conformation. the small molecule must be actively transported across the cell membrane by ptc <dig>  which acts catalytically.

the model in figure  <dig> is simulated with the following rules, with only three essential reactions. for each reaction, take the harmonic mean of substrate concentrations ; then reaction rate is . the three reactions are: reaction 1: smo_inactive and sm are substrates and active smo is the product. the rate coefficient is  <dig> e- <dig> s- <dig>  reaction 2: the reverse reaction, has one substrate, activated smo-sm complex, and two products, with the rate coefficient  <dig> e- <dig> s- <dig>  reaction 3: the sm is transported across the membrane at a rate much faster than it is used by smo and is continually supplied at a constant rate that is catalyzed by ptc <dig> 

to analyze the system dynamics of the hedgehog pathway, it may be sufficient to model the catalytic nature of ptc <dig> action heuristically using rules that capture the nonlinear effects of ptc <dig> on smo: if ptc <dig> is zero, smo activation is at its normal or highest level, vmax. when a small amount of ptc <dig> is present, smo concentration is only 20% of its highest level . if ptc <dig> is higher than that, the equilibrium concentration of active smo goes to near zero. normally, the linguistic terms zero, very low, low, medium, high and very high are assumed to mean fractions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , respectively, of the maximum possible value. these are used as defaults for all rules. however, these can be adjusted when more information is available. in figure  <dig>  ptc <dig> catalyzes smo inactivation. it was reported that a concentration of ptc <dig> of 1/ <dig> the concentration of smo reduces the level of active smo by 80%  <cit> . the meaning of very low, low and medium we set at  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  for ptc <dig> when it acts enzymatically to deactivate smo. the rule for this reaction was: the inactivation rate is zero when ptc <dig> is zero or very low and very high when ptc <dig> is low or higher. the curve for equilibrium smo versus ptc <dig> concentration in figure  <dig> b shows the typical s-shape for an enzymatic reaction, with the greatest change in rate occurring for ptc <dig> concentration of "low", the value at which the rate goes from zero to very high.

it is important to emphasize that the goal here is not just to show that fuzzy rules can be found to match differential equation models of chemical kinetics. rather, a model based on intuitively reasonable rules that describe the reaction qualitatively produce reaction dynamics that are very close to dynamics derived from chemical kinetics using rigorous mathematical derivations.

oscillators, switches and discrete events in the cell cycle
cell cycle machinery plays a central role in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell fate determination. failure to exit the cell cycle at the correct time may cause abnormal development and aberrant re-entry into the cell cycle by terminally differentiated cells may be a primary cause of many cancers. understanding regulation of the cell cycle is therefore a central issue in the application of molecular biology to medicine. for that reason, a number of differential equation models of the cell cycle in yeast have been constructed for research purposes  <cit> . regulation of the mammalian cell cycle is more complex than that of yeast, though many homologous genes and proteins and common network motifs are involved.

a model of the mammalian cell cycle was constructed with several important components. chromosome separation and cell division were included as discrete events that occur when certain conditions are met. the cell cycle is an oscillatory system that involves not only continuous processes, but a series of discrete events  <cit> . discrete events are an important mechanism in cells for controlling the precise timing of key events and insuring irreversibility with imprecise components  <cit> . thus, even though many cell cycle parameters are poorly constrained, the overall behaviour of the cell cycle system is well characterized and heuristic modeling approaches are suitable for studying the control dynamics or testing possible ideas for new drug targets  <cit> .

tumor growth is linked to this cell cycle via cell division. tumor size in this case is a measure of the number of cell divisions that have occurred. if the cell cycle arrests, tumor size shrinks slowly through a continuous apoptotic reaction. rules for this cell cycle model are as follows:

 <dig>  cyclind <dig> production is continuous

 <dig>  cyclind <dig> decay is proportional to cyclind <dig> and apc levels and is rapid

 <dig>  cyclinb production is proportional to cyclind <dig> level

 <dig>  cyclinb decay is zero when apc is less than high, is low when apc is high, and is very high when apc is very high.

 <dig>  cdc <dig> production is proportional to cyclinb levels

 <dig>  cdc <dig> decay is continuous and proportional to cdc <dig> concentration

 <dig>  apc production is proportional to cdc <dig> level, but is zero when cdc <dig> is very low and low.

 <dig>  apc decay is directly proportional to cyclinb, cell mass and entry into g1sg <dig> and determined by the harmonic average of these.

 <dig>  chromosome separation event occurs when cyclind <dig> is medium or higher and g1sg <dig> is in the on state . g1sg <dig> turns off when chromosome separation occurs.

 <dig>  cell division occurs when cyclinb is low or less and decreasing at any rate; chromosome separation event must also have occurred. g1sg <dig> turns on when cell division occurs and chromosome separation turns off.

 <dig>  cell division turns off when cell mass is very low or less and cell division is currently on.

 <dig>  cell mass growth is constant. when cell division occurs , cell mass is halved. cell mass has a range of values between one and two.

the growth rate of cell mass has a controlling effect on the rest of the cycle. it was set to make the cycle length approximately  <dig> day, a typical value for human cells undergoing mitosis  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows time courses for molecular components and events in the cell cycle model, as well as tumor growth. the shape and ordering of curves for cyclinb, cdc <dig> and apc are very similar here to those shown in tyson's cell cycle model  <cit> . chromosome separation is a discrete event that is on for a brief time at the beginning of mitosis and then turns off when cell division occurs. another discrete event, cell division, is not shown here. if either of these events does not occur , the cell cycle halts. similarly, knocking out any of the critical components of this pathway, cyclind <dig>  cyclinb, cdc <dig> or apc, for example by deleting their production reaction, will also cause the cycle to halt. in figure  <dig> b the cell cycle was set to stop suddenly on day  <dig>  when this happens, tumor growth, a measure of the number of cell divisions that have occurred, stops and the tumor slowly decays through the apoptotic reaction. the latter is a simple reaction with tumor size as the sole participant .

modeling and drug target discovery
computational models are potentially very useful for exploring the effects of manipulating complex pathways through drugs or other means. rule based models of two features that make them promising tools for drug target discovery. first, it is easy for experts to use their domain knowledge to build models. rules can be changed easily without mathematical manipulations to carry out thought experiments with many hundreds or thousands of components. secondly, algorithms for automatically manipulating fuzzy rules have been developed for a variety of engineering applications and include genetic algorithms and neural nets. it may be possible for experts to build first-stage models of pathways and then apply computational methods to optimize the models using other data sources, or to search for optimal drug targets.

to illustrate the use of the model for carrying out computational experiments a rule-based model was constructed using elements of the previously presented pathways. our goal in this example is to explore the effects of a drug, hhantag, that reportedly interferes with gli <dig> activation of cyclind <dig>  thereby stopping progression of the cell cycle  <cit> . hhantag was introduced as a new component to the model in figure  <dig>  hhantag inhibits both gli <dig> and, to a lesser extent, gli <dig> expression downstream of smo.

an interesting reported effect of hhantag on cultured neural tissues is that a relatively low dose suppresses gli <dig> levels, but a thousand fold increase is needed to halt tumor growth  <cit> . this effect is not observed in vivo. an important key to this difference is the suggestion that the feedback loop from gli <dig> to ptc <dig> is operates in the cultured system but not in vivo. as discussed previously, ptc <dig> acts catalytically on smo expression: very low levels of ptc <dig> are sufficient to significantly reduce smo activity  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  when the gli <dig> feedback loop to ptc <dig> is active small doses of drug are sufficient to suppress tumor growth . without this feedback, the drug is not as effective in low doses. only at much higher doses can the drug suppress both gli proteins sufficiently to stop tumor growth .

it should be emphasized here that the hedgehog pathway is not well understood and the model presented here is in preliminary stages. nevertheless, it illustrates important modeling ideas. the next step is to replace the tumor growth module with a cell cycle model. first, we develop and test a preliminary cell cycle model using rules. this will then be connected to the hedgehog pathway.

a more complete model for hedgehog regulation of the cell cycle is shown in figure  <dig>  the cell cycle model discussed previously has been combined with the components in figure  <dig>  integration of these rule-based models was simple and required little more than pasting the rule files for each into one file and modifying the reactions for cyclind <dig> so that gli <dig> and gli <dig> regulated its production. in this model, shh directly induces nmyc expression and indirectly affects nmyc posttranslational modification, mediated by its indirect targets, cyclinb and possibly other cyclins  <cit> . shh also binds to ptc <dig>  as described previously, activating gli expression. the tumor growth process from figure  <dig> is now replaced by the cell cycle model from of figure  <dig>  note that a circular pathway exists among activated cyclinb, nmyc and its phosphorylated form nmycp, and cyclind <dig>  an additional component or transforming event, mentioned in figure  <dig>  is needed to start this cycle, which reinforces the suggestion that another yet unknown target may also be required for cell transformation  <cit> .

once started, the cycle will continue as long as the shh pathway remains active. mitotic degradation of nmyc permits neuronal precursor cell cycle exit in the absence of shh signalling or in the case of an intrinsic program-directed shift toward differentiation. thus neural fate specification and cancer activation are regulated by the same machinery.

in figure  <dig> b simulation time courses show the effect of decreasing insulin growth factor  on the cell cycle. in this figure, igf is decreased beginning on day  <dig>  allowing gsk-3β to increase. nmyc-p is then phosphorylated and degraded. note that nmyc-p initially decreases, and then recovers for one cell cycle through complicated feedbacks. incorporating as many of these complicated interactions into a model is essential for identifying potential drug targets, as cells are remarkably robust and have built-in fault tolerance systems that may not be evident from examination of static network or interaction diagrams  <cit> . the effects of drug dose will be the same for this model as in figure  <dig>  as the primary action of the drug on gli <dig> has not been changed. however, adding details to the cell cycle now allows more detailed investigation of the interaction between the drug, its targets, and cell cycle components.

CONCLUSIONS
an important goal of computational modeling of biochemical networks is to identify potential drug targets in silico. computational tools that can enhance the ability of researchers to reason through the complex dynamics of pathways of interest may be useful for researchers trying to keep track of dozens or hundreds of interacting network components, while automatic methods for manipulating pathway models to search for drug targets have the potential to revolutionize the drug development process  <cit> .

integrating the rapidly growing quantities of high throughput data into meaningful pathway information is a bottleneck to computational drug screening and discovery  <cit> . although informatics tools are currently being used to identify potential pathway interactions and putative targets, target identification necessarily requires detailed understanding of the structure of the pathway and the role of specific genes and proteins. this information is generally available in journal articles as linguistic pathway descriptions or interactions derived from hypothesis-driven experiments  <cit> .

a major advantage of the modeling approach presented here is that it enables the incorporation of biological expertise into the modeling process. at the same time, it does not prevent integration of multiple high throughput data sources into the model. new evolutionary algorithms based on statistical estimation, called estimation of distribution algorithms  <cit> , enable bayesian probability distributions to be used as input data to optimize system parameters. such statistical data is commonly available from bioinformatics analyses of microarray expression data  or proteomics data  <cit> . the framework presented by the fuzzy logic model presented here thus allows representation of expert knowledge about a pathway, and integration of other sources of numerical data with that data. further research into efficient algorithms for integration of data from many sources is an important area for further research.

drug discovery is a difficult challenge for computational and systems biology. finding a "clever way to throw away the details may be the most important part of model building"  <cit> . intelligent hybrid systems are an important method for modeling dynamic networks and complex biological processes with linguistic or qualitative-logical data, while allowing for more accurate models as more data becomes available.

the initial motivation of this modeling approach was to shift the burden of modeling to biological description and biological data. we deliberately sought to develop a modeling paradigm that imitates the logical reasoning that biologists use when analyzing a complex pathway diagram to understand its function and develop new hypotheses to explain observations.

another motivation for this work, which will be developed and explicated in future publications, was to find a quantitative representation of biological systems that was simple enough to be manipulated by genetic algorithms as a possible approach to computational drug target discovery and for integration of multiple data sources. such a program will likely be similar to current engineering approaches to fuzzy system discovery  <cit>  and will be a subject for future research.
