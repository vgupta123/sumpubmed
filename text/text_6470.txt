BACKGROUND
comparative genomics has revealed that approximately 5% of the mammalian genome is under purifying selection  <cit> . while exons make up roughly  <dig> % of the genome  <cit> , relatively little is known about the role of the remaining  <dig> % of the highly conserved genomic regions, and even less about the functional potential of evolutionarily-diverged intergenic sequences. large-scale microarray tiling analyses , as well as high-throughput cdna sequencing efforts, have indicated that the "transcriptome" is significantly larger than was previously appreciated, although the functional significance of the vast majority of the novel, apparently noncoding  transcripts detected by these approaches has remained elusive  <cit> . to date, several studies have reported large-scale tiling efforts of the human genome  <cit> . in all cases a significantly higher proportion of transcribed sequence was reported than could be accounted for by existing exon annotation data, and much of the remainder did not appear to encode protein  <cit> . comparison of datasets suggests that a high proportion of the novel transcripts are specific to tissues or cell lines  <cit> . this trend was particularly evident for cell lines, where novel cell-line specific transcripts were even more numerous than annotated cell-line specific exons  <cit> , implying that many of these transcripts may not have endogenous functions in whole organisms. further supporting this possibility was the observation that the majority of the novel transcripts were detected at very low levels  <cit> .

a second source of evidence for a more extensive transcriptome arises from large-scale cdna compilation efforts. the mouse cdna sequencing effort led by the riken consortium identified  <dig>  unique cdna transcripts from a variety of mouse tissues and cell lines  <cit> . approximately half  were derived from unique genomic locations , of which  <dig>  did not map to known or predicted coding genes in mouse  <cit> . further refinement identified a set of  <dig>  mrna-like noncoding rnas which had no homology to any known protein sequences and comprised of sequences mapped to regions located between predicted exon boundaries  <cit> . many of these sequences were reported elsewhere in est databases and displayed features of polymerase ii transcripts  <cit> . however, unlike protein-coding mouse genes, of which 99% have homologs in the human genome  <cit> , only  <dig> % of the  <dig>  apparent nc transcripts were represented by homologous sequences in the human genome  <cit> . in fact, wang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that most of these transcripts are no more conserved than intergenic sequence in general, and less conserved than a comprehensive set of  <dig> known ncrnas with established functional roles. in addition, expression profiling of a different but overlapping  subset of cdnas that do not map to known ests or protein sequences , revealed that most transcripts in this uncharacterized class were present at low abundance  <cit> . collectively, these results demonstrate the transcription of uncharacterized sequence, but raise questions about the functional relevance of the novel "noncoding" set.

one possible explanation for the observed low-level expression of a much larger fraction of genomes than can be accounted for by known genes comes from the recent discovery of a nuclear posttranscriptional quality-control pathway that degrades "cryptic unstable transcripts"  in yeast  <cit> . cuts are transcribed by pol ii and are detectable by both microarrays and rt-pcr in wild-type yeast, and also appear to be frequently represented as single tags in sage libraries, but are undetectable by northern blotting and do not contain significant open reading frames. however, in mutants in the quality-control pathway, they appear as a smear on northern blots due to the fact that they have heterogeneous 3' ends  <cit> . the fact that a posttranscriptional quality control exists to prevent accumulation of cuts suggests that they are aberrant and predicts that there should be little selection pressure on their expression. moreover, these observations suggest that nonfunctional transcripts might be distinguished from bona fide functional transcripts on the basis of formation of a discrete species on northern blotting, and by conservation of expression among different organisms.

in this study, we describe a systematic approach to predict and screen novel ncrna transcripts in the mouse genome. we first identified non-exonic sequences that are most likely to encode functional ncrnas  by using the program qrna, which searches for conserved regions with compensatory mutation patterns that are consistent with the evolutionary conservation of secondary structure in functional noncoding sequences  <cit> . these are hallmarks of most known functional ncrnas, and qrna has been used successfully to identify novel structural ncrnas in e. coli  <cit>  and s. cerevisiae  <cit> . however, even in these organisms, which have relatively compact genomes, a high false-positive prediction rate was observed  <cit> , which presents a challenge for screening large genomes. we therefore used a custom oligonucleotide microarray  <cit>  as an initial high-throughput screen for expression. we then tested the  <dig> highest-expressed candidates to ask whether they are detectable as discrete species on northern blots. we report eight novel mouse transcripts identified using this approach. however, none of the eight appears to be expressed in humans, casting doubt on their role as independent functional elements. taken together with the low proportion of intergenic sequences that we detected, our results suggest that much of the recently-discovered expanded transcriptome  <cit>  may correspond to cryptic transcripts  <cit> , suggesting a limited role for transcribed intergenic and intronic sequences as independent functional elements.

RESULTS
predicting novel ncrna candidates
we identified novel structural ncrna candidates on the basis of two features: high sequence conservation and a mutation pattern consistent with sequences being under selective pressure to maintain a conserved secondary structure . figure  <dig> outlines the computational screen we employed for finding novel ncrnas. we obtained human-mouse pairwise sequence alignments from ucsc  <cit>  and subset them to alignments with a minimum of 85% sequence identity using a  <dig> nt scanning window. this eliminated sequences that are unlikely to be under evolutionary selection  <cit>  and reduced the dataset to a computationally manageable size. we used qrna v. <dig>   <cit>  to screen the alignments for putative ncrnas. this generated  <dig>  predicted ncrnas. we then removed redundant sequences and predicted ncrnas with sequences similar or identical to coding genes annotated in the mouse refseq mrna database  <cit> , riken cdna  <cit> , mouse protein nr database  <cit> , or coding genes in other organisms annotated in genbank  <cit> . the remaining  <dig>  predicted ncrnas were sorted by logistic regression using four parameters that we identified to be useful for distinguishing known ncrnas from qrna predictions of putative new ncrnas: 1) the qrna logodds rna score; 2) the thermodynamic stability of the predicted secondary structure of each prediction; 3) a genomic clustering score of closely mapped predictions on the genome ; and 4) an overlap between mouse-human and mouse-rat qrna predictions . the qrna score was the strongest indicator of defined ncrnas , but combining the additional parameters increased the sorting power, especially for the top 10% of the predicted rnas . other parameters such as gc content and length of the sequences did not improve the sorting . to further characterize the set of predicted ncrnas, we screened them computationally for trnas and snornas  <cit>  and searched for similar sequences in the riken fantom <dig> mrna-like ncrna collection. for a summary of these features, see additional file  <dig> 

array design
due to the generic nature of the algorithm, qrna has a high false positive rate, much higher than coding gene-finding algorithms, thus experimental validation is essential. using the prediction scheme and sorting criteria described above, we designed a microarray to detect  <dig>  qrna predictions with properties most indicative of ncrnas. the microarray contained probes for the top  <dig> % of the total ncrna predictions, and probes for  <dig> known ncrnas . the design included  <dig>  complementary dna probes to the qrna predictions ,  <dig> random probe sequences and  <dig> intergenic probes that served as negative controls, and  <dig> positive control probes tiled across u <dig>  u <dig> and mature rrna transcripts. a list of all microarray probes is included in additional file  <dig> 

analysis of rna from diverse mouse tissues
since ncrnas can be expressed in a tissue-or developmental-stage-specific manner  <cit>  we screened  <dig> mouse tissues/organs encompassing a variety of tissue sources, including two embryonic stages of development . the intensity distribution over all measurements is shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, the majority of qrna-prediction intensity measurements overlapped with the negative control probe measurements, presumably due to the high false-positive rate inherent in generating the predictions. however, the distribution was skewed to the right tail of the plot , and twice as many of measurements from the predicted ncrnas were above the 99% negative control threshold  than would be expected based on a random distribution . of the  <dig> known ncrnas that were among the qrna predicted rnas , we detected  <dig>  including several snornas, trnas, a hox antisense transcript, and mirnas, using the same intensity cutoff used for selecting novel candidates . this illustrates that the sensitivity of this technique is sufficient to detect most known ncrna types. we have also used this technique to survey mirna expression  <cit> .

validation by northern blotting
although our microarray data indicated that many of the measurements arise from real transcripts, noise  could also account for some proportion of the high-intensity measurements. furthermore, microarray results cannot differentiate between a single rna species and a heterogeneous population. we therefore used northern blotting to validate our candidate novel ncrnas. northern blotting is more quantitative than rt-pcr, since there is no exponential amplification step. it is less sensitive for the same reason; however, using our methods, we have been able to detect all types of transcripts including structural ncrnas, mirnas, and mrnas . importantly, since northern blotting reveals the size of the rna species detected, it can distinguish whether there is a single rna product species and a heterogeneous transcript population. we tested all predicted ncrnas detected by at least two of three probes  displaying signals above the 99%-negative control intensity threshold in at least one tissue. in total, this included  <dig> novel predicted ncrnas, of which most appeared to be ubiquitously expressed. northern analysis on this subset confirmed  <dig> novel transcripts , all of which were detected ubiquitously in total rna isolated from  <dig> wild-type mouse tissues. all eight transcripts were between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length, none had trna or snorna structural or sequence characteristics, and five were located in intronic regions. it is possible that additional rnas are expressed at low levels that are detectable by microarray and/or rt-pcr but not by northern blotting, especially if they are heterogeneous in length  <cit> . we did not pursue this possibility, since it seemed that transcripts undetectable by northern blotting are less likely to represent bona fide ncrnas.

expression of novel mouse transcripts is not conserved in human cells/tissues
nearly all sequence-conserved coding genes between human and mouse have a conserved expression pattern across multiple tissues  <cit> . although they have not to our knowledge been comprehensively analyzed, ncrnas are also generally expressed similarly across related species  <cit>  and since most are required for cell proliferation, they tend to be expressed in all tissues, as were all eight of the novel transcripts we observed. however, northern blotting revealed that none of the eight novel mouse transcripts were expressed at detectable levels in hela cells or in human tissues . moreover, only five of these were detected in rat . images of all full-scale northern blots shown in figure  <dig> and other supporting northern data is available in the supplementary data .

we also compared our  <dig>  qrna predictions and the rnas we verified with recently published high-density human tiling data from cheng et al.  <cit> . we subset our qrna predictions to regions surveyed by cheng et al.  <cit>  . we considered the "transfrags"  described by cheng et al.  <cit>  in poly-a-minus rna from hepg <dig> cells, which should be most comparable to our data . we confirmed that the cheng et al.  <cit>  "transfrags" encompassed a larger number of known noncoding rnas and mrna exons than was obtained from random positioning of sequences of the same length , although the vast majority of "transfrags" do not overlap any annotated features. we did not see a marked difference in the overlap between the cheng et al. "transfrags" and our qrna predictions . this indicates that the "transfrags" are not enriched for conserved sequence with conserved secondary structure, consistent with our data showing a lack of conserved expression of our northern-confirmed qrna transcripts in human tissues and cells. only one of the eight northern-confirmed novel mouse transcripts we verified mapped to the regions surveyed by cheng et al.  <cit>  and it did not overlap a "transfrag", also consistent with our results .

discussion
using comparative genomics and an established ncrna search method modified for high-throughput screening, we report eight novel mouse ncrna transcripts that are all relatively short, ubiquitously expressed, and abundant. despite their sequence and secondary structure conservation, none of the transcripts were expressed at detectable levels in human cells and tissues.

given the large search space incorporated in this analysis, our results indicate that little intergenic or intronic sequence is expressed as distinct, stable transcripts at levels comparable to the expression of most known functional rnas. this deduction contrasts somewhat with the conclusions of recent studies employing tiling arrays or large-scale cdna sequencing  <cit> . because results from other studies were obtained and validated in different ways, we cannot confirm or refute the basic observations of any other study. numerous explanations exist for the breadth of the emerging transcriptome  <cit> . nonetheless, we propose that claims regarding a dramatically larger transcriptome than is accounted for by current annotations should be addressed with scrutiny, particularly with regard to functional potential. several factors indicate that a significant proportion of the newly measured transcripts may either be spurious or non-functional: 1) transcriptionally active regions identified in tiling analyses and potentially noncoding cdnas are generally detected in low abundance  <cit> ; 2) in yeast, many intergenic regions are also transcribed at low levels, apparently as heterogeneous species, and there is a specific mechanism for degrading these transcripts  <cit> ; 3) much of the mammalian data available is from cell lines, including a high proportion of tumor-derived cell lines  <cit> , which may lack the same degree of quality-control as found in normal cells and tissues; 4) most are relatively short ; 5) potentially noncoding cdnas correspond to regions not conserved at the sequence level  <cit> ) and have evolved at a non-selective rate  <cit> ; 6) there is little evidence for cross-species expression ; 7) 70% of intergenic "transfrags" corresponding to novel transcribed regions could not be detected by northern analysis  <cit> ); 8) the "transfrags" do not appear to be enriched in sequences with conserved secondary structures , which is a hallmark feature of known structural ncrnas  <cit> .

how can we distinguish bona fide functional transcripts, in the absence of directed genetic experimentation? sequence conservation alone is apparently not sufficient to distinguish sequences with critical functions, as large-scale non-genic deletions encompassing highly conserved regions can be tolerated in mice without detectable fitness disadvantages  <cit> . the presence of conserved expression improves the likelihood that sequence-conserved regions are functional since most characterized rna classes, including coding mrna, and noncoding rrna, trna, snrna, snorna, and mirna, generally exhibit conserved expression patterns across evolutionarily-related species  <cit> . of the few characterized mrna-like ncrnas, some also have conserved expression patterns  <cit> . the lack of conserved expression of the eight transcripts identified in our study, despite a high sequence and structural similarity, suggests that they are not functional, although it is possible that a subset of functional transcripts have species-or lineage-specific functions despite their high degree of sequence conservation. for example, a subset of the ncrnas detected in mouse in our study were also detected in rat tissues, suggesting the possibility of conserved functions restricted to the rodent lineage. however, in reported cases of mouse-specific ncrnas, such as bc <dig>  tsix, cior, and t-ncb  <cit> , the rnas were not conserved at the sequence level which is likely the reason for mouse-specific ncrna differential regulation.

more cross-species and non-biased expression data is required to definitively address the likelihood of functionality of emerging transcriptomes. the most comprehensive approach will likely be an extension of whole genome tiling microarray analyses  <cit>  using rna derived from endogenous tissues from a variety of organisms. the approach of hybridizing covalently labeled total rna , as opposed to crna or cdna derived from poly-adenylated rna, presents a potential improvement to the unbiased nature of tiling analyses, since there is no amplification bias and strand information is retained. an added dimension of conserved expression will enable focused functional experimentation on transcripts that are likely to be important, although our data indicates that these cases will be the exception rather than the rule.

CONCLUSIONS
with the application of high-throughput transcriptional analyses it has been reported that more sequence is transcribed than was previously appreciated, with some estimates exceeding twice that of currently annotated transcripts. in a systematic search for sequence-conserved transcripts with hallmarks of structural ncrnas, we identified only eight novel mouse transcripts with ubiquitous and abundant expression. this indicates that very little intergenic sequence is transcribed at high levels. furthermore, despite meeting the stringent requirements of characterized ncrnas, none of these eight transcripts were expressed at detectable levels in human cells or tissues. this suggests that these transcripts are unlikely to have conserved functional roles. we propose that newly-identified transcriptomes should be viewed with scrutiny, particularly with regard to function, until it is determined that they are functional or at least display properties of known functional elements.
