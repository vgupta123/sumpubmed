BACKGROUND
satellite cells are adult stem cells specific to skeletal muscle. they are located between the basal lamina and striated muscle cells in muscle tissue, and their principal roles are post-natal growth, maintenance and the regeneration of skeletal muscle  <cit> . satellite cells may undergo asymmetric division for their renewal and produce daughter cells that enter into myogenic differentiation  <cit> . satellite cells are multipotent and can differentiate into early fat storage cells or osteoblasts under different environmental conditions  <cit> . gene expression comparison allows for the characterization of the genes specific to each pathway.

myogenesis is composed of three steps,  alignment of cells,  fusion of cells in myotubes, and  maturation of myotubes. these three steps are regulated by various transcription factors such as the myogenic regulation factors   <cit> . the study of gene expression variation during cell differentiation is fluently used to determine the genes with the most interest  <cit> . it is also well established that interactions between the extra-cellular matrix and cells  <cit>  as well as cell-cell interactions play a major role in myogenesis  <cit> . such regulations and interactions are different from those involved in early-adipogenesis. therefore, both pathways require tightly regulated recognition systems. one of the better systems to enhance specificity of recognition is glycans and adhesion proteins.

glycosylation is a process that leads to the formation of a great diversity of glycan structures. these structures are specifically involved in response to the cell environment during developmental stages, and cell fate  <cit> . we selected genes whose products are involved in glycan synthesis  as well as genes encoding protein, which recognize glycan structure such as lectins , adhesion molecule family  and other adhesion proteins . these genes are called glycosylation related genes . janot et al. demonstrated the change in expression for some of these genes during early myogenic differentiation of the murine cell line c2c <dig>  <cit> . using this cell model, they suggested that myoblast fusion may require glycosphingolipid rearrangements and/or terminal modifications on glycolipids and glycoproteins . among glycoproteins, the adhesion proteins must play a crucial role in cell migration and adhesion; one of the most important families is composed of the integrins  <cit> .

integrins are plasma membrane heterodimers that mediate both cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions  <cit> . integrin subfamilies are classified on the basis of the association of a common β subunit with distinct α subunits to form unique heterodimers. the integrins itga <dig> and itgb <dig> have already been described for their myogenic role. they form the vla- <dig> complex, an essential adhesion complex interacting with vcam <dig> to influence cell alignment and/or cell fusion  <cit> .

in this study, we compared the expression of  <dig> genes during the differentiation of murine satellite cells  into myotubes or early fat storage cells. comparison of gene expressions in both differentiation pathways and previous data on c2c <dig>  <cit>  revealed that only  <dig> genes were mainly involved in myogenesis. fourteen of them have the same variation profile during c2c <dig> and msc myogenesis. the remaining seventeen showed a variation only during msc myogenesis while they were significantly expressed without changes during c2c <dig> differentiation; e.g. the gene encoding the integrin alpha  <dig> subunit . the use of shrna or neutralizing antibodies against this integrin subunit decreased cell fusion by at least 50%. thus itga <dig> is critically involved in myotube formation using msc as a model.

RESULTS
msc differentiation and selection of grg specific to myogenesis
to identify genes which displayed an expression variation in myogenesis with msc as progenitor cells, we profiled and compared gene expression during myogenesis or early-adipogenesis. msc seeded on matrigel® were differentiated by reduction of serum for 72 hours or trans-differentiated in the presence of ambient 50 mm glucose for 168 hours. the time points were chosen to obtain a percentage of myotubes in myogenic differentiation similar to the percentage of early fat storage cells obtained in trans-differentiation. the differentiation state was confirmed by  staining of nuclei in myotubes to quantify the percentage of fusion or to follow fat storage accumulation to determine the trans-differentiation state ; and  measurement of myog, myod <dig>  myf <dig> and myf <dig> myogenic markers and dlk <dig> and ppara markers of the early adipogenic step . in myogenic differentiation conditions, myog expression dramatically increased  during the first 24 hours before reaching a plateau  whereas in trans-differentiated msc it did not exceed  <dig> fold. a contrasting variation of myf <dig> expression was observed, with expression increasing during myogenesis only. surprisingly, myf <dig> and myod <dig> transcription were similar in both pathways. this similarity between trans-differentiation and myogenesis could be explained by the presence of ambient glucose which tends to increase myogenic differentiation in cells already engaged in this process  <cit> . as expected for the adipogenic markers dlk <dig> and ppara, expression increased notably during trans-differentiation whereas no significant variations were observed during myogenesis . these results showed the precise control of msc myogenic differentiation into myotubes or trans-differentiation into early fat storage cells, respectively.

thus, we can follow and compare the expression of glycogenes and genes encoding adhesion proteins during msc differentiation in both pathways. only grg with a change in mrna expression of at least two folds was retained for each differentiation pathway. using this comparative approach we identified  <dig> genes with a significant variation. among them, only  <dig> genes had a variation specific for msc myogenesis . the remaining  <dig>  which also varied during early adipogenesis, were discarded. then, we compared our results with the myoblastic cell line c2c <dig>  <cit> .

grg is specifically involved in myogenesis
since c2c <dig> cultures were seeded on plates without matrigel® in the previous study  <cit> , we controlled that culture on matrigel® did not improve the differentiation potential of these cells. the comparison between cultures of c2c <dig> on plates coated with matrigel® or without it revealed no significant difference in differentiation induction, as recently reported  <cit> . we also demonstrated that no difference appeared in the fusion index and myogenin expression . the expression of itgb <dig> as a reference, during myogenic differentiation of c2c <dig> seeded on plates coated with matrigel® or not, showed no difference between the two culture conditions .

the comparison of  <dig> specifically up or down regulated genes during msc myogenesis to the results obtained by janot et al. <cit>  led to the identification of two subgroups. the first included  <dig> genes without expression variation throughout c2c <dig> differentiation whereas their expression varied during msc differentiation . in the second subgroup,  <dig> genes were identified whose expression varied in both cell types . among the latter, only  <dig> had similar variation profiles during c2c <dig> and msc myogenesis . therefore,  <dig> genes seemed to be essential for myogenic differentiation  and were retained for further studies.

“without a priori” clustering analysis
we performed clustering analysis in order to group genes with similar expression patterns. an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to study  <dig> genes. this approach, described in materials and methods, relies on the time course comparison of differential expression of each gene when c2c <dig> and msc strains are analyzed.

the resulting tree was split into eight groups  are given ) .  <dig> genes  fall into the  <dig> main groups , 8) .  <dig> of the fourteen genes of group a are split into clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in cluster  <dig>  gene expression increased early in differentiation  for c2c <dig> and only at 48 hours for msc . cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> genes from group a with similar expression profiles in both conditions: these genes were clearly down-regulated . in cluster  <dig>  all genes were up-regulated and their expression variation was higher in msc than in c2c <dig> . this cluster also includes  <dig> genes from group b . group  <dig> also contains  <dig> genes from group b which had a significant variation in expression only in msc . the remaining group b genes are split between clusters  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> minor groups ). we observed that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes selected were gathered “without a priori”. it demonstrates the confidence we can have in our selection method.

myogenesis requires the presence of adhesion proteins and the sulfation of keratans
as shown in table  <dig>  we observed the highest changes in expression for chst <dig>  itga <dig> genes which were the most up-regulated  and itgb <dig> which was down-regulated . to understand what cell processes could be affected by these expression variations, we classified the  <dig> genes according to their function  <cit>  . we showed that a large part of these genes encoded adhesion proteins , and only one of them was down-regulated. for the remaining  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes are involved in sulfation with chst <dig> which specifically sulfates the keratans. the  <dig> down-regulated genes were unrelated to myogenesis .we observed a difference with the study of janot et al. <cit>  for genes involved in lacto/neolacto series biosynthesis. indeed, we found none of the seven genes previously described. they were discarded because they varied in both myogenic and early adipogenic pathways.

the selected  <dig> genes  were classified according to the function of their products.

decreased expression of itga <dig> inhibits cell fusion
we observed an increase of itga <dig> in msc during myogenic differentiation . these results correlated well to previously observed mrna levels . gene repression using shrna against itga <dig> and itga <dig>  was performed on msc 24 hours before induction of myogenic differentiation and repression was verified by rt-pcr . the amount of itga <dig> was dramatically reduced in treated msc although it slightly increased during differentiation . a negative plasmid containing shrna without any target in the murine genome was used as control. it showed an up-regulation of itga <dig> before differentiation  that did not affect the fusion ability of the cells . shrna transfected cells  showed a large decrease mrna level in msc . this resulted in a low number of myotubes in treated culture after 72 hours of myogenic differentiation . the fusion index obtained for untreated msc cells or cells treated with the negative control shrna did not display a significant difference . a significant inhibition of msc fusion occurred and the fusion index only reached  <dig> % for shrna treatment after 72 hour differentiation .

itga <dig> antibodies inhibited the cell fusion
regarding the effect of itga <dig> down-regulation, we proceeded to study the neutralization of itga <dig> during differentiation. treatments were performed on msc cultures with antibodies against itga <dig> or itga <dig> . after 3 days, the fusion index was significantly reduced for both treatments . at 72 hours, the fusion indexes of treated cells were reduced by approximately 65% in both cases. in msc cultures containing both antibodies, the fusion index was decreased by 90% after 72 hour differentiation . this result indicated a direct involvement of itga <dig> in the msc fusion and  <dig> different effects of both integrins in this process.

decreased expression of chst <dig> delayed the cell fusion
we observed a large up-regulation of chst <dig> during the differentiation of msc. so we treated msc cultures with shrna against chst <dig> and controlled the induced repression by rt-pcr . we also controlled the correlation with the protein amount by western blot in msc . the treated cultures showed a decrease of chst <dig> expression and a lower protein amount. after 24 hours in the differentiation condition, the fusion index observed in culture treated with shrna against chst <dig> was significantly lower than that observed for the untreated culture . this difference remains until 72 hours of differentiation but appeared to decrease. this indicates that chst <dig> inhibition only induced a delay in msc fusion. this result and those obtained for itga <dig> strengthen our gene selection.

discussion
cell migration, adhesion and fusion require many changes in the cell surface and environment during myogenesis. janot et al.  used a rt-pcr-based screening method to detect  <dig> glycosylation related genes  with a large variation in expression during the early myogenic differentiation of c2c <dig>  <cit> . however, the genes specifically involved in myogenesis were not distinguished from those that were expressed independently from a differentiation pathway and those which were associated with c2c <dig> immortality. in this study we refined the screening using murine satellite cells  since  they better reflected the in vivo state and  they can be differentiated into myotubes or into early fat storage cells. by comparing  <dig> grg  expression in msc differentiated in one or the other differentiation pathway we retained  <dig> genes specifically associated with the myogenesis out of  <dig> studied.

compared to grg previously found by janot et al., these  <dig> genes can be divided into two groups. the first one contains  <dig> genes whose expression varies in only msc. the second is composed of  <dig> genes with variation in both c2c <dig> and msc,  <dig> only showing the same pattern of expression. we did not retain the  <dig> other genes because differences in their expression profiles seemed to depend on cell type rather than on myogenesis. the discrepancy between these results and the ones previously published by janot and co-workers is mainly due to a more drastic screening that discards genes common to pre-adipogenic and myogenic differentiation. so, we retained  <dig> genes that seem specifically involved in myogenic differentiation.

we strengthened our selection by using “without a priori” clustering of grg selected in the msc model. we found  <dig> of the previously selected  <dig> genes were distributed into  <dig> clusters among the  <dig> clusters obtained. cluster  <dig> included all  <dig> down-regulated genes.  <dig> of them had a similar variation during c2c <dig> and msc myogenesis . since the other  <dig> genes were all up-regulated in c2c <dig> and/or msc, they were mainly found in  <dig> clusters: clusters  <dig> and  <dig> which contain  <dig> group a genes and  <dig> group b gene; clusters  <dig> and  <dig> which contain  <dig> group b genes and  <dig> group a genes. this demonstrates that our separation and the distribution by “without a priori” clustering of the grg were very close.

to explore the relationship between grg up- and down-regulation, and myogenesis, we classified them according to the function of their products . our first observation was for art <dig>  one of the most up-regulated genes, it encodes a mono-adp-ribosyltranferase with a specific expression in myotubes.  <dig> of the classified genes encoded proteins, which are involved in glycan synthesis or modifications such as sulfation  or hydrolysis . most of them are responsible for extracellular matrix synthesis ; they are up-regulated while those coding for sulfation of glycans carried by glycolipids or glycoproteins are down-regulated . the alignment of cells and myotubes requires a different structural organization of the extracellular matrix molecules such as lumican, composed of keratan sulfates  <cit> . in this study, an up-regulation of b4galt <dig> and chst <dig> involved in keratan sulfate biosynthesis was observed. the latter also depends on the synthesis of o-glycan core  <dig> structure.  <dig> up-regulated genes encoding proteins of the o-glycan biosynthesis pathway, galntl <dig> and gcnt <dig>  are also implicated. in addition, considering all up- or down-regulated grg during myogenic differentiation, without taking into account their variation in early adipogenesis, we found that grg expression variations were more favourable for core  <dig> biosynthesis . indeed, gcnt <dig> was up-regulated in both differentiation pathways. however, in myogenic cells, biosynthesis continued to keratan sulfate since b4galt <dig> and chst <dig> gene expression increased. so, we propose that the regulation of some grg contributes to core  <dig> o-glycan biosynthesis and subsequently that of keratan sulfates and lumican for myotube arrangements. finally, it has been shown recently that gcnt <dig> up-regulation is associated with myocardial hypertrophy in mice  <cit> , which supports our theory.

significant adhesion protein involvement during cell fusion is likely since  <dig> of the  <dig> genes encode proteins of this family. among them, we observed an up-regulation of a protein containing a lectin domain, clec2d, a murine osteoclast inhibitory lectin  <cit>  necessary to promote msc myogenesis. the lgals <dig> lectin plays a key role in stabilization of glycoconjugates in epithelial repair  <cit> . it could play a similar stabilizing role in myogenesis. the up-regulation found for cd <dig> or endosialin, known as a potential actor of angiogenesis in which it contributes to cell-cell alignment and contacts  <cit> , seems to be explained. again, up-regulation of klra <dig> , a cell surface receptor of class  <dig> myosin heavy chain, could be related to the high expression of its ligand in skeletal muscle  <cit> .

we also found into adhesion proteins  <dig> integrin subunits  and  <dig> adhesion molecules . icam <dig>  whose expression increases during c2c <dig> and msc myogenesis, is notably expressed in adult satellite cells  <cit> . it can link α-actin/actin to form a membrane-actin interaction that reinforces cell-cell interactions as described in neuroblastomas  <cit> . mcam is known to have a role in cellular adhesion and in cohesion of the endothelial monolayer  <cit> ; it could have the same role in myogenesis. moreover, cerletti et al. reported that mcam gene is highly expressed in human foetal myogenic cells  <cit> . therefore, there is a good relationship between this result and the up-regulation found in msc. the integrin family is of particular interest and is often involved in cell contact, signaling, adhesion and fusion  <cit> . from our results, a network model , with a central role for the integrins, is proposed to partially explain myogenesis regulation. the itga <dig> gene encoding an integrin subunit  was up-regulated. itga <dig> forms a heterodimeric complex with itgb <dig> and then with nischarin during control of cell migration  <cit> . interestingly we observed that hpse was also up-regulated. the protein encoded by this gene  is known for its role in cell migration through the digestion of ecm, creating a balance with itga <dig> activity  <cit> . we noticed the up-regulation of itgb <dig>  the itgb <dig> protein, associated with itgav and a metalloprotease, activates transforming growth factor β- <dig>  in epithelial cells or neurons  <cit> . although tgf-β <dig> is known to inhibit myogenic differentiation  <cit> , gouttenoire et al. demonstrated that it can also activate itga <dig> transcription in mouse chondrocytes  <cit> . in addition, genes encoding hyaluronan synthases has <dig> and has <dig> are up-regulated and hyaluronans are described to promote sequestration of the tgf-β <dig> receptor in lipid rafts which limits their interaction with tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . finally, up-regulation of chst <dig> involved in dermatan sulfate biosynthesis may indicate an increase in the production of decorin, known to bind and regulate the sensitivity of chicken satellite cells to tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . all results suggest that cells could regulate tgf-β <dig> effects through different pathways and may limit its action to itga <dig> activation . our model also used cell signalling according to the up-regulated integrin subunit itga <dig>  it forms a complex with itgb1which has recently been described as essential for neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. the binding of the complex to laminin molecules induced differentiation  <cit>  so we integrated a similar system in our model of myogenesis. recently, itga <dig> was linked to the expression of cell migration-related genes  <cit> , it could be also play a role in cell migration as itga <dig> 

laminin can also bind α-dystroglycan and organize muscle structure. the 120 kda form of α-dystroglycan, in chicken myoblast cultures, is present at the late stage of myogenesis  <cit> . this form is likely to be less rich in mannose type o-glycan. in our model, we associated the decrease in pmm <dig> and chst <dig> expression with this phenomenon. because pmm <dig> is involved in udp-mannose synthesis and the sulfotransferase, chst <dig>  is responsible for terminal sulfation of o-mannosyl glycans, they are presumably involved in cell adhesion  <cit>  and could be related to the structures present on the α-dystroglycan molecule  <cit> .

earlier, we showed that itga <dig> showed the highest variation in expression. this gene encoding the itga <dig> subunit has also been shown to be up-regulated during myofibroblast differentiation in cardiomyopathy  <cit> . we included this integrin in our model because it has already been described to be produced by human corneal myoblasts and to be involved in development of the latter  <cit> . to verify the involvement of selected grg in myogenesis, itga <dig> and chst <dig> were chosen for a functional study. treatment of msc with shrna directed against the itga <dig> transcript before and during myogenic differentiation strongly inhibited cell fusion. itga <dig> depletion stopped the fusion after 24 hours only . the mrfs expressions were followed during the differentiation of treated cells and we observed a complete inhibition of the myf <dig> expression . the expression of myf <dig> is usually related to the fusion process. the addition of anti-itga <dig> antibodies strongly inhibited fusion; after 72 hours, under differentiation conditions, less than 7% fusion was observed. the same result was obtained with anti-itga <dig> antibodies and itga <dig> is known for its involvement in fusion during myogenesis  <cit> . the combined action of antibodies against both integrins completely inhibited cell fusion. this result demonstrated that the effect of each antibody could be cumulative . since no compensations were observed in shrna experiments, we suggest that the two integrins contribute independently to the binding of cells to different mec components. now it is clear that itga <dig> plays a role during myogenesis, especially in the fusion process. the cells treated with shrna against chst <dig> showed a delay in fusion during the first 48 hours of differentiation. however, they recovered a fusion index quietly similar to untreated cells at 72 hours under differentiation conditions. this effect could be explained by the involvement of chst <dig> in the sulfation of keratans. the low amount of chst <dig> during 48 hours of differentiation was not sufficient to permit enough sulfation of keratans and thus the cell fusion. beyond of the 48 hours, the keratan sulfate amount was sufficient to allow a quick fusion of cells. indeed, at 72 hours of differentiation the fusion index was close between treated and untreated cultures. this result correlated to the mrfs expression observed during the differentiation of treated cells . indeed, myog up-regulation during the first 24 hours showed that cells are engaged in myogenesis. the myf <dig> expression increased only from 48 hours and harshly rose until 72 hours as observed for the fusion index. these results demonstrate the importance of chst <dig> to initiate the fusion step of myogenesis. the relationship between itga <dig>  chst <dig> and myogenesis step strengthens our selection as well as our myogenic regulation model.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the comparison between the adipogenic and myogenic differentiation of mscs, as well as between two cell types  that differentiate into myotubes allowed us to select  <dig> genes whose expression is particularly associated with myogenesis. we classified these genes into  <dig> groups, according to the function of the proteins they encode:  remodelling of the extracellular matrix where genes are predominantly up-regulated such as chst5;  glycan biosynthesis with more particularly an up-regulation of genes involved in core  <dig> glycan synthesis;  adhesion where genes are mainly up-regulated such as itga <dig>  we have also shown that itga <dig> knockdown and neutralization of itga <dig> protein strongly inhibit cell fusion whereas the knockdown of chst <dig> delayed the fusion of myoblast. these results emphasize our selection of genes and their involvement in myogenesis. we suggest a potential regulation network for myogenesis in which some grgs are strongly implicated. finally, this study provides a suitable complementary method for the study of specific differentiation pathways.
