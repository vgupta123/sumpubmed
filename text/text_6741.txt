BACKGROUND
metazoan mitochondrial genomes  are double-stranded circular dnas typically 16– <dig> kbp in size . they are maternally inherited as haploid genomes with multiple copy numbers in a cell. metazoan mitogenomes encode a set of  <dig> genes for two ribosomal rnas,  <dig> trnas, and  <dig> respiratory protein subunits  <cit>  and also possess a major noncoding region or control region that contains signals for the initiation of replication and transcription . in addition, most vertebrate mitogenomes conserve a characteristic stem-and-loop structure between trnaasn and trnacys genes that acts as the putative origin of light-strand replication   <cit> .

the organization of the  <dig> genes and the major noncoding region varies considerably between metazoan classes but is relatively conserved within vertebrata  <cit> . the typical vertebrate gene organization , which was first revealed for the human mitogenome  <cit> , is shared by many species of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. however, deviation from this typical organization has been found in species of all these vertebrate groups and birds . the majority of gene rearrangement cases in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes involve shuffling of some neighboring genes  or the translocation of genes across duplicated control regions, for example in snake mitogenomes  <cit> . gene inversions are quite rare in vertebrate mitogenomes though not unknown  <cit> .figure  <dig>

recent technical advances in sequencing have led to the rapid accumulation of complete or nearly complete mitogenomic sequences and the mitogenomic sequences of over  <dig> vertebrate species are currently known  <cit> . approximately half of them are from fishes with the remainder from tetrapods, where mammals dominate over reptiles. to the best of our knowledge, only  <dig> species have been sequenced from the gekkota, which consists of more than  <dig> species of geckos and their allies  <cit> . these known gekkotan mitogenomes share the typical vertebrate gene organization although polymorphic tandem duplications with varying sizes  have been reported for the parthenogenetic heteronotia binoei
 <cit>  and potential pseudogenization of the trnagln gene was found in hemitheconyx caudicinctus
 <cit> .

previous studies proposed that some vertebrate groups may be more susceptible to mitogenomic gene rearrangements than the others. for example, ranoid frogs include a variety of gene rearrangements in their mitogenomes while most non-neobatrachian frogs conserve the typical gene organization . amongst lizards, agamidae contain several different types of gene rearrangement  <cit>  but no mitogenomic rearrangement has been reported from the closely related family, iguanidae  <cit> . this heterogeneity in the occurrence of gene rearrangements among different vertebrate groups has been examined in relation to loss of the light-strand replication origin  <cit> , duplication of the control region  <cit> , or changes of the rate of molecular evolution  <cit> , although none of these causal hypotheses have been fully examined across diverse vertebrate groups.

here, we report seven new mitogenomic sequences from gekkonidae  and describe several new gene rearrangements that involve shuffling, loss, and reassignment of trna genes. we discuss evolutionary mechanisms for the gene rearrangements and their effects on the mitochondrial translational system.

RESULTS
gene arrangement in the tropiocolotes tripolitanusmitogenome
we used high-throughput sequencing to determine nucleotide sequences of seven new mitochondrial genomes from gekkonidae . although mitogenomic sequences of tropiocolotes steudneri, lepidodactylus lugubris, and phelsuma guimbeaui were found to possess the typical vertebrate gene organization , deviations from this organization were seen in the other gekkonid mitogenomes.table  <dig>

accession and voucher numbers represent, respectively, numbers of mitogenomic nucleotide sequences registered to the ddbj/embl/genbank database and those of whole-body specimens registered to sdncu .

an asterisk means that the corresponding mitogenome could not be completely sequenced because of extensive long tandem duplications in the major noncoding region.



the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of tropiocolotes tripolitanus is  <dig>  bp  and encodes all  <dig> mitochondrial genes in addition to containing the major noncoding region  located between trnapro and trnaphe genes . at the 5’ end of the major noncoding region, there are four tandem repeats of a 74-bp sequence, while at its 3’ end there are  <dig> tandem repeats of a 100-bp sequence, followed by a second weakly repetitive sequence. in the middle of the major noncoding region, three conserved sequence block  motifs   <cit>  are found. the central part of the major noncoding region is therefore regarded as the control region that regulates replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome  <cit> .

the t. tripolitanus mitogenome has the typical vertebrate gene organization, except for a region between nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  and trnahis genes . this region usually contains an array of genes  in the typical vertebrate organization . however, the corresponding region in t. tripolitanus contains a rearranged set of genes  where genes with an asterisk may be pseudogenes . to exclude the possibility that this gene arrangement resulted from erroneous high-throughput dna sequencing or assembly, we carefully amplified and re-sequenced this region using various combinations of  <dig> species-specific primers . the resultant sequence was identical to the one determined by high-throughput dna sequencing.

the trnagln <dig> gene next to the nd <dig> gene  is encoded by the heavy strand, while another trnagln <dig> gene  encoded by the light strand occurs between trnaile and trnamet genes. the position and orientation of the latter trnagln <dig> gene matches the typical vertebrate gene organization . figure  <dig> illustrates the secondary structures of these two trnagln genes. both the trnagln genes can assume stable clover-leaf structures. the trnagln <dig> gene has a clear sequence similarity with the trnaarg gene ; there are only four base differences between them with one at the second anticodon position . these two trna genes are thus paralogs and one of them  was created by gene duplication and subsequent base substitution at the second anticodon position.figure  <dig>

regions adjacent to the trnagln <dig> and trnaarg genes are homologous, sharing sequences related to nd4l genes . the former has a complete nd4l coding region, whereas the latter has frequent indels and severely reduced sequence similarity to nd4l genes from other geckos . in-frame translation of this nd4l pseudogene does not show any detectable level of sequence similarity with nd4l amino acid sequences of other geckos due to frameshift indels .

these two nd4l-related regions are followed by another pair of homologous sequences with high sequence similarity to nd <dig> genes from other geckos . these two nd4-related sequences do not have in-frame stop codons and are easily aligned to each other without indels . the second nd4-related sequence preceding the trnahis gene is shorter than the first one preceding the trnaarg gene but has a slightly increased sequence similarity to nd <dig> sequences from other geckos, especially at amino acids 291– <dig> and 403– <dig> . we therefore tentatively assume the second sequence to be a legitimate nd <dig> gene and regard the first one as a possible pseudogene. however, it also seems possible that both copies are functional genes in t. tripolitanus mitochondria.

gene arrangement in the stenodactylus petriimitogenome
the s. petrii mitogenome is  <dig>  bp in length  and includes all  <dig> mitochondrial genes . it shows two changes from the typical vertebrate gene organization. first, there are four tandemly duplicated copies of trnaleu  between 16s rrna and nd <dig> genes. these four genes have high sequence similarity to each other  and it is evident that they have been created by recent tandem duplications. the first gene located at the 5’ end of this tandem duplication lacks some basic trna secondary structures and may now be a pseudogene. the fourth copy seems to have the most stable secondary structure but the second and third copies may also be functional trnaleu  genes in light of the structural criterion of mitochondrial trna genes  <cit> . we have samples of two more s. petrii individuals. sequencing the corresponding region of these individuals showed a single trnaleu  gene between 16s rrna and nd <dig> genes .

second, there is a shuffling of trna genes and the ol contained in the wan  cy trna gene cluster. four tandem copies of trnaala and the ol were found at the 5’ end of the remaining wncy genes . all four trnaala and ol copies have an identical sequence , suggesting that the tandem duplications were very recent. we amplified and sequenced a mitogenomic region between the nd <dig> and cytochrome oxidase subunit  <dig>  genes from the two additional s. petrii individuals to show that one has only two tandem repeats of trnaala and ol while the other has four tandem repeats . repeat number of this region is polymorphic within species.

occurrence of gene rearrangements in other tropiocolotesand stenodactylusspecies
the genus tropiocolotes includes  <dig> species distributed in saharo-arabian regions  <cit> . another genus, stenodactylus, with a similar distribution, is closely related to tropiocolotes according to recent molecular phylogenetic studies , although precise phylogeny at the species level has not been established. we examined the occurrence of the gene rearrangements found in t. tripolitanus and s. petrii mitogenomes among other species of these genera. first, the tropiocolotes steudneri mitogenomic sequence is  <dig>  bp in length . the major noncoding region of this species contains rather long arrays of repetitive sequences that were not completely sequenced. the t. steudneri mitogenome includes all sets of  <dig> mitochondrial genes with the typical gene organization of vertebrates . neither of the two types of gene rearrangements found in t. tripolitanus and s. petrii occur in this species.

we also examined gene organizations of a few other species by pcr amplification and sequencing. figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig> shows 1% agarose gel electrophoresis of pcr products amplified using rnd3-1l and rcun-3h primers . as expected, a large product was amplified from t. tripolitanus  owing to the gene rearrangements described above. in contrast, microgecko  persicus, tropiocolotes steudneri, and stenodactylus petrii gave rise to shorter products , supporting that the mitogenomes of these species do not have the above gene rearrangements.

these results suggest that the rearranged gene arrangements shown in figure 1b are not widely distributed among tropiocolotes and stenodactylus geckos. the gene rearrangements may have occurred relatively recently on a lineage leading to t. tripolitanus after its divergence from the other examined species. this view is supported by an observation that two paralogous nd <dig> amino acid sequences of t. tripolitanus are much more similar to each other than they are to counterparts in other gecko species . these two paralogous sequences also share an insertion at sites 253– <dig> , suggesting that this insertion event took place after the divergence from a lineage leading to t. steudneri but before the duplication of the nd <dig> gene.

the mitogenomic region between the nd <dig> and co <dig> genes amplified from stenodactylus doriae was somewhat longer than that from stenodactylus slevini . stenodactylus slevini turned out to have the typical wancy gene organization but s. doriae had another unique gene arrangement: wan*cny, where n* represents a possible pseudogene of the trnaasn gene . the n* gene has a considerably weaker acceptor-stem secondary structure than the n gene . together with the information derived from t. tripolitanus and t. steudneri , these results suggest that the gene rearrangement found in s. petrii, in which trnaala and ol are translocated to the 5’ end of wncy genes , is not widely distributed among tropiocolotes and stenodactylus geckos. this translocation and the possible translocation of the trnaasn gene found in s. doriae probably took place independently in each lineage.

loss of the trnaglugene from the uroplatus ebenauimitogenome
complete mitogenomic sequences obtained for uroplatus fimbriatus and u. ebenaui are  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp in length, respectively . these mitogenomes possess the typical vertebrate gene organization, except for the disappearance of trnaglu, which is usually located between nd <dig> and cytochrome b  genes . the corresponding intergenic region retains 54- and 62-bp sequences in each species . however, these sequences do not show detectable sequence similarity to trnaglu genes from five non-uroplatus geckos . the trnaglu genes of these non-uroplatus geckos are 68– <dig> bp in length, somewhat longer than the uroplatus intergenic sequences.figure  <dig> 
heavy-strand nucleotide sequences between nd <dig> and cytb genes for
uroplatus
 and other geckos . sequences in this region for non-uroplatus geckos represent trnaglu genes, which are aligned based on clover-leaf secondary structure  <cit> . in b, trnaglu gene sequences found at the 5’ end of the major noncoding region for u. fimbriatus and u. sikorae are also shown. alignment of the uroplatus intergenic sequences in a was made with the aid of clustalx  <cit> . uroplatus gecko sequences were given the following abbreviations: ufim, u. fimbriatus; usik, u. sikorae; ulin. u. lineatus; upie, u. pietschmanni; uebe, u. ebenaui; upha, u. phantasticus; and ugue, u. guentheri . sequence data of trnaglu gene sequences for non-uroplatus geckos are taken from tropiocolotes tripolitanus , tropiocolotes steudneri , stenodactylus petrii , gekko vittatus , and coleonyx variegatus .



we sequenced this intergenic region for five more uroplatus species  with rnd6-3l  and ucytb-1h primers . intergenic sequences of 55– <dig> bp in length were found in each species but they do not show appreciable sequence similarity with each other . thus, it is unlikely that these intergenic sequences in uroplatus species encode any conserved gene sequence. there is also no evidence to suggest that these intergenic sequences were evolutionarily derived from trnaglu genes.

functional trnaglu gene sequences were carefully searched for over the complete mitogenomic sequences of the two uroplatus taxa. it was found that the u. fimbriatus mitogenome encodes a trnaglu gene adjacent to the 5’ end of the major noncoding region . however, no trnaglu-like sequence was found in the u. ebenaui mitogenome . coding regions in both taxa between trnaphe and trnapro genes do not have a notable intergenic region > <dig> bp in length, except for the nd6-cytb intergenic region described above.

the major noncoding regions of u. fimbriatus and u. ebenaui are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. these noncoding regions include tandem repeat sequences and the csb1- <dig> sequences but trnaglu-like structures were not found, either by the cove program as implemented in dogma  <cit>  or by visual inspection for a standard mitochondrial trna gene structure  <cit> . we therefore conclude that the trnaglu gene is lacking from the mitogenome of u. ebenaui.

the major noncoding region was amplified and sequenced for the other five uroplatus species using uthr-2l and r12s-1h  primers . as a result, only one of them  has the trnaglu gene at the 5’ end of the major noncoding region, similar to u. fimbriatus, whereas u. pietschmanni, u. guentheri, u. phantasticus, and u. lineatus do not have the trnaglu gene located near the major noncoding region, as in u. ebenaui . these results show that the disappearance of the trnaglu gene from the nd6/cytb junction is a common feature among the uroplatus mitogenomes but that translocation to the 5’ end of the major noncoding region only occurs in some uroplatus species.

discussion
mechanism of gene rearrangements
in the t. tripolitanus mitogenome , a region from the trnagln <dig> gene to the nd4* gene has a sequence similarity with the region from the trnaarg gene to the nd <dig> gene. this gene rearrangement originated from the tandem duplication of three genes: trnaarg, nd4l and nd <dig> . one duplicate copy of the nd4l and nd <dig> genes has subsequently been pseudogenized, while in a duplicate copy of trnaarg a base substitution  at the second anticodon position converted the identity of the trna gene from trnaarg to trnagln. three accompanying base substitutions, at positions between the acceptor and d stems, in the extra arm and in the t loop, have also occurred .figure  <dig> 
plausible pathway of the gene rearrangements found for the
t. tripolitanus
mitogenome based on the tandem duplication-random loss model. mitochondrial genes are illustrated as in figure  <dig> and thick horizontal bars show a unit for tandem duplication. from the typical gene arrangement , three genes were tandemly duplicated . reassignment of a trna gene  and pseudogenization of duplicate protein genes gave rise to the t. tripolitanus gene arrangement . in future, deletion of redundant genes or pseudogenes may lead to a rearranged organization shown as state  <dig> 



this plausible mechanism for the gene rearrangement that gave rise to the t. tripolitanus mitogenome  is consistent with the tandem duplication-random loss  model  <cit>  that has been postulated to explain most vertebrate mitochondrial gene rearrangements  <cit> . the tdrl model assumes a tandem duplication of a mitochondrial dna segment and subsequent deletion of one of the duplicate gene copies, leading to a rearranged gene organization or reversal to the original organization. deletion of the redundant gene copy may happen rapidly as it is free from functional constraint and therefore base changes can readily occur, facilitating its pseudogenization or complete deletion. this may also be driven by strong pressure for size reduction of metazoan mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the finding of duplicate genes between trnagln <dig> and nd <dig> genes in the t. tripolitanus mitogenome, but not in any other mitogenomes of closely related species , is in agreement with this reasoning if the duplication is recent. thus, we consider that the gene organization found in the t. tripolitanus mitogenome is not stable and may soon lead to the complete deletion of redundant pseudogenes, as shown in figure  <dig>  alternatively, the apparently redundant nd4l and nd <dig> pseudogenes may not be deleted easily if they play roles in translating mrnas for overlapping protein genes . it is well known that reading frames for vertebrate nd4l and nd <dig> genes partly overlap and that mature mrnas for these genes occur as a di-cistronic mrna  <cit> .

with respect to the mechanisms underlying the gene rearrangements in the stenodactylus petrii mitogenome , tandem duplications of the trnaleu gene can occur by slipped-strand mispairing during mitogenome replication  <cit> . in the wan cy trna gene cluster, translocation of the trnaala gene and ol cy to awncy) probably occurred first by a process consistent with the tdrl model  <cit> . then, the slipped-strand mispairing could have resulted in 4-fold copying of a to generate the s. petrii gene arrangement . the intraspecific occurrence of 2- and 4-fold copies of the a, as described in results, are consistent with this mechanism.

we also inferred the process of loss and translocation of the trnaglu gene for uroplatus geckos. because all uroplatus taxa examined in this study lack a trnaglu gene at the nd6/cytb gene boundary and because all non-uroplatus geckos examined to date have this gene at this location, the disappearance of the trnaglu gene from this boundary likely occurred in the common ancestor of uroplatus. the most straightforward explanation is that the trnaglu gene was translocated to the 5’ end of the major noncoding region by the tdrl of a four gene block: trnaglu, cytb, trnathr, and trnapro . this translocated trnaglu gene was later lost from all other uroplatus species, giving rise to the gene arrangement shown in figure 1e.

previous molecular phylogenetic studies of uroplatus
 <cit>  suggested a sister relationship between u. fimbriatus and u. sikorae; however, they are not sister species but are nested in a clade of other uroplatus species . if true, this raises the possibility that the mitogenome of the most recent common ancestor of all uroplatus taxa had the trnaglu gene at the 5’ end of the major noncoding region and that it has disappeared from descendant uroplatus lineages multiple times. an alternative possibility is that the trnaglu gene was already lost from the most recent common ancestor but that a trnaglu gene was newly created in the common ancestor of u. fimbriatus and u. sikorae by a mechanism such as tandem duplication of another trna gene and reassignment of a duplicate gene copy to trnaglu via anticodon mutation. however, the trnaglu genes of u. fimbriatus and u. sikorae retain high sequence similarity to those of other geckos , which is not consistent with the latter possibility.

two functional trnaglngenes in the t. tripolitanusmitogenome?
an intriguing question is whether the t. tripolitanus mitogenome encodes two functional trnagln genes whose products can function in mitochondrial protein synthesis. caa and cag are two glutamine codons in the genetic code of vertebrate mitochondria and these codons are usually decoded by a single trnagln encoded in a mitogenome  <cit> . there is no need to duplicate the trnagln gene for mitochondrial protein synthesis. table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> provides evidence for no genetic code change at these codons in t. tripolitanus mitochondria. there is also no evidence for codon use change. glutamine codons  appear in protein-coding genes of the t. tripolitanus mitogenome as frequently as in the mitogenomes of  <dig> other geckos . the relative frequency of caa vs. cag codons is not significantly different from that averaged among the  <dig> geckos .table  <dig>

the secondary structures of the trnagln <dig> and trnagln <dig> genes  conserve several features of functional mitochondrial trna genes  <cit> . briefly, both the trnagln genes retain many base pairings in the stem regions and share an identical anticodon sequence  in the middle of a canonical 7-nucleotide anticodon-loop. the 5’ and 3’ nucleotides of the anticodon are, respectively, t and a purine  for both genes. two intervening nucleotides occur between the acceptor-stem and d-stem, whereas a single extra nucleotide occurs between the d-stem and anticodon-stem. the extra arm between the anticodon-stem and t-stem has four nucleotides in both trnagln genes, the typical number for vertebrate mitochondrial trna genes   <cit> . finally, no intervening nucleotide occurs between the t-stem and acceptor-stem. these trnagln genes appear to comply with the basic structural requirements of mitochondrial trna genes.

however, an extra requirement should be considered for trnagln genes encoded by vertebrate mitogenomes. eukaryotic mitochondria, as well as all known archaea and most bacteria, lack a glutaminyl-trna synthetase , which is responsible for charging trnagln with glutamine  <cit> . instead, they use the non-discriminating glutamyl-trna synthetase  to charge both trnaglu and trnagln with glutamic acid, thus forming glu-trnaglu and glu-trnagln, respectively. glu-trnagln is then converted to gln-trnagln by an amidotransferase  . the crystal structure of an archaeal non-discriminating glurs in comparison with that of an e. coli glnrs-trnagln complex  <cit>  indicated that the non-discriminating glurs recognizes anticodon nucleotides at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  but not at position  <dig> . it therefore seems possible that, in t. tripolitanus mitochondria, trnas expressed from both the trnagln <dig> and trnagln <dig> genes could be charged with glutamic acid by the mitochondrial non-discriminating glurs.

recently, the crystal structure of the bacterial ‘glutamine transamidosome complex’, consisting of trnagln, glurs, and adt, indicated that glutamylation and transamidation may be consecutive reactions and that glurs and adt may take on conformational changes to compete for the acceptor stem of trnagln as their reaction target  <cit> . the same study showed that the bacterial adt does not interact with the anticodon nucleotides of its substrate trnagln but recognizes the trnagln-specific tertiary structure at an outer corner of the l-shaped trnagln, especially in the d loop side.

it is well known that nonmitochondrial trnas conserve several nucleotides that are involved in forming the rigid l-shaped structure by tertiary hydrogen bondings, such as g18-Ψ <dig>  and g19-c <dig>  sequence comparison of mitochondrial trnagln genes from various vertebrates indicated that g18g <dig> in the d loop and t55t56c57r58a <dig> in the t loop are well conserved  while many other mitochondrial trna genes do not conserve these bases  <cit> . this observation is consistent with a view that formation of a standard l-shaped tertiary structure is necessary for a trnagln to be catalyzed by the mitochondrial adt. tropiocolotes tripolitanus trnagln <dig> conserves these bases for the tertiary interactions but trnagln <dig> does not . the latter even truncates nucleotides in the d and t loops considerably. because mitochondrial trnas lacking the d loop/t loop interactions take on severely loosened tertiary structures  <cit> , they may not be a good substrate for the transamidation reaction catalyzed by the mitochondrial adt.figure  <dig>

taken together, these results suggest that both trnagln <dig> and trnagln <dig> are possibly glutamylated in t. tripolitanus mitochondria but that only glu-trnagln <dig> may be efficiently converted to gln-trnagln <dig> for the protein synthesis. this implies that glu-trnagln <dig> possibly remains as an inactive form or has become a harmful reagent that can decode car codons as glutamic acid, rather than glutamine. in this regard, nagao et al.  <cit>  found that human mitochondria do not allow glu-trnagln to participate in protein synthesis because it is not efficiently recognized by mitochondrial elongation factor tu. thus, glu-trnagln <dig> might simply be a harmless byproduct in t. tripolitanus mitochondria. alternatively, though less likely, the mitochondrial adts may be able to recognize both trnagln <dig> and trnagln <dig> by a different mechanism from that of the bacterial adts. metazoan mitochondrial aminoacyl-trna synthetases were suggested to have simplified recognition mechanisms towards substrate trnas in response to the decrease of structural constraints on mitochondrial trnas  <cit> . we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that the trnagln <dig> gene serves as the second functional trnagln gene in t. tripolitanus mitochondria.

source of trnaglufor protein synthesis in u. ebenauimitochondria
we found that the uroplatus ebenaui mitogenome apparently lacks the trnaglu gene. if so, how could protein synthesis be performed in u. ebenaui mitochondria? gaa and gag are two codons for glutamic acid in the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code  <cit>  and no genetic code change is suggested for these codons in u. ebenaui mitochondria . because glutamic acid codons  appear in protein-coding genes of the u. ebenaui mitogenome as frequently as in those of the mitogenomes of  <dig> geckos , there must be a trnaglu that is responsible for decoding these codons.

the most straightforward explanation is an import of nuclear-encoded cytosolic trnaglu into the mitochondrion. the import of cytosolic trnas into vertebrate mitochondria has been suspected for some taxa. for example, marsupial mitogenomes do not appear to encode functional trnalys genes  <cit> . biochemical experiments later supported the import of cytosolic trnalys into marsupial mitochondria  <cit> . the import of cytosolic trnas into mitochondria is more common in non-vertebrates . the majority of trnas necessary for mitochondrial protein synthesis are not encoded by the tetrahymena mitogenome and are imported from the cytosol  <cit> .

it seems noteworthy in this regard that the relative frequency of gaa vs. gag codons in the u. ebenaui mitogenome is very strongly deviated  from that averaged among  <dig> geckos, whereas there is no significant  deviation of this relative frequency for u. fimbriatus and two tropiocolotes species . in general, codon usage in an organism reflects various factors, such as gc content of the genome and the relative abundance and translational efficiency of trnas that decode different codons . in animal mitochondria, strand-specific base composition bias was also proposed as a major factor  <cit> . if u. ebenaui mitochondria do use trnaglu imported from the cytosol, it seems possible that the usage of gaa and gag codons is adapted to the different codon-decoding abilities of the imported cytosolic trnaglu with regard to gaa and gag.

an alternative explanation is that post-transcriptional modifications may create a trnaglu from other trna genes. enzymatic modification of anticodon bases of trnas could change decoding specificity from one amino acid to another . rna editing could also change the decoding specificity of trnas. rna editing is known to occur in various metazoan mitochondrial trnas . in marsupial mitochondria, a c to u editing at the second anticodon position switches a trnagly  to trnaasp   <cit> . similar rna editing of a g to c change at the third anticodon base of trnagln might supply the missing trnaglu for uroplatus mitochondria. however, this rna editing would need to occur concomitantly with other modifications in, e.g., the d arm, in order not to be converted from glu-trnaglu to gln-trnaglu by transamidation .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, seven new mitogenomic sequences were determined from gekkonidae with the aid of high-throughput sequencing. several new gene rearrangements were found and gekkonidae can no longer be considered a group in which mitochondrial gene rearrangements rarely occur. although the high-throughput sequencing has a weak point in assembling repeat sequences, we were able to demonstrate that moderately repetitive sequences, as found in the t. tripolitanus mitogenome, can be reliably assembled by this method. in future, high-throughput sequencing will further contribute to efficient and accurate mitogenomic sequencing from numerous metazoan taxa.

although mitochondrial gene rearrangements have been described in various taxa, an intermediate type of gene arrangement that is indicative of molecular evolutionary mechanisms is rarely found. the unique gene arrangement found in the t. tripolitanus mitogenome provides an opportunity to study relatively new gene rearrangements in which the duplicate state of genes is maintained. based on the characterization of duplicated genes , the order of genes for trnaarg, nd4l, and nd <dig>  may be changed to nd4l, trnaarg, and nd <dig> after complete deletion of redundant genes or pseudogenes . however, if the duplicate pseudogenes retain a functional role in translating overlapping genes, they may not be deleted from the mitogenome, as seen in parrotfish mitochondrial trna pseudogenes that are retained as punctuation marks for mrna processing  <cit> .

in addition, the t. tripolitanus mitogenome may have gone through trna gene reassignment from trnaarg to trnagln by a point mutation at the second anticodon position , although the novel trnagln gene may not be fully functional in translation. mitochondrial trna gene reassignment has been reported in some invertebrates  but, to the best of our knowledge, it is uncommon in vertebrates. together with the finding of trnaglu gene loss in the u. ebenaui mitogenome, these new features should broaden our understanding of the evolution of mitochondrial gene arrangements.
