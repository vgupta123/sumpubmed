BACKGROUND
plants have evolved elaborate defense mechanisms to protect themselves from many kinds of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and insects. defense responses governed by the gene-for-gene hypothesis are triggered in plants when the product of a plant resistance  gene directly or indirectly recognizes a specific pathogen effector molecule, which is often the product of a pathogen avirulence  gene  <cit> . the absence or inactivation of either member of this gene pair results in susceptibility of the host to the pathogen. to date more than  <dig> r genes have been isolated from several plant species, and most of them exhibit highly conserved structures, despite differences between the types of pathogens that are recognized. pathogen recognition by any r protein initiates a common set of defense responses, including the production of reactive oxygen species , expression of pathogen-related  genes, and localized programmed cell death at the site of pathogen challenge, which is known as the hypersensitive response   <cit> . this suggests that common downstream components may be shared by r proteins within and among plant species.

the most prevalent class of plant r proteins contains a nucleotide binding site  and a leucine-rich repeat  region, and are thus called nbs-and-lrr containing  proteins. the nbs domain is a functional atpase and probably regulates the activity of the r proteins  <cit> . the lrr domain is required for specific recognition of the pathogen containing corresponding avirulence gene, and changing even a single amino acid in this region alters its recognition specificity, resulting in disease  <cit> . in addition, there are reports that the n-terminal region of the toll protein and interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain and the putative coiled-coil  domain of some nbs-lrr proteins are involved in specific pathogen recognition  <cit> . genome analyses have revealed that a large number of nbs-lrr genes exist in plant genomes. the arabidopsis and rice genomes contain up to  <dig> and  <dig> nbs-lrr genes, respectively, and many of them are tightly clustered  <cit> .

rice blast, caused by magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most serious diseases of rice world-wide. many r genes against the fungus have been genetically mapped and some of them have been utilized for breeding in rice  <cit> . to date,  <dig> blast r genes have been isolated by map-based cloning, and  <dig> of these encode nbs-lrr resistance proteins  <cit> . the japonica rice cultivar nipponbare  has been selected as a standard cultivar for the international rice genome sequencing project. therefore, nb is a strong tool for the genetic analysis of defense signaling in rice. nb carries r gene-mediated resistance against m. oryzae containing avrpish  <cit> . although the pish locus has been mapped on chromosome  <dig> by an analysis of quantitative trait loci , the gene itself has been difficult to isolate because of it confers only moderate resistance  <cit> . the isolation of r genes from nb is important for the molecular dissection of defense mechanisms mediated by r proteins in rice.

the functional and structural diversification of r genes is crucial for the survival of plants, which must fight off rapidly evolving pathogens. the molecular evolution of r genes is thought to be affected by several mechanisms, including mutations caused by transposable elements . many types of tes have been identified in r gene clusters  <cit> . te-mediated genome reorganization and te-associated methylation may play roles in r-gene evolution, in addition to the actual insertion of tes. therefore, target-site selection by tes is of great interest in the study of r gene evolution. many tes target specific chromosomal sites  <cit> . for some elements, the target sites are determined by specific dna sequences, whereas for others, including several retrotransposons and retroviruses, chromatin structure impacts the choice of target site. the large-scale analysis of sequences flanking the rice retrotransposon tos <dig> indicated that it prefers gene-dense regions over centromeric heterochromatin regions  <cit> .

here we report on our screening approach to identifying signaling components required for r gene-mediated disease resistance, using a collection of nb-background mutant lines generated by activation of the rice endogenous retrotransposon tos <dig>  <cit> . we identified many mutant lines with reduced resistance to m. oryzae containing avrpish. while most of the mutants contained tos <dig> insertions or deletions in the pish gene locus, several contained intact copies of the pish gene. a genome analysis revealed that pish belongs to the nbs-lrr class of r genes, and three highly conserved nbs-lrr genes lie near it. interestingly, this gene cluster is one of the hot spots of tos <dig> insertion, and the target sites are concentrated within the pish locus despite its similarity to the other genes at the sequence and expression levels. this suggests that the preference for tos17-insertion in the pish locus is regulated at the chromatin level.

RESULTS
large scale genetic screening
to efficiently screen for loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding components of disease resistance signal transduction, we used insertion mutant lines of nb in which the endogenous retrotransposon tos <dig> had been activated by tissue culture  <cit> . while nb carries the pish gene  <cit> , cv. kinmaze  does not and is susceptible to the same race of the fungus . to perform high throughput screening, we inoculated  <dig> week-old seedlings with the fungal isolate containing avrpish. in the first screen,  <dig> r <dig> segregating plants per line from  <dig>  mutant lines were inoculated. mutant candidates with susceptible phenotypes  were selected for further screening. in the second screen, about  <dig> plants per selected line were inoculated with the same race of the fungus. we finally identified  <dig> mutant lines with susceptible phenotypes. these mutant lines were subjected to dna gel blot analysis to examine co-segregation of tos <dig> with the mutant phenotype. genomic dna sequences flanking the co-segregating tos <dig> insertions were isolated by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr   <cit> , or by identifying sequence-specific amplification polymorphisms  <cit> . additional flanking sequences were identified by searching the flanking sequence tag  database  <cit> . in cases where no co-segregating signal was obtained, the causative genes will be isolated by a map-based cloning strategy .

isolation of pish mutants
we analyzed in detail two mutant lines, nc <dig> and nc <dig>  and observed the segregation of individuals exhibiting complete susceptibility to the rice blast isolate containing avrpish in the r <dig> population of these lines . the uninfected mutants showed no obvious morphological phenotypes compared with their wild-type siblings . segregants of these lines were screened for the presence of tos <dig> insertions. sixteen and  <dig> newly transposed copies of tos <dig> were detected in the nc <dig> and nc <dig> lines, respectively, in addition to the two original copies . one of the transposed copies  was shown to co-segregate with the susceptible mutant phenotype in each line. genomic sequences flanking the co-segregating tos <dig> copies were amplified by tail-pcr and used as probes on the same membrane. one of the probes hybridized with both the  <dig> -kb band in nc <dig> and the  <dig> -kb band in nc <dig> . because the size of the xbai fragment detected by this probe was  <dig>  kb if tos <dig> was not inserted, the wild-type band was not detected in this analysis. therefore, we carried out a pcr analysis to examine whether the inheritance pattern of the tos <dig> insertion was correlated with the susceptibility phenotype. in all of the susceptible plants, homozygous insertions were detected, as indicated by the amplification of only a smaller fragment assumed to be the product of the tos <dig> specific primer and one of the flanking sequence primers . on the other hand, all of the wild-type siblings were heterozygous or did not contain the insertion. these results strongly suggested that the susceptibility phenotype of the nc <dig> and nc <dig> lines was caused by the tos <dig> insertion, and that the insertional mutation was inherited recessively. a blast search of the genbank nucleotide database and the rice annotation project  database  <cit>  with the flanking sequence revealed that tos <dig> was inserted into the 2nd exon of os01g <dig> in both lines . this gene contains two introns of  <dig> and  <dig> bp. it encodes a predicted polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda, which contains conserved nbs and lrr domain motifs . the nbs domain  contains three sequences, ggagks, llvlddv, and gsrvlvtsrr, which correspond to the conserved kinase 1a , kinase  <dig>  and kinase 3a domains, respectively  <cit> . the c-terminal region of the protein is composed of  <dig> irregular lrrs. further analysis using the paircoil <dig> program  <cit>  revealed a potential cc domain with a threshold of  <dig>  near the n-terminus, indicating the possibility that the encoded protein belongs to the cc-nbs-lrr subclass of r proteins . os01g <dig> is located on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  where pish has been mapped between the markers rm <dig>  and osr <dig>  by qtl analysis  <cit> . taken together, the results suggest that os01g <dig> is pish, and we designated it pish.

isolation of allelic mutants and complementation analysis
to confirm whether the null mutation of pish caused disruption of the resistance mediated by pish, we screened for other allelic mutants among the  <dig> selected mutants from our screening. as expected, most of the mutants  had mutations caused by tos <dig> insertions, deletions, or an unknown insertion in this locus. because these mutant lines were produced by tissue culture and are derived from a relatively small number of induced calli, some of these mutations are shared in multiple independently regenerated plants  <cit> . by considering which calli the mutants were derived from and by examining each mutation pattern , we determined that there are  <dig> independent mutant alleles at the pish locus among the  <dig> mutant lines . of these,  <dig> alleles were caused by tos <dig> insertion. the direction of tos <dig> was not always the same and the insertion sites were dispersed evenly at this locus, suggesting that the insertion site within the locus was random rather than depending on specific dna sequences. nine independent deletion mutations were detected among thirteen lines. the deletion sizes were diverse, ranging from  <dig> bp to over  <dig> kb. one allele in the nd2032/nd2105/nd2452/nd <dig> lines contained an unidentified insert of about  <dig> -kb. in these mutants, the transcription of pish was barely detectable or not detected at all .

b) positions  of tos <dig> insertions relative to the pish atg initiation codon.

on the other hand,  <dig> of the  <dig> lines with diminished pish-mediated resistance contained neither mutations, insertions, nor deletion in this locus . in these mutants, the expression of pish was no different from in the wild type plants . therefore, we concluded that they are not pish mutants and designated them ttm . although we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the ttm mutants have mutations in unknown r genes that correspond to the blast isolate carrying additional avr genes other than avrpish, others are likely to have mutations in components required for activation of pish-mediated disease resistance.

to examine whether pish confer race-specific resistance, we transformed km plants with an empty vector control and a construct containing the pish cdna under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus  <dig> s promoter . we obtained more than five independent transgenic lines for each construct, and used the t <dig> and t <dig> generations for the following analyses. transgenic plants containing the pish construct were as healthy as km plants transformed with the empty vector . when infected with a rice blast isolate containing avrpish, three independent transgenic lines expressing pish exhibited a resistance phenotype, whereas the lines containing the empty vector were susceptible . thus, expression of the pish cdna conferred pish-mediated resistance on km. to determine the resistance spectrum of pish, the transgenic lines were inoculated with seven additional rice blast isolates . as expected, the transgenic km plants containing pish exhibited the same pattern of resistance specificity as the donor cultivar nb. thus, we concluded that pish is the pish gene.

a) the constructs were transformed into the susceptible cultivar km. three independent transgenic lines for each construct were assayed.

b) r: resistance, s: susceptible

expression analysis of pish
quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis was carried out to investigate the expression pattern of pish after infection with various m. oryzae races. the analysis revealed that there were no distinguishable alterations in pish expression levels at different time points after inoculation with either incompatible or compatible races of the fungus, or after mock treatment . this result is consistent with previous reports that other pi genes were constitutively expressed and not induced by pathogen challenge  <cit> . it is likely that most pi genes are expressed before pathogen invasion and are post-transcriptionally regulated for activation of the signal transduction pathways leading to resistance responses.

the genomic organization in the pish region
pish  is present on the long-arm of chromosome  <dig>  the rap database revealed that three other nbs-lrr genes  are arranged as tandem repeats near pish within a 55-kb interval . an allele of os01g <dig> in the rice cv. st. no. <dig> encodes the r protein pi <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we named the genes npi37- <dig>  npi37- <dig> and npi37- <dig>  their deduced amino acid sequences show  <dig>   <dig>  and 98% similarity, respectively, to pish . npi37- <dig> shows the highest similarity to pish, with differences at only  <dig> residues in the lrr domain .

the amino acid sequences of the four nbs-lrr proteins were compared with each other using clustalw http://www <dig> ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/.

the pish gene cluster is a hot spot of tos <dig> insertions
in this screening, we obtained  <dig> independent mutant alleles of pish that were caused by tos <dig> insertions. this suggested the possibility that the pish locus is a hot spot of tos <dig> insertions. it has been reported that tos <dig> insertions are not distributed randomly in the rice genome, and several hot spots have been identified in nb, including genes encoding protein kinases and disease/defense-related genes  <cit> . an in silico analysis of the fst database revealed that  <dig>  sequences flanking tos <dig> insertion sites were present within the 55-kb genomic region including the four nbs-lrr genes . these flanking sequences were particularly concentrated  within a region of about 47-kb that includes npi37- <dig>  npi37- <dig>  and pish, but not the npi37- <dig> locus. based on the original callus lines and the sites of insertion, we determined that  <dig> of these insertions were independent. we also examined the 50-kb regions on either side of the 55-kb region. even though each of these regions contains six predicted genes, the tos <dig> insertions were highly concentrated in three of the four nbs-lrr genes , indicating that these genes constitute a hot spot for tos <dig> insertion. the four genes npi37- <dig>  npi37- <dig>  npi37- <dig>  and pish contain highly similar sequences, and the sequences derived from fst are very short. therefore, it was difficult to identify the exact site of each tos <dig> insertion based on the fst sequences. to explore this further we randomly selected  <dig> independent insertions from the database and identified the insertion sites for  <dig> of them by pcr using specific primers. unexpectedly, most of them were concentrated in either npi37- <dig> or pish. more than half of the insertions  were detected in the pish gene, and  <dig> of  <dig>  were in npi37- <dig> . on the other hand, only two insertions were found in npi37- <dig> and none were found in the npi37- <dig> locus. this is surprising given that the npi37- <dig> dna sequence is 93% and 92% identical to those of npi37- <dig> and pish, respectively. tos <dig> is activated by tissue culture, and we therefore speculated that the frequency of the insertion in a particular gene may depend on its expression level in cultured cells. to test this possibility, we analyzed the expression levels of each of the nbs-lrr genes in cultured cells. rt-pcr analysis demonstrated that the transcript levels of these four genes were not significantly different from one another . these results suggest that neither gene structure nor relative expression levels are sufficient to explain the location of this hot spot.

the fst database also demonstrated that no tos <dig> insertions occurred in the intergenic regions within this 55-kb genomic region . the intergenic regions between npi37- <dig> and npi37- <dig>  and between npi37- <dig> and pish  are each more than  <dig> kb in length and show high levels of sequence similarity because of their duplication. an investigation of the intergenic regions using the repeatmasker  <cit>  program demonstrated that many ancient retrotransposon and other te sequences are present in ig <dig> and ig <dig> . in addition, a search of the rice mpss database  <cit>  indicated that the target sites of many small rnas  are present in ig <dig> and ig <dig> . it is possible that these te sequences constitute micro-heterochromatic regions due to the accumulation of these srna target sites. because tos <dig> insertions occur more frequently in gene-dense regions than in heterochromatin at the chromosomal level, this may explain why we found no tos <dig> insertion in these intergenic regions.

discussion
large-scale screening using the retrotransposon tos <dig> in rice
we screened  <dig>  mutant lines induced by the rice retrotransposon tos <dig> with the goal of obtaining signal components required for disease resistance in rice. this mutant population is estimated to carry over  <dig>  insertions, based on our previous reports that the average number of insertions per line is about  <dig>  <cit> . we estimated that  <dig>  insertions are required to provide a 99% chance of finding a mutant of any one gene  <cit> . furthermore, since the lines were derived from cultured cells, they were expected to contain many deletions and substitutions . thus the number of mutant lines we employed here should have been enough for the identification of signaling mutants by genetic screening.

among the mutations isolated by this screen, loss-of-function alleles of pish were the most abundant. these mutants were easy to distinguish from wild-type plants because they exhibited complete susceptibility to a m. oryzae isolate containing avrpish. on the other hand, since the strength of resistance mediated by pish is moderate, it was difficult to identify other mutations that caused reductions in resistance rather than a complete collapse in resistance. another reason for the abundance of pish mutations in our screen is that the pish locus is one of the hot spots for tos <dig> insertions . therefore, it might have been inevitable that we would obtain a lot of pish mutants. the finding that most of the mutations isolated were loss-of-function alleles of an r gene is consistent with previous reports of screens for disease resistance mutations in arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and barley  <cit> . in arabidopsis, tornero and colleagues recovered  <dig> mutants that exhibited no hr after avrrpm <dig> induction, and  <dig> of them were loss-of-function mutations in the r gene rpm <dig>  which confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato expressing the avrrpm <dig> gene  <cit> . jørgensen and colleagues performed a mutant screening of barley and isolated over  <dig> loss-of-function alleles of the mla <dig> gene, which confers resistance to powdery mildew, and only three additional mutants in two other loci   <cit> . thus, our ratio of  <dig> pish mutant lines to  <dig> other mutations was not surprising. the other  <dig> mutant lines have not yet been characterized, however, we expect that the analysis and isolation of the causative genes may provide novel insights into disease resistance signaling in rice.

an nbs-lrr gene cluster in the pish region
genome sequencing revealed that there are up to  <dig> nbs-lrr genes in the rice genome and they account for about 1% of all of predicted orfs  <cit> . the majority of r genes in the nbs-lrr class are physically clustered with closely related genes  <cit> . we found three additional nbs-lrr genes near pish, arranged as tandem repeats . although one of these  exhibits high similarity to pish, with differences at only  <dig> residues in the lrr domain, it does not confer resistance to m. oryzae containing avrpish . it is likely that some of these  <dig> residues are important for maintaining the target recognition site of pish. this is consistent with reports that the lrr domain is required for the specific recognition of avirulence factors directly or indirectly, and that mutations in this domain often change gene-for-gene specificities  <cit> . on the other hand, the nbs domain may also be involved in the specific recognition of the target factors. npi37- <dig> is an allele of another r gene, pi <dig>  <cit> . the only difference between them is in two amino acid residues  in the nbs domain . as discussed previously  <cit> , these substitutions in the nbs domain are presumably involved in avrpi <dig> recognition.

pi <dig> was identified in a qtl analysis of a population derived from the japonica rice cultivar hokkai  <dig> and the indica rice cultivar danghang-shali. the gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> between the ssr markers rm <dig> and rm <dig>  and is closely linked with pish  <cit> . interestingly, the resistance conferred by pi <dig> to m. oryzae is classified as partial resistance  rather than true resistance . although the race specificity and defense strength of pi <dig> is different from that of pish, it is possible that pi <dig> is allelic to either pish or pi <dig>  if so, the region containing the pish locus is one of the clusters of r genes in rice. this is consistent with the idea that the evolution of r genes is driven by selection of allelic variations created by mutations or recombination within these clusters. this phenomenon has also been observed in the case of other r gene clusters such as the one containing pi <dig>  pi <dig> and piz-t on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the identification and characterization of pi <dig> will allow us to understand the difference between partial and true resistance at the molecular level, and will also shed light on the evolution of these r genes during rice domestication.

evolution of the pish gene cluster
classical genetics and genome analysis have demonstrated that r genes tend to be clustered. the 55-kb region containing the pish locus contains three other nbs-lrr genes, all oriented in the same direction . among the proteins encoded by these genes, npi37- <dig> exhibits little similarity to the other three, while npi37- <dig> shows high similarity to npi37- <dig>  and pish  . intriguingly, the n-terminal half of npi37- <dig> is identical to that of pish and the other half is identical to that of npi37- <dig> . these data suggest that at first the ancestral nbs-lrr gene was duplicated to produce npi37- <dig> and npi37-2-pre. this would be followed by a second duplication event in which npi37-2-pre was duplicated to produce npi37- <dig> and pish. more recently, a crossover and/or duplication presumably occurred between npi37- <dig> and pish, resulting in npi37- <dig>  npi37- <dig>  and pish. npi37- <dig> and pish are identical between the cultivars nb and st. no. <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that the two paralogs, npi37- <dig> and npi37- <dig>  probably mutated independently in nb and/or st. no. <dig> after the duplication events described above.

how did these frequent gene duplications in the pish region occur? although r gene loci in general tend to be duplicated, the mechanism for this duplication remains obscure. gene duplication is sometimes caused by the misrepair of chromosomal double-strand breaks , which arise spontaneously during the life of a cell. one possible inducer of dsbs is the endonuclease activity encoded by tes. in drosphila melanogaster, it has been reported that dsbs are important triggers of segmental duplication , and the distribution of sds correlates positively with that of tes  <cit> . here we showed that the pish locus is one of the hot spots for tos <dig> insertions . therefore, the pish locus was presumably attacked frequently by the tos <dig> endonuclease, resulted in dsbs, which might have caused gene duplication. in addition to this effect of endonuclease activity, the insertion of tes is thought to be important for the molecular evolution of r genes. actually, many types of tes have been identified in r gene clusters  <cit> . recently, hayashi and yoshida  <cit>  reported that the insertion of a retrotransposon renovator in the promoter region of the blast r gene pit promoted its expression and reactivation, demonstrating that the insertion of tes has contributed to r gene evolution.

our results indicating that the pish locus is a hot spot for tos <dig> insertions is consistent with a previous report that disease resistance genes are among the preferred targets for tos <dig> insertion  <cit> . however, the disease resistance genes annotated in the report were predicted from their dna sequence similarity with sequences encoding nbs and/or lrr domains, therefore there was no direct evidence indicating they truly function as r genes or components of defense signaling. here, we demonstrated that the functional r gene pish is actually a hot spot of tos <dig> insertion in the nb genome, and is the preferred target site among four highly conserved and closely linked nbs-lrr genes, even though the genes are highly similar at both the nucleotide sequence and expression levels. these results suggest that tos <dig> inserts most frequently in functional genes within hot spot regions. a search of the fst database indicates that not all nbs-lrr gene loci are hot spots for tos <dig> insertion. it is possible that the nbs-lrr gene loci that are hot spots for te insertions are functional r genes that have not yet been identified. thus, it may be possible to predict novel functional r genes in the fst database by looking for regions that are hot spots for te insertions. this possibility should be assessed in the future.

the molecular mechanisms that determine te integration site specificity in plants are still unknown. studies of the ty retrotransposons of yeast have revealed that interactions with bound chromosomal proteins can tether the ty integration machinery to chromosomes and thereby direct integration to nearby sites  <cit> . the human immunodeficiency virus  integrates preferentially into actively transcribed genes at sites with transcription-associated histone modifications. therefore, it is possible that the insertion of tos <dig> is regulated by chromatin structure or through interaction with chromatin binding proteins, rather than being controlled directly by the structures or expression levels of the targeted sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
the genetic screening described here was a high-throughput system that allowed us to identify several mutants involved in r gene-mediated signal transduction and also to isolate the r gene pish. we are confident that these mutants will be useful tools for the genetic analysis of defense signaling mechanism downstream of an r gene. furthermore, our data provided experimental evidence that an r gene cluster is a highly preferred target for te insertions. our observations raise the hypothesis that recurrent gene duplication during the evolution of the pish locus depended on this unique feature of being a preferred target site of tos <dig> insertion. further studies of the pish locus will provide new insights into the functional and structural diversification of r genes, which is crucial for the survival of plants in their fight against rapidly evolving pathogens.
