BACKGROUND
salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses for plants in the world. high concentrations of sodium in soils are deleterious to the growth and development of non-halophytes. global crop production is affected by salinity stress and this problem is becoming more and more serious  <cit> . most of the major crops are salt-sensitive and irrigation-induced soil salinization causes the lost of large tracts of agricultural land  <cit> . it is important to study the salt-tolerance mechanisms to improve crop plants.

arabidopsis  has been considered an excellent model system for determining molecular pathways in plants since its genome was sequenced in  <dig>  in the past ten years it has been used extensively to investigate salt tolerance in plants  <cit> . however, as a true glycophyte, it is difficult for arabidopsis to survive at even moderate salinity . studying only arabidopsis could not provide enough information on salt-tolerant mechanisms. thellungiella halophila is a salt-tolerant close relative of arabidopsis that has been considered a model system for studying salt tolerance in plants  <cit> . because of the high similarity between these two species at the cdna level , the resources of arabidopsis such as gene and protein information can be used to study t. halophila. furthermore, t. halophila shared several advantages with arabidopsis. it has a small genome, a short life cycle, enough seed production and can easily be transformed  <cit> . interestingly, these two species have obvious differences in stress-tolerance while sharing high similarity in cdna sequences. this may due to differences in the gene regulatory regions between these two species  <cit> . therefore, it is important to study the promoter sequences of t. halophila to discover how they differ from those of arabidopsis.

strong constitutive promoters, such as the camv 35s promoter and the maize ubiquitin gene promoter  <cit> , have been widely used in transgenic plants to express foreign genes. however, it may be harmful to express a foreign gene constitutively in host plants. this may lead to sterility, delayed development, abnormal morphology, yield loss, changes in grain composition or transgene silencing  <cit> . to solve this problem, a strong tissue-specific or inducible promoter can be used to restrict gene expression to only the required tissue or at a specific time. arabidopsis promoters rd29a and rd29b were found to response to multiple stresses including high salinity, drought, cold and aba  <cit> . then with the development of cdna microarray technology and sequencing of the arabidopsis genome, many stress inducible genes were identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . in addition, a large number of tissue-specific or inducible genes and their promoters have been identified from other species  <cit> . however, there has been no report of a promoter that responds to salt stress particularly in the root tips.

vacuolar h+-pyrophosphatase  genes play an important role in abiotic-stress tolerance. transgenic plants overexpressing the vacuolar h+-pyrophosphatase gene avp <dig> from arabidopsis are much more resistant to high concentrations of nacl and to water deprivation than wild-type strains  <cit> . gao et al. cloned a novel h+-ppase gene named tsvp <dig> from thellungiella halophila. the heterologous expression of tsvp <dig> or avp <dig> in yeast mutant ena <dig> partly restored its salt tolerance  <cit> . heterologous expression of tsvp <dig> in tobacco also improved its salt tolerance  <cit> . although they have a similar function in salt tolerance, these two genes had different expression pattern under salinity stress. when treated with  <dig> mm nacl solution, tsvp <dig> expression increased 3-fold in the aerial roots and 5-fold in the roots during the first  <dig> h. but avp <dig> expression was not changed  <cit> . thus, there must be some differences between the promoter regions of these two homologous genes.

in this report we cloned and analyzed the promoter regions of the tsvp <dig> and avp <dig> genes. in transgenic arabidopsis, the gus reporter gene driven by the tsvp <dig> promoter was obviously induced under salt stress, especially in the root tips. however, the gus gene driven by the avp <dig> promoter was not changed under salt stress. by analyzing the sequences and a series of deletion mutants, we identified a  <dig> bp region from the tsvp <dig> promoter which may be the key sequence for responding to salt stress.

RESULTS
cloning the promoters from tsvp <dig> and avp1
a pair of primers, ptsvp-up and ptsvp-down was designed for primary screening of the thellungiella halophila genomic library. the pcr products were dig-labeled and then used for the subsequent in situ hybridization. a positive clone containing the upstream sequence of the tsvp <dig> gene was isolated and sequenced. the intergenic region between tsvp <dig> and the next upstream gene was  <dig> bp and the fragment beginning at - <dig> bp upstream of the tsvp <dig> translational initiation site was taken as the full-length promoter. the genomic sequences around gene avp <dig> were obtained from tair. the intergenic region between avp <dig> and the next upstream gene was  <dig> bp and the sequence - <dig> bp from the translational initiation site was considered to be the full-length promoter. this fragment was amplified from arabidopsis genomic dna and sequenced.

sequence bioinformatics analysis
the regulatory elements in these two promoters were analyzed using online software place and plantcare. in the tsvp <dig> promoter  <dig> kinds of putative cis-elements responding to heat, light, drought, meja, salicylic acid, aba and stress induction were identified . in the avp <dig> promoter there were also  <dig> kinds of putative cis-elements responding to heat, light, gibberellin, meja, salicylic acid, aba, cold and auxin stimulation . although these sequences shared about 75% similarity, these two promoters contained only seven similar regulatory elements at similar positions . reported known high salinity inducible cis-elements were not found in these two promoters although tsvp <dig> gene expression was obviously induced under salt stress.

construction of promoter-reporter plasmids and plant transformation
to compare the activities of these two promoters and determine the key sequences of the tsvp <dig> promoter, a set of reporter constructs were made by linking various lengths of the tsvp <dig> regulatory regions to the uida reporter gene encoding Î²-glucuronidase  in the vector pcambia1391z . the full-length avp <dig> promoter was also linked to the uida reporter gene . in addition to these constructs, vector pcambia <dig> was used as a positive control while vector pcambia1391z was used as a negative control. these promoter constructs were analyzed using an arabidopsis system since it has high transformation efficiency and there is a large amount of similarity between these two species. it was reported that cloned promoters usually retain their native expression patterns when transformed into related species  <cit> . in addition, arabidopsis has been extensively used for promoter analysis from a wide variety of plant species.

following transformation of these constructs into arabidopsis, over  <dig> independent homozigous, single-copy transformants were obtained and analyzed using gus histochemical staining and gus enzymatic activity quantification for each construct.

characterization of the full-length tsvp <dig> promoter activity in arabidopsis
histochemical staining of transgenic plants where gus expression was driven by the full-length tsvp <dig> promoter yielded a whole-plant perspective of the promoter activity. gus expression was present in leaves, roots, stems, flowers and silique pods, but not in the seeds . in 10-day old arabidopsis plants, strong gus expression was present throughout the whole plant . in the flowers, gus expression was also detected with an uneven distribution. gus activity was much higher in the vascular tissue than in the other parts of the sepals and petals. in the stamens, gus activity was more intense in the anthers than the filaments. in the pistils, gus staining was detected mainly in the upper portion, especially in the stigma . in the siliques, gus expression was present in the pods but not in the inside seeds .

after treatment with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> hours, gus activity in the 10-day old pt <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants was observably induced in the roots, especially in the root tips . because of the original high expression levels of this promoter in the leaves, it was difficult to see a change in expression levels in the leaves just by staining. to see the full-length tsvp <dig> promoter expression pattern and to find the exact gus activity changes after salt stress, we measured gus activity in different parts of the plants from transgenic lines pt <dig> under normal and salt stress conditions . gus activity was much higher in the roots and leaves than in other parts of the plants under normal conditions. with salt stress treatment, gus activity in the roots and leaves was induced about threefold, while gus activity was only slightly changed in the other parts of the plants .

the transgenic lines pa <dig> in which the gus gene was driven by the full-length avp <dig> promoter was also analyzed as a comparison. they had strong gus activity throughout the whole plants under normal conditions. this was similar to pt <dig>  but after treatment with salt stress, no visible induction of pa <dig> was found by gus staining . this was different from pt <dig>  for the positive and negative controls, strong gus activity was found in the p35s transgenic lines while no gus activity was found in 1391z.

we also measured the gus activity in different tissues in pa <dig> and p35s plants under normal and salt stress conditions in the adult plants . the result indicated that gus activity in pa <dig> and p35s was not induced by salt stress. under normal conditions, pt <dig> and pa <dig> had similar levels of gus expression to p35s. but after treatment with salt stress, pt <dig> had a higher level of gus activity than pa <dig> and p35s in the leaves and roots .

characterization of the activity from the 5' deleted promoter fragments in arabidopsis
to identify the key regions of this promoter, we created eight 5' deletion mutants as shown in figure  <dig>  these constructs were introduced into arabidopsis and a number of independent homozigous, single-copy transformants were obtained each construct.

transgenic line pt <dig> lacks the  <dig> bp region , and had obviously reduced activity compared to pt <dig> . in pt <dig> plants, gus activity was detected mainly in the vascular tissue, especially in leaves . in the flowers gus staining was only found in the anthers . for transgenic lines pt <dig> to pt <dig>  a similar gus expression pattern was detected both in the 10-day old plants and the adult plants. no obvious differences were found among these lines. pt <dig> had a similar expression level to pt <dig> except for the anther specific expression in flowers. in the floral tissue of transgenic line pt <dig>  anther specific expression of gus no longer existed. instead plants of this line had weak gus expression in the vascular parts of sepals and filaments. there was also weak gus activity in the upper part of the pistil . for pt <dig> and pt <dig>  there was a similar expression pattern in the flowers compared with pt <dig>  but weaker gus expression in leaves and roots than pt <dig>  pt <dig> and pt <dig> only had basal expression in the vascular tissue, both in the shoots and roots . all of the constructs from pt <dig> to pt <dig> had a similar faint staining in the silique. in the petiole only very weak gus expression was present. no visible staining was found in the other parts of the silique .

we also measured the gus activity in different tissues of pt <dig> to pt <dig> plants under normal conditions in the adult plants . the result clearly indicated that pt <dig> plants had an obviously reduced activity in all tissues than pt <dig>  for pt <dig> to pt <dig>  they had a similar expression pattern except the flowers. pt <dig> had a reduced activity in flowere than pt <dig>  pt <dig> and pt <dig> had a lower activity than pt <dig>  especially in leaves and roots .

a  <dig> bp region was identified as the key region for responding to salt stress
to identify the specific region in the tsvp <dig> promoter involved in the salt stress response, all the 5' deleted constructs were analyzed in transgenic arabidopsis by gus staining both with and without salt stress. after treatment with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> hours, transgenic line pt <dig> had induced gus activity in both the leaves and roots . gus activity was strongly induced in the root tips . this was the same as the pt <dig> transgenic lines where the gus gene was driven by the full-length tsvp <dig> promoter . in addition, because the gus activity in pt <dig> was much weaker than pt <dig> in the leaves, the induction of gus activity was visible in the pt <dig> leaves . as mentioned above, pt <dig> and pt <dig> had similar levels of gus activity under normal conditions. when treated with salt stress, these lines still had similar gus expression patterns. gus activity was obviously induced both in the shoots and roots in these transgenic lines, especially in the root tips . but this induction disappeared in pt <dig> , in which the gus gene was driven by the promoter region from - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the translational initiate site. there was no salt stress induction of gus activity found in pt <dig> either . comparing the promoter regions upstream from the gus gene in the constructs pt <dig> and pt <dig>  pt <dig> had  <dig> bp region  that was deleted from pt <dig>  this is the reason why gus activity was induced by salt-stress in pt <dig> but not in pt <dig> 

the  <dig> bp region was sufficient for the salt stress response
to check if the  <dig> bp region  identified in the tsvp <dig> promoter was sufficient for the salt stress response, we incorporated this  <dig> bp region with a minimal camv35s promoter  to produce the promoter of p-130-mini35s and detected its activity under normal and salt stress conditions by agrobacterium-mediated gus transient assay in tobacco leaves . the p-130-mini35s had a near two-fold activity in comparison with the minimal camv35s promoter under normal condition. when treated by salt stress, the activity of the p-130-mini35s increased to about three-fold level, while the activity of the minimal camv35s promoter was not changed .

gus staining of the tobacco leaves was also carried out. the leaves infiltrated with the minimal camv35s::gus construct had only a very weak staining under both normal and salt stress conditions . the leaves infiltrated with the p-130-mini35s::gus construct had a higher gus activity than p-mini35s under normal condition and its gus activity was obviously induced by salt stress . these results indicated that the  <dig> bp region  was sufficient for the salt stress response.

the constructs 1391z and p35s were also used in this experiment as controls. the leaves infiltrated with 1391z had no gus activity while the leaves infiltrated with p35s had a very strong gus activity .

bioinformatic analysis of the  <dig> bp region
the  <dig> bp region  was analyzed using bioinformatics. first we searched for the known motifs present in this region with the online software plnatcare and place. four motifs including a g-box, a cgcta-box, a box-iii and a tc-rich element were found in this region . no reported salt response motif was found in this region. in addition, although there was a different expression pattern under salt stress, the promoter sequences of the tsvp <dig> and avp <dig> promoters had about 75% similarity. when we compared this sequence to the related sequence from the avp <dig> promoter, a  <dig> bp region  in the avp <dig> promoter was found as the corresponding sequence to the identified  <dig> bp region in the tsvp <dig> promoter . motif searching revealed that there was only one motif, a tca-element functioning in the salicylic acid response in this  <dig> bp region in avp <dig> promoter. interestingly, none of the four motifs found in the  <dig> bp region from the tsvp <dig> promoter was present in the  <dig> bp region from the avp <dig> promoter. this result again demonstrated that there were differences between these two promoters.

discussion
previous studies have shown that arabidopsis contains most, if not all of the salt tolerance genes one might find in halophytes. it was hypothesized that the large variations in salt tolerance or sensitivity among arabidopsis and other halophytes was because of subtle differences in gene regulation  <cit> . in our previous work, it was discovered that tsvp <dig> and avp <dig> have different expression patterns under salt stress, although they have similar functions in salt-tolerance both in yeast and tobacco  <cit> . to investigate the reason, we cloned and analyzed the promoters of these two genes. to our surprise, these two promoter sequences shared about 75% sequence similarity . we then did bioinformatic analysis of these two promoters. as we expected, the cis-acting motifs present in these two promoters were not similar. they only shared seven identical regulatory elements at similar positions . our results indicated that there were certain differences between these two genes in their regulation.

to study these two promoters in detail, we constructed promoter-reporter vectors and transformed arabidopsis. all the transgenic plants were analyzed to understand the expression patterns of different promoter fragments. for the full-length tsvp <dig> promoter, the activity was as strong as the well known promoter camv 35s under normal conditions. after under salt stress, this promoter had even stronger activity in the roots and leaves .

in figure 3a we can see that pt <dig>  pa <dig> and p35s all caused stronger activity in roots and leaves than in other parts of the plant. this indicated that pt <dig> and pa <dig> had full-length promoter activity and also suggested that the constitutive promoter camv 35s had different activity in different tissues. some previous work also found that the widely used promoter camv 35s produced different levels of activity in different stages or different organs  <cit> . pt <dig> and pa <dig> had similar expression patterns in the absence of salt stress, but after salt stress, pt <dig> had obviously induced activity in the roots and leaves. this was consistent with our previous work  <cit> .

along with the development of plant genetic engineering, transgenic safety was also seriously considered. for most crops, the seeds are the final product that we use. thus, it is important to protect the seeds from potential contaminating foreign genes. in our work we found that promoter pt <dig> had strong activity in almost every tissue except the seeds. this would be useful for its application in crop genetic engineering.

in the 5' deleted mutants, pt <dig> lacked a  <dig> bp region , and had obviously reduced activity compared to pt <dig>  we would expect one or more enhancers to be present in the - <dig> to - <dig> region. bioinformatic analysis identified  <dig> putative cis-elements in this region . these elements included nine light responsive elements , two protein binding sites , a motif named hd-zip <dig> associated with palisade mesophyll cells, an anaerobic induction responding element are, a drought responsive element mbs, a aba responsive site abre and a heat stress responsive element hse. no reported enhancer was detected in this region. further study of this region is important to identify the minimum enhancer region.

in addition, pt <dig> showed an anther specific pattern of expression in the flowers. this expression pattern was also detected in deletion mutants pt <dig> to pt <dig> but not in pt <dig> to pt <dig>  mitsuda et al. had studied the avp <dig> promoter in detail and also found its pollen specific profile  <cit> . they identified a  <dig> bp region within which there was an aaatga sequence motif that had been identified in the regulatory region of the pollen-specific tobacco ntp <dig> gene  <cit> . in the tsvp <dig> promoter, two aaatga sequence motifs were also found at the position - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  both of these two positions was located in the promoter regions of deletion mutants pt <dig> to pt <dig>  but only one aaatga motif was present in the promoter region of pt <dig>  there were no aaatga motifs in pt <dig> to pt <dig>  this result indicated that the aaatga motif may be the key sequence for the anther specific expression pattern in flowers and only one aaatga motif could drive the expression profile. there should be some other elements in the - <dig> to - <dig> region to drive the gene expression in other parts of the flower, so the pt <dig> plants did not have an anther specific expression profile in the flowers.

gus expression was induced in both the leaves and the roots in pt <dig> under salt stress conditions. it was very interesting that the induction in the root tips was so intense . root tips are important parts of plants. they are the main regions for water and mineral uptake and gas exchange. changing the gene expression levels in the root tips seems a meaningful way to engineer plants. many stress inducible genes and their promoters have been identified  <cit> . in addition, some root specific promoters were also identified. vijaybhaskar et al. identified a root-specific promoter from a glycosyltransferase gene of arabidopsis  <cit> . simon et al. identified a near root specific gene farb <dig> from strawberries and analyzed its promoter activity  <cit> . schunmann et al. identified a promoter region controlling the root expression and phosphate deprivation response  <cit> . kobayashi et al. identified two novel cis-acting elements, ide <dig> and ide <dig>  from the barley ids <dig> gene promoter, which confer iron-deficiency-inducible, root-specific expression in heterogeneous tobacco plants  <cit> . however, no promoter has been reported that was obviously induced in the root tips by salt stress. in this work we first report that the tsvp <dig> promoter can produce significant gene expression induction in the root tips by salt stress. this may supply new material for the genetic improvement of crops.

analysis of the 5' deleted mutants under salt stress conditions revealed a  <dig> bp sequence  in the tsvp <dig> promoter that may be the key region for responding to salinity. agrobacterium-mediated gus transient assay in tobacco leaves suggested that this  <dig> bp region was sufficient for the salt stress response. there were four cis-elements present in this region . a g-box is a well-studied element that functions in the light response. the cgcta-box was reported to be involved in meja-responsiveness. the box-iii was identified as a protein binding site and the tc-rich repeats may respond for defense and stress. it is possible that the tc-rich repeats may play a crucial role in this region because of their ability to respond for defense and stress  <cit> . this region may also contain a new element that is crucial for salt responding. further research on this region, such as identifying the minimal key element in this region and the protein which plays an important role in the regulation of this promoter will be meaningful to reveal the salt-tolerant mechanism of thellungiella halophila.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we cloned and analyzed the promoter of the salt inducible gene tsvp <dig> from thellungiella halophila. it has as strong activity as the well-used promoter camv 35s in leaves, roots, stems and flowers. but no promoter activity was detected in the seeds. this was exciting for its application in crop engineering.

as we predicted, the activity of the tsvp <dig> promoter was obviously induced by salt stress while the avp <dig> promoter was not. this indicated that there was difference in gene regulation between these two genes. and we also found that the induction of the tsvp <dig> promoter activity in roots was mainly in the root tips. thinking of the important roles the root tips play, this result showed that it was meaningful to use the tsvp <dig> promoter in crop engineering. by analysis of different 5' deleted mutant, a  <dig> bp sequence  of tsvp <dig> promoter was identified which may be the key region for its salt responsive ability. gus transient analysis revealed that the  <dig> bp region was sufficient for the salt stress response. bioinformatic analysis revealed that there may be novel motifs responding to salt stress exist in this region.
