BACKGROUND
most cellular processes are carried out by multiprotein complexes that constitute important functional units in the cell  <cit> . this fact has motivated a number of studies aiming to investigate the structure, function and evolution of such multisubunit molecular machines .

a cellular process in which protein complexes are known to be involved is the transport of proteins between cellular compartments   <cit> . proteins synthesised in the secretory pathway are transported inside vesicles that move from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus, from where polypeptides are then sorted to several cellular compartments  <cit> . as progression through the golgi occurs, proteins may undergo modifications like glycosylation, a necessary step for their stability and function  <cit> . several large protein complexes play an important role in the fidelity of vesicle fusion, acting as tethering factors through the formation of physical links between membranes prior to fusion  <cit> . one of these is the conserved oligomeric golgi  complex  <cit> , which localizes at the cytoplasmic surface of the golgi apparatus  <cit> .

several studies have been performed demonstrating the involvement of cog in retrograde vesicular trafficking of golgi resident proteins  <cit> , including enzymes that participate in glycans biosyntesis  <cit> . consequently, cog impairment results in abnormal golgi morphology  and function . however, its precise mechanism of action is not completely understood.

cog complex is composed by eight distinct subunits  <cit> , cog <dig> to cog <dig>  arranged in two lobes consisting of cog <dig> to cog <dig>  and cog <dig> to cog <dig>   <cit> . although several models have been advanced refining the architecture of cog  <cit> , the most recent studies converge in suggesting that mammalian cog members are organized in two heterotrimeric groups, cog2-cog3-cog <dig> and cog5-cog6-cog <dig>  which are linked by the dimeric group formed by cog <dig> and cog <dig>  in particular, cog <dig> associates with cog2-cog3-cog <dig>  whereas cog <dig> interacts with cog5-cog6-cog <dig>   <cit> .

previous studies have shown the possibility that cog components have different roles within the complex, since mutations or deletion of individual subunits cause sharply distinct phenotypes  <cit> . in yeast, the deletion of any one of the four lobe a subunits causes a severe growth defect, whilst disruption of the remaining genes  does not substantially interfere with normal cell growth  <cit> . in mammals, cog1- and cog2-deficient cells present several dilated cisternae  <cit>  and pleiotropic defects in the synthesis of n-, o- and lipid-linked glycans  <cit> . a similar phenotype is observed in cog5-deficient cells, although the alterations in glycosylation are subtle  <cit> . in addition, cog <dig> depletion entails the accumulation of vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm  <cit> . more recently, cog dysfunction caused by mutations in specific subunits has been associated with new forms of congenital disorders of glycosylation  in humans .

in the present study, we used a broad range of comparative sequence analyses to track the evolutionary profile of this complex in vertebrates.

methods
in silico orthologs retrieval
human protein sequences corresponding to each cog subunit  were retrieved from the national center for biotechnology information   <cit> . these sequences were used as queries to search orthologous proteins from the reference proteins database  using the blastp algorithm  <cit> , with an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig> and using the reciprocal best-hit approach  <cit> . alternatively, sequences were retrieved from ensembl genome browser  <cit> , release  <dig> from march  <dig>  via the orthogues option. available sequences from the following taxa were considered in this study: mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians  and fishes . cog <dig> from g. aculeatus, cog <dig> from x. tropicalis and cog <dig> from d. rerio were assembled based on the genomic sequence through the comparison with the orthologous protein from other species, and through tblastn searches on ests database. accession numbers are available in the additional file  <dig>  in addition, due to probable assembling errors, residues  <dig> to  <dig> from p. troglodytes cog <dig>  residues  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> from p. pygmaeus cog <dig> as well as residues  <dig> to  <dig> from m. mulatta cog <dig> were replaced by missing data.

protein distances
protein sequences were aligned with muscle  <cit>  and manually refined by removing sites at which all sequences except one or two have alignment gaps. additionally, the initial and terminal regions of the multiple sequences alignment had, in some cases, to be removed because they were poorly aligned. this step was particularly important in cog <dig> and cog <dig>  the final alignments of each group of orthologous sequences are available at additional file  <dig>  protein distances were calculated using protdist from phylip  <dig>  package  <cit> , with the jones-taylor-thornton  evolutionary model and gamma distribution of rates with a fixed shape parameter of  <dig>  divergence times between species were obtained with timetree  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis and dn/ds  ratios
to reconstruct species phylogeny, the protein-coding sequences were aligned with clustalw program  <cit>  implemented in bioedit version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> , using protein alignments as template to avoid out-of-frame gaps. the poorly aligned positions and divergent regions in each alignment were eliminated with gblocks program  <cit>  and the resulting blocks were concatenated in a single alignment of  <dig> positions. to identify the model of nucleotide substitution that best fits the data the akaike information criterion  was applied, using the jmodeltest  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the selected model  was used to reconstruct the maximum likelihood phylogeny in phyml  <dig>   <cit> . the tree was drawn with figtree program  <cit> . the resulting tree topology, but not branch lengths, was used to fit different models in paml.

the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous sites  have been estimated with codeml from the paml v. <dig>  package  <cit> , using the f <dig> ×  <dig> codon frequency model and treating alignment gaps as ambiguity characters . the input alignments were modified by removing positions that showed evidence to represent true indels, while keeping those that appear to be missing data. alignments are available in additional file  <dig>  several models that allow for different levels of heterogeneity in the dn/ds ratio  among lineages have been applied: the one-ratio model that assumes the same ω ratio for all branches in the phylogeny; the free-ratios model that allows ω to vary on every lineage; and the two-ratio model, which assumes that the branch of interest has an ω value  different from the ratio of the other lineages . the above models can be compared using a likelihood ratio test  to test different hypothesis, as described by yang  <cit> . because synonymous sites saturation prevents comparisons of too divergent sequences, only species from humans to birds were considered in this analysis.

expression analyses
expressed sequence tag  profiles from several human and murine tissue samples were extracted for cog genes from the unigene database  <cit>  as est counts per million transcripts and were log <dig> transformed . a number of erroneously assigned ests for human and mouse cog <dig> were manually removed. for simplicity, only homologous tissues for which information was available in both organisms were included, resulting in a total of  <dig> tissues. the clusters on the heatmaps were made by an in house tool, using correlation as the measure of similarity.

in addition, because in several tissues some cog genes have no detectable expression , we have further tested the presence of all cog transcripts in  <dig> different human tissues included in a rna panel obtained from ambion . cdna was synthesized from  <dig> μg of rna using the first strand cdna synthesis kit , according to the manufacturer's instructions. primers specific for cog transcripts, as well as for the positive control gapdh, were designed to avoid amplification of contaminating genomic dna, either because they span an intron or the forward primer anneals with an exon/exon boundary . pcr amplifications were performed using the qiagen multiplex pcr kit  at 1× qiagen multiplex pcr master mix with  <dig>  μl of cdna in a  <dig>  μl final reaction volume. final primer concentration in the reaction was  <dig>  μm. thermocycling conditions used included pre-incubation for  <dig> min at 95°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at 94°c,  <dig> s at 58°c, and  <dig> s at 72°c, with a final incubation for  <dig> min at 72°c. amplification products ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and were separated by horizontal electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining. rt-pcr products from one sample were confirmed by direct sequencing.

RESULTS
evolutionary analyses
as a first measure of the rate of cog proteins evolution, we calculated the pairwise protein distance for human proteins and each of the  <dig> orthologs. these values were plotted against the corresponding divergence times for the compared species, and the linear regression trend line was estimated from each group, as shown in figure  <dig>  from the slope of the lines and the r <dig> values we are able to compare the rate of proteins evolution and its constancy over time, respectively. the results presented in figure  <dig> show that cog <dig> is the subunit with the fastest rate of evolution; cog <dig>  cog <dig>  cog <dig> and cog <dig> have the lowest rates; while the remaining proteins  have intermediate rates. although being the most divergent protein, cog <dig>  is the one in which the rate of evolution has remained most constant .

in addition, we used a classical measure of protein evolution based on the nonsynonymous  to synonymous  substitutions rate ratio .

a ω value higher than  <dig> can suggest that genes undergo positive selection, while less than  <dig> is indicative of purifying selection  <cit> . following this approach, we tested whether ω ratios for each cog gene are different among lineages, based on the maximum likelihood phylogeny previously inferred . therefore, a likelihood ratio test  comparing the one-ratio model, that assumes the same ω for all lineages, and the free-ratio model, which assumes independent ω ratios for every branch, was applied. the log likelihoods obtained under each model are presented in table  <dig> and indicate significant variation in ω values among lineages in all cog genes except for cog <dig>  suggesting relaxation of the strong selective constraints in some lineages, yet with low ω. the ω values for branches in the phylogeny for each gene are available at additional file  <dig>  it is interesting to note that the length of the branch that leads to modern rodents  obtained for cog <dig> and cog <dig> is very long, revealing the accumulation of many substitutions . notwithstanding, the corresponding ω values are low, even when compared with shorter branches represented by non-rodent species. this suggests that rodent lineage has accumulated mainly synonymous rather than nonsynonymous substitutions, thus preserving the amino acid composition of the encoded protein. in fact, when the same cog <dig> and cog <dig> trees were drawn with branches lengths proportional to the expected nonsynonymous substitutions rate , the rodent's branch length is more similar to all the other branches .

although the ω ratio obtained under the one-ratio model does not fit every branch in the phylogeny, it represents an average over all sites and lineages  <cit>  and therefore can be used to compare the strength of constraints imposed to different cog genes. as presented in table  <dig>  all ω values are very low, indicating that cog genes are evolving under strong purifying selection. the highest ratio is observed for cog <dig>  while the lowest refers to cog <dig> and cog <dig> 

expression analyses in human and mouse
although several studies have been accumulating in the last years about cog complex, particularly in what concerns to the interaction between subunits, thus far the expression profile of different cog genes remains uncharacterized. therefore, as a preliminary approach to study the expression of cog genes, tissue dependent expression patterns have been inferred from est profiles accessible in unigene database  <cit> . for comparative purposes, the analysis was performed in homologous tissues in human and mouse for which expression information was available for both organisms.

it is important to recognize, however, that from est data and rt-pcr analysis we are not able to infer the precise pattern of expression of cog genes, revealing the need for more reliable quantitative data.

discussion
cog complex is essential to establish and maintain the structure and function of the golgi apparatus, which has itself a key role in many cellular processes, such as protein sorting and glycosylation.

in the present study, in order to better understand the evolution of cog subunits in vertebrates, we have applied distinct comparative strategies, including evolutionary and expression analyses.

we demonstrate that all cog proteins are evolving under strong evolutionary constraints, as revealed by the low dn/ds values. this pattern of purifying selection must reflect the critical role of cog complex for golgi function. this is well illustrated by mutations in cog-specific subunits, which give rise to different human diseases belonging to the congenital disorders of glycosylation . cdgs are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a deficient glycosylation of glycoconjugates, such as proteins and lipids. since  <dig>  defects in cog <dig>  <cit> , cog <dig>  <cit> , cog <dig>  <cit> , cog <dig>  <cit>  and cog <dig>  <cit>  have been reported. recently, a novel mutation in cog <dig> gene was detected in two patients with a cerebrocostomandibular-like syndrome  <cit> , showing that the impact of cog dysfunction is far from being completely known.

being part of a multi-subunit assembly and having such an important functional role in cells must impose strong constraints on the evolution of cog proteins. on one hand, they must be constrained to maintain the structural integrity of the complex, presumably through the conservation of the residues that are involved in the interaction between subunits. this is expected to be true if we assume that cog structure is maintained by the same type of protein-protein interactions in different species. on the other hand, additional interactions with other functional partners  also need to be preserved. the study of the crystallographic structure of the c-terminal region of human cog <dig> protein, for instance, showed that distinct domains are responsible for the integration of the protein within the complex and for its function  <cit> . this suggests that a large proportion of the protein sequence of each member of cog complex must be constrained to be evolutionarily conserved.

in fact, the low rate of evolution of cog proteins is consistent with results from more comprehensive studies showing that evolutionary conservation increases from monomeric proteins to members of transient interactions and finally to components of stable complexes   <cit> . wong and collaborators  <cit>  also demonstrated that as the number of unique proteins in a complex increases, the mean dn/ds ratio of the associated genes tends to decrease.

to evaluate the impact of different selective forces on cog proteins, it would be interesting to compare the rates of substitution for interacting and non-interacting residues, and also structural and functional domains. unfortunately, the structure of fragments of only two cog subunits have been reported  <cit> , hampering us to analyze with more detail the evolution of distinct regions of each protein.

despite all cog proteins are evolving under strong selective constraints, cog <dig> seems to be the one with the highest rate of evolution. this subunit, together with cog <dig>  is the bridging subunits of the mammalian cog complex, bringing together cog2- <dig> and cog5- <dig> subcomplexes  <cit> . interestingly, a quite similar interaction map has been reported in the yeast complex, although in this case only cog <dig> is required for the association of the two subcomplexes  <cit> . cog <dig> from humans and cog1p from yeast share no detectable sequence homology, as happens with cog <dig> and cog <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, our results revealed that cog <dig> and cog <dig> are also the less conserved subunits in vertebrates, suggesting that they are evolving under more relaxed selective constraints. the biological implication of the higher divergence of these proteins is difficult to infer, although we can speculate that it might be related with distinct requirements of cog's function in different species, or with the interactions established by these proteins. the remaining cog proteins , in contrast, have related homologs in human and yeast  <cit> .

in this study we have also demonstrated that the expression of cog genes exhibit a ubiquitous nature. these results can be taken as a starting point for more detailed quantitative expression studies that can bring additional insights into cog subunits interaction and function and, eventually, to the understanding of the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with different cog defects.

CONCLUSIONS
in the past years several studies have been focused on the evolution of protein complexes in terms of type of interactions, revealing that proteins in stable complexes are more conserved than those in transient interactions and those with no apparent interacting partners  <cit> .

in this study, in turn, we have investigated the evolution of different subunits belonging to the same protein complex in vertebrates. our results showed that the eight cog subunits seem to be conserved and evolving under strong purifying selection, in order to maintain the integrity and function of the complex. finally, we confirm the ubiquitous tissue expression of the eight cog transcripts in  <dig> human tissues.
