BACKGROUND
the presence of several catalytic domains embedded in the same polypeptide chain is an unusual molecular feature, whose evolutionary or functional advantages are still unclear  <cit> . however, recent works have provided evidence that a number of proteins from different organisms exhibit these complex architectures. among these multidomain enzymes there are luciferases, xylanases, chitinases, endoglucanases, kinases, and diverse hydrolases including proteases  <cit> . the occurrence of human proteases with different catalytic domains in the same translation product was first reported for two metalloproteinases: angiotensin-converting enzyme  and carboxypeptidase d  <cit> . ace is a type-i membrane-bound metalloproteinase with two enzymatically active domains which shows specific catalytic constants and interact differently with several competitive inhibitors  <cit> . carboxypeptidase d is also a type-i membrane metalloproteinase that contains three catalytic domains, two of them being catalytically active and showing optimal activities at different phs  <cit> . more recently, and as part of our studies on mammalian degradomes – the entire protease complement of these organisms  <cit>  –, we have identified and characterized a cdna encoding an unusual mosaic protease called polyserase- <dig>  <cit>  . this protein shows a complex domain organization including a type-ii transmembrane motif, a low-density lipoprotein receptor a module, and three tandem serine protease domains. interestingly, analysis of post-translational processing mechanisms of polyserase- <dig> revealed that it is synthesized as a membrane-bound protein which undergoes a series of proteolytic processing events to generate three independent serine protease domains  <cit> . further studies of the human degradome have revealed the occurrence of another gene coding for a protein with three tandem serine protease domains in a single polypeptide chain  <cit> . this protein – called polyserase- <dig> – is an extracellular glycosylated enzyme, whose three serine protease domains are not proteolytically cleaved and remain as an integral part of the same polypeptide chain. enzymatic analysis of polyserase- <dig> has demonstrated that only its first protease domain is catalytically active, whereas the second and third domains are inactive due to the lack of critical residues present in the catalytic triad of serine proteases  <cit> .

the finding of two polyserine proteases in the human genome, together with the presence of similar mosaic structures in serine proteases from other organisms such as xenopus laevis, bufo japonicus, drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , prompted us to explore the possibility that additional yet uncharacterized polyserases could be produced by human tissues. in this work, we report the finding of a novel human protein, tentatively called polyserase- <dig>  which contains two serine protease domains in its amino acid sequence. we describe the molecular cloning of a full-length cdna for this protein, and perform a structural and enzymatic analysis of this new protease. we also examine the expression pattern of polyserase- <dig> in human tissues and tumor cell lines, and perform a comparative analysis between this enzyme and the previously described polyserases- <dig> and - <dig> in terms of structural design, phylogenetic relationships, cellular location and post-translational maturation mechanisms. on the basis of the obtained results, we conclude that polyserase- <dig> is more closely related to polyserase- <dig> than to polyserase- <dig>  but also exhibits a series of characteristic features unique for this novel polyprotein among all other polyserine proteases described to date.

RESULTS
identification and molecular cloning of a new human polyserine protease
we used the polyserase- <dig> cdna as a query and the blast algorithm to search regions in the human genome that could encode new proteases with several serine protease domains within the same polypeptide chain. this search allowed us to identify a region in chromosome 16p <dig>  containing two serine protease domains closely linked. conceptual translation of these domains showed that they were different to the serine protease domains of polyserase- <dig> and prostasin, which are serine protease genes located at the same chromosomal region  <cit> . then, a pcr-based approach was designed to clone the cdnas for these two uncharacterized serine protease domains. to this end, we used rna from human liver and once the cloning process was completed, we confirmed that both domains were encoded by a single gene. computer analysis of the obtained sequence revealed that this cdna encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda . following the nomenclature system proposed for these enzymes  <cit> , we have tentatively called this new polyserine protease polyserase- <dig> 

a detailed analysis of polyserase- <dig> sequence showed that it contains the structural hallmarks characteristic of serine proteases , with some relevant particularities. thus, the sequence contains a signal peptide , which predicts that this protein is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum to direct its secretion outside of the cell. following this region, the first serine protease domain  can be recognized  although this domain does not show the arg-↓-ile-val-gly-gly consensus activation motif present in most of these enzymes. the sequence present instead at this region is pro-lys-pro-gln-glu. the catalytic triad of spd <dig> comprises the residues his <dig>  asp <dig>  and ser <dig>  following a short spacer region , the second serine protease domain  can be clearly identified . this domain also lacks a consensus activation motif and its catalytic triad comprises the residues his <dig>  asp <dig>  and ser <dig>  this last ser residue is located within the sequence gly-leu-ser-gly-ala , which does not exactly match the consensus motif gly-asp-ser-gly-gly found in this class of enzymes. there are also a number of cysteine residues in both protease domains of polyserase- <dig> which are conserved in serine proteases, including those located at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in spd <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> in spd <dig>  these residues could form two disulfide bonds which would determine that both protease domains remain linked to the polypeptide chain if a cleavage would take place at the activation site . all these structural features can also be found in the amino acid sequence of putative orthologs of polyserase- <dig> predicted from the genome analysis of pan troglodytes , bos taurus , canis familiaris , mus musculus , and rattus norvegicus  .

comparative analysis of polyserase- <dig> with other serine proteases
the predicted amino acid sequence corresponding to the catalytic region of each polyserase- <dig> protease domain revealed a high degree of identity with other serine proteases . comparative analysis of the first serine protease domain sequence indicated that the highest degree of identity was found with the first serine protease domain of polyserase- <dig> . significant percentage of identities were also found with pancreasin , the second serine protease domain of polyserase- <dig> , matriptase- <dig> , prostasin , and the third serine protease domain of polyserase- <dig> . the second domain of polyserase- <dig> was also found to be closely related to the first protease domain of polyserase- <dig>  as well as to other serine proteases such as γ-tryptase , the second serine protease domain of polyserase- <dig> , prostasin , matriptase- <dig> , and the first serine protease domain of polyserase- <dig> . all these enzymes, with the exception of polyserase- <dig>  belong to the transmembrane type  or to the tryptase/pancreasin families of serine proteases  <cit> . sequence alignments of these proteins with each protease domain of polyserase- <dig>  confirmed the extensive degree of conservation around the residues that form the catalytic triad of all these proteases. we also performed an analysis in the polyserase- <dig> sequence of molecular markers of serine protease evolution described by krem and di cera  <cit> . this analysis revealed that polyserase- <dig> as well as polyserases-  <dig> and - <dig> use exclusively tcn codons for their active site serine residues . we also found that the ser residues of all polyserases, which are equivalent to the ser- <dig> residue of chymotrypsinogen, are always encoded by agc codons. finally, analysis of the third molecular marker associated with catalytic function in serine proteases  revealed the presence of a pro residue in both domains of polyserase- <dig>  likewise, pro residues are present at the equivalent positions in the three serine protease domains of polyserase- <dig> as well as in the catalytically active domain of polyserase- <dig>  taken together, these results reinforce the classification of these polyproteases in the clan sa of serine proteases and extend the proposal of a close evolutionary relationship between them.

the phylogenetic tree for these proteins  also showed the close relationship of each polyserase- <dig> serine protease domain with the equivalent regions of polyserase- <dig>  together, the five protease domains of these two polyserases form a phylogenetic branch distantly related to the ttsp and tryptase/pancreasin families of serine proteases. furthermore, the exon-intron organization of the catalytic region of the first domain of polyserase- <dig> is similar to that of ttsp and tryptase/pancreasin serine protease genes. in fact, the length of the intron that separates the exons containing the his and asp residues of the catalytic triad of the first protease domain of polyserase- <dig>  is similar to that found in the equivalent region of matriptase- <dig>  <cit> . however, the length of the remaining introns is similar to that found in the equivalent regions of the α/β-tryptases . we have previously described that the polyserase- <dig> gene also shows a pattern of exon-intron organization that shares similarities with both groups of serine proteases  <cit> . likewise, the polyserase- <dig> gene also contains three coding exons in the genomic region that comprises the signal sequence and the putative activation site. by contrast, only two coding exons are found in the equivalent region of α/β-tryptase genes  <cit> .

molecular modeling of polyserase- <dig> serine protease domains
the amino acid sequence similarity between each serine protease domain of polyserase- <dig> and serine proteases whose three-dimensional structures are available, opened the possibility of performing their structural modeling . this analysis revealed a significant degree of similarity between both domains of polyserase- <dig> and some members of the tryptase family, such as human β-tryptase ii  <cit> . thus, in the predicted structure there is a loop that surrounds a calcium ion in most serine proteases   <cit> , although in the case of spd <dig> and β-ii tryptase is shorter, and it does not exist in spd <dig>  suggesting that polyserase- <dig> does not requires calcium for its activity. apart from the disulfide bonds deduced from the alignment of polyserase- <dig> sequence with other serine proteases, the structural model of polyserase- <dig> predicts the existence of seven additional disulfide bonds. four of these bonds are predicted to occur within spd <dig>  and the eight cysteine residues involved would be cys62-cys <dig>  cys158-cys <dig>  cys187-cys <dig>  and cys220-cys <dig>  equivalent disulfide bonds are predicted in the structure of the human β-tryptase ii . the three remaining bonds would occur within spd <dig>  and the involved residues would be cys326-cys <dig>  cys444-cys <dig>  and cys474-cys <dig> .

polyserase- <dig> is a secreted and non-glycosylated protein
the pcep-pol <dig> vector was used to transfect 293-ebna cells. immuno-localization experiments using an anti-flag antibody showed a strong eccentric perinuclear signal . moreover, and consistent with the absence of a membrane localization motif in the polyserase- <dig> sequence, we did not find any evidence of immunostaining at the cell surface. similar results were obtained using hela cells transfected with the pcep-pol <dig> vector . likewise, the positive signal was only detected if cells were previously permeabilized using triton x- <dig>  this situation resembles that observed for polyserase- <dig>  <cit>  and differs from that of polyserase- <dig>  which is a membrane-bound polyprotease  <cit> . all these findings strongly suggest that polyserase- <dig> is a secreted polyserine protease. this possibility was further confirmed by western blot analysis of the conditioned medium prepared from pcep-pol <dig> transfected cells . in fact, the anti-flag antibody detected one immunoreactive band of about  <dig> kda, which fits with the expected size for unprocessed polyserase- <dig>  on the other hand, a doublet of similar size, which likely represents the protein with or without signal peptide, was detected in cell fractions, but none of them were present in cells transfected with the empty vector. to evaluate the possibility that the flag epitope could hamper the proper processing of the two serine protease domains of polyserase- <dig>  we generated a construct lacking this epitope but keeping a histag tail at the c-terminus. western blot analysis using an anti-histag antibody showed the same result as above , thereby confirming that both protease domains of polyserase- <dig> remain as integral parts of the same polypeptide chain. additionally, and contrary to polyserase- <dig>  the mobility of the band detected with this anti-histag antibody was not altered in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of n-glycosylation, suggesting that polyserase- <dig> is a non-glycosylated protein. consistent with this, analysis of the polyserase- <dig> sequence using the netnglyc  <dig>  server  <cit>  predicted that the only putative n-glycosylation site present in this protein , would not be effectively glycosylated.

production, purification and enzymatic assays of full-length polyserase- <dig> and its serine-protease domains
to produce the recombinant proteins, we first transformed e. coli strain bl <dig> plyse with plasmids pgex-pol3spd <dig>  pgex-pol3spd <dig>  and pgex-pol <dig>  moreover, we used adam <dig> disintegrin domain fused to gst to verify the purification processes as well as a negative control in the enzymatic assays  <cit> . after iptg induction of bacterial cells transformed with these plasmids, fusion proteins of the expected size  were detected by sds-page . once the purification process was carried out as indicated above, the fusion proteins were visualized by sds-page , and their identities confirmed by western blotting using an anti-gst antibody . we next incubated the recombinant protein with a variety of different endogenous proteins including type i collagen, type i laminin, gelatin, pro-upa and fibrinogen were treated with the recombinant proteases. among all these potential extracellular substrates, fibrinogen and pro-upa were clearly degraded by the entire polyserase- <dig>  but not by its serine protease domains produced as independent proteins . this activity was abolished by preincubating the enzyme with aebsf, a serine protease inhibitor, but not when the enzyme was treated with inhibitors of other classes of proteases . these data provide additional support to the proposal of this enzyme as a catalytically active serine protease. moreover, sds-page analysis of the recombinant polyserase- <dig> incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c also indicates that the enzyme is released from the gst-moiety , which could be due to an autoactivation process of polyserase- <dig>  similarly to fusion proteins containing the catalytic domain of matriptase- <dig>  <cit>  or matriptase- <dig>  <cit> .

polyserase- <dig> may form active dimers
some tryptases, which share several features with polyserase- <dig>  can form active tetramers. moreover, other members of this group of serine proteases, such as mouse mast cell tryptase  <cit> , are able to degrade the α-chain of fibrinogen when forming tetramers in a similar manner to that shown herein for polyserase- <dig>  on this basis, we hypothesized that two polyserase- <dig> molecules could associate to produce a protein structurally equivalent to the tetramers formed by this type of tryptases. to evaluate this question, we produced a recombinant protein containing a 6xhistag tail at the n-terminus. this new recombinant polyserase- <dig>  purified as described in experimental procedures, was incubated in the presence or absence of a reducing agent  and detected by western blot using an anti-histag antibody . the presence of two immunoreactive bands in native conditions and one band of the expected size in the sample containing the denaturing reagent suggested that polyserase- <dig> forms dimers which seems to be stabilized by disulfide bridges, as reported for the dog mast cell protease- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, this recombinant 6xhis tagged polyserase- <dig> degrades fibrinogen similarly to the gst-polyserase- <dig> protein , suggesting that fibrinogen degradation by the fusion protein, could occur once polyserase- <dig> is released from the gst.

analysis of polyserase- <dig> expression in human tissues
a cdna probe specific for human polyserase- <dig> was used to hybridize northern blots containing poly+ rnas from a variety of human fetal and adult tissues, and tumor cell lines . this analysis showed a band of about  <dig>  kb in different adult tissues including liver, heart, testis, ovary, intestine, colon and leukocytes. a band of the same size was observed in all analyzed fetal tissues such as kidney, liver, lung and brain. this transcript was also detected in human cancer cell lines, including hela , molt- <dig> , and sw <dig> . bioinformatic analysis using different programs available at the nix tool  <cit> , predicts a transcript of around  <dig> kb for this gene, suggesting that the higher band observed in fig.  <dig>  likely corresponds to a full-length polyserase- <dig> transcript. however, other transcripts of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb were observed at placenta, testis, hela and molt- <dig> cells. the presence of these transcripts of smaller size suggests that the polyserase- <dig> gene could also be regulated through alternative splicing events which may produce a protein without one of its serine protease domains. this mrna processing of a multidomain protease has also been described for polyserases - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
in this work, we have performed an exhaustive bioinformatic analysis of the human genome to try to identify new serine proteases that could contain different catalytic domains within the same polypeptide chain. these bioinformatic searches led us to find a region in chromosome 16p <dig>  putatively encoding a new polyprotease. after completing the cloning process using liver cdna as template, we confirmed that the identified sequence was a new polyserine proteinase that we called polyserase- <dig> to underline its structural relationship with the previously described polyserases- <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . however, the polyserase- <dig> architecture is less complex than the exhibited by the two other human polyproteases. thus, this new polyserase is composed of two serine protease domains preceded by a signal peptide, whereas both polyserase- <dig> and polyserase- <dig> contain three catalytic domains in a single polypeptide chain.

a comparative structural analysis also revealed that polyserase- <dig> is more closely related to polyserase- <dig> than to polyserase- <dig>  thus, and similar to polyserase- <dig>  polyserase- <dig> is a secreted soluble protein that lacks additional domains found in polyserase- <dig> such as a type ii transmembrane sequence and a low-density lipoprotein receptor motif. likewise, the serine protease domains of polyserase- <dig> and polyserase- <dig> remain as integral parts of the same molecule, whereas polyserase- <dig> undergoes a series of post-translational processing events that release the three protease domains from the initial translation product  <cit> . the structural basis for these differences may derive from the fact that both protease domains of polyserase- <dig>  as well as the second and third protease domains of polyserase- <dig>  are preceded by a region lacking the consensus activation motif arg-ile-val-gly-gly, characteristic of serine proteases. therefore, it is unlikely that these domains can be separated from the original polypeptide chain by a trypsin-like protease. nevertheless, the possibility that polyserase- <dig> can be activated under specific circumstances through alternative mechanisms such as those operating in α-tryptase  <cit> , can not be ruled out.

the phylogenetic analysis of human serine proteases whose sequence is available, also revealed the relationship between polyserases- <dig> and - <dig>  since the different serine protease domains of both polyproteases are grouped together and form a branch equally distant from members of the ttsp and the tryptase/prostasin families. interestingly, analysis of the gene structure and organization of polyserases- <dig> and - <dig> showed common features with these two groups of serine proteases. therefore, it is possible that ancestors of both ttsps and tryptase/prostasin contributed to the formation of these polyserases through recombination or exon swapping events. likewise, the gene encoding polyserase- <dig> maps very close to the polyserase- <dig> and prostasin genes at chromosome 16p <dig> , a region linked to genetic abnormalities whose loci remain unidentified. these pathologies include paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis  <cit>  and autosomal dominant myxomatous mitral valve prolapse  <cit> , opening the possibility that the identified human polyserases could be implicated in the development of these diseases. nevertheless, beyond all these similarities between human polyserases- <dig> and - <dig>  clear differences were also detected between them. thus, we have previously reported that polyserase- <dig> is a glycosylated protein that only shows catalytic activity in its first serine protease domain. by contrast, polyserase- <dig> is a secreted and non-glycosylated enzyme.

as an initial step towards the functional characterization of polyserase- <dig>  we analyzed its expression profile in different human tissues. these studies revealed additional differences between polyserase- <dig> and the previously described human polyserases in their patterns of expression in different tissues and cancer cell lines. thus, polyserase- <dig> is mainly expressed in adult heart, liver, intestine, ovary and testis, as well as in all analyzed fetal tissues including kidney, brain, liver and lung. by contrast, polyserase- <dig> is predominantly detected in adult skeletal muscle, liver, placenta, prostate and heart, as well as in fetal kidney but not in fetal lung, liver or brain. it is also noteworthy that several human tumor cell lines also express this new polyprotease, a feature shared with the previously described human polyserases, opening the possibility that these complex serine proteases could mediate proteolytic processes associated with tumor development or progression  <cit> .

to evaluate the possibility that polyserase- <dig> is an active enzyme with ability to perform these proteolytic events, we undertook the production of the entire protein as well as its two serine protease domains as independent proteins. the activity assays showed that the complete polyserase- <dig> is able to degrade some substrates present in the extracellular matrix such as fibrinogen and pro-upa. these results suggest that this enzyme could contribute to tumor progression either through the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins or the activation of other components including different tumor-associated proteases  <cit> . contrary to the situation with the entire protein, the two serine protease domains produced as independent proteins did not show any apparent proteolytic activity against the substrates indicated above. interestingly, members of the tryptase family – that show significant degree of structural similarity with both protease domains of polyserase-3- are secreted as monomers and must form tetramers to carry out the catalysis  <cit> . these facts prompted us to evaluate whether this enzyme could dimerize to generate a protein with four potential active sites, and whose quaternary structure could be similar to that formed by the tryptases. to analyze this possibility, we compared the electrophoretic mobility of the recombinant protein under non-reducing and reducing conditions. this assay would indicate that approximately half of the purified polyserase- <dig> may form active dimers which are likely stabilized through the formation of disulfide bonds. the information derived from the three-dimensional models generated for spd <dig> and spd <dig> was also consistent with this possibility. thus, these models, together with predictions based on amino acid sequence alignments, suggest that polyserase- <dig> possesses a total of nine intrachain disulfide bonds. however, there are three free cysteines  that could be involved in the stabilization of the polyserase- <dig> dimer through the formation of disulfide bonds. the stability of the dimer would be further maintained by a series of conserved tryptophan residues  that have been reported to be necessary for mouse mast cell tryptase dimerization and activity  <cit> . interestingly, this protease can also cleave the α-chain of fibrinogen as demonstrated herein for polyserase- <dig>  due to the homology of polyserase- <dig> and β-ii tryptase, we cannot rule out the existence of further interactions involving hydrogen bonds and salt bridges and participating in the dimer formation through the six loops  previously described for β-ii tryptase  <cit> . regarding the fact that fibrinogen cannot be cleaved by spd <dig> or spd <dig> produced as independent proteins, we can speculate that the presence of three aspartic acid residues  in a loop of spd <dig> could form a negatively charged anchoring site that would compete with the substrate binding pocket when the protein is in a monomer state. stabilization of this loop in the dimer state, probably by spd <dig>  would grant access for the substrate to the active site. these acidic residues seem also to be important for β-ii tryptase, whose enzymatic activity is totally abolished in the monomer state  <cit> . nevertheless, further functional studies will be necessary to verify these predictions in the case of polyserase- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of the third human polyserase allows establishing the polyserases as a group of enzymes containing different tandem serine protease domains. these findings raise new questions about the functions of these intriguing polyenzymes and their possible involvement in human diseases. in particular, the search for the in vivo substrates of polyserase- <dig> and the generation of mice deficient in this gene would contribute to ascertain the relevance of this enzyme in both normal and pathological conditions. finally, the resolution of the three- dimensional structure of polyserase- <dig> and that of the remaining human polyserases, could help to understand the functional relevance of the presence of several catalytic domains within the same polypeptide chain.
