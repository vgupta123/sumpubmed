BACKGROUND
in recent years illumina sequencing has emerged as a mainstay for numerous biological applications. due to the immense number of sequences that can be obtained, it is often useful to sequence dna from multiple samples in a single run. this multiplexing process relies upon unique “index” sequences, termed i <dig> and i <dig>  that are added to both sides of the dna being sequenced. with only a few unique i <dig> and i <dig> sequences, hundreds of different i <dig> and i <dig> combinations can be created, enabling many samples to be simultaneously sequenced. de-multiplexing the samples after sequencing only requires finding the sequencing reads associated with each index pair that was added to the sequencing run.

as with other sequencing approaches, the illumina method has been characterized for the frequency and type of errors that are generated  <cit> . substitutions, where one base is misread as another, are the most frequent error class and occur more often toward the end of the sequence  <cit> . insertions, deletions and motif-specific errors occur less frequently, but they can still cause problems for certain applications  <cit> .

another type of error involves cross-talk among multiplexed samples and has received far less attention despite recent reports that error rates can be significant . such errors are particularly insidious in applications that require the detection of variants that are rare in one sample but abundant in others, which includes biosphere surveys, investigations of ancient dna, and the identification of cancerous cells  <cit> . cross-talk errors can also be problematic if a large number of samples are multiplexed, such that each sample is a small fraction of the total number of reads. since cross-talk can come from multiple sources, it has sometimes been attributed to experimental mistakes, cross-contamination during primer synthesis, multiple misread bases within index sequences, or sample carryover from previous sequencing runs on the same machine  <cit> .

in view of the increasing importance of multiplexing on the illumina platform, we systematically investigated cross-talk errors in order to rule out certain causes and determine whether there are any satisfactory solutions to the problem. to this end, we constructed  <dig> unique combinations of i <dig> indices, i <dig> indices, and read sequences  while carefully controlling for potential sources of cross-contamination such as primer synthesis. the sequences of all reads were well-separated in sequence space to minimize cross-talk due to misread bases. surprisingly, we observed that cross-talk was due to three different types of misassignments  that occurred at similar rates. furthermore, we found that quality filtering of the index pairs was sufficient to all but eliminate misassignments between samples without sacrificing a substantial fraction of reads.fig.  <dig> rates of different misassignment errors on the illumina platform. a unique index and read sequences that were well separated in sequence space  were used to form  <dig> distinct samples and multiplexed in the same illumina sequencing run. misread bases  make up the most common error type, but are still attributable to their correct triplet. b misassigned reads appear as unexpected triplets, and can be categorized as either index misassignments  or sequence misassignments 




RESULTS
using standard de-multiplexing protocols, we observed a  <dig>  % rate of sequence misassignments, which have the correct i <dig> and i <dig> index pair but incorrect sequence, and a  <dig>  % rate of index misassignments, which have a correct sequence read but a single incorrect i <dig> or i <dig> index. these rates are consistent with prior studies that found misassignment rates between  <dig>  and  <dig>  %  <cit> . furthermore, the rate of sequence misassignment was similar to that of i <dig> or i <dig> index misassignment , indicating that the sequence is being misassigned rather than both index sequences being independently misassigned. both sequence and index misassignments will contribute to cross-talk between samples when each sample is separated from other samples by a single index, whereas only sequence misassignments are relevant when unique dual-indexing is used. nevertheless, the existence of sequence misassignments indicates that even the use of two unique index sequences is insufficient to eliminate cross-talk.

misassignments can in principle result from multiple misread bases within an index sequence. however, even at a high average error rate of 1 % , the chance of at least three positions being misread is 10− <dig> assuming that errors are independent. the observed rate of index misassignment was far greater than expected, regardless of the number of differences between index sequences . if two unique index sequences are used, the probability of both the i <dig> and i <dig> being misread as another index pair is expected to be around 10− <dig>  therefore, since we obtained approximately  <dig> million reads per sample, we would expect zero sequence misassignment due to misread bases. to further verify these assumptions, we de-multiplexed another index pair where neither the i <dig> or i <dig> index was included in the experiment. there were no reads attributed to this index pair, confirming that the per-base error rate of illumina sequencing does not explain the observed rate of cross-talk.fig.  <dig> misassignment rates were weakly correlated with the hamming distance between index sequences. a matrices showing the hamming distance between i <dig> and i <dig> index sequences used in this study. b the rate of triplets with an incorrect i <dig>  index as a function of the hamming distance to the correct i <dig>  index. horizontal lines indicate the mean misassignment rate at each hamming distance. note the log-scale y-axis. the theoretical misassignment rates based on independent substitutions are shown in gray for an exaggerated 10 % substitution rate ; lower substitution rates would simply shift the dashed-line to the left. the observed misassignment rate does not decrease exponentially as would be expected if misread errors are independent, indicating that misread bases are not the cause of misassignment errors




having ruled out misread bases as the cause of most misassignments, we next investigated whether incorrect reads were associated with low quality scores. figure  <dig> shows that correct triplets  tended to have high quality in both index read steps, whereas index misassignments tended to be low quality in the step for which they were misassigned. the average quality scores of i <dig> and i <dig> index reads appear to be largely independent, i.e. low quality in one does not imply low quality in the other. this may be due to the fact that the two index sequences are read separately after the cluster is inverted on the flow cell. in contrast, sequence misassignments tended to have poor quality i <dig> and i <dig> index reads in addition to a low quality sequence read . moreover, quality scores were generally lower across the entire length of misassigned reads, rather than only being low quality in a specific region .fig.  <dig> breakdown of average quality scores by error type. each point represents the reads obtain for one triplet , and is scaled to the log of the read count. correct triplets  have high quality across all read steps, whereas sequence misassignments have low quality in all three read steps. in contrast, index misassignments tend to have low quality in the step for which they are misassigned




the observed quality score pattern has several implications for filtering incorrect reads. first, filtering low quality sequence reads is expected to be insufficient to eliminate anything other than sequence misassignments. this implies that the i <dig> and i <dig> must be quality filtered to eliminate index misassignments. second, filtering low quality i <dig> and i <dig> index reads may be sufficient to eliminate both sequence misassignments and index misassignments without needing to quality filter the sequence read. we tested these hypotheses by applying increasing stringencies of quality score filtering and observing the remaining cross-talk. here we distinguished between three strategies: quality filtering only the sequences, only the index pairs, and filtering all read steps. as expected, keeping only high quality sequence reads nearly eliminated sequence misassignments but not index misassignments , whereas filtering the index sequences largely prevented all types of misassignment. by filtering the index reads to an average quality score of ≥  <dig>  it was possible to reduce the overall rate of incorrect triplets from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % while maintaining 88 % of total reads. a combined strategy was only slightly more effective at eliminating both types of misassignment. thus, quality filtering of index reads provides a simple way to minimize cross-talk while preserving the vast majority of reads.fig.  <dig> trade-off between removing misassigned and preserving correct reads during quality filtering.  misassignments were not efficiently removed by quality filtering the sequence reads , whereas quality filtering the i <dig> and i <dig> index sequences was highly effective . quality filtering sequence reads in addition to index reads  did not remove substantially more cross-talk.  quality filtering either sequence reads or index reads was effective at removing sequence misassignments




discussion
misassignment errors could result from distinct cluster originators forming at an overlapping spot on the flow cell  <cit> . if this were the case, we might expect the quality score profiles of incorrect reads to oscillate between low quality in positions where the two sequence clusters differ  and high quality where they are identical . however, we did not observe any such pattern in the quality score signals of incorrect triplets, perhaps because there is a poor correlation between the quality score and the actual probability of error  <cit>  or because neighboring positions are taken into account when assigning quality scores. nevertheless, we would expect overlapping clusters to lower the quality of all read steps due to competing signals, yet this was also not observed. instead it appears that one cluster tends to overpower the other during each read step , and the overpowering cluster in the pair can switch between read steps.

while a quality score threshold of  <dig> was sufficient to eliminate most misassignments in this study, this threshold may vary from run-to-run depending on the run’s overall quality and other factors. for this reason, it may be useful to detect misassignments and then vary the quality score threshold to observe its effect on their removal . misassignments can be detected by de-multiplexing index combinations that should not be present in the sequencing run but for which the i <dig> and i <dig> index sequences exist separately in other samples. in the absence of misassignments the number of sequences attributable to missing index pairs should be zero. this provides a straightforward method for both verifying misassignments and confirming their removal. also, this method does not depend upon knowing the sequence variants that belong to each sample.fig.  <dig> recommended procedure for removing background reads. a when using unique dual index sequences for every sample , each missing index pair offers a negative control that provides an estimate of the number of misassigned reads . b when almost all index combinations are being used, controls can be added by purposefully omitting samples for some combinations of index sequences. c the quality score threshold  can then be optimized by plotting the sum of misassignments versus the number of reads remaining. d a value of qthresh can be selected that minimizes misassignments while maximizing the number of reads that remain




CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of cross-talk on the illumina platform that uses standard dual indexing as opposed to custom or single indexing schemes. previous studies of cross-talk identified the advantages of dual indexing over single indexing and of quality filtering index sequences  <cit> . here we extended these findings by showing that there are three independent modes of cross-talk: incorrect i <dig> index, i <dig> index, and sequence. the existence of sequence misassignments prevents dual indexing from completely eliminating cross-talk without quality filtering. it also means that if only a single  index is used, filtering on sequence quality in addition to index quality is the best strategy. in agreement with previous work  <cit> , we determined that no amount of quality filtering can completely eliminate cross-talk when samples are only separated by one of two index sequences. thus, unique dual indexing is required when identification of extremely rare variants is critical. we also proposed a simple method for both quantifying cross-talk and choosing run-specific or application-specific thresholds for mitigating it by counting reads assigned to unexpected index pairs during quality filtering .

cross-talk between samples effectively limits the number of index pair combinations that can be reliably used. as the fraction of clusters sharing an i <dig> or i <dig> increases, the number of misassigned reads will concomitantly increase. eventually, even at small rates of misassignment the incorrect reads would rise to an intolerable level if enough index combinations were used. this is supported by a previous study in which the rate of cross-talk was estimated to approach 1 % when  <dig> index pair combinations were used  <cit> . for this reason, we believe it is necessary to quality filter index reads in addition to the sequencing read when employing a multiplexing strategy. furthermore, to mitigate the issue of spurious results due to cross-talk in the literature, we recommend that repositories such as the sequence read archive   <cit>  enable and encourage the submission of quality scores for index sequences and unexpected  index pairs. this would allow retroactive filtering of published sequences, and would also provide a means for automatic accumulation of data on the magnitude of sample cross-talk as sequencing platforms evolve.
