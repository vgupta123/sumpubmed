BACKGROUND
colorectal cancer  is a leading cause of cancer mortality with more than  <dig>  deaths per year globally  <cit> . crc can be divided into two major subgroups: microsatellite stable  and microsatellite unstable cancers , the latter being characterized by a defective mismatch repair system, which leads to mutations in microsatellite repeat regions  <cit> . the two subgroups also show differences in transcriptional profiles and clinical disease course  <cit> . a key event in the transformation of colonic epithelial cells is the activation of the wnt-signaling pathway, which is observed in the vast majority of colorectal tumors  <cit> . following activation of the wnt pathway, β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus where it interacts with members of the tcf/lef transcription factors, such as tcf <dig>  and tcf <dig>  leading to expression of target genes including myc, sox <dig> and cyclin d <dig>  furthermore, it has previously been shown that wnt signaling also plays a regulatory role in alternative splicing  <cit> .

the generation of proteome diversity from a rather limited number of genes is primarily due to alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage, the latter leading to multiple transcripts from the same gene with different transcription start sites . it has been estimated that 30-50% of all human genes have multiple promoters  <cit> , and among the genes with experimentally well described alternative promoters are several cancer related genes such as myc  <cit> , tp <dig>  <cit>  and brca <dig>  <cit> . genome-wide predictive analysis has shown that alternative promoters are overrepresented in genes involved in development and transcriptional control, whereas genes with only a single promoter are more frequently involved in general cellular processes  <cit> . alternative tss can have crucial impact on both the transcriptional level and stability of the transcript as well as the function and cellular localization of the translated protein  <cit> . an example of a transcript with directly opposite effects is the transcription factor tcf <dig> where the use of alternative promoters results in the formation of two isoforms with different β-catenin binding capability. while the long isoform of tcf <dig> interacts with β-catenin and stimulates transcription of wnt-target genes, the short isoform, unable to bind β-catenin but with the dna binding domain intact, acts as a dominant negative regulator of β-catenin mediated wnt signaling  <cit> .

in the present study, a genome-wide search revealed nine genes with tumor-specific tss usage in neoplastic colorectal tissue samples. for some of the genes, the tumor-specific tss usage was not restricted to crc, but was observed in other cancer types as well. the use of alternative tsss in osbpl1a and trak <dig> was found to be regulated by the wnt pathway and also observed in gastric, prostate and brain tumors. protein levels of osbpl1a and tcf <dig> were found to be deregulated in colorectal tumors and the protein expression of tcf <dig> correlated with progression free survival of stage ii crc.

RESULTS
identification of differential transcription start site usage
to investigate whether the use of alternative tsss was associated with tumor development, normal colorectal mucosa , colorectal adenoma  and crc samples  were profiled using the affymetrix human exon  <dig>  st array. the refseq database  was queried for genes with two or more known transcripts with different tsss. in total,  <dig> protein-coding genes containing multiple tsss were identified and matched to exon array core transcript clusters by gene symbol of which  <dig> genes had available exon expression data. genes, containing exons potentially involved in tumor associated alternative tss usage or alternative splicing, were identified using a splicing anova approach. additional filtering criteria  were used to select  <dig> candidate genes for manual inspection in a genomic context. the manual curation indicated tumor associated alternative tss usage in nine  of the  <dig> genes. to confirm these findings, two independent crc sample sets  were investigated. all nine genes showed expression profiles consistent with tumor-specific alternative tss usage in at least one of the independent validation sets.

qrt-pcr validation of alternative tss candidates
three candidate genes  with different expression characteristics were chosen for technical validation with quantitative real-time reverse-transcription pcr  on a subset of the samples used for exon array analysis. transcription factor  <dig> , a member of the basic helix-loop-helix e-protein family with an e-box consensus binding site, exists as a long and a short variant. according to the exon array data, the long variant was expressed in both normal and tumor samples at roughly the same level, whereas the short isoform was expressed in the majority of the tumor samples, but not detected above background in the normal samples . this indicated that the short isoform of tcf <dig> was de novo synthesized in the majority of the tumor samples, especially in adenomas and mss carcinomas . exon array data from paired normal and adenoma samples were available for  <dig> patients, and for five of these patients exon array expression data were available for a matched carcinoma sample as well. increased expression of tcf <dig> exon 1b in tumor samples was seen in  <dig> of  <dig> sample pairs  . for qrt-pcr validation of the shift in tcf <dig> tss usage, six normal samples,  <dig> adenoma samples, divided in two groups based on expression of the short tcf <dig> isoform , and six mss cancer samples were selected. qrt-pcr confirmed de novo expression of the short tcf <dig> isoform  in many tumor samples  and showed strong correlation to the exon array data .

oxysterol-binding protein-related protein  <dig>  is an intracellular lipid receptor which is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein  family and exists as a long and a short transcript variant. the long variant was expressed at roughly the same level in normal and tumor samples, whereas the short variant was down-regulated in most tumor samples . the ratio between the long and short variant was shifted significantly towards the long variant in both adenoma and cancer samples . this shift was also highly significant  in the  <dig> paired normal and tumor samples, where a lower ratio was observed in all  <dig> tumor samples . this tumor-specific isoform shift was confirmed by qrt-pcr in  <dig> tissue samples  , which showed a robust correlation between exon array and qrt-pcr data .

finally, trafficking kinesin-binding protein  <dig> , a kinesin-binding protein associated with mitochondria, contains two alternative start exons  with differential expression in normal and tumor samples . the ratio was shifted towards exon 1b in both adenoma and cancer samples , including all  <dig> tumors with matched normal samples  . this trend was also confirmed by qrt-pcr in the same  <dig> tissue samples described above . again, a fine correlation between exon array and qrt-pcr data was observed . we speculated whether alternative splicing rather than alternative tss could explain the observed findings for trak <dig>  however, in both normal and tumor samples only one qrt-pcr product was observed for the primer set spanning the alternative trak <dig> exon 1b , with a length consistent with lack of exon 1b. this demonstrates that no transcript containing exons  <dig>  1b and  <dig> exists. by contrast pcr with primers in exon 1b and  <dig> produces a product. this indicates that the transcript template of the latter product starts with exon 1b, and, hence, that alternative tss rather than alternative splicing is the mechanism generating the transcript. in conclusion, qrt-pcr confirmed the tumor associated alternative tsss for all three candidates, demonstrating that exon array data reliably identify alternative tss usage.

qrt-pcr validation of alternative tss in laser capture microdissected samples
it is well known that tissue composition changes from normal mucosa to tumor biopsies, and, potentially, the observed changes in tss usage could reflect this rather than altered expression in the neoplastic cells. to address this question, we analyzed tcf <dig>  osbpl1a and trak <dig> isoform expression in laser capture microdissected  samples from six patients. from each patient, tumor and adjacent normal tissue biopsies were dissected to provide four samples per patient . the short tcf <dig> isoform was expressed in half of the patients, and solely in cancer cells or, interestingly, cancer derived stroma, thus, confirming the tumor-specificity we observed in non-lcm samples . for osbpl1a, a primer set measuring the long variant showed expression in half of the cancer and the cancer derived stroma samples, whereas the expression in the normal epithelium was low in all but one sample. a primer set measuring the expression of both isoforms showed low expression levels in both cancer epithelium and cancer derived stroma, whereas four of the six patients had a markedly higher expression in the normal epithelium and, for the same samples, a lower expression in the stroma from normal biopsies . trak <dig> exon 1a was found to be expressed in only two normal epithelial samples, whereas no expression of the tumor preferred exon 1b was observed in either fraction from the normal sample. exon 1b was expressed in half of the cancer epithelium samples of which two also had expression of exon 1a . in summary, the experiments confirmed that the tumor associated alternative tss usages observed for tcf <dig>  osbpl1a and trak <dig> were indeed due to altered expression in the carcinoma cells, and not a consequence of altered tissue composition.

alternative tss use in other cancer types
because many of the cancer associated expression changes identified to date generally play a role in cancers from different organs, we speculated whether the collection of tumor associated alternative tsss identified here in the context of crc could also have relevance to other cancers. to address this question, we acquired exon array expression data from gastric, liver, lung, bladder, brain and prostate normal and cancer samples. chek <dig> tumor associated alternative tsss usage, which yields transcripts differing only in their 5' untranslated region  , was most widely associated with cancer. in addition to crc, a significant change in tss usage was found in gastric, liver, lung and bladder cancer along with brain gliomas . significant expression changes of the osbpl1a isoforms were observed in gastric and prostate cancer and metastases from prostate cancer patients along with brain gliomas . for liver, lung and bladder cancer, the trend was the same although not significant . isoform expression changes were also found for tcf <dig> in brain gliomas . in summary, the analysis confirmed that some of the observed tumor associated tss usages were not restricted to crc.

transcription factor binding analysis
differences in preferred tss could be explained by differential expression of transcription factors  controlling the activation of promoters located near the tss of the nine selected genes. to identify tfs potentially responsible for the observed shifts in expressed isoforms, we performed tf binding site enrichment analysis in the toucan <dig> software  <cit> . we chose to look at the sequence  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream from the tss, which was defined as the start site of the matching refseq sequence. significantly overrepresented tf binding matrices were queried against the exon array expression data to identify deregulated tfs with enriched binding. five tfs were significantly downregulated in tumor samples  and had enriched binding motifs near the tss most commonly used in the normal mucosa samples , whereas only two tfs, tp <dig> and sox <dig>  were found to be significantly upregulated in tumor samples  along with having binding enrichment near the preferred tss of the carcinoma samples, and, interestingly, sox <dig> is known to be regulated by the wnt pathway  <cit> . in summary, tumor-specific tf deregulation may contribute to the observed change of tss usage.

the wnt pathway regulates the expression of osbpl1a isoforms
tcf <dig> is a key mediator of the wnt-signaling pathway which is mutationally activated in ~85% of crcs  <cit> . previously, in vivo tcf <dig> binding domains have been identified in the ls174t crc cell line using a chip-on-chip approach  <cit> . interestingly, this study indicated that tcf <dig> binds just upstream of the tss of the long osbpl1a variant as well as upstream of both trak <dig> tsss. this suggests that tcf <dig> is involved in regulating the tss usage of these genes. to determine the impact of altered wnt signaling  on the expression of osbpl1a and trak <dig> isoforms, overexpression of a dominant negative form of tcf <dig>  was used to interrupt the tcf <dig> mediated part of the wnt-pathway in the two crc cell lines, dld <dig> and ls174t  <cit> . the ratio between the long and the short isoform of osbpl1a was significantly changed in both the dld <dig>  and the ls174t  cell lines when dntcf <dig> was overexpressed , mainly due to downregulation of the long variant. interestingly, overexpression of a dominant negative form of tcf <dig>  another transcription factor involved in mediating wnt signaling, did not alter the ratio between the two osbpl1a isoforms . although dntcf <dig> targets the same sequence elements as tcf <dig>  it cannot be ruled out that the observed expression changes could be unexpected artifacts of the dntcf <dig> overexpression rather than disrupted wnt-signaling. to address this caveat, we antagonized the signaling cascade upstream of tcf <dig>  by sirna mediated knock down of β-catenin, the key regulator of wnt signaling. as for the dntcf <dig> overexpression experiment, this led to a significant change  in the ratio between the two osbpl1a isoforms . this indicated that the wnt pathway is truly involved in regulating the tss usage of osbpl1a.

for trak <dig>  the ratio between the two isoforms shifted significantly, either when dntcf <dig> or dntcf <dig> was overexpressed . surprisingly, the most frequently found isoform in normal mucosa samples was the most infrequent when the wnt-pathway was disrupted by the overexpression of dntcf <dig> or dntcf <dig>  no change in the isoform ratio was seen when β-catenin was downregulated by sirna , implying that the change in trak <dig> ratio observed was executed in a β-catenin independent manner.

immunohistochemical staining of tcf <dig> and osbpl1a in matched normal and tumor tissues
to address whether the change in mrna isoforms had impact on protein expression, immunohistochemical  analysis of tcf <dig> was performed on a tissue microarray  containing  <dig> normal mucosa and  <dig> matched adenocarcinoma samples with an antibody specific for an epitope present in both the long and short variant. the ihc revealed a significant increase in both the nuclear staining  and in the percentage of stained cell  in cancer compared to normal samples . this could be explained by the de novo synthesis of the short tcf <dig> isoform in a subset of cancers, as the mrna encoding the long variant was expressed at equivalent levels in normal and cancer samples. however, this may also reflect other different properties such as a difference in stability of the two isoforms. we observed only very few stained cells in the cancer stroma, corresponding to the weak expression of the short tcf <dig> mrna isoform detected in lcm tumor stroma samples.

osbpl1a ihc staining was performed on the tma described above with an antibody targeting a peptide found in both transcript variants. this showed a significantly higher cytoplasmic staining intensity in normal epithelium compared to cancer cells , whereas no difference in the percentage of stained cells was observed due to the pervasive expression of osbpl1a in both normal and cancer tissue . this was in agreement with our mrna expression levels as the short osbpl1a variant is downregulated in cancer samples, whereas the long osbpl1a variant was expressed at similar levels in the normal and tumor samples.

tcf <dig> protein expression is associated with recurrence-free survival
to investigate the association between recurrence-free survival and tcf <dig> or osbpl1a expression, we used a tma containing biopsies from  <dig> stage ii adenocarcinomas. both the intensity of tcf <dig> and osbpl1a and the percentage of stained cells were tested for association to recurrence-free survival. a very good inter-observer agreement was seen for all tested ihcs , and we found that tcf <dig> staining intensity was significantly associated with progression-free survival  when data was dichotomized with the respect to strong intensity samples versus negative/weak/moderate intensity samples. kaplan-meier curves for tcf <dig> staining intensity  showed an increased recurrence rate for patients with biopsies that have a strong tcf <dig> staining. no significant association to recurrence-free survival was observed for the two osbpl1a ihc staining parameters or the percentage of cells positive for tcf <dig>  univariate cox regression analysis was implemented to examine the influence of each of the clinical parameters on progression-free survival, and we found tcf <dig> nuclear intensity to be significant . finally, multivariate analysis was performed including tcf <dig> nuclear intensity and the number of lymph nodes examined, and we found tcf <dig> nuclear intensity to be independently associated with progression-free survival .

in silico protein predictions
the potential structural and functional differences between the differentially expressed isoforms were analyzed using various in silico protein function and structure prediction tools, regulatory elements in untranslated regions  prediction tools along with already reported experimental data  <cit> . the results are summarized in table  <dig>  where the number of amino acids unique to the long or short variants is listed along with which protein domains are encoded by the unique amino acids, the presence of leader peptides and 5'utr domains. notably, significant functional differences are predicted between the long or short isoforms of tcf <dig>  osbpl1a, trak <dig>  chek <dig>  ank <dig>  lmo <dig> and scin indicating that the observed tumor associated changes in tss usage probably have an impact on the growth properties of the neoplastic cells.

discussion
this study reports the results of a genome-wide screening for alternative tss usage between normal and neoplastic colorectal samples. in total, we identified nine genes with alternative tss usage and validated them in an independent cohort. a subset of the candidates was validated by qrt-pcr on the rna used for array analysis and on rna from lcm samples. tf binding analysis suggested that p <dig> and sox <dig> might be responsible for altering the tss use as they are both upregulated in cancer and have enriched binding sites in the promoters associated with the tss preferred by the neoplastic cells. disruption of wnt signaling using two different crc cell lines further showed that perturbed wnt-signaling may also play a role in regulating alternative tss usage of osbpl1a and trak <dig>  maybe through sox <dig> which is known to be a wnt-regulated tf  <cit> .

the vast majority of scientific reports commonly refer to individual genes as one entity encoding a predominant transcript. this is a drastic oversimplification considering that experimental evidence supports the existence of at least two functional promoters for > 50% of all genes  <cit> , and, furthermore, it has the unfortunate consequence that potentially important transcriptional variants may be ignored. such transcript diversity is generated by various mechanisms such as alternative splicing, alternative tss usage and alternative polyadenylation usage, which generate families of transcripts from a single gene locus. additionally, the use of dna methylation appears to contribute to differential usage of alternative promoters in multiple tissue types  <cit>  as well as in cancer  <cit> . we have previously detected cancer specific alternative splicing in colorectal, prostate and bladder cancer  <cit> , and also shown that disruption of wnt signaling can change the splicing pattern in colorectal, lung and gastric cancer  <cit> . the findings in this paper extend these previous observations by providing specific examples of transcript isoforms that arise through tumor-specific alternative tss usage that occur not only in colorectal, but also in a wide range of other cancers. we have not addressed potential alternative splicing of tcf <dig>  osbpla <dig> and trak <dig> in this study, but have shown that the exon expression pattern and qpcr validation is consistent with alternative tss. in tcf <dig> and osbpl1a, the expression follows the pattern of already described short and long transcript isoforms, and for alternative splicing to explain this pattern, novel extreme 5' start exons would have to be included in the transcript of both genes followed by alternative splicing of at least eight otherwise constituve spliced exons, a scenario we consider highly unlikely.

for the transcriptional changes to impact tumor cell growth, it is crucial that they translate into protein changes. we used two different strategies to address this issue. first, ihc analysis showed a significant difference in the total protein level of tcf <dig> and osbpl1a between normal and cancer samples consistent with the mrna expression pattern we observed. furthermore, we found a correlation between the total tcf <dig> protein expression level and progression free survival. we did not perform ihc analysis of trak <dig> as a recent study already reported that elevated levels of trak <dig> are associated with poor prognosis in crc patients  <cit> . second, in silico analysis was used to predict the impact of an altered tss on protein function, and we found that osbpl1a has  <dig> phosphorylation sites and protein interaction domains that are unique to the long isoform, indicating a loss of function for the short isoforms. the long tcf <dig> variant encodes  <dig> glycosylation and yin-yang sites along with  <dig> phosphorylation sites not present in the short isoform. however, both isoforms contain dna binding and dimerization domains, indicating separate functions of the isoforms, and not a simple dominant negative function of the short isoform. indeed, both the long and short isoform of the tcf <dig> have previously been described as having distinct functions in thymocyte development  <cit> . deregulation of tcf <dig> has recently been causally implicated in crc in a dna transposon based forward genetic screen in a mouse model. interestingly, in this study, tcf <dig> was the fourth most commonly mutated gene locus   <cit> . this clearly indicates that tcf <dig> could have an important effect in crc development. in silico predictions for the remaining candidate genes indicated diverse functional differences such as altered protein localization, changes in protein-protein interaction domains and differences in translational regulation and efficiency.

the selective use of alternative tsss has been observed in different cell types, tissue types and developmental stages  <cit> , however, the mechanism regulating the alternative tss usage is often less well described. aberrant tss usage has also been linked to cancer, and in vitro studies of hypoxia in a crc cell line revealed hundreds of genes with altered tsss  <cit> . to elaborate on the possible mechanisms regulating the alternative tss usage in crc, we combined tf binding site enrichment analysis and tf expression analysis and showed that several tfs were dysregulated in tumors along with having enriched binding sites in the tss regions. furthermore, we used cell line models to demonstrate that abrogation of wnt signalling leads to altered tss usage for osbpl1a and trak <dig>  showing that the major pathway in crc development could be a key regulator of tss usage.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of alternative tsss is a widespread phenomenon in human genes, and by using exon array analysis, we identified nine genes with differential expression of isoforms between normal and tumor samples arising from differential tss use. the changes observed for chek <dig>  osbpl1a and tcf <dig> were confirmed in several other cancer types indicating that the change in tss usage is a general mechanism in cancer biology. the shift in osbpl1a isoform ratio was experimentally shown to be regulated by the wnt pathway, which is deregulated not only in crc, but also in many other cancer types. a tcf <dig> short variant was found to be de novo synthesized in colorectal tumors, and tcf <dig> protein level was shown to be associated with progression free survival, further underlining the potential importance of alternative tss usage in cancer development.
