BACKGROUND
maize  is a member of the gramineae family. it has a relatively large genome size of  <dig>  mb, which is comparable to the human genome  <cit> , but is larger than some other grass plants,  <dig> mb for rice and  <dig> mb for sorghum  <cit> . the genome sizes of many plant species differ according to the amount of repetitive dna  <cit> . in maize repetitive sequences are estimated to comprise well over 50% of the genome  <cit> . maize is a challenging target for genome analysis because of its large genome size, duplication of genomic regions  <cit> , low percentage of single-copy dna, and high retro-element content  <cit> .

integrated genetic and physical maps are extremely valuable for positional cloning of agriculturally important genes, comparative genome analysis, studies of chromosomal organization, and clone-by-clone sequencing. various methods have been developed for integrating genetic and physical maps of complex genomes. hybridization-based screening can be performed using high-density filters of large insert clones and radioactively labeled cloned dna fragments, pcr-amplified products, or dna oligonucleotides. more recently, overgo hybridization probes resulting from annealing of two overlapping oligonucleotides  have been employed to generate bac contig maps  <cit> . this technique has an advantage over the conventional oligonucleotide probe hybridization method, because the probes are slightly larger, providing improved hybridization kinetics and specificity. however, hybridization-based screening approaches have several limitations over pcr-based screening methods. the presence of repeat elements in the labeled probe often confounds hybridization results,  <cit>  and the procedures are more cumbersome since they involve radioactive material.

pcr-based screening of large insert libraries based on sts markers provides an alternative to hybridization-based screens. the efficiency of pcr-based screening can be improved by pooling clone libraries in specific ways. once pooled, clones containing particular sequences can be located by identifying the subset of pools containing the corresponding sts markers  <cit> .

bac pools are also an alternative to the use of radiation hybrids since both approaches obviate the need for dna polymorphism in mapping loci to their chromosomal locations at high-resolution. however, the bac pool and radiation hybrid approaches have some differences. for example, individual chromosome segments in bac pools tend to be smaller, giving finer map resolution, and individual bac pools tend to contain a larger number of unlinked chromosome segments than individual radiation hybrids, which increases the likelihood of false positive associations  <cit> . the increased rate of false positives can be overcome by using pools with six dimensions instead of the conventional two or three dimensions  <cit> .

in this study, we describe an approach to integrate the maize physical and genetic maps by using pcr-based sts markers generated from maize sequences to screen bac dna pools. the resulting data were analyzed together with bac fingerprint data in fpc for contig assembly  <cit> . the integrated map arising from this data is displayed in imap  <cit> .

RESULTS
pooling strategy
the pooling design is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the pooling method used was modified from the one used in sorghum  <cit>  to accommodate the larger genome size of maize . a total of  <dig>  bac clones were pooled in six distinct directions to generate  <dig> unique pools  containing  <dig>  clones .

contig assembly and anchoring via high-throughput pcr screening of pools
dna pools were screened with  <dig> pcr-based sts markers to identify overlapping bac clones. all  <dig> primer pairs amplified products from total b <dig> genomic dna  that were assumed to represent a single locus in the maize genome for each primer pair. six bac clones on average are expected to contain the same locus in each dimension of the pools because each bac pool is about six genome equivalents . an average of  <dig>  bac clones were identified per sts marker screened on the bac dna pools . seventeen out of  <dig>  markers gave no amplification products from the bac pools. this is surprising because a ~ 6Ã— library should have over 99% representation of all genome sequences.

data from the  <dig> markers with genetic map locations were used to analyze the number of contigs identified per marker  and to assess the anchoring of these contigs to the maize genetic map. of  <dig> markers,  <dig>  identified bacs within a single contig and  <dig>  identified bacs within two contigs. thirty markers  were identified within three or more contigs. three markers  identified bacs not included in the contig assembly due to fingerprinting failure. marker to bac relationships are provided. . using conservative anchoring rules  <cit> ,  <dig> markers  anchored contigs to their genetic position on the ibm  map.

markers that identified multiple contigs provide candidates for merging bac contigs and for distinguishing duplicated genomic regions. for example, p-umc <dig> identified bacs assembled within two contigs prior to manual editing of the physical map . these bac were located at the edges of the two contigs. at the high stringency used for maize contig assembly in fpc   <cit> , bac clones with a minimal fragment overlap such as these will not be placed in the same contig without additional marker information. the two contigs associated with p-umc <dig> were merged by manual editing based on agreement of pool data and hindiii fingerprinting data .

other utilities of bac pools
monomorphic markers
three different types of markers were used to investigate additional utilities for the bac pools. nineteen monomorphic ssrs were screened through the bac pools to determine their relative positions on the maize genome map by comparison with other anchored markers and to test the feasibility of bac pools as an alternative to radiation hybrid mapping.

all thirteen of the monomorphic ssr markers had marker:bac associations, twelve hit contigs that contain other genetic markers and twelve markers hit contigs that contain telomere or knob repeats . three markers identified bacs present in anchored contigs which are mapped to bins  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively.

markers with low recombination rates
ssr markers with a low recombination rate on the ibm genetic map were used to examine the resolution of the ibm genetic map. eighteen pairs of markers from five chromosomal regions were selected because the recombination rate between them is <  <dig> % on the ibm genetic map . their sequences were retrieved from genbank and used as queries in a blast search against all maize sequences to confirm that these linked ssr markers were not designed from the same gene. none of the markers represented the same gene or had significant hits to other adjacent ssrs. table  <dig> provides a summary of the contigs identified. five bins  containing markers with low recombination rates where contigs that were hit by multiple adjacent genetic markers were examined. in bin  <dig>  the following markers show a possible rearrangement in order from bngl1019--umc <dig> where the markers in parenthesis have the same map coordinate to bnlg1113-umc1777- where the markers in parentheses are on the same bac clone. data from markers in bin  <dig>  also suggested an order rearrangement from umc1941-umc1680-umc1542-phi087-umc2306-bnlg <dig> to umc1524-umc1680-umc1941-phi087-bnlg609-umc <dig>  in addition, umc <dig> and umc <dig> map genetically on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  cm. bac pool data indicates that the correct marker order for these genes is umc <dig> then umc <dig> 

surveying transcription factors from gene families
pcr primers designed from  <dig> transcription factors were used to demonstrate how rapidly a gene family of interest could be mapped to bac contigs and to evaluate the pools for studying duplicated regions of the genome . primers were designed to amplify locus-specific products. the transcription factors involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway have been extensively studied in maize  <cit>  but little information is known about the genetic map positions of many other transcription factors, especially for duplicated genes. all  <dig> transcription factors identified multiple bac clones within contigs . two pairs of paralogous genes, c1/pl and r1/b, generated by the duplication that occurred during the allotetraploid origin of the maize genome  <cit> , hit different contigs.

resolution of overgo hybridization ambiguities
sequences from which overgoes had been derived were analyzed against the unigene database by blast analysis to identify unigenes that contained an overgo and a genetically mapped ssr or rflp. a total of  <dig> overgo probes with in silico connections to mapped ssr markers that could not displayed on imap  were selected for this study. ssr markers associated with these overgo probes by in silico connections were screened through the dna pools to resolve overgo hybridization ambiguities and in silico associations . all  <dig> pcr-based markers identified at least one bac clone, compared to six  overgos with no positive bac. on average, pcr screening of bac pools and overgo hybridization identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  bac clones per probe analyzed, respectively. despite the fact that the overgo hybridizations were performed on a smaller subset of the hindiii bac library  compared to pcr screening on bac pools , the overgo hybridization identified significantly more bacs on average. this may result from repeat elements in the overgo probe hybridizing to multiple loci or a higher rate of false negatives in the pools compared to the overgo method. false-negatives were found in high frequencies in the pool dataset when the marker was present in ten or more pools of a given dimension . during deconvolution, these clones were occluded because they shared x, y, and z coordinates with at least one other candidate bac clone. seventy-one out of  <dig> pcr probes  identified subsets of clones found by overgo hybridization. this supports the in silico association data. the bac data from  <dig> out of  <dig>  pcr-markers successfully anchored bacs to genetic positions in contrast to the unsuccessful anchoring of all  <dig> markers based on overgo data alone.

discussion
we describe an approach combining a bac pooling strategy with pcr-based primer screening that can aid in physical map construction and provide anchor points to the genetic map. this methodology allows identification of overlapping bac clones while simultaneously establishing links between the bac contigs and the genetic map. the advantages of screening bac pool dnas with pcr-based primers include a low rate of false positives, low cost, and increased throughput compared to conventional hybridization techniques. although the use of this bac pooling strategy for integrated map construction was successfully demonstrated by klein et al <cit>  in sorghum, our study is the first report to show that bac pooling can be used for an organism with a larger genome and highly repetitive dna. in addition, the number of clones per pool reported here is higher than the pools used in other organisms:  <dig>  clones/pool  in human  <cit>  and  <dig>  or  <dig> clones/pool  in sorghum  <cit> . the six-dimensional pools also represent an alternative to the use of radiation hybrids for physical mapping. radiation hybrids have been constructed in maize however their utility for fine scale mapping is limited because of low resolution and marker retention frequencies  <cit> ; problems which are not present in the bac pools described here.

the average number of bac per marker was lower than expected,  <dig>  vs.  <dig> . this could be explained by; 1) lack of product amplification in one or more dimensions of the  <dig> pools , 2) failure to identify all clones of highly represented sequences due to occlusion, 3) no representation of the region the marker was designed from in the hindiii bac library, 4) absence of the locus within the subset of the bac library used to construct the bac pools, or 5) over estimation of representation in the bac library.

one hundred forty-nine of the  <dig>  markers with genetic map positions identified bacs assembled into single contigs providing unambiguous anchoring points. forty-two of the  <dig> markers that identified bacs assembled in more than one contig also anchor contigs to the genetic map. in total,  <dig> markers anchored physical contigs to their genetic positions demonstrating the utility of the bac pools as a powerful method to integrate the physical and genetic maps and to resolve conflicts caused by other anchoring methods. the results are displayed on imap  <cit>  and webfpc  <cit>  as a public resource.

the bac pools were also used to aid in refining marker order for closely linked genes on the genetic map, rapid mapping of gene families or duplicated genomic regions, and inferring positions of monomorphic markers by assigning to anchored contigs. furthermore, physical mapping of monomorphic markers allow us to infer the genetic map locations for these markers based on the genetic location of the linked markers from each bac contig. our preliminary results using markers with small genetic distances between them suggest that the relationships between genetic distance in centimorgans and physical distance in base pairs are not always parallel due to the difference in frequency of recombination along the chromosome. arabidopsis and rice studies reported similar observations  <cit> . the relationship between physical distance and genetic recombination can vary widely due to difference in recombination rates along the chromosome. minor genotyping errors can also cause incorrect marker order in small segments of the genetic map due to lack of informative recombination events. positional cloning studies rely heavily on closely linked markers that have unambiguous map orders. our results demonstrate that the maize bac pools offer a powerful tool for resolving gene in low recombination regions. in addition, although the local orders of markers are slightly different in the physical map compared to the genetic map, overall our results confirm the robustness and high-resolution of the ibm genetic map.

the data also demonstrates that the pools can be used for locus-specific contig assembly of duplicated genes, which is difficult using hybridization-based method. this information provides a significant aid to positional cloning of duplicated loci, to understanding biochemical networking and/or regulation between pathways, and for functional study of these transcription factors.

the data from  <dig> pcr-based markers associated with overgo probes by in silico methods allowed resolution of prior conflicts for 88% of the loci. however, the discrepancies caused by the rest of the data  suggest that, if ties between the physical and genetic maps are solely established by in silico connections and are contradictory with the pool data, then data produced from the pools should be given preference in anchoring contigs due to the low rate of false positives compared to hybridization-based approaches.

the pools provide a fast, efficient, cost-effective way to anchor contigs. the entire process from pcr to deconvolution of data can be completed in a day. only  <dig> pcr reactions per primer are needed to screen  <dig>  bac clones simultaneously at a cost of about $ <dig> per locus including labor. pcr-based screening of the dna pools provides anchoring points more quickly and more unambiguously than with traditional hybridization methods. approximately  <dig> additional genetic markers  will be needed to generate a completely integrated map for the maize genome. the bac pools will be screened with the rest of the publicly available mapped ssr markers and with single-copy rflp clones to achieve this goal. once a comprehensive anchored physical map is available the bac pools represent a robust, economical method to map genes or new sequences to the integrated map.

CONCLUSIONS
the six-dimensional maize bac pools were successful in assigning markers to bac despite the large genome size and amount of repetitive dna present. this suggests that a similar strategy can be employed in other organisms with similar genome structure. our data indicate that in addition to anchoring the genetic and physical maps, the pools can be used to define local marker order, resolve conflicting hybridization-based marker: bac assignments, and rapidly map duplicate factors or members of a gene family. use of the pools to obtain additional marker: bac associations in maize could speed assembly and validation of the fingerprint-based physical map.
