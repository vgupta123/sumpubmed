BACKGROUND
plants have developed complex defense systems to cope with and combat against harsh environmental stress. after environmental stress, e.g., chilly temperature, most plants gain or increase stress tolerance, resulting in stress acclimation  <cit> , <cit> . chilling acclimation is a favorable trait that is critical for plant growth, reproduction and survival. it helps defeat various chilling-related catastrophic outcomes, such as growth retardation, chlorosis, necrosis, and yield reduction  <cit> . chilling resistance can be further classified into above-zero temperature tolerance for tropical plants and sub-zero temperature tolerance for temperates  <cit> .

cold stress can be classified as chilling  and freezing  stress  <cit> . tropical plants can be injured by above-zero chilling temperature; chilling-injured leaves may become purple or reddish and in some cases wilt  <cit> . chilling responses of tropical plants has been documented: an oxidative signaling regulatory network triggers an early response to chilling stress in japonica rice  <cit> , and exogenous aba can induce freezing tolerance in chilling sensitive rice seedlings  <cit> . further, global expression profiling of chilling induced genes in the chilling tolerant japonica rice suggests a role of aba signaling in chilling tolerance  <cit> . fatty acid desaturation of organelle membrane lipids related acyl-lipid desaturase <dig> is required for chilling and freezing tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . a chloroplast-targeted protein complex stabilization related dnaj protein contributes to maintenance of photosystem ii under chilling stress in tomato  <cit> .

chilling response and chilling acclimation may alter gene regulatory circuitry  <cit> . however, the scale and mechanism of reprogramming of gene regulation as well as the molecular components involved remain to be investigated in important tropical crops, such as cassava. moreover, although small noncoding rnas , particularly micrornas , have been recognized as essential post-transcriptional gene regulators in plant development and stress responses  <cit> – <cit> , their functions in chilling acclimation have not yet been well documented.

most previous studies on chilling stress focus on model plants, typically arabidopsis and rice, whereas little has been done on euphorbia, a genus of tropical plants. many euphorbiaceous plants, e.g., cassava and castor bean, are agri-economically important. cassava  is a major source of carbohydrates for over  <dig> million people in the developing countries in the tropics and sub-tropics  <cit> . it is also a major source of industrial material, for biofuel production for example  <cit> , <cit> . cassava is remarkably tolerant to drought and low-fertility soils. however, it is sensitive to low temperature, and chilling injury often occurs in spring planting and autumn harvest seasons.

in this genome-wide study we analyzed transcriptome variations of cassava plants in response to chilling and during chilling acclimation, aiming at elucidating gene regulatory networks underlying chilling acclimation. specifically we compared the gene expression variations in responses to dramatic temperature decreases and during chilling acclimation in reference to the normal growth condition. we profiled the expression of protein-coding genes and sncrna species using next generation  sequencing. by analyzing more than  <dig>  million sequencing reads from  <dig> mrna libraries and  <dig>  million reads from  <dig> sncrna libraries, we identified differentially expressed mrna and mirna genes, from which we further identified and analyzed mrna and mirna genes that are critical to chilling acclimation.

RESULTS
exploring chilling response and acclimation in cassava
we profiled the transcriptome and micrornaome of sc <dig>  a widely planted cassava cultivar in china. sc <dig> is sensitive to chilling and can be exploited to study chilling response and acclimation. the profiling experiments were carried out under three chilling stress treatments : 1) gradual chilling acclimation  where plants grown in the normal condition of 24°c were stressed to 14°c; 2) chilling stress after chilling acclimation  where plants after 5 days of the ca treatment were transferred further from 14°c to 4°c; and 3) chilling shock  where plants were experienced a dramatic temperature drop from 24°c to 4°c . for comparison, plants grown continuously under 24°c were used as the normal control . total rna was extracted from three organs/tissues of the plants at the 6 h, 24 h and 5d of the corresponding stress treatments and the normal control in order to account for initial and secondary responses as well as functional adaption to chilling stresses.

distinct symptoms of chilling stress of cs and cca were observed at the end of these stress experiments . the cca treated plants were more chilling resistant than the cs treated plants at 4°c: fewer leaves wilted and more leaves stayed upright. four physiological traits were measured to further evaluate the impact of chilling stress . while there was no statistically significant changes in leaf falling , chlorophyll content only decreased in cs condition , malondialdehyde content  and leaf proline content  increased after one of the three chilling treatments. malondialdehyde content was progressively elevated with the severity of stress, from ca, cca to cs. proline content exhibited different variation patterns. it increased the most under cs and had the least variation under cca .

chilling stresses trigger significant transcriptome and micrornaome variations
in order to appreciate the impact of chilling stress, we profiled the expression of mrna genes and small-noncoding rna  species of sc <dig> after the ca, cca and cs treatments as well as under the normal condition  using illumina gaiix . overall ~ <dig> million  of raw sequencing reads from mrna genes, or rna-seq reads, were high-quality  reads, among which more than 80% could be mapped to the cassava reference genome  allowing one mismatch . with the criterion of at least  <dig> reads per million , the mapped reads attributed to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   mrna genes expressed under the nc, ca, cca, and cs conditions, respectively . comparing the numbers of these expressed genes showed that at least 19% more genes were expressed in any of the three chilling treatments than in the normal condition.

correspondingly, four small-rna libraries for the nc, ca, cca and cs conditions contributed more than  <dig>  million raw small-rna sequencing reads , among which  <dig> , <dig>  were adapter-trimmed, high-quality reads . among the qualified reads, which had lengths peaked at 21- and 24-nt,  <dig> % and  <dig> % could be mapped to the cassava reference genome allowing zero and one mismatch , respectively. based on a set of stringent criteria ,  <dig> novel mirnas from  <dig> mirna families were identified. in the total of  <dig>  mirnas that were detected,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed in the nc, ca, cca, and cs conditions, respectively .

severe and moderate stresses had comparable impact on transcriptome and micrornaome
among the three stress treatments, chilling shock  perturbed the transcriptome the most as it triggered the largest number of genes to express and had the largest number of differentially expressed  genes, detected by two stringent criteria , with respect to the normal condition  . the mild chilling stress, chilling acclimation , came in the second.

although ca and cs reached very different temperature – the former at 14°c whereas the latter at 4°c – the amount and extent of transcriptome variations that they had induced seemed to be comparable in terms of both expressed and differentially expressed genes. furthermore, there was only a strikingly small difference between the perturbed transcriptomes they induced. among the  <dig>  and  <dig>  de genes of ca and cs in reference to nc, respectively,  <dig>   were common. more specifically, among these de genes,  <dig> %  were down-regulated and  <dig> %  were up-regulated along the same direction in ca vs nc and cs vs nc. nonetheless, none of these de genes were regulated in the opposite directions under the mild and severe chilling treatments . in concordance, only  <dig> genes were de between the ca and cs treatments , further reflected by the similar expression patterns of the de genes in ca and cs . furthermore, the micrornaome variations caused by ca and cs, reflected by the de mirnas, were in concordance with that of transcriptome variations. a large portion of de mirnas of ca and cs were in common; in particular,  <dig> %  up-regulated mirnas were shared by ca and cs, and  <dig> %  down-regulated mirnas were common to ca and cs. it is important to note that neither de mrna genes nor de mirnas reversed their expression from up-regulation to down-regulation or vice versa between the cs and ca treatments .

these results on transcriptome variation were confirmed by a functional enrichment analysis; the two chilling treatments perturbed biological processes of similar functions . most of the enriched biological processes of the de genes of cs and ca with respect to nc were in common, which included translation , photosynthesis , l-serine metabolic process  and various other metabolic processes. it is not surprising to observe that the two sets of de genes share common enriched biological processes, because more than half of these genes were in common. indeed, translation , photosynthesis , and l-serine metabolic process  are also enriched in these  <dig>  common de genes . nevertheless, the stress-specific de genes, i.e., de genes that were specific to ca vs nc  and that specific to cs vs nc , were also enriched with the same biological processes as the commonly shared de genes. for example, translation  was enriched in the de genes specific to ca vs nc and photosynthesis  was enriched in the de genes specific to cs vs nc . in short, these results suggested that ca and cs perturbed similar biological processes.

chilling after chilling acclimation reversed the expression of a large portion of de genes
in stark contrast, chilling stress after chilling acclimation  altered the transcriptome the least among the three stress treatments despite that it ultimately reached 4°c as cs did. surprisingly, the number of de genes of cca with respect to nc was approximately one third of that of cs or ca . further,  <dig>  genes were de between cca and cs and  <dig>  genes were de between cca and ca, which are eight times more than the  <dig> de genes between cs and ca .

in order to appreciate the role that chilling acclimation plays in stress response, we compared the de genes and de mirnas of ca and cca. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were de in ca and cca with respect to nc, respectively. this more than  <dig>  fold difference between the two sets of de genes alluded to a genome-wide transcriptome alteration after stress acclimation in that harsh stress after chilling acclimation reversed the transcriptome changes triggered by the moderate chilling stress. indeed, the expressions of about two thirds of the up- or down-regulated genes in ca with respect to nc were, respectively, reversed to down- or up-regulated in cca with respect to ca . among the  <dig>  up-regulated genes after the initial temperature decrease from the normal condition to ca at 14°c,  <dig>   changed to down-regulated when going from ca to cca at 4°c; likewise, among the  <dig>  down-regulated genes after going from nc to ca,  <dig>  genes reversed to up-regulated after going from ca to cca . in contrast, even though the temperature kept decreasing from ca to cca, only  <dig> down-regulated gene was further down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes were further up-regulated .

interestingly, mirnas might be responsible for the reversion of some of the de genes to their original expression levels. specifically,  <dig> and  <dig>  mirnas that were down- and up-regulated from nc to ca reversed, respectively, to up- and down-regulation going from ca to cca; furthermore,  <dig> %  of the de mirnas reversed their expression directions . importantly, these  <dig> de mirnas targeted  <dig>  mrna genes, among which  <dig> were de and reversed their expression directions going from nc to ca and to cca . this observation suggested that  <dig> mrnas with the reversed expression levels might be negatively regulated by the  <dig> de mirnas, which also have reversed expression patterns. the  <dig>   reversely regulated de genes in the treatments from nc to ca and then from ca to cca have enriched biological processes such as translation , superoxide metabolic process , and mismatch repair  . we experimentally tested  <dig> of the reversely regulated genes related to translation  using qrt-pcr . the reversed expression patterns of these  <dig> translation-related genes are consistent with the rna-seq data and can be confirmed by qrt-pcr assay both under ca/nc and under cca/ca in the corresponding regulation direction regardless of the magnitude .

chilling acclimation prepared the plant to fend off adverse effects of further stress
the significant transcriptome and micrornaome changes, which reversed most de genes and a substantial number of mirnas in chilling after chilling acclimation, were in concordance with the mild symptoms of chilling stress of cca in comparison with the symptom of cs . this suggested that as the temperature further decreased to 4°c after the initial moderate stress, the plant was able to better adapt to further harsh stress and effectively recover some of the perturbation to biological processes or pathways that had been altered. in other words, stress acclimation  helped the plant develop a kind of immunity against adverse impact of chilliness at 4°c. moreover, mirnas played a role in this process by regulating the expression of some mrna genes.

a direct comparison between the transcriptomes of and the biological processes affected by cca and cs further confirmed our observation. even though both the cca and cs treatments reached the same temperature of 4°c, plants that had experienced chilling acclimation at cca exhibited drastically different transcriptome from plants that had subjected to cs. similar to the difference between ca and cca, there was also a huge, more than  <dig>  fold, disparity between the number of de genes of cca  and that of cs  with respect to nc . only  <dig> of these de genes were common in both chilling treatments, while  <dig> %  of them were specifically de in cca vs nc and  <dig> %  of them were specifically de in cs vs nc . this indicated that the degree of transcriptome perturbation due to cca and cs were substantially different. the functions of the two sets of de genes for cca and cs helped reveal the different biological functions of the common and condition-specific genes . as expected, many biological processes, such as metabolic process and responsive to stimulus, were perturbed under both chilling conditions since  <dig> de genes were common to both cca and cs . however,  <dig> biological processes  were not present in the common genes but exclusively appeared in the cca/cs specific genes. these genes function in  <dig> different cellular components . the  <dig> biological processes, which were either associated with the anabolic, growth-promoting state or the catabolic, growth-suppressing state, play a key role in leading cassava to distinct responses under the cca and cs treatments. the cellular components of these cca/cs specific de genes are closely related to membrane rigidification caused by chilling stress.

in addition, one molecular function was specific to de genes in cca and one biological process was specific to cs . the term nutrient reservoir was only present in de genes in cca condition, suggesting their possible protective activities in plants undergone chilling acclimation. two rmlc-like cupins superfamily protein-coding genes  were associated with nutrient reservoir. they were expressed at normal expression levels under the cs condition, but in contrast, they were overexpressed  <dig> folds under the cca condition with respect to nc . in contrary, the cs treatment triggered the process of viral reproduction, which did not appear in the cca treatment. from the rna-seq data, eight de genes were associated with viral reproduction, and six out of these eight de genes were overexpressed in both ca and cs, but expressed normally in cca. the other two genes were down-regulated by 5– <dig> folds in ca and cs, but were again expressed normally in cca. one up-regulated unannotated protein  and one down-regulated rop interactive partner  <dig>  were validated by qrt-pcr methods .

micrornas contributed to chilling response and stress acclimation
as a major post-transcriptional gene regulator, mirnas mediate the expression of their target genes in adaptation to environmental stress. to appreciate mirna functions and gain insight into the complex regulatory networks in chilling response in cassava, we exploited and combined the large collection of mrna and small-rna profiling data for an integrated transcriptome and micrornaome analysis. based on the small-rna profiling data, we identified  <dig> novel mirnas in cassava and  <dig> de mirnas in one of the six comparisons we considered .

we identified anti-correlated pairs of de mirnas and de mrna target genes in  <dig> comparisons across the stress conditions . the de mirnas played a role in regulating the transcriptome responses to chilling stresses. more than  <dig> mirnas regulated at least two potential mrna targets in each comparison. the regulatory effect of these de mirnas was most profound under cs with respect to nc and cca conditions . we further investigated the mirna-regulated de genes that were associated with the significantly enriched pathways in the pairwise comparisons among six conditions . these de genes were regulated by mirnas under at least one of the chilling stresses with respect to nc, while few of them were de across any of two stress conditions . biosynthetic process , cellular protein modification process , response to stress  and metabolic process  were the top  <dig> biological processes that had the largest ratios of genes being regulated by mirnas to the total number of genes on a given enriched pathway . as expected, one mirna can regulate one or several genes, and one mrna gene may be targeted by multiple mirnas. for example,  <dig> genes  targeted by mir <dig> were enriched in the same biosynthetic process in ca vs. nc, at the same time, one gene  enriched in oxidation-reduction process and  <dig> genes  enriched in metabolic process under cca vs. nc were all potentially targeted by mir396a/b/c/d, and novel- <dig> could target one gene  enriched in metabolic process under both cca vs. nc and cs vs. nc . surprisingly, one translation-related gene regulated by mir <dig> was differentially expressed in four comparisons: ca vs. nc, cs vs. nc, cca vs. ca and cs vs. cca, indicating that the interaction between mir <dig> and 018488 m played regulatory roles in ca and cs, but not in nc and cca. in short, mirnas are one of the key regulating factors during the processes of low temperature adaptation in cassava.

the effect of mirnas on their targets is reflected by the anti-correlated expression patterns between mirnas and their mrna targets because the major function of plant mirnas is mrna cleavage. we further experimentally tested  <dig> pairs of anti-correlated mirnas and target mrnas, as initially detected by the sequencing data . we first examined cleavage cites of mirnas on their target genes by 5′race . the cleavage sites of  <dig>  of the  <dig> pairs were validated and the cleavage sites were within the regions of mirna binding sites . as expected, many of these anti-correlated mirnas and mrnas were related to stress responses, such as novel16-pos, where pos is associated with scavenging hydrogen peroxide, and mir398-ec, where ec is supposed to maintain the membrane potential via electron carrier. therefore, these identified anti-correlated pairs of mirna and mrnas from the profiling data should be valuable candidates and subject to further investigation. nf-ya family, targeted by mir <dig>  has been recently found as an adaptive response to adverse environmental conditions  <cit> . note that the cleavage site of nfya <dig> by mir <dig> was indeed detected in our 5’race assay, while the anti-correlation between mir <dig> and nf-ya <dig> was not detected due to low reads number of mir <dig> in the rna-seq data .

§
the cleavage sites of  <dig>  mirna:mrna pairs were detected within mirna binding regions. five , three  and five pairs  of them were anti-correlated in the three chilling stress conditions with respect to the nc condition, in the other three comparisons and both two comparisons according to rna-seq data, respectively. the cleavage sites of the remaining four pairs  failed to be detected in the basepairing regions of corresponding target genes. the “*” column lists number of mirnas that are complementary with target cleavage sites in binding regions; the “+” and “-” symbols refer to cleavage sites located in upstream and downstream of mirna:target binding regions, respectively. in the “§” column, “+” means that there is an anti-correlation between a mirna and its target gene based on sequencing data, and the cleavage site of mirna:target is located in the basepairing region in 5′race assay, and “-” means that there is an anti-correlation in sequencing data, whereas the cleavage site of mirna:target is not within the basepairing region but either upstream or downstream to the basepairing region.

discussion
this is the first genome-wide, systematic study of chilling stress and acclimation in euphorbia; we integrated genome-scale, sequencing-based profiling data on protein-coding genes and mirnas on a chilling sensitive cultivar of cassava, the most important crop in the tropical regions. the study identified critical genes and mirnas are responsive to chilling stresses and gained insights into the biological processes underlying chilling acclimation. we expect our findings to have a potential impact on plant biology and agriculture. in particular, exposing tropical or subtropical crops to sub-optimal temperatures for stress acclimation can enhance their chilling resistance.

comparable effects of severe and moderate stress
based on a comparative transcriptome analyses of potato  and a. thaliana, carvallo et al.  <cit>  reported conserved gene expression patterns between the two species during chilling acclimation despite their independent evolution over  <dig> millions of years. in a large scale evolutionary studies across various species, preston and sandve  <cit>  further documented that despite independent development separated by evolution over hundred millions of years, some pathways and mechanisms involved in chilling acclimation are similar between bryophytes, monocots, and eudicots. as for different cultivars of the same species with contrasting responses to chilling stress, their comprehensive comparative studies reveal relatively similar initial transcriptional responses and more diverse downstream molecular changes. while functional categories for genes responding to late phase chilling stress are diverse, ranging from functional adaptation to continuous stress, the early responses have been found to be related to transcription regulation and signal transduction  <cit> . similarly, usadel et al.  <cit>  reported that arabidopsis has qualitatively similar responses to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 8°c, regardless the degrees of temperature change. we also confirmed this observation in our ca and cs experiments with similar disruptions to the transcriptome. moreover, we reported here that the chilling-sensitive cassava could trigger similar transcriptional responses when the cassava plant was subject to chilling stresses close to freezing temperature .

chilling acclimation helps plants better withstand severe chilling stress
our results revealed that the largest numbers of expressed and de genes appeared in the chilling shock  stressed plants. this suggested that a more severe transcriptome perturbation in cassava plants that had experienced dramatic temperature decreasing  compared to plants that were treated by mild chilling stress  and were stressed at same temperature after acclimation with mild chilling stress . surprisingly, more than 65% of the up- or down-regulated genes in ca vs. nc were respectively swapped to down- or up-regulation in cca vs. ca, indicating a remarkable reversing effect on gene expression and a dramatic rewiring of gene regulatory networks in plants after experiencing chilling acclimation. such antagonistic regulation patterns and regulatory network changes reflected plants’ profound adaptation to stress through the process of chilling acclimation.

in chilling sensitive plants, a major adjustment is the physical transition of cell membrane from a flexible liquid-crystalline to a solid gel phase, resulting in increased permeability that leads to cellular leakiness and ion imbalance. in cassava, significant accumulation of hydrogen peroxide  have been observed after 4 h chilling exposure; at the same time, the enzyme activities and up-regulation of four ros-scavenging transcripts, including catalase , superoxide dismutase , and glutathione transferase , have been observed and verified  <cit> . the enzymatic antioxidants, jointly with low molecular-mass antioxidants that were embedded in membrane and polyunsaturated fatty acids, respond to the oxidative stress. the balance of oxidative capacities and scavenging activities of antioxidants is broken as a consequence of abnormal metabolism and injured cells accumulating toxic metabolites and active oxygen species. in our study, oxidoreductase activity was significantly enriched in all of the chilling stresses compared to the control condition, indicating serious oxidative stresses. furthermore, the de genes that were specific to cs or cca significantly varied in the anatomical structure formation and cellular component. in addition to the fact that the chilling injury index  increased most significantly in the cs condition, it is viable to infer that transmembrane damage and membrane permeability have a significant variation between the cca and cs conditions. in addition, the processes of cell death and development were also significantly distinct between cca and cs , indicating that membrane and metabolism adjustment played an important part in the chilling acclimation in cassava.

we further experimentally validated some of the genes that reversed their expression patterns under further chilling stress after stress acclimation. ribosomal protein l <dig> and ubiquitin  <dig> were up-regulated from the nc to ca condition and subsequently down-regulated from the ca to cca condition . both genes related to ubiquitination can reduce protein synthesis for normal growth and provide diversity of small protein nutrient availability for the later chilling adaption  <cit> . in contrary, ribosomal protein l31e superfamily and zinc-binding ribosomal proteins, which are related to the growth of meristem tissue, were first down-regulated and then up-regulated from the nc to ca and subsequently to the cca condition. the expression pattern of these genes can help determine whether a cell is in an anabolic, growth-promoting state or a catabolic, growth-suppressing state  <cit> . two previous studies also found that low temperature can induce a large number of genes involved in translation, protein synthesis or nucleosome assembly when transferring from normal condition to sub-optimal temperature in arabidopsis <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . ribosome biogenesis is a key process for fundamental translation processes. perturbations to the dosage of the ribosomal protein subunits regulate overall protein synthesis related biological process  <cit> . the hydrophilic residues of ribosomal protein l <dig> can interplay with p53-mdm <dig> function complex  <cit> , <cit>  to stabilize and activate ribosomal protein-mdm2-p <dig> signaling pathway to response dna damage and ribosomal stress  <cit> , <cit> . those genes altering the accomplishment of normal translation initiation  <cit> , <cit> , elongation  <cit> , termination  <cit> , and probably ribosome-recycling  <cit> , are supposed to reduce the rate of protein synthesis. subsequently, carroll  <cit>  and gerashchenko  <cit>  reported that translational proteins have exquisitely sensitive and responsive to environmental fluctuations. furthermore, ferreyra  <cit>  argued that this widespread and unequivalent translational component reprogramming can have a “turnover” effect on related mrnas while inducing the translation of specific mrnas in adaptation to environmental stress.

in addition to translation reprograming, plant resistance to low temperature depends on responsive speed and scope of transcripts and metabolites involved in cryoprotection and stress responses. we identified two rmlc-like cupins superfamily genes specifically de in the cca condition with respect to nc. the rmlc-like cupins superfamily proteins have known functions in biology processes of small nutrient molecule, such as sulfur amino acid, polysaccharide metabolic process, amine and carbohydrate biosynthetic process. these metabolites have known oxidoreductase and disomerase activities  <cit>  and cation and hormone binding capacities  <cit> . they potentially help stressed plants to maintain normal osmotic potential and to defend water loss.

rop interactive partner  <dig>  was shown to significantly express in the cs condition, rop functions as molecular switches in auxin signaling at the cell membrane to regulate many cellular and developmental processes and environmental responses  <cit> . the balance between the activation and inactivation of rop helps maintain a non-toxic level of h2o <dig> to avoid lethal effects  <cit> . yun et al.  <cit>  report that early response triggered by oxidative signals is critical for prolonged survival under sub-optimal temperature and that many of the oxidative-mediated changes in gene expression occur within 24 hours of stress. their transcriptome variations have striking similarities to the transcriptome variations observed in plants’ responses to disease, pathogen infection and wounding, where de genes are involved in redox regulation. significant down-regulation of rops may contribute to the imbalance of redox regulation, resulting in effects similar to viral invasion, which may be critical for enduring transient exposure to mild chilling stress. since rmlc-like cupins can recruit genes with functions of nutrient reservoir for adapting to a lower temperature under the cca condition and rop genes lead plants to a catabolic, growth-suppressing state under the cs condition, the differences in the regulation of these positive and negative affecting genes may potentially cause the difference in chilling tolerance between the cca and cs conditions.

above-zero chilling resistance after chilling acclimation
by a conventional standard, chilling acclimation is the process by which plants acquire freezing tolerance through exposure to suboptimal, low, nonfreezing temperatures. plant species vary widely in their abilities of chilling acclimation. the chilling-sensitive species, such as tomato and rice, may be unable to be acclimated to acquire freezing tolerance. however, chilling resistance should not be limited to sub-zero temperatures, especially for tropical and sub-tropical crops. although being intolerant to freezing, they should be able to tolerate a much lower chilling temperature after chilling acclimation. this increased chilling resistance can allow tropical crops to withstand more severe chilling stresses than before. unfortunately, little has been done in the past to address the impact of above-zero chilling resistance.

cbf  genes are known to be ubiquitous and have conserved structures and functions in a wide range of plant species, including tropical and temperate plants  <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  as well as other plants  <cit> , <cit> . all four cbf genes in arabidopsis, in which cbf <dig>   <dig>   <dig> are cold inducible and cbf <dig> is drought inducible, are arranged in tandem in the arabidopsis reference genome  <cit> , <cit> . in cassava,  <dig> cbf homologues can be identified through a sequence search with an e-value less than e− <dig>  it is perplexing that despite having such a large number of cbf-like genes, cassava is unable to withstand freezing temperatures. nevertheless, cassava can endure chilling temperatures to some extent, particularly after chilling acclimation as shown in our study. it is interesting to observe that none of the  <dig> mirnas , detected by our deep sequencing data, targeted any of cbf genes. furthermore, these cbf genes, as well as the homologues of cbf constitutive activator ice  <cit> , <cit> , had insignificant expression variation in chilling treatments partly due to their low expression levels. those results are consistent with the results from an early cassava chilling study  <cit> , suggesting that the cbf regulon in cassava may be different from its counterparts in arabidopsis. on the other hand, not being chilling responsive at the transcriptional level did not mean that the cbfs were not responsive to chilling stress because cbfs may also be subjected to ubiquitination and sumoylation regulation at the translational and posttranslational levels, as shown in arabidopsis <cit> – <cit> .

the overexpression of ssdreb <dig> in arabidopsis could result in chilling-regulated gene expression and freezing tolerance  <cit> . conversely, constitutive overexpression of either lecbf <dig> or atcbf <dig> in transgenic tomato plants does not provide a detectable freezing tolerance  <cit> . the regulatory functions of the cbf regulon may be similar, but the whole cbf chilling-response pathway could be different between the tropical and temperate plants and the other plants. one clue to understand this difference may come from the upstream regulation components. there are probably different upstream motifs of the cbf regulon and some other transacting components in the regulatory elements of the cbf genes. another possible reason can be attributed to the genes downstream of the cbf regulon, which lack functional crt/dre elements in the promoters of genes that are required in order to affect chilling acclimation response or freezing tolerance. as zhang et al.  <cit>  suggest that differences among plant species with respect to the dreb/cbf regulon could be due to limited dre/crt-like elements in the genomes of chilling sensitive species, which may be the case for rice. the upstream regulation elements, such as cis-regulatory motifs and trans-factors, should be further examined in the de gene identified in our study.

mckhann et al.  <cit>  analyze the cbf genes and their promoters diversity in the arabidopsis versailles core collection containing  <dig> accessions that maximize the naturally occurring genetic diversity, and found polymorphisms in the cbf genes along with differences in cbf and cor gene expression. although there may be more cbf and cor gene expressed in tolerant accessions, there is no simple correlation between cbf regulon and chilling tolerance. by selecting another closely related solanum species that differs in its chilling acclimation ability, thomashow and colleagues  <cit>  find that both tested species altered gene expression in response to low temperature to similar degrees with similar kinetics and that both plants have cbf regulons composed of hundreds of genes  <cit> . these two studies, along with our finding that there was few mirna or mrna related to the cbfs’ response to the three designed chilling stress treatments, suggest that a complex network of genes are involved in the chilling acclimation  <cit> – <cit> , and that the cbf genes alone cannot explain all phenotypic differences. it suggests that more investigation is required in addition to the cbf regulon, e.g., metabolite networks that are related to low temperature tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the transcriptome and micrornaome profiling and the integrated analysis provided three important observations. first, substantial chilling stresses, regardless whether they were severe  or moderate , could lead to comparable transcriptome and micrornaome variations and cause perturbation to biological processes of the same or similar functions. second, dramatic temperature decreases and further temperature decreases after chilling acclimation could result in drastically distinct transcriptome and micrornaome variations even though both stresses reached at the same temperature of 4°c. third and most importantly, chilling-sensitive cassava could be accustomed to, through stress acclimation, severe chilling stresses close to freezing temperature  at least for a short period of time . this might be achieved by reversing the expressions of a large number of affected genes, which may potentially alter the regulatory networks, specifically by inducing or overexpressing genes that help preserve nutrients that are critical for stress tolerance.
