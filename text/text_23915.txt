BACKGROUND
unravelling processes that underlie population divergence is a crucial step towards elucidating the origin and maintenance of biodiversity  <cit> , and towards understanding the genetic basis of speciation, which is one of the most fundamental goals in evolutionary genetics  <cit> . however, there is still much to be learned about how divergent populations adapt to different environments under the effect of natural selection, which ultimately may evolve into biological species  <cit> . the new "omics" technologies, despite being very young, can contribute to this since they have taken up a very important position in the biological scientific landscape during the last decade  <cit> . actually, in the current postgenomic era, researches can now not only determine the genome of the organisms of interest, but also the transcriptome, the proteome and their relationships and characteristics even over time. genome-wide surveys of patterns of gene expression, for example, can help by revealing the functional importance of correlations between gene expression and the development of a phenotype  <cit> . moreover, evolutionary shifts in gene expression profiles could be used to explore genetic targets involved in local adaptation and ecological speciation  <cit> .

the development of microarray technology has revolutionized the study of expression profiles since scientists can study tens of thousands of genes at once. however, its utility has been restricted to organisms with extensive cdna or genomic dna sequence data available and, of course, any key question in ecology and evolutionary biology cannot be solely addressed using model organisms  <cit> . a useful alternative technique for transcriptome profiling is cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis , a modification of the original genomic dna-aflp  <cit> , by means of which accurate gene expression profiles can be determined by quantitative analysis of the peak  intensities generated  <cit> . it represents a reliable technique due to the highly stringent pcr conditions, and no prior sequence information is required. moreover, the mean variance of data is similar for cdna-aflp and microarray hybridization  <cit> . it also has the advantage over other gel-based methods that each selective primer combination displays a different subset of cdnas, thus facilitating experimental replication of genome-wide expression patterns  <cit> . the cdna-aflp technique has been broadly used in plants to identify genes involved in defence, resistance, sterility, adaptation or acclimation to contrasting environments, and to study the heritability of the intensity polymorphisms  <cit> .

on the other hand, quantitative pcr  is currently one of the most powerful and sensitive techniques for analyzing gene expression, being often used for validating output data produced by micro-and macro-arrays or other open expression systems. in order to avoid experimental errors arising from variation in the quantity and integrity of the rna template, as well as the efficiency of the cdna synthesis and pcr amplification, a normalization step is an essential pre-requisite. among the several proposed methods  <cit> , internal control genes , formerly called housekeeping genes, are most commonly used to normalize qpcr and to reduce possible errors generated in the quantification of gene expression  <cit> . such genes are supposed to be constitutively expressed at a constant level under various experimental conditions, in different tissues types and developmental stages. however, the assumption of a stable expression in every cell and tissue has proven false by a growing number of studies  <cit> . in fact, all genes seem to be regulated under some conditions, such that there is no single universal reference gene with a constant expression in all tissues  <cit> . therefore, a careful validation of the usefulness of potential reference genes is essential. to date and under our knowledge, only a limited number of reference genes have been identified in gastropods and none of them has been validated  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> novel candidate reference genes suitable for gene expression normalization were identified and validated in the marine snail littorina saxatilis  .

therefore, here we will use the cdna-aflp technique and qpcr to compare the expression profiles between two ecotypes of littorina saxatilis involved in an incomplete sympatric ecological speciation process  <cit> , in order to provide insights into the role of differential gene expression on ecological adaptation.

the marine snail littorina saxatilis has separate sexes, internal fertilization, and a brood pouch with non-planktonic shelled embryos. in the exposed galician coast , two well differentiated ecotypes are adapted to different shore levels and habitats  <cit> . the rb ecotype  lives on barnacles in the upper shore. this ecotype displays a larger and more robust shell to resist the attack from predators such as crabs, and a smaller shell aperture in order to reduce the desiccation due to high sunshine exposure  <cit> . the su ecotype  is found at the lower shore living on mussels. this ecotype shows a smaller and thinner shell with a wider shell aperture to allocate a relatively larger muscular foot providing a higher ability to avoid the dislodgment caused by the heavy wave action  <cit> . both ecotypes coexist in an intermediate habitat at the middle shore, where rb and su individuals meet and occasionally mate, showing an effectively sympatric ecotype distribution, and a partial pre-zygotic isolation barrier .

gene flow between ecotypes is only slightly restricted  compared to the level of gene flow among different populations within ecotypes  <cit> ; therefore the polymorphism observed is due to strong divergent natural selection acting across the environmental gradient  <cit> . thus, these two littorina saxatilis ecotypes represent an interesting system to study the genetic basis of adaptive ecological divergence at the transcriptional level in marine species. this work builds upon earlier genome-wide studies showing differences in dna sequence and protein expression between these ecotypes in the same population  <cit> , allowing a more global picture of the ecological adaptation process through the integration of different "omics" resources.

RESULTS
cdna-aflp analysis
a total of  <dig> biological replicates were sampled per ecotype across  <dig> different transects . each biological replicate included a pool of  <dig> adult snails . after total rna extraction, the quality of the rna was confirmed spectrophotometrically by the a260/a <dig> absorbance ratio that ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating a high purity for the rna extractions. for the cdna-aflp analysis, each sample was run twice . approximately, a total of  <dig>  transcripts  were obtained from  <dig> primer combinations using the restriction enzyme pair msei-taqi, with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  transcripts per primer combination. however, only  <dig> transcripts were shared in at least 90% of the biological and technical replicates, and therefore considered in the comparison between ecotypes.

the coincidence for the presence/absence data was compared by a coefficient of similarity, specifically the "simple-matching coefficient"  <cit> . thus, the coefficient across samples was  <dig>  . regarding the quantitative data, the averaged pearson correlation coefficient across samples was used to measure the reproducibility, showing the value of  <dig>  , which increased to  <dig>   when only the transcripts with significant expression differences were taken into account.

quantitative transcript differences between ecotypes were assessed using a three-way anova  on the normalized intensity data  obtaining  <dig> transcripts  with different level of expression between ecotypes ,  <dig> of them characterized by higher level of expression in the su ecotype. this percentage was reduced to 4%  when adjustment for multiple tests was performed. results do not change significantly when using a less restrictive cut-off criterion to select the peaks included in the quantitative analysis. when considering those peaks present in at least 80% of replicates ,  <dig> % displayed expression differences between ecotypes after the three-way anova, and  <dig> % after the sgof  correction. thus, our 90% cut-off for peak presence among replicates can be considered as rather conservative, although we preferred to be stricter and more restrictive at the expense of having fewer but more reliable transcripts.

# loci showing significant expression between sexes of the rb ecotype  <cit> .

we represent the f value for the factors ecotype, transect, interaction, and nested considering the biological replicates. in rb and su, the means± standard errors of the rfu  are shown. the randomization anova  was analyzed on the mean trancript intensity across technical replicates. underlined probabilities were still significant after multitest correction by sgof  <cit> .

none of the transcripts with significant differences in gene expression between ecotypes were significant by the transect factor nor by the interaction. thus, differences in gene expression for these transcripts were related mainly with the ecotype, making them potential candidate loci. all the  <dig> significant cases between ecotypes were confirmed by a randomization anova using the averaged intensity data from the two technical replicates. here,  <dig> remained significant after multitest correction , and  <dig> of them  matched with those that were also statistically significant after multitest correction in the three-way anova . interestingly,  <dig> of these transcripts  matched with those that have been shown to display significant expression differences between sexes in a previous study performed in this same population  <cit> .

quantitative analysis and hierarchical clustering of the expression patterns revealed two well differentiated groups of transcripts behaving differentially between the two ecotypes . pools of individuals were correctly clustered by ecotype based on their expression profiles, showing a clear distinction between genes that were up or down regulated in the rb ecotype .

sequencing and identification of transcripts
six out of  <dig> transcripts with differential expression between ecotypes showed clear size differences with respect to the other fragments separated in the same aflp run, making easier their isolation for sequencing purposes. these were therefore isolated and cloned. pcr products obtained from several bacterial colonies containing the insert with the right size were sequenced. all inserts of a particular transcript size were found to be of identical sequence, except for a single heterozygous site in transcript  <dig> . thus, differentially expressed transcripts were not due to increased signal from the co-migration of non-homologous transcripts at a given size. the sequences obtained from the  <dig> isolated transcripts were compared against those present in the databases. after blast and tblast searches,  <dig> transcripts did not show any hit , whereas transcript number  <dig> showed significant hits . this transcript was identified as a known protein of littorina saxatilis: the cytochrome c oxidase subunit i . this gene seems to be over-expressed in the su ecotype. interestingly, this same coi transcript also displayed a differential gene expression between sexes, being higher expressed in males than in females  <cit> .

only hits with an e-value below 10- <dig> have been listed.

n/a: not applicable because these transcripts did not show any hit.

qpcr: gene expression stability analyses and ranking of selected reference genes
in order to validate this result, one of our main interests focused on elucidating which genes could be used as reference genes for qpcr. we selected  <dig> potential reference genes, and designed primer pairs for each one . these genes were chosen in this species because they were commonly used for other organisms or because their functional description indicated they might be useful candidate reference genes. within our means, special attention was paid to selecting genes that could belong to different functional classes, which significantly reduces the likelihood that genes might be co-regulated. all of them produced a single peak in the melting curve analyses performed following the qpcr. no amplification was detectable in the absence of template.

the expression stability of the set of candidate reference genes was examined by genorm software, which calculates, for each gene, a measure of its expression stability  based on the average pairwise variation between all genes tested. stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene allowed the genes to be ranked according to their m value   <cit> . all genes had a value below the genorm threshold of  <dig> , being theoretically good reference genes .

the genorm program, in addition to the gene stability measure m, computes a normalization factor  and assesses the optimal number of reference genes required for normalization. the pairwise variation  between two sequential normalization factors  are used to determine the necessity of adding the next more stable control gene for reliable normalization  <cit> . pairwise variations were calculated using genorm for each data set to determine the optimal number of internal control genes for normalization . as reported by vandensompele et al.  <cit> , a threshold value of  <dig>  for this pairwise variation  was adopted. since the v2/ <dig> value  was  <dig>   while the v3/ <dig> value was very similar , it can be concluded that normalization using only the  <dig> most stable reference genes  would be sufficient.

coi expression
in order to validate the differential coi expression detected with the cdna-aflp technique, primers were designed to amplify coi. the pcr product was isolated and sequenced, confirming its identity . then, qpcr analyses were carried out using  <dig> new biological replicates per ecotype . to determine the reproducibility of the qpcr method, these samples were analyzed in two consecutive days to obtain two technical replicates that were used to compare their raw cq  values for tubulin . once a good reproducibility was obtained, the confirmation of the differential coi expression was assessed using the  <dig> biological replicates, and tubulin and histone as reference genes for the normalization. the raw cq values obtained for coi were transformed to relative normalized quantities using the cq values for histone and tubulin by the software qbase. after randomization, a significant differential gene expression was confirmed using one-way anova , confirming a higher expression in the su ecotype , as showed in the previous cdna-aflp analyses.

discussion
gene expression variation is widespread among individuals and taxa, has a heritable component, and it is subject to influence by natural selection and genetic drift  <cit> . therefore, transcriptome analysis should provide insights into which genes are "important", besides being a common way of discovering differences in gene expression because regulation of gene activity occurs primarily at the transcription level  <cit> . in this study, we used a new variant of cdna-aflp technology to analyze differences in gene expression between two ecotypes of the marine snail littorina saxatilis, considered an example of incomplete ecological and sympatric speciation. the experimental reproducibility obtained in this work for the cdna-aflp technique is in agreement with previous studies using this technology  <cit> . since a pooling strategy has shown previously similar efficiency to the individual strategy for gene expression comparisons  <cit> , we analyzed pools of  <dig> individuals  with the aim of reducing individual effects, thus increasing the power to detect differences between ecotypes. we found that about 4% of the studied transcripts  showed differences in expression between ecotypes. we note that our results would be conservative under a hypothetical scenario in which only one of the sexes contributed to expression differences between ecotypes, by averaging in each pool the input due to males and females.

although the cdna-aflp technique is an end-point pcr technique, we note that a crucial characteristic of the aflp technology is that it is semi-quantitative: the relative intensity of a pcr fragment band in an aflp fingerprint is related to the original abundance of that fragment in the aflp template  <cit> . even though alternative quantification techniques such as real-time pcr can be several fold more sensitive, our results should be considered for this reason as conservative. this is reinforced by the fact that our conclusions are based on the existence of consistent profiling patterns across both biological and technical replicates. thus, although small random differences at the start of the amplification may have a large effect on the final amount of pcr product, it is rather unlikely that these fluctuations can produce a repetitive systematic pattern across replicates. indeed, the probability of getting such a pattern by chance is negligible, as indicated by the anova analysis, even considering multiple testing.

similarly, any putative technical or biological problem associated to this study was resolved by using two complementary types of controls: first, using both biological and technical replication and showing differences in the biological replicates despite of the detected technical noise. second, gene expression differences between ecotypes were compared with those observed within ecotypes. so, any possible biases affecting our study should affect similarly to the within-and between-ecotype differentiation, while our results showed that significant transcript differences were observed exclusively between ecotypes.

the observed differences in gene expression could be heritable, caused by environmental effects linked to the different habitats associated to each ecotype, or result from a combination of environmental and heritable factors. nevertheless, a recent study has shown that much of the variation in mrna expression is related to genetic variation, and that only a minor part of this variation occurs in response to environmental changes  <cit> . similarly, previous studies indicated that most of the protein expression and morphological differentiation observed between the ecotypes in the same population were not plastic  <cit> . therefore, and even though it is obvious that environment has a role in gene expression, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that much of the variation found here could be at least primarily influenced by genetic factors, although the exact quantification of the extent of this genetic determination will require further experimental work comparing expression  differences in wild and laboratory-reared snails.

sorting or clustering genes into groups according to their expression patterns can provide a broad and interpretable overview of gene regulation  <cit> . here, we carried out a cluster analysis in order to identify sets of genes with common expression between ecotypes. we could clearly distinguish two different groups of genes differentially expressed which allowed clustering all the pooled individuals by their ecotype . these two sets of genes could represent different functional groups involved in similar metabolic pathways or, at least, similarly regulated, thought a future confirmation would be needed.

regarding the identification of the transcripts, most of the differentially expressed genes did not correspond to known sequences in the available databases. this could be due to the scarcity of gastropod sequences in public databases or, alternatively, these sequences may represent novel mrnas. another possibility is that they could correspond to the 3' untranslated region of the gene where the sequences are often less conserved than the sequences of protein-coding regions  <cit> . however, this possibility was reduced in the current study thanks to the modification applied to the original cdna-aflp protocol, in which the 3'-end tails close to the poly tail were discarded .

when analyzing gene expression data by qpcr, stability of candidate reference genes and an appropriate method of normalization must be carefully evaluated. an ideal reference gene should be expressed at a constant level in each sample, but nowadays it is broadly accepted that the ideal and universal reference gene does not exist  <cit> . unfortunately, for many organisms a large sequence dataset is not available, precluding the identification of genes whose transcripts are maintained at stable levels across the samples being surveyed  <cit> . in fact, this prior validation of reference genes remains uncommon in gastropods  <cit> , or even in molluscs, though with exceptions  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first effort aimed at the identification and validation of reference genes for gene expression in a marine gastropod. the recently developed miqe  guidelines  <cit>  suggest employing the geometric average of multiple reference genes and assessing gene stability with the support of validated mathematical models such as genorm  <cit> . even when there are few sequences available for l. saxatilis, we decided to discard β-actin gene, one of the most traditionally used in qpcr, for two main reasons: i) both ecotypes show differences in musculature ; ii) it has proven to have an unstable expression in several organisms  <cit> . according to genorm, the threshold m value for considering a gene to be unsuitable for data normalization is suggested to be ≥  <dig>   <cit> . in this study, the  <dig> tested genes showed m values below  <dig> , being possible good candidates to be used in the normalization. based on this estimates, genorm ranks the stability of the six genes in the following order: 18s < calmodulin < ef <dig> < ef <dig> < histone and tubulin. moreover, low values of the pair-wise variation v between two sequential normalization factors containing an increasing number of genes  showed it was unnecessary to include more than the two genes chosen by the genorm software: histone and tubulin . since these two genes are involved in distinct biological processes and metabolic pathways , have therefore a smaller chance of being co-regulated genes.

the analysis of qpcr profiles for the candidate gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit i  confirmed the results obtained previously by cdna-aflp. this up-regulation of the coi in the su ecotype could result both from an increased number of mitochondria in the su ecotype and/or changes in transcription rate per se. previous studies showed that higher levels of mtdna gene products under physiological stimuli are primarily met by mtdna replication . cytochrome c oxidase  or complex iv , is a large transmembrane protein complex found in bacteria and in the mitochondrion. specifically, subunit  <dig>  like subunits  <dig> and  <dig>  is a large and highly hydrophobic protein encoded in the mitochondrial genome  <cit> . cox is the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria . it plays a fundamental role in energy production of aerobic cells, and also contributes to the storage of energy in the form of an electrochemical gradient that will be used by the oxidative phosphorylation system for synthesis of atp  <cit> . changes in the transcription level of genes involved in energy metabolism have been reported previously, and are especially interesting since they may influence important traits  <cit> . as cox activity can be modulated according to the energetic requirement of the cell, its increase in su individuals could be related to a need of energy to avoid the dislodgement by the heavy wave action typical of their habitat. in fact, a very similar result was found in the same population at the proteome level  <cit> , where enzymes related with the energetic metabolism  were also up-regulated in the su ecotype. consequently, the provision of atp and the control of its metabolism seem to be critical components of the general environmental stress response in all organisms, allowing them to respond with adaptive physiological changes while, at the same time, buffering the changing energy demands  <cit> . the su individuals have to develop higher muscular effort than the other ecotype to be able to hold on the rocks while suffering the strong swell of their habitat  <cit> . therefore, increasing the energetic metabolism could represent a possible adaptive physiological mechanism underlying differential muscular effort between both ecotypes. future efforts aimed at determining whether this difference is due to environmental or genetic causes have to be made, for example studying its expression in individuals grown in lab conditions. similar results have been found between sympatric species of lake whitefish and brook charr, where genes involved in energy metabolism emerged as prime candidates underlying their adaptive divergence  <cit> . furthermore, and remarkably, the same transcript corresponding to the coi, together with the transcript  <dig> not identified, showed a higher expression in rb males versus rb females in a previous work  <cit> . a similar result was found in gene expression studies between sexes in drosophila spp, where males showed a higher degree of variation in expression in genes associated with mitochondria and defence functions  <cit> . this is of particular interest given that sex-biased genes, especially those genes with male-biased expression, appear to evolve faster and, therefore, develop a higher divergence between species  <cit> . taking into account that the sex dimorphism in size  is much more pronounced in the su ecotype than in the rb, the coincidence of genes participating in sexual and ecotype differentiation is plausible and raises the hypothesis that genes associated with the male reproductive function may contribute disproportionably to speciation, i.e. faster male theory  <cit> .

a major challenge towards a comprehensive analysis of speciation processes is the integration of data from different "omics" resources and their interpretation. even when we are very cautious and taking all the precautions due to the inherent differences caused by the distinct techniques, we could make a proxy of what is happening at three different biological levels. at genome level, both ecotypes differed around 3% in their genome by an aflp scan  <cit> , whereas the transcripts analyzed in the current study displayed 4% of gene expression differences. in general, it seems that there is a greater differentiation among organisms at transcriptome level than at genome level  <cit> , maybe due to a higher evolutionary rate of the transcriptome  <cit> , or to the epistatic and pleiotropic nature of the molecular mechanisms underlying gene expression  <cit> . on the other hand, the proteome level is the closest to the phenotype, and our previous results  <cit>  showed higher differentiation between ecotypes at the proteome level, that is around 7%. since the selection is acting at phenotypic level while variation is generated at the level of the genotype, the proportion of changes caused by selection can be expected to be largest at phenotypic level and smallest at the dna sequence level  <cit> , a view that seems consistent with the partial data we have available in the global analysis.

another central, and yet controversial, question in evolutionary biology concerns the genetic basis of evolutionary change. king and wilson   <cit>  proposed that the key to understand the differences among species is not in the gene-coding, but in the dna region that regulate the levels, locations, and time of gene expression. an important tenet of evolutionary developmental biology  is that cis-regulatory mutations are more important than structural mutations in phenotypic evolution  <cit> , although it is also argued that adaptations likely involve a mixture of structural and cis-regulatory changes  <cit> . here, the hypothesized increase of gene differentiation between ecotypes along the three different molecular levels could indicate a certain influence of the regulatory elements affecting to gene expression, but such hypothesis will need an independent corroboration. new sequencing effort will be necessary in order to improve our knowledge on the genetic architecture of adaptive traits in this model system.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have improved our knowledge of the role of differential gene expression on the ecological adaptation of the marine snail littorina saxatilis. our results show that at least 4% of the sampled transcripts are being differentially expressed between ecotypes adapted to alternative habitats, highlighting important differences in gene expression in the face of gene flow. a candidate transcript of such ecotype differentiation was identified as cytochrome c oxidase subunit i , which is up-regulated in the exposed ecotype. interestingly, coi is involved in the oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting an enhanced mitochondrial gene expression  to improve energy supply in the ecotype subjected to the strongest wave action, in the same way that those genes identified at proteome level  <cit> .
