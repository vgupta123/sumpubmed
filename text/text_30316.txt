BACKGROUND
both schizophrenia and addiction are thought to involve aberrant information processing in the nucleus accumbens , which makes up the ventral part of the striatal complex. in these disorders, changes in dopamine  release apparently induce alterations in the intrinsic circuitry, affecting coordinated thought and motivation  <cit> . the cellular substrate for da action in the striatal complex is remarkably homogeneous. ninety-five percent of nacc are medium-spiny gabaergic neurons . msns receive extensive excitatory input from cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and thalamus, feed-forward gabaergic inhibition from a small population of fast-spiking interneurons, and excitation from large aspiny cholinergic neurons  <cit> . msns give rise to a profusion of local axon collaterals that ramify within their dendritic fields, as well as to all the efferent projections from the nucleus.

in somatic recordings from striatal msns, whose properties are nearly indistinguishable from those of nacc msns, fast-spiking interneurons appear to be responsible for the majority of inhibitory input because they impinge on more proximal dendrites  <cit> , while msns impinge on more distal dendrites and therefore appear deceptively weak  <cit> . recent estimates have suggested that about two thirds of the gabaergic inputs to a given msn are intrinsic connections from other msns  <cit> . given both their number and probable strength, the intrinsic synapses of msns must have an important role in striatal information processing  <cit> .

considerable interest has focused on the targets of da action in the striatal complex  <cit> . msn-to-msn synaptic connections show potent da modulation. guzman et al.  <cit>  found that the intrinsic synapses were facilitated by d <dig> and inhibited by d <dig> agonists. however, nicola et al.  <cit>  and taverna et al.  <cit>  found the opposite for d <dig> agonists. such contradictory results might reflect differences in the compliments of da receptors on different msn axons. in fact, the hypothesis that da receptors might be differentially trafficked in the axon of msns was raised by surmeier et al.  <cit>  some time ago. however, all studies to date have been done with postsynaptic recording techniques that do not resolve single synaptic inputs. thus, heterogeneity in the distribution of da receptors has yet to be addressed directly.

to approach da modulation at the level of individual synapses requires a way to activate and monitor the synapses of a single neuron. this becomes possible by using patch pipets both to fill single msns with a ca2+ indicator dye and then to stimulate them. using this approach in combination with two-photon excitation laser scanning microscopy , which provides the requisite spatiotemporal resolution, we were able to monitor ca2+ transients at individual presynaptic varicosities as a proxy for synaptic action. we then used da receptor-selective agonists and da receptor knockout  mice to elucidate the modulatory actions of da. our results support the hypothesis that msns differentially traffic da receptors to presynaptic sites.

RESULTS
medium-spiny neuron intrinsic synapses function in the slice
parasagittal slices were made through the striatal complex and whole cell recordings obtained from msns in the ventral part of the complex, or nucleus accumbens . we isolated inhibitory connections using the glutamate antagonists cnqx  and apv . overall  <dig>  cells were recorded; of these,  <dig> cells had coplanar proximal axons with single or multiple hot spots of activity-dependent ca2+ responses. of these,  <dig> cells remained healthy, with reproducible ca2+ responses such that the control and post-drug responses varied by less than 5% over the course of the experiment, making possible the acquisition of a full data set.

in preliminary experiments, we tested the synaptic function of msn-to-msn intrinsic synapses . since msns make all the projections from the striatal complex to the ventral pallidum , a population of msns can be activated selectively by antidromic field stimulation in the vp  <cit> . this produced a complex ipsc, after a fixed delay of about  <dig> msec. antidromic action potentials were occasionally evoked in the recorded cell , suggesting that some projection axons remained intact in our slice configuration. the delayed ipsc component was completely blocked by the gabaa antagonist bicuculline, and largely recovered, indicating that the intrinsic synapses of msns do indeed function, and inhibit neighboring msns.

two-photon imaging of axonal varicosities in the slice
we patched msns with pipettes containing the ca2+ sensitive green fluorescent dye og <dig> and the ca2+ insensitive red fluorescent dye alexa <dig>  msn dendrites were easily recognized by virtue of their multiple spines, in contrast to the single non-spine bearing axon. proximal dendrites and spines filled within  <dig> min of achieving whole cell mode, while the axon required at least  <dig> min to fill , presumably because of its narrower bore. the single axonal process arose from the cell body and gave rise to several local axonal branches. one axonal branch extended beyond the confines of the dendritic tree to give rise to the efferent projection. in horizontal slices , we never imaged axonal ca2+ rises, while in parasagittal slices we were successful in about 25% of experiments. apparently, local msn axons were more likely to be intact if the projection axon extended some distance without being cut. with the favorable orientation of the recorded cell in the slice, up to five varicose expansions or varicosities, could be imaged simultaneously in the same focal plane. we focused on proximal varicosities located within the second order branches, where dye concentrations stabilized within  <dig> min and provided reproducible signals.

in 3d reconstructions of recorded cells, the mean distance from the cell body to the recorded varicosities was  <dig> μm, with a range of 34– <dig> μm. hot spots where ca2+ levels transiently increased with stimulation were distributed at irregular intervals along the axons and coregistered with varicose expansions – presumably synaptic varicosities – identified in the alexa  <dig> images. these expansions had the typical en passant appearance of presynaptic varicosities on unmyelinated axons  <cit> .

the major challenge in this study was recording ca2+ signals from the small synaptic varicosities of msns. generally, axonal signals are several-fold dimmer than signals in small dendritic branches  <cit> . while koester and sakmann  <cit>  were able to record single ap-induced ca2+ responses in the terminals of neocortical pyramidal cells, single ap-induced ca2+ responses were undetectable in msn varicosities, presumably because they were embedded in the noise.

to detect ca2+ responses, we adjusted the ca2+:mg2+ ratio to 3: <dig> , 2: <dig> or 2: <dig> . increasing the ca2+ concentration  yielded responses that became less reliable over time, presumably due to cytotoxicity. while normal ca2+ with reduced mg2+  both enhanced the amplitude of the ca2+ responses and maintained reliability, the zero mg2+ ratio  further enhanced responses, without apparent detrimental effects, and was therefore used for subsequent experiments. however, adjusting the ca2+:mg2+ ratio still not provide reliable single-ap evoked ca2+ responses, so we then moved to trains of depolarizing pulses. in a msn with a single proximal axonal varicosity , we found that ap-induced ca2+ responses  increased with ap number. the ca2+ response showed the characteristic fast rise and slow decay kinetics . the decay followed a single exponential. in three msns, each with one varicosity, all three varicosities showed a maximal  response with  <dig> pulses. trains of  <dig> pulses evoked sufficiently robust ca2+ responses that reached about 50% of the maximal level, and therefore provided the necessary dynamic range to measure both inhibitory and facilitatory effects. to minimize the contribution of the noise in the ca2+ measurements, we integrated the ca2+ responses . compared to measuring peak amplitudes, the integrated ca2+ response showed significantly less variability.

to demonstrate reproducibility of ca2+ responses measured in this way, we did repeated stimulation under control conditions , as shown in figure  <dig>  the recorded msn is shown in a projection image with the stretch of the axonal process with a single varicosity outlined . the corresponding og <dig> image  shows that the ca2+ response was spatially restricted to a short stretch that corresponded to the varicosity. a spline was superimposed  on the og <dig> image. the laser was repeatedly directed along the spline  to produce a temporal display of the og <dig> signal in response to a train of aps . there was no change in the ca2+-insensitive alexa <dig> fluorescence.

in one experiment, we measured ca2+ responses with repeated stimulation at  <dig> min intervals, which showed the relative stability of responses under optimal conditions . to test this further, we evoked a second, control ca2+ response in several cells. the second response was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of the first, control response . the distribution of second ca2+ responses did not differ significantly from the normal distribution . nor was it skewed . based on this analysis, changes of 5% or greater were deemed significant. pharmacological data were then classified as showing inhibition , no change , or facilitation . data were analyzed for modulatory actions of single agonists in experiments where ca2+ responses were stable for at least  <dig> min, and for multiple agonists in cells where ca2+ responses were stable for  <dig> min. invariably somatic action potentials triggered ca2+ responses in all imaged varicosities, consistent with prior observations  <cit> .

da modulation of individual msn varicosities in wild type mice
we used the d1/d <dig> selective agonist skf <dig>  and the d2/d <dig> selective agonist quinpirole  to examine da modulation of single msn synapses. in figure  <dig>  the recorded msn was rendered into a 3dimage, with the axon shown in red, the dendrites in blue and the scanned area outlined . the corresponding og <dig> image  showed that the stretch of axon contained five presynaptic varicosities. the spline used for scanning is shown superimposed on the axon. the spline scan images showed that the ca2+ responses or hot spots  corresponded to varicosities . hot spots # <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed the representative da response , namely inhibition with quinpirole , and facilitation with skf <dig> . hot spots # <dig> and  <dig> did not respond to quinpirole, but showed clear facilitation with skf <dig> 

as summarized in figure  <dig>  we recorded  <dig> varicosities from  <dig> cells with skf <dig> and  <dig> varicosities from  <dig> cells with quinpirole in wild type mice . overall, skf <dig> produced facilitation , while quinpirole produced inhibition  . as shown in the incidence data , skf <dig> nearly always produced facilitation, while quinpirole produced predominantly inhibition, but in some instances facilitation, and in others it had no effect.

studies in da receptor knockout mice
because quinpirole activates both d <dig> and d <dig> receptors  <cit> , the heterogeneity in quinpirole modulation might reflect differential effects at d <dig> and d <dig> receptors. to address this, we made slices from d <dig> single, d <dig> single and d2/d <dig> double knockout  mice  <cit> . in a d <dig> ko mouse , the area imaged contained a single hot spot that showed robust quinpirole facilitation , presumably d <dig> receptor-mediated. in a d <dig> ko mouse , the area imaged contained  <dig> hot spots. hot spot # <dig> showed significant inhibition , presumably d <dig> receptor-mediated, while # <dig> and  <dig> showed no effect .

as also summarized in figure  <dig>  quinpirole inhibition was apparently normal in d <dig> ko mice, while it was largely abolished in d <dig> ko mice , suggesting that the predominant inhibitory effect was d <dig> receptor-mediated. in d <dig> ko mice, the incidence of quinpirole inhibition was diminished , while the no effect incidence increased. however, quinpirole-mediated inhibition remained in d <dig> ko mice, suggesting that d <dig> receptors must also mediate inhibition. while the incidence of quinpirole-induced facilitation remained almost the same in d <dig> ko mice, it was undetectable in d <dig> ko mice. thus, d <dig> receptors appeared to mediate inhibition, while d <dig> receptors appeared to mediate either inhibition or facilitation. the incidence of quinpirole-mediated inhibition was slightly increased in d <dig> ko mice, which may reflect a compensatory increase in d <dig> receptor expression due to the lack of d <dig> receptors, as d <dig> and d <dig> receptors may exert feedback control on their expression  <cit> .

heterogeneity in da modulation
the correlation between the magnitude of skf <dig> or quinpirole-mediated modulation and the distance from soma to the recorded varicosities was subjected to regression analysis . for both skf <dig> and quinpirole application, the data were randomly distributed, showing no relationship to distance from the soma. in the experiments where we were able to image more than one varicosity on the same axon , heterogeneity in da modulation was readily apparent. to look for a spatial pattern more closely, we graphed da modulatory effects at individual varicosities as a function of their distance from the cell body in a bubble plot . in experiment  <dig>  where we tested both skf <dig> and quinpirole in wild type mice, hot spots # <dig> and # <dig> showed robust skf81297-mediated facilitation but weak quinpirole-mediated inhibition, while # <dig> showed robust quinpirole-mediated inhibition and weaker skf81297-mediated facilitation. varicosity # <dig> and the most distal varicosity showed equally robust skf81297-mediated facilitation and quinpirole-mediated inhibition. in experiment  <dig>  where we tested both skf <dig> and quinpirole in a d3ko mouse, the most proximal hot spot was unaffected, while the second showed only quinpirole-mediated inhibition, and the third showed both skf81297-mediated facilitation and quinpirole-mediated inhibition. thus, the relative responsiveness to d <dig> and d <dig> receptor activation varied considerably from varicosity to varicosity along the axon, with no proximal-distal pattern.

discussion
we examined da modulation of medium-spiny neuron synapses by visualizing activity-dependent ca2+ responses at multiple presynaptic varicosities on proximal axons of individual msns. ca2+ responses showed potent da modulation, with subsets of varicosities showing both d <dig> and d <dig> pharmacology. d <dig> receptors were almost exclusively facilitatory, while d <dig> receptors were inhibitory, and d <dig> receptors either inhibitory or facilitatory. along single axonal processes da modulation varied strikingly from varicosity to varicosity.

modulatory role of presynaptic da receptors
the d <dig> agonist skf <dig> produced reliable facilitation of presynaptic ca2+ responses, while the d2/d <dig> agonist quinpirole produced either facilitation or inhibition. this was consistent with our previous cell culture observations  <cit> , as well as recent observations in isolated striatal synaptosomes  <cit> . due to the lack of d <dig> receptors in the dorsal striatum  <cit> , the inhibition of synaptic currents with a d2/d <dig> agonist observed by guzman et al.  <cit>  was presumably mediated by d <dig> receptors. in the nacc, where d <dig> receptors are robustly expressed, dissecting d <dig> actions becomes more complicated.

given the limited selectivity of available d <dig> agonists, one approach might be to use da in combination with more selective than da antagonists  <cit> . however, there are potential confounds in such an approach, including instability of da, differential accessibility of da and da antagonists to receptors in the slice and limited reversibility of antagonists due to their lipophilicity.  <cit> . we therefore opted to use d <dig> and d <dig> ko mice. in d <dig> ko mice, the inhibitory effect of quinpirole was diminished, indicating that d <dig> receptors mediate inhibition. the facilitatory effect of quinpirole was eliminated in d <dig> ko mice, while it remained in d <dig> ko mice, indicating that d <dig> receptors mediate facilitation. however, some inhibition remained in d <dig> ko mice, indicating that d <dig> receptors may mediate either facilitation or inhibition.

we can discount a role for d <dig> receptors in the modulation of nacc msn synapses. results from in situ hybridization  <cit>  and immunohistochemistry  <cit> , which reveal d <dig> receptor expression in about 20% of msns, show negligible d <dig> receptor expression. no d <dig> receptor expression was seen in the striatum or nacc of drd4-egfp transgenic mice, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein  was introduced using bacterial artificial chromosome  technology and expressed under the control of genomic fragments flanking the d <dig> receptor gene locus  <cit> . electron microscopic immunohistochemistry revealed some d <dig> receptor expression in dendritic spines of a minority of msns  <cit> , consistent with physiological evidence that d <dig> actions are postsynaptic  <cit> . in two preliminary experiments in d2/ <dig> double ko mice , quinpirole had no effect, confirming that effects of quinpirole are mediated by d <dig> or d <dig> receptors, but not d <dig> receptors. thus, d <dig> receptors are unlikely to have a role in the presynaptic modulation of msns.

d <dig> receptors may mediate more heterogeneous actions as they are not robustly coupled to gi in many mammalian expression systems  <cit> . furthermore, the third intracellular loop, which is important for the g protein coupling, is highly divergent in d <dig> receptors with only a ~25% homology in amino acid sequence to the d <dig> sequence, suggesting a divergence in coupling. for instance, phosphorylation of g protein coupled receptors can switch them from gs to gi-coupled in an activity-dependent fashion  <cit> . it is thus possible that the coupling of the d <dig> receptor is not only more heterogeneous, but probably plastic.

co-localization of d <dig> and d <dig> receptors with distinct functions on intrinsic synapses
although the dominant view of da receptor expression in striatal neurons asserts strict cellular segregation  <cit> , several studies  <cit>  have suggested that d1- and d2-like receptors are co-expressed in single msns. here, we have shown that subsets of presynaptic varicosities d <dig> pharmacology, others d <dig>  and many both d <dig> and d <dig> pharmacology. this suggests a resolution to these apparently contradictory findings – da receptors may be differentially trafficked to different presynaptic varicosities in msn axons  <cit> . as d <dig> receptors mediate facilitatory effects while d2-like receptors mediate predominantly inhibitory effects, da could be either facilitatory or inhibitory – with varying potency – depending on the relative preponderance of functional d <dig> and d2-like receptors on individual varicosities.

da differentially modulates intrinsic synapses
the da agonists triggered strikingly divergent effects at different varicosities, including adjacent varicosities on the same axon, presumably reflecting heterogeneity in the relative abundance of functional da receptors on individual varicosities. in light of accumulating evidence that the distribution of many receptors is dynamically regulated by recruitment to postsynaptic sites, internalization and differential recycling  <cit> , it seems plausible that the distribution of da receptors on individual presynaptic varicosities might also vary considerably. in fact, this appears to be the case for msn projection axons. anatomical tracing studies have confirmed that all msns project to the pallidum, with about one third terminating there, and the remaining two thirds extending to the entopeduncular nucleus and the ventral midbrain  <cit> . physiological studies have shown that these projections are differentially modulated by da; projections to pallidal neurons are inhibited by d <dig> receptor activation  <cit> , while projections to the ventral midbrain are facilitated by d <dig> receptor activation  <cit> . these observations can be reconciled if d <dig> and d <dig> receptors are coexpressed in msn cell bodies but differentially trafficked in the axons of a given msn  <cit> .

several lines of evidence support the idea that da receptors undergo differential trafficking. alternatively spliced d <dig> receptor isoforms  are differentially targeted to different presynaptic terminals, where they mediate distinct functions  <cit> . consistent with this, we found in d3ko mice that the effect of quinpirole was heterogeneous, indicating that d <dig> receptors are heterogeneously distributed. alternatively, da receptors might be uniformly trafficked to all presynaptic terminals, but differentially distributed between surface  and intracellular  compartments. for example, d <dig> receptors are selectively sorted to degradation pathways, while d <dig> receptors are preferentially recycled back to the surface  <cit> . consequently, synapses expressing da receptors may have an altered expression profile depending on prior da exposure. this suggests that the differential distribution of da receptors observed at a given moment might reflect past patterns of da release.

microdomains in da receptor-mediated signaling
how could the observed da receptor-mediated modulation be so spatially restricted? voltage-dependent na+ or k+ channels are modulated directly by da  <cit> , which should control presynaptic ca2+ influx. but this is unlikely to account for the micro-heterogeneity we observed, since the varicosities recorded were often quite close together and were therefore probably isopotential. in contrast, camp which was in earlier studies thought to rapidly diffuse through the cytosol  <cit> , has been found in more recent studies, using sensitive biosensors, to be restricted in its diffusion to microdomains.  <cit> . molecules diffuse more slowly in the cytosol due to the molecular crowding effect  <cit> , which would be slowed further by the confinement effect of the narrow bore of axon. restricted signaling might be further ensured by the recruitment of active enzymes into close proximity of ca2+ channels through the interaction with scaffold proteins.  <cit> . for instance, in dendritic spines, ca2+ rises are modulated by g protein-coupled receptors through the activation of protein kinase a in a spatially restricted manner  <cit> . thus, the assembly of a multimeric signaling complex together with restricted diffusion of second messengers should enable local da modulation of nearby ca2+ channels.

synaptic vesicle release is triggered by clustered presynaptic ca2+ channels that produce discrete domains of elevated intracellular ca2+. among the members of the cav <dig> calcium channel family that mediate the presynaptic ca2+ rise, n-type and p/q-type channels are found on synapses interconnecting msns  <cit> , and are subject to da modulation  <cit> . due to cooperativity amongst clustered ca2+ channels, the channels may function as a single ca2+ entry site  <cit> . but because of the non-linear relationship between ca2+ influx and vesicle release, modest modulatory effects on individual ca2+ channels should translate into more dramatic changes in transmitter release, while at the same time restricting modulatory effects to subcellular microdomains  <cit> . thus, the da modulation of ca2+ responses we observed could control gaba release at individual msn varicosities and therefore play a role in encoding striatal information processing.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results raise the intriguing hypothesis that the differential distribution of da receptors reflects past patterns of da synaptic activity, and may thus be a novel site for enduring synaptic plasticity. intrinsic connections may be viewed as the hidden layer in a hopfield network  <cit>  – so their modulation would be expected to shape information flow through the area and confer greater computational capacity for motor and reward-related learning. the multiplicity of da receptor actions in combination with their differential distribution could produce large variations in da responsiveness at individual synapses. conceivably, aberrant patterns of da receptor activation could induce pathologic changes in the distribution of da receptors, giving rise to disorganized information flow, and ultimately to aberrant motor or appetitive behaviors.
