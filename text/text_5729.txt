BACKGROUND
quantitative trait locus  mapping approaches are popular genomic tools to dissect the genetic architecture underlying complex traits and to identify qtl 
 <cit> . the basis for these approaches are mapping populations, which are commonly phenotyped at only a single time point. it is well known, however, that many traits of agronomic importance are under the control of complex dynamic regulation 
 <cit> . consequently, the traditional static examination completely neglects the developmental dynamics underlying trait formation. for example, biomass changes with time and thus, two genotypes can be phenotypically identical at a certain developmental stage while the temporal patterns of genetic control may vary between them. until now, only little is known about the genetic dynamics of complex traits. yan et al. 
 <cit>  evaluated plant height in rice at different developmental stages and observed some qtl that could be detected at all stages whereas others were only detectable at one or some of them. busemeyer et al. 
 <cit>  recently reported a dynamic mapping for biomass in triticale and also observed developmental stage specific qtl.

in order to assess the temporal changes in the genetic control of trait formation, the phenome of the plants must be assessed at several time points. a key component for monitoring the phenotypic changes of plants is the development of appropriate phenotyping technologies which for crops must enable phenotyping under field conditions 
 <cit> . busemeyer et al. 
 <cit>  have recently described the development of the ‘breedvision’ precision phenotyping platform for non-invasive, high-throughput and high-dimensional phenotyping of small grain cereals under field conditions. this platform incorporates light curtains, laser distance sensors, a 3d-time-of-flight camera and hyperspectral imaging and traits are predicted based on sensor fusion, i.e., the combination of sensors and their information. this platform is of particular interest as it enables the evaluation of traits not amenable to traditional phenotyping and in addition, can replace destructive measurements thereby enabling multiple measurements of the same plants. biomass, for example, is traditionally evaluated by harvesting yield plots with a field chopper. the major disadvantage of this approach is, that it is destructive, thus prohibiting the assessment of other traits as well as the biomass development of the plots over time. the precision phenotyping platform has been calibrated for biomass yield of triticale which yielded a high prediction accuracy and heritability for the predicted biomass 
 <cit> .

triticale  shows a broad variation for biomass yield 
 <cit>  and is therefore well suited to study the genetics underlying this trait in small grain cereals. a powerful approach for qtl mapping is to employ multiple segregating families 
 <cit> . busemeyer et al. 
 <cit>  used biomass data from four families predicted based on measurements of the precision phenotyping platform at three developmental stages in combination with an association mapping approach to detect qtl. association mapping is an identity-by-state approach and the employed biometric model has been shown to be rather conservative 
 <cit> . consistenly, the analysis of part of these data with an identity-by-descent approach identified substantially more qtl 
 <cit> . the aim of this study was therefore to reanalyse the triticale biomass data 
 <cit>  employing an identity-by-descent approach to assess the temporal dynamics of qtl contributions to biomass yield. here, we describe the detection of main effect qtl for biomass yield in triticale at three different developmental stages, the variation in the contribution of these qtl to the genotypic variance over time, and the dynamics of epistatic qtl contributing to the genetic architecture underlying phenotypic development of biomass yield.

RESULTS
in the entire mapping population with  <dig> dh lines derived from four families, we observed significant  genotypic variances 
 and genotype-by-environment interaction variances 
 for biomass yield at all three developmental stages  . the ratio of 
 to 
 ranged from approximately 3: <dig> for bm <dig> to 7: <dig> for bm <dig>  the heritabilities were high and ranged from  <dig>  for bm <dig> to  <dig>  for bm <dig>  phenotypic correlations between biomass yield at the three developmental stages were  <dig>  for bm1-bm <dig>   <dig>  for bm2-bm <dig> and  <dig>  for bm1-bm <dig> . the phenotypic values of the parents differed to varying degrees ranging from Δ <dig>  to  <dig>  for bm <dig>  from Δ <dig>  to  <dig>  for bm <dig> and from Δ <dig>  to  <dig>  for bm <dig> . orthogonal contrasts of the means of the families and their respective parents were not significant except for family eaw <dig> for bm <dig> . the trait distributions approximately followed a normal distribution except for family eaw <dig> for which the distribution at bm <dig> and bm <dig> became bimodal. the variation within each family increased with increasing developmental stage  and in each family dh lines transgressed the respective parents for all three developmental stages. taken together, the data set captures the progression of biomass yield over time and is therefore well suited to study the underlying genetic dynamics.figure  <dig>

multiple-line cross qtl mapping revealed  <dig> qtl for bm <dig> and bm <dig> and  <dig> qtl for bm <dig> . interestingly, we observed biomass qtl that were detected at all three developmental stages as well as qtl that were only detected at one or two of the developmental stages . combined, the qtl explained between  <dig>   and  <dig>   percent of the genotypic variance. the proportion of genotypic variance explained by single qtl ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for bm <dig>  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for bm <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  percent for bm <dig> . the major qtl detected at all three developmental stages was located on chromosome 5r. another qtl which consistently contributed more than  <dig> percent to the genotypic variance was identified on chromosome 5a and on chromosome 6a a qtl contributing a similar proportion to bm <dig> and bm <dig> was found. we used fivefold cross-validation to assess the quality of the obtained qtl results . this revealed a bias in the estimation of the proportion of genotypic variance which cross-validated still ranged between  <dig>   and  <dig>   percent. the qtl frequency distributions revealed some qtl that were detected in a high number of runs whereas other qtl identified with the full data set were only detected in few runs . by contrast, few qtl were detected in a considerable number of runs which have not been identified in the full data set .we next assessed the contribution to the genotypic variance at bm <dig>  bm <dig> and bm <dig> for all loci detected as qtl for any of the three developmental stages. this substantiated the presence of chromosomal regions which stably contribute to biomass yield as opposed to regions which only contribute to biomass yield in a temporally restricted manner .the full 2-dimensional epistasis scan revealed epistatic qtl for all three developmental stages . eight epistatic qtl were identified for bm <dig>  three for bm <dig> and four for bm <dig>  the contribution of these epistatic qtl to the genotypic variance was small and ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  percent. the epistatic interaction landscape undergoes temporal changes with development as illustrated in figure

discussion
many traits of biological or agronomic importance undergo dynamic changes with time and the developmental progression of the individuals. it therefore appears obvious that these changes will at least in part be reflected by similar changes in the underlying genetics. however, a temporal assessment of the genetic architecture of complex traits has thus far largely been neglected. in this study we therefore performed a dynamic mapping of biomass yield qtl in triticale to decipher the genetic dynamics underlying phenotypic development of this trait.

phenotypic development of biomass yield
a prerequiste for efficient qtl detection in multiple families is the precise estimation of phenotypic values 
 <cit> . in addition, for traits which are traditionally assessed by destructive measurements, alternative non-invasive approaches are required to enable monitoring dynamic changes of the trait over time. in this study we focused on biomass yield as the accumulation of biomass is central to agricultural productivity, employing triticale as model crop for small grain cereals. the earliest developmental stage  was chosen at bbch stage  <dig> as this represents the earliest time point when triticale would be harvested for biomass. biomass was predicted based on sensor measurements of the precision phenotyping platform and we observed high heritabilities for all three developmental stages at which biomass yield was assessed. this in combination with the high prediction accuracies underlines the great potential of precision phenotyping, especially for a temporal assessment of dynamic traits.

biomass yield was characterized by a progression with time and the development of the plants . the correlations of biomass yield at the different time points were highest for the directly successive time points  and decreased with increasing temporal and thus developmental distance between time points . the variation in phenotypic values increased with development of the plants . this does not appear to be caused by an increased influence of the environment as the contribution of the genotype-by-environment interaction variance was strongest at bm <dig>  rather, the effects of the genetic factors contributing to biomass yield become more pronounced the longer they act on the trait. this is exemplified by the development of biomass in family eaw <dig>  gowda et al. 
 <cit>  have recently shown that grain yield, heading time, spikes per square meter, 1000-kernel weight, and early plant height are key contributors to early biomass yield. family eaw <dig> segregates for a major plant height qtl which likely corresponds to the rye dwarfing gene ddw <dig> and which causes the observed bimodal distribution 
 <cit> . however, the distribution of the biomass yield values in family eaw <dig> shows a strong temporal plasticity. at bm <dig> the biomass values are normally distributed, then turn into the bimodel distribution at bm <dig> which at bm <dig> becomes less pronounced. thus, ddw <dig> appears to have the strongest contribution to biomass yield at bm <dig> after which its influence on biomass declines or that of other factors becomes more prominent. this illustrates the plasticity of the trait and the temporal contribution of genetic factors to its expression and highlights the need for a temporal assessment of the underlying genetics.

detection of biomass yield qtl
busemeyer et al. 
 <cit>  used an association mapping approach to analyze the data but identified only the major qtl on chromosomes 5a and 5r. by contrast, the linkage mapping approach applied here appears more powerful with regard to qtl detection in this data set as we identified nine or ten qtl for biomass yield at all three developmental stages. these qtl were supported by the qtl frequency distributions . consequently, the proportion of genotypic variance  explained by the qtl detected here was approximately twice as high as that described in the previous study. for all three developmental stages the pg was around  <dig> percent and even cross-validated still amounted to a considerable  <dig> to  <dig> percent . this is in accordance with the quantitative nature of the trait which implies many qtl with effects too small to be detected in qtl mapping given a reasonable population size.

contribution of epistasis to biomass yield
epistasis refers to interactions between the alleles at two or more genetic loci 
 <cit> . it contributes to the genetic architecture of many complex traits and has recently been reported for different crops including maize, wheat and rapeseed 
. the orthogonal contrasts between family means and the means of the respective parents were only significant for bm <dig> in family eaw <dig> which indicates the presence of epistasis. it must be noted however, that non-significant orthogonal contrasts do not imply abscence of epistasis. our analysis revealed epistatic qtl for all three developmental stages . the detection power for epistatic qtl, however, more strongly depends on the population size than that for the detection of main effect qtl. thus, despite the relatively large mapping population employed here, many epistatic qtl may have remained undetected due to insufficient qtl detection power. in contrast to the main effect qtl for which similar numbers were detected for each developmental stage, we identified substantially more epistatic qtl for bm <dig> as compared to bm <dig> and bm <dig>  this corroborates previous findings from busemeyer et al. 
 <cit>  and suggests a varying contribution of epistasis to the genetic architecture of biomass yield over time. the proportion of genotypic variance explained by these epistatic qtl was rather small and averaged  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  percent for bm <dig>  bm <dig> and bm <dig>  respectively. nevertheless, this result illustrates the contribution of epistasis to the genetic architecture of biomass yield, especially assuming that a number of epistatic qtl had remained undetected.

temporal genetic patterns of biomass regulation
the nature of dynamic traits with their temporal changes suggests at least some plasticity in the underlying genetic control. we observed an almost equal number of qtl for biomass yield for each of the three developmental stages but the venn diagram indicated both specific and overlapping qtl . the detection of a qtl at all three time points indicates that it stably contributes to biomass yield throughout the studied development, ranging from the stage where the awns are just visible to very early dough development. by contrast, some qtl were only detected at one or two of these developmental stages. two qtl were identified at two developmental stages which in both cases were successive stages, i.e., bm <dig> and bm <dig> or bm <dig> and bm <dig>  for each developmental stage we identified four or five qtl that were only detected for that particular stage. as illustrated by the lod profiles  this does not appear to be caused by peaks close to the significance threshold, being by chance slightly above or below it for the different time points. by contrast, it appears to reflect the dynamic genetics underlying biomass accumulation in triticale. this is supported by the variable contribution of the loci detected for any of the three developmental stages to the genotypic variance at bm <dig>  bm <dig> and bm <dig>  respectively . interestingly, we observed a similar plasticity for the epistatic interactions suggesting that the entire genetic architecture of biomass yield undergoes dynamic changes during the developmental progression of the plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we employed phenomics data of biomass yield generated at three developmental stages by precision phenotyping of a large mapping population of triticale. we show the phenotypic plasticity of this trait and demonstrate that this is reflected in a similar plasticity of the underlying genetics. thus, the genetics of dynamic traits should best be assessed in a temporal manner to capture all the genetic factors that contribute to the trait during development.
