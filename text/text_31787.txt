BACKGROUND
bacteria in the genus streptomyces are a prolific source of natural products, many of which are used in the clinic as antibiotic, anticancer, immune-modulatory or other therapeutic agents. furthermore these soil bacteria have an unusual life style; vegetative growth is mycelial and when nutrients become scarce a sporulation cycle initiates  <cit> . the phages that infect these bacteria have been exploited in the development of vectors for genetic engineering of streptomyces and closely related genera, in particular in the study of natural product pathways  <cit> .

the development of integrating vectors that integrate via site-specific recombination between a site on the plasmid vector, the attp site and a site in the bacterial chromosome, the attb site have been widely adopted by researchers wishing to genetically manipulate streptomyces genes  <cit> . the int/attp site from the integrating plasmid, psam <dig>  was first exploited in a novel vector that could integrate into the endogenous attb site in the streptomyces genome  <cit> . the advantage of the integration vectors over freely replicating plasmid vectors are the very low copy number , the ease of construction of plasmids, which can be done in e. coli, and the simple method of plasmid transfer into streptomyces via conjugation  <cit> .

the idea of using phage integrases by the research group at eli lilley, led to the development of integrating vectors encoding the int/attp locus from the streptomyces phage ϕc <dig>  <cit> . the recombination event that leads to phage integration is a conservative reciprocal dna cleavage and rejoining mechanism occurring at the centre of the attp and attb sites producing the integrated plasmid flanked by hybrid attp/b sites called attl and attr <cit> . phage integrases are known to be highly directional, with tight control over integration versus excision. integration  is the default reaction for phage integrases whilst excision  requires activation by a recombination directionality factor  or xis  <cit> . consequently the integration vectors based on the ϕc <dig> int/attp system and lacking any other phage genes are 100% stable in most streptomyces species. the ϕc <dig> integrating vectors integrated with higher efficiency and were more stable than the psam2-derived integration vectors and are now widely adopted by researchers in streptomyces genetics. the use of the ϕc <dig> integration system is also being widely adopted for genome engineering in eukaryotes, in particular in tissue culture and model organisms such as the mouse and drosophila <cit> .

in  <dig> the int/attp locus from the phage ϕbt <dig> was used to generate an alternative suite of phage-derived integration vectors for streptomyces <cit> . these vectors were demonstrated to be completely orthogonal to the ϕc <dig> derived plasmids and plasmids derived from the two phage int/attp loci could be used in combination without loss of integrating efficiency. the ϕbt <dig> int/attp integration vectors are also widely used in the streptomyces community. recently vectors based on phage tg <dig> have been developed for use in streptomyces avermitilis <cit> .

here we present a new integrating vector derived from s. venezuelae phage sv <dig>  <cit> . we demonstrate the efficient integration of the plasmid into several streptomyces spp. although, surprisingly, we failed to obtain stable integrants in s. venezuelae.

RESULTS
the genome of phage sv <dig> was sequenced previously and, consistent with the temperate nature of the phage, g <dig> encodes an integrase  <cit> . gp <dig> is a serine integrase, whose closest homologue in the database is from streptomyces prunicolor . sv <dig> is only distantly related  to ϕc <dig>  tg <dig> and ϕbt <dig> integrases so the sv <dig> integration system encoded by sv <dig> g27/attp is therefore very likely to be another orthologous system to ϕc <dig> and ϕbt <dig> integration systems.

the dna upstream and downstream of sv <dig> g <dig> was studied for a likely attp site. precedent dictates that attp is normally upstream or downstream of the integrase gene but in some mobile genetic elements, such as sccmec, can be located quite distal from their cognate integrase genes  <cit> . in sv <dig> the attp site is unlikely to be upstream of g <dig> as the upstream gene, g <dig>  overlaps with g <dig> by the sequence 5′atga, which couples the start codon  of g <dig> with the stop codon of g <dig> . downstream of g <dig> is a non-coding region of 342 bp before the start of the downstream gene, g <dig>  the attp sites for the serine integrases commonly comprise a perfect inverted repeat flanking a spacer of at least 20 bp  <cit> . within the g26-g <dig> intergenic region in sv <dig> there are two perfect inverted repeats ; the ir distal to g <dig> has a spacer of 5 bp and the ir proximal to g <dig> has a 22 bp spacer. moreover the ir proximal to g <dig> has a 10 bp perfect inverted repeat so, together with the spacer dna, the length of this dna element is 42 bp which is the same length as the ϕc <dig> attp site. the length attp sites used by other serine integrases is between  <dig> and 69 bp  <cit> . the attp site in sv <dig> is therefore likely to be located between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> and is downstream of the integrase gene, g <dig> 

as the sv <dig> g <dig> is likely to be expressed as part of an operon, we decided to test its integrating properties by swapping the ϕc <dig> int orf expressed from the tcp <dig> promoter in pey <dig> for the sv <dig> g27/attp locus . primers were designed to clone the sv <dig> g27/attp locus  <dig> to  <dig> comprising the putative attp site and the g <dig> orf in both orientations downstream of the tcp <dig> promoter in pey <dig>  to generate pms <dig> and pbf <dig> . both plasmids were introduced into e. coli et <dig>  and used in conjugation reactions with s. coelicolor j <dig>  surprisingly the numbers of exconjugants were not significantly different for pbf <dig>  and pms <dig>  and this occurred with or without addition of anhydrotetracycline . in fact exconjugants containing pbf <dig> tended to overproduce the two pigments actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin indicating a possible stress response, perhaps due to overexpression of sv <dig> integrase. we assume that there are fortuitous sequences upstream of the g <dig> gene in pms <dig> that resemble both promoter and ribosome binding sites for integrase expression after conjugation to streptomyces. the low frequency of exconjugants from e. coli containing pey <dig> in this experiment is likely to be due to the absence of the ϕc <dig> attp site .

to validate the integration of the plasmids via sv <dig> g27/attp site into the s. coelicolor genome, we have identified the integration site of sv <dig> phage using an inverse pcr technique. genomic dna from an exconjugant of s. coelicolor j <dig> containing the integrated pms <dig> was cut with a restriction enzyme for which there is no recognition site within pms <dig> and self-ligated. primers reading outwards from the sv <dig> plasmid into the s. coelicolor j <dig> genome were then used to generate a pcr product . the plasmid pms <dig> was found to have integrated into sco <dig> encoding a putative 4-coumarate-coa ligase, a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway that, at least in plants, is important in secondary metabolism pathways for flavonoids and monolignols  <cit> . based on the dna sequence of this pcr product, we constructed two further primers against the integration region  to amplify attb, attr, and attl  . the resulting dna sequences confirmed that the sv <dig> attb site is within sco <dig> and the attp site is located, as predicted, downstream of the sv <dig> g <dig> gene . the attp and the attb have similar features to those observed in the other serine integrase attachment sites; they both contain inverted repeats but these are different in the attb and attp sequences, and there is an identical sequence of 4 bp in the centre of both substrates where the recombination occurs   <cit> 

plasmid pms <dig> was modified to remove unnecessary dna, the attr site from ϕc <dig>  and the tcp <dig> promoter to generate pbf <dig> . this novel integration vector has unique xhoi, xbai, kpni and pvuii sites for cloning. to test whether pbf <dig> could integrate into a range of streptomyces genomes it was introduced by conjugation into s. coelicolor, s. lividans, s. venezuelae, s. avermitilis and s. albus. conjugation frequencies of pbf <dig> into s. coelicolor and s. lividans were reminiscent of those obtained with ϕbt <dig> and ϕc <dig> integration plasmids; the numbers of hygromycin resistant exconjugants for s. coelicolor j <dig>  s. coelicolor m <dig>  and s. lividans tk <dig> were greater than 1 ×  <dig> , and the integrations were stable after two rounds of sporulation without selection . when s. venezuelae was used as the recipient, the hygromycin resistant exconjugants were, although numerous, very small and the integrations were not stable as after two rounds of sporulation, hygromycin resistance was lost. a blast search using the sv <dig> attb site from s. coelicolor revealed that highly similar sequences were indeed present in s. lividans and s. avermilitis but no homologous sequences were found in s. albus or s. venezuelae. despite the presence of a putative attb site for sv <dig> in s. avermitilis the frequency of conjugation and integration of pbf <dig> was very low .

the sequences of the sv <dig> attb and attp sites are distinct from the recombination sites for the other known phage integrases. we showed previously that integrating vectors derived using integrases from ϕc <dig> and ϕbt <dig> do not interfere with each other with respect to the frequency of integration or their stability  <cit> . we therefore tested whether the integration frequencies of ϕc <dig> or ϕbt <dig> derived integrating vectors were affected if the recipient already contained pbf <dig> integrated at the sv <dig> attb site. conjugations were performed using e. coli donors containing either pset <dig>  or prt <dig> , both plasmids conferring apramycin resistance, and s. coelicolor m <dig> containing pbf <dig> as recipient. selection was for both hygromycin and apramycin. there was no great reduction in the conjugation frequency compared with the use of plasmid-free s. coelicolor m <dig> as a recipient . sv <dig> vectors can therefore be used in combination without interference with ϕc <dig> and ϕbt <dig> derived vectors.

hygromycin resistant colonies obtained after conjugation of e. coli containing pbf <dig> with s. coelicolor j <dig>  s. coelicolor m <dig>  s. lividans tk <dig> and s. venezuelae were allowed to sporulate and were subcultured twice on medium without selection. genomic dna was isolated and analysed by southern blotting . the expected  <dig>  kbp band, indicative of integrated pbf <dig>  was observed in the dna from s. coelicolor and s. lividans exconjugants. the absence of the  <dig>  kbp band from the s. venezuelae genomic dna indicated that pbf <dig> did not persist in this strain and was lost. stable hygromycin resistant s. venezuelae exconjugants were obtained with the ϕbt <dig> and ϕc <dig> derived vectors . paradoxically a lysogen of sv <dig> in s. venezuelae is perfectly stable and grows like the non-lysogen. we deduce that the interruption in sco <dig> caused by the integrating plasmid is toxic, but the toxicity is ameliorated by a prophage-encoded gene or by an unknown cis effect within the integrated prophage. notably sv <dig> does not encode a homologue to sco <dig>  or fragments of sco <dig> that could compensate for its truncation by integration of sv <dig> derived integrating vectors.

CONCLUSIONS
the activity of a novel phage integration system from bacteriophage sv <dig> has been demonstrated in s. coelicolor and s. lividans and the attp and attb sites identified. we believe that the new integrating vector pbf <dig> will be of use in the genetic manipulation of these and other streptomyces strains. more generally the characterization of a new integrase and its substrates will provide biologists with new tools for dna assembly in the genomes of a wide range of microorganisms and other model organisms.
