BACKGROUND
scrapie in sheep is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy  present in most sheep-producing countries  <cit> . infection with  scrapie is thought to occur at young age, after which it takes an incubation period of one or more years before clinical signs, such as uncoordinated movement, abnormal postures and severe scratching, become apparent. during this incubation period the infectious prion protein prpsc accumulates in the animal  <cit> . scrapie control has become a priority in many countries mainly because experimental infection of sheep with bovine spongiform encephalopathy  has shown that sheep can be infected via the oral route and that the resulting clinical symptoms are very similar to scrapie  <cit> . fears that bse may have been introduced into sheep through consumption of feed supplements in the past, with potential consequences to public health  <cit> , have eased somewhat recently since tests of millions of sheep have not produced a single sample positive for bse, neither in the healthy-slaughter nor in the fallen-stock testing stream.

the susceptibility to scrapie is modulated by polymorphisms of the sheep prion protein  gene. in this paper we focus on classical scrapie, for which the most important polymorphisms occur at the codons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  five alleles  are observed in this study. the vrq allele is known to confer high susceptibility to classical scrapie, the arq and arh alleles are associated with moderate susceptibility and the ahq allele with low susceptibility. the arr allele confers resistance, with the homozygous genotype arr/arr being extremely resistant  <cit> . these properties make the use of exclusively arr/arr rams for breeding  a means to reduce the number of susceptible animals in a sheep population.

in the european union  the regulation eu 2001/ <dig> prescribes the genetic testing, and the selection of rams intended for breeding in scrapie-free flocks of "high genetic merit" . several years before this eu regulation came into force, some member states already had a national breeding programme in place, including the netherlands , great britain   <cit> , and france . in the netherlands, the breeding programme consisted of arr/arr ram selection, and initially sheep breeders could join it on a voluntary basis. this programme was made compulsory for the whole dutch sheep industry in november  <dig>  thereby becoming the most ambitious programme worldwide.

another important activity for the control of scrapie is the large active surveillance programme of testing healthy slaughtered sheep and fallen stock for scrapie by a rapid test on brainstem samples. this programme concerns animals over  <dig> months of age and was introduced in the eu in  <dig>  <cit> . the number of animals to be tested is prescribed yearly by the eu and is a percentage of the total size of the member states' slaughtered sheep and fallen stock. in the netherlands in the period 2002- <dig> this percentage ranged between  <dig> and 25% for healthy slaughtered sheep and  <dig> % and 11% for fallen stock. since  <dig>  the eu regulation eu 2001/ <dig> governs the control measures in flocks of origin of classical-scrapie positive animals in the active or passive surveillance. these measures consist of either a whole-flock cull or genotyping all animals and culling the animals of susceptible genotype and examining the brain stem of all or a sample of the culled animals of at least  <dig> months of age for scrapie positivity, using rapid tests.

the dutch sheep population consists of a breeding sector with three large pure breeds , more than  <dig> smaller breeds, and a production sector dominated by texel and swifter sheep. the production sector makes up more than 90% of the dutch sheep population. the dutch agricultural census counted  <dig>  farms with sheep in the netherlands in  <dig>   <dig> of which had less than  <dig> sheep . however, as only farms with certain minimum economic value of their overall agricultural activities are included in the census, the total number of farms with sheep, including those that keep sheep for recreational purposes, is much higher  <cit> .

in table  <dig> we give a chronological overview of the scrapie control measures in the netherlands since the disease became notifiable in  <dig>  ram selection was obligatory between october  <dig> and september  <dig> for all sheep farmers with more than  <dig> breeding ewes , and between september  <dig> and june  <dig> for all sheep farmers . in june  <dig> the legal obligation was lifted. this compulsory ram selection programme had been preceded by a voluntary program for sheep breeders that started in  <dig>  in addition to the scrapie control measures listed in table  <dig>  the bse-related eu ban on use of mbm and most other animal protein in feed of farm animals, imposed in  <dig>  <cit>  could potentially have impacted on scrapie trends: if sheep feed cross-contaminated with scrapie would have been a significant scrapie transmission route before  <dig>  <cit> , one would expect the ban to lead to a significant reduction in scrapie prevalence becoming noticeable around  <dig> .

chronology of scrapie control measures in the netherlands.

the three main aims of this paper are to identify trends in scrapie prevalence in slaughtered and fallen sheep in the netherlands, to identify trends in the frequencies of different genotypes in the dutch sheep population, and to determine the relative risk of different prp genotypes to become a detected scrapie case.

methods
data and analyses
the analysis of the abovementioned trends and risks are carried out based on recently gathered data on both scrapie infection of and genotype frequencies in the dutch sheep population. these data consist of two parts: surveillance data and culled-flocks data. the surveillance data consist of the scrapie test results accumulated within the dutch active surveillance on tses in sheep , and of a yearly random genotyping sample from this active surveillance , both from the healthy-slaughter and the fallen-stock samples. details on the sampling strategy, genotyping technique and rapid test used are given below. the culled-flocks data  consist of scrapie genotyping results and scrapie infection test results in animals that were culled, as part of the mandatory scrapie control efforts, on flocks of origin of scrapie index cases. for details on genotyping and testing see below. immunohistochemistry  was used for confirmation of the positive cases detected using the rapid test. ihc and western blotting were used to discriminate between classical and atypical scrapie.

the surveillance data allow us to study any temporal trend in the detected scrapie cases in the dutch sheep population and at the same time provide a sample from the genotype frequencies at a national level. the combination allows us to study any related trends in case numbers and frequencies of susceptible versus resistant genotypes. clearly, we expect to see an increase in the frequency of resistant genotypes, and as a result of that, after some delay, a reduction in scrapie case numbers.

when assessing prevalence trends, we are interested in particular to see if not only the overall prevalence but also the prevalence calculated per head of susceptible genotype is declining as a result of the breeding programme. this is because we seek to determine if the breeding programme causes a population effect. the expected population effect is derived using a simple mathematical model in the additional material .

apart from the ram selection, also the culling of scrapie flocks will impact on the scrapie transmission potential, measured by the basic reproduction number r <dig>  in two ways. firstly, in comparison to a situation without culling, the culling of flocks of origin of scrapie cases will reduce the mean duration of flock-level scrapie outbreaks, and thereby reduce the length of the period that infected flocks pose an infection risk to other  flocks. for a mathematical model of this latter effect we refer the reader to the additional material . a second way in which the culling of affected flocks impacts on the transmission potential is by reducing the frequency of susceptible genotypes in the population  <cit> , thus aiding the ram selection program in increasing the genetic resistance level.

the culled-flocks data allow us to calculate the detected infection prevalence in different genotypes, and thereby obtain information on the relative risk of infection across different genotypes.

genotyping
prp genotypes were determined  by a routine taqman test that is completely automated. it can detect polymorphisms  <dig> a to v,  <dig> r to h, and  <dig> q to r. from  <dig>  or  <dig>  onwards our taqman genotyping additionally distinguishes between q and h at codon  <dig>  when analyzing the culled-flocks data we consider total numbers of animals for each genotype across the period 2003- <dig> and we therefore group the 2006- <dig> arq and arh results together, using the notation arq*. the taqman principle is a test in which a small part of the prp gene is amplified. during amplification dedicated fluorescent probes are used to detect absence/presence of specific polymorphisms. a second test, based on pyrosequencing, was used as a confirmatory test on randomly selected samples.

sampling and testing in the active surveillance
throughout the period of 2002- <dig> the sampling strategy in the dutch surveillance programme at each of the slaughterhouses  consisted of randomly selecting one animal per n slaughtered sheep, with a minimum of one sheep on a slaughter day per slaughterhouse. here n was chosen such that the expected total number of animals sampled in the netherlands on a 12-months basis would match eu requirements. due to changes in the eu target number of animals tested per  <dig> months , n changed between periods, with n ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> 

the sampling of fallen stock at the rendering plant  also followed a random strategy throughout the period of study. during the period 2002- <dig>  the sampling strategy was designed to randomly sample sufficient fallen sheep to fulfill the eu requirements of testing a specified minimum number of fallen sheep per  <dig> months. most often the minimum number was  <dig>  animals per  <dig> months, and this target could be achieved by randomly sampling at most  <dig> sheep per working day at the rendering plant. in other periods the sampling strategy was randomly adjusted to the changes in the eu target number of fallen sheep tested per  <dig> months . the rapid tests used for both the active surveillance and culled flocks were the prionics check western  and the prionics check western sr from june  <dig> onwards. for classical scrapie these tests have the same diagnostic and analytical sensitivity in our hands. as a result, we do not expect any temporal bias in the data from the dutch surveillance programme in the period of study.

sampling from the active surveillance
from the brain homogenates from healthy slaughter arriving for testing at the central veterinary institute, approximately  <dig> out of  <dig>  or  <dig>  or  <dig>  was randomly selected for genotyping. from the brain homogenates from fallen stock approximately  <dig> out of  <dig>  or  <dig>  was randomly selected for genotyping. in table  <dig> we give the total numbers of samples taken from healthy slaughtered sheep and from fallen stock, together with the size of the random sample for genotyping. due to the random sampling at the slaughterhouse and at the rendering plant, we expect each yearly random sample to be representative for the allele and genotype frequencies in animals over  <dig> months of age in that year in healthy slaughtered sheep and in fallen stock, respectively.

relative scrapie risks
we will use the genotype arq*/vrq, being the most frequent genotype amongst dutch scrapie cases, as the reference for defining genotype-specific relative risks. the mathematical definition and statistical estimation of genotype-specific relative scrapie risks are as follows. if the scrapie risk of arq*/vrq animals is given by a  probability parq*/vrq of being found positive, we write the corresponding probability of genotype γ as pγ = rγ parq*/vrq, where rγ is the relative risk of genotype γ. the parameters rγ are estimated using maximum-likelihood based on binomial probabilities pγ and confidence bounds are based on the likelihood ratio test.

RESULTS
trends in genotype frequencies
figures  <dig> and  <dig> display the trends in frequencies of the alleles and genotypes, respectively, in the yearly genotyping sample from the active surveillance . in figure  <dig> we observe that the frequency of the arr allele has increased from less than 40% in  <dig> to more than 50% in  <dig>  which is a significant increase . the observed decline in  <dig> in comparison to  <dig> is not significant . we therefore conclude that ram selection has produced a significant rise in the frequency of the arr allele in the dutch sheep population. we also observe a reduction in the presence of the arq allele. no significant trends are observed for the arh, ahq and vrq alleles. in terms of genotypes  the trend towards more scrapie resistance is best visible in the genotypes arr/arr, arr/ahq and arr/arq  and arh/arh, arq/arq and vrq/arq . for the less frequent genotypes the patterns in figure  <dig> are dominated by chance fluctuations. the total frequency of animals without arr allele calculated from the  <dig> sample is  <dig> %, and in  <dig> this number is  <dig> %. the overall downward trend suggests an average yearly reduction of this frequency with  <dig> %.

is the decline in scrapie prevalence as found in figure  <dig> simply a direct result of the reduction  in the frequency of susceptible genotypes, or has the programme also led to a population effect? to answer this question, we need to inspect the prevalence per tested animal of susceptible genotype. in figure  <dig> we do this for the years 2005- <dig>  focusing on the genotype arq*/vrq, the most prominent genotype amongst scrapie positive animals . here we have used a result from the additional material  to estimate the prevalence in arq*/vrq animals tested in each year from the overall prevalence in tested animals, the proportion of positive animals having arq*/vrq genotype, and the proportion of animals having arq*/vrq genotype within the sample from the active surveillance of that year. the likelihood-ratio test shows that there is a significant  downward trend in prevalence from  <dig> to  <dig> . as the sampling strategy remained the same throughout this period, and the test sensitivity is believed to have remained the same as well, we conclude from the observed decline that a reduction in the scrapie infection risks to animals of susceptible genotype has occurred. we interpret this reduction as being a population effect caused mainly by the increase in the number of animals of resistant genotype . as we argue in the conclusions, the effect on transmission of the reduction of the infectious period of affected farms  is expected to be less important.

flock culls
in table  <dig> and  <dig> we give summary information on the scrapie flock culls in 2002- <dig>  in this period, in total  <dig> flock culls were carried out, the yearly number peaking at  <dig> flock culls in  <dig>  two flock culls were related to an atypical scrapie index case, and these produced no secondary cases. of all animals present in the flocks at the time of the flock cull, close to 36% was culled, and of these culled animals approximately 66% was tested, producing  <dig> secondary cases of classical scrapie. we note that the number of animals actually infected at the time of culling is expected to be higher than that, as infected animals will be tested positive only when they are at a sufficiently advanced stage of incubation  <cit> . mathematical modelling would be needed to derive infection prevalence estimates from detectable prevalence; for examples of such modelling applied to clinical case surveillance data in great britain, see  <cit> .

genotype profiles of scrapie-affected flocks
in tables  <dig> and  <dig> we list the genotype and allele frequencies across culled flocks with classical scrapie in the period 2002- <dig>  before making a comparison between these frequencies and those across the whole dutch population as found in the yearly genotyping sample from the active surveillance in the period 2005- <dig>  we note that the result of such a comparison should be interpreted with care. this is because the frequencies in the culled flocks data represent the genetic variation across animals present in the flock , whereas the yearly genotyping samples from the active surveillance represents the genetic variation in slaughtered animals and fallen stock . in the presence of an ongoing arr/arr ram selection policy, younger animals are expected to have a higher arr frequency than older animals, and therefore the expected higher age of the animals tested in the active surveillance will tend to produce a lower observed arr allele frequency than if animals were sampled as in the culled-flocks data. we find that, at least at the moment of culling, the mean allele and genotype frequencies in the culled scrapie flocks are very similar to what is observed in the active surveillance. for example, the mean arr frequency across flocks culled in the period 2005- <dig> is  <dig> %, and compares to a range  spanned by the yearly genotyping samples from the active surveillance. similarly, the mean arq* frequency across flocks culled in the period 2005- <dig> is  <dig> %, comparing to a range  spanned by the yearly genotyping samples from the active surveillance.

in table  <dig> we compare our results with relative risks of clinical scrapie in british sheep calculated from risk estimates by baylis et al.  <cit>  from british passive scrapie surveillance data from the period 1998- <dig>  the same surveillance data have been analyzed by tongue et al.  <cit> , but with different genotyping dataset as denominator data. these authors analyzed the risks of clinical scrapie relative to the genotype arq/arq by estimating odds ratios for the different genotypes. the  estimates they obtain, when recalculated relative to arq/vrq, are broadly similar to the relative risks we have calculated here from the estimates by baylis et al. one striking difference between the two sets of relative risks in table  <dig> is observed for the arr/vrq genotype: for this genotype the relative infection risk estimated here from the dutch culled-flocks data is higher than the risk of death from scrapie as estimated by baylis et al. one possible hypothesis would be that the difference arises due to breed  <cit>  and/or scrapie strain differences between the countries. another possible hypothesis would be that the difference arises because arr/vrq animals affected by scrapie are less likely to show overt clinical symptoms, and thus to be detected by the british passive surveillance system , than animals of other susceptible genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we have analyzed scrapie prevalence data obtained from both surveillance and control, together with yearly genotyping sample from the active surveillance. although these analyses are specific to the netherlands, the results seem relevant and encouraging for all other countries interested in scrapie control.

the main results are as follows. scrapie prevalence in the netherlands is showing a downward trend in the last four years. allele and genotype distributions in the dutch sheep population are showing a clear trend of increasing genetic resistance to scrapie, showing that compliance to the ram selection programme has been substantial. estimated prevalence levels per head of susceptible genotype are declining significantly, consistently with an anticipated population effect of the breeding programme. finally, we observe that the relative risk found here for arr/vrq animals is much larger than their relative scrapie risk under past passive surveillance in great britain.

the observed reduction in scrapie prevalence is likely to be due to two causes: the increasing genetic resistance of the population and culling of scrapie flocks. how much may be attributed to the increase in scrapie resistance, and how much to the shortening of flock-level outbreaks due to the culling of affected flocks? an order-of-magnitude estimation using modelling arguments and using data for  <dig> suggests that the contribution of affected-flock culling to the reduction of scrapie prevalence in the netherlands is small compared to that of selective breeding. for details we refer the reader to the additional material .

as reported elsewhere  <cit> , a comparison of the genotyping samples from the active surveillance to an independent genotyping sample, taken on  <dig> sheep farms, shows a good correspondence. more precisely, in  <cit>  it is found that the temporal trend in genotype frequencies in the yearly genotyping sample from the active surveillance conforms well to the trend visible in the sample taken on the farms when consecutively removing recent birth cohorts. this result provides further confidence for the assumption that the yearly genotyping sample from the active surveillance streams provides a representative picture of the genotype distribution in the dutch sheep population. comparing the overall genotype frequencies estimated above from the surveillance data and from the genotype profiles across the culled flocks, we can investigate to which extent these latter flocks have more susceptible profiles as compared to the national average. we observe that frequencies of susceptible genotypes do not seem to be much above average on farms with scrapie outbreaks, which may seem paradoxical. however, in the presence of arr ram selection, current between-flock differences in genotype and allele frequencies might not be representative for the differences at the time that the actual scrapie infections took place. also, the incomplete tracing of flocks of origin of scrapie cases found in the active surveillance might introduce a bias in the culled flocks data towards more professionally organized sheep farmers, that might be more likely to comply with ram selection. due to the absence of age information in the culled flocks data it requires genetic model extrapolations to correct for these ram selection effects; such analyses will be reported elsewhere.

the relative scrapie risks of different genotypes in positive flocks provide useful clues to the relative susceptibility of these genotypes. the relative susceptibility is of particular interest as a parameter for mathematical models of within-flock scrapie transmission  <cit> . we note that relative prevalence and relative susceptibility cannot be simply equated to each other for two main reasons. the first is that differences in the rate of disease progress between genotypes  are expected to lead to genotype-dependent probabilities of detecting infection in a scrapie test at a given age. this issue is complicated further by genotype-dependent differences in sensitivities of different rapid tests that have been approved for use in the eu screening program  <cit> . the second is that infection prevalence will only be proportional to susceptibility away from infection saturation levels, i.e. when prevalence is low.
