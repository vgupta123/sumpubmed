BACKGROUND
addressing global concerns regarding crop yield and fossil fuel energy will require novel strategies. photosynthesis harnesses solar energy, produces carbohydrates and biomaterials and sustains the carbon/oxygen cycle; supercharging photosynthesis may help to address these concerns and meet increasing demands for food, fuel, and biomaterials  <cit> . improving photosynthesis in annual, herbaceous crops would provide substantial benefits, as more than 90% of crop biomass derives from photosynthetic products  <cit> . the woody tissues of trees make up roughly 20% of the total terrestrial carbon storage  <cit> , and also derive from photosynthetic products. therefore, improving photosynthesis in perennial, woody crops would improve carbon fixation, biomaterials production, and biofuels efficiency.

despite its importance, photosynthesis has inefficiencies: plants typically convert only 2% to 4% of the available solar energy into plant growth  <cit> . the gap between the real and potential photosynthetic rate under field conditions suggests that photosynthesis could be improved to increase crop yields and improve the economics of biofuel production. however, the complex process of photosynthesis includes many potential target reactions, such as light harvesting, carbon fixation, photophosphorylation and electron transport  <cit> . potential ways to improve photosynthesis include directly improving the mechanism of photosynthesis itself  <cit> , or exploring and analyzing the complexity of photosynthetic regulation in the field to improve photosynthesis from a whole-plant perspective. studies exploring improvements to the mechanism of photosynthesis have been widely reported  <cit> . current proposals to improve photosynthesis mainly include improving the performance of rubisco  <cit> , decreasing photorespiration  <cit>  and adding new biosynthetic pathways to increase the flow of carbon into useful products  <cit> . however, efforts to improve chloroplast-related processes may be constrained by known and unknown factors. for example, increasing photosynthetic rates by engineering photosynthetic pathways may overburden the capacity of the transport systems inside and outside of the chloroplast  <cit> . exploring and analyzing the complexity of photosynthetic regulation in field conditions may identify these constraints and allow researchers to bypass potential difficulties.

the role of the nucleus should command particular attention among the mechanisms regulating photosynthesis. the chloroplast, as the site of photosynthesis, requires adaptive changes in the expression levels of nuclear genes to respond to endogenous and environmental stimuli; a complex signaling network regulates these changes in gene expression  <cit> . chloroplast and chloroplast-related processes have been studied in detail  <cit> . the higher plant nuclear genome encodes about  <dig>  predicted chloroplast proteins , and chloroplast metabolism is tightly integrated with the rest of the cell   <cit> . hence, the nucleus plays a crucial role in maintaining normal function of the chloroplast  <cit> .

nuclear genes provide potential targets for improving photosynthetic efficiency. for example, rubisco, the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of co <dig> into ribulose  <dig> -bisphosphate , is a prime target for genetic engineering to improve photosynthetic efficiency  <cit> , but the locations of rbcl in the chloroplast genome and rbcs in the nuclear genome have hindered this approach  <cit> . various other biological processes regulated by the nucleus  <cit>  also may be useful targets for improving photosynthesis, such as plant morphology  <cit> , photoprotection  <cit> , and the regulation of photosynthesis by the sophisticated balance of energy  <cit>  and redox  <cit> . however, the nuclear genes involved in the regulation of photosynthesis remain poorly understood, especially in trees, despite the importance of nuclear genes in all photosynthesis-related processes. trees are extremely long-lived and generate woody biomass derived from plant cell wall lignocellulose. so, in trees, the mechanisms of nuclear regulation of photosynthesis may be even more complicated than in herbaceous annuals.

studies of the regulation of photosynthesis have mainly focused on the influence of environmental factors or the interaction with other biological processes. most stresses, including biotic  <cit> , chilling  <cit> , drought  <cit>  and salt  <cit>  stress, repress photosynthesis. ecosystem respiration is tightly coupled with canopy photosynthesis  <cit> . also, transport mechanisms and efficiency influence photosynthetic productivity by relieving product inhibition and contribute to plant vigor by controlling source/sink relationships and biomass partitioning  <cit> . however, little is known about the role of nuclear genes in photosynthesis. populus, as a model for long-lived woody perennials  <cit> , can be used to study the molecular basis of regulation of photosynthesis at the genome scale in woody plants. based on the high-quality, annotated genome sequence of populus trichocarpa <cit> , emerging research has investigated biological functions in woody plants including wood formation, seasonality, flowering control, dormancy release, senescence, biotic interactions and abiotic stress responses  <cit> .

in the present study, we used a segregating population of poplars with different net photosynthetic rates , to identify and characterize nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis in trees, by combining microarray techniques and bulked segregant analysis . to our knowledge, this is the first systematic, genome-wide investigation of differentially expressed genes in pools of progeny with different photosynthetic rates in populus. we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes in this population according to the fold change  of gene expression . also, we outlined a putative gene network in the populus nuclear genome for regulation of photosynthesis. furthermore, the differentially expressed genes identified here may be suitable targets for biotechnological manipulation to improve photosynthesis.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation and correlation
for this study, we used a linkage mapping population of 1200 f <dig> progeny, from the cross of two elite poplar parents, the female hybrid clone “yx01”  and the male clone “lm50” . we first characterized the variation in photosynthetic characteristics, including pn, stomatal conductance , intercellular co <dig> concentration  and transpiration rate , in this population. the photosynthetic characteristics pn, cond, ci, and trmmol of the 1200 f <dig> individuals had a continuous distribution indicating that all measured traits were quantitatively inherited and each trait showed significant differences in the population . means of the four photosynthetic characteristics were:  <dig>  ±  <dig>   μmol · m−2 · s− <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mol · m−2 · s− <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol · mol− <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g · m−2 · h− <dig>  and their coefficients of variation  ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the cv of pn and ci were similar, at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . we also measured three growth traits and four wood property traits. cvs of growth traits including tree height , diameter at chest height  and stem volume  were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. for d, we define “chest height” as  <dig>  meters above the ground. wood traits showed lower cvs; for example, the cv of holocellulose content was the smallest, at just  <dig> %. descriptive statistics of the trait distributions are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the broad sense heritability  was estimated for each trait  ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. pn had the highest h <dig> value, followed by cond, v, d, trmmol, h, ci, lignin content, microfiber angle and α-cellulose content. the h <dig> of holocellulose content was lowest. higher h <dig> values were observed in photosynthetic characteristics and growth traits .

the phenotypic and genetic correlations between photosynthesis and growth and wood quality traits measured were summarized in table  <dig>  the genetic correlations were in general stronger than the respective phenotypic correlations. as expected, the growth traits displayed significant positive phenotypic and genetic correlations with photosynthetic traits in the population . for example, pn was significantly positively correlated with all growth traits  including h, d and v. genetic correlations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , suggesting that photosynthesis may have a direct correlation with plant growth. however, we did not observe a significant genetic correlation between the photosynthetic traits  and three wood chemical traits . this suggested that photosynthesis may only indirectly influence wood chemical properties, and indicates that these biological pathways are very complex. we observed significant correlations between wood traits ; for example, lignin content was negatively correlated with holocellulose content  and α-cellulose content . conversely, lignin content was positively correlated with microfiber angle  .

identification of differentially expressed genes
to find nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis, we compared the gene expression profiles of pools constructed by bulked segregant analysis   <cit> . specifically, we identified plants with very high and very low photosynthetic rate . plants with high or low pn were pooled and compared. microarray-based comparison of the fc of gene expression between the pools with high and low photosynthetic efficiency showed that only  <dig> % of all probes  showed a significant difference . of these,  <dig> probes were up-regulated  and  <dig> were down-regulated  in plants with high pn, compared to the plants with low pn. the fact that most of the significantly differentially expressed genes were repressed in plants with high pn  may be explained because plants under field conditions rarely realize their maximum photosynthetic potential  <cit> . of the differentially expressed genes,  <dig> were annotated as having no known function  and of these,  <dig>  were up-regulated , suggesting that they were bona fide candidates for novel, up-regulated photosynthesis genes.

verification of the differentially expressed genes identified by microarray
we confirmed the transcriptional regulation measured by microarray in a biologically independent experiment using real time-pcr  with gene-specific primers . we chose ten differentially expressed genes, including five up- and five down-regulated genes, in plants with high pn, compared to plants with low pn, to assess the accuracy of the microarray data. we selected the set of genes to have functions covering all putative biological progresses affecting photosynthesis, including: hormone signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, response to stress, response to redox, transcript regulation and transport . rt-pcr expression analysis and t-test analysis  indicated significant differences between the groups with high and low photosynthetic rate, consistent with the microarray data , and a pearson’s product–moment correlation test showed a positive correlation  between the microarray and rt-pcr data. in addition, the expression pattern in high and low pn pools was highly consistent for individuals within each pool  . the results indicated that the microarray experiments in this study are sufficiently reliable for identification of nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis in populus.

go analysis and co-expression patterns
to functionally characterize the differentially expressed genes, we used categorizer  to analyze the go terms for all the identified genes. for biological process , the most prevalent go slim categories were cellular process , metabolic process  and single-organism process , suggesting a high degree of basic metabolic activity in the regulation of nuclear genes in photosynthesis . to identify significantly enriched go terms, we used singular enrichment analysis  on the differentially expressed genes. we identified  <dig> significantly enriched go terms in: molecular functions , biological processes  and cell components  . eighteen of the enriched terms specify various metabolic or catabolic processes, for categories based on biological process . the terms mostly relate to energy metabolism and biomass formation . this suggested that metabolism plays an important role in regulation of nuclear genes in photosynthesis. for molecular functions, we found enrichment of terms involved in transcription, such as transcription factor activity  and sequence-specific dna binding . also, sea showed a significant difference between up- and down-regulated terms . go terms of the up-regulated genes were enriched for cell components including cell wall  and external encapsulating structure . by contrast, go terms of the down-regulated genes were enriched in molecular functions. this analysis revealed that the nuclear genome participated in photosynthesis via different processes.

fdr false discovery rate.

to examine the co-expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, we used hierarchical clustering to classify the differentially expressed genes, based on their expression patterns, into  <dig> clusters . two expression patterns  were observed in most clusters, but the genes in cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> were all repressed . after sea on each cluster, in cluster  <dig>  we identified five significant go terms, including polysaccharide metabolic process , carbohydrate metabolic process , hydrolase activity, acting on glycosyl bonds , hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing o-glycosyl compounds  and hydrolase activity . cluster  <dig> includes genes such as endoxyloglucan transferase, glycosyl hydrolase, beta-glucosidase, and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein, which encode hydrolases or transferases that act on xyloglucans in construction, modification, and degradation of plant cell walls. this result suggests that the expression of these genes is similarly regulated and these cell wall processes may be related to photosynthesis.

categories of differentially expressed genes involved in photosynthesis
the differentially expressed genes involved in photosynthesis were enriched in some groups including genes coordinating with organelles, and genes related to: the plant cell wall, response to stimulus, transport and redox. we also looked for organellar proteins and found  <dig> differentially expressed genes that encode proteins with known arabidopsis homologs that localize in the chloroplast and/or mitochondrion . gene expression ratios for the putative organellar proteins varied from  <dig> - to  <dig> - and  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold. a representation of the differentially expressed genes is shown in additional file 10: figure s2a. of these,  <dig> % of mitochondrion-located genes were down-regulated . this reveals that regulatory functions may be coordinated between nuclei and organelles in photosynthesis. we also identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in cell wall functions . the sea analysis in all different expression genes showed that cell wall macromolecule catabolic process , cell wall macromolecule metabolic process  and cell wall organization or biogenesis  were significantly enriched go terms . however, the up- and down-regulated genes showed different related biological processes; most of the up-regulated genes related to plant cell wall growth and most of the down-regulated genes related to response for stimulus .

we also detected  <dig> genes affecting response to stimulus, and most of them  were down-regulated . guided by the arabidopsis homologs, via mapman   <cit> , we found that many are involved in biotic stress, such as hormone signaling , transcription factors , and abiotic stress . this suggested that response to stimulus was an important part of regulation of photosynthesis at the genome scale.

transporters perform many important physiological functions, including the transport and distribution of photosynthetic assimilates. hence, it was no surprise that genes related to transport were identified. we detected  <dig> differentially expressed genes  related to transport . gene families of these differentially expressed genes included abc , mfs , mip , opt , slah , pin and other families. most of the down-regulated genes encoded proteins predicted to locate in the membrane and conduct energy-related transport. this suggested that genes related to transport also affect photosynthetic rate. photosynthesis has a high risk for producing photo-oxidative damage and generates redox intermediates with strong redox potentials . go term enrichment analysis revealed that the biological process ‘oxidation reduction’  was also significantly enriched . four genes encoding glutathione transferase, one encoding glutathione and one encoding glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase were detected and all were slightly repressed in plants with high pn, from  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold . also, three nadh dehydrogenases, two nadh/ubiquinone/plastoquinones  and two nadph oxidases were repressed . this suggested that the regulation of redox plays a crucial role in photosynthesis.

polymorphic snp loci associated with traits affecting photosynthesis
for functional examination of the differentially expressed genes identified in this study, we looked for association of snps with photosynthetic traits. we selected six candidate genes known to be involved in primary cell wall formation, hormone signaling and response to stress. we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms  in each gene and carried out single snp marker analysis with the photosynthesis parameters in our segregating population. . we found  <dig> common snps with a minor allele frequency greater than  <dig> . of these,  <dig> are in exon regions,  <dig> in 5′utrs,  <dig> in introns, and  <dig> in the 3′utr regions . we conducted  <dig>  single-marker analyses to account for linear regression by single factor anova . we identified  <dig> associations that were significant at the threshold of p <  <dig>  and multiple test corrections using the fdr  method reduced this number to  <dig> at a significance threshold of fdr <  <dig>  . we identified significant associations with pn , cond , ci , trmmol  and tree height  in the population . the  <dig> associations represented  <dig> snp loci from the six candidate genes. four candidate genes exhibited significant associations with at least three photosynthesis traits, suggesting pleiotropic effects or causal relationships among certain traits . of these, association of gasa <dig>  with cond and pn explained up to  <dig> % and 8%, respectively, of the phenotypic variance we observed in the population. most loci explained a small proportion of the phenotypic variance ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. these small snp effects are in accordance with polygenic quantitative models of complex traits  <cit> , and support the opinion that photosynthesis should be examined on a whole-plant level.

regulatory network of nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis
after we identified differentially expressed genes, we constructed a gene network  to reflect the processes and organelles that the nuclear genome controls in photosynthesis. the main cell components included chloroplasts , mitochondria  and the cell wall . it seemed likely that the nucleus affects the structure of chloroplasts and the regulation of chloroplast gene expression, the coordination of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and modification of the cell wall in defense or growth. according to the annotation, regulation of the nuclear genome involving photosynthesis mainly involved: transport , metabolism  and response to stimulus . of these, metabolism involved a number of physiological and biochemical processes including carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, fatty acids and energy. this suggested that the regulation of the nuclear genome concentrated on various biological processes  rather than just affecting chloroplast-related processes   <cit>  although coordination between the nucleus and chloroplast was crucial in maintaining normal photosynthesis.

discussion
our study identified  <dig> nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis in populus under field conditions. based on our analysis of these differentially expressed genes, we constructed a gene network , which revealed the role of nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis under field conditions in populus. the major processes identified by these genes include response to stimulus, metabolism, and transport. this study provides new genome-scale strategies for the discovery of potential candidate genes affecting photosynthesis in populus, and also for identification of gene functions involved in the regulation of photosynthesis.

genes coordinating with organelles
enzymatic and photosynthetic complexes within chloroplasts contain subunits encoded by the nuclear and plastid genomes  <cit> , and chloroplasts and mitochondria interact with the nucleus. hence, we compared our study with previous studies to find genes involved in coordinating nuclear functions with organelles  at the genome scale under field conditions. we detected  <dig> differentially expressed genes encoding putative organellar proteins . the largest groups of differentially expressed genes included genes involved in metabolism , photosynthesis  and genes with unknown function  . of these,  <dig> % of mitochondrion-located genes were down-regulated  including acyl activating enzyme , enoyl-coa hydratase/isomerase , and cytochrome p <dig> . most of these genes play particularly important roles in different metabolic processes, including energy metabolism or downstream molecular functions affecting metabolic processes. for example, enoyl-coa hydratase/isomerase indicates an effect on the β-oxidation pathway, which might change carbon flux  entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle  <cit> . the large cytochrome p <dig> of plant metabolic enzymes catalyze a huge variety of oxidation reactions in microbes and higher organisms  <cit> . mitochondrial oxidative metabolism modulates the coordination between different components of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in chloroplasts, such as generation and use of assimilatory power , induction of photosynthesis, maintenance of metabolites and the light activation of calvin cycle enzymes  <cit> . the above considerations indicate that the mitochondrion plays an important role in photosynthesis.

as expected, we detected nuclear genes involved construction or development of chloroplasts  . for example, the gene encoding atp-dependent clp protease regulatory subunit, an essential housekeeping enzyme in chloroplasts  <cit> , was down-regulated by  <dig> -fold. psbp-like protein is an extrinsic subunit of eukaryotic photosystem ii  and participates in the normal function of photosynthetic water oxidation; the up-regulation of this gene  revealed that nuclear genes control photosynthesis by affecting the structure or development of chloroplasts.

we found that co-ordination between the nucleus and chloroplast was a crucial but small part of the nuclear regulation of photosynthesis. we did not identify significant go terms involving chloroplast-related processes. after comparing our results to a previous study, we identified just  <dig> genes  in the analysis of  <dig> nuclear transcriptomes, which revealed  <dig> distinct regulons and their relationship in coordination of nuclear and plastid gene expression  <cit>  . however, genes related to other complex biological processes were identified in our study. hence, we consider the regulation of photosynthesis in trees should be viewed on a whole-plant scale.

the role of the cell wall in photosynthesis
we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in cell wall functions . although a similar number of genes were up-  and down-regulated  , the constitution of related biological processes clearly differed. most of the up-regulated genes were related to plant cell wall growth, such as expansins  and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase . conversely, most of the down-regulated genes were related to response for stimulus, such as chitinase  and pathogenesis-related protein . this revealed that photosynthesis may be positively correlated with growth and negatively correlated with stress.

as expected, we detected genes related to carbohydrate active enzymes , which function in the formation and modification of the carbohydrate matrix of wood cell walls, including genes encoding cellulose synthase-like , pectin methyl esterases , xyloglucan endo-transglucosylases and hydrolases , and expansins  <cit> . these proteins play crucial roles in assimilating the products of photosynthesis into sugars and starch, in synthesizing cell wall biopolymers and in creating various glycosylated compounds  <cit> . most of the carbohydrate-related genes  were slightly up-regulated, by  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold, indicating that high photosynthetic rate was related to carbohydrate activity. of these, csls , which are good candidates for the synthases forming the β-d-glycan backbone of hemicelluloses such as xyloglucan, xylan, mannan and other β-d-glycans in the cell wall, were up-regulated  <cit> . pmes, which were among the up and down-regulated genes, have major roles in pectin remodeling  <cit> . these genes influence cell wall remodeling, which may largely contribute to internal carbon recycling and thus ultimately affect photosynthesis  <cit> .

xet specifically cuts the backbone of xyloglucan and re-forms a glycosidic bond with the free end of another xyloglucan chain  <cit> . we found that the gene encoding xet was up-regulated by up to  <dig> -fold in the poplars with higher photosynthetic efficiency. as the most abundant hemicellulose in the primary cell wall in many dicotyledonous plants, xyloglucan has a backbone of β1 → 4-linked glucose residues. this may be affected by sugar signaling pathways, as sucrose is the major photosynthetic product and affects growth and metabolism  <cit> . this also supports the present result that four snp markers from a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase precursor  showed a significant association with four photosynthetic characteristics . of these, a significant snp  detected in the 5′ utr may affect many post-transcriptional regulatory pathways. the t-c mutation in xet-snp <dig> causes a leucine to proline amino acid substitution and the g-c mutation at xet-snp <dig> causes an alanine to proline substitution. these findings suggest that xet may function downstream of photosynthesis and play an important role in the balance of glucose. in populus, at least  <dig> xth genes, likely encoding xets, were expressed in developing xylem, indicating that the amount of nascent xyloglucan relative to xet was an important determinant of whether xet strengthens or loosens the cell wall  <cit> . this supports the idea that this gene is involved in photosynthesis in populus.

we found that of the genes down-regulated in plants with high photosynthetic efficiency were related to stress responses, such as pi , chitinase  <cit>  and pathogenesis-related protein  <cit> , and the fold change of these genes was as low as  <dig>  . of these, pi-snp <dig>  a noncoding marker within a gene from the pr- <dig> proteinase inhibitor family constituting a sub-class of serine pis with characteristics of potato/tomato type i pis  <cit> , was the only single-marker association with a growth trait  in single marker analysis . plants stringently govern pi activity to achieve cellular homeostasis. we suppose that pi activity relates to tree height through its effect on the water-stress response. current hypotheses for tree height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis  <cit> . also, pis were up-regulated under water stress both in soybean  <cit>  and maize  <cit> .

photosynthesis and hormone
plant hormones, a group of chemically diverse small molecules, direct processes ranging from growth and development to biotic and abiotic stress responses. in this study, the stimulus response category related to hormone responses included saur , aux , gasa , gid  and some genes responding to other hormones . the genes showed clear differences between up- and down-regulated gene sets. for instance, all the gids were down-regulated and the vast majority of saur, aux and gasa genes, which function in different processes throughout plant growth and development  <cit> , were up-regulated. for example, saurs function as primary auxin response genes hypothesized to be involved in auxin signaling pathways. they were up-regulated by  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold. genes encoding auxin efflux carrier family proteins were also up-regulated, suggesting that photosynthetic activity might increase auxin content to affect development  <cit> . the effect of ga on photosynthesis has been controversial  <cit> . in our study, a gene encoding gasa was up-regulated by  <dig> -fold. the snp marker in gasa showed a significant association with two photosynthetic traits . phenotypic variance for cond and pn explained by the gasa-snp <dig> marker was up to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. our result supports the idea that photosynthesis was at least indirectly ga-responsive, an idea further supported by a study in which ga <dig> treatment increased photosynthetic activity  <cit> .

photosynthesis and stress
environmental factors limit photosynthesis, so plants rarely realize their maximum photosynthetic potential under field conditions  <cit> . hence, it was not surprising that we found genes related to stress in this study. stress-related genes likely play roles in protecting photosynthetic functions, metabolizing the factors that inhibit photosynthesis  <cit>  and maintaining cell homeostasis. for example, we found that peroxiredoxin was down-regulated by  <dig> -fold in the poplars with high photosynthetic efficiency . it encodes peroxiredoxin q, which decomposes peroxides and plays a role in the protection of the photosynthetic apparatus  <cit> . also glutathione-transferase   is induced by diverse environmental stimuli, with increased gst levels used to maintain cell redox homeostasis and protect organisms from oxidative stress, which can seriously affect leaf photosynthetic machinery  <cit> . also, we found that nuclear genes affect endogenous and environmental stimuli and regulate key proteins responding to stress. we detected  <dig> wrky transcription factors, important functional components for plant stress responses, as being down-regulated. wrkys relate to tolerance to wounding, heat, cold, nacl, sugar, drought, oxidative stress and others  <cit>  .

sea analysis showed an enrichment of terms involving chitinase, such as chitin catabolic process , chitin metabolic process , chitinase activity  and chitin binding  . chitinase protects plants against fungal pathogens by degrading chitin, a major component of the cell walls of many fungi . fragments from chitin and chitosan have elicitor activities leading to a variety of defense responses in host plants in response to microbial infection  <cit> , including induction of pathogen-related proteins and pi, which were also identified in this study.

most genes involved in stress response were down-regulated, such as pi, chitinase, peroxidase, heat shock protein  <cit>  and pathogenesis-related protein. for example, all six genes encoding peroxidase, a plant-specific oxidoreductase affecting responses to environmental stimuli  <cit> , were repressed, down to  <dig> -fold. also, peroxiredoxins play important roles in plant development, environmental adaptation, and disease resistance  <cit> , and this gene was repressed too. this result could be considered from two aspects. first, low photosynthetic rate led to less production of sugar and energy, resulting in a decline in plant adaptability  <cit> . second, plants with good environmental adaptability could grow and thus had a high photosynthetic rate. all the above results suggest that nuclear regulation of the response for stress is an important part of photosynthesis. this suggests that improving plant stress tolerance may enhance photosynthetic efficiency in field conditions.

photosynthesis and metabolism
the relationship between metabolism and photosynthesis is complex, involving photosynthate production , energy and nutrition. cell wall carbohydrate metabolic processes were highlighted in this study. this suggests that nuclear genes may affect photosynthesis by regulating polysaccharides in the cell wall for a possible source of sugar. for example, the identified cell wall-bound β-glucosidase was repressed  in high photosynthetic rate pools . it breaks down polysaccharides to soluble sugars when photosynthesis declines. also, reduced photosynthesis results in enhancement of β-glucosidase activity  <cit> .

energy metabolism was also detected in our study. the complex network of plant energy metabolism involves photosynthesis, photorespiration, nitrogen and sulfur reduction, and other molecules  <cit> . our study identified genes affecting atp/nadph, such as adp-ribose pyrophosphatase, nadh dehydrogenase, nadh/ubiquinone/plastoquinone , and nadph oxidase . most of these genes also play roles in redox. the gene encoding adp-ribose pyrophosphatase , conferred enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress in arabidopsis plants, resulting from maintenance of nad + and atp levels by nucleotide recycling from free adp-ribose molecules  <cit> . also, plant extracellular atp results in the activation of plasma membrane nadph oxidases, causing the production of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . in addition, nadh dehydrogenases are related to respiratory complex i, and mediate photosystem i cyclic electron flow. hence, we consider that energy metabolism is an aspect of the nuclear regulation of photosynthesis.

photosynthesis and transport proteins
transporters perform many important physiological functions, including the transport and distribution of photosynthetic assimilates. however, our study did not detect the well-known sucrose transporters, such as sucrose uptake transporters   <cit> . this result may be caused by annotation of differentially expressed genes, which should be improved in future work. for example, mfs, a typical representative of secondary transporters and the largest known superfamily of secondary carriers found in the biosphere  <cit> , was detected in our study . plant sucrose transporters belong to this superfamily and can mediate carbohydrate transport across cell membranes  <cit> . abc transporters, arguably the most important family of atp-driving transporters in biology, have been implicated in a broad range of processes, including polar auxin transport, disease resistance, and stomatal function  <cit> . in a study of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus,  <dig> abc transport system substrate-binding proteins were predicted to function as carbohydrate transporters  <cit> .

transport proteins are embedded in the membrane to enable the passage of metabolites and thereby connect metabolic networks beyond organelle boundaries  <cit> . transporters may affect photosynthetic rate via metabolite transport, hormone signaling and sustaining cell homeostasis. the transport proteins we detected include phosphate transporter , pin1-like auxin transport protein  and potassium channel kat <dig>  . transport proteins are important for achieving high rates of photosynthetic carbon assimilation  <cit> . also, in hormone signaling, pin transporters  play important roles in directional auxin distribution within tissues  <cit> . recent studies have suggested that the hak family transporters  are potentially involved in k+ homeostasis and osmotic regulation in plants  <cit> . also, transport plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis for adaptation to environmental stress  <cit> . for example, the opt family consists of electrochemical potential–driven transporters  <cit> . atopt <dig> can mediate uptake of glutathione derivatives and metal complexes, indicating that it may also be involved in redox homeostasis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we report the genome-wide identification and characterization of nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis. this study detected  <dig> differentially expressed genes in a segregating linkage population of poplar . our study suggests that improving photosynthetic efficiency should consider different regulatory levels, rather than just the primary reactions of carbon assimilation under field conditions. our study also reflects a general picture of regulation of photosynthesis from the nucleus in a normal environment. this study will be a part of further analysis using systems biology, a multidisciplinary science that uses large data sets to generate hypotheses about a dynamic system and has been effectively used to study signaling networks  <cit> . identification and characterization of nuclear genes involved in photosynthesis in populus provides new insights in the molecular mechanisms that regulate photosynthesis in field and information that may enable efforts to improve photosynthetic efficiency in trees.
