BACKGROUND
prolactin-related proteins  are non-classical members of the prolactin /growth hormone  family that have been found in bovine, caprine, murine and rat placenta. in cattle, placental lactogen  and thirteen types of placental prps have so far been reported  <cit> . in goats, pl has been detected in the placenta  <cit> , and two newly-discovered prps were reported as prl-related molecules in our recent study  <cit> . in ruminants, specifically in cattle, sheep and goats, trophoblast-specific genes such as pl  <cit> , pregnancy-associated glycoproteins   <cit> , interferon-tau   <cit> , trophoblast kunitz domain proteins   <cit>  and cathepsins   <cit>  are known to be key factors for implantation and placentation, and are expressed in trophoblast cells including trophoblast giant binucleate cells . however, no molecules similar in sequence to bovine and/or caprine prps have been reported in sheep. it is assumed that prp orthologs are involved in ovine placenta because placental prl-like molecules have been discovered in many mammals, not only in cattle and goat but also in mouse and rat  <cit> . in the present study, we identified the mrnas of two novel prps in ovine placenta and investigated their expression in the ovine placentome. we named them ovine prolactin-related protein- <dig>  and prolactin-related protein- <dig>  on the basis of similarities with cattle and goat sequences. they were translated in a hek <dig> cell transfection system, as in the case of cattle  <cit> . their lactogenic activities were confirmed by an nb <dig> lymphoma cell bioassay  <cit> . an aim of future research will be to determine the function of ruminant prp molecules that appear in the placenta. a crucial part of such a study will be to express ruminant prp in other species. the purposes of the present study are  to explore a bprp homolog gene in ovine placenta,  to investigate the localized and quantitative expression of oprp and  to examine the possible biological activity of oprp, because comparison among ruminant prp structures and/or expression may provide clues to understanding prp function.

RESULTS
oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences
full-length oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> were cloned from the ovine placentome on day  <dig> of gestation. oprp <dig> was  <dig> nucleotides  long with a 540-nts protein coding sequence region ; oprp <dig> had a 947-nts full-length sequence and a 717-nts cds. the protein sequences deduced from the full-length cdnas comprised  <dig> amino acids  in oprp <dig> and  <dig> aa in oprp <dig>  the sequence region in which oprp <dig> mrna is defective compared to other prp mrnas is shown in fig.  <dig> along with the sequences of oprp <dig>  cprp <dig> and bprp <dig>  oprp <dig> has a shorter sequence, lacking  <dig> bp from the cds regions of other prp sequences . since the reading frame of the codon is shifted at the  <dig> bp defect, the cds region became  <dig> bp.

fig.  <dig> shows a phylogenetic tree analysis based on the predicted aa sequences of the new oprps and other prolactin family members in cattle and goat. we confirmed a close phylogenetic relationship between oprp <dig> and bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig> and cprp <dig>  which have known sequences. oprp <dig> was considerably more distant from bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig> and cprp <dig> in the phylogenetic tree analysis.

the identity of oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> with the phylogenetically neighbouring prps is demonstrated in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  the n-terminal regions of the oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> proteins are rich in hydrophobic amino acid residues, which is characteristic of signal peptides. the signal peptide sequence, which is composed of  <dig> amino acids, is well conserved in the bprp and/or cprp family  <cit> . the mature oprp <dig> protein is predicted to have one disulfide bond with three cysteines . in contrast, the mature oprp <dig> protein is predicted to have three disulfide bonds with six cys. normally, cys is common to the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> positions in bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig> and cprp <dig> . in contrast, oprp <dig> lacked the cys at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  because there is no sequence corresponding to positions 180– <dig> . oprp <dig> has one potential consensus sequence for typical n-glycosylation, an asn-x-ser/thr  at positions 70– <dig> . oprp <dig> has two consensus sequences for n-glycosylation at positions 92– <dig> and 146– <dig> . another atypical n-glycosylation site, asn-x-cys , was exhibited at positions 95– <dig> in oprp <dig> . the two positions in oprp <dig> coincided with those in bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig> and bprp <dig>   <cit> . in contrast, the typical position  in oprp <dig> coincided with those in bprp <dig> and cprp <dig>  while the atypical position  coincided with those in cprp <dig> and bprp <dig>  <cit> .

the predicted 3d structures of mature oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  in general, prl family members are predicted to have four α-helices, like oprp <dig>  but oprp <dig> may have only three α-helices . the oprp <dig> sequence has a premature stop codon because the reading frame is shifted; residues 529– <dig>  in the other prp sequences are absent . the deduced molecular structure predicts that this protein lacks the fourth α-helix found in existing bovine or caprine prps . structural differences in the n-glycosylation site, the disulfide bond  between cys <dig> and cys <dig> and each atomic configuration were also exhibited .

the oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> sequences were submitted to the dna data bank of japan ; the ddbj/genbank accession numbers are ab <dig> and ab <dig> 

localization and quantitative expression of oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> mrna
specific expression of oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> mrna was detected in ovine placenta  by conventional rt-pcr. no signal was observed in other ovine tissues, i.e. heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen and endometrium.

oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> mrnas were localized by in situ hybridization in the ovine placentome . dig-labeled oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> anti-sense rna probes specifically detected the mrna transcript in the placentomes. both oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> appeared in the bnc in the cotyledonary villi area . no significant oprp <dig> or oprp <dig> signals were detected using sense probes .

quantitative expression of oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  in the placentomal tissue , the intensity of oprp <dig> expression declined from day  <dig> to day  <dig> and then remained constant to day  <dig>  the intensity of oprp <dig> expression remained constant between the early  and late  stages of gestation. in the intercotyledon , oprp <dig> expression declined from the early  to the late  stages of gestation. again, as in the placentome, oprp <dig> expression remained constant between the early  and late  stages. there was more intense oprp <dig> expression in icot than in ptm during the early  to middle  stages of gestation. in contrast, oprp <dig> expression was greater in the ptm than icot throughout pregnancy.

production of recombinant proteins
we produced oprp <dig> recombinant protein in order to investigate its lactogenic activity. cloned oprp <dig> sequences were efficiently translated in an hek <dig> cell system, as in the case of bovine prps   <cit> . a flag-tag fusion oprp <dig> protein was translated at approximately  <dig> kda . we also tried to produce recombinant oprp <dig> protein in a mammalian cell system but were unable to do so.

lactogenic activity of prp
ovine prl  stimulated nb <dig> lymphoma cell proliferation effectively, and another lactogenic protein, bovine pl, showed stimulatory activity . no stimulatory activity was detected in recombinant oprp <dig>  as for bprp <dig> 

discussion
the diversity of the prl gene family has been demonstrated in mouse, rat, cattle and goat, but functional information about these proteins is limited except for prl, pl and some rodent prolactin-like proteins   <cit> . in particular, ruminants commonly have various genes of this family, but there is no information regarding sheep, even though anatomical evidence shows that placentae are similar among bovidae  <cit> . thirteen varieties of prp paralogs have been reported in bovines and two in goat  <cit> . in the present study, we have identified novel prps in sheep and compared the properties of sheep and cattle/goat.

the novel oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> genes were detected in and cloned from ovine placenta and oprp <dig> was deduced to have a shortened amino acid sequence. phylogenetic analysis suggests that prp molecules evolved as ruminant species diverged, because these ovine prps are phylogenetically adjacent to caprine and bovine prps .

we confirmed the short variant form of prp in ovine placenta . although there is no report that short variant forms result from alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage in non-classical members of the prl family, namely bovine prp, caprine prp, mouse prlp and rat prlp  <cit> , short variants of bpl and prl have been reported  <cit> . two types of short bpl variant are formed by alternative splicing  <cit> . one has a premature stop codon because of a shift in the reading frame. although the defective position in the bpl variant sequence was similar to that in oprp <dig>  bpl lacked only  <dig> bp in this region. it is not yet known whether the short bpl variant exists or what function it may have. some structural variants of prl proteins have been confirmed in various mammalian species  <cit> . a short fragment of prl protein has also been confirmed in rat, mouse and human  <cit> . although these short prl  molecules may result from alternative splicing, they could also be generated by proteolytic cleavage. the cleavage site  almost coincides with the position of the oprp <dig> stop codon. these short prls in mouse and human are known to have potential as inhibitors of capillary endothelial cell proliferation  <cit> . the short prl in rat produces an anti-angiogenic effect via an unique, high-affinity, saturable receptor that is different from the prl receptor  <cit> . whether oprp <dig> corresponds to the short prl receptor is not certain, because full-length prl binds to the prl receptor and some ruminant prps do not. however, one hypothesis may be that oprp <dig> has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, because the sequence length and the mature protein region are similar to those of the short prl variants in human and rodents. members of the rodent prl superfamily, namely prolactin-like proteins , proliferins  and proliferin-related protein , are non-classical and have several specific activities such as angiogenesis  <cit> , hematopoiesis  <cit>  and immunomodulation  <cit> . a possible hypothetical function for oprp <dig> may be in the regulation of angiogenesis, but its actual function remains to be clarified.

primary expression of oprp <dig> and oprp <dig> mrna was observed in bnc . the localization of oprp mrnas is similar to that of prp family members in other ruminants  <cit> . the mrnas of both oprps were detected in the ptm and icot tissues throughout pregnancy . however, the expression patterns were different; oprp <dig> expression declined with the progress of the pregnancy in ptm and icot, but in contrast, oprp <dig> expression remained constant throughout pregnancy. however, there seems to be a discrepancy between the localization and quantitative expression of oprp2: quantitative real-time rt-pcr  data suggest that oprp <dig> may be expressed not only in bnc but also in conventional trophoblast cells, as in bovine  <cit> . in bprp expression profiles, four types of expression pattern were found during pregnancy in ptm:  genes expressed around the window;  genes with peak expression around mid-gestation;  genes that show increasing expression during the progression of gestation and peak late in gestation;  genes with approximately constant expression throughout gestation  <cit> . in the present study, although expression was not determined during the implantation period, oprp <dig> expression may correspond to the type  pattern. in contrast, oprp <dig> expression might be type  but without lactogenic activity. the functional significance of short prps and various other kinds of prp in ruminant placenta is still unclear. we could produce recombinant oprp <dig> protein as well as proteins of other ruminant species   <cit> . only the absence of lactogenic activity is clearly confirmed for recombinant oprp <dig> and bprp <dig> by a bioassay using nb <dig> lymphoma cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have cloned two novel prolactin-related protein genes in ovine placentome. the ovine prp sequences have a high homology with bovine prp. however, oprp <dig> has a premature stop codon, which has not been discovered in bovine and caprine prps. oprps were expressed in trophoblast bnc, as are bovine or caprine prps. their mrnas were expressed throughout gestation. oprp <dig> mrna declined with the progress of gestation; oprp <dig> mrna remained constant throughout. oprp <dig> produced mature recombinant protein in a mammalian cell-expression system. we confirmed that oprp <dig> is lactogenically inactive, as oprp <dig> treatment did not induce proliferation of nb <dig> lymphoma cells.
