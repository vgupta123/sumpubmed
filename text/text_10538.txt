BACKGROUND
snake venoms comprise a diverse array of toxins that have a variety of biochemical and pharmacological functions and can be conveniently classified as hemotoxins and neurotoxins  <cit> . recently, it has been documented that most of the snake toxins were recruited or derived from normal body proteins in the common ancestor of venomous squamates  or advanced snakes  100- <dig> million years ago   <cit> . associated with the species radiation of advanced snakes in the cenozoic era, a predator-prey arms race led to the explosive appearance of toxic arsenals, and typically, several toxin multigene families were generated by gene duplication, followed by fast diversification  <cit> . the birth-and-death model was proposed to explain the emergence of taxon-specific toxin groups  <cit> ; i.e., new toxin genes consistently emerged through gene duplication with the divergence of taxa, but some toxin genes got deleted or were degenerated in other lineages. however, due to the low-depth sequencing of toxin transcripts for each species, fast evolution of toxin genes, and lack of genome sequences, the detailed elaboration of snake venom evolution is still unclear.

the elapidae family , which has approximately  <dig> venomous snakes in  <dig> genera, is a monophyletic group among advanced snakes  <cit> . several broad radiated lineages  have been identified within the elapidae, including the afro-asian cobras, oriental kraits, asian-american corals, and australian and marine snakes, which are well known to be the most toxic snakes in the world. so far, the gene expression profiles of venom glands from four species  <cit>  have been reported using est sequencing. however, the kraits  and cobras , as the most diverse and representative toxic elapids in the old world  <cit> , lack genomic and venom est data.

in the present study, we prepared cdna libraries from the venom glands of the two representative old world elapid snakes, bungarus multicinctus and naja atra, and sequenced about  <dig> clones for each library. we also constructed genomic bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries for the two snakes and conducted a screen for venom genes. our results identified many new snake toxins, such as multiple groups of 3ftxs, some novel lectins, and a peculiar natriuretic peptide , and revealed that toxin genes have experienced rapid evolution and gene expansion.

RESULTS
venom gland cdna libraries and ests
we constructed two cdna libraries from the venom gland tissues of b. multicinctus and n. atra, respectively, and randomly selected  <dig> and  <dig> clones for sequencing. from these clones, we successfully obtained  <dig> expressed sequences tags  for b. multicinctus and  <dig> ests for n. atra. using cap <dig> software with a cutoff of 95% identity  <cit> , the b. multicinctus ests were grouped into  <dig> clusters , whereas the n. atra ests were grouped into  <dig> clusters . using blast for functional annotation, complete lists with putative gene identifications for these est clusters are provided in additional file  <dig>  most ests could be matched to reported snake toxins . the toxin clusters showed notably high redundancy , in contrast to the low redundancy of non-toxin clusters  , indicating that the toxin genes were highly expressed.

in this study, we focused on the toxin ests; i.e.,  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets in b. multicinctus, and  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets in n. atra . except the dominant 3ftx, we also observed eight less relatively abundant venom families both in b. multicinctus and n. atra: phospholipase a <dig> , c-type lectins, kunitz-type protease inhibitor , l-amino oxidase , nerve growth factor , cysteine-rich secretory protein , and vespryn. however, np, presynaptic  bungarotoxin, prothrombin activator , and acetylcholinesterase were only detected in b. multicinctus, while metalloproteinase and cystatin were only found in n. atra.

in snake venoms, 3ftx, pla <dig>  kunitz, c-type lectins, and metalloproteinase have been reported to be the major multigene toxin families  <cit> , and they comprised  <dig> % in b. multicinctus and  <dig> % in n. atra in our toxin est data. we also identified a peculiar cluster of np precursors with tandem nps. besides, β bungarotoxin is a bungarous-specific toxin, which is a heterodimeric protein complex of phospholipase a <dig>  and kunitz peptides  covalently linked by one disulphide bridge  <cit> . here, we detected  <dig> clusters  of a chain of β bungarotoxin and  <dig> clusters  of b chain as a major toxin in b. multicinctus .

analysis of toxin genes
three-finger toxins 
3ftxs are neurotoxins and can bind to very different neurological targets ; some of them also have non-neurotoxic activities   <cit> . its family members have a similar structure, with three loops and four conserved disulfide bridges, and contain about 60- <dig> amino acid residues. the ancestral 3ftx was thought to have  <dig> cysteines and acquired some amelioration: deletion of the ancestral c <dig> and c <dig> cysteines potentiated alpha-neurotoxic activity and acquired additional newly evolved cysteines  <cit> . in  <dig>  fry grouped  <dig> types of 3ftxs from  <dig> protein sequences, with a number of "orphan groups" of 3ftxs whose functional roles are not yet known  <cit> . since then, many other kinds of 3ftxs have been successively detected  <cit> . so far, more than five hundred variant 3ftx sequences across the entire advanced snakes have been observed. a birth-and-death mode  <cit>  and a mechanism of duplication and divergence  <cit> , allowing venom snakes to adapt to a variety of prey, were proposed to explain the generation of the 3ftx superfamily. but, the evolutionary relationships of all kinds of 3ftxs are still uncertain, such as the notable alpha neurotoxic clades , which are not monophyletic, based on the phylogenetic tree of 3ftxs constructed by fry  <cit> . it is in contrast to previous hypotheses that alpha neurotoxins  diverged from a common ancestral gene that separated before the divergence of the elapid sub-family  <cit> .

the analysis of the b. multicinctus 3ftxs revealed that  <dig> clones  could be grouped into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets, and a total of  <dig> n. atra clones  fell into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets. we notice that all the contig sequences encoded full-length proteins, except two contigs , which are lacking exon <dig>  probably resulting from alternative splicing. since 3ftxs are the dominant toxins in both b. multicinctus and n. atra and show a greater diversity of family members, we classified them basically based on the number of cysteines following the nomenclature of fry  <cit>  . divergence analysis shows that four of the 3ftx groups had relatively low intra-divergence levels. three of the groups--long chain α-ntx , cytotoxin , and short chain α-ntx --were much more abundant than the rest of the 3ftxs . the other group, orphan gourp ii , have  <dig> cysteines and thus could be considered as an ancestral-like 3ftx group.

if the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate  for one protein-coding sequence is significantly higher than  <dig>  it indicates a trend toward accelerated evolution. because short coding sequences of 3ftxs have high variation  with multiple indels or even frameshifts between different 3ftx toxin groups, this maybe led to inaccurate multiple alignments and ambiguous phylogenetic relationships. so, we only computed dn/ds rates within each of the four major 3ftx groups using paml  <cit> . we observed that many dn/ds values are large than  <dig> . as an extreme example, we noticed that the two dominating 3ftx contigs  occupied  <dig> % of all toxin ests in n. atra, and all of the  <dig> differences between these two cytotoxin contigs were non-synonymous substitutions, which is significantly different from neutral expectation  by fisher's exact test  <cit> , suggesting a recently accelerated diversification in this major group of 3ftxs in n. atra.

gene
note: n represents number of sequences in a gene group. lc represents number of codons in the gene after alignment gaps are removed. s is the tree length, measured asqqqq the number of nucleotide substitutions per codon. ω is the estimate of the dn/ds ratio under the m <dig>  m2a or m <dig> model  <cit> . the proportions of sites under positive selection  are given under the m2a or m <dig> model. the 2Δlnl parameter in the tests of m1a versus m2a or m <dig> versus m <dig>  indicating positive selection is marked with *. *: significant at 5% level; **: significant at 1% level. pla <dig>  = phospholipase a <dig>  bbeta = b chain of β bungarotoxin, kunitz = kunitz-type protease inhibitor, metal = metalloproteinase.

we also noticed a special contig, bm <dig> , which was conspicuously different from other contigs and even had a unique signal peptide . based on the phylogenetic analysis, contig bm <dig> might have diverged from other 3ftx genes at an early stage of the origin of snakes . it is possible that bm <dig> has a conserved function and has not diversified into a multi-copy gene family.

phospholipase a <dig> and a chain of β bungarotoxin 
elapidae venom pla <dig> exerts a multiplicity of novel, nonenzymatic activities, including neurotoxic and antiplatelet activity , whereas viperid venom pla <dig> is synovial-type  pla <dig>  <cit> . the elapid pla <dig>  which has  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> or  <dig> disulfide bonds, was thought to be derived independently from nontoxic pancreatic-type pla <dig>  <cit> .

we identified four clusters of pla2-like ests with intact coding sequence  in b. multicinctus and one full-length cluster in n. atra, which covered the major pla <dig> types detected before in b. multicinctus and n. atra. in b. multicinctus, one cluster  enclosing  <dig> ests showed 100% identity with the pla <dig> sequence of b. multicinctus in genbank . another three clusters in b. multicinctus were similar to the a chain of β bungarotoxins, with a notable substitution at residue  <dig>  compared with cluster bm <dig>  which may be important for the formation of interchain disulfides in β bungarotoxin. based on the gene tree, it is clear that a chain of β bungarotoxin in b. multicinctus quite possibly duplicated from the pla <dig> gene in b. multicinctus. we estimated an average ds value of  <dig>  between pla <dig> contig bm <dig> and the a chain of β bungarotoxins, which is smaller than the ds value  between bm <dig> and the n. atra pla <dig> na <dig>  indicating that the a chain of β bungarotoxin might have derived from pla <dig> after the divergence of bungarus and naja.

kunitz-type protease inhibitor and b chain of β bungarotoxin 
kunitz belongs to the superfamily of bovine pancreatic trypsin-like inhibitors , with the ancestral function of inhibiting a diverse array of serine proteases and with a peptide chain of around  <dig> amino acid residues and  <dig> disulfide bonds  <cit> . it evolved the toxin ability to inhibit various physiological processes, such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, host defense, and action potential transduction. in elapid venoms, besides the common kunitz with trypsin or chymotrypsin inhibitor activity, the dendrotoxins in dendroaspis have presynaptic neurotoxicity  <cit> , and the b chain of β bungarotoxin is thought to act as an affinity probe to guide the a chain to its target  <cit> .

in b. multicinctus, four clusters  of the b chain of a β bungarotoxin-like sequence and one partial kunitz-type protease inhibitor-like cluster  were obtained. in n. atra, only one singlet of a kunitz-type protease inhibitor-like est was detected. to understand the evolutionary relationship of the kunitz-type protease inhibitor and b chain of β bungarotoxin, we constructed a phylogenetic tree . we also obtained an average ~ <dig>  ds value between the kunitz-type protease inhibitor and b chain of β bungarotoxin. compared with the similar ds value of  <dig>  between pla <dig> contig bm <dig> and a chain of β bungarotoxin, we propose that the a chain and b chain of β bungarotoxin evolved separately from pla <dig> and kuntiz around the same time as the common ancestor of bungarus.

c-type lectin
c-type lectins or c-type lectin-like proteins are ubiquitous components of animal venoms and contain distinct diversified subgroups, including true lectins, coagulant proteins, platelet aggregation agonists, and platelet aggregation antagonists  <cit> . the elapid c-type lectins are arranged inside the true lectins group, except one m. corallinus c-type lectin  <cit> . the true lectins cause aggregation of erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner, which are normally composed of two covalently linked identical subunits, each consisting of 135- <dig> amino acids  <cit> .

here,  <dig> c-type lectins-like ests were grouped into  <dig> clusters  in b. multicinctus, while only one contig from  <dig> ests was identified in n. atra. interestingly, all of these clones do not match the previously sequenced c-type lectins in b. multicinctus and n. atra. phylogenetic analysis revealed that a cluster of three contigs  that we sequenced were grouped separately from all of the known bungarus lectins, indicating that this is a novel cluster that diverged from the main group .

metalloproteinase
metalloproteinase is the dominant component in viperid venoms, which exerts anticoagulant or coagulant effects and results in a severe bleeding by interfering with blood coagulation and hemostatic plug formation or by degrading the basement membrane or extracellular matrix components of the victims  <cit> . but, few metalloproteinases are detected in elapids  <cit> , which produce long cdna products . here, three partial singlet ests in n. atra represented two kinds of metalloproteinase isoforms, which were respectively similar to ef <dig> in n. atra and ay <dig> in naja mossambica as p-iii type metalloproteinases.

natriuretic peptide 
the np family functions to control natriuresis, diuresis, blood pressure, homeostasis, and inhibition of aldosterone secretion in all vertebrates or is used by snakes to interrupt these physiological processes of preys  <cit>  and thus has attracted attention as ideal candidates of hypotensive and vasodilator agents. it has a conserved ring structure, consisting of  <dig> amino acids, with extensions of a few amino acids in the two termini. four major members of the np family have been indentified in vertebrates--atrial np , b-type np , c-type np , and ventricular np --and structurally, cnp lacks the c-terminal tail, whereas other nps have both tails  <cit> . all of the snake venom nps seem to have originated from a common ancestral venom, cnp, and a complete snake cnp pro-peptide is constituted by a signal peptide, a linker, a flexible n-terminal extension , and a mature peptide . nevertheless, snake nps have recruited some new segments, such as several bradykinin-potentiating peptides , located in the np precursor in the viperidae family, whereas an alterable c-terminal extension was acquired in the elapidae family, which may result in novel physiological actions  <cit> .

here, we detected one contig  only in b. multicinctus, and this transcript had a region containing two tandem cnp- <dig> repeats. we noticed that this pair of tandem duplicates had different putative mature peptides  but had almost identical n-terminal extensions  , with statistically significant region-biased mutations  by fisher's exact test, which may represent a functional differentiation between the two nps. two possible evolutionary scenarios can explain this pattern: a) this is an old duplicate event, but the n-terminal extensions have a recent conversion or may be under strong functional constraint; and b) this is a young duplicate event, and the putative mature peptides evolved very fast. however, based on the alignment of np sequences in elapidae venoms , we noticed that bm <dig> and another unusual np  had a common repeated region  <cit> . we also found that the closest sequence of bm <dig> was the dnp in green mamba snake , which has attracted attention abroad for its novel long c-terminal extension  <cit> , and figure 3b shows that the c-terminal extension of dnp is homologous with the common repeated region. based on these clues, we propose that the duplicate event may have occurred in the ancestor of bungarus, dendroaspis, and micrurus.

 bm <dig>  the np precursor in b. multicinctus , is aligned to other elapid np sequences. a repeated region is shown between dashed bars, and the predicted regions of signal peptide and core ring are indicated above the alignment.

other toxins
in the cdna libraries, except for the major multigene toxin families, there were some other toxins that were widely found in snake venoms but that only constituted a small part of the total ests in a species. most of these toxins had been recruited into the venom system before the last common ancestor of elapid and viperid snakes with assistant toxic functions or unknown functions, such as crisp, ngf, lao, cystatin, and acetylcholinesterase  <cit> . besides, vespryn  and prothrombin activator  were only found in that elapid species so far  <cit> .

in this study, we obtained many full or partial novel sequences of these less abundant toxins: one cluster in b. multicinctus and three clusters in n. atra coding for crisp, one cluster in b. multicinctus and one cluster in n. atra coding for ngf, one cluster in b. multicinctus and one cluster in n. atra coding for lao, three clusters in b. multicinctus and one cluster in n. atra coding for vespryn, one cluster coding for cystatin, and one cluster coding for acetylcholinesterase in n. atra.

comparison of the major venom components among elapid snakes
previously several other transcriptomes of the elapid venom gland had been reported, such as marine snakes , australian snake , and coral snake   <cit> . however, besides 3ftxs, pla <dig> is also another major venom component in these species. we also noticed that the major types, 3ftxs, are very different. the major 3ftx types from the marine and australian snakes are long chain α-ntx and short chain α-ntx, whereas micrurus corallines mainly contains orphan gourp xii and some unknown groups of 3ftxs. in contrast, the major components of b. multicinctus venom transcriptome are 3ftxs  and recently originated β bungarotoxin while the n. atra venom transcriptome mainly contains cytotoxin and short chain α-ntx groups of 3ftx. other less abundant toxins were not observed in the transcriptomes of the marine and australian snakes, maybe due to the small number of sequenced clones.

besides transcripts, some studies also described peptide sequences for some elapid snake toxins. a study characterizing venom proteins of n. atra identified  <dig> protein segments or peptides  <cit> , 74% of which belonged to 3ftxs and 11% were pla <dig>  in another study of naja kaouthia venom proteomics  <cit> ,  <dig> venom proteins segments or peptides were identified, most of which were covered by our est sequence, except the cobra venom factors. two studies on coral snakes identified  <dig> and  <dig> toxin proteins or peptides, respectively  <cit> , 3ftx and pla <dig> proteins were also the major toxin components. so, the major toxins are basically consistent with our results observed in the n. atra venom gland transcriptome while bungarus has quite different components. however, it seems the pla <dig> transcripts have higher expression efficiency, considering that the pla <dig> ests only comprise  <dig> % of our toxin ests in n. atra while pla <dig> peptides were observed to compose of a considerable amount in the n. atra venom  <cit> .

analyses on the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates  for the protein-coding ests of all toxin genes
it has been known that the 3ftx and pla <dig> toxin multigene families have been subjected to positive darwinian selection  <cit> , but whether this has happened in the less abundant toxins is still unknown. we used the maximum likelihood model to estimate the dn/ds ratios of all kinds of toxins in elapid snake venoms. the representative sequences used here were from our est data or downloaded from the genbank database . except for orphan group ii of 3ftxs in b. multicinctus, almost all of the toxins had some sites that showed evidence of positive selection dn/ds ratios, and the dn/ds ratios for these sites ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . these results suggest that most toxin genes in elapid venoms might have been subjected to strong pressure of prey species shifts or arsenal competition, leading to the accelerated innovation of antigenic epitopes in toxins.

bac library construction and sequencing of 3ftx genes
in order to understand the gene structure of toxin genes, two independent bac libraries containing  <dig>   and  <dig>   clones, with average inserted genomic segments of  <dig> and  <dig> kb respectively, were constructed and arrayed into 384-well microtiter plates. examples of  <dig> digested clones are presented in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  we estimated that the percentage of clones without inserts was about 10%. based on the snake's haploid genome size of  <dig>  pg for bungarus fasciatus and  <dig>  pg for naja haje  <cit> , we estimated the genome coverage of the libraries to be around  <dig>  × for b. multicinctus and  <dig>  × for n. atra. these coverages theoretically provide  <dig> % and  <dig> % probability of obtaining any unique sequence in the b. multicinctus and n. atra bac libraries, respectively, assuming random cloning  <cit> .

we used 3ftx, pla <dig>  kunitz, or np toxin probes to screen the two bac libraries and identified  <dig> positive bac clones for b. multicinctus and  <dig> for n. atra. the screening results are listed in table  <dig>  unfortunately, we did not find positive pla <dig> clones for n. atra. in addition, we identified positive np bac clones in n. atra, but we did not observe ests from its cdna library.

in order to understand evolution patterns in the 3ftx super-family, we tried to subclone and sequence the 3ftx toxin genes. there were  <dig> bac clones showing 3ftx-probe positivity in this study. as the major toxin in elapid venoms, the structure and organization of 3ftx toxin genes have clearly been found to consist of three exons and two introns in a region of about  <dig>  kb  <cit> . based on the results of ecor i digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis separation, most of the  <dig> bac clones had multiple 3ftx toxin gene fragments, whose sizes were from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb . considering that the 3ftx toxin genes are about  <dig>  kb long and seldom contain ecor i sites, these multiple 3ftx toxin gene fragments, located in the same bac clone, are very likely to be tandem duplicates.

excluding some redundant bac clones with the same 3ftx toxin gene restriction fragments, we obtained  <dig> rflp-unique 3ftx toxin bac clones, indicating there are at least  <dig> and  <dig> segmental duplicate areas of 3ftx toxin genes, respectively, in b. multicinctus and n. atra. because of the existence of tandem duplicates, it is hard to sequence these clones. finally, we got  <dig> and  <dig> complete or partial 3ftx toxin gene sequences by constructing subcloning libraries and genomic walking, respectively, for b. multicinctus and n. atra. the 3ftx toxin gene sequences that were derived from the same bac clone were defined as putative tandem duplicates. there are  <dig> putative tandem duplicates in b. multicinctus and  <dig> in n. atra. the nucleotide substitution rate per site  in the non-coding regions  between the tandem duplicates is shown in table  <dig>  we noticed that most of the potential tandem duplicates had low kn values , indicating that most duplication events happened recently. it also suggests that fast 3ftx gene expansion is still ongoing in the two elapids.

based on the best blast hits to the genbank database and our est data, all of the 3ftx toxin genes were classified and annotated . about 65%  of the gene sequences showed lower than 95% identity with 3ftx toxin gene sequences from the genbank database, indicating that most of the 3ftx toxin genes that we sequenced are novel sequences . parts of the 3ftx genes that we sequenced, especially a big group that looked similar to orphan group ii, could not match any ests from the two cdna libraries, indicating that a large number of lower-expression 3ftx toxin genes were not detected in previous studies.

because the coding sequences of 3ftx genes are short and too diversified, it is difficult to construct an accurate phylogenetic relationship for all these diverse subgroups of 3ftx. so, we tried to use only the intron sequences for genic phylogenetic analyses, especially using intron ii, which has a stable length of about  <dig> bp  <cit> . but, the 3ftx gene tree  still confuses us with multiple radiated sub-families, just like the phylogenetic relationship of the 3ftx constructed by fry  <cit> . taking α-ntx for example, we observed two monophyletic lineages of short chain α-ntx from n. atra and two monophyletic lineages of long chain α-ntx, respectively, from b. multicinctus and n. atra, which indicates that multiple groups of α-ntx separated before the divergence of bungarus and naja. considering that the long chain α-ntx originated mainly by one splicing site shifting event from short chain α-ntx  <cit>  and that both the short and long chain α-ntx coexist in some australian and marine snakes, such as austrelaps labialis  <cit> , lapemis curtus  <cit> , and laticauda semifasciata  <cit> , the hypotheses that α-ntx diverged from a common ancestor seems reasonable. so, it is very likely that these broad radiated groups of 3ftx  appeared right before the explosive speciation of major elapid subfamilies in the mid-oligocene  <cit> . in brief, our data suggest that 3ftx genes probably experienced family explosion and thereby generated the major groups before the species radiation of elapidae subfamilies. after that, by massive duplication, perhaps mainly by tandem duplication, the 3ftx gene family acquired numerous new members and became the most abundant toxin family in the two elapid venoms.

CONCLUSIONS
both b. multicinctus and n. atra venoms are very toxic, respectively, with ld <dig> of  <dig>  mg/kg and  <dig>  mg/kg when injected subcutaneously , and they belong to two closely related genera  <cit> . however, the major components of the b. multicinctus venom transcriptome are neurotoxins, including long chain α-ntx and β bungarotoxin, whereas the n. atra venom transcriptome mainly has cytotoxicity and a little bit of neurotoxicity from short chain α-ntx. in this study, we present the toxin profiles of b. multicinctus and n. atra by sequencing their venom gland transcriptomes. then, the bac libraries for these two elapids were constructed, and  <dig> bacs containing 3ftx genes were partially sequenced. the data revealed that tandem duplications contributed the majority of the expansions of toxin multigene families in the two elapids. we detected positive selection in every toxin subfamily and found that not only the multigene toxin families but also the less abundant toxins were under rapid adaptive evolution.
