BACKGROUND
the functions of a considerable percentage of the proteins encoded by the sequenced genomes of many organisms including human, mouse, arabidopsis, and rice are not clear. the immediate task of post-genomic biology is to determine the biological functions of proteins coded for by these genes. many endogenous proteins occur in extremely low abundance but recombinant protein can be used as alternative sources to endogenous proteins for studying protein structure and function  <cit> , for making high-titer antibodies  <cit> , and for producing pharmaceutical reagents. however, a great number of proteins are difficult to express due to protein insolubility, protein degradation, and low-level protein expression  <cit> . therefore, production of high quality recombinant protein requires optimization of protein expression and purification procedures.

diacylglycerol acyltransferases  are responsible for the last and rate-limiting step of triacylglycerol  biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. dgat genes have been isolated from many organisms  <cit> . at least two forms of dgats are present in mammals  <cit>  and plants  <cit>  with additional forms reported in burning bush   <cit>  and peanut  <cit> . dgat isoforms have nonredundant functions in tag biosynthesis in plants such as tung tree   <cit>  and animals such as mice  <cit> . tung tree genome has two well-known dgat isoforms  which are targeted to distinct subdomains of the er membrane, and likely carry out different roles in seed lipid metabolism  <cit> . mice deficient in dgat <dig> are viable, have modest decreases in tag, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity  <cit> . mice deficient in dgat <dig> have severe reduction of tag and die shortly after birth  <cit> . the fact that dgat <dig> is unable to compensate for the deficiency in dgat <dig> knockout mice indicates that each dgat isoform has unique functions in tag biosynthesis during mammal development.

database search has identified at least  <dig> dgat <dig> sequences from  <dig> organisms . however, there is a gap of knowledge between the gene sequences and the proteins coded for by the dgat genes  <cit> . although dgat expression was reported in several studies, only limited success has been achieved due to the facts that dgats are integral membrane proteins  <cit>  and are difficult to express and purify using heterologous hosts  <cit> . information regarding the expression of dgat <dig> gene in e. coli is limited. the amino terminal  <dig> amino acid residues of oilseed rape  dgat <dig> was expressed as a his-tag protein in e. coli  <cit> . similar studies reported on the production of the amino terminal  <dig> residues of mouse dgat <dig> in e. coli  <cit> . however, the expression of dgat <dig> as a full-length protein in e. coli had not been reported. the objective of this study was to develop a reliable procedure for the expression of a full-length dgat <dig> in e. coli using tung tree dgat <dig>  as the model protein.

RESULTS
construction of bacterial expression plasmid
plasmid pmbp-dgat1-his was engineered to express the full-length vernicia fordii  dgat <dig> in an e. coli protein expression system. the recombinant protein mbp-dgat1-his  contained a mbp  at the amino terminus and  <dig> histidine residues  at the carboxyl terminus . a prescission protease cleavage site was engineered between the mbp and dgat <dig> fusion partners. the "methods" section describes the details of the plasmid construction.

degradation of recombinant dgat <dig> in the soluble fraction of e. coli
the expression of rdgat <dig> was induced by iptg in e. coli strain bl <dig> and detected by immunoblotting using anti-mbp-http and anti-mbp-mttp polyclonal antibodies, which were raised in rabbits against purified recombinant human and mouse ttp proteins fused to mbp  <cit> . these antibodies have been shown to react with mbp and mbp fusion proteins with high specificity  <cit> .

anti-mbp-mttp antibodies detected a number of bands ranging from approximately  <dig> kda  to  <dig> kda and a trace amount of protein corresponding to the full-size rdgat <dig>  . there was no significant difference in protein expression levels among different starting colonies of the bacterium. the expression levels, judged from the overall full-length and degradation products, were decreased under longer expression time tested . less but similar sizes of the full-length and degradation products were detected in the cells without iptg induction , indicating a high basal level expression of the recombinant protein under uninduced conditions. the  <dig> kda band corresponds to protein smaller than the 80-kda-sized mbp-mttp fusion protein . recombinant dgat <dig> expression was not significantly different when protein expression was induced at 25°c or 37°c, nor under culture medium with or without  <dig> % glucose . similar results were obtained using anti-mbp-http antibodies and the commercial anti-mbp antibodies . in agreement with the immunoblotting results shown in figure 3a, a protein staining gel showed that no distinct band with a molecular mass corresponding to the full-length rdgat <dig> was observed in the  <dig> g supernatant from the uninduced and iptg-induced cells .

as a control experiment, plasmid pmal-c2x vector was transformed into the same type of e. coli. like rdgat <dig> expression in the uninduced cells described above, mbp protein was clearly produced in the uninduced cells . in contrast to the minimal expression of rdgat <dig> in e. coli , mbp was massively induced by iptg in the same type of cells , which was specifically recognized by the commercial anti-mbp antibodies  <cit>  and the same anti-mbp-http antibodies  <cit>  and anti-mbp-mttp antibodies  <cit>  used in the current study. these results suggest that rdgat <dig> was expressed well but was extensively degraded in e. coli under the experimental conditions.

localization of recombinant dgat <dig> in the insoluble fraction and membranes of e. coli
amylose resin affinity chromatography was used to identify the trace amount of the full-length protein as rdgat <dig> shown in figure  <dig>  based on the expression studies described above, dgat <dig> fusion protein expression in e. coli was scaled up. the  <dig> g supernatant was applied onto an mbptrap hp column. after extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with  <dig> mm maltose. however, no clear protein peak was eluted with maltose as judged from uv absorbance at  <dig> nm . immunoblotting confirmed that the great majority if not all of the immuno-reactive proteins did not bind to amylose resin and was enriched in the unbound fractions .

to investigate if the recombinant protein was in the insoluble fraction, the  <dig> g pellet was sonicated extensively in the same homogenization buffer. this supernatant was used for mbptrap column purification. the great majority of the "released" recombinant dgat <dig> did not bind to the column  and was mainly recovered in the unbound fractions . however, immunoblotting showed that the full-length rdgat <dig> was much more enriched in the pellet than in the soluble fraction of e. coli and some full-length protein was eluted from the column .

to localize the trace amount of the recombinant protein in the supernatant shown in panel a, the  <dig> g supernatant was centrifuged at  <dig> g. immunoblotting showed that rdgat <dig> was mainly associated with the membrane fraction and only a smaller fraction of rdgat <dig> in the cytosol .

purification of recombinant dgat <dig> with ni-nta affinity chromatography
ni-nta beads were used to test the purification of the recombinant protein using the  <dig> g supernatant. the bound proteins were eluted with successively increasing imidazole concentrations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> mm. sds-page showed that the purified fractions contained a number of proteins as shown by coomassie blue staining . the majority of the bound recombinant protein  was eluted with 200- <dig> mm imidazole in the elution buffer and no recombinant protein was detected in the washes . rdgat <dig> only partially bound to ni-nta beads because a significant amount of the full-length rdgat <dig> was recovered in the unbound fraction . as expected, mbp and most of the degradation products were not bound to the ni-nta beads because the immunoreactive bands on the blot corresponded to the full-length rdgat <dig> . a protein band with approximately twice the size  of the full-length rdgat <dig> was seen in the eluted fractions on the immunoblot after sds-denatured gel separation . a similar immunoreactive band with the higher molecular mass was also observed on other immunoblots .

purification of recombinant dgat <dig> with tandem ni-nta and amylose resin affinity chromatography
the proteins eluted by  <dig> mm imidazole from ni-nta affinity beads  were pooled and centrifuged at  <dig> g. the supernatant was loaded onto an amylose resin affinity column. fplc chromatogram showed that the great majority of proteins were washed off the column and little protein was bound to the mbptrap column , similar to those observed using the  <dig> g supernatant . coomassie blue staining showed that the additional affinity purification step did not improve the purity . immunoblotting showed that part of the recombinant protein was precipitated  and rdgat <dig> was detected in the unbound fractions  but undetectable in the eluted fractions .

sds solubilization and purification of recombinant dgat <dig> from insoluble fraction
immunoblotting showed that the great majority of rdgat <dig> was recovered in the  <dig> g pellet . therefore, sds was used to solubilize rdgat <dig> from  <dig> g as well as the  <dig>  g pellet fractions followed by purification with ni-nta affinity chromatography. immunoblotting showed that full-length rdgat <dig> was barely detectable in the  <dig>  g supernatant and the wash . some full-length rdgat <dig> and several degraded protein bands were detected in the unbound fraction and the major protein band was detected in the eluted fraction . the full-length rdgat <dig> was stable in cells under iptg induction for 2- <dig> h as demonstrated in the purified fractions from the sds-solubilized pellet .

detergent and urea solubilization and purification of recombinant dgat <dig> from insoluble fraction
as the results indicated that rdgat <dig> was associated with the insoluble pellet, an attempt was made to solubilize the recombinant protein from the  <dig> g pellet with seven different detergents  and urea followed by purification with ni-nta affinity chromatography. immunoblotting showed that sds was the most effective detergent for rdgat <dig> solubilization, while only small amounts of the full-length rdgat <dig> was detected in the solubilized fractions by other detergents . the optimal concentrations for sds solubilization were  <dig> -1% . ni-nta affinity purification showed that solubilization by both sds and triton x- <dig> resulted in the highest yields of full-length rdgat <dig> . therefore, various concentrations of triton x- <dig> were tested for the solubilization of rdgat <dig> from the pellet. immunoblotting showed that  <dig> -1% triton x- <dig> were the optimal concentrations for the extraction  and purification . urea at  <dig> m and  <dig> m also solubilized the fusion protein to a significant level . however, ni-nta affinity chromatography indicated that rdgat <dig> from urea-solubilized samples bound to the affinity beads poorly because much less of the full-length protein was obtained in the urea-solubilized protein solution . silver staining of the purified fractions indicated multiple proteins co-purified with the recombinant protein . extensive efforts were directed to purify rdgat <dig> from the ni-nta purified proteins following sds and triton x <dig> solubilization. however, the protein could not be purified to near homogeneity by amylose resin affinity, superose  <dig> size exclusion, and mono q anion exchange chromatography .

prescission protease digestion of recombinant dgat1
immunoblotting results showed that mbp-ttp antibodies detected multiple protein bands from soluble fraction , insoluble fraction , membrane fraction , ni-nta and amylose resin affinity-purified fractions , and detergent- and urea-solubilized fractions . to confirm the identity of the full-length rdgat <dig>  prescission protease digestion was performed using rdgat <dig> purified by ni-nta affinity chromatography  because a prescission protease cleavage site was engineered between mbp and dgat <dig> fusion partners . the rdgat <dig> sample was digested by the protease overnight followed by centrifugation at  <dig> g. immunoblotting showed that a protein band with the size of mbp was detected in the soluble fraction but not in the undigested protein sample . it also showed that the great majority of rdgat <dig> was recovered in the pellet following digestion . these results confirmed the identity of rdgat <dig> and showed extensive precipitation of rdgat <dig> following purification.

discussion
diacylglycerol acyltransferase families  catalyze the final and rate-limiting step of triacylglycerol  biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. understanding the roles of dgats will help to create transgenic plants with value-added properties and provide information for therapeutic intervention for obesity and related diseases. database search has identified at least  <dig> dgat <dig> sequences from  <dig> organisms , but the expression of any dgat <dig> as a full-length protein in e. coli had not been reported. here a procedure was described for expressing recombinant full-length dgat <dig> in a bacterial expression system. the hydrophilic amino termini of dgat <dig> from mouse and oilseed rape had previously been expressed as his-tagged fusion proteins in e. coli  <cit> . however, the full-length dgat <dig> was not expressed in e. coli previously because it is an integral membrane protein with  <dig> putative membrane-spinning domains using topology modeling  <cit> , although mice dgat <dig> has only three transmembrane domains using protease protections assays and indirect immunofluorescence in conjunction with selective permeabilization of cellular membranes  <cit> . in this study, the full-length dgat <dig> was fused to mbp at the amino terminus and his-tag at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. the full-length dgat <dig> was successfully expressed in e. coli and it is possible that the fusion to mbp contributed to the results, as mbp has been shown to increase the solubility of target proteins such as human and mouse ttp  <cit> .

purification of recombinant dgats from any source represents a challenge. only a few studies in e. coli have been directly related to the purification of recombinant dgats  <cit> . expression of soluble peanut dgat  in e. coli resulted in high levels of dgat activity and the formation of labeled tag  <cit> . the recombinant n-terminal region of brassica napus dgat <dig> his6) was purified from e. coli with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  da, which was confirmed by maldi-tof mass spectrometry; however, the apparent molecular mass on sds-page was doubled and the native size was four times of the size of the monomer due to self-association. full-length dgat <dig> was not successfully expressed in e. coli  <cit> . in the study herein, we engineered double affinity tags for facilitating purification of recombinant dgat <dig> from e. coli. recombinant dgat <dig> was only partially purified from the extract by either type of affinity beads or both kinds of beads, probably due to extensive precipitation . preliminary attempts to measure the activity of rdgat <dig> using cold oleoyl-coa and sn- <dig> -diolein did not result in visible tga spot on tlc plates , probably due to the low sensitivity of cold substrate. further experiments are required to demonstrate the biological activity of rdgat <dig> using radioactive oleoyl-coa. our current data, together with the various published reports cited here, underline the tremendous challenges that exist for the purification of recombinant full-length dgat proteins.

several lines of evidence support the assignment of the full-length rdgat <dig> on various immunoblots despite the facts that mbp-ttp antibodies detected multiple protein bands from soluble fraction, insoluble fraction, membrane fraction, ni-nta and amylose resin affinity-purified fractions, and detergent- and urea-solubilized fractions. first, mbp-ttp antibodies have been well-characterized in a number of previous publications which cross-react specifically with both mbp and ttp  <cit> . second, the detection of mbp by anti-mbp-ttp antibodies  <cit>  is identical to the commercial anti-mbp antibodies  <cit> . third, the size of the full-length rdgat <dig> on immunoblots corresponded to the calculated size of the protein. fourth, affinity purification with ni-nta beads based on the his-tag at the carboxyl terminus of rdgat <dig> resulted in the full-length rdgat <dig> being the most predominant band on the immunoblots . these results also suggest that the multiple lower molecular mass bands on immunoblots are degradation products from the carboxyl terminus of rdgat <dig> because they were detected in amylose resin affinity-purified protein samples  but not if any in ni-nta affinity-purified protein samples . finally, the full-length rdgat <dig> was partially digested by prescission protease resulting in the release of mbp in the soluble fraction .

during the purification process, we observed several lines of evidence that suggest rdgat <dig> is directly or indirectly associated with other proteins, lipids, and plasma membranes. first, rdgat <dig> is associated with e. coli plasma membranes, because the majority of dgat <dig> fusion protein was detected in the  <dig> g plasma membranes instead of the  <dig> g cytosol . second, the partially purified proteins eluted from affinity beads contained multiple proteins even after extensive washes . finally, the purified protein samples appeared yellow in color. gas chromatography confirmed that ni-nta purified rdgat <dig> fraction contained fatty acids . these observations are in agreement with several previous reports showing that dgat is associated with lipids or lipid bodies  <cit> , lipid droplets of cultured mouse adipocytes   <cit>  and er membranes  <cit> . as a positive control for the expression and purification experiments, the mbp fusion partner was massively induced by iptg in the same type of e. coli and purified from the soluble fraction to near homogeneity by a single step of amylose resin affinity chromatography. therefore, the direct or indirect association of rdgat <dig> with other proteins, lipids, and plasma membranes may explain why tandem affinity beads were not effective in the purification of rdgat <dig> to homogeneity.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study reports the first procedure for expressing the full-length recombinant dgat <dig> from any species using a bacterial expression system. the results suggest that recombinant dgat <dig> is extensively degraded from the carboxyl terminus and is directly or indirectly associated with other proteins, lipids, and membranes. although the protein was not purified to homogeneity in the current study, the ability to express full-length dgat <dig> in e. coli could provide the basis for future purification of the protein.
