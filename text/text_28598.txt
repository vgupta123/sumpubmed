BACKGROUND
mastitis is defined as an inflammation of the udder, mainly caused by an infection by various bacterial species. amongst infectious diseases, intramammary infections  are of major importance in dairy ruminants because of their high frequency and the increased production costs that they incur . the most prevalent etiological group causing mastitis in sheep is staphylococcus with  <dig> % of positive cultures  <cit> . coagulase-negative staphylococci  are particularly frequent and represent  <dig> % of all isolates, most of which are s. epidermidis   <cit> . cns are considered to be minor pathogens, causing moderate inflammatory responses and often subclinical infections in dairy ruminants  <cit> . on the contrary, coagulase-positive staphylococci , largely represented by s. aureus , are major pathogens in all dairy species. they are principally associated with both chronic and clinical forms of mastitis  <cit> , some of which can be very severe and in the worst case lead to a high mortality rate.

although much work has been carried out in dairy ruminants to understand the complex physiological and cellular events that occur in the mammary gland in response to pathogens  <cit> , the protective mechanisms are still obscure. schematically, when pathogens enter the udder lumen via the teat canal, they are detected by both immune and non-immune cells, and this is followed by the release of chemoattractants. as a consequence, neutrophils migrate from the blood flow to the infection site  <cit> . these cells can phagocyte bacteria and exert bactericidal activities by releasing potent oxidative products  <cit> . this massive recruitment of neutrophils in the udder incurs a dramatic increase in the milk somatic cell count   <cit> . accordingly, scc has been widely advocated as an easy-to-measure tool for predicting mastitis and discriminating between chronically infected and non-infected animals  <cit> . recent advances in microarray technology, that nowadays enable the expression analysis of thousands of infection-related genes, have provided novel insights into host response to pathogens. microarray analysis is a well-adapted technology to investigate the gene regulation mechanisms underlying immunity against pathogens. previously, gene expression profiles for challenged mammary tissue  <cit> , milk cells  <cit>  and peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit>  have been studied using microarrays.

there is overwhelming evidence that the host's response to imi is under genetic control, as extensively described in earlier studies  <cit> . genetic parameters have been established for milk somatic cell scores  and occurrence of clinical mastitis, thus indicating that five to twenty percent of all variability between individuals is of genetic origin. additionally, numerous quantitative trait loci  for udder health traits have been identified  <cit> . however, up to date, only one of these qtl - the forebrain embryonic zinc finger-like gene -has been fully characterised  <cit> . apart from this qtl, the genetic basis of resistance is still largely unknown.

nevertheless, breeding programmes for mastitis resistance have been implemented throughout the world in dairy cattle  <cit>  and sheep  <cit>  using indirect predictor traits such as clinical mastitis and scs. to assess the effect of scs-based selection for resistance or susceptibility to imi, two divergent lines of dairy sheep were created on the basis of their parents' breeding values for scs  <cit> . evaluation of the frequency and duration of mastitis in the two lines demonstrated that selection for decreased scs is associated with a decrease of imi  <cit> .

in the present study, we performed transcriptomic analysis of milk somatic cells , collected from mastitis resistant and susceptible ewes using a generic 15k oligonucleotide chip. msc were collected after challenge with se and sa during the first and second lactations respectively. our objective was to use this animal-model of divergent-scs-lines in order to identify some of the genes and molecular mechanisms involved in the genetic basis of the protective host response to staphylococcal imi.

RESULTS
experimental challenges
clinical examination of the mammary gland, bacteriological analyses and scc confirmed that all animals were free from udder infections before challenges.

at the beginning of the first infection with se, the scs increased rapidly in the inoculated half udder . it then increased at a slower rate after the second infection with sa in the contra-lateral half udder . consequently, the scs were higher upon se than upon sa challenge at  <dig> hours , although the contrary was observed at  <dig> hours . bacteriological titres  were significantly higher after sa challenge than after se challenge over the period from  <dig> to  <dig> hours .

no significant differences were observed for milk scs between the resistant and susceptible lines, either before or after the two successive challenges.

by contrast, the bacteriological titres were significantly higher in the susceptible line than in the resistant line over the period from  <dig> to  <dig> hours upon sa challenge . although it was not significant, the bacteriological titre was also higher at  <dig> hours upon se challenge in the susceptible line when compared to the resistant line . these results suggest that bacterial clearance is more efficient in the resistant than in the susceptible line.

furthermore, a difference in cell viability between challenges was observed in the milk cells collected by cisternal lavage  <dig> hours after challenge, with respectively  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and 55% ±  <dig>  of viable cells in se and sa challenges . notably, the proportion of lymphocytes was higher after sa than after se infection  as illustrated in figure  <dig> for one representative ewe. despite the differences observed between the challenges, the profile of cell types was not significantly different between the two divergent lines, except for monocytes/macrophages whose proportion tended to be higher in susceptible animals .

comparison of the host response to s. aureus and s. epidermidis challenges
microarray analysis and biological interpretation
the functional roles of msc in response to different staphylococcus spp were explored through gene expression profiling in the divergent sheep lines successively infected with se during the first lactation, and sa during the second lactation. the multifactorial anova applied probe by probe identified  <dig>  probes as differentially expressed according to the challenge effect  >  <dig> ; the fc is the ratio between sa and se challenges). among these,  <dig> probes had an afc >  <dig> . the de probe list enabled a perfect segregation between animals challenged by se and sa as shown by the hierarchical clustering in figure  <dig>  this probe list corresponded to  <dig> annotated genes with  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were more expressed in sa and se infections, respectively. the main functions of the genes expressed at a higher level in sa than in se infections were associated with the immune response: hematopoiesis , cell-mediated immune response , cell death , immunological disease  and inflammatory response . genes whose expression was higher after se challenge were linked to cellular growth and proliferation , infectious disease , lipid metabolism , molecular transport  and small molecule biochemistry  .

network analysis with ipa produced two networks. in the first network , which is characterised by cell-to-cell signalling and interaction and cell-mediated immune response, the t cell receptor signalling pathway  and the major histocompatibility complex - mhc - pathway , dqa <dig> , dra, drb <dig>  and drb3) are highly represented. in a second network, defined by inflammatory disease and response and haematological disease, both the il <dig> receptor pathway and the tnf pathway are well represented with il1r <dig>  il1rap and irak <dig>  and traf2-3- <dig> respectively .

real-time qpcr validation of the differentially-expressed genes between sa and se challenges
real-time qpcr was used to confirm the gene expression differences between the two challenges. the most expressed gene in se challenges was cpb <dig>  we also examined the differential expression of chemokine  receptor  <dig>  and interleukine  <dig> receptor type ii  for their role in pathogen detection, as well as myxovirus resistance  <dig>  and granzyme h  for their role in immune response. hence, five genes were selected, three of which were more expressed in the sa condition  and two in the se condition . chemokine  ligand  <dig>  was added to this gene list since it is known to induce t cell recruitment in inflamed tissue, and because it had been discarded from the microarray analysis due to missing data . the differential expression between the two challenges was significantly  confirmed for five out of the six genes . among those genes, the expression of cxcl <dig> was 60-fold higher in sa than in se challenges. although not significant , the expression of gzmh was higher in the sa than the se condition .

the results represent the mean ± standard deviation of the relative expression in qpcr of six differentially expressed genes identified in the microarray analyses between se and sa challenges. a non parametric wilcoxon test was performed with sas to identify the differentially expressed genes.

*** p-value <  <dig> ; ** p-value <  <dig> .

comparison of gene expression profiles between mastitis resistant and susceptible lines
microarray analysis
using a multifactorial anova model applied probe by probe,  <dig> probes were shown to be significantly de between the resistant and susceptible lines  . these probes corresponded to  <dig> annotated genes, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes expressed at a higher level in the resistant and susceptible line, respectively. this list of  <dig> genes is further named as the "main list". out of the  <dig> genes with higher expression in the resistant line, eight had a fc ≥  <dig> . only three out of the  <dig> genes that were expressed at a higher level in the susceptible line had an afc >  <dig> .

 <dig> in the fold-change, the enumerator is the resistant line and the denominator is the susceptible line.

anova models with line and challenge effects were applied probe by probe with genespring® .

as the gene expression of msc response differs between challenges with two different staphylococcus species, the line effect was also analysed independently within each challenge. the lesser amount of data in separate analyses made it necessary to loosen the significance threshold to find differentially expressed genes within se or sa challenges. accordingly, a total of  <dig> probes  was considered to be de between the lines after se challenge and  <dig> probes  after sa challenge  . the latter two lists were compared to each other and also to the main list  by generating a venn diagram . nine genes  and also loc <dig> and an unannotated probe were common to the three lists. forty other genes belonged to the main list and one of the two single-challenge lists .

to gain further insight into the biological signification of the differences between the resistant and susceptible lines, information from the separate analyses in sa an se was added to the main list. the three probe lists were pooled together , resulting in a super-list of  <dig> annotated genes . in this list, further named as the "pooled list",  <dig> and  <dig> genes were expressed at a higher level in the resistant and the susceptible animals, respectively.

real-time qpcr validation of the differentially-expressed genes between resistant and susceptible lines
to confirm the line effect, seventeen genes were analysed by qpcr. genes were chosen because they belonged to the main list , or had been identified in sa  or se conditions  . real-time qpcr confirmed the significant  differential expression of eight genes . six others  were close to signification . the genes tlr <dig>  eif4ebp <dig> and mapre <dig> were not significantly confirmed by qpcr , however the relative gene expression between resistant and susceptible was in accordance with microarray analysis .

the results represent the mean ± standard deviation of the relative expression in qpcr of seventeen differentially expressed genes identified in the microarray analyses with all data , s. aureus  or s. epidermidis data . qpcr were performed with sa or se samples or with both sa an se samples . a non parametric wilcoxon test was performed with sas to identify the differentially expressed genes. ** p-value <  <dig> ; * p-value <  <dig> .

clustering of the differentially expressed genes between the resistant and susceptible lines
principal component analysis  of the probes from the pooled list revealed that the first two principal components, that represented 19% of the total variations, could separate the sheep samples into three clusters: resistant animals infected by sa, susceptible animals infected by sa and animals infected by se . the principal component  <dig>  explained  <dig> % of the total variations and clearly discriminated the staphylococcus spp within the differentially expressed genes between the lines . the gene expression of capn <dig> was mainly associated with se challenge whereas the gene expression of ccl <dig> and cd <dig> was linked to sa challenge . the pc <dig> explained  <dig> % of the total variations and generally tended to separate the resistant and susceptible animals whatever the challenge . gene expression of tp <dig>  tlr <dig>  map3k <dig>  selplg and bola-nc <dig> was associated with the resistant animals whereas gene expression of plekhb <dig>  tmem87b and csf <dig> was linked to the susceptible ones .

go and pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes between resistant and susceptible lines
additional biological information was obtained using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  with human ortholog gene names - hugo nomenclature . first, gene ontology  analysis of the biological process terms was performed. the up-regulated genes in the resistant line showed a significant enrichment of leukocyte adhesion and activation, cell death regulation, intracellular signalling cascades and negative regulation of macromolecule metabolic processes and catalytic activities . on the contrary, the down-regulated genes showed a significant enrichment in positive regulation of inflammatory response  . both up and down-regulated genes showed an over-representation of genes involved in the regulation of transcription and rna maturation and in cell motion .

two biocarta pathways were well-represented: apoptotic signalling in response to dna damage , and adhesion and diapedesis of granulocytes . four kegg pathways were also identified: lysosome , adipocytokine signalling pathway , hematopoietic cell lineage  and focal adhesion .

gene network analysis of the differentially expressed genes between resistant and susceptible lines
systemic identification and grouping of line-associated genes into biological networks was performed with ipa using hugo names . five networks were obtained with a score superior to  <dig>  twenty-two to twenty-eight genes were involved in each network. the two first networks are presented in the figure  <dig>  network  <dig> is characterised by lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry . it presents tp <dig>  the second most up-regulated gene in the resistant line , as a hub which means that tp <dig> regulates or is regulated by a large proportion of the identified de genes . network  <dig> is defined by cellular movement, haematological system development and function, and immune cell trafficking . it highlights a central position for tlr <dig>  linked to cd <dig>  that are of major importance for pathogen recognition. other genes were included in this network eif4ebp <dig> and itga <dig>  nfkb , ccl <dig>  and rarα and ahr involved in the retinoic acid pathway .

communal transcription factor analysis
to enhance the understanding of the genetic basis of the de genes, the potential transcription factors that can regulate these genes were investigated by looking for transcription factor-binding sites  that were over-represented in the promoter sequences of the de genes. using  <dig> genes recognised in innatedb, significant enrichment was demonstrated for  <dig> transcription factors with a p <  <dig>  , and nine other transcription factors with p <  <dig>  . furthermore, the transcription factors ahr, which showed lower expression levels in the resistant animals, and cebpa, which showed higher expression levels, could bind the promoters of thirty-three and seven genes, respectively, that were more expressed in the susceptible line . tp <dig>  which showed higher expression levels in the resistant animals, could bind fourteen up-regulated genes .

discussion
gene expression of milk somatic cells
in the present study, we compared the gene expression in msc upon mammary challenge. up to date, only a small number of studies have analysed the transcriptome of msc, by comparing infected and non-infected glands  <cit> . msc populations, however, are highly modified after infection: whereas mononuclear cells are preponderant in healthy glands  <cit> , neutrophils represent the main cell type in infected glands  <cit> . because of the profound modifications within the msc population, the comparison of msc gene expression before and after challenge should be interpreted with caution as they are the result of mixed molecular and cellular effects. hence, our study focused on the transcriptomic differences within homogeneous cell populations between the lines upon challenge. it is well known that the development of s. aureus in any tissue implies host cell apoptosis  <cit> , and so rna breakdown occurs. to circumvent the difficulty, cisternal lavage was performed after emptying the mammary gland to gather recently emigrated and living msc. this protocol enabled us to recover a higher proportion of living cells and obtain good quality rna, despite the short half-life of milk neutrophils.

physiological mechanisms that are mobilised during the early response are considered as determinant for the outcome of imi. therefore, we selected an early time point  for cell collection, during the first wave of cell recruitment, just before the bacteria titres diverge, and the side effects, on the mammary tissue due to bacteria growth, appear. in addition at  <dig> hours post inoculation, the milk cell population was much more homogeneous than at later time points, i.e. 95% of the cells were neutrophils. therefore, despite the small number of animals used and the fact that only one time point was considered, we identified lists of significant and biological relevant differentially expressed genes in msc. the results gave some insight into the differential response of the host to imi according to the mastitis causing pathogen and its genetic background.

differences between s. epidermidis and s. aureus challenges
although genetically sa and se are closely related  <cit> , the host cell viability after sa challenge was lower than after se challenge and the proportion of t-cells was higher. this is correlated with the striking differences in the gene expression profiles of infected msc at twelve hours post-inoculation. indeed,  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed in msc infected either by sa or se. the greatest absolute fold changes  were achieved when sa was compared to se - 91% of the genes with an afc >  <dig> were over-expressed after sa challenge. a high number of de genes underlined t cell recruitment after sa challenge. indeed, two major genes that are up-regulated after sa challenge are involved in t-cell responses: the chemokine  ligand  <dig>   <cit>  and the cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated protein  <dig> gene . the up-regulation of ctla <dig> in msc of cows with chronic sa mastitis has already been reported  <cit> . in addition, the components of the chemokine signalling and cell adhesion molecule pathways were over-represented after sa challenge. these pathways play important roles in blood neutrophil arrest and diapedesis across the endothelium  <cit> . furthermore, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions are also noticeable and cytokines are known to tightly regulate neutrophil functions during inflammatory response  <cit> . thus, pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway  in neutrophils and promote leukocyte recruitment to inflammation sites. furthermore, s. aureus exerted an oxidative priming and a pro-apoptotic effect on neutrophils, contrary to s. epidermidis strains  <cit> . s. aureus cytotoxicity mainly depends on proteases, hyaluronidases, lipases and nucleases that facilitate tissue destruction, membrane-damaging toxins that cause cytolytic effects in host cells, and superantigens that contribute to the symptoms of septic shock  <cit> . moreover, three sub-units of the major histocomptibility complex  class ii  were up-regulated after sa challenge suggesting recruitment of antigen-presenting cells or activation of t cells. the higher proportion of lymphocytes after sa challenge might be partly responsible for the large variations of gene expression observed between sa and se challenges.

altogether, the gene expression profiles of msc upon challenge with two distinct pathogens differed widely in relation with the severity of the mastitis, bacterial counts and milk scc  <cit> . furthermore, it should be noted that all the differences of msc gene expression infected either by sa or se might not be caused by the staphylococcus species. actually, other factors may explain these differences since the animals were infected twice, and a memory response could have developed consequently to the first challenge. however, this is improbable due to the recurrence of infections frequently reported in apparently susceptible animals and the poor effect of vaccination with living bacteria on the occurrence and severity of subsequent infections. the animals' physiological conditions  at the second lactation could also influence the pattern of response. so partial confusion with other effects not related to the bacterial strain cannot be totally excluded.

transcriptome differences associated with mastitis resistance or susceptibility
to our knowledge, this is the first report of a high-throughput gene expression profiling of msc from animals genetically selected for their resistance to mastitis. although, griesbeck-hilch et al.  <cit>  have already compared the expression of a few genes in mammary epithelial cells  of mastitis resistant and susceptible cows selected on the basis of the breeding values for scs or genetic markers. the genetic lines used in this study were created from a one-generation selection of lacaune dairy ewes based on their parents' breeding values for scs. the divergence achieved was high, i.e.  <dig> genetic standard deviations  <cit> , and was confirmed over successive cohorts raised in the same flock between  <dig> and  <dig> . the selection criterion used is the scc, it is based on few repeated measures  and is able to discriminate chronically infected animals from non-infected animals. scc-based selection, therefore, does not give any information about the underlying mechanisms selected, but previously published results have shown that such selection improves resistance to imi  <cit> .

in the present study, whereas milk scc were not significantly different between the lines in the early course of staphylococcus challenges, bacteria titres were lower in the resistant line than in the susceptible line. the difference between lines increased from  <dig> to  <dig> hours upon challenge. accordingly, differentially expressed genes in milk cells at twelve hours post-inoculation might provide useful information about the early mechanisms underlying the genetic control of mastitis in the resistant line, that portend differences of the mastitis issue that were later observed.

cytokines and chemokines
some soluble factors such as chemokines form gradients from the blood towards infected sites and can enhance neutrophil attraction and migration. in our study, we found no expression differences for major chemokines such as il-1β, tumour necrosis factor alpha , il- <dig> and il- <dig> , contrary to griesbeck-zilch in mec of mastitis resistant cows selected on qtl alleles  <cit> . however, integrin beta  <dig> , serum amyloid a  <dig> , a marker of acute inflammation  <cit> , s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig> , a member of the s <dig> family that is highly correlated with somatic cell count  <cit> , and the chemokine c-c motif ligand  <dig>  that triggers adhesion and transmigration of blood monocytes to/through endothelial cells were expressed at higher levels in susceptible animals. on the contrary, the expression of calpain  <dig>  was higher in resistant animals. this protein was shown to play a role in resting neutrophils and to operate as a negative regulator of protrusion and migration  <cit> . in the present study, although pro-inflammatory molecules have been widely shown to play an important role in neutrophil recruitment and imi outcome  <cit> , their expression patterns at  <dig> hours post-challenge were contrasted in resistant and susceptible lines and not correlated to differences in milk cell concentrations.

neutrophil diapedesis
furthermore, a group of genes related to cell adhesion and movement, including st <dig> beta-galactoside alpha- <dig> -sialyltransferase  <dig> , but also activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule , integrin alpha  <dig> , selectin platelet  and its ligand , were over-expressed in the resistant line. st3gal <dig> is involved in the synthesis of selectin ligand  <cit> . the selectins are fundamental for the attachment of neutrophils to the endothelial cell surface  <cit>  before diapedesis. these results suggest that neutrophil diapedesis might be more efficient in the resistant line.

tlr pathways
the genes cd <dig> and tlr <dig> that were expressed at a higher level in resistant animals and that are central in the network analysis collaborate together in the toll-like receptor  signalling pathway  <cit> . tlr <dig> is dedicated to gram-positive bacteria recognition  <cit>  and it may enhance the activation of neutrophil phagocytosis  <cit> . griesbeck-hilch et al.  <cit>  also found that tlr <dig> was up-regulated in mastitis resistant cows selected on markers for one qtl. the tlr <dig> signalling pathway may activate a cascade of intracellular events that may initiate the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes through the erk/mapk signalling pathway with consistent up-regulation of eif4ebp <dig> and itga <dig> in the resistant animals. this pathway is involved in oxidative stress which has been shown to contribute to the variability of susceptibility to imi in cattle  <cit> . altogether, the modification of tlr <dig> and mapk signalling pathways might be responsible for a higher uptake of bacteria by phagocytes, and therefore might contribute to the more efficient clearance of the infection in the resistant line.

transcription factors
a noteworthy fact is that considerable differences between lines were related to transcriptional activity within msc. the activator protein  <dig>  transcription factor is considered as an immediate-early response gene and is thought to be involved in a wide range of transcriptional regulatory processes linked to cellular proliferation and differentiation. rarα, tp <dig>  and ahr were also transcription factors of interest.

rarα, the alpha receptor of retinoic acid, a compound derived from vitamin a metabolism, is a nuclear receptor. it can affect several aspects of innate immunity by enhancing the function of neutrophils, macrophages and natural killer cells  <cit> . it has also been shown to play a role in helping the development of t helper cells, b-cells and, thus antibody-mediated response  <cit> , and more recently in modulating antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . retinoic acid metabolism has been shown to play a part in imi outcome, and dietary vitamin a supplementation has been reported to have a protective effect against experimental s. aureus mastitis in mice  <cit> . moreover, we found that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  was under-expressed, which is consistent with several studies that have demonstrated its interaction with ra-signalling pathways  <cit> . the involvement of ahr in the control of inflammatory responsiveness has been reported previously  <cit> . to our knowledge the role of tp <dig> in the response to bacterial infection has yet to be studied whereas it has been shown elsewhere to be associated with mastitis infected quarters  <cit> . tp <dig> was the gene that displayed the second highest ratio between lines and was over-expressed in the resistant line; it was highly associated with resistant animals in pca and was represented as a hub in ipa networks since it interacts with numerous other de genes. tp <dig> can be regulated by s100a <dig> proteins  <cit>  and jnk  <cit> , and in vitro it was shown to regulate tnfα and other cytokines  <cit> . tp <dig> has been largely studied in the cancer context for its role in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, dna repair and production of antioxidants  <cit> . furthermore, tp <dig> has already been shown to play a pivotal role in determining cellular response to stress via nfκb  <cit>  and tnfα  <cit> ; it may also enhance transcription of the complement regulator cd <dig>  <cit> . these observations suggest an important role of tp <dig> during bacterial infections.

granulopoiesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis
in addition, particular cell functions such as granulopoiesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis seemed to explain some of the differences between the lines. strong increases in neutrophil efflux from the bone marrow are followed by intense granulopoiesis and efflux of band cells that will later be recruited at the infection site: these cells may show higher transcriptional activity than mature neutrophils. gene expression analysis demonstrated that the transcription factors ccaat/enhancer binding protein , alpha  and rarα were up-regulated in the resistant line. cebpa is crucial for the differentiation of granulocytes  <cit>  and rarα has been shown to be directly involved in some aspects of the immune response by enhancing granulopoiesis  <cit> . collins et al.  showed that rarα can enhance granulocytic differentiation through a molecular pathway that is independent of cebpa  <cit>  suggesting that two different pathways stimulating granulopoiesis were up-regulated in the resistant line.

furthermore, a number of genes differentially expressed between the sheep lines was related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, e.g. mapre <dig>  znf <dig>  gzmh cryl <dig> and tp <dig>  these genes exhibited amongst the highest expression differences between lines. the genes encoding tp <dig>  and the lambda-crystallin protein  were expressed up to five times more in the resistant line. recently, cheng et al.  evidenced association between the expression of cryl <dig> and inhibition of cellular proliferation and cell growth  <cit> . this is in agreement with the decreased expression of both microtubule associated protein rp/eb family member  <dig>  and zinc finger protein  in resistant sheep. indeed, znf <dig>  has previously been shown to accumulate in the nucleus of proliferating cells  <cit>  and mapre <dig> has been associated during mitosis, with the centrosomes and spindle microtubules. apoptosis is a critical process necessary to limit or terminate inflammation  <cit>  and has previously been shown to be of importance in the response to s. aureus by lutzow et al.  <cit> . the gene expression of tp <dig> has been shown to increase in neutrophils during apoptosis  <cit> . these results suggest that cell proliferation is limited and apoptosis increased in resistant sheep as compared to susceptible sheep. altogether data support the hypothesis that, as a consequence of apoptosis/granulopoiesis, the cell turn-over may be enhanced in the resistant line when compared to the susceptible line.

collectively, these findings highlight leukocyte adhesion and cell migration, pathogen recognition through the tlr <dig> signalling pathway, and cell turn-over with the balance between apoptosis and granulopoiesis as possible mechanisms to explain a higher susceptibility or resistance to intramammary infection. nevertheless they probably give only a partial view as other cell types and compartments may be involved . also, other conditions  might have provided some different results. however, these results advocate the use of our differentially expressed gene list as a benchmark to more detailed genetic studies, including genome co-localisation of resistance to mastitis using qtl analysis as reviewed previously  <cit>  and polymorphism studies.

CONCLUSIONS
resistance to mastitis is the consequence of a fine-tuning of immune and inflammatory processes in a complex network of cell and gene interactions. our study has highlighted some of the possible mechanisms, such as pathogen recognition and neutrophil extravasation leading to improved immune responses against staphylococcus species and consequently, lower susceptibility to infection. the list of the differentially expressed genes between the resistant and susceptible animals provides relevant information for the identification of candidates for the genetic basis underlying resistance to mastitis. it paves the way for further genetic and mechanistic studies.
