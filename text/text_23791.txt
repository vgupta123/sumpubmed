BACKGROUND
zebrafish , a teleost fish with the extraordinary capacity to regenerate several organs and appendages, has been widely used as a model system to study epimorphic regeneration in adults. this organism presents several experimental advantages, such as a rapid and reliable regeneration process and amenability to molecular and genetic manipulation  <cit> . in particular, zebrafish fins are commonly used in regeneration studies. these appendages regenerate promptly after damage through a process that involves the coordination of diverse cellular mechanisms including migration, dedifferentiation, proliferation and patterning, to restore the shape, structure and function of the missing parts  <cit> .

shortly after fin amputation, epithelial cells surrounding the wound migrate to close the stump and establish the wound epidermis   <cit> . over time, the we acquires additional layers by continuous cell migration  <cit>  to give rise to a specialized epidermis called apical epithelial cap   <cit> , which is characterized by a robust secretory activity that is especially active in its basal epithelial layer   <cit> . between  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa, the mesenchymal tissue underneath the aec loses its organization and cells dedifferentiate and migrate distally towards the amputation plane  <cit> . subsequently, these cells re-enter the cell cycle to form the blastema, a highly proliferative mass of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, from which several cell types will differentiate in order to form the missing structures  <cit> . around  <dig> dpa, some of the blastemal cells lining the epithelial tissue start to differentiate into bone matrix secreting cells , in a process that is dependent on signals arising from the aec  <cit> . within the following  <dig> to 15 days the interactions established between the aec and the blastema ensure the outgrowth of the regenerating fin and during this period all cell types are re-patterned and a new fin is formed  <cit> . the bel has been proposed to play a decisive role in the regulation of growth and patterning throughout regeneration  <cit>  due to its proximity to the blastema and to the expression of factors implicated in the signalling to the blastemal cells, such as wnts , fgfs  and shh   <cit> .

the establishment and outgrowth of the blastema is a crucial step for tissue repair and its formation is under the control of different factors, including the presence of nerves at the site of injury . nerve dependence of vertebrate appendage regeneration has been studied for many decades. in the amphibian urodeles and in the teleost fundulus heteroclitus it is well documented that upon nerve fibre removal re-innervation of the stump is prevented and consequently limb/fin regeneration is impaired  <cit> . in zebrafish, it was recently demonstrated that the intramuscular injection of botulinum  alters bone ray outgrowth, patterning, and mineralization after caudal fin amputation  <cit> , reinforcing the idea that nerves are required for proper regeneration process.

several experiments in amphibians, where limb innervation was removed before or after amputation, have demonstrated that the early events, such as wound healing and initial blastema formation do not require nerve supply, but nerves are essential in promoting and sustaining the proliferation of blastemal cells  <cit> . these experiments have demonstrated that any component of the nerve  has the ability to stimulate regeneration, and have suggested that the signal emanating from nerves should be chemical rather than impulse conduction. axons have been proposed to release factors into the amputated limbs/fins that promote and sustain the proliferation of blastemal cells  <cit>  and/or target the we, which then signals to the underlying mesenchyme, inducing cell dedifferentiation and the establishment of an aec that is crucial for regeneration  <cit> . the important relation established between nerve fibres and the we is well represented by the accessory limb model  <cit> . this model is based on a set of experiments, which demonstrate that the axolotl limb regeneration is dependent on signals from both the we and nerve fibres. in this assay, a deviation of a nerve to the site of a lateral wound in the limb, leads to the formation of a blastema-like structure of undifferentiated cells , which does not continue to develop and eventually regresses. however, when a piece of skin is grafted to this wound, at the site of the deviated nerve, an ectopic blastema is formed originating an ectopic limb  <cit> . several fgfs  <cit> , members of the glial growth factor   <cit> , and other candidates, such as transferrin  <cit>  and substance p  <cit> , have been proposed to act as nerve-derived factors required for amphibian limbs regeneration. in newts, nag  was identified as a secreted molecule able to rescue a denervated blastema and induce regeneration of a denervated limb  <cit> . a negative model has also been proposed, where the degenerating axons and/or denervated schwann cells release an inhibitory factor that induces a negative response and inhibits regeneration  <cit> . nonetheless, a positive contribution model where nerves release a neurotrophic factor into the regenerating tissue has prevailed in the field  <cit> . supporting this view is the fact that secretory activity of neurons apparently changes during limb regeneration in the newt, possibly reflecting the formation and transport of trophic substances  <cit> .

despite the overall knowledge on nerve role in regeneration events, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still not fully understood, in part due to limitations to molecular and genetic manipulation in the model organisms previously studied. in this work we present a protocol for zebrafish pectoral fin denervation followed by amputation that allowed us to address the role of nerve fibres in fin regeneration. overall, our data shows that in the absence of nerves fins are able to close the wound and form a we, but cannot establish a functional aec. subsequently, fins fail the formation and outgrowth of the blastema, and accumulate several defects. our study establishes zebrafish as an in vivo valuable model to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie nerve contribution during vertebrate appendage regeneration.

RESULTS
resection of the brachial plexus is effective to denervate zebrafish pectoral fin
to determine whether zebrafish fin regeneration is dependent on a nerve supply, we developed an assay to ablate pectoral fin innervation by surgically removing part of the pectoral fin nerves, in the region of the brachial plexus . the right pectoral fin innervation was surgically removed before amputation, while the left one served as the innervated control . to evaluate the efficiency of this method, we performed immunofluorescence to label axons, using acetylated α-tubulin  as a marker, both in the innervated control and in the denervated discarded fin tissue, collected after amputation . fins that had been denervated presented very low levels or no ac.α-tub staining, both in the intra and inter-ray tissue , which confirmed that our denervation protocol is suitable to study nerve dependency during fin regeneration. due to the difficulty in the identification and access of the brachial plexus, which is deeply inserted in the tissue and runs along blood vessels, the complete elimination of nerves during the procedure was not possible in every fin. nevertheless, the quantification of our denervation success confirmed that only 4% of the fins had no elimination of nerves, while 14% presented total elimination of nerves and 82% showed only residual presence of nerves. the ac.α-tub staining of the discarded fin tissue collected after amputation allowed us to select the specimens where denervation was efficient to pursue our studies.figure  <dig> 
adult zebrafish pectoral fin denervation assay. a) pectoral fin innervation. the zebrafish pectoral fin is innervated by both sensory and motor nerves that descend from the spinal cord  and enter the pectoral fin region medially, as a combined brachial plexus  . sensory and motor axons then branch to serve the pectoral muscles and fin rays. sensorial nerves run both along the intra and inter-ray regions . b) denervation assay. the right pectoral fin was denervated  by transecting the nerve fibres in the brachial plexus region, while the left fin served as an innervated control . in the next day, the right fin was re-denervated to assure total nerve degeneration. after 6– <dig> hours both fins were amputated and the discarded tissue  was collected for ac. α-tub staining. fish were placed in 33°c water tanks and regeneration was allowed to proceed. re-denervation took place every day after amputation, to avoid nerve recovery. regenerates were collected for further analysis at specific time points post-amputation. c,d) pectoral fin denervation efficiency. staining for ac. α-tub in whole mount fins shows that nerve ablation at the level of the brachial plexus is efficient to deprive pectoral fins from its innervation. an innervated control fin , with bundles of axons running in the inter and intra-ray region , contrasts with a denervated fin , with fewer or any presence of the axonal marker ac. α-tub, inside and outside bony rays . the images are a projection of confocal optical slices. scale bar - 100 μm.



fin regenerative capacity is affected by denervation
after  <dig>  days of fin denervation  both denervated fins and their contra-lateral controls were amputated and individuals were allowed to regenerate . fins were collected and fixed for histological and gene expression analysis at different time points, which according to the literature represent key stages during fin regeneration: 6 hours post amputation , when the wound healing phase is occurring;  <dig> - <dig> dpa, when the wound healing phase is completed, the aec is formed, and cells dedifferentiate and migrate to the amputation plane; 1– <dig>  dpa, when the blastemal cells start to proliferate;  <dig> dpa, when the blastemal cells are highly proliferative leading to sustained outgrowth; and 2– <dig> dpa, when cells are proliferating and differentiating and the new fin is being re-patterned  <cit> . the presence of ac.α-tub, both in the discarded tissue and in the regenerating fins was analysed and the regeneration progress was evaluated. to clarify the effects of nerve absence during regeneration, several parameters were used to characterize control and denervated amputated fins, such as: size and width of rays; apoptosis; morphology; gene expression; and proliferation of blastemal cells.

similarly to controls, denervated fins were able to close the wound and form a we within the first hours after amputation. however, after  <dig>  dpa, the we of denervated fins was thinner than the controls . while in control fins, continuous cell migration led to a thickened epidermis , the we of denervated fins remained thin, with  <dig> to  <dig> layers of epithelial cells . after wound healing, during normal fin regeneration, the mesenchymal cells lying under the we migrate to the amputation plane to give rise to the blastema . however, at  <dig>  dpa 28% of denervated fins maintained a thin we and presented no blastema, while the other 72% formed a smaller blastema and regenerated only partially  . similarly, at  <dig> dpa, in the absence of a proper innervation 45% of denervated fins were not able to regenerate , while the other 55% had a small blastema. in later stages, from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, 64% of denervated fins were able to regenerate, although growing less than the controls , while the other 36% of denervated fins remained only with a thin we and with no blastema . in occasional cases where denervated fins could regenerate near to almost normal control fin sizes, ray patterning was always defective . in such cases, the fin rays were crooked and thinner  and consecutive rays often presented “merged blastemas” . in these malformed blastemas, the usual “wavy” appearance of the new fin, where each ray has its own cone shaped blastema , was replaced by a continuous tissue spanning several rays .figure  <dig> 
analysis of pectoral fin regeneration, upon denervation. a-l) staining for ac. α-tub in whole mount fins confirms the absense of nerve fibres at the amputation site of denervated fins. brightfield images demonstrate the difference in the extent of regeneration among fins . at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa denervated fins  have a we that is thinner than controls . from  <dig>  to  <dig> dpa, denervated fins are not able to form a normal blastema and regenerate . in some cases the blastema is completely absent , while in others a smaller and defective blastema is formed and fins regenerate partially . red arrowed solid lines indicate regenerated tissue length. m-p) defective denervated regenerating fins. denervated fins regenerate defectively and form “merged blastemas” on adjacent rays. the “wavy” appearance of new control fins, where each ray has its own cone shaped blastema , contrasts with denervated fins, where apparently several rays share a single, merged blastema . at  <dig> dpa denervated fins with a similar extent of regeneration as the controls , present a defective patterning . q) quantification of the area and length of regenerated tissue. measurements taken from the amputation site to the most distal tip reveal a consistent significant reduction  of denervated fins in relation to controls. r-t) influence of nerve quantity in fin regeneration. staining for ac. α-tub. in whole mount fins at  <dig> dpa show equal innervation and regeneration of control rays within the same fin , while denervated fins, the rays with less or no innervation present less or no regeneration , suggesting that the success of regeneration depends on the quanity of innervation for each ray. a-q and s-t) the images are a projection of confocal optical slices. dashed lines mark amputation plane. scale bar -  <dig> μm.



to quantify the differences between denervated and control fins we measured the area and length of the regenerated tissue, from the amputation site to the most distal tip. the results showed a consistent significant difference between denervated and control fins, with the first ones exhibiting an average reduction of 62% and 53% in area and length, respectively . in the surgical interventions where the complete elimination of nerves in the fin was not achieved we could observe that rays with less innervation were also the ones presenting less regeneration , suggesting a dependency on the quantity of innervation to fin regeneration efficiency, where the less innervated fins regenerated less tissue. besides being smaller, denervated fins were narrower than the controls  exhibiting an average reduction of 24% in the distance between pairs of consecutive rays . consecutive rays of denervated fins were closer to each other and, as described above, often presented “merged blastemas” . to investigate whether the narrowing of denervated fins and the thinner we phenotypes, described above, were due to cell death, we analysed the expression of activated caspase- <dig> in the we and inter-ray tissues . we detected more activity of caspase- <dig> in the we of denervated fins at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa, in comparison to control fins   where caspase- <dig> activation was detected only at later stages, during blastema growth . we have also observed more caspase in the inter-ray region, but only in the distal tip.figure  <dig> 
width of regenerated fins, upon denervation. a-d) brightfield images show that the inter-ray region of denervated fins is reduced in relation to controls. additionally, “merged blastemas”  are observed on consecutive rays at  <dig> dpa , in contrast to single-ray blastemas found in control fins . solid red arrowed lines indicate the inter-ray width. e) quantification of inter-ray width. measurements of rays and inter-ray units show that width of denervated fins is significantly smaller than that of the controls . f-i) apoptosis in whole mount amputated fins. staining for activated caspase <dig> and ac. α-tub/p <dig> in whole mount fins activity reveals an increase in apoptotic cells in the we and in the inter-ray region  of denervated fins, during the first day after amputation . at  <dig> dpa, activated caspase- <dig> is expressed in the epidermis of both control  and denervated and fins . a-d, f-i) the images are a projection of confocal optical slices. dashed lines mark amputation plane. scale bar - 100 μm.



in order to clarify the specific regeneration phases affected by nerve removal, we carried out additional denervation experiments in different time points. when denervation was performed during the formation of the blastema  after proper we establishment, fins presented a smaller regenerate when compared to the control . although significant, the difference between denervated and control fins was not as striking as when fins were denervated before amputation. when denervation was performed after the formation of the blastema  we could not detect a significant difference in fin outgrowth between denervated and control fins . however, in both cases denervated fins were still narrower than the controls  and exhibited some crooked rays. overall, the results indicate that nerves are crucial to zebrafish fin regeneration, playing a role not only in the initial steps of the regenerative progression, but also exerting their influence during the first two days of regeneration.

denervation affects proliferation of mesenchymal cells
during normal fin regeneration, mesenchymal tissue under the aec loses its organization, dedifferentiate and migrate towards the amputation plane, where it accumulates to form the blastema  <cit> . the presence of tenascin c, an extracellular matrix protein induced during newt limb and zebrafish fin regeneration upon mesenchyme disorganization  <cit> , suggests tissue remodelling in both control and denervated fins . in addition, morphological analysis of the tissue by toluidine blue histology revealed that the mesenchyme under the we was more disorganized in comparison to more proximal tissue , with cells presenting a more elongated shape, suggesting cell migration. these results indicate that the initial tissue remodelling can still occur upon amputation of denervated fins, but the subsequent blastema formation and growth is disrupted.

in order to determine how the cell cycle was affected upon fin denervation, we analysed the expression of three different cell cycle progression markers  and a checkpoint regulator , which is specifically expressed in the highly proliferative fin blastema cells  <cit> . pcna, which is expressed throughout g <dig> to m phases enabling the detection of a wide range of proliferating stages  <cit> , was equally expressed in the epidermal and mesenchymal cells of both control and denervated fins, at  <dig>  dpa . in control fins, at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, pcna staining accumulated in the mesenchyme above the level of amputation, in the region that gives rise to the blastema , while in denervated fins, pcna expression at later stages maintained the same pattern as  <dig>  dpa . analysis of geminin, which accumulates in the nuclei through s/g2/m phases of the cell cycle, was possible by using a transgenic zebrafish  that labels cell nuclei gfp during s/g2/m phases  <cit> . at early time points, no differences in geminin expression were observed in the mesenchyme of denervated fins in relation to controls . however, after  <dig>  dpa, geminin expression in the nuclei of denervated fins was reduced  and an accumulation of geminin-positive cells was observed above the amputation plane of control fins . mitotic cells, positive for h3p, were first detected at  <dig> dpa in some mesenchymal cells  and later maintained in the blastema and intra-ray mesenchyme of control fins . however, few positive cells were observed in denervated fins, and a significant difference exists between the number of positive h3p cells between control and denervated fins at  <dig>  and 2dpa  . in addition, the levels of expression of mps <dig>  a kinase that regulates the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint  in eukaryotic cells  <cit>  and that ensures genomic integrity by delaying cell cycle progression in response to a range of stress agents  <cit> , were significantly increased in denervated fins at  <dig> dpa, followed by a decrease at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa .figure  <dig> 
analysis of cell cycle markers in mesenchymal cells, upon denervation. a-f) staining for pcna in whole mount fins shows equal expression in epidermal and mesenchymal cells of both control and denervated fins at  <dig>  dpa . at  <dig> dpa, pcna-positive cells start to accumulate at the level of amputation in the region that will give rise to the blastema in control fins , which is not observed in denervated fins . at  <dig> dpa control fins show an accumulation of pcna-positive cells in the blastema region , while denervated fins resemble as  <dig>  dpa fins . g-j) live imaging with the tg. at  <dig> dpa geminin-positive cells are equally expressed in control  and denervated fins . gfp nuclei started to be evident in the mesenchyme above the amputation plane of control fins at  <dig>  dpa , but not in the denervated ones . k-o) staining for h3p in whole mount fins. h3p starts to be expressed at  <dig> dpa in some mesenchymal cells of control fins . at  <dig> dpa h3p-positive cells are present only in control fins  and in reduced number in partially regenerating denervated fins . note: h3p has a non-specific label in distal epidermal cells, as previously reported  <cit> . a-o) the images are a projection of confocal optical slices. dashed lines mark amputation plane. scale bar - 50 μm. p) qrt-pcr formps <dig>  mps <dig> levels of expression increase in denervated fins at  <dig> dpa and decrease at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa, in relation to controls .



together, these results indicate that upon amputation cell cycle re-entry of the mesenchyme is not affected by denervation. as the cell cycle markers pcna and geminin exhibit similar mesenchyme expression, both in denervated fins and in controls, it is likely that the g1-s and s-g <dig> transitions were not impaired by the lack of innervation. however, the transition g2-m seems to be affected because the expression of h3p, which marks only cells in the m phase, was reduced in denervated fins. the increase of mps <dig> levels of expression at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa on denervated fins is also compatible with a g2/m arrest.

structure and signalling of the aec is altered on denervated fins
in order to better understand the we phenotype, as well as to assess the formation of a functional aec, we analysed the expression of several epidermal regulators in control and denervated fins.

we have first investigated the presence of lef <dig>  a transcriptional target of the canonical wnt signalling pathway, known to be up regulated early in the we and maintained in the bel during the formation and outgrowth of the caudal fin blastema in more proximal cells  <cit> . lef <dig> was expressed in the bel of both control and denervated fins  with different domains of expression. at  <dig>  dpa lef <dig> was restricted to the most proximal bel cells in control fins, while it was expressed as a domain lining the mesenchymal cells of each ray in denervated fins . this was even more evident when assessing lef <dig> protein accumulation at 2dpa . moreover, denervated fins that were regenerating at  <dig>  dpa presented lef <dig> mrna expression spatially de-regulated, spread into the inter-ray region, suggesting that consecutive rays might have a continuous bel . regarding the levels of expression, measured by qrt-pcr, lef <dig> was decreased in denervated fins when compared with control fins .figure  <dig> 
gene expression in the we of control and denervated fins. a-x) mrna ish on whole mount amputated fins: lef <dig>  wnt5b, pea <dig>  krt <dig>  a’-x’) longitudinal sections of the rays using whole mount ish. a-g)
lef <dig> is expressed from  <dig>  to  <dig>  dpa in the bel of both control  and denervated fins . at  <dig>  dpa lef <dig> is expressed in the inter-ray region of non-regenerating  and partially regenerating denervated fins, where it forms what seems a shared bel on contiguous rays . h-o)
wnt5b is expressed in the we of both control  and denervated fins  from  <dig>  to  <dig> dpa. . in denervated fins, after  <dig>  dpa, wnt5b presents a spread and de-regulated expression domain . p-s)
pea <dig> is expressed in both control and denervated fins at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa, with a reduced expression in denervated fins . in controls pea <dig> is expressed in the whole we , while in denervates is restricted to the distal we cells . t-x)
krt <dig> is expressed in both control  and denervated fins  at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa, with a reduced expression in denervates . while in controls krt <dig> is strongly expressed in the whole we , in denervates it is restricted to some epidermal cells in the distal tip . a,a’-x,x’) dashed lines mark amputation plane. scale bar -  <dig> μm in whole mount;  <dig> μm in sections. y) qrt-pcr for genes expressed in the we. qrt-pcr analysis shows a decrease in the expression levels of analysed genes on denervated fins, in relation to controls, from  <dig>  to  <dig> dpa, except for wnt5b, which is increased at  <dig>  dpa. note: ***p <  <dig> , *p <  <dig> . data not evaluated for krt <dig> and fgf <dig>  at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa.



we have also investigated the expression of wnt5b, a non-canonical wnt ligand that is usually expressed early in the we and maintained in the distal bel cells during fin outgrowth  <cit> . wnt5b was expressed from  <dig>  dpa to  <dig> dpa, both in denervated and control fins , but qrt-pcr analysis showed an increment of 20% at  <dig>  dpa in denervated fins, which was followed by a decrease from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa . in cases where denervated fins were able to regenerate partially, wnt5b was expressed in a wider and irregular domain in the epidermis, suggesting a “merged blastema” with a common bel in two consecutive rays .

then, we analysed the expression of the fgf target gene pea <dig> and of fgf24/wfgf, to determine if the fgf signalling in the regeneration epithelium was affected by denervation. the epidermal regulator pea <dig>  which is expressed early in the we and maintained in distal bel cells during regenerative outgrowth  <cit> , was expressed in a thin domain in the distal cells of the we of denervated fins, at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa , while it was expressed in the whole we and inter-ray epidermis of control fins . additionally, analysis of qrt-pcr revealed a decrease in the levels of expression of pea <dig> in denervated fins from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa when compared with control fins . the ligand fgf <dig>  which is usually expressed in the distal bel cells during normal blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth  <cit> , was also downregulated in denervated fins at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa .

similar to pea <dig>  krt <dig>  a cytokeratin expressed in the we during the whole regenerative process  <cit> , was strongly expressed in the whole we of control fins , while in denervated fins it was weakly expressed in some distal epidermal cells . in addition, qrt-pcr revealed a decrease in krt <dig> levels of expression in denervated fins .

in summary, these results show that denervated fins were able to form a we, thinner than the controls, but that expressed fgf <dig>  pea <dig> and krt <dig>  as early as at  <dig>  dpa and throughout later stages. furthermore, the we of denervated fins presented a bel that expressed the usual markers lef <dig> and wnt5b, but qrt-pcr analyses and mrna or protein distribution showed that the patterns and relative levels of expression of these genes were remarkably altered in relation to controls. overall, the above results suggest that denervation may cause functional and morphological changes in the aec as well as interfere with the signalling pathways that coordinate its formation and maintenance.

blastema markers are altered on denervated fins
to investigate the impact of denervation in the signalling pathways that regulate blastema formation and outgrowth, we analysed the expression of several genes shown to play essential roles in those processes, namely, fgf20a, msxb, msxc, and fgfr <dig>  the ligand fgf20a, a key regulator of fin regeneration, is expressed in the epithelial-mesenchymal boundary during wound healing, co-localizing later with msxb in the blastemal cells  <cit> . in denervated fins fgf20a presented a weak expression and qrt-pcr analysis showed a consistent decrease in its levels of expression from  <dig>  to  <dig> dpa, when compared to controls . by contrast, the expression of the fgf inhibitor mkp <dig> was increased in denervated fins at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, in relation to controls . the fgf targets msxb and msxc are widely expressed in mesenchymal proliferating cells during caudal fin blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth  <cit> . based on in situ hybridization analysis, our data showed that msxb mrna started to be expressed at  <dig> dpa and it was maintained at  <dig> dpa, in both control and denervated fins , however, a reduced and more proximal domain was observed in denervated fins . analysis of qrt-pcr showed that the levels of expression of this gene were decreased at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa in comparison with control fins . msxc was also first detected by in situ hybridization at  <dig> dpa . although we could not detect msxc at  <dig>  dpa by in situ hybridization, its levels of expression measured by qrt-pcr were higher in denervated than in control fins . msxc expression was still detected in control and denervated fins at  <dig>  and 2dpa  both in the non-regenerating  and in the partially regenerating fins . when denervated fins regenerated partially, msxb and msxc expression was spread in the inter-ray region, reinforcing that in some cases, consecutive rays formed “merged blastemas” with contiguous domains of gene expression . similar to msxc, the expression of fgfr <dig> was increased in denervated fins at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa, followed by a decrease at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa . fgfr <dig> is usually expressed in blastema precursor cells underlying the we during blastema formation, and it has been shown to control expression of msx genes in this process  <cit> . overall, the above results showed that in denervated fins, the mesenchymal cells that give rise to the blastema exhibited significant changes in the expression of several markers. denervation had a clear impact on fgf signalling, and the most obvious effects were a reduction of the expression of the fgf20a ligand in all time points analysed, and an increased expression of mxsc and fgfr <dig>  up to  <dig> dpa.figure  <dig>

denervated fins exhibit scleroblast’s alignment defects
during normal fin regeneration, around  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, scleroblasts from the surrounding blastema start to align with the previously existing rays, along the bel, to deposit bone matrix into the epithelial–mesenchymal interface, which will be progressively mineralized giving rise to the new bony structures  <cit> . the deposition of cells positive for zns <dig>  a marker for scleroblasts at various stages of differentiation  <cit> , was observed in control fins just distal to the amputation plane aligned with the rays . however, in denervated fins, zns5-positive cells accumulating in the regenerating area did not align with the old bony rays, and instead started to deposit between the  <dig> hemi-rays at the site of amputation, below the bel . later, in most cases, the accumulation of scleroblasts expanded and closed the ray, forming a “cap-like” structure in the tip . in these fins, lef <dig> was ectopically expressed in the most distal bel cells .figure  <dig>

whole mount and sectioned samples stained with alizarin red s dye, which labels calcium deposition in bone matrix  <cit> , showed that the accumulation of scleroblasts was accompanied by deposition of new mineralized bone matrix , resulting in a thicker distal tip than the more proximal regions . in addition, bright field images and morphological analysis of denervated fins at  <dig> dpa also confirmed that extracellular matrix was deposited between the  <dig> hemi-rays at the level of amputation .

the above observations raised several questions. does the scleroblast accumulation in the stump of denervated fins originate from differentiated scleroblasts that have migrated from the stump to the amputation plane? or does it originate from newly differentiated scleroblasts that arose from the mass of mesenchymal cells? to address these issues, we analysed the dynamics of differentiating scleroblasts, known to contribute to the blastema in control situations  <cit> , using the zebrafish transgenic lines tg  <cit>  and tg  <cit> , which express gfp and mcherry under the control of a bglap/osteocalcin  and a sp7/osterix  promoters, respectively.

previous studies showed that differentiated scleroblasts from the stump, expressing the late bone differentiation marker oc  <cit> , start to proliferate at  <dig> dpa, detach and migrate to the amputation plane, where they dedifferentiate to contribute to the blastema population  <cit> . those scleroblasts, lose oc expression and re-express osx, a transcription factor present in early committed scleroblasts <cit> . the present results show that oc-expressing cells, apparently migrating from the stump tissue, were localized at the amputation level of both control and denervated fins at  <dig>  dpa . however, in the controls, oc-expressing cells were spread throughout the blastema , while in denervated fins, which have a residual or no blastema, remained at the amputation plane , being possibly responsible for the thickening of ray tips . furthermore, an outcross between the transgenics tg and tg showed that at  <dig> dpa the early scleroblasts marker osx was only present in control fins , indicating that in denervated fins scleroblasts did not dedifferentiate and re-express the early bone marker osx. this result suggests that the bone cells that have accumulated in the amputation plane  arise from bone-differentiated cells  that have migrated to the site of injury remaining there, without dedifferentiating.

in order to further characterise the effect of denervation in the spatial and temporal expression of genes involved in the deposition and alignment of new scleroblasts  <cit> , we analysed the expression of shh and its receptor ptc <dig>  shh mrna started to be express in the blastema of control fins between  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa , but not in the denervated ones . although shh was never detected by in situ hybridization at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa in control or denervated fins, qrt-pcr showed that the levels of expression of shh were lower in denervated fins at  <dig>  dpa, but in contrast abruptly increased at  <dig> dpa, decreasing again at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa . ptc <dig> levels of expression were also higher at  <dig> dpa and lower at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa in denervated fins, in comparison with the controls . ptc <dig> mrna started to be expressed in the stump at  <dig>  dpa and few differences were detected between control and denervated fins , however, at  <dig> dpa denervated fins only expressed ptc <dig> on the rays with a small blastema . together, these results indicate a de-regulation of shh signalling during fin regeneration in consequence of nerve ablation, and subsequent de-regulation of genes involved in the differentiation of the newly secreting bone cells at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa.figure  <dig>

anterior gradient proteins are expressed on regenerating fins
to further elucidate the molecular influence of nerves in zebrafish fin regeneration, we investigated the involvement of nag, a secreted protein able to rescue a newt denervated blastema  <cit> . we started by addressing the expression of two nag homologues: ag <dig>  <cit>  and agr <dig>  <cit> , during the regeneration of normal and denervated fins. agr <dig> expression has been previously reported during zebrafish development in several organs containing mucus-secreting cells, such as the epidermis, and in adult structures, such as the intestine  <cit> . however, the expression of ag <dig> in zebrafish embryos and adults had not been described before.

our results show that agr <dig> mrna was expressed in the mucus secreting cells of the epidermis of non-amputated fins , and maintained during all stages of regeneration in the entire epidermis of the fin, and also in the newly formed we . ag <dig> exhibited a similar mrna expression to agr <dig>  during development  <cit> , being present in the mucous secreting cells of the larval body at  <dig> hpf . however, ag <dig> was widely expressed in the epidermal cells in non-amputated and regenerating adult fins , not specifically in the mucus secreting cells. regarding nerve dependency, no differences were detected in the pattern of expression of both anterior gradient genes, between control and denervated fins . these results suggest that the anterior gradient protein family does not seem to play the same role during zebrafish fin regeneration as during amphibian limb regeneration.

discussion
in this report we describe an efficient protocol for zebrafish pectoral fin denervation, which allowed us to show that zebrafish fin regeneration is dependent on nerve supply and that the activity of several factors, known to be required for fin regeneration, is affected by fin denervation . following amputation, denervated fins were able to close the wound and establish a we within the first hours. however, the thickening of the we and consequent formation of the aec were severally affected by denervation, suggesting that the presence of nerve fibres in the site of injury is required immediately after wound closure. in the complete absence of nerve fibres in the stump, denervated rays were not able to establish a blastema and regeneration was impaired. however, in the presence of a reduced amount of nerves in the stump, a residual blastema was still formed and fins exhibited defective regeneration, giving rise to smaller and abnormal fins. the observation that rays with less innervation also showed less regeneration, suggests that there is a dependency on the quantity of innervation to fin regeneration efficiency. this quantitative requirement has been previously described in amphibians and in other teleosts, where a certain amount of innervation must be met for regeneration to be successful  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
contribution of innervation to fin regeneration. a) illustration of the putative role of nerves in zebrafish fin regeneration. the we is formed after fin amputation, in a process that is independent of nerves. innervation may be important to the subsequent thickening of the we and the establishment of the aec, which contributes to the formation and outgrowth of the blastema and to the progression of the regenerative process. the role of nerves may be to release factor  that regulate the expression of target genes in the we, such as pea <dig>  fgf <dig> and lef <dig>  which are important to the thickening and maintenance of the we and to the communication established with the underlying cells. at the same time nerves may be involved in the inhibition of wnt5b in the we, as well as in the pathways that lead to apoptosis. “factor x” may also be directly released by nerves into the stump to induce cell proliferation and dedifferentiation. b) illustration of the cellular and molecular changes occurred upon fin denervation. in the absence of innervation fins do not establish a functional aec and several signalling pathways are affected. wnt5b, an inhibitor of wnt signalling and regeneration, is upregulated at  <dig>  dpa, but is downregulated at  <dig> dpa. during this period krt <dig> and pea <dig>  which are essential to we maintenance, as well as fgf <dig> and lef <dig>  important for the communication established with the underlying cells, are downregulated. at the same time, apoptosis activity is increased in the we. the fgf signalling molecules fgfr <dig>  msxc, and mkp <dig> are upregulated, while fgf20a is downregulated. shh is early downregulated at  <dig>  dpa, but is then upregulated at  <dig> dpa. these signalling defects result in a breakdown of communication with mesenchymal cells, and impairment of the formation of the blastema and fin regeneration.



another consequence of nerve ablation was the narrowing of denervated fins, which has been previously observed in the fundulus heteroclitus experiments  <cit> . we were not able to conclude that apoptosis was responsible for this effect, since we did not observe caspase- <dig> activity in the entire inter-ray tissue, but only in its distal tip. therefore, we can only speculate that narrower denervated fins were a consequence of changes in tissue morphology that results from the absence of nerve fibres, or alternatively that the absence of fin movement observed after nerve ablation leads to subtle changes in the fin structure at the level of the inter-rays.

we have also observed a reduction in the size of the regenerates when denervation was performed at  <dig> dpa, during the formation of the blastema. however, when denervation was performed after the formation of the blastema we could not detect a significant difference in fin outgrowth between denervated and control fins. nevertheless, denervated fins were narrower than the controls and presented crooked rays, suggesting a less essential role in tissue morphogenesis during outgrowth. in amphibians, similar observations were obtained and the extent of regeneration impairment was shown to be dependent on the time point of limb denervation  <cit> . these results indicate that nerves are fundamental in the initial stages of the regeneration course, controlling the first steps of wound healing and formation of the blastema, the driving force of the all process, but that they also exert some effect in tissue morphogenesis upon regenerative outgrowth.

in order to understand the specific effect of denervation in each step of the regeneration process, we have analysed key molecular pathways associated with the establishment and maintenance of the we and blastema. the we of denervated fins were consistently thinner than the controls and did not develop into a fully functional aec. our observations of caspase- <dig> activity suggest that this was associated with the increased apoptosis observed in the epidermis of denervated fins. in addition, although the epidermal markers krt <dig>  lef <dig> and wnt5b could still be detected in the we of denervated fins, the levels and domains of expression were abnormal, which is a possible explanation for the observed defects. we can hypothesize that low levels of krt <dig> may contribute to the failure in the establishment of a functional we which consequently may lead to changes in gene expression, since keratins are required for the tensile strength of keratinocytes  <cit> , and have been proposed to play roles in stress response, cell signalling and apoptosis  <cit> . in the case of wnt5b, the upregulation in amputated denervated fins may be due to the suppression of an inhibitory mechanism that is normally activated by nerves. in turn, this wnt5b increased expression in denervated fins, contributes to explain regeneration impairment and lef <dig> downregulation. this hypothesis is based on previous work showing that high levels of wnt5b inhibit blastema proliferation and regenerative growth, by reducing the expression of wnt/β-catenin target genes, such as lef <dig>  during fin regeneration  <cit> . on the other hand, the ectopic expression of lef <dig> in distal bel cells in denervated fins might be related with the later downregulation of wnt5b observed after 1dpa, as during normal fin regeneration wnt5b expression in the distal bel cells restricts lef <dig> expression domains  <cit> . it is worth to note that the correct levels of wnt signalling need to be precisely controlled during regeneration. wnt signalling has been proposed to orchestrate fin regeneration  <cit>  and overexpression of a wnt/ßcatenin signalling inhibitor , resulted in improper specification of the we, with lower levels of lef <dig>  and also in downregulation of the blastema markers msxb and fgf20a  <cit> . such reduction in gene expression caused by wnt signalling inhibition is similar to the reduction in expression of wnt targets in the blastema of denervated fins.

our results also showed that a number of other genes that are essential players during blastema formation, namely msxb, msxc, fgfr <dig> and fgf20a were significantly altered in denervated fins. the consistent low levels of expression of the ligand fgf20a, which is required for fin regeneration initiation and blastema formation/proliferation  <cit> , might be responsible for the failure of correct blastema formation and outgrowth, while low levels of msxb at  <dig>  and  <dig> dpa may be an indirect consequence of the lack of blastema. we can speculate that fgfr <dig> upregulation might be part of a compensatory mechanism induced by the downregulation of fgf signalling in the absence of nerves. the increased expression of this receptor at early time points might then induce the early upregulation of msxc, which has been shown to act downstream of fgfr <dig> during fin regeneration  <cit> . also, the upregulation of the mapk phosphatase, mkp <dig>  in denervated fins might reflect a compensatory mechanism induced by the downregulation of fgf signalling. mapk is a highly conserved pathway involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration  <cit>  that is both a downstream target and an inhibitor of the fgf pathway  <cit> . in experiments where this pathway was inhibited after fin amputation, a we was formed and the initial disorganization and migration of mesenchymal cells proximal to the level of amputation still occurred  <cit> , but regeneration was blocked, similarly to what we show in the absence of nerves. in summary, our data strongly suggest that fgf signalling is involved in the contribution of nerves to fin regeneration.

the present results indicate that denervation caused molecular, functional, and morphological changes in the blastema and regenerating epithelium. the lack of innervation resulted in a failure to accumulate additional epithelial layers and to coordinate the correct bel signalling events, compromising the communication with the underlying mesenchyme. it is important to stress that the secretory activity of the bel is crucial to the epithelial-mesenchymal communication that assures the success of blastema formation and outgrowth  <cit> . if nerves exert their function through targeting the aec, which then signals to the underlying mesenchymal cells inducing cell dedifferentiation and proliferation, the formation of a defective aec certainly affects this process. indeed, our results showed that although mesenchymal cells underlying the we of denervated fins became disorganized, they failed to form a proliferative blastema and regenerate. the alterations on the expression of cell cycle progression markers, together with the initial increase of mps <dig> on denervated fins, suggests that these cells were able to enter the cell cycle, but were then arrested in the g/m transition, blocking blastema growth. these results are in accordance with previous studies in denervated amphibians limbs showing that tissue dedifferentiation could still occur upon amputation of denervated limbs and a normal percentage of cells re-entered the cell cycle. however, most of those cells failed to progress through the s phase and the blastema did not form  <cit> .

besides the clear role of nerves in the we and blastema formation we were surprised to observe that scleroblast activity in the regenerating area was not completely impaired, but instead led to ectopic deposition of bone matrix in the ray stump forming a “cap-like” mineralized structure. these observations led to the analysis of shh pathway, known to control scleroblasts differentiation, alignment, and proliferation during fin regeneration  <cit> . we were able to see that shh expression was altered in denervated fins, being decreased at  <dig>  dpa and then increased at  <dig> dpa together with its target gene ptc <dig>  previous work has shown that upon shh inhibition during fin regeneration, blastema proliferation is arrested  <cit> , and shh overexpression results in ectopic bone deposition and abnormal patterning  <cit> . additionally, in the absence of a properly formed blastema, the bel cells may direct this factor into areas where it is normally not secreted, leading to incorrect scleroblast’s alignment. we can also speculate that the increment in shh expression observed in denervated fins at  <dig> dpa was due to the increase in fgfr <dig>  as fgf signalling has been proposed to be required for normal expression of shh in the fin regenerate  <cit> .

previous work in amphibians has suggested that nerves exert their function by releasing specific factors crucial for the activation and maintenance of the regeneration process  <cit> . in zebrafish, the requirement of innervation during fin regeneration also seems to depend on the release of factors  that target the we and/or are directly secreted into the stump . in amphibians, fgfs  <cit> , neuregulin  <cit> , gdf <dig>  <cit> , transferrin  <cit>  and substance p  <cit>  have been suggested to play the role of such factors. in newts, nag has been proposed to be the nerve-secreted factor that underlies regeneration dependency on nerves  <cit> . we have explored a parallel function in zebrafish, but our results suggest that the anterior gradient  protein family do not play the same role as in newts. this is not completely unexpected, as newts seem to have evolved species-specific interactions that are not present in teleosts. in newts, nag interacts with the cell surface determinant of positional identity, prod <dig>  a salamander-specific member of the three-finger protein  family, with no obvious homologues in other vertebrates  <cit> . nag activity in other vertebrates would require another receptor, possibly a taxon-specific tfp, in place of prod <dig>  <cit> . this interpretation is in line with the hypothesis that regeneration results from multiple, independent evolutionary origins. in this scenario, the regeneration of salamander’s limbs has evolved locally and it is regulated at least in part by taxon-specific components, which in salamander involved the expansion of the tfp family  <cit> . moreover, recent phylogenetic analysis of ag proteins has shown that fish agr <dig> is more similar to agr <dig> of higher vertebrates than amphibians  <cit> . thus, it is possible that trophic factors released by nerves have followed alternative evolutionary routes in different species. it is also conceivable that nerves secrete more than one trophic factor and that there are both different and common factors across species.

in zebrafish, it is conceivable that ffgs, wnts, or shh are secreted by fin nerve fibres, as these factors have been shown to be produced by nerves in other systems  <cit> , and the effects of manipulating their levels during fin regeneration have some similarities with the effects of fin denervation. in the case of fgfs, there are reports in amphibian limb regeneration proposing such role  <cit> , but in zebrafish fins it is unlikely that fgf is the factor released by nerves since its downstream targets, msxc and mkp <dig> were increased in denervated tissue. also, our results do not support the hypothesis of shh playing the role of ”factor x”, because in the absence of innervation, its target, ptc <dig>  is only affected significantly after  <dig> dpa. regarding wnts, there are no previous indications that any of the members of this family can be released by nerves in the context of regeneration, but our data does not rule it out. both in denervated fins and in wnt loss of function experiments  <cit> , the target lef <dig> is significantly reduced and the establishment of the we and its subsequent thickening is severely compromised. taken together the above results indicate that contribution of nerves to regeneration involves the regulation of ffg, wnt and shh signalling pathways. however, the effects of nerve absence seem to be more complex than the disruption of any of the pathways alone and may reflect combined effects of multiple signalling cascades.

CONCLUSIONS
this study contributes to establishing the zebrafish pectoral fin as an in vivo valuable model to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of nerve dependence during vertebrate regeneration. we have shown, for the first time, that zebrafish fin regeneration is dependent on proper nerve supply. our results indicate that denervation produces a dysfunctional attempt at regeneration: in the absence of innervation fins are able to form a thin we, but do not establish a functional aec and proliferation of blastemal cells is not sustained . defects in the aec are detrimental to regeneration since this structure establishes a crucial communication with the underlying mesenchyme to promote the proliferation of blastemal cells. we show that factors known to play a role in regeneration, including members of the fgf, wnt and shh signalling cascades, are affected by denervation suggesting that these signalling factors mediate the action of nerves. the role of nerves may be to release a “factor x”, which interferes with the expression of those signalling pathways, directly or indirectly, to produce the appropriate expression levels of the factors that are required for a productive regenerative process.
