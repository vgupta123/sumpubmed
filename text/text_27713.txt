BACKGROUND
aspergillus westerdijkiae , a filamentous fungus branched from the a. ochraceus taxon  <cit> , has a worldwide distribution and mainly colonizes agricultural crops and various food commodities, such as coffee, beer, wine, milk, grapes, oranges, and juice . previous studies have shown that a. westerdijkiae is also present in house dust and indoor air fallout  <cit> , and some other subtypes are found in deep sea environments  <cit> .

filamentous fungi of the aspergillus genus are among the most prolific sources of secondary metabolites with biomedical and commercial importance  <cit> . a. westerdijkiae is known as the main ochratoxin a -producing species, of which approximately 70 % of the strains are able to produce ota  <cit> . ota, a polyketide secondary metabolite, is potentially carcinogenic in humans through its induction of oxidative dna damage  <cit>  and is neurotoxic, with a strong affinity for the brain  <cit> . in addition, ota can induce renal adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas in rodents  <cit> . numerous studies aimed at the mechanism of ota production and its activity have been conducted . researchers also developed a real-time quantitative pcr protocol to detect and quantify a. westerdijkiae contamination in grapes and green coffee beans, focussing on the its1- <dig> s-its <dig> region within the rdna unit, which serves as a tag to evaluate a. westerdijkiae contamination and has been frequently used to discriminate at the species level  <cit> .

thus far, phylogenetic studies examining a. westerdijkiae have had been performed with only three or four gene loci  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis using a small number of concatenated genes may have a high probability for supporting conflicting topologies, while an analysis with whole-genome data could provide greater resolving power by allowing trees to be constructed based on all available concatenated sets of genes  <cit> . in this study, we used  <dig> highly conserved single-copy orthologous gene sets found in whole genome-wide searches to infer the phylogenetic relationships between a. westerdijkiae and the eight other aspergillus species.

enzymatic degradation of plant polysaccharides in fungi is notable for its relevance in many industrial applications, such as paper, food, animal feed, biofuel, and chemicals . fungi have been used to subsist on various types of plant biomass as a carbon source by producing enzymes that degrade cell well polysaccharides in the exterior milieu into simple monomers for nutrition  <cit> . localized degradation of the cell wall also allows for penetration and spreading across host tissues  <cit> . the cazy database  has classified the enzymes degrading or modifying plant polysaccharides into carbohydrate-active enzymes and has divided them into different families. a previous study comparing eight sequenced aspergilli genomes revealed that the related fungi employed diverse enzymatic strategies to degrade plant biomass and provided detailed categorization for these species. this study provided practical knowledge to further analyse the capability of plant polysaccharide depolymerization of a. westerdijkiae  <cit> . interestingly, the latest studies revealed that a. westerdijkiae ota production had no positive relationship with growth or sporulation and was markedly variable both qualitatively and quantitatively among different substrates  <cit> .

fungi are also deemed to be a potential source of proteases due to their broad biochemical diversity  <cit> . enzymatic proteolysis has many extremely important applications in the pharmaceutical, medical, food, and biotechnological industries  <cit> . the merops database  is an integrated resource for proteases and the proteins that inhibit proteases. this database has organized peptidases into various families on the basis of statistically significant similarities in amino acid sequences and includes a batch blast prediction tool  <cit> .

until now, studies examining a. westerdijkiae have only employed low-throughput experimental approaches or in vitro observation to check for known characteristics and to explore unknown features. these methods are useful for making reliable conclusions but are not ideal for exploring unknown characteristics.

in this study, we sequenced and assembled a complete genome of a. westerdijkiae nrrl  <dig> using an illumina miseq platform. we analysed the genome to identify the genes that might be secreted and might contribute to pathogenicity and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. domains of each component of all of the predicted sm gene clusters were annotated, and we provided the detailed annotation for two putative ota-related gene clusters, a putative notoamide biosynthetic gene cluster and a putative hexadehydro-astechrome  biosynthetic gene cluster. we also examined the classification of the plant polysaccharide degradation enzymes and found that the union of gh <dig> and aa <dig> present in one of the ota-related sm gene clusters might be associated with the responses of a. westerdijkiae growing in different media. we also compared its genome and proteome similarities, evolutionary relationship, and plant biomass degradation potential to those of eight sequenced aspergillus species: a. flavus, a. clavatus, a. fumigatus, a. nidulans, a. niger, a. oryzae, a. terreus, and n. fischeri . the information contained in this study could be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanisms and the evolution of this important aspergillus species.

RESULTS
genome details and comparative analysis
the a. westerdijkiae genome was sequenced to  <dig> x coverage using an illumina miseq platform  <cit> . the complete sequences for the whole genome shotgun projects have been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession numbers lkbe <dig>  the version described in this paper is the first version lkbe <dig> . the genome assembly is approximately 36 m in size and includes  <dig> scaffolds with an n <dig> length of  <dig> ,627 bp . comparatively, a. westerdijkiae has a similar genome size to the sister group a. flavus and a. oryzae, which differ considerably from the others . to assess the gene space in the a. westerdijkiae genome, we used a set of  <dig> core eukaryotic genes to perform cegma prediction, which showed that  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes were completely matched to our assembled genome. this finding suggested that we had successfully assembled approximately 95 % of all a. westerdijkiae genes  <cit> . in this case,  <dig>  protein-coding genes were predicted using the annotation pipeline maker <dig> to integrate evidence from multiple databases with the gene-finding programs snap and augustus. the predicted transcripts and proteins have been deposited in supplementary information . these putative protein-coding genes cover  <dig>  % of the nucleotide sequence of the a. westerdijkiae genome. compared to increasing the genome size, using a strict prediction method may lead to a relatively lower value of gene density in a. westerdijkiae . of the  <dig>  predicted genes of a. westerdijkiae,  <dig>  were assigned as hypothetical, and  <dig>  were considered as unique, without any matches in the ncbi non-redundant  database and the uniprot knowledgebase.table  <dig> genome characteristics and predicted features of the assembled a. westerdijkiae strain cbs 112803



over  <dig> scaffolds of a. westerdijkiae were finally assembled in this study. any gaps between the scaffolds might be due to one of the reasons. comparative analysis could be used to find conserved regions among the genomes and to infer the probable collinearity of the assembled scaffolds. pairwise comparisons between a. westerdijkiae and the eight sequenced aspergillus genomes were conducted by applying the scaffolds greater than 100 kb in these genomes to the nucmer programs   <cit> . a total of  <dig> scaffolds from a. westerdijkiae larger than 100 kb in length and covering more than 97 % of the genome were extracted . scaffolds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> displayed relative conservation among these sequenced aspergilli, and scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> were shown to be possibly syntenous.fig.  <dig> dotplot view of the nucmer genome alignment between the a. westerdijkiae genome and the other selected aspergillus genomes . each subgraph represents a comparison between the a. westerdijkiae genome and another selected aspergillus genome. in each subgraph, the x-axis refers to the  <dig> largest supercontigs of a. westerdijkiae sorted in decreasing order of size, and the y-axis refers to the supercontigs of another selected genome sorted in decreasing order of size



although in the same genus, the aspergilli also show extensive structural reorganization and differ in their genome sequences. only less than  <dig>  % of the nucleotides of a. westerdijkiae were shared with aspergilli, with an average of 88 % identity. and the alignment displayed an average of 68 % amino acid identity, comparable to similar findings among a. fumigatus, a. oryzae, and a. nidulans   <cit> . a. westerdijkiae and a. nidulans showed the lowest similarity; therefore, we selected a. nidulans as the outgroup for the phylogenetic tree construction.

phylogenetic relationship
in this study, we used the entire dataset of concatenated single-copy orthologous proteins to build the phylogenetic tree. using the perl script proteinortho,  <dig> orthologous clusters were present as single copies across the nine aspergillus species. we further built the maximum likelihood  tree based on the orthologous proteins, selecting a. nidulans as the outgroup   <cit> . this tree illustrated that a. westerdijkiae was most closely related to a. oryzae and a. flavus and the opportunistic pathogen a. terreus. a. oryzae has been used in the fermentation process of several traditional japanese beverages and sauces  <cit> . a. flavus is well known for producing the potent carcinogen aflatoxin  <cit> . the profile of this phylogenetic tree was consistent with those reported in previous studies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a maximum likelihood phylogenomic tree was inferred on the basis of  <dig> concatenated orthologous single-copy amino acid sequences of the nine aspergillus genomes  using the dayhoff model in tree-puzzle



predicted secreted proteins involved in virulence or detoxification
a. westerdijkiae is one of the phytopathogenic fungi that can cause serious diseases. secreted enzymes play crucial roles in pathogenicity and virulence  <cit> . with the in silico pipeline described in the methods section,  <dig> out of the  <dig>   predicted proteins were potentially secreted proteins, close to the average 8 % found in other aspergillus species  <cit> . by performing a whole-proteome blast against the pathogen-host interaction  database,  <dig> out of  <dig>   predicted proteins encoded by the a. westerdijkiae genome were determined to share homology with the genes implicated in pathogenicity and virulence in the phi-base, of which  <dig>  putative phi-related proteins are potential secreted proteins. cytochrome p <dig> enzymes not only participate in the production of the metabolites important for the organism’s internal needs but also play critical roles in adaptation to diverse environments by modifying harmful environmental chemicals. using blast to search the fungal cytochrome p <dig> database, we found that  <dig> out of  <dig>   predicted proteins matched to  <dig> out of  <dig>  cyp450s, of which  <dig> putative cyp <dig> enzymes were predicted to be secreted, most of which were involved in pathogen-host interactions . according to the result of orthologous analysis,  <dig> putative phi-related genes can be found across all the sequenced aspergilli, while  <dig> genes were only expressed in a. westerdijkiae.fig.  <dig> venn-plot showing the intersections among the secreted phi proteins , secreted proteases , secreted cyp <dig> enzymes , and secreted cazymes 



carbohydrate-active enzymes 
secreted cazymes are crucial for fungal biological activity. using the common cazy annotation pipeline  for genomic analysis of fungi, which was also adopted to perform similar analyses in previous studies  <cit> , we explored the a. westerdijkiae genome for genes coding carbohydrate-active enzymes and carbohydrate-binding modules . we identified  <dig> putative cazy-coding genes falling into  <dig> families and  <dig> putative cbm-coding genes in  <dig> families . the wilcoxon rank-sum test based on the gene counts in these families showed that the family distribution of the enzyme genes had no significant difference  between a. westerdijkiae and the other aspergillus genomes. the heatmap based on family classification suggested that a. westerdijkiae, along with a. oryzae and a. flavus, tend to be similar in degrading carbohydrates . a. niger, a. westerdijkiae, a. oryzae, and a. flavus are known to colonize cereal grains, legumes, tree nuts, fruits, and vegetables, while the species in another clade, including a. clavatus, a. fumigatus, n. fischeri, a. nidulans, and a. terreus, are involved in decomposing vegetation and decaying organic matter, such as animal manure.fig.  <dig> comparison of the cazymes identified in the genomes of the selected fungi using hierarchical clustering. the fungi analysed along with a. westerdijkiae were a. oryzae, a. flavus, a. terreus, a. niger, a. fumigatus, n. fischeri, a. clavatus, and a. nidulans. the enzyme families are represented by their classes  and the family numbers from the hmm predictions based on the carbohydrate-active enzyme database. the abundance levels of the different enzymes within a family are represented by a colour scale from the lowest  to the highest occurrences  per species



the glycoside hydrolase , carbohydrate esterase , and polysaccharide lyase  groups include major plant polysaccharide degradation  enzyme families, also called cell wall-degrading enzymes  due to their role in the disintegration of the plant cell wall exerted by bacterial and fungal pathogens  <cit> . the proteins containing cazy domains in these families were considered as candidate proteins involved in the enzymatic degradation of plant polysaccharides . in the a. westerdijkiae genome, the percentages of pdd-related proteins in gh and pl groups were  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, which ranked together second only to a. terreus . we found that  <dig>  % of the  <dig> putative cazy-coding genes were ppd-related in the ce group, which had a low distribution in the aspergillus genomes, which was comparable to the percentages found in other species  <cit> .

using comprehensive annotation and comparison analysis, we predicted  <dig> pdd-related enzymes, of which  <dig>  enzymes were annotated based on orthologous clustering. this annotation covered  <dig> ppd-related candidate proteins with cazy domains . of the remaining candidate proteins,  <dig> genes were inferred in terms of kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes , conserved domains database , and pfam annotations, whereas the  <dig> remaining potential pdd-related enzyme genes with only cazy annotations were unknown due to the lack of reliable information, requiring further experimental data to infer their functions . with this information regarding the putative enzyme code, we compared the degradation potentials for cellulose, xyloglucan, xylan, galactomannan, pectin, starch, and insulin with those of the eight aspergilli based on their genome content  <cit> . we found that the predicted proteins of the a. westerdijkiae genome covered all of the enzyme activities, with many of them involved in pectin degradation.

in addition, the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> , which contains all fungal chitinases, was responsible for the remodelling and recycling of the fungus’ own cell wall with other cell wall degrading enzymes  <cit> . gh <dig> was the third major family in the glycoside hydrolase class. of  <dig> predicted enzymes in gh <dig>  five were identified as secreted and pathogenic. the auxiliary activities  class contained enzymes with the potential capacity to help the original gh, pl, and ce enzymes gain access to the carbohydrates encrusted in the plant cell wall. in this class, the aa <dig> family contained  <dig> secreted enzymes. we also identified  <dig> secreted enzymes belonging to the family lpmo ; these enzymes are crucial for lignin breakdown  <cit> . aas contained the highest proportion  of the enzymes related to pathogenicity and virulence. cbm <dig> carbohydrate-binding modules, also known as lysm domains, were widely conserved in the fungal kingdom and might be functional in the virulence effects of plant pathogenic fungi for dampening host defence  <cit> . based on the cazy annotation pipeline, we identified  <dig> predicted proteins containing cbm <dig> modules. in summary,  <dig> out of  <dig> putative secreted cazymes were predicted to be potential phi-related proteins. most of these phi-related cazymes were in the family aa <dig> , gh <dig> , ce <dig> , aa <dig> , and gh <dig>  . these families may be observed in the close phylogenetic profiling clusters in fig.  <dig> 

proteases
peptidases, which degrade proteins to provide an alternative carbon source, can be secreted during the infection process  <cit> . therefore, we performed a batch blast search against the merops protease database and identified  <dig> protease-coding genes, which were classified into  <dig> categories consisting of  <dig> subfamilies, and  <dig> inhibitor-coding genes . of all of these putative proteases,  <dig> were predicted as secreted proteases, of which  <dig> exhibited homology with the pathogenicity- and virulence-related genes in the phi database  and belonged primarily to the families s09x , s <dig> , and a01a . all of the predicted proteases in the s09x family contained ce <dig> domains .

from a general view, the largest category of predicted proteases in the a. westerdijkiae genome was serine peptidases, with  <dig> genes belonging to  <dig> families. the top two families of predicted serine peptidases were prolyl oligopeptidase  and prolyl aminopeptidase . s <dig> was the largest family identified in the genome. metallo   was the second largest protease category, of which glutamate carboxypeptidase  was the largest family. other abundant families were pepsin a  within aspartic  proteases, ubiquitin-specific peptidase  <dig>  in cysteine  proteases, and archaean-proteasome beta component  in threonine  proteases.

the biosynthetic potential of a. westerdijkiae suggested by a large number of secondary biosynthetic gene clusters
filamentous fungi produce many bioactive secondary metabolites, such as various mycotoxins or other bioactive compounds that have been exploited in pharmaceuticals  <cit> . the genes responsible for the production of the secondary metabolites tend to be organized in biosynthetic gene clusters  <cit> . using the scaffolds as the query sequences of the antismash  <dig>  platform, we found many short and dense fragments present in some sm gene clusters, suggesting low prediction accuracy. therefore, we constructed putative sm gene clusters according to the procedure described in the methods section. in this case, a total of  <dig> putative secondary biosynthetic gene clusters, which spread on  <dig> scaffolds and a contig, were identified . the total length of these scaffolds and contig covered  <dig>  % of the assembled sequences. many of the putative sm gene clusters belong to type i pks  or non-ribosomal peptide synthase  gene clusters, while the remainder were terpene, indole, or other hybrid gene clusters . the number of putative pks gene, nrps gene and hybrid nrps/pks gene of a. westerdijkiae is comparable to other aspergilli predicted by previous studies, such as a. nomius, a. nidulans, a. flavus and a. oryzae .table  <dig> classification of putative secondary metabolite clusters of a. westerdijkiae predicted by antismash



the previous studies successively concluded two portions of the sequences of the t1pks genes involved in the biosynthesis of the ota mycotoxin  <cit> . silencing either of the two genes might inhibit ota production, suggesting that the two clusters jointly play a role  <cit> . in this study, we predicted more complete sequences of the two t1pks genes and classified them into two distinct putative sm gene clusters: i) cluster <dig>  located on scaffold <dig> , includes  <dig> genes; and ii) cluster <dig>  located on scaffold <dig> , includes  <dig> genes. the genes in cluster <dig> successively encoded a pks , an nrps , a cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase , a bzip transcription regulator , and a halogenase  . they shared  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % amino acid identity with  <dig> out of  <dig> co-expressed genes   in cluster <dig> of aspergillus carbonarius, respectively  <cit> . however, the rest of the genes in both clusters were non-homologous under the blast search e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  in addition, cluster <dig> of a. westerdijkiae also included a zn2cys transcription regulator  and a sugar transporter .fig.  <dig> two ota biosynthesis-related gene clusters for a. westerdijkiae. a cluster <dig>  with  <dig> genes located on scaffold <dig> . b cluster <dig>  with  <dig> genes located on scaffold <dig> . the pks and nrps domains were determined by the blast searches against the cdd database



the putative cluster <dig> encoded a pks , a cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase , an acyl-coa synthetase , and two transporters  . the pks gene was originally classified as two separate genes  by the make <dig> prediction pipeline. further domain prediction and homology analysis suggested the two genes should be integrated despite the junction showing low similarity in blast search. therefore, we chose the gene model sc45_org <dig> predicted by antismash as the integrated gene in this cluster, which shares  <dig>  % amino acid identity with the ceg  <dig> in cluster <dig> of aspergillus carbonarius, while awe <dig> shares  <dig>  % amino acid identity with the adjacent ceg  <dig> coding a cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase. no additional homologous genes were found between these two clusters. a putative acetyl-coa synthetase was predicted to be present next to the pks. acetyl-coa, used as a carbon source in polyketide biosynthesis, is likely to be a precursor for ota synthesis  <cit> . we subsequently identified a gh <dig> enzyme gene, acting as a beta glucosidase, in the 3’ direction of the pks gene. pathway analysis indicated that this putative gh <dig> enzyme gene participated in starch and sucrose metabolism. based on the blast and domain analyses, we also predicted an aa <dig> enzyme gene close to the gh <dig> enzyme genes. the predicted aa <dig> enzyme gene belonged to the glucose-methanol-choline  oxidoreductase family and could be further categorized into the aa3_ <dig> family containing glucose 1-oxidase. we found that the gh <dig> and aa <dig> enzymes could be classified into the close phylogenetic profiling clusters summarized in the heatmap of cazymes, which suggested that the aa <dig> enzymes might act in conjunction with gh <dig> enzymes. moreover, it was observed that these two genes did not belong to any orthologous cluster. in summary, these two genes might have important influences on ota production in various substrates. this suggestion is in agreement with the observation that a. westerdijkiae possessed the highest capability for producing ota in media containing high amounts of sucrose and glucose, such as paprika-based medium, while ota was absent in grape-based medium, in which fructose is the most abundant compound  <cit> . with domain prediction, the structure of pks in putative cluster <dig> of a. westerdijkiae, the partial sequence of which was reported as lc35- <dig> , was ks-at-dh-mt-kr-acp-c-a. these two putative structures of pks could be divided into two different fungus-reducing pks clades: the former was clade i, while the latter was clade ii due to the loss of the er domain  <cit> . we also detected a putative methylsalicylic acid pks gene  with  <dig>  % sequence identity with “aomsas” , pks gene involved in the biosynthesis of isoasperlactone and asperlactone and reported previously in a. westerdijkiae  <cit> .

non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes are responsible for the synthesis of natural peptide-based microbial products. we identified a total of  <dig> putative nrps genes distributed in different gene clusters in the a. westerdijkiae genome. we further predicted a notoamide biosynthetic gene cluster centred on an nrps gene in the a. westerdijkiae genome, suggesting that a. westerdijkiae should be able to produce notoamide and the related structural derivatives   <cit> . moreover, because of the homology shared with the characterized biosynthetic gene clusters in a. fumigatus af <dig>  a. westerdijkiae is likely to produce the widely occurring siderophore hexadehydro-astechrome   . in the a. westerdijkiae genome, we also predicted several nrps gene clusters producing di- and three-peptide alkaloids containing the amino acid anthranilate.fig.  <dig> the putative notoamide biosynthetic gene cluster of a. westerdijkiae found in this study and the comparison of this cluster with the notoamide cluster reported for aspergillus versicolor and aspergillus sp. mf297- <dig>  gene cluster description of aspergillus versicolor and aspergillus sp. mf297- <dig> was acquired from minimum information about a biosynthetic gene cluster  database under accession number bgc <dig>  and bgc <dig> , respectively

in a. westerdijkiae, we also predicted several hybrid nrps/pks gene whose products remain to be determined. in addition to the pks, nrps, and hybrid nrps/pks gene clusters, we also identified  <dig> gene clusters likely to produce terpenes, including two hybrid terpene-pks gene clusters. in this study, we were able to observe almost all of the secondary metabolism clusters containing the reported genes or gene portions.

CONCLUSIONS
this genome-wide comparative study facilitated our understanding of the evolutionary relationships between a. westerdijkiae and other sequenced aspergillus species. the analysis of genome characteristics and evolutionary relationships provided evidence suggesting that the a. westerdijkiae genome was most closely related to the a. oryzae genome. a. westerdijkiae was capable of producing abundant plant polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and secreted proteases, and the results related to these findings in our study might serve as a basis for understanding the principles of a. westerdijkiae colonization and pathogenicity. with respect to the secondary metabolites, we identified numerous secondary biosynthetic gene clusters, including ota gene clusters and a few other clusters with predicted products. some of these gene clusters did not share similarity with any characterized biosynthetic gene clusters, indicating that a. westerdijkiae could potentially produce novel secondary metabolites. these findings set the stage for later experimental studies and might be helpful for further understanding the pathogenicity of a. westerdijkiae.
