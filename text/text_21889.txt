BACKGROUND
bacterial cells have evolved a biofilm phenotype over billions of years as part of their successful strategy to colonize biotic and abiotic surfaces when faced with different environmental conditions. biofilm consists of a biological architecture of aggregated microbes on a surface, enclosed within a mesh of exopolysaccharides, fatty acids, dna and large surface proteins  <cit> . biofilms are closely associated with persistence as the presence of the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells renders the bacteria less susceptible to anti-bacterial agents compared to free-floating cells  <cit> . as a result, biofilm infections tend to be chronic and are difficult to eradicate. the transition from free-swimming planktonic cells to biofilm producers occurs in response to environmental changes including ph, temperature, nutrient levels and ionic strength. this response involves multiple regulatory networks which translate signals to alter the reorganization of the bacterial cell to survive unfavourable conditions  <cit> . it is generally believed that quorum sensing contributes to the formation of a functioning biofilm. human infections involving biofilm have been described in patients with native valve endocarditis, cystic fibrosis, periodontitis as well as chronic bacterial infections such as prostatitis. biofilm formation in medical devices such as central venous and urinary catheters, prosthetic heart valves, intrauterine devices and contact lenses, is well described  <cit> .

burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is known to produce biofilm. a major feature of melioidosis is the difficulty in achieving complete bacterial eradication following an episode of infection and an extended period of antimicrobial treatment is needed for total clearance. formation of biofilm has been proposed as a contributory factor in the occurrence of persistent infection in the host. clinical response to antimicrobials is slow and recurrent disease is common  <cit> . sawasdidoln et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that b. pseudomallei isolates which were sensitive to doxycycline, ceftazidime, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole became resistant under conditions that promoted the formation of biofilm.

levels of humoral antibodies in patients who have had melioidosis remain high and seldom drop to basal level even years after recovery from an acute infection, supporting the notion of persistence  <cit> . it is possible that b. pseudomallei can adapt to survival in vivo through the formation of biofilm but the mechanism by which this occurs in melioidosis patients is unclear  <cit> . it has also been reported that b. pseudomallei biofilm does not contribute to the virulence of the organism  <cit> . based on studies involving various b. pseudomallei mutants, acapsular mutants may or may not have reduced formation of biofilm  <cit> . on the other hand, restricted biofilm formation was observed in the flic flagella mutant  <cit>  and the polyphosphate kinase ppk mutant  <cit>  whilst the role of b. pseudomallei cyclic-di-gmp-phosphodiesterase  in biofilm formation and virulence was established with the corresponding cdpa mutant being attenuated in human macrophage cells  <cit> . a recent report by lazar-adler et al.  <cit>  proposed the role of b. pseudomallei trimeric autotransporter adhesins  in biofilm formation whereby an insertional mutant of the bpss <dig> gene was affected in its ability to form biofilm in addition to being partially attenuated in an acute murine melioidosis model, implying a positive relationship between biofilm formation and bacterial virulence.

a number of studies involving individual mutants of the biofilm-associated genes described above have demonstrated that inactivating these single genes does not completely attenuate biofilm formation. this suggests a more global regulation of multiple b. pseudomallei genes and pathways involved in biofilm formation and may, either directly or indirectly, be related to virulence or persistence in infected hosts. hence, in this study, a comprehensive transcriptional analysis of representative high and low clinical b. pseudomallei biofilm producers was performed to identify the genes required for biofilm formation in b. pseudomallei. in addition, preliminary virulence studies of these two b. pseudomallei biofilm producers were carried out using the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and balb/c mice infection models.

RESULTS
transcriptome analysis and global transcriptional profile of b. pseudomallei biofilm strains
the sequence based transcriptome approach has been used to study regulatory mechanisms and pathogenicity factors of pseudomonas syringae  <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , listeria monocytogenes and listeria innocua  <cit> . we utilised rna sequencing and comparative transcriptome analysis to identify genes and their respective expression levels that contribute to the b. pseudomallei biofilm phenotype. a total of  <dig> b. pseudomallei clinical isolates were analysed for biofilm formation . from this collection, we selected one representative from the high biofilm producers, um <dig>  and one of the low biofilm producers, um <dig> for rna-seq analysis. the biofilm formation phenotypes of both these strains is presented in fig.  <dig>  both strains were sequenced on the illumina platform and sequence reads were mapped to the annotated b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> genome. the expression analysis demonstrated that approximately  <dig>  % of the um <dig> and um <dig> reads mapping to b. pseudomallei k <dig> genes had a calculable ‘fragments per kilobase of million fragments mapped’  value . the pattern of relative gene expression was similar between the biological replicates with a correlation coefficient of r =  <dig>  and r =  <dig>  for um <dig> and um <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig>

we next used the transcriptome data to identify genes that potentially contribute towards the biofilm phenotype in b. pseudomallei as determined by differential transcription analysis between um <dig> and um <dig>  by adopting a q-value of ≤  <dig>  and log <dig> fold-change above  <dig> to classify a transcript as being differentially expressed, transcriptional analysis revealed  <dig> differentially expressed genes  in um <dig> relative to um <dig>  functional classification of up- and down-regulated genes showed that most of these genes encode core functions such as cell envelope, central intermediary metabolism, energy metabolism, transport, regulatory proteins and cellular processes . many genes encoding proteins with unknown function or hypothetical proteins were also modulated in the high biofilm producer, um <dig> . furthermore, genes predicted to encode proteins that are known to localise as extracellular proteins were observed at a higher percentage in the group of genes with up-regulated expression . eleven genes were randomly selected from seven functional categories  for validation by quantitative real-time pcr . the expression was verified by qrt-pcr as up- or down-regulated, albeit with magnitudes different from those recorded by rna-seq . in lieu of the large number of significantly differentiated genes, only data related to genes that have some functional information are shown and discussed below.fig.  <dig>

fimbriae and pilus may be required for initiation of b. pseudomallei biofilm attachment
motility influences biofilm formation in various pathogens including enteropathogenic e. coli  <cit>  and p. aeruginosa  <cit> . a number of fimbriae and pilus-related genes  were significantly up-regulated in um <dig>  suggesting that these structures may also be important in b. pseudomallei biofilm attachment. to validate the observation of over-expressed pili-related genes, we performed scanning electron microscopy  on both strains. the micrographs  demonstrate the presence of pili protruding from um <dig> which are not observed in um <dig>  thus supporting the transcriptional-level analysis .fig.  <dig> alteration of surface composition and regulation of anaerobic respiration contribute to b. pseudomallei biofilm phenotype. transcript expression of log <dig> fold level are depicted by the histogram in the inner-most ring of the circular maps. the height of the bars correspond to the degree of expression level. genes uniquely expressed in um <dig> and um <dig> are coloured in dark red and dark green, respectively. red and green bars represent up- and down-regulation in relative expression levels, respectively. hierarchical clustering of b. pseudomallei um <dig>  and um <dig>  expression profiles according to functional categories. the heat maps indicate the gene transcripts expressed as fpkm. genes whose expression did not change are coloured in black

to gain more insight into the identified genes, we used the conserved domain database  to look at protein domains of these genes. bpsl <dig>  contains an usher superfamily domain  and papc c-terminal  and n-terminal conserved domains . concomitantly, two outer membrane usher proteins, bpss <dig>  and bpsl <dig> , were over expressed in um <dig> and may be involved in assembly of pre-pilins for fimbriae biogenesis. in contrast, a cohort of flagella-related genes encoding the flagella basal body, motor switch and hook proteins  were down-regulated in um <dig> , similar to that previously described for pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and escherichia coli biofilm formation  <cit> . the down-regulation of flagella-related genes was validated with motility assays performed on solid agar, which demonstrated that the um <dig> strain has reduced swimming and swarming motility compared to the um <dig> strain .table  <dig> swimming and swarming analysis of um <dig> and um <dig>  data are mean ± sd of two independent experiments

over expression of extracellular polymeric substance  matrix components for development of b. pseudomallei biofilm architecture
genes encoding for polysaccharides  and eps  were over-expressed in um <dig> . observations based on sem micrographs support the expression profile whereby the presence of eps matrix encapsulating the bacteria was only seen in the high biofilm producer strain um <dig> but not in the low biofilm producer strain um <dig> . attachment of gram-negative bacteria to a surface via outer membrane proteins is the first step in biofilm formation, followed by replication to form micro colonies and production of a mature biofilm  <cit> . several outer membrane and cell-surface encoded proteins were also over-expressed in um <dig>  including bpss <dig>  bpss <dig>  bpss <dig>  bpss <dig>  bpss <dig>  bpss <dig>  bpss <dig>  bpss <dig>  bpsl <dig> and bpsl <dig> .

alteration of b. pseudomallei surface composition in a high biofilm producer
expression levels of  <dig> fatty acid biosynthesis-related genes , seven phospholipases and lipase-related genes  as well as seven cell envelope biogenesis-related genes  were up-regulated in the high biofilm producer . furthermore,  <dig> lipoprotein-encoding genes  were also over-expressed in um <dig>  one of the putative lipoproteins  contained a spore coat protein u domain, scpu , which is generally present in the bacterial family of secreted pili proteins involved in motility and biofilm formation. concomitantly, three putative scpu domain containing export protein genes, bpsl <dig> , bpsl <dig>  and bpsl <dig> , were also identified as over-expressed in um <dig> .

luxr-like domain is likely to be involved in b. pseudomallei biofilm formation
quorum sensing  is a form of cell to cell communication that bacteria adopt to coordinate group behaviour in a cell density dependent manner. qs relies on n-acyl homoserine lactones  to regulate gene expression in response to cell density dependent cues and is related to biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide production  <cit> . in addition, qs influences the expression profile of diverse genes including antibiotic tolerance and virulence determinants  <cit> . the qs system plays a major role in the control of bacterial biofilm formation in many known pathogens including p. aeruginosa  <cit> , streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit> . in this study, the expression levels of homoserine o-acetyltransferase  and the luxr-family transcriptional regulator , which, together mediate gene expression following association with the cognate ahl , were up-regulated in um <dig> .

up-regulation of two component signal transduction systems and stress proteins in the b. pseudomallei high biofilm producer
the two component signal  transduction system related proteins, a sensor histidine kinase protein and response regulator, are responsible in regulating biofilm formation in a number of bacteria. several genes related to the two-component signal transduction systems  were up-regulated in um <dig> . interestingly, two putative sensor kinases  demonstrated considerable similarity to the e. coli rcsc sensor protein, particularly at the conserved domains .

four genes encoding response regulators  that contained a luxr-like domain  were identified as up-regulated in um <dig> . amongst the identified genes, a hypothetical protein  containing the cpxp component domain , was up-regulated by  <dig>  fold. proteins containing the cpx component domain are known modulators of cell-envelope stress in gram-negative bacteria including e. coli biofilm-producing cells  <cit> . in addition, genes encoding two universal stress proteins  and one hypothetical protein  with a universal stress protein family domain  as well as genes of three stress–related proteins  were also up-regulated in um <dig> 

modulation of the denitrification enzyme pathway in the b. pseudomallei high biofilm producer
two anaerobic-related genes , three reductase genes involved in nitrate metabolism  and several genes encoding fumarate and the nitrate reduction  subfamily were over expressed in um <dig> . the majority of these genes encode for proteins involved in nitrate regulation and dissimilation including nitrate reductases , nitrate-oxide reductase , nitrate sensor protein  and nitrate extrusion proteins  . of interest, two nitrite extrusion proteins and a transport-related membrane protein  contain the major facilitator superfamily  domain , which is involved in the symport, antiport or uniport pumping of various substrates such as sugars, oligosaccharides and antibiotics  <cit> . moreover, one of the crp-family transcriptional regulators  contained the effector domain of the cap family transcription factor  whilst two hypothetical proteins  that also contained the same domain, were up regulated  in um <dig> compared to um <dig>  up-regulation of mfs-containing genes has recently been associated with the development of biofilm by p. aeruginosa  <cit>  as well as adherence and biofilm formation for acinetobacter baumannii  <cit> .

potential correlation between b. pseudomallei biofilm formation and virulence in nematode and mice models
biofilm formation has been implicated as a virulence factor in c. elegans infection models for yersinia pseudotuberculosis  <cit>  and staphylococcal infections  <cit> . hence, we used the c. elegans host model to evaluate virulence of the different b. pseudomallei biofilm producers and determine the contribution of biofilm in b. pseudomallei-mediated killing of c. elegans. nematodes were fed with b. pseudomallei um <dig>  and um <dig> , respectively, and the non-pathogenic b. thailandensis atcc  <dig>  <cit> . as shown in fig. 5a, worms exposed to the laboratory food source e. coli op <dig> remained completely viable over the course of the experiment. worms exposed to um <dig> died significantly faster  test p <  <dig> ) with a mean time to death  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h compared to worms exposed to b. thailandensis  and um <dig> . the preliminary survival/virulence assay demonstrates that b. pseudomallei biofilm production could be a contributing virulence factor in the pathogenesis of this bacterium.fig.  <dig> 
b. pseudomallei biofilm may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis. a
b. pseudomallei biofilm contributes towards lethality in c. elegans. one-day old glp worms were transferred to individual b. pseudomallei isolates um <dig> , um <dig> , b. thailandensis atcc  <dig>  and e. coli op <dig> . the graph shows the mean ± sd of three replicates  from a representative of two independent experiments. b mice  were challenged intraperitonealy with a lethal dose of b. pseudomallei um <dig>  or um <dig>  and their survival was monitored. mice challenged with um <dig> succumbed to disease significantly faster  than those challenged with um <dig> . c the bacterial loads in the spleen, liver and lung of b. pseudomallei-infected mice are shown. each symbol represents one mouse. the horizontal line indicates the geometry mean for each group. significance was determined using the mann–whitney test . representative colony morphologies of b. pseudomallei um <dig> and um <dig> harvested from the infected mice organs are shown. d
b. pseudomallei um <dig> attenuates production of various cytokines. lungs of balb/c mice challenged with b. pseudomallei um <dig> or um <dig> were harvested and the levels of  <dig> pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured by the mouse cytokine multi-analyte elisarray kit . cytokine expression is shown as fold increase compared to the control unchallenged mice



balb/c mice serve as a well-established animal model for melioidosis. to confirm the findings in c. elegans, mice were challenged intraperitoneally with a lethal dose of um <dig> or um <dig> and mice survival was monitored. as observed in c. elegans, mice infected with um <dig> died significantly faster than those infected with um <dig> . all mice infected with um <dig> succumbed to disease within 24 h with a median survival of 1 day while only  <dig> mouse infected with um <dig> died on day one and the remaining  <dig> mice succumbed to disease on day  <dig> with a median survival of 3 days. although um <dig> appeared to be more virulent, bacterial loads in the lungs and livers of um <dig> and um1-infected mice were similar, and the spleens of um <dig> infected mice displayed a significantly lower bacterial count compared to um <dig> infected mice .

the high biofilm producer was able to kill both mice and nematode relatively quickly suggesting an imbalance between the host proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses towards infection. hence, we asked if the presence of the biofilm deregulated this equilibrium by limiting the cytokine response to infection. to address this question, the mouse cytokine multi-analyte elisarray kit  was utilised to simultaneously measure  <dig> cytokines i.e., il-1α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-17a, interferon-γ , tumour necrosis factor-α , granulocyte- colony stimulating factor  and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor . we observed a significant attenuation in the levels of all  <dig> cytokines within the lungs of mice infected with um <dig> compared to lungs from mice infected with um <dig> . in summary, we propose that high levels of biofilm production attenuate the cytokine response which may explain the increased virulence of b. pseudomallei um <dig> 

a similar gene expression profile is observed in other b. pseudomallei high and low biofilm producing strains
the transcriptional data presented here have identified genes that most likely contribute towards the biofilm phenotype in b. pseudomallei. to confirm that the observed gene expression pattern is not restricted to um <dig> and um <dig>  we selected a second high biofilm producing strain  as well as a low b. pseudomallei biofilm producing strain, um <dig>  to analyse the expression profile. seven of  <dig> genes that were modulated in um <dig>  were analysed, including genes associated with the denitrification pathway, cell envelope and eps production. six of the selected genes were also over-expressed in um <dig> compared to um <dig> . both isolates were also analysed in c. elegans  and mice  infection assays and we observed that the high biofilm b. pseudomallei strain um <dig> contributed to higher killing kinetics in both animal models.fig.  <dig> the b. pseudomallei high biofilm producer, um <dig>  also results in faster killing kinetics and over-expression of biofilm-associated genes compared to a second low biofilm producing isolate, um <dig>  a biofilm index of um <dig> and um <dig>  b qrt-pcr analysis of b. pseudomallei genes from seven functional categories differentially expressed by rna-seq analysis. the results are from a representative of three reproducible independent experiments. c killing assay of c. elegans infected with um <dig> , um <dig>  and b. thailandensis . the graph shows the mean ± sd of three replicates  from a representative of two independent experiments. d mice  were challenged intraperitonealy with a lethal dose of b. pseudomallei um <dig>  or um <dig>  and their survival was monitored. mice challenged with um <dig> succumbed to disease significantly faster  than those challenged with um <dig> 



discussion
b. pseudomallei biofilm formation may contribute to intracellular survival, dormancy and antibiotic resistance  <cit>  but the mechanism by which this occurs in humans is yet to be demonstrated  <cit> . to date, only a handful of b. pseudomallei biofilm-associated genes have been studied and have mainly focused on single-gene phenotypes. in this study, we demonstrate that biofilm production is a complex process that involves the differential expression of several genes. rna sequencing analysis performed on low and high biofilm-producing b. pseudomallei strains identified genes that contribute to biofilm formation. we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes during the formation and growth of biofilm, accounting for about  <dig>  % of the total b. pseudomallei gene content. the transciptome analysis of biofilm related genes was performed on mid-log bacterial cultures, the pre-biofilm state, to conform to standard sequencing protocols. keeping in mind that our analysis may not necessarily reflect a true biofilm environment, we subsequently analysed a subset of genes from  <dig> representative functional groups on um <dig> and um <dig> cells grown to the stationary phase . qrt-pcr analysis demonstrated comparable magnitudes and patterns of gene expression between rna samples extracted from cells at different growth phases . thus, our findings offer new insights into the different transcriptional landscapes observed between clinical b. pseudomallei high and low biofilm producing isolates.

biofilm producing pathogens sense environmental signals via the tcs transduction system and adapt to these changes by transcribing genes that planktonic organisms do not  <cit> . based on the expression profile of the high biofilm producer, we hypothesise that b. pseudomallei also responds to varied environmental signals, for instance ph, temperature, osmotic pressure and oxygen concentration via activation of various tcs . upon encountering the environmental cues that stress the cell membranes, b. pseudomallei most likely activates the rcsb-rcsc tcs and subsequently regulates genes that encode proteins involved in the alteration of surface components, including capsular polysaccharides, cell envelop biogenesis, lipoproteins, phospolipases and fatty acid biosynthesis that are pivotal for survival of b. pseudomallei within the host . rcsc sensor kinase is required for biofilm formation in e. coli and regulates genes encoding for proteins that are either localised to the envelope or have activities that affect the structure/properties of the bacterial surface  <cit> . in addition, the cell-to-cell communication small fatty acid signal molecule, diffusible signal factor , regulates the expression of factors contributing to virulence, antibiotic tolerance and biofilm formation  <cit> . dsf is synthesized by putative enoyl-coa hydratase and putative acyl-coa ligase in xanthomonas campestris and burkholderia cecocepacia . three fatty acid biosynthesis genes that encode for co-a hydratase and ligase are up-regulated in um <dig>  this, in turn, most likely regulates eps-associated genes, the core component for maintenance of biofilm architecture and pilus biogenesis-related genes to initiate the attachment of planktonic cells for microcolony formation.fig.  <dig> summary of b. pseudomallei genes that contribute to biofilm development. a in response to varied environmental signals, b. pseudomallei regulates the two-component signal  transduction system to adapt to environmental changes, by  transcribing genes that encode proteins involved in the alteration of surface components and components crucial to initiate attachment of planktonic bacterial cells to solid surfaces for microcolony formation. as the biofilm grows, an oxygen-limited environment forms. c the high biofilm producing b. pseudomallei strain utilises nitrate for anaerobic growth through the denitrification enzyme pathway. arrow represents activator connection; solid lines represent direct activation; dashed lines represent indirect activation. the boxes and fonts highlighted in red depict the up-regulated biological processes and genes, respectively, while the box highlighted in green depicts the down-regulated biological processes



during the growth of micro colonies, methyl- accepting chemotaxis protein mcp , a sensor protein in tcs, is up-regulated in um <dig> and subsequently suppresses the regulation of cheb which is responsible for flagella switch . down regulation of the flagella biosynthesis cascade seen in the high biofilm producer  suggests sessile transition of motile b. pseudomallei for biofilm development  <cit> . bacterial biofilm formation is known to affect colony morphotype   <cit>  and bacterial attachment  <cit> . this is also true for b. pseudomallei biofilm, whereby the low biofilm producer um <dig> that exhibits a mucoid colony morphotype, has lower expression levels of pilus, fimbriae, lipoprotein, polysaccharide and eps-related genes when compared to the wrinkled colony morphotype observed in um <dig> . this observation is similar to a p. aeruginosa mutant with a wrinkled colony phenotype capable of forming pronounced pellicles that exhibited increased production of exopolysaccharide and eps  <cit> .

recently, the crp/fnr superfamily protein bcam <dig> of burkholderia cenocepacia  was reported as a cyclic diguanosine monophosphate  effector in regulating biofilm formation and is involved in virulence  <cit> . this protein regulates the increased production of cellulose and fimbriae  <cit> . two hypothetical proteins  with the crp/fnr superfamily conserved domain were significantly up-regulated in um <dig> . protein sequence analysis revealed that bpsl <dig> has 69 % identity to bcam <dig>  suggesting that it is the ortholog of the bcc bcam <dig> . of note, the neighboring genes of these two hypothetical proteins were also up- regulated and a number of these genes are involved in surface protein modification . another member of the crp/fnr family protein, the c-di-gmp response regulator clpb heat-shock protein  is also up-regulated in um <dig>  furthermore, a cohort of fimbriae related genes, including three chaperone-usher gene clusters  which make up the chaperone-usher fimbriae pathway  were also over expressed in um <dig> . up-regulation of fimbriae genes in biofilm formation seen in this study are similar to that in klebsiella pneumoniae  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit>  which promotes adhesion to abiotic surfaces. in addition, p. aeruginosa fimbrial cupe/csu proteins that contain the scpu sub-domain are reportedly involved in structuring of biofilm  <cit> . concomitantly, three hypothetical proteins with the conserved scpu domain  up-regulated in the high biofilm producer may likely play a role in b. pseudomallei biofilm formation.

as the micro colonies mature into a progressively thick biofilm, a nutrient and oxygen-limited environment forms  <cit>  and the anaerobic fitness of the pathogen is pivotal for survival in the biofilm  <cit> . p. aeruginosa uses nitrate as an alternate electron acceptor through a denitrification enzyme pathway during the anaerobic growth of biofilm  <cit>  and this is regulated by anr, an ortholog of the e. coli fnr  <cit> . this transcriptional profiling suggests that the high b. pseudomallei biofilm producer may sense oxygen limitation through the narx/narl tcs and subsequently activate the nitrate reductase operon  and several types of nitrate reductases. this suggests that the facultative anaerobe b. pseudomallei is also likely to utilise nitrate for anaerobic growth in biofilm through the denitrification pathway regulated by bpsl <dig> . to our knowledge, this is the first report that describes the involvement of the tcs and denitrification enzyme pathways within the anaerobic environment in b. pseudomallei biofilm development.

biofilm formation in other pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae has been reported to be associated with altered host immune responses  <cit> . our preliminary study suggests that b. pseudomallei biofilm is probably a contributing factor towards virulence in both c. elegans and balb/c mice models . furthermore, um <dig>  the high biofilm producer strain failed to elicit the expected cytokine response even though the number of recoverable cfu was similar for the two strains . many inflammatory cytokines referred to as the “core host immune response” molecules commonly seen in general inflammation infections including melioidosis  <cit> , were not over expressed in um <dig> infected-mice. this attenuation of in vivo inflammation suggests that intracellular b. pseudomallei are camouflaged from the host immune defense response by the biofilm causing the host to succumb to the infection. although our findings challenge the previous report by taiweechaisupapong et al.  <cit> , both studies are limited by the small number  of isolates to conclude a positive or negative association between b. pseudomallei biofilm formation and virulence and the analysis of a larger b. pseudomallei strain cohort should be undertaken.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this is the first report of the complete transcriptome profile of a b. pseudomallei biofilm producer. we have identified genes that are likely involved in the development of the b. pseudomallei biofilm phenotype, including quorum sensing, motility and surface composition-related genes . interestingly, many of these genes are clustered together in the genome and may be regulated as an operon . we postulate that the ability to sense various environmental cues and adapt to anaerobic conditions via the denitrification enzyme pathway is pivotal for the formation of b. pseudomallei biofilm in the infected host which subsequently allows for persistent infection in chronic melioidosis. b. pseudomallei is particularly recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment and this is most likely attributable to biofilm formation. thus, novel strategies designed to thwart b. pseudomallei biofilm formation or to block a specific biofilm developmental stage, such as the use of anti-adhesion agents and inhibitors which interfere with signal transduction, are exciting avenues for the development of potent and bioavailable treatment strategies.
