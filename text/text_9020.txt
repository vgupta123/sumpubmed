BACKGROUND
the adrenal medulla plays a key role in the response to acute and chronic stress. it is the major site of biosynthesis of epinephrine  in the periphery. upon exposure to stress, the release of adrenomedullary epi and norepinephrine  are among the most rapid response to handle the emergency situation. this is crucial for activation of the “fight or flight” response to deal with a threat to homeostasis.

when stress is prolonged or repeated the adrenal medulla exhibits crucial adaptive and subsequently maladaptive responses. these include important changes in gene expression. the best characterized are the up-regulation of expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes . exposure to single immobilization stress triggers a manifold elevation in transcription and expression of mrnas of the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase , the first and major rate limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis as well as of phenylethanolamine n-methyltransferase , the enzyme which catalyses the conversion of ne to epi  <cit> – <cit> . this rise is transient and returns to normal within one day and is not sufficient for substantial increase in their activity. following repeated imo stress the increase in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes is now more sustained with prolonged elevation in catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme activity .

to determine the repertoire of changes and the mechanism of alterations in gene expression mediating the response of adrenal medulla to single and repeated stress, microarray profiling was performed  <cit> . following single exposure to 2 hr imo stress there was altered expression, of greater than  <dig> fold, in nearly 4% of the total transcripts. transcription factors and cell signaling genes displayed the most prevalent changes. approximately 20% of the transcripts up-regulated by single imo were transcription factors. not only was egr <dig> mrna markedly induced in the adrenal medulla by single as well as repeated exposure to imo, but pathway analysis indicated that egr <dig> likely plays a central role  <cit> .

egr <dig>  is a transcription factor with three zinc fingers of the cys2his <dig> class . egr <dig> binds to a gc-rich motif  gggcg-3′) through its three zinc finger dna binding domains  <cit>  and modulates transcription of a number of genes that participate in various cellular functions . egr <dig> plays critical roles in divergent cellular processes. for example, egr <dig> and stat <dig> have been implicated in neuronal differentiation, specifically during neurite outgrowth .

egr <dig> target genes include catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes. transcription of both th and pnmt is up-regulated by egr <dig>  <cit> – <cit> . we have previously shown that egr <dig> is markedly induced in the adrenal medulla by imo stress  <cit> . while barely expressed under basal conditions, immunofluorescence demonstrated widespread expression in the nucleus of th expressing chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla after imo stress  <cit> . however the molecules that form the core of the signaling cascade inducing these responses are not well understood. because complex biological behaviors arise from the coordinated behavior of sets of genes acting in concert , we hypothesized that genes that are co-expressed with egr <dig> during single or repeated imo stress might provide insights into to significant signaling pathways that participate in stress signaling. here we employed gene set enrichment analysis to identify egr <dig> co-expressed genes from imo microarrays, extracted their interactors and all their interrelationships and reconstructed egr <dig> networks. from their network properties, we have identified the transcription factor stat <dig> and the peptide prlh <dig> in short and prolonged stress respectively as egr <dig> neighbors in the adrenal medulla implicating them for the first time in stress signaling.

RESULTS
 <dig>  gene sets that enrich with egr <dig> expression in acute and repeated stress
Αcute and repeated stress responses are accompanied by different patterns of gene expression, particularly of transcription factor genes, suggesting an interplay of transcription factors and the gene programs they control. in order to identify novel genes and their products that might be instrumental in networks leading from acute to repeated stress, we applied a strategy  that allowed us the re-construction of egr1-centered networks and the extraction of network neighbors from expression profiles identical to that of egr <dig>  we executed this strategy in two steps: first, we used kolmogorov-smirnov analysis of acute  and repeated  imo microarray expression data in order to rank expression levels of all genes in the microarrays. second we used gene set enrichment analysis  and computed gene module enrichment scores  for each module of genes that are either co-expressed with egr <dig>  or anti-coexpressed  . specifically, using egr <dig> as an index gene in gsea we extracted the top fifty genes  that are co-expression neighbors of egr <dig> . second, by categorical class analysis  we extracted the top fifty down-regulated genes and top fifty up-regulated genes in control and in 1× samples. we repeated the same analyses for 6× imo data. third, we extracted the top negatively correlated genes from the top gene sets . finally, we mined a list of  <dig> rat genes from the coxpresdb database reported to be co-expressed with egr <dig> .

 <dig>  extraction of all ppis/interrelationships and reconstruction of egr1-centered networks
in the next step of our strategy we combined the three previously discussed gene/protein lists and extracted all genetic and physical interactions and then we text-mined all published interrelationships from public databases with statistical tools that are incorporated within the websites, using an expectation value  greater than  <dig> . we verified that data reflected real interrelationships and rejected data that were mere co-incidences of textual referral. thus, interaction data with an e value less than  <dig>  were rejected .

 <dig>  re-construction of 1× and 6× imo stress networks
in the final step of our strategy we re-constructed 1× and 6× networks as described . the 1× network contains  <dig> genes/proteins  and  <dig> interactions  and is whereas the 6× contains  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges. it can be seen that the network parameters of 1× and 6× networks are similar to the parameters of other biological networks such as the yeast proteome or the human htfn however, they are quite dissimilar to random er networks . we then re-displayed networks 1× and 6× around egr <dig> and extracted the egr <dig> network neighborhoods  within the hubba website by calculating the intersection between egr <dig> and top hub and bottleneck nodes . notably, the 1× network is organized around egr <dig>  a result consistent with the central role of this transcription factor in acute stress, and also around stat <dig>  which is a novel observation . in contrast, while egr <dig> remains, as expected, a top hub in the 6× network, the other top hubs in this network, apoa <dig> and hspd <dig> are not neighbors of egr <dig>  suggesting that the egr <dig> neighborhood is organized differently . in order to further analyze egr1’s network neighbors in 1× and 6× networks, and infer possible links between them and egr <dig> we extracted the top  <dig> motifs of interacting proteins with the mcode algorithm within cytoscape and identified top go functional classifications and kegg pathways with the gather algorithm for nodes in the neighborhood of egr <dig>  the egr1-centered, 1× imo network neighborhood motifs are enriched for cell cycle, mapk kinase and cytokine pathways, consistent with their role in acute stress , whereas the 6× egr1-centered network motifs is enriched for purine metabolism, insulin signaling, mapk and the neuroactive signaling pathways .

we further narrowed our focus on the shortest path neighbors of egr <dig> within the top motifs in both acute and repeated stress. egr <dig> and stat <dig> also are top bottlenecks as well as network neighbors in the 1× network and they are in motif  <dig> . calculation of shortest paths in the neighborhood of egr1within the hubba website revealed that stat <dig> is a network neighbor of egr <dig>  and additional file  <dig>  see “top hubs” sheet). also, egr <dig> is a top hub in 6× imo samples, and is a member of motif  <dig> along with prlh and chgb . few of the other nodes in other motifs were of sufficient interest for further functional analysis. we therefore extracted the intersection between top hubs and/bottlenecks and motif  <dig> members  within hubba by calculating the shortest path between top hubs/bottlenecks and members of motif  <dig> which also contained egr <dig> as well . notably, among egr1’s neighbors, expression of prlh and chgb were also up-regulated but not that of creb .

gene ontology analysis of 1× network motifs and the egr1/stat <dig> neighborhood showed that it is enriched for cell cycle, cell proliferation and cytokine-cytokine receptor  and jak/stat pathway genes  whereas 6× network motifs are enriched for genes belonging to the insulin signaling, neuroactive signaling and the purine metabolism pathways. prlh <dig> is a network neighbor of egr <dig> . strikingly, the mapk signaling pathway is enriched for genes in all motifs except  <dig> and  <dig>  an observation that is consistent with previous results. this finding is consistent with a role of the erk-stat3-egr <dig> pathway in neurite outgrowth. specifically, mek-erk1/ <dig> is required for fgf1-induced neurite outgrowth, pstat <dig>  and egr <dig> expression in pc <dig> cells  <cit> .

in order to confirm our findings, we tested independent samples of 1× and 6× egr <dig> network neighbors for expression changes with qrt-pcr or immunoblots . several of these changes were further verified in independent imo stress samples at the mrna level by qrt-pcr or at the protein level by western blot analysis or immunocytochemistry . these findings confirm for the first time that stat  <dig> expression  is significantly up-regulated with 1× imo. expression of prlh <dig>  is up-regulated in both 1× and in 6× . strikingly, we observed for the first time down regulation of gene pias <dig>  implicating stat <dig> signaling in acute imo stress activation. pias <dig> is a small e3-type small ubiquitin-like modifier  ligase that plays a critical role in regulating the stat <dig> signaling pathway by inhibiting stat3-dna binding  <cit> , <cit> . the egr <dig> neighbors prlh <dig>  are significantly represented in changes in the 6× imo samples, suggesting that they might have important functions in long-term stress signaling .

discussion
we have sought to identify novel members in pathways, particularly transcription factor pathways, and gene products that might be regulated in imo stress. we approached this by performing microarray analyses of samples derived from the adrenal medullae of rats subjected to acute  or repeated  imo stress in order to identify genes/gene products that are co-expressed or co-regulated with the transcription factor egr <dig>  which is critical for stress responses in the adrenal medulla of rats. following identification of gene modules that are co-expressed with egr <dig> with ks ranking and gsea analysis, we mined all physiologically relevant interactions and interrelationships with text-mining, and we established that stat <dig> and prlh are significantly up-regulated in 1× and in 6× imo stress responses suggesting for the first time that they are likely participants. also, we confirmed earlier observations that chgb is activated in 6× imo stress  <cit> . stat <dig> is co-expressed and a network neighbor of egr <dig> in the re-constructed 1× network, implicating stat <dig> involvement in imo stress. notably, the 1× network is organized around egr <dig> and stat <dig> since they are top hubs . this contention is supported by the concomitant down-regulation of the stat <dig> inhibitor pias <dig> which inhibits the dna activity of stat <dig> therefore shutting down part of stat3-mediated genomic expression changes. the observed enrichment for mapk and cytokine genes in 1× imo stress  is consistent with the involvement of cytokines in regulating the stress response. stat <dig> belongs to the stat  family of transcription factors that feed into the jak/stat signaling cascade. several cytokine receptors regulate this cascade and this is consistent with the observed go enrichment for cytokine receptors. stats are phosphorylated by jaks and activated, allowing them to translocate to the nucleus. the jak/stat pathway is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by kinase/phosphatase enzymes, by stat gene activation antagonists such as socs  and by pias   <cit> , <cit> .

prlh <dig> is a peptide widely distributed in the cns and involved in mediating stress responses and activating the hpa axis  <cit> . prlh <dig> was found to be co-expressed with th and pnmt in epi synthesizing cells of the adrenal medulla  <cit> , however its function in the adrenal is unclear.

in repeated stress , the egr1-centered network is organized differently with stat <dig> being absent and with prlh and chgb being close network neighbors of egr <dig> . moreover, the enriched motifs are strikingly different compared to the 1× egr <dig> neighborhoods. the predominant motifs include members of the insulin signaling pathway and members of pathways for purine metabolism, neuroactive signaling and mapk pathway. the latter observation is in agreement with the central role of the mapk pathway in both acute and repeated stress responses. chgb is up-regulated confirming previous experiments . induction of chromogranin b  gene expression selectively with 6× imo stress but not with 1×, is especially intriguing since chgb functions in the biogenesis of secretory granules and in the sorting of proteins to the regulated secretory pathway  <cit> . chgb deficient mice display reduced levels of catecholamines released per quanta  <cit> . the induction of chgb with repeated imo suggests formation of additional neurosecretory vesicles or production of larger quantal release which may help provide additional neurosecretory strength to adapt to further demands of chronically repeated stress  <cit> . the induction of chgb with repeated imo suggests that formation of additional neurosecretory vesicles or production of larger quantal release may help provide additional neurosecretory strength to adapt to further demands of chronically repeated stress.

CONCLUSIONS
in addition to the transcription factor egr <dig> which is critical for imo stress induction in the rat adrenal medulla, we here provide evidence for the first time that the gene encoding the transcription factor stat <dig> and the gene encoding the peptide prlh <dig> are activated in acute  and in repeated stress  respectively. the data suggest that the transcription factor egr <dig> has different roles in acute and in repeated stress, indicated by different networks and network neighbors and furthermore that stat <dig> signaling in 1× and prlh  activation cascades in 6× might also be important in transitioning from acute to repeated stress responses.
