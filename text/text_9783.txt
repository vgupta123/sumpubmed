BACKGROUND
conifers  are a large group of gymnosperm trees which are separated from the angiosperms by more than  <dig> million years of independent evolution. the conifers include the economically and ecologically important species of spruce  and pine , which dominate many of the world's natural and planted forests  <cit> . the development of genomic resources for conifers has focused on the discovery and characterization of expressed genes in the form of expressed sequence tags  and full-length cdnas. the available conifer cdna sequence resources are extensive , representing almost 9% of all ests in the plant genome database . the est and flcdna resources developed for white spruce , sitka spruce , and a hybrid white spruce   <cit> , have enabled transcriptome profiling  <cit> , proteome analysis  <cit> , marker development  <cit> , and the functional characterization of gene products  <cit> . these functional genomics studies have provided considerable insights into conifer defence against insects and pathogens, adaptation to the environment, and development  <cit> .

beyond the characterization of cdnas and their encoded proteins, the lack of a gymnosperm reference genome sequence limits our knowledge of the organization, structure and gene space of conifer genomes. sequencing a conifer genome has not yet been attempted and will remain a daunting task, given that conifer genomes range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> gbp, which is  <dig> - 400-fold larger than the genome of arabidopsis and larger than any other genome sequenced to date. the sequencing of a conifer genome may also be challenging due to a very high content of repetitive dna  <cit>  and the tendency of conifers to out-cross, preventing the development of inbred strains. an important step in assessing the feasibility of conifer genome sequencing will be the isolation, in random or targeted fashion, of genomic dna in the form of bac clones, followed by the sequencing and assembly of large segments of gdna. however, to the best of our knowledge, sequencing of a complete bac clone or any large segment of nuclear gdna has not yet been reported in the literature for a conifer or any other gymnosperm species. recently, a loblolly pine  gdna bac library was used to assess the contribution of a novel pine-specific retrotransposon family  to conifer genome size  <cit> .

unlike in angiosperms, conifers are not thought to have undergone recent genome duplication events  <cit> . however, two features of conifer genomes pose untested challenges for the targeted isolation and sequence assembly of bacs containing genes of interest involved in conifer defence. first, many conifer defence genes exist as closely related members of large families. for example, genes encoding the oleoresin producing terpenoid synthases   <cit> , cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  involved in diterpene resin acid formation   <cit> , tir-nbs-lrr disease resistance proteins  <cit> , pathogenesis-related - <dig> proteins  <cit> , and dirigent proteins  <cit>  are members of such multigene families. against the background of large gene families it may be difficult to isolate bacs for a specific target gene. second, the abundance of transposable elements , specifically those of the copia and gypsy classes, which have been demonstrated by in situ hybridizations as diverse families of retroelements across conifer chromosomes  <cit> , may cause additional problems with genome sequence assemblies.

in this paper we report a successful strategy for the targeted bac identification and isolation of tps and p <dig> genes using pcr-based screening of a non-arrayed white spruce bac library of 3x genome coverage, and the subsequent gdna insert sequencing, sequence assembly, and sequence characterization. when extended to other conifers, our strategy will enable a comparative analysis of synteny of specific target regions of conifer genomes.

RESULTS
targeted isolation of bac clones containing tps  and p <dig>  genes
our first objective was to test if individual bac clones containing conifer genes of large gene families could be isolated in a gene-specific manner. a white spruce  gdna bac library of approximately 3x genome coverage was constructed, aliquoted into pools in ten 96-well plates, and screened in a hierarchical fashion by pcr as described previously  <cit> . the primers used to screen pooled bac clones for a specific tps gene were based on the functionally characterized norway spruce  and sitka spruce 3-carene synthase flcdnas  . primers used to screen for a specific target p <dig> gene were based on the functionally characterized diterpene oxidase cyp720b <dig> from sitka spruce and its white spruce orthologue . the function of the spruce cyp720b <dig> gene is similar to that of loblolly pine cyp720b <dig> in diterpene resin acid formation  <cit> . primers used for gene-specific screening for tps - or p <dig> -containing bac clones were assessed in silico against other known members of the large conifer tps-d family  <cit>  and other members of the conifer-specific cyp720b family  <cit> , respectively, to minimize the chance of isolating non-target members of these gene families.

from a total of  <dig> bac pools , which were initially screened as  <dig> super-pools  we identified  <dig> and  <dig> pools that yielded pcr products with the 3car and cyp720b <dig> primers, respectively. the  <dig> independent pcr products obtained with 3car primers represented four unique 3car-like sequences with at least 95% identity  amongst each other and to the sitka spruce 3car flcdna q <dig> . we also sequenced five independent pcr products obtained by screening the bac pools with cyp720b <dig> primers. all five sequences were 100% identical with the target cyp720b <dig> sequence. for each of the two target genes, a single individual bac clone was isolated, verified by sequencing the pcr product, and the gdna inserts were excised and their size estimated based upon their mobility in pulsed field gel electrophoresis. the bac clone pgb <dig>  contained a gdna insert of approximately  <dig> kbp and bac clone pgb <dig>  contained an insert of approximately  <dig> kbp. these gdna inserts were sheared into fragments of  <dig> -  <dig> bp and shotgun-subcloned into plasmid libraries for sequencing.

automated sequence assemblies of pgb <dig> and pgb04
the shotgun plasmid libraries for pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> were arrayed in 384-well plates. plasmid inserts from ten and five 384-well plates were sanger-sequenced for pgb <dig> and pgb <dig>  respectively, resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig>  paired sequence reads . the average plasmid insert length was  <dig>  bp for the pgb <dig> library and  <dig>  bp for the pgb <dig> library. sequences were scanned and masked for vector sequences and contaminating bacterial sequences, eliminating  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total sequences. using phrap, we assembled the sequences into  <dig> contigs for pgb <dig> and  <dig> contigs for pgb <dig>  for pgb <dig>  the two largest contigs assembled in this automated fashion covered a total length of  <dig>  bp ; the three largest contigs for pgb <dig> covered over  <dig>  bp  .

manual curation of the sequence assemblies of pgb <dig> and pgb04
to improve the assembly of pgb <dig> and pgb <dig>  we inspected each contig generated with the phrap software. we found that chimeric sequences, resulting from the ligation of independent gdna fragments during the production of shotgun plasmid libraries, were included in some of the plasmid insert sequences, which together with low-quality sequences and low-complexity repeats, prevented the automated assembly into continuous sequence. in addition, we manually aligned shorter contigs with low sequence representation to the larger contigs. the left and right arms of the pindigobac- <dig> vector, which were subcloned together with the gdna inserts into the plasmid shotgun libraries, provided orientation for the scaffolds of pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> .

the final assembly of pgb <dig> contained two contigs separated by a short gap  without sequence coverage. the gap is flanked by long stretches of low-complexity repeat sequence. it is likely that the sequence gap resulted from physical repeat structures  which interfered with sequencing this region. manual curation resulted in a single complete contig for the pgb <dig> gdna. in pgb <dig> two high-complexity repeats and several low-complexity repeats extend for over  <dig> kbp on either side of a region of approximately  <dig> bp with low sequence coverage  .

in summary, the combined automated and manual sequence assemblies resulted in two contigs for pgb <dig> with a combined sequence length of  <dig>  bp and  <dig> × sequence coverage, and into a single contigs for pgb <dig> with a sequence length of  <dig>  bp and  <dig> × sequence coverage. the size of the assembled sequence contigs for pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> agree well with the size of bac inserts as estimated by pfge .

in silico analysis of the effect of sequencing depth on assembly quality
using the high sequence coverage  and high-quality manually curated sequence assembly  for pgb <dig> we analyzed the effect of plasmid shotgun library sequencing depth on the quality of the automated assembly. this assessment can guide cost-effective sequencing of bac clones for future efforts of conifer genome sequencing. the sequences obtained from the plasmids of five 384-well plates for pgb <dig> were assembled into independent builds in all permutations of two, three, four or five plates . with sequences obtained from one plate, an average coverage of  <dig> × was obtained and the number of nucleotides assembled into contigs  was less than  <dig> kbp . by assembling sequences from two plates, the coverage doubled to an average of  <dig> ×, the number of contigs  was reduced, the assembly included over  <dig> kbp in contigs, and the full length scaffold had over 98% coverage relative to the reference pgb <dig> assembly. when sequences from three, four or five plates were used in the assembly, coverage increased to  <dig> ×,  <dig> × and 16×, respectively, with a further increase in the number of nucleotides assembled. the assembly of sequences from three, four or five plates also resulted in an increase of the number of contigs. even with five plates, the coverage obtained by automated assembly never reached 100% relative to the pgb <dig> reference assembly, which involved manual curation.

gene content of pgb <dig> and pgb04
results from the overall sequence analyses of the bac clones pgb <dig> and pgb <dig>  visualised using gbrowse, are available as online information at http://treenomix <dig> msl.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/gbrowse/pgb02/; http://treenomix <dig> msl.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/gbrowse/pgb04/ . these descriptions include blast annotations , gc content and gene predictions . pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> each contained a single functional gene identified by blast searches, which match the target genes 3car  and cyp720b <dig>  . relative to the complete gdna sequence length of pgb <dig> and pgb <dig>  the gene density with a single gene per  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp, respectively, is at least 10-fold lower than the overall gene density of the sequenced genomes of arabidopsis, rice, poplar and grapevine . the gc content  of the two white spruce gdnas was lower than the gc content of the rice genome  and higher than those of the arabidopsis , poplar , and grapevine  genomes   <cit> .

analyses of the gdna sequences for 3car and cyp720b4
the genomic region of the 3car gene on pgb <dig> covers  <dig>  bp, including a  <dig> bp 5'-utr and  <dig> bp 3'-utr which are part of the corresponding transcript isolated from cdna . the gene contains ten exons and nine introns, with intronic regions accounting for  <dig> % of the gene sequence between the start and stop codon of this tps gene. the genomic region of the cyp720b <dig> gene on pgb <dig> covers  <dig>  bp over nine exons  and eight introns and includes transcribed 5'- and 3'-utrs of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively . the intronic region covers 50% of the gene sequence between the start and stop codon. the introns of 3car and cyp720b <dig> are of much lower gc content than the exons .

analyses of upstream promoter regions of 3car and cyp720b4
our analysis of upstream sequences for cis-regulatory elements covered  <dig>  bp upstream of the atg start codon for 3car and  <dig>  bp upstream of the atg start codon for cyp720b <dig>  putative cis-regulatory elements were identified by a similarity search of the plantcare database  <cit> . the region upstream of the atg in 3car is unique until - <dig>  bp which marks the location of a dna transposon . in contrast, only the region from - <dig> bp to - <dig> bp upstream of the start codon of cyp720b <dig> is unique, followed by repetitive sequence . several promoter enhancing sequences  were identified in the region immediately upstream of the start codon of the 3car and cyp720b <dig> genes .

since the spruce tps and cyp720b genes are involved in the biosynthesis of defence related terpenoids induced by insects, pathogens, wounding or methyl jasmomate   <cit> , we analysed the upstream genomic regions of 3car and cyp720b <dig> for putative cis-acting elements associated with plant defence responses . in cyp720b <dig>  a conserved w box motif , which interacts in arabidopsis with members of the wrky transcription factor family to mediate responses to wounding or pathogen responses  <cit> , is located at position - <dig>  relative to the atg of cyp720b <dig> on pgb <dig>  a similar element , involved in the meja-responsive gene expression in barley   <cit> , is detected at - <dig>  relative to the start codon of 3car and at - <dig> relative to the start codon of cyp720b <dig>  the upstream regions of 3car and cyp720b <dig> also contain a tca-element at positions - <dig> and - <dig>  in pgb <dig> and at positions - <dig> , - <dig> and - <dig>   in pgb <dig>  respectively. this element was first characterised as a cis-acting element involved in salicylic acid responsiveness and systemic acquired resistance in wild cabbage   <cit> . in addition, we identified several tc-rich repeats  in the up-stream regions of 3car  and cyp720b <dig> . these sequences were previously described in tobacco  as cis-acting elements involved in defence and stress responsiveness  <cit> .

the upstream regions of the 3car and cyp720b <dig> genes also include a large number of putative transcription factor binding sites , implicated in light responsiveness in several other plant species. interestingly, the promoter sequence including the transcribed 5'-utr of the 3car gene on pgb <dig> contains a unique and conserved repeated sequence of  <dig> bp  which is located four times  between - <dig> and - <dig> bp upstream of the start codon. seventeen of the  <dig> bp in this repeated sequence have high levels  of sequence identity to plant i-box transcription factor binding sites, which are involved in light responsiveness  <cit> . the actual role of this sequence in gene regulation is unknown, however, the prevalence of this sequence in the transcribed 5'-utr of the 3car gene on pgb <dig> as well as in the 5'-utr of two white spruce 3car-like ests  and one sitka spruce 3car-like est  would make this sequence a relevant target for future transcription factor binding site analysis. in addition, several cis-acting elements previously identified in other plant species to be involved in responses to giberellin , auxin , ethylene , and abiotic stresses  were found in the upstream regions of 3car and cyp720b <dig> 

identification and distribution of high and low complexity repeats in pgb <dig> and pgb04
since repeat regions may offer a particular challenge for genome sequence assembly in conifers, it is important to accurately detect and mask high and low complexity repeats. a comparison of the pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> sequences with the genome sequences of arabidopsis, rice, poplar, and grapevine  <cit>  identified  <dig> % of pgb <dig> and  <dig> % of pgb <dig> with similarity  to repetitive regions found in these angiosperms http://www.phytozome.net . using repeatmasker  <cit>  we found that high complexity repeats contribute to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the sequence of pgb <dig> and pgb <dig>  respectively . we identified regions with similarity to rna-based retroelements, predominantly ty1/copia and gypsy/dirs <dig>  element class) and a few segments of l1/cin <dig>  . in contrast to the large number of retroelement-based tes, we found few regions  with similarity to dna-based transposons . although pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> represent only a small fraction of the spruce gdna, the identification of these dna-based tes is important as this is the first report of these elements in a gymnosperm.

while ltr retrotransposons have been reported in spruce with a high copy number, it is not known if members of the ty1/copia or gypsy/dirs <dig> families are active in spruce  <cit> . presence of retrotransposons in the transcriptome and sequence conservation indicates that they are active. a blast search of the repetitive regions of pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> against est databases  yielded significant hits with ests from white spruce, sitka spruce, interior spruce and norway spruce as well as with pine species . pairwise comparison of the gdna sequences of pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> revealed substantial sequence conservation within the repeat regions . all regions with similarity to tes reside in large, often continuous sections with high homology  on pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> .

screening for homologous regions between and within pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> also identified several previously undetected repeated elements, one of which represents a putative conifer specific repeat element , which appears to have locally multiplied in pgb <dig> . a white spruce transcript with 91% identity to this csre is also present in the est database . the occurrence of high complexity repeats in the bac clones is estimated at  <dig> % in pgb <dig> and  <dig> % in pgb <dig>  values which are substantially higher than those found in the fully sequenced genomes of arabidopsis  and poplar , and similar to the genomes of rice  and grapevine   <cit>  .

discussion
sequencing and assembly of bac clones as a test for conifer genome sequencing
to date there is no sequence report for large segments of conifer gdna, and researchers have avoided sequencing a conifer genome due to the large size and high content of repetitive elements. several approaches are currently being considered for future efforts to sequence a conifer genome including the high-throughput sequencing of bac libraries. to assess the feasibility of sequencing and assembling long, continuous segments of conifer gdna, we targeted two white spruce defence genes, 3car and cyp720b <dig>  for bac clone isolation, sequencing and assembly. these genes were chosen because they are known to be members of large gene families with key functions in terpenoid biosynthesis.

pre-assembled bidirectional reads of shotgun plasmid libraries for each bac clone were assembled using phrap software resulting in a large number of contigs . both bac clones had areas of reduced quality reads with low or no sequence coverage bordered by regions of low complexity sequence repeats, which necessitated manual curation of the sequence assembly resulting in substantially improved sequence assemblies of two  and one  contigs. high complexity and simple repeats did not interfere with the automated phrap assembly and manual inspection of the contigs did not reveal falsely matched reads within the repeat regions. the use of pre-assembled paired reads and quality scores produced by phred balanced between tolerating discrepancies and complete mis-assembly of the data sets  <cit> . we found that most problems for automated sequence assembly resulted from chimeric clones in the plasmid libraries, bacterial dna contamination, low-quality sequences and low-complexity repeats.

targeted bac isolation of members of large conifer defence gene families provides insights into gene content of a conifer genome
the two genes targeted for bac sequencing are members of large defence-related tps and p <dig> gene families in spruce  <cit> . in the tps gene family, members with more than 90% sequence identity can have distinct biochemical functions with non-overlapping product profiles  <cit> . in this study we demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to isolate, in an efficient and targeted fashion, bac clones for specific members of the large conifer tps and cyp <dig> defence gene families, thus providing new opportunities to characterize members of these important defence gene families at the genome level.

the 3car gene contains  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, identical to the exon-intron structure of the grand fir  monoterpene synthase genes -limonene synthase and -α/β-pinene synthase, previously cloned by pcr amplification of the gdnas between the start and stop codons identified in the corresponding flcdnas   <cit> . the identity of the deduced amino acid sequence to the previously functionally characterised norway spruce 3car  <cit>  is 84%. the cyp720b <dig> gene has  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, and is the first genomic structure reported for a gymnosperm p <dig> gene. a comparison of the cyp720b <dig> gdna structure with the gdna structures of arabidopsis p450s shows highly conserved intron-exon boundaries between cyp720b <dig> and arabidopsis cyp <dig>  which is involved in the primary metabolism of giberellin biosynthesis. both families of p450s share a similar reaction mechanism and catalyse consecutive oxidation steps of structurally similar substrates  <cit> . these findings suggest a common ancestor of cyp <dig>  and cyp720b <dig> .

despite the large size of conifer genomes , it is not likely that the spruce genome contains a proportionally larger number of protein coding genes than arabidopsis as estimated from est and flcdna discovery  <cit> . in contrast to previously sequenced angiosperm genomes, the spruce gdna sequences of pgb <dig> and pgb <dig> reveal a low gene density, with a single gene per  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp respectively, which is at least 10-fold lower than the overall gene density of the genomes of arabidopsis, rice, poplar and grapevine . this observation of low gene density has also been confirmed by additional sequencing of several randomly selected spruce bac clones .

in angiosperms, several mechanisms contribute to the expansion of gene families, including whole genome and chromosome segmental duplications  <cit> , and tandem duplication of closely related genes  <cit> . for the gene family members targeted in this work, we did not find evidence for local tandem duplication.

the upstream regions of 3car and cyp720b <dig> contain putative cis-acting elements consistent with the roles of these genes in induced defence
a large volume of previous research on the regulation and coordination of defence responses in spruce has targeted processes at the anatomical and molecular levels of induced metabolite accumulation, enzyme activities, and transcript abundance of genes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoid and phenolic defences  <cit> . in particular, 3car transcripts were up-regulated by real and simulated insect attack in sitka spruce  <cit>  and in norway spruce  <cit> . in loblolly pine transcripts of the cyp720b <dig> related cyp720b <dig> were up-regulated in response to meja treatment  <cit> . in addition, large-scale proteome and gene expression profiling has identified putative transcription factors in spruce that were up-regulated in response to real or simulated insect attack  <cit> . this is the first report of the upstream sequences of conifer defence-related genes and the putative cis-acting elements located in those regions.

the upstream sequences of 3car and cyp720b <dig> each have more than five elements with sequence identity to cis-acting elements putatively involved in wound, stress and defence responses in angiosperms. the promoter region of the cyp720b <dig> gene is 95% to 99% identical with the corresponding pcr-amplified regions across several genotypes of sitka spruce, hybrid interior spruce, and white spruce . the conserved w-box motif present upstream of cyp720b <dig> is recognised and bound by transcription factors of the plant specific wrky class which mediate pathogen defence responses in angiosperms  <cit> . more than  <dig> members of the wrky family have been reported in pine  <cit>  and more than ten different sequences with 60% to 80% identity to the arabidopsis wrky proteins atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig>  involved in defence, stress and pathogen responses  <cit>  were found in the white spruce est databases. these putative promoter regions and cis-acting elements represent valuable tools for future studies of the transcriptional regulation of conifer defence genes. transformation of white spruce for characterization of promoters has been reported  <cit> . in future work we will use this transformation system, in parallel with transformation in heterologous plant systems, for functional testing of spruce tps and p <dig> promoter constructs linked to reporter genes.

the finding of a novel  <dig> bp sequence element which is detected four times in the 5'utr of the white spruce 3car gene on pgb <dig> was also found  <dig> times in the 5'utr of the orthologous gene isolated as a cdna in sitka spruce. the conservation of this short sequence across spruce species suggests that this element has an important functional role in the regulation of the 3car gene.

genomic regions surrounding the 3car and cyp720b <dig> genes contain dna and rna based transposable elements
the genomic regions surrounding the 3car and cyp720b <dig> genes contain retrotransposons, dna transposons and simple repeat sequences. with the exception of a fully preserved is <dig> element present in the genomic sequence of pgb <dig> , all repetitive sequences appear to have accumulated a large number of mutations, deletions and rearrangements suggesting that these elements are no longer functional. the repeat regions in the gdna of pgb <dig>  and pgb <dig>  have up to 89% similarity to white spruce te-related ests. the presence of ests for these tes indicates that members of these retrotransposon families may actively proliferate in conifers, potentially increasing genetic variability.

remnants of dna transposons of the cut-and-paste and copy-and-paste classes were found within  <dig> kbp and  <dig> bp of 3car and cyp720b <dig>  respectively. in maize, the dna-transposon helitron is associated with the duplication of cyp72a  <cit> , and dna-based transposons have been implicated in the capture and transduplication of host genes in rice, lotus japonicus and arabidopsis  <cit> . the proximity of dna transposons to the protein coding 3car and cyp720b <dig> genes is consistent with the possibility that a dna transposon-mediated translocation mechanism may contribute to the diversification of the conifer tps and p <dig> gene families.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the first sequence assembly and annotation of large segments of gdna from a conifer. we also demonstrate that genomic bac clones for specific members of large conifer defence gene families can be isolated in a very efficient and targeted fashion. this work provides important new information about the structure and content of conifer genome regions associated with the 3car and cyp720b <dig> genes in white spruce. features of low gene density, high content of repetitive sequence regions, and richness of tes identified in this work are likely characteristic of conifer genomes in general.

this work also provides relevant information for future efforts to sequence a conifer genome. cost-efficiency is a critical factor in genome sequencing and is a function of sequencing chemistry, the complexity of the region being sequenced, and the quality of the assembly. our simulation of the effect of bac sequencing depth on assembly coverage showed that increasing the sequencing depth beyond  <dig> -  <dig> × coverage results in only a marginal improvement of the sequence assembly. the future sequencing of a conifer genome will likely use a combination of ultra-high throughput methods in combination with sequencing of bac clones to anchor the high throughput reads. the bi-directional sanger sequencing used in this study generated high quality sequences of more than  <dig>  bp average length which were critical for the assembly of full-length bac clones. low quality reads resulting in poor sequence coverage occurred in regions of complex and simple repeats, which may also provide challenges for ultra high-throughput sequencing.
