BACKGROUND
homeobox genes encode homeobox proteins that play a crucial role in various developmental processes as transcription factors. a key feature of homeobox proteins is the homeodomain, a 60-amino-acid helix-turn-helix dna-binding domain  <cit> . due to their functional importance during development, most of the homeobox genes  are highly conserved at sequence level  <cit> . there have been only a few published examples of rapid evolution of homeobox genes, such as odsh in flies  <cit> , hox genes in nematodes  <cit> , the rhox <dig> cluster genes in rodents  <cit> , and tgiflx and esx <dig> in primates  <cit> . here we report a novel case of rapid evolution as well as copy number variation  of an x-linked reproductive homeobox family gene, member  <dig>  in primates. this homeobox gene is involved in spermatogenesis and may also play a role in brain function.

rhoxf <dig>  selectively expressed in the testis, was initially identified as a member of the pepp subfamily  <cit> . the human rhoxf <dig> gene is also named as testis homeobox gene  <dig>  or human paired-like homeobox protein . it is located on xq <dig> and contains  <dig> exons encoding a 288-amino-acids protein with two functional domains, the homeodomain and the proline-rich domain  <cit> . in humans, there are two copies of the rhoxf <dig> gene on xq <dig> in a head-to-head orientation, i.e. rhoxf <dig> and rhoxf2b  <cit> . the rhox  cluster genes in rodents have been considered to be orthologs of human rhoxf <dig>  <cit> . recent studies have shown that the human rhoxf <dig> protein is functionally similar to the rodent rhox <dig>  the founding member of the rhox cluster, expressed in the sertoli cells of the testis and promoting survival and differentiation of the adjacent male germ cells during spermatogenesis  <cit> . similar to the rhox cluster genes in rodents, the human rhoxf <dig> can down-regulate the expression of unc5c and pltp, and up-regulate gdap <dig> expression in the sertoli-cell pathway promoting germ cell survival  <cit> . interestingly, all three down-stream genes directly regulated by rhoxf <dig> in the testis also play important roles in the nervous system. in the brain, unc5c is a receptor of netrin- <dig>  which is important for axonal guidance, neuron migration and proliferation  <cit> . pltp is an important modulator of the signal transduction pathways in the human neurons, and is likely involved in neurodegenerative and inflammatory brain diseases  <cit> . gdap <dig> is involved in a signal transduction pathway in neuronal development, and is responsible for various charcot-marie-tooth diseases, the most common peripheral neuropathy  <cit> .

due to the function of rhoxf <dig> in spermatogenesis and possibly in the central nervous system, we studied the evolutionary pattern of this homeobox gene in primates, and we observed frequent gene duplications/losses and rapid protein sequence changes. we also performed expression pattern analysis in multiple primate species, and examined between-species and between-paralogs expression divergences. our evidence suggests that the rapid evolution of rhoxf <dig> at both the sequence and expression levels is likely to have been caused by selection on the male reproductive system and possibly also on the central nervous system.

RESULTS
rhoxf <dig> copy number variation in primates
in humans, there are two rhoxf <dig> gene copies on xq <dig> in a head-to-head orientation, rhoxf <dig> and rhoxf2b   <cit> . we sequenced the entire coding sequences  and about 600bp adjacent noncoding regions  in  <dig> human individuals . there are  <dig> individuals  showing no heterozygous sites in the entire sequenced region. this suggests that these individuals either have two identical or only a single copy of the rhoxf <dig> gene located on the x chromosome.

in the reference human genome, there are two  <dig> -kb segmental tandem repeats containing the two rhoxf <dig> copies . we sequenced the genomic regions covering the breakpoints of the two segmental repeats in  <dig> human genomic dna samples . the data indicated that the breakpoint sequences exist in all individuals , implying that they all have two copies. this result was further confirmed by genomic dna real-time quantitative pcr of  <dig> individuals with heterozygous sites  and  <dig> individuals without heterozygous sites  . using tktl <dig>  an x-linked single copy gene as a control, we found these samples are no difference in rhoxf <dig> genomic dna quantity . collectively, our data demonstrate that the two copies of rhoxf <dig> are fixed in contemporary humans.

to see whether the two-copy structure is conserved in nonhuman primates, we first conducted pcr-based sequencing of the entire coding region of the  <dig> non-human primate species . a single copy x-linked gene would have no heterozygous site in males, therefore heterozygous sites in males suggest more than one gene copy. our results showed that three species  have heterozygous sites in males, suggesting more than one copy in them. the two leaf monkey species  also have heterozygous sites. since a single copy x-linked gene would also have heterozygous sites in females due to within-copy polymorphisms, their copy numbers were then determined by genomic dna qpcr. the other  <dig> nonhuman primate species do not exhibit any heterozygous sites, implying either a single copy or two/multiple identical copies, which was then tested by genomic dna qpcr. according to the genome database, there are two copies in the white-tufted-ear marmoset  .

* the number of individuals for genomic dna analysis, brain cdna expression analysis, testis cdna expression analysis and multi-tissue expression analysis, respectively.

to identify the rhoxf <dig> gene sequences of individual copies, we cloned and sequenced the pcr products of the five species with heterozygous sites. in pig-tailed macaques and rhesus macaques , we identified two distinct sequences in both species, implying the presence of two copies. in rhesus macaques, there are  <dig> fixed single nucleotide differences between the two copies and all of them are non-synonymous substitutions located in the proline-rich domain . we then sequenced  <dig> rhesus macaque individuals . interestingly, all  <dig> rhesus macaques possessed the same two copy sequences without any within-copy polymorphic sites, implying strong functional restriction. the fixed sequence divergence between the two rhesus macaque copies is totally different from the pattern seen in humans, and the two human copies do not exhibit any fixed substitutions.

the grey leaf monkey and the black leaf monkey  also possess two distinct sequences with  <dig>  and  <dig>  substitutions respectively. the majority  of the substitutions are shared between the two species, suggesting that the substitutions are between-copy divergences instead of within-copy polymorphisms. therefore, grey leaf and black leaf monkeys likely possess two copies of rhoxf <dig> . phylogenetic analysis revealed that gene duplication occurred before the two species diverged .

the results of genomic dna qpcr indicated that the rhoxf <dig> genomic dna quantities of rhesus macaques and pig-tailed macaques are about twice those of other macaque species with no heterozygous sites . the same result was also seen for leaf monkeys when compared with the yunnan snub-nosed monkey  . the data further supports that rhesus macaques, pig-tailed macaques, grey leaf and black leaf monkeys possess two rhoxf <dig> gene copies, and there is only one copy in the nonhuman primate species without heterozygous sites.

in chimpanzees, we identified at least  <dig> different sequences by screening the  <dig> cdna clones from the testicle of a male individual, suggesting multiple copies in its genome . to explore the detailed genomic structure of rhoxf <dig> gene copies in the chimpanzee, we screened the bac  library of a male chimpanzee . we obtained  <dig> positive bac clones containing the rhoxf <dig> gene sequence, including 281c <dig>  349n <dig>  565a <dig>  602h <dig>  792f <dig>  792g <dig> and 834e <dig>  for three of them , sequences are available in the ncbi database . our bac-end and breakpoint-region re-sequencing confirmed the sequence alignments of the contig  containing the three ncbi bac clones, and  <dig> copies of rhoxf <dig> gene are located within this contig . two of the three copies are orthologs of the two human copies according to the synteny of this genomic region. we then partially sequenced the other  <dig> bac clones, and we found that 792f <dig> showed sequence differences from the  <dig> known bac clones, an indication of at least one extra copy in chimpanzees. finally, we performed genomic dna qpcr and the result showed that the copy number in chimpanzees is about  <dig> times  larger than in humans, suggesting 5- <dig> copies in chimpanzees. combining the data from the bac clones and the cdna clones from testicle and brain samples , there are at least  <dig> copies in the chimpanzee genome.

to reveal the genomic locations of all these copies in chimpanzees, using bac clone 281c <dig> as the probe containing a complete copy of rhoxf <dig>  we performed chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization . the results indicated that all signals are located in the long arm of x chromosome , suggesting that all the copies are possibly tandem duplications on xq <dig>  which was partially reflected by the determined genomic structure of the three copies in chimpanzees .

additionally, we sequenced the entire rhoxf <dig> gene coding region of six chimpanzee individuals . we observed in-del polymorphisms in exon  <dig> of three chimpanzees, implying that copy number variation might exist in chimpanzees. we also performed cdna sequencing of testicle samples in chimpanzees, and there are frame-shifting in-del polymorphisms, suggesting that there are non-functional copies  .

endogenous retrovirus  sequences and copy number variation
in humans, based on the sequences of male individuals, a total of  <dig> haplotypes were inferred using phase  <cit> . interestingly, we did not observe any fixed substitutions between the two human copies. the haplotype pattern indicates that almost all the substitutions are shared by the two copies, suggesting frequent non-allelic homologous recombination between them. further investigation showed that there are two human endogenous retrovirus  sequences located at the breakpoint region of the two copies . they are erv3-like sequences, similar to herv15yq <dig> and herv15yq <dig> located at yq <dig> in the human genome  <cit> . it has been shown that the intra-chromosomal homologous recombination between herv15yq <dig> and herv15yq <dig> can mediate duplications and deletions of the azoospermia factor a  region on the human y chromosome, resulting in male infertility  <cit> . we used the herv <dig> ltr 787-bp segment sequence as a reference to acquire the herv sequences located at xq <dig> from genome database  <cit> . it turned out that there is almost no difference  between the two herv sequences flanking rhoxf <dig> . thus, the flanking locations of the two herv sequences and their high sequence similarity suggest that the hervs may mediate frequent non-allelic recombinations of the two human copies, similar to the mechanism known for the azfa region  <cit> . in the database of genomic variants and 1000-genomes, low frequency copy number variations  were observed in humans covering the rhoxf <dig> gene region   <cit> , supporting the proposed non-allelic recombinations mediated by the hervs.

further analysis indicated that there are also erv sequences near rhoxf <dig> in the four nonhuman primate species as their whole-genome sequences available for study  . therefore, it is possible that endogenous retrovirus sequences are the key elements causing non-allelic recombinations, resulting in copy number variation among primates. in the marmoset, we found only one erv sequence near rhoxf <dig>  which is likely due to the insufficient coverage of this genomic region.

compared with the human sequences , the orthologous nonhuman primate erv sequences are highly diverged  . this implies that frequent non-allelic recombinations might not have occurred in nonhuman primates involving two rhoxf <dig> copies . for example, in the rhesus macaque, we identified only two rhoxf <dig> coding-region haplotypes with six fixed between-copy substitutions . this is consistent with previous computational analysis as well as data for arabidopsis, which proposed that the recombination frequency decreases very rapidly with the increase of sequence divergence  <cit> . in chimpanzee, there are more than two erv sequences , resulting in a more complicated pattern requiring further illumination through future detailed sequence analysis.

additionally, for the  <dig> primate species with no heterozygous site, the distinct sequence divergence between the flanking ervs  is consistent with our proposal of one rhoxf <dig> copy in these species, as determined by genomic dna qpcr .

multi-lineage positive selection on primates
we conducted coding sequence comparison among the primate species as well as phylogenetic-tree-based analysis for the molecular signatures of selection. to simplify the phylogenetic analysis, we generated two sequences by randomizing the snps of humans and chimpanzees respectively to represent their rhoxf <dig> coding sequences. different combinations of randomizing the snps gave rise to the same results, and it remains unaffected under the most conservative scenario in which the sequence was reconstructed in each species without any non-synonymous changes . all of the sequences from the other primates have distinctive haplotype sequences confirmed by clone sequencing. the intact copy of the marmoset sequence was used as an out-group.

the aligned protein sequences revealed high substitution rates  for rhoxf <dig> in catarrhini primates  we found that  <dig> %  of sites have become variable since the most recent ancestor of catarrhine. in other words, only  <dig> % of amino acids are identical among the  <dig> primate species, an indication of rapid evolution. besides amino acid changes, there are also multiple deletions/insertions of short amino acid fragments, especially along the lineages to humans and chimpanzees . notably, the fixed protein sequence divergence between human and chimpanzee is  <dig> % , which is much higher than the genome average   <cit> .

the comparison of non-synonymous  and synonymous  nucleotide distances between gene sequences can detect selection acting on a gene. a high ka/ks ratio  indicates positive selection, whereas a lower ka/ks ratio indicates negative selection . the ka versus ks ratios for all species indicated high values  in  <dig> out of the  <dig> pairs  , an implication of deviation from the expectation of neutrality  and strong positive selection on rhoxf <dig> during primate evolution. the signal of positive selection in primates was confirmed by comparing model 2a  and model 1a  using the maximum-likelihood method   <cit> . we also examined the detailed substitution pattern of each primate lineage in the phylogenetic tree . the ka/ks ratios of many primate lineages are larger than one, and some are statistically significant, especially the lineages leading to humans and chimpanzees, and the lineage to the yunnan snub-nosed monkey   <cit> .

notably, all of the ka/ks ratios for the lineages leading to humans and chimpanzees since the most recent common ancestor of catarrhines are larger than  <dig> . the likelihood ratio test  indicated that these lineages have a significantly larger ω  value  , suggesting strong positive selection during the evolution of humans and chimpanzees . in comparison, another rhox family member rhoxf <dig>  located in the same genomic region , evolved much more slowly than rhoxf <dig> .

note: a-e are the inferred ancestral nodes of the primate phylogenetic tree . n/s indicates the number of non-synonymous substitutions and the number of synonymous substitutions of each lineage. *ka/ks >  <dig>  p =  <dig>  

in the  <dig> human individuals tested, we observed eight sequence polymorphisms  and all of them are non-synonymous substitutions . surprisingly, three of them  are located in the homeodomain . no synonymous substitutions were observed in the entire coding region of rhoxf <dig>  an indication of on-going positive selection on current human populations. in the chimpanzee lineage , there are  <dig> non-synonymous substitutions while a 7-aa deletion without any synonymous substitution was located in the homeodomain . the ka/ks ratio is significantly larger than one   <cit> , again supporting the hypothesis of strong positive selection on the rhoxf <dig> homeodomain during the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.

note: the ancestral alleles in humans were determined by comparing with the non-human primate species. the frequencies shown are the derived alleles.

in old world monkeys, rhoxf <dig> were duplicated twice independently, one in the leaf monkey lineage and the other in the macaque lineage . theoretically, it is also possible that there have been three copy loss events  which can explain the observed pattern although it is less parsimonious than the proposed two independent duplications. strong positive selection was detected in the yunnan snub-nosed monkey lineage as well as in the lineage including rhesus and pig-tailed macaques . taken together, during the evolution of primates, along with parallel gene duplications and/or losses, positive selection has been acting on multiple primate lineages leading to the rapid protein sequence changes of rhoxf <dig> 

expression pattern of rhoxf <dig> in primates
to exam the expression pattern of rhoxf <dig> in primates, we performed real-time qpcr in four primate species . the general expression patterns in human, chimpanzee and gibbon are similar, consistent with the reported data in human and mice  <cit> , in which rhoxf <dig> is preferentially expressed in the testis . however, the rhesus macaque showed a very different expression pattern. rhoxf <dig> is expressed in all the major tissues, but the highest expression was observed in the lung instead of the testicle . this was further confirmed by testing two more individuals  . the functional implication of the preferential expression of rhoxf <dig> in the lung of rhesus macaque is yet to be dissected.

it is noteworthy that we also observed expression of rhoxf <dig> in the brain. in humans, rhoxf <dig> is weakly expressed in the brain compared with the testis, and there are between-individual and between-developmental-stage variations . in wayne et al. , the brain expression of rhoxf <dig> was not detected, which was likely due to the insensitive technology  used. rhoxf <dig> is also expressed in the brains of chimpanzee, gibbon and rhesus macaque.

to examine the expression of individual rhoxf <dig> paralog, we cloned and sequenced cdnas of the two rhoxf <dig> copies in humans, and screened  <dig> adult human testicle samples and  <dig> human brain samples. we found that both copies are almost equally expressed in all testicle samples , implying that the two copies are functionally redundant in the human testis. however, in the human brain, the expression pattern is different. in the embryo and new born brains, both copies are expressed , while only one copy is expressed in adult brains , suggesting tissue and developmental stage related expression divergence of the two rhoxf <dig> copies during human evolution.

in the chimpanzee brain, we detected four cdna sequences  and two of them are the major forms. one of the major forms  is a novel splice form that was not detected in the chimpanzee testis, however, this form produces a truncated protein. the other two minor forms likely represent background expression due to their truncated open-reading frames  and low expression levels. interestingly, all four brain-expressed forms are from only one of the six gene copies in chimpanzee, suggesting between-copy expression divergence, similar to the pattern observed in the human brain. in the rhesus macaque, the expression pattern is similar among testicle, brain and lung, in which copy- <dig> is preferentially expressed .

discussion
we have presented a novel case of rapid evolution of an x-linked homeobox gene in primates. interestingly, unlike the few previously studied cases  <cit> , rhoxf <dig> also shows copy number variation among primate species. we showed that there had been parallel rhoxf <dig> duplications and/or losses along multiple primate lineages, which were likely mediated by the flanking ervs. a similar gene duplication pattern was also observed for the mouse rhox alpha subcluster paralogs  <cit> , and gene loss was reported in the hox gene cluster in nematode  <cit> .

rhoxf <dig> and rhoxf <dig> are the only members of the rhox family in primates  <cit> . due to the rapid evolution of the rhox family, rhoxf <dig> and rhoxf <dig> are highly divergent from their rodent orthologs. however, their functional roles in the reproductive system have been maintained in both rodents and primates. in the mouse, rhox <dig> is expressed in both male and female germ cells in developing fetal gonad  <cit> . in adults, it is expressed in the testis, epididymis and ovary  <cit> . the rhox <dig> null mice are subfertile, with defects in spermatozoa production and motility  <cit> . the mouse rhox cluster has more than  <dig> genes with partially overlapping expression patterns, and plays partially redundant but distinct functional roles  <cit> . rhoxf <dig> and rhoxf <dig> in primates are functionally similar to rhox <dig> in mouse. in the testis, both of them may down-regulate unc5c and pltp expression, but only rhoxf <dig> can up-regulate gdap <dig> expression  <cit> . during primate evolution, rhoxf <dig> was apparently highly conserved and likely maintains its original functional role in the reproductive system. in contrast, rhoxf <dig> has evolved rapidly leading to potential functional divergence in primates.

darwinian positive selection is likely the key driving force leading to copy number variation, rapid amino acid changes as well as potential functional  divergence of rhoxf <dig> in primates. in several species, e.g. rhesus macaque and leaf monkeys, selection and lack of recombination have caused distinct sequence divergence between the two rhoxf <dig> copies within each species, which could lead to functional divergence. in humans, signals of rapid evolution and positive selection were also detected. however, due to frequent non-allelic recombinations, the two human copies have not clearly diverged. the situation in chimpanzees is much more complicated in which both rapid evolution and gene pseudolization might have occurred.

it has been shown that gene copy number and expression level are highly correlated  <cit> . for homeobox genes, due to their important roles in development, dosage changes may lead to functional consequences  <cit> . as the major function of rhoxf <dig> in primates is male reproduction, we speculate that the observed strong selection in multiple primate lineages is likely to be related to sperm competition in promiscuous mating systems  <cit> . among the  <dig> primate species studied, four species showed strong signatures of positive selection , and all of them have promiscuous mating systems  <cit> . this pattern is also seen for the rhox cluster in rodents  <cit> .

in addition to its potential role in spermatogenesis, rhoxf <dig> may also be involved in the functioning of the nervous system. all the three down-stream genes directly regulated by rhoxf <dig>  i.e. unc5c  <cit> , pltp  <cit>  and gdap <dig>  <cit>  also play important roles in the central nervous system. hence, the brain expression of rhoxf <dig> in primates implies its possible involvement in brain function. in humans, only one of the two rhoxf <dig> copies is expressed in adult brains, and both copies are expressed equally in the brains of embryos and new-borns. this suggests a potential role of rhoxf <dig> in brain development  <cit> . thus, it is likely that rhoxf <dig> may function in both the male reproductive system and the central nervous system through interactions with the down-stream genes. the question remains as to just how the expression of rhoxf <dig> is regulated in these different tissues.

it has been shown that the genome-wide gene expression patterns are similar between brain and testis in humans  <cit> . interestingly, the human rhoxf <dig> protein down-regulates the expression of the netrin- <dig> receptor, unc5c  <cit> , expressed in both brain and testis  <cit> . in the brain, the unc5c protein level is mainly influenced by the netrin- <dig> protein, which increases apoptosis of the unc5c-expressing neurons  <cit> . in the testis, unc5c prevents sertoli cell from apoptosis and ensure sperm production  <cit> . a genome-wide analysis of cancer-testis  gene expression showed that rhoxf <dig> is a ct gene with testis-selective expression  <cit> . coincidentally, the ct genes are also expressed in a high percentage of human central nervous system tumors  <cit> . the potential functional role of rhoxf <dig> in the brain is likely the outcome of darwinian positive selection which has driven the rapid evolution and functional divergence of rhoxf <dig> in primates, especially those species with more than one gene copies.

it is well known that brain evolution is not always positively associated with reproductive fitness  <cit> . a mutation with advantages for brain function may sometimes be detrimental to the reproductive system . therefore, natural selection will result in a balance between the competing demands and advantages of brain and testis functions. as rhoxf <dig> may play a dual role acting in the testis and brain, it may have developed certain mechanism for balancing potential functional conflicts between reproduction and cognition. one potential molecular mechanism is the between-copy gene expression divergence, e.g. in human, both of the rhoxf <dig> copies are equally expressed in the testis, but only one copy is expressed in the adult brain. the potential functional divergence of different copies are yet to be elucidated by further studies in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we provided an informative example of rapid evolution and copy number variation of an x-linked homeobox gene  in primates. our sequence analysis indicates that parallel gene duplications/losses were likely to have been mediated by the flanking ervs, and the rapid evolution of rhoxf <dig> had been driven by darwinian positive selection on the male reproductive system and possibly also on the central nervous system, resulting in between-copy sequence and expression divergence among the primate species with more than one gene copy.
