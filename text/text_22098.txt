BACKGROUND
most animal mitochondrial genomes contain  <dig> genes, including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> ribosomal rnas  and  <dig> transfer rnas  necessary for translation of the proteins encoded by the mtdna  <cit> . they also possess a major non-coding control region that contains the initial sites for mtdna replication and mtrna transcription. the mitochondrial genome generally evolves at elevated rates  compared to single copy nuclear genes, however its gene order often remains unchanged over long periods of evolutionary time, with some exceptions  <cit> . the genetic code of mitochondrial genomes is more degenerated and thus less constrained than the universal eukaryotic nuclear code  <cit> . in most animal mitochondrial genomes the genes are distributed on both strands, whereas in some, all genes are transcribed from one strand   <cit> . mitochondrial dna-derived markers have become popular for evolutionary studies, as the data obtained by their analysis may yield significant insights into the evolution of both the organisms and their genomes  <cit> .

teleosts represent the largest vertebrate group with over  <dig>  species, accounting for more than the half of all vertebrates. the ancestors of the oldest extant teleost species found on the earth today is believed to have originated from the mid-triassic, ca.  <dig> million years before present  <cit> . today's teleosts can be classified into  <dig> orders with a total of  <dig> families  <cit> . over  <dig> complete fish mitochondrial genomes – representing more than  <dig> orders – have been reported in the peer-reviewed literatures and more than  <dig> additional fully sequenced mitochondrial genomes can be retrieved from genbank .

the asian arowana  belongs to the order osteoglossiformes, one of the ancestral teleost clades with extant representatives restricted to freshwater habitats  <cit> . it is one of the most expensive ornamental fish species in the world. the asian arowana is listed by the convention on international trades in endangered species of wild fauna and flora  as a "highly endangered" species, therefore a special permit is required for farms dealing with its culture  <cit> . there are three basic colour varieties of the asian arowana: the green, the golden and red with several distinct sub-varieties. they all seem to have originated from different regions of southeast asia, which were probably connected through freshwater habitats during the pleistocene glacial ages   <cit> . according to currently accepted taxonomy, the osteoglossiformes order encompasses the osteoglossoidei and notopteroidei suborders. the osteoglossoidei suborder contains two families:osteoglossidae and pantodontidae. the osteoglossidae family is made up of seven species: scleropages formosus , s. jardinii , s. leichardti , osteoglossum bicirrhosum , o. ferreirai , arapaima gigas  and heterotis niloticus   <cit> . the pantodontidae family contains only one species, the butterfly fish, pantodon buchholzi   <cit> . among these eight osteoglossoidei species, mitochondrial genomes have been fully sequenced only from two species: o. bicirrhosum and p. buchholzi  <cit> . the sister suborder notopteroidei has three families with  <dig> species  <cit> , however complete mtdna sequence is only available for a single species, the goldeneye .

although the asian arowana is one of the most valuable ornamental teleosts, relatively few scientific papers have been published about the species in peer-reviewed literature. most of these are classical studies dealing with the taxonomy, and physiology of the species , only a recent papers use molecular methods . the lack of molecular and genomic information about asian arowana has hindered the study of its biology. polymorphic dna markers are expected to be highly useful tools for the understanding of the biology of asian arowana.

in this paper we describe the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of asian arowana that has a unique control region containing two different repeat arrays at its ends. phylogenetic analysis based on fully sequenced mitogenomes of all four osteoglossid species and sixteen other species from euteleostomi confirmed the position of osteoglossoidei among basal fishes. this mitogenomic sequence will be highly useful for the characterization of mtdna-based polymorphisms, which in turn will provide useful tools for the analysis of parental care of the species.

RESULTS
gene content and genome organization
the complete mitochondrial genome of asian arowana was sequenced with shotgun sequencing method . its total size was found to be ca.  <dig>  bp . except the mitochondrial control region the size of asian arowana mitochondrial genome was found to be similar to that of silver arowana, butterfly fish and goldeneye  <cit>  . the gc content of asian arowana mitochondrial genome was  <dig> %, the highest among mitochondrial genomes of all osteoglossiformes available in genbank .

on the whole, the structure of the asian arowana mitochondrial genome is very similar to that of silver arowana, butterfly fish and bichir . the number and order of genes in the asian arowana mitogenome  were found to be the same as common vertebrate form  <cit> . it contains  <dig> rna and  <dig> protein-coding genes:  <dig> subunits of the nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex ,  <dig> subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase complex , a single subunit of the ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex ,  <dig> subunits of atpase ,  <dig> ribosomal rna  and  <dig> transfer rna  genes. the non-coding control regions situated between the trnp and trnf genes contain the heavy strand origin of replication . a smaller control region containing the putative light strand origin of replication  was found between trnw and trny genes.

eleven potential overlaps between genes have been observed in the asian arowana mitogenome. the longest one  involving the two atpase genes appears to be common in most vertebrate mitochondrial genome, and its size in fish  is smaller than that in mammals . the second largest overlap is  <dig> bp long, , whereas the remaining nine were in the size range of 1– <dig> bp.

mitochondrial control region
the asian arowana mtdna's heavy strand control region, also known as d-loop, contains oh and is ca  <dig> bp long. similar to typical vertebrate mitogenomes, this non-coding region can be divided into three different domains  <cit>  . domain i which is  <dig> bp long, consists of a termination associated sequence   <cit>  and several copies of a previously described conserved palindromic motif without any known function  <cit> . a  <dig> bp tandem repeat array, suggested to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial genome replication by forming a thermostable "hairpin"  <cit> , was also found in this domain . domain ii – commonly known as the central conserved block – covering the 401– <dig> bp stretch in the control region, showed high similarity to domain ii of rainbow trout  <cit>  and sturgeon  <cit>  . in domain iii, a ta-dinucleotide microsatellite repeat was present in all the six individuals from which the control region was sequenced. two conserved sequence blocks  found in this domain showed high similarity to csbs detected earlier in other species  <cit>  whereas csb <dig> described earlier in teleosts  <cit>  was not found.

a smaller control region  for ol exhibited high sequence similarity to the corresponding region in silver arowana, bichir and butterfly fish . the at content of asian arowana ol which was  <dig> %, is similar to that of butterfly fish but higher than in silver arowana  and much lower than in bichir . the secondary structure of ol was suggested earlier to regulate light strand replication  <cit> . in asian arowana this secondary structure consists of a perfect  <dig> bp stem  and loop structure. despite the fact that the control region is the most variable region in animal mtdnas, most part of the stem  was found to be conserved in the mitogenomic ol of several fish species  and even mammalian ones  <cit> .

repeats in the heavy strand control region
the mtdna of all six asian arowana individuals tested possess a heteroplasmic tandem repeat array in domain i . the tandem repeat arrays in the six individual fishes sequenced contained  <dig> to  <dig> repeat units, resulting in variable length of the heavy strand control region . a partial repeat unit could also be found at the beginning and at the end of the array indicating that it might have been formed by replication slippage  <cit> .

the tandem repeat units were highly similar with only a few base substitutions . each repeat unit in the array was  <dig> bp long . the conserved motif tacat  and its complement atgta, were both located in the stem region providing the theoretical ability of forming a stable hairpin loop . our investigation of the other three members of osteoglossiformes with fully sequenced mitogenome  has shown that this conserved motif could also be found in a similar arrangement in their heavy strand control region . further investigation revealed that the two motifs could also be found in the heavy strand control region of several eel species  . the conservation of this motif across various vertebrate taxa suggests that it serves an important role in the mitochondrial heavy strand control region. an extensive search of the literature database showed that since it was reported more than a decade ago, no extensive study was published to investigate its function. based on the position of the motif, we speculate that it might be required for the formation of a thermostable hairpin involved in replication of the tandem repeat array. we also cannot rule out the possibility of the motif being binding sites for proteins involved in replication.

another type of repeat – a ta-type dinucleotide microsatellite – was present at the opposite end of the heavy strand control region in domain iii . the number of ta core units ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in the six individuals sequenced. although both tandem repeats alone  or microsatellites in the tandem repeat array  <cit>  has been reported earlier in the heavy strand control regions of some species, to our knowledge no one has reported the existence of both types of repeats on the same heavy strand control region.

protein-coding genes
the start codon usage in the asian arowana mitogenome was found to be the same as that of zebrafish  <cit> . all but one of the  <dig> protein coding genes began with the orthodox atg start codon, only cox <dig> used gtg start codon . ten genes ended in a complete termination codon, either taa, tag or aga. the remaining three genes  did not possess a complete stop codon, but did show a terminal t. this condition is known to be common to vertebrate mitochondrial genomes whereby post-transcriptional polyadenylation provides the two adenosine residues required for generating the taa stop codon  <cit> .

the total nucleotide length for the  <dig> coding genes was found to be  <dig>  bp, shorter than that of silver arowana and butterfly fish, but longer than that of bichir . the coding sequences in asian arowana consisted of  <dig> % a,  <dig> % t,  <dig> % g and  <dig> % c bases. the corresponding ranges for silver arowana, butterfly fish and bichir were  <dig> – <dig> % ,  <dig> – <dig> % ,  <dig> – <dig> % , and  <dig> – <dig> % . these data further support the observations: i) the gc content of asian arowana mitogenome is higher than that of other teleost, including other known osteoglossoidei species; and ii) the frequency of g is the lowest among the four bases in fish mitochondrial genomes  <cit> .

comparison of amino acid sequences for the  <dig> proteins among asian arowana, silver arowana, butterfly fish and bichir confirmed the closer taxonomic relatedness of asian arowana to silver arowana, than to butterfly fish or bichir . in agreement with others' data  <cit> , cox <dig> was the most conserved gene and atp <dig> was the most variable.

the pattern of codon usage in asian arowana mtdna was also studied. the most frequently used amino acids were leucine , followed by threonine , alanine  and glycine  . at the third codon position, the order of nucleotide usage frequency was c > a > t > g , the same order was described earlier for the mitochondrial genome of japanese fugu  <cit> . the order was somewhat different in the silver arowana, butterfly fish and bichir, where a became the most frequently used base in the third codon position, albeit the frequency of g remained the lowest .

for amino acids with fourfold degenerate third codon position, codons ending with a were the most frequent , followed by c , t  and g . genes located on the heavy strand showed a typical native gc and positive at skew , whereas the nad <dig> gene located on the light strand displayed an opposite pattern. with regard to the absolute value, the gc skew was always higher than the at skew: the former ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  whereas the latter ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . similar patterns were also seen in silver arowana, butterfly fish and bichir . the gc and at skews in asian arowana were not correlated .

transfer rna genes
the twenty-two trna genes typical of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes have all been detected in the asian arowana mitogenome. all trna genes possessed anticodons that match the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. the length of trna genes ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp  with a total length of  <dig>  bp, similar to silver arowana and bichir, but shorter than that in butterfly fish . the inferred secondary structure of the  <dig> trna genes had several uniform features:  <dig> bp in the aminoacyl stem,  <dig> bp in the tφc and anticodon stem,  <dig> bp in the dhu stem and  <dig> bp in the anticodon loop. a "u" residue before the anticodon was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> trna, whereas a purine was detected in the position immediately 3' to the anticodon. in the stem regions, there were several non-complementary pairings, mainly a-c type. a similar structure has been found in the silver arowana, whereas different kinds of non-standard base pairings have also been described in other fish species  <cit> . the original sequences and the secondary structure of the trna genes were quite different in genetically distant related species.

ribosomal rna genes
like the mitochondrial genome of other fishes, the asian arowana mitogenome was found to possess two ribosomal rna  genes, a small rrna gene  and a large rrna gene , the two being separated by trnv . the length of rrns and rrnl are  <dig> and  <dig>  bp, respectively . these sizes are similar to those in the other three species used for comparison . substitution rates of the two rrnas among asian arowana, butterfly fish and bichir were lower than those of protein coding genes. secondary structures found in the four species seemed to be conserved across large evolutionary distances, as described earlier for teleosts  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of the osteoglossomorpha superorder
several studies have been published recently on the phylogeny of osteoglossoidei suborder using morphological data  <cit> , partial mitochondrial sequences  <cit> , a few nuclear genes  <cit>  or the combination of the latter two  <cit> . on the other hand, there is only a single study that analysed the phylogenetic relationship of the osteoglossids based on all genes present in the mitochondrial genomes  <cit>  but the asian arowana was not included as its complete mitogenomic sequence was not available.

to determine whether the addition of the complete asian arowana mitogenome causes any difference in the evolutionary position of the osteoglossomorpha from the cladograms produced earlier  <cit> , we used the complete asian arowana mitogenome sequence obtained in this study and other osteoglossids' complete mitogenome sequences to carry out phylogenetic analysis. beside the osteoglossid species our analysis also included mtdna from three fish species of ancestral lineages: four members of the chondrostei taxon and representatives for both the elopomorpha and clupeocephala taxa . using both nucleotide and amino acid sequences of different kinds of mitochondrial genes  the systematic arrangements were reconstructed as monophyletic which is in agreement with the relationship tree of basal actinopterygians produced by inoue and colleagues  <cit> .

phylogenetic trees constructed with the various data sets using three different methods  showed little variations within the data set, indicating that variation mainly originated from the type of data and not the methods used . on all trees the asian arowana was clustered into one group with the silver arowana, butterfly fish and goldeneye  with a high bootstrap support value. however, within teleostei taxon the position of osteoglossomorpha clade varied in the trees generated using concatenated protein-coding cum trna nucleotide sequences and concatenated protein-coding cum trna cum rrna nucleotide sequences data sets. on the other hand, trees generated using concatenated protein-coding nucleotide sequences and concatenated amino acid sequences data sets consistently placed the osteoglossomorpha clade at the basal level . this is in agreement with trees constructed earlier by others using various molecular  <cit>  and morphological data  <cit> . in addition the proximity of osteoglossomorpha clade to that of basal teleost clades in our study further supports the position of osteoglossids among the early branches of living teleosts' stem lineages 

the placement of goldeneye and butterfly fish was different in osteoglossid cladograms produced earlier on the basis of morphological data  <cit> . while most publications predicted that during the evolution of osteoglossids the ancestor of goldeneye split off earlier from the arowanas, than from the butterfly fish  <cit> . one study proposed exactly the opposite  <cit> . our cladogram based on full mtdna sequences similarly to the data from  <cit>  from four osteoglossids supports the former situation .

since goldeneye is the only complete mtdna sequence reported for notopteroidei suborder, additional full mitogenomic sequences from this taxonomic group will have to be obtained for a more detailed analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
although the length, gene content and gene order of the mitochondrial genome of asian arowana is similar to those of other teleost and vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, it exhibits a number of interesting characteristics. among them the most interesting is the presence of two different kinds of polymorphic repeat sequences at the opposite ends of the mitochondrial control region. these repeats could be potentially useful for the analysis of genetic diversity of populations, as well as phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies of the asian arowana and possibly other members of osteoglossoidae family. the complete mitogenome of asian arowana provides an additional important dataset for the study of osteoglossids and other basal fish species.

materials and methods
sample collection and preparation
six adult asian arowana individuals  were obtained from a fish farm in singapore. a small piece of fin clip  was collected from every individual and kept in absolute ethanol at 4°c. whole genomic dna including nuclear and mitochondrial dna was isolated using a quick method developed previously in our laboratory  <cit> .

pcr amplifications
two pairs of primers  were designed from nucleotide sequences of nad <dig> gene  and cob gene  deposited in genbank. long distance pcrs were carried out using expand long template pcr system  to amplify  <dig> overlapping fragments of the complete mitochondrial genome. each  <dig> μl reaction volume contained  <dig> × pcr buffer  <dig>  with  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> nm of each primer,  <dig> μm dntp,  <dig> ng genomic dna of one green asian arowana and  <dig> u taq polymerase mix . the following pcr program was used:  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> sec, 63°c for  <dig> sec and 68°c for  <dig> min then  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> sec, 63°c for  <dig> sec and 68°c for  <dig> min with an addition of  <dig> sec/cycle, as well as a final extension at 68°c for  <dig> min. primer pair dmt-a1b <dig> amplified a fragment of ca.  <dig>  kb and primer pair dmt-a2b <dig> produced ca.  <dig>  kb product. the two fragments overlapped at both ends by a total of ca.  <dig> kb.

shotgun sequencing and assembly
pcr products  were sonicated using branson digital sonicator model  <dig>  at 20% power for  <dig> seconds to generate dna fragments suitable for cloning into a plasmid . sonicated pcr products were treated with t <dig> dna polymerase, klenow dna polymerase and t <dig> polynucleotide kinase  according to manufacturer's protocol to blunt and phosphorylate the ends. treated dna fragments were electrophoresed through a 1% low melting agarose gel . fragments between  <dig> bp and  <dig>  kb size were cut out from the gel and cleaned using self-made glassmilk as described previously  <cit> . the isolated dna fragments were ligated into pbluescript ks   vector pre-digested with smai . nucleotide sequencing of the cloned inserts was conducted by using bigdye assay kit version  <dig>   and m13f/m13r sequencing primer .

identification of genes
trna genes were identified as described by lowe and eddy  <cit>  with a cove cutoff score of  <dig> . protein and ribosome rna genes were identified by sequence similarity to their orthologs from other mitochondrial genomes. the 5' ends of protein-coding genes were inferred to be at the first legitimate in-frame start codon   <cit>  that did not overlap with the preceding gene, except with an upstream trna gene and was limited to the most 3' nucleotide of the trna. protein gene termini were inferred to be at the first in-frame stop codon . in some genes a t or ta nucleotides adjacent to the beginning of a downstream gene was designated as the truncated codon and assumed to be completed by polyadenylation after transcript cleavage  <cit> .

base composition and codon usage
editseq and genequest software  were used to analyze base composition and codon usage. compositional skew, which indicates compositional difference between the two strands, was calculated using the following formula proposed by perna and kocher  <cit> :

gc skew = /

and

at skew = /

,where c, g, a, and t are the frequencies of the four bases at third codon position of the eight fourfold degenerate codon families.

characterization of the at microsatellite in the heavy strand control region
a pair of primers  was designed using primerselect  to flank the microsatellite site in heavy strand control region. one of the primers was labeled with a fluorescent dye 6fam at the 5' end. the pcr mastermix consisted of  <dig> × pcr buffer with  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> ,  <dig> nm primer,  <dig> μm dntp,  <dig> ng genomic dna, and  <dig> u dynazyme polymerase . the amplification was performed in a ptc- <dig> pcr machine  using the following program: 94°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> sec, 55°c for  <dig> sec and 72°c for  <dig> sec followed by a final extension at 72°c for  <dig> minutes. pcr products were separated on an abi  <dig> dna sequencer  as described previously  <cit> . all six individuals were genotyped to detect possible polymorphism.

characterization of the long tandem repeat in the heavy strand control region
for characterization of long tandem repeat in the heavy strand control region, we designed one pair of primers  flanking the control region using primerselect . complete heavy strand control region was amplified from total genomic dna of the six individuals used earlier for microsatellite genotyping under the following pcr conditions: 94°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> sec, 55°c for  <dig> sec and 72°c for  <dig> min, followed by a final extension at 72°c for  <dig> minutes. pcr products were cleaned using home-made glassmilk  <cit>  before cloning into pgem-t cloning vector . clones were sequenced from both directions using m13f and m13r sequencing primers and bigdye assay kit version  <dig>  . forward and reverse sequences were assembled by using sequencher .

for detailed study of the control region tandem repeat array, various osteoglossiformes species  and anguilla species  sequences were downloaded from ncbi genbank. a single unit from the various tandem repeat array were then aligned using clustalx  <cit> . hairpin structure of a repeat unit from the tandem repeat array was constructed using mfold  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic analysis was performed using mitochondrial genome of eighteen fish species from representatives of actinopterygii and sarcopterygii taxa – among them all four available full mtdna from the osteoglossiformes superorder – were used . a shark species, called spiny dogfish  was used as outgroup. four different data sets were analysed: i) concatenated protein-coding, trna and rrna nucleotide sequences; ii) concatenated protein-coding and trna nucleotide sequences; iii) concatenated protein-coding nucleotide sequences and iv) concatenated protein-coding amino acid sequences. amino acid sequences were aligned using clustalx  <cit>  then its nucleotide sequences were aligned with references to the amino acid sequences alignment using codonalign  <dig>   <cit> ) and further edited manually. the full sequence of nad <dig> encoded by the l strand was excluded from the analysis, due to the deviating nucleotide and amino acid composition of this gene as compared to those encoded by the h strand. third codons of the  <dig> heavy strand encoded protein-coding genes were excluded from the analysis together with loops of trna. each of the four datasets were analyzed by maximum parsimony  method in mega version  <dig>   <cit> , bayesian inference  method using mrbayes  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and maximum likelihood  using tree-puzzle version  <dig>   <cit>  for amino acids data set and treefinder version of may  <dig>  <cit>  for nucleotide data sets.

for mp analysis  <dig> random additions were done using the close-neighbour-interchange option with search level  <dig>  bootstrap analysis with  <dig> replicates was conducted.

to find the best model for the nucleotides and amino acid data sets, we applied modeltest version  <dig>   <cit>  and prottest version  <dig>   <cit>  respectively. the best-fit model was gtr + i + g for all nucleotide data sets and mtrev + i + g for the amino acid data set. bi method was performed for  <dig> generations using nucleotide data sets and  <dig> ×  <dig> generations for the amino acid sequences data set. the first 25% of samples were discarded as burn-in.

quartet-based ml analysis for amino acid data set was performed using treepuzzle  <cit> .  <dig> steps were performed and the mtrev <dig> substitution model was used. for parameter estimation, quartet sampling and nj tree option was chosen. for ml analysis of nucleotides data sets, the program treefinder  <cit>  was used. gtr substitution model was used and bootstrap analysis was performed with  <dig> replicates.
