BACKGROUND
the human immunodeficiency virus  rev protein is a small  post-transcriptional activator of expression of incompletely spliced and unspliced hiv mrnas. since these hiv transcripts direct production of progeny virions, rev is a crucial factor in hiv replication . rev interacts with hiv mrnas by binding to a structured rna element called the rre . rev offsets the activities of inhibitory sequences  in hiv- <dig> mrnas  <cit>  and promotes their export to the cytoplasm. once in the cytoplasm, rev may also stimulate production of viral proteins on translational level .

rev characteristically localizes to the nucleus, where it accumulates in nucleoli. however, a proportion of the rev molecules expressed in a cell continuously shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm by using active transport mechanisms both for entry into and exit from the nucleus.

mutational analyses of the rev protein have identified various functionally important regions, indicating that rev is organized into modular domains . the n-terminal domain of rev contains an arginine-rich motif  with dual functions as a nuclear localization signal  and rna binding domain. sequences flanking the arm  direct multimerization of rev. the c-terminal domain of rev, also known as activation domain, contains a leucine-rich motif  that functions as a nuclear export signal.

biochemical analyses indicate that rev directly binds the nuclear transport receptors importin β and crm1/exportin  <dig>  <cit> . interaction of rev with crm1/exportin  <dig> was confirmed by two-hybrid assays in yeast  <cit>  and in human cells  <cit> . together with results from various other experimental approaches , these observations have led to the concept that import of rev into the nucleus is mediated by interaction of the arm/nls with importin  and export of the rev-rna complex from the nucleus by interaction of the rev-nes with crm1/exportin  <dig> 

various other rev-interacting cellular factors have been identified by using rev or segments of rev for yeast two-hybrid screening of cdna libraries or for biochemical purification of interacting factors from cell extracts.

cellular factors shown to interact with the arm of rev include p <dig>  <cit>  and b <dig>  <cit> . human p <dig> was recently reported to block splicing of rev-dependent hiv transcripts  <cit> . the nucleolar protein b <dig> was shown to stimulate nuclear import of rev  <cit>  and counteract aggregation of rev  <cit> in vitro.

the c-terminal domain of rev interacts with various human nucleoporins, including hrip/hrab, nlp- <dig>  nup <dig>  and nup <dig>  <cit> . other factors shown to interact with this domain of rev are eif-5a  <cit>  and the nuclear kinesin-like protein rebp  <cit> . hrip/hrab, nup  <dig> and eif-5a interact with crm <dig> as well as rev  <cit> , suggesting that rev can associate with crm <dig> in multifactorial complexes in which crm <dig> "bridges" the interaction of rev with other factors. rev-crm <dig> complexes containing hrip/hrab or eif-5a may be crucial for rev-dependent export of hiv rnas, since eif-5a and hrip/hrab have been shown to be essential for rev-directed rna export in xenopus oocytes and in human cells, respectively  <cit> .

nuclear export of rev has proven to be exemplary for many viral and cellular factors . since the discovery of leucine-rich signals in rev  <cit>  and in the cellular regulatory factor pkiα  <cit> , these sequences have been shown to mediate the export of numerous factors from the nucleus by crm1/exportin <dig>  <cit> . the drug leptomycin b , first shown to block nuclear export of rev  <cit> , proved to be a potent inhibitor of crm1-dependent export  <cit>  and is now widely used to identify transport substrates of crm <dig>  elucidating interactions of rev with cellular factors is highly relevant to understanding pathogenicity of hiv and may have an impact on the design of therapeutic anti-hiv strategies. the functional diversity of rev and its activities in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell suggest the existence of still unidentified rev-interacting factors. therefore we reasoned that screening of a human cdna library with rev as "bait" should lead to isolation of novel rev-interacting human factors. of particular interest would be the identification of unknown human gene products, since their interaction rev would not only be relevant for rev function but would also provide a key for biological characterisation of these novel factors.

here we identify a human cdna that encodes a novel protein  that interacts specifically with rev via sequences in the n-terminal half of rev. we show that  <dig> . <dig> is exported from the nucleus by crm <dig> and localizes to the cytoplasm. in rev-expressing cells,  <dig> . <dig> is recruited to nucleoli.  <dig> . <dig> has a negative effect on rev function in a rev-reporter assay. these results suggest that  <dig> . <dig> can act as a modulator of rev function.

RESULTS
identification of novel hiv- <dig> rev-interacting proteins
to identify novel rev-interacting proteins, we screened a library of cdnas derived from the human jurkat t-cell line with full-length rev as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. repeated selection procedures led to isolation of two library plasmids  encoding specific interactors of rev.

sequence analyses and data base comparisons revealed that the  <dig> bp insert in plasmid  <dig> . <dig> is identical with a segment of a  <dig> bp cdna encoding human dna binding protein b   <cit> . the predicted coding sequences in the  <dig> . <dig> cdna comprise the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of the dbpb protein . several biological activities have been attributed to dbpb, including binding to dna  <cit>  and rna  <cit>  and regulation of transcription  <cit> .

the other library plasmid  <dig> . <dig> contained a  <dig> bp insert of which a region of over  <dig> nucleotides showed strong similarity to a sequence within a human fetal heart cdna . in the fetal heart cdna the matching region encompasses a predicted open reading frame. alignment of the  <dig> . <dig> and the fetal heart cdna sequences yielded a sequence encoding a hypothetical  <dig> amino acid  <dig> . <dig> protein. since interaction with rev is the first biological activity associated with this gene product, we analysed interaction of rev with the  <dig> . <dig> protein in more detail.

to investigate which regions of rev contribute to interaction with the  <dig> . <dig> protein, we analysed the capacity of various known mutants of rev to interact with  <dig> . <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid assay. the amino acid exchanges in these mutants map to regions associated with major biological properties of rev , including multimerization , rna binding and nuclear localization/accumulation  and nuclear export of rev . expression of lexa-rev-mutant bait proteins in yeast transformants was confirmed by western blot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against rev . as positive control for rev interaction, interaction analysis was performed with lexa-rev bait and b42ad-rev prey, confirming oligomerization of wildtype rev molecules with each other .

while rev mutants revm <dig> and rev m10bl were capable of interacting with  <dig> . <dig>  no interaction was observed with rev mutants revm <dig> and revslt <dig> . these results indicate that amino acid residues r <dig> or r <dig> of the arm and i <dig> or l <dig> of the multimerization region ii  are required for interaction of rev with the  <dig> . <dig> protein. furthermore, they suggest that the  <dig> . <dig> interacting sequences in rev are located between aa positions  <dig> and  <dig> 

for more detailed study of the interaction of the  <dig> . <dig> protein with rev, yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed with various segments of the  <dig> . <dig> cdna as prey and wildtype rev as bait . amino acid regions of  <dig> . <dig> extending from position  <dig> to  <dig> and from position  <dig> to  <dig> showed similar rev-binding capacity as full-length  <dig> . <dig> protein. in contrast, both the n-terminal region  and the c-terminal region  of  <dig> . <dig> failed to interact with rev. while  <dig> . <dig> protein fragments from position  <dig> to  <dig> or position  <dig> to  <dig> clearly interacted with rev, interactions were weaker than that of full-length  <dig> . <dig>  these results indicate that the rev-interacting region of the  <dig> . <dig> protein is located between amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig> and that, within this region, sequences n- and c-terminal of position  <dig> contribute to interaction with rev.

interaction of the  <dig> . <dig> protein with rev, crm <dig> and itself in human cells
the interaction of the  <dig> . <dig> protein with rev in yeast raises the question whether the  <dig> . <dig> protein can also interact with rev in human cells. it was also of interest whether  <dig> . <dig> is capable of interacting with human crm <dig>  since crm <dig> has been shown to interact with several rev-associated factors .

we addressed these issues with a mammalian two-hybrid assay, in which the interaction of a protein fused to the gal <dig> dna-binding domain with a second protein fused to the vp16-activator domain induces transcription of a luciferase reporter gene from a synthetic promoter . rev was fused to vp <dig>  to avoid unspecific interactions between the acidic vp <dig> domain  <cit>  and the basic rev protein . functionality of vp16-rev was demonstrated  in a rev-reporter assay  <cit> . for interaction analysis, hek <dig> cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for vp16-rev and gal4- <dig> . <dig> fusion proteins and the reporter plasmid pg5luc. as shown in fig.  <dig>  a ≈11-fold mean induction of luciferase activity was observed in  <dig> independent transfection experiments. assessment of interaction of  <dig> . <dig> with human crm <dig> in cells coexpressing gal4- <dig> . <dig> and vp16-hcrm <dig> revealed a ≈41-fold mean induction of luciferase activity export  . self-interaction of the  <dig> . <dig> domain was analysed by coexpressing gal4- <dig> . <dig> and vp16- <dig> . <dig>  resulting in ≈12-fold mean induction of luciferase activity .

in all three cases, induction of luciferase activity was significantly  increased over induction levels obtained in control assays with unfused vp <dig> and gal4- <dig> . <dig> .

these results indicate that the  <dig> . <dig> domain is capable of interacting with rev as well as with the export receptor crm <dig> and of forming homo-oligomers in human cells.

cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> . <dig> is crm1/exportin  <dig> dependent
comparison of the sequence in the  <dig> . <dig> cdna with the fetal heart cdna indicated that the  <dig> . <dig> sequence was incomplete at its 5' terminus. to generate a full-length   <dig> . <dig> coding sequence, nucleotides encoding the first  <dig> n-terminal amino acids derived from the predicted open reading frame of the fetal heart cdna were inserted upstream of the  <dig> . <dig> cdna. to analyse subcellular localization of the  <dig> . <dig> protein, cells were transfected with plasmids directing expression of fusion proteins containing full-length  <dig> . <dig> or various segments of  <dig> . <dig>  those fusion proteins contained either a n-terminal igg <dig> tag or a c-terminal gfp tag. the full-length igg1- <dig> . <dig> fusion protein  was located mainly in the cytoplasm of hela cells . igg <dig> fusion proteins with  <dig> . <dig> regions extending from amino acid position  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> showed similar predominantly cytoplasmic localization . in contrast, igg <dig> fusion proteins with the n-terminal region  or the c-terminal region  of  <dig> . <dig> were apparent in both nucleus and cytoplasm, similar to unfused igg <dig>  these results demonstrate that the  <dig> . <dig> protein is capable of cytoplasmic accumulation and suggest that sequences directing cytoplasmic localization of the  <dig> . <dig> protein are located between amino acid positions  <dig> to  <dig> 

the  <dig> .1-gfp fusion protein showed similar cytoplasmic localization as igg1- <dig> . <dig> . quantitative evaluation of subcellular distribution of gfp fluorescence  <cit>  revealed that only 25% of total fluorescence was contained in the nuclei of  <dig> .1-gfp expressing cells. this localization is comparable to that of gfp fusion proteins containing pkiα  or the carboxyterminal half of rev -gfp), which localize to 23% and 25%, respectively, in the nucleus . pkiα and the carboxyterminal half of rev contain well-characterized recognition signals for crm1/exportin 1-dependent export  <cit> . similar cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> .1-gfp and interaction of  <dig> . <dig> with crm1/exportin  <dig> in human cells  raised the possibility that cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> .1-gfp at steady state may involve nuclear export of  <dig> . <dig> by crm1/exportin  <dig>  therefore we analysed the effect of leptomycin b , an inhibitor of crm1-dependent nuclear export  <cit>  on subcellular distribution of  <dig> .1-gfp. lmb treatment significantly increased the nuclear proportion of  <dig> .1-gfp from 25% to 44%. lmb-induced nuclear redistribution was similar in cells expressing pkiα-gfp and rev-gfp, whose nuclear proportion increased to 49% and 46%, respectively. quantitative analysis demonstrated that 45% of unfused gfp localized to the nucleus, in agreement with its known capacity to diffuse throughout the cell  <cit> . lmb had no significant effect on subcellular distribution of unfused gfp.

these results indicate that cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> . <dig> involves nuclear export by crm1/exportin <dig>  amino acid region  <dig> to  <dig> of  <dig> . <dig> seems to be crucial for those transport processes.

identification of a candidate nuclear export signal in  <dig> .1
to further characterize the involvement of the amino acid region 74– <dig> in cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> . <dig>  we assessed subcellular distribution of gfp fusion proteins containing this region of  <dig> . <dig>  cells expressing a gfp fusion protein with a single copy of aa 74– <dig> of  <dig> . <dig> contained a higher proportion of nuclear fluorescence  than cells expressing gfp fusion proteins with full-length  <dig> . <dig> . however, gfp-fusion proteins containing two copies of region  <dig> to  <dig> of  <dig> . <dig> in tandem showed similar cytoplasmic localization  as full-length  <dig> .1-gfp . treatment of cells with lmb raised nuclear proportions of gfp fusion proteins with one or two copies of  <dig> . <dig> region 74– <dig> to similar levels as full-length  <dig> .1-gfp. these results suggest that the region between amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig> contains a crm1/exportin  <dig> dependent nuclear export signal, which can act in a cumulative manner.

examination of the hypothetical amino acid sequence of region  <dig> to  <dig> revealed a clustering of leucine and isoleucine residues between amino acid  <dig> and  <dig> . to analyse whether region  <dig> to  <dig> of the  <dig> . <dig> protein functions as a nuclear export signal, we compared its translocation capacities with the rev-nes in a previously described microinjection assay  <cit>  . in this assay, peptides bearing the candidate transport sequences are linked to fluorescently labeled bovine serum albumin . these potential transport substrates are coinjected into the nucleus with unlinked bsa labeled with a different fluorescent color that serves as injection control. two hours later, cells are fixed and the percentage of each fluorescent label in the nuclear compartment of individual cells determined. the relative translocation activity signifies the ratio of fluorescence of the transport substrate to the fluorescence of the injection control. selective export of the transport substrate from the nucleus yields relative translocation activities <  <dig>  as demonstrated for a transport substrate containing the nes of rev . a substrate containing the  <dig> .1-derived sequence also yielded a relative translocation activity <  <dig> . these results indicate that region  <dig> to  <dig> of  <dig> . <dig> sequence can function as a nuclear export signal.

to further characterize this nuclear export signal in  <dig> . <dig> we took advantage of a collection of weight matrices  derived for recognition of nes by bioinformatics . these matrices recognized  <dig> out of  <dig> signals of a published nes database  <cit>  at a default threshold of  <dig>  in the context of their native proteins. no match was obtained upon scanning of the  <dig> . <dig> amino acid sequence with these matrices at default threshold. this indicates that the  <dig> . <dig> sequence is distinct from the  <dig> nes represented by the matrices. however, rescanning of the  <dig> . <dig> sequence at a lower threshold  yielded a single match for matrix m <dig> , comprising amino acids 92– <dig> of  <dig> . <dig> . at default threshold the same matrix recognized a specific group of nes that includes the nes of stat <dig> and p65rela . however this matrix did not recognize the nes of pkiα or rev, which were recognized by different matrices. an artificial  <dig> . <dig> nes sequence containing leucine instead of isoleucine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> was recognized by matrix m <dig> above default score  but by no other matrices, even at reduced thresholds.

finally we investigated whether the candidate transport signal also shows nuclear export activity in the context of the complete  <dig> . <dig> protein. as shown in figure 6b, the leucine and two isoleucine residues of the  <dig> . <dig> core nes were changed to alanin and the subcellular distribution of the  <dig> .1-gfp was compared to the wildtype  <dig> . <dig> fused to gfp. the mutant  <dig> .1-gfp fusion protein localized to significantly higher levels in the nucleus than wildtype  <dig> .1-gfp . however, the nuclear proportion of the mutant  <dig> .1-gfp remained below that of unfused gfp , indicating residual nuclear export of the mutant  <dig> .1-gfp.

in summary, combined computational and functional analyses indicate that amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> act as a nuclear export signal, with amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> constituting a potential core nes. mutational analysis indicates that the leucine/isoleucine of the  <dig> . <dig> core nes contribute to but are not sole determinants of cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> . <dig> 

colocalization of  <dig> . <dig> and rev
this report demonstrates interaction of  <dig> . <dig> and rev in yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays . in these approaches, candidate interaction partners are artificially targeted to the nucleus to measure interaction-dependent reporter gene expression.

to analyse whether  <dig> . <dig> and rev interact under conditions in which they retain their natural localization behavior, we analysed cells coexpressing  <dig> . <dig> and rev for colocalization of both proteins.

to this end, we first established a hela cell line stably expressing  <dig> .1-gfp and a corresponding control cell line expressing unfused gfp. the expression of  <dig> .1-gfp for more than  <dig> passages did not affect cell growth monitored by measurement of growth curves and did not lead to cell toxicity detectable as release of lactate dehydrogenase  or atp into cell culture supernatants . furthermore, long-term expression did not alter the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> .1-gfp.

for colocalization studies, hela  <dig> .1-gfp cells and control hela-gfp cells were transfected with a plasmid directing expression of rev-cfp  fusion proteins. transfected cells were subjected to epifluorescence microscopy and z-stacks were collected. images were processed by deconvolution and multichannel unmixing, allowing separate evaluation of the spatial distribution of gfp and cfp signals. over  <dig> cells were analyzed. multichannel unmixing is a recently developed technique for separate detection of fluorochromes that exhibit significant spectral overlap in conventional fluorescence microscopy setups, such as cfp and gfp . fig. 7a shows examples of cells expressing  <dig> .1-gfp either alone  or together with rev-cfp .  <dig> .1-gfp was only visible in the nucleoli of cells co-expressing rev-cfp but not in cells lacking rev-cfp . cells coexpressing  <dig> .1-gfp and rev-cfp showed stronger nucleoplasmic gfp fluorescence than hela  <dig> .1-gfp cells lacking rev-cfp. rev-cfp retained typical nuclear/nucleolar localization  <cit>  when coexpressed with  <dig> .1-gfp, indicating that  <dig> .1-gfp does not influence localization of rev-cfp. control imaging of hela cells expressing gfp either alone  or together with rev-cfp  showed that presence of rev-cfp did not influence the gfp signal and that the cfp signal was apparent only in cells expressing rev-cfp. these results verified separation of rev-cfp and gfp signals by the multichannel unmixing routine and confirmed that the cfp-tag in rev-cfp does not affect localization of gfp.

these results indicate that rev is capable of directing  <dig> . <dig> to nucleoli and provide further evidence for interaction of rev and  <dig> . <dig> in human cells.

influence of  <dig> . <dig> on rev functions
to investigate the influence of  <dig> . <dig> on rev function, we analysed the effect of igg1- <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> .1-gfp fusion proteins on transactivation capacity of rev using a previously described rev-reporter assay  <cit> . the mrna synthesized from the reporter gene in this assay contains a region coding for red fluorescent protein  and a non-coding region with hiv- <dig> derived sequence elements mediating rev-responsiveness. these consist of multiple ins from the hiv- <dig> gag gene and the rre from the hiv- <dig> env gene. rev activity is measured by quantification of rfp reporter positive cells by flow cytometry using the gating strategy depicted in fig. 8a . experiments were performed in 293t cells because of the high transfection efficiencies achieved in these cells.

the transactivation capacity of rev in the absence of exogenous  <dig> . <dig> was set at 100%. the result of  <dig> independent experiments demonstrate an approximately 50% reduction of rev activity by coexpression of  <dig> . <dig> fusion proteins . a dose-dependent effect of  <dig> .1-gfp expression on rev activity was observed . no effect was observed for numerous other gene products of a human cdna-library tested in this assay .

in the experiment above we showed that overexpression of  <dig> .1-gfp exhibited a negative effect on the transactivation capacity of hiv- <dig> rev in human cells. isolation of  <dig> . <dig> from a human cdna library suggests that  <dig> . <dig> proteins may be produced in human cells. to target expression of native  <dig> . <dig> we decided to use rna interference. to identify inhibitors of  <dig> . <dig> expression we analysed several candidate sirnas targeted to sequences within the  <dig> . <dig> coding region and a negative control sirna that recognizes sequences located upstream of the  <dig> . <dig> coding region. an exemplary experiment is shown in fig. 9a, b. hela  <dig> .1-gfp cells were transfected with sirnas and the effects on expression of  <dig> .1-gfp monitored by flow cytometry .  <dig> .1-gfp expression levels in rnai transfected cells were determined relative to those in untransfected cells in  <dig>  cells by facs analysis. sirna- <dig> . <dig> reduced mean relative expression levels of  <dig> .1-gfp to 36%. a similar effect was observed for a positive control sirna that silences gfp . the negative control sirna  only moderately diminished mean relative expression of  <dig> .1-gfp to 81%. a similarly moderate reduction was observed for mock-transfected cells  indicating that this is caused by the rna transfection procedure. analysis of the inhibitory effect of sirna- <dig> . <dig> on  <dig> .1-gfp expression in three additional experiments yielded a mean relative expression of  <dig> .1-gfp of  <dig> % +  <dig>  , confirming the inhibitory effect of this sirna on  <dig> .1-gfp.

subsequently we investigated the effect of sirna- <dig> . <dig> and the negative control sirna-nsp in 293t cells in the rev-reporter assay described above . the negative control sirna  had no effect on rev transactivation capacity compared to mock transfected cells . in contrast, sirna- <dig> . <dig> increased rev transactivation capacity by 17% compared to mock-transfected controls. a specific enhancing effect of sirna- <dig> . <dig> was observed in three independent experiments. these results indicate that endogenous  <dig> . <dig> gene products are capable of modulating rev activity.

expression of  <dig> . <dig> proteins
database searches identified several cdnas of various lengths that contain the complete  <dig> . <dig> sequence within a predicted open reading frame . these are derived from various human tissues and cells. the predicted molecular masses of the hypothetical proteins encoded by these cdnas range from ~ <dig> kda to  <dig>  kda. this suggests existence of several human  <dig> . <dig> protein species encoded by various cdnas, rather than a single  <dig> . <dig> protein generated from a single cdna.

production of  <dig> . <dig> proteins has not been reported so far and is currently under investigation in our laboratory . in the context of this ongoing study, a monoclonal antibody  was generated against recombinant  <dig> . <dig>  indirect immunofluorescence of hela cells transfected with the igg1- <dig> . <dig> expression plasmid revealed a cytoplasmic staining pattern that was indistinguishable from that obtained with antibodies against igg <dig> . the  <dig> . <dig> mab, but not the secondary antibody, also stained untransfected hela cells, yielding a cytoplasmic, granular pattern . in western blot analysis of hela- <dig> .1-gfp cells, the  <dig> . <dig> mab recognized a band with the predicted molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda for the  <dig> .1-gfp fusion protein as well as additional proteins . these results confirm specific recognition of  <dig> . <dig> antigens by the  <dig> . <dig> mab and indicate expression of endogenous  <dig> . <dig> proteins.

the  <dig> . <dig> mab has also been used to analyze cells from different lines and primary tissues, including brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. a staining pattern similar to that in hela cells was observed for  <dig> out  <dig> cell lines analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence . western blot pagesanalysis of the cell lines/tissues investigated so far yielded a total of  <dig> distinct bands, ranging in size from >  <dig> kda to <  <dig> kda . the occurrence of these bands depended on the cell line/tissue investigated. these results confirm expression of  <dig> . <dig> proteins in human cells and tissues and suggest cell-specific expression patterns of  <dig> . <dig> proteins.

future studies are directed at identifying the full range of  <dig> . <dig> protein species with a panel of antibodies and characterizing  <dig> . <dig> expression patterns on cdna and protein levels in various cell types.

discussion
in this study we identified a cdna encoding a novel cellular gene product  that interacts with the hiv- <dig> rev protein in yeast and mammalian cells. in human cells,  <dig> . <dig> is a substrate for crm1-dependent export and shows predominant cytoplasmic localization. colocalization of rev and  <dig> . <dig> was observed in nuclei, particularly in the nucleoli, of cells expressing both proteins. overexpression and rnai experiments indicate that  <dig> . <dig> can influence transactivation function of rev.

comparison of cytoplasmic localization properties of  <dig> . <dig>  rev and pki
we demonstrate that  <dig> . <dig> interacts with crm <dig>  and shows similar leptomycin b sensitive, cytoplasmic localization behaviour as pkiα and the carboxyterminal half of rev  which are known substrates for crm1-dependent export  <cit> . these results indicate that cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> . <dig> involves crm1-mediated nuclear export.

a nuclear export signal was mapped in  <dig> . <dig> . mutation of the leucine/isoleucine residues of the  <dig> . <dig> nes only partially inhibited nuclear export of full-length  <dig> . <dig>  whereas leucine/isoleucine residues in the nes have been shown to be essential for export of rev and pkiα  <cit> . this suggests differences in the export functions of the  <dig> . <dig> nes and the nes of rev and pkiα. this conclusion is supported further by the bioinformatics analysis, which showed that the group of nes sequences recognized by the same matrix as the  <dig> . <dig> transport signal did not include the nes of rev or pkiα .

gfp fusion proteins containing a single copy of the  <dig> . <dig> nes showed weaker cytoplasmic localization than gfp fusion proteins with tandem copies of this region or full-length  <dig> .1-gfp . this suggests that cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> . <dig> does not depend solely on the functionality of a single copy of the  <dig> . <dig> nes. the formation of homo-oligomers of  <dig> . <dig>  as shown by mammalian two-hybrid analysis , could allow cooperative activity of multiple  <dig> . <dig> nes. in addition, sequences beyond the nes could also contribute to cytoplasmic localization, for example by increasing cytoplasmic retention of  <dig> . <dig>  sequences beyond the nes of  <dig> . <dig> could also promote interactions with export-enhancing co-factors, several of which have been identified so far. these include the ran-binding protein  <dig>   <cit> , nxt <dig>  <cit>  and eukaryotic initiation factor 5a . eif-5a was demonstrated to be involved in export of rev-like nes but not of the pkiα-nes  <cit> , suggesting the existence of substrate-specific export cofactors. future studies will be directed at identifying cellular interaction partners of the  <dig> . <dig> protein and investigating their influence on its export activity.

interactions of  <dig> . <dig> and rev
in this study we show that  <dig> . <dig> and rev are capable of influencing biological properties of one another.

in cells expressing  <dig> . <dig> and rev, rev can alter localization properties of  <dig> . <dig> by recruiting  <dig> . <dig> to the nucleus, in particular nucleoli. this is shown by colocalization of rev and  <dig> . <dig> in the nucleoli of cells expressing both proteins . cytoplasmic localization of  <dig> . <dig> suggests that  <dig> . <dig> interacts with rev in the cytoplasm and is then translocated together with rev to the nucleus and to nucleoli. the region of  <dig> . <dig> that mediates interaction with rev  contains the  <dig> . <dig> nes . thus crm <dig> could "bridge" interaction of  <dig> . <dig> with rev. crm1-mediated interaction with rev has been observed for several cellular proteins proposed to function as cofactors for nuclear export of rev . however, amino acid positions of rev essential for interaction with  <dig> . <dig> are located outside the rev nes, and an export-deficient nes-mutant of rev  was capable of interacting with  <dig> . <dig> . this suggests that  <dig> . <dig> does not function as an essential cofactor for nuclear export of rev.

we have demonstrated that overexpression of  <dig> . <dig> inhibits transactivation function of rev . the molecular mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect is unclear. a possible model to explain an inhibitory effect of  <dig> . <dig> on rev activity is that  <dig> . <dig> recruited to nucleoli by rev promotes association of rev and crm <dig> in inactive complexes. the strong interaction of  <dig> . <dig> with crm <dig> may increase the amount of crm <dig> associated with rev to inhibitory levels. in support of this model, experimental evidence has been obtained demonstrating that  rev associates with crm <dig> in nucleoli, influencing its mobility,  high levels of crm <dig> inhibit rev activity and  rev is capable of recruiting other crm1-interacting factors to nucleoli that are capable of inhibiting rev activity  <cit> . this model will be investigated in future experiments.

the rnai experiments suggest that endogenously expressed  <dig> . <dig> gene products can also affect rev function. as expected, the stimulatory effect of rnai-mediated inhibition of  <dig> . <dig> expression was small, since rev is known to function efficiently in 293t cells  <cit> . we attempted to study the long-term effect of inhibition of endogenous  <dig> . <dig> on rev function by establishing cell lines stably expressing sirna against  <dig> . <dig>  however, this approach was not feasible because of cell death after 2– <dig> weeks of expression of  <dig> . <dig> sirnas. this indicates that  <dig> . <dig> gene products are crucial for cell viability. on the other hand, overexpression of  <dig> . <dig> is well tolerated as demonstrated by the establishment of a cell line stably expressing  <dig> .1-gfp.

the physiological role of interaction of rev with  <dig> . <dig> is not clear yet and may be positive or negative, depending on the levels of expression of  <dig> . <dig>  at low levels  <dig> . <dig> proteins may act as a molecular chaperones of rev, counteracting the strong tendency of rev to aggregate with itself and/or preventing incorrect interactions with other cellular proteins. the occurrence of cytoplasmic cellular factors that inhibit rev multimerization is suggested by a recent report demonstrating only weak rev-rev interaction in the cytoplasm of living cells  <cit> . at high concentrations,  <dig> . <dig> may decrease transactivation function of rev, for example by sequestering rev in inactive complexes in nucleoli. inactivation of rev by  <dig> . <dig> could play a role in protecting the cells from rev-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
hiv- <dig> infection of human cells involves various interactions between cellular and viral factors . some cell types  can control hiv- <dig> replication demonstrating the impact of cellular factors on hiv infection  <cit> . identification of cellular factors that are able to interfere with viral replication will contribute to understanding of cellular defence mechanisms against viral intruders and may also lead to identification of new targets for therapeutic approaches for virus restriction. using hiv- <dig> rev as "bait" we were able to identify a previously undescribed cellular interaction partner of an hiv- <dig> protein,  <dig> . <dig>  the  <dig> . <dig> protein is exported from the nucleus by crm <dig> and accumulates in the cytoplasm. an important feature of  <dig> . <dig> is its ability to impair transactivation capacity of rev, although both proteins localize to different cellular compartments. conversely, rev is capable of affecting localization of the  <dig> . <dig> protein by recruiting it to the nuclei/nucleoli of eukaryotic cells. because of its properties we suggest naming the  <dig> . <dig> protein "risp" .

data base analyses and preliminary studies with a specific monoclonal antibody suggest that human proteins with risp sequences are expressed in various human cell types including hiv- <dig> target cells. the objective of future studies will be to characterize risp proteins, their cellular functions and their influence on rev activity and hiv- <dig> replication in different hiv- <dig> target cells.

this study represents a further step toward elucidating the network of host cell factors that interact with the hiv- <dig> rev protein and influence its functions. this study also illustrates the power of viral proteins as tools for identification and biological characterization of novel cellular factors. use of similar experimental strategies as presented here will help to gain deeper understanding of virus-cell interactions.
