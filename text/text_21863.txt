BACKGROUND
upstream open reading frames  are small open reading frames found in the 5' utr of a mature mrna, and can mediate translational regulation of the largest, or major, orf . regulation by uorfs has been studied in several individual transcripts demonstrating the importance of uorfs in such processes as polyamine production  <cit> , amino acid production  <cit> , and sucrose response  <cit> , but the biological effect of uorfs in the vaste majority of transcripts of the genome is still unclear. upstream start codons  occur in 20–30% of yeast, mammalian, and plant transcript 5' utrs  <cit>  therefore potentially thousands of genes are regulated in this manner.

the majority of characterized uorfs appear to act in an amino acid sequence-independent manner, regulating morf translation by the uorf start codon nucleotide context, by the uorf length, or by the distance between the uorf stop codon and the morf start codon, rather than by uorf-encoded peptides  <cit> . some uorfs, however, do rely on peptide sequences to mediate translational regulation of the associated morf, but few examples have been identified and characterized to date. in fungi and animals, a few genes have been shown to contain uorfs whose amino acid sequences are similar between two or more species  <cit> , but only two cases, cpa <dig>  <cit>  and samdc1/adometdc <dig>  <cit> , have demonstrated uorf sequence-dependent regulation. in plants two groups of genes, s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases  and group s basic region leucine zipper  transcription factors, have been shown to contain uorfs with similar amino acids between monocots and dicots  <cit> . in the former group, morf translational regulation is dependent on the sequence of the uorf peptide  <cit>  and overexpression of the morf in either group results in stunted or lethal phenotypes, suggesting that these genes play a critical role in growth and/or development. indeed, adometdc is required for polyamine synthesis, molecules that are implicated in essential plant functions such as cell division, embryogenesis, leaf, root, and flower development, and stress responses  <cit> .

in general, it has been difficult to carry out genome-wide surveys of conserved peptide uorfs due to poor annotation of 5' utrs. the availability of expressed sequence tags  has improved exon and intron annotation of the genomic sequence, but they are relatively short and often do not predict the entire mrna molecule, even when several ests overlap the same genomic region and can be assembled to predict one transcript. as there are very few introns in yeast transcripts, prediction of uorf conservation has been attempted in s. cerevisiae by analyzing genomic sequence upstream of predicted morf start sites  <cit> , but it is still not clear whether these uorfs are truly conserved , or are simply undergoing evolutionary drift. with the sequencing of the aspergillus nidulans genome, comparison to a. fumigatus and a. oryzae has identified  <dig> uorfs with putatively conserved start and stop codon positions relative to the morf,  <dig> of which are conserved in one of neurospora crassa, fusarium graminaerum, or magnaporthe grisea  <cit> , but the authors did not comment on whether the uorf amino acid sequences are also conserved.

with the emergence of large plant full-length cdna sequence collections  <cit> , it is now possible to adopt a comparative genomics approach to determine the prevalence of conserved amino acid uorfs in the genome and the persistence of these elements throughout eukaryotic evolution. because rice and arabidopsis shared a common ancestor 140– <dig> million years ago   <cit> , sequence similarity retained over this amount of time provides good candidates for truly conserved peptide uorf sequences. in this study we have used oryza sativa  and arabidopsis thaliana  full-length cdna sequence collections to estimate the incidence of conserved peptide uorfs in the rice and arabidopsis genomes, to determine the prevalence of uorfs within regulatory genes, and to compare evolutionary rates for uorfs versus morfs. by examining more distantly related sequences, we posit an ancient origin for select uorfs and we provide evidence for one mechanism by which uorfs can arise within genes.

RESULTS
identification of conserved peptide uorfs by comparison of rice and arabidopsis transcripts
to identify conserved peptide uorfs, we developed "uorf-finder", a perl program that first compares the morf amino acid sequence of each cdna from one collection with the morf sequences of another species' collection to identify putative morf homologs, and then compares the uorfs in the 5' utrs of the two paired sequences to identify uorfs with conserved amino acid sequences . comparison by uorf-finder of a corrected set of  <dig> full-length cdna sequences from arabidopsis with a similar set from rice resulted in the identification of conserved peptide uorfs in  <dig> arabidopsis genes and  <dig> rice genes, which together comprise  <dig> homology groups based on uorf amino acid similarity . all three of the homology groups that had been previously reported were identified by uorf-finder  <cit> . the other  <dig> conserved uorfs have not been reported previously. homologs of these  <dig> conserved uorf groups also exist in other angiosperm species .

comparison of arabidopsis homologs detects additional conserved uorfs
conserved uorfs that are not sufficiently well conserved to be detected in a rice-arabidopsis comparison could conceivably be detected in ohnologs, homologous genes arising by whole-genome duplication   <cit> , and in paralogs, homologous genes arising from segmental duplication or tandem duplication. modification of uorf-finder allowed comparison of each full-length cdna to all other cdnas in the same collection , and identified seven additional conserved uorf homology groups . six of these pairs are ohnologs, created by the most recent wgd  in an ancestor of arabidopsis  <cit> . the seventh pair is not found in syntenic regions and is most likely a paralogous pair. it appears to have arisen at about the same time as the recent wgd event because its synonymous substitution frequency  of  <dig>  is similar to the median ks of recent duplicate pairs  and is within their ks range   <cit> . the corresponding rice genes in four of the seven homology groups possess uorfs, but lack sufficient uorf sequence similarity to have been detected in the arabidopsis-rice comparison .

purifying selection maintains uorf amino acid sequences
pairwise ka/ks tests for selection on amino acid sequences were applied to each uorf homology group and their associated morfs to determine whether uorf amino acid sequences are under selective constraints similar to their associated morfs. both an approximate method  and a maximum likelihood method  were used to calculate mean pairwise ka/ks ratios for each group. a ka/ks ratio less than  <dig> implies that negative, or purifying, selection has acted on the sequence, a ratio equal to  <dig> suggests drift, and a ratio greater than  <dig> indicates that positive selection has acted on an amino acid sequence. it is also true that conservation at the nucleotide level, not the amino acid level, can drive the ka/ks ratio to one. analysis of all  <dig> homology groups showed that generally both uorfs and morfs have been under mild to strong purifying selection since the divergence of each gene pair  and these low ka/ks ratios suggest that the conservation is at the amino acid level, not simply at the nucleotide level.

one possible explanation for low ka/ks ratios in the putative uorfs invokes an incomplete splicing of the full-length cdnas for which the uorf and morf are normally fused. to address this possibility, all genbank arabidopsis ests were screened for evidence of uorf-morf translational fusions. no orfs were found to run continuously between the uorf and morf, with one exception. a fusion product  was identified between the n-terminal and central region of the uorf and the central and c-terminal region of the morf found at locus at5g <dig> . classification of this putative uorf is shown in table  <dig> for two reasons. firstly, the four uorf c-terminal amino acids that are excluded in the fusion est are perfectly conserved in monocot and dicot members, and the position of their stop codon is perfectly conserved, therefore it is difficult to explain this conservation if the uorf is not translated. secondly, the n-terminal portion of the morf that is removed in the fusion est is similar between three arabidopsis loci of the same homology group, with the start codon position also being conserved in these three members. it is likely, therefore, that the fusion est represents an alternatively spliced form of this transcript, but further characterization of this locus will be needed to support this conclusion. most of the homology groups show uorfs with conserved amino acid residues at the c-terminus and an identical positioning of the uorf stop codon . this would suggest that the full-length cdnas are fully spliced and are not erroneously predicting uorf sequences due to incomplete splicing.

conserved features of uorf sequences
the lengths of uorfs vary to differing degrees within and among homology groups, but in amino acid sequence alignments nearly all groups exhibit considerable conservation of the position of the n-terminus and/or the c-terminus, i.e., length variation is usually due to a variable region in the middle or at one end of the uorf . the amino acid sequences of some uorfs possess potentially interesting features. notably, some uorf groups possess regions rich in serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine, and others possess regions rich in lysine and/or arginine. two homology groups are particularly noteworthy: group  <dig> uorfs specify peptides with a coiled coil-helix, coiled coil-helix  domain , and group  <dig> uorfs encode peptides that are extremely serine/arginine-rich . both of these unusual peptides will be discussed in further detail below.

most genes with conserved uorfs appear to have regulatory functions
a total of 31% of morfs encoded by conserved peptide uorf loci in arabidopsis were predicted to be a transcription factor, as determined by go molecular function terms , whereas only  <dig> % of all arabidopsis loci are predicted to encode transcription factors  <cit> . thus, genes predicted to encode transcription factors are significantly overrepresented  among conserved peptide uorf loci. in each case, go terms were validated by manual annotation of protein functions using domain predictions from ncbi conserved domain and interproscan database searches  <cit> . a variety of different types of transcription factors, including bzip, ethylene response factor/apetala 2-like , basic helix-loop-helix , and homeobox proteins, are represented among conserved peptide uorf loci with no demonstrable bias. no other go terms were found to be significantly over- or under-represented in the uorf data set.

biological functions could be inferred for  <dig> of the  <dig> uorf homology groups . six groups encode transcription factor homologs and so are presumably involved in transcriptional control . five groups are likely to be involved in signal transduction, including four protein kinases and a putative calmodulin-binding protein involved in auxin response . two groups are involved in the metabolism of small molecules that regulate plant development: polyamines   <cit>  and trehalose   <cit> . one group  encodes the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of phosphocholine, which is an intermediate in biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid; phosphocholine levels influence levels of phosphatidic acid, an important physiological and developmental signal molecule  <cit> . group  <dig> putatively encodes translation initiation factor eif <dig>  which influences start codon selection, and group  <dig> encodes a ring finger protein, suggesting a role in targeted protein turnover by ubiquitination. of the remaining  <dig> groups,  <dig> encode predicted proteins of unknown function,  <dig> encodes an ankyrin-repeat protein, and  <dig> encodes an amine oxidase. thus, all but two families of conserved uorf genes whose functions are known or can be inferred potentially play a regulatory role in the biology of plants.

genes with conserved uorfs were preferentially retained after whole genome duplication
since the most recent wgd event in the arabidopsis lineage, only 14% of the original gene pairs present in the ancestral tetraploid have been retained as a duplicate pair in the extant arabidopsis genome, i.e., for the remaining 86% of ancestral gene pairs, one member has been lost  <cit> . among  <dig> ancestral gene pairs that possessed conserved uorfs at the time immediately following the genome duplication,  <dig>  pairs have been retained in the present arabidopsis genome , which is significantly higher than the genome-wide average . the conserved uorf was retained in both copies of each of the twelve retained duplicate pairs. retention of these  <dig> uorfs in both paralogs suggests that they act in cis, consistent with the expectation that uorfs typically control translation of downstream morfs on the same rna molecule  <cit> .

the overrepresentation of transcription factors among conserved uorf loci could be due, in part, to preferential retention of transcription factor recent duplicates   <cit> , but this alone does not account for the high frequency of predicted transcription factors among the uorf loci. when duplicate history bias is removed by calculating go term frequencies of the pre-genome-duplication set of loci, transcription factors are still overrepresented .

conserved angiosperm uorf peptide sequences in primitive plants and other eukaryotes
to determine whether any of the  <dig> uorf homology groups conserved between rice and arabidopsis might also be present in other eukaryotes, we searched for uorf sequences in all genbank eukaryotic ests. amino acid sequences similar to four homology groups  were detected in non-angiosperms. group  <dig> was found only as distantly as a fern ; group  <dig> was found as far from angiosperms as the green algae ; group  <dig> was found in an animal ; and group  <dig> uorf sequence was found in primitive plants, animals, fungi, and a slime mold . another algal sequence  from the genbank non-redundant database was identified belonging to group  <dig> . the group  <dig> uorf homolog found in a x. tropicalis est was also found in a genomic contig sequence  <cit>  in which the uorf homolog is flanked by genes that are more similar to animal sequences than to any known plant sequences. thus, this group  <dig> uorf homolog most likely exists in the xenopus genome rather than being an est library contaminant.

sequences similar to group  <dig> arabidopsis and rice uorfs were found in most eukaryotes, but transcript sequence following the uorf varied among the different lineages. all land plant uorfs were associated with macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1-like  morf sequences while the morfs downstream of the group  <dig> uorf homologs in nematodes and arthropods code for an unknown protein and a putative mannosyl transferase, respectively . available est sequences for each of the group  <dig> uorf homologs in mammals, fungi, algae, and slime mold end shortly after the conserved peptide uorf, suggesting that in these eukaryotes the uorf homolog is not associated with a morf and is simply a short orf. this is further supported by more than  <dig> human ests that end at the same position and include a polya sequence. in the sea squirt lineage a putative morf is present in the est sequences, but a full-length cdna sequence will be needed to further investigate this possibility.

although there is variability in the sequences found downstream of group  <dig> uorfs, three features of these uorf homologs are relatively well conserved: the length of the predicted uorf, the relative positions of four cysteine codons, and the positions of two introns . the length of the uorf peptide ranges from  <dig> amino acids in haemonchus , to  <dig> amino acids in humans, and length is even more highly conserved within each of the land plant, arthropod, nematode, fungal, and vertebrate lineages . four cysteine residues consistently align in all eukaryotes, with nine amino acids separating the first and second cysteine residues, as well as the third and fourth cysteine residues, whereas 11– <dig> residues separate the second and third cysteines. two intron positions are perfectly conserved among the land plants, vertebrates, and at least one member of the fungal lineage. the first intron lies between the third and fourth amino acids following the first conserved cysteine position, and the second intron lies between the fourth and fifth amino acids following the fourth conserved cysteine position . the first and/or second intron positions are present in dictyostelium, algae, and some fungi, but are absent in nematodes, arthropods, and sea squirts.

the four cysteines are part of a putative coiled coil-helix, coiled coil-helix  domain , also found in three small yeast proteins, cox17p, cox19p, and mrp10p. cox17p and cox19p are required for assembly of functional cytochrome oxidase and mrp10p is homologous to a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal protein. a hypothetical human gene, chch domain  <dig> , is also similar to the group  <dig> uorf, as determined by blast similarity searches.

phylogenetic relationships among group 8-like orfs
fungal, animal, and plant representatives of each chch-containing orf were identified using a blast search, and their evolutionary relationships were inferred using a bayesian phylogenetic analysis . animal mrp10p-like , debaryomyces group 8-like , and dictyostelium cox19p-like  sequences were more divergent than other sequences, causing long branch attraction  <cit> . thus, these sequences were removed from the analysis to prevent tree topology distortion. five distinct clades were observed, which we refer to as cox17p-like, cox19p-like, mrp10p-like, chchd7-like, and uorf group 8-like . all clades but one  contain representatives from fungi, animals, and plants and are strongly supported, showing branch order probabilities greater than  <dig> , which suggests that these sequences emerged in a common eukaryotic ancestor and have since diverged in the three lineages. mrp10p-like sequences do not strongly group independently of other branches , which could be due to highly divergent amino acid sequence represented by relatively long branches. the tree shows that the group 8-like proteins are a distinct clade from other chch domain proteins , and that chchd7-like proteins are more closely related to group 8-like members than to other chch-containing proteins . the tree topology also indicates that cox17p-like and cox19p-like genes are more closely related to each other than to other chch proteins .

a separate phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> group 8-like sequences shows that most cluster into five taxonomic groups  with strong branch support  in all but the fungal lineage . sea squirt sequences group with one of two branchiostoma sequences with weak branch support . dictyostelium, sea urchin , and one further branchiostoma sequence do not group with any of these with weak support . sea squirt, branchiostoma, and sea urchin sequences should be more similar to other deuterastomes  than other organisms, but the short group 8-like sequence alignment could prevent resolution of correct evolutionary relationships of some groups . despite weakly supported branches, there is strong support for independent clustering of the arthropods, nematodes, vertebrates and plants, as expected.

although two branchiostoma group 8-like sequences  suggest that there has been a duplication event within this lineage, there is no evidence for maintenance of ancient group 8-like gene duplications occurring within the plant, vertebrate, nematode, arthropod, or fungal lineages. in arabidopsis both the recent and ancient duplicates from two wgd events have been lost from the genome. only the mesostigma genome contains two group 8-like transcripts. their short branch lengths indicate that this duplication occurred relatively recently and it is possible that insufficient time has passed for loss of the second copy.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis by uorf-finder of 5' utrs in full-length cdnas from two distantly related plant species, rice and arabidopsis, identified conserved peptide uorfs in  <dig> arabidopsis loci that comprised  <dig> uorf homology groups and in  <dig> rice loci that comprised  <dig> homology groups, increasing the number of known conserved uorf homology groups from two to  <dig> and providing useful, new information for investigations of regulatory biology. because full-length cdnas derived from both arabidopsis and rice only represent a fraction of all nuclear genes, not all conserved uorfs are expected to be detected by this approach. extrapolation to the whole arabidopsis genome suggests that it possesses approximately  <dig> to  <dig> genes with conserved peptide uorfs that are also conserved in the rice genome . an additional  <dig> conserved peptide uorf genes are predicted among arabidopsis loci with retained duplicates from the most recent wgd event. in all, there are likely to be approximately 99– <dig> genes, or  <dig> – <dig> % of all protein-coding genes, with conserved peptide uorfs in the arabidopsis genome. because short conserved uorfs  would not have been detected by uorf-finder, this is a conservative estimate.

to find additional conserved uorfs, more extensive collections of full-length cdna sequences will need to be developed and/or 5' utrs predicted from genomic sequence will be required. as full-length cdna sequence resources become available for other plant species, such as maize  <cit>  and poplar  <cit> , it should be possible to identify additional conserved uorfs that might be specific to taxonomic groups, such as monocotyledons or dicotyledons. similarly, analysis of ancient tetraploidy events in species such as poplar and maize might be able to identify uorfs conserved between retained duplicates.

conserved uorf genes are regulatory genes
based on the study of a few hundred genes, it has been suggested that uorfs are usually associated with morfs that encode proteins that regulate cell growth  <cit> , but a genome-wide study of upstream augs  found no correlation of uaug-containing transcripts with any particular gene ontology  molecular function term in mammalian transcripts  <cit> . these observations did not differentiate between sequence-dependent and sequence-independent uorfs. our analysis shows that genes encoding transcription factors are overrepresented among genes predicted to encode conserved peptide uorfs, representing almost one third of the  <dig> arabidopsis loci as compared to 6% of all genes. moreover, nearly all genes whose function can be reasonably inferred appear to play some regulatory role in the biology of plants.

do conserved peptide uorfs mediate feedback translational regulation by small regulatory molecules?
certain eukaryotic conserved peptide uorfs are known to control translation of a downstream morf in response to a metabolic product such as arginine or polyamines  <cit> . in the case of the fungal arginine-regulated carbamoyl-phosphate synthase subunit, a uorf codes for the arginine attenuator peptide that responds to increased arginine concentrations by causing ribosomes to stall near the 3' end of the uorf, interfering with ribosome scanning and translation of the downstream morf  <cit> . a similar mechanism has been elucidated for the regulation of adometdc in which the uorf peptide interferes with the termination of uorf translation in a polyamine-dependent manner  <cit> . in plants, sucrose is a signaling molecule that controls not only the transcription of many genes, but also translation of a class of bzip transcription factors via their conserved uorf, suggesting the possibility of sucrose interaction with a uorf-encoded peptide to regulate translation downstream  <cit> .

our analysis identified not only these previously known examples of genes involved in pathways exhibiting small molecule feedback in a uorf sequence-dependent manner, but several additional genes that might also act via this mechanism. one is the conserved group  <dig> uorfs, which are present in genes that encode phosphoethanolamine n-methyltransferase , the key enzyme in phosphocholine  biosynthesis. recently, nmt <dig> has been shown to contain a uorf that differentially affects translation of the morf in response to exogenously added choline  <cit> . this effect is observed when the uorf start codon is abolished but it remains to be determined whether the response to choline is uorf sequence-specific. intriguingly, the group  <dig> uorf peptide is rich in arginine and serine . a variety of arginine-rich peptides 15– <dig> amino acids long with  <dig> or more arginines bind to specific rna sequences  <cit> . the predicted group  <dig> uorf peptide has 5– <dig> arginines in a 16– <dig> amino acid region, well within this range, suggesting the possibility that it might bind to a specific rna sequence, perhaps in peamt/nmt transcripts. the fact that the group  <dig> uorf peptide was also found in xenopus suggests that its regulatory role is widespread in eukaryotes.

another example is homology group  <dig>  whose morfs are predicted to encode trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase ; trehalose-6-phosphate is postulated to regulate sugar metabolism in plants  <cit> . in summary, sucrose, polyamines, phosphatidic acid, and trehalose-6-phosphate are possible regulators of translation of downstream morfs through interaction with conserved uorfs. also interesting in this light are group  <dig>  which specifies an auxin-induced calmodulin-binding homolog, and group  <dig>  which encodes a bhlh transcription factor that is believed to be subject to translational control through its conserved uorf by spermine synthase  <cit> . spermine is a polyamine signal molecule necessary for normal plant growth and defense responses.

as mentioned, six conserved uorf families specify transcription factors, one of which is regulated by the small signaling molecule sucrose. in plants, transcription factors often act quantitatively to control target gene expression proportionate to transcription factor concentration  <cit> . therefore, it is interesting to consider the possibility that translational control of transcription factor protein levels could be mediated by interaction of a conserved uorf peptide with a metabolite. this might be an effective means for quantitatively modulating the levels of expression of a pathway or network of downstream genes, for instance, in response to changing physiological or environmental conditions. this logic can equally be applied to other key control proteins and their uorfs.

how is translational control mediated by conserved peptide uorfs?
if conserved uorf peptides can regulate morf levels in response to small molecules, they are clearly analogous to rna sensors and riboswitches that sense small molecules and regulate transcript translation accordingly  <cit> . it is interesting to think of conserved peptide uorfs too as sensors of cellular, physiological, or developmental conditions. although the role of conserved uorfs as 'sensors' of cellular metabolites has been clearly established in the cases of polyamine, sucrose, and arginine concentration, it is still not clear how uorf peptides gauge cellular conditions. uorf peptides could affect morf translation by interacting directly with the ribosomal complex, by associating with other proteins that influence the translational machinery, and/or by stabilizing or destabilizing rna secondary structures in the 5' utr that impede or promote morf translation. given the variety of uorf peptides represented in the  <dig> homology groups, each of these possibilities could occur one or more times.

it is perhaps interesting to note also that the uorfs of  <dig> homology groups are rich in serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine. these amino acids are potential targets for phosphorylation that conceivably could promote or inhibit ribosome stalling or initiation at downstream morfs. as mentioned above, lysine/arginine-rich motifs could function in rna binding  <cit> .

effect of nonsense-mediated decay on uorf transcripts
because uorfs create a premature termination codon , the nonsense-mediated decay  system might target uorf transcripts for degradation. yoine et al  <cit>  carried out a microarray analysis of plants mutant in the upf <dig> ortholog, which is required for nmd.

among  <dig> genes that yoine et al identified that accumulate transcripts at more than twice the level in the upf <dig> mutant as in wild type arabidopsis, we found representatives of seven uorf homology groups , suggesting that these uorf transcripts are susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay. the uorfs in these groups might work in a manner analogous to the uorf arginine attenuator protein  in the fungal cpa <dig> transcript. the cpa <dig> transcript exclusively exhibits increased levels of degradation via nmd when the aap inhibits translation termination in response to high levels of arginine, ultimately decreasing translation using a two-pronged approach  <cit> . similarly, the above-identified plant uorfs could intensify translational inhibition of their associated morfs by both blocking the ribosome physically and inducing the nmd pathway.

evolutionary emergence of uorfs and a 'transcriptional fusion' model
very little is known about how uorfs arise. in the extant rice and arabidopsis genomes, sequences homologous to uorfs identified by uorf-finder were observed only in 5' utrs and never as part of another morf, within 3' utrs, within introns, or in non-transcribed regions. possible origins of 5' utr orfs include  fragmentation of morf sequences,  creation of an aug or alternate start codon by random mutation within the 5' utr and subsequent selection for the peptide sequence, and  relocation of other orf sequences within the genome to the 5' utr or upstream region of a given gene and subsequent transcriptional fusion of the two orfs.

transcriptional fusions occur in an estimated 2% of adjacently transcribed mrnas in the human genome  <cit> . the evolutionary history of uorf homology group  <dig> suggests a stable transcriptional fusion model leading to uorf emergence in plants, arthropods and nematodes. group  <dig> uorfs are associated with three independent morfs in the land plant, arthropod and nematode lineages, while the vertebrate, slime mold, algal, and fungal small orfs that are orthologous to group  <dig> uorfs do not seem to be associated with morfs. given the phylogenetic relationships among these species  <cit> , the most parsimonious explanation for the evolutionary origin of group  <dig> uorfs is that they originated as a small orf transcribed independently of a morf. subsequently, this small orf gene was displaced via genome rearrangements or transposition events to regions upstream of three independent large orfs resulting in transcriptional fusions of the two previously independent transcripts. the uorfs and morfs in the plant, nematode, and arthropod lineages have remained associated within the same transcript for 300– <dig> my, therefore these transcriptional fusion events seem to be stable and perhaps biologically advantageous. evidence for other uorf emergence models, such as morf fragmentation or de novo creation, will require further analysis of closely related organisms.

potential dual role for uorf proteins
uorfs can regulate specific morf protein expression in trans when the cis uorf is intact  <cit>  but it is still unclear whether uorf proteins can play additional roles in the cell. small proteins, similar in length to uorfs, play a role in plant development and could also be involved in plant defense  <cit> . potentially, uorfs could affect such processes independently of their role as a translational regulator. homology group  <dig> uorfs are largely conserved in length, sequence, and intron position across most eukaryotes, but in fungi, algae, slime mold, and vertebrates, the associated morf seems to be absent. the absence of the morf and strong conservation of the uorf amino acid sequence over one billion years in these eukaryotes indicates that, in plants, this protein could act as both a regulator of morf expression and as a trans acting factor in the cell.

group  <dig> uorfs contain peptides similar to rs motifs found in sr proteins. sr proteins are a family of proteins required for alternative and constitutive pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . a subset of these proteins, shuttling sr proteins, have not only been implicated in splicing but have also been shown to stimulate translation of a reporter gene when fused to the same transcript  <cit> , analogous to a uorf-morf associated pair. it is possible then, that group  <dig> uorf proteins could also play a dual role, as a translational regulator and trans factor.

similarly, some uorfs in mammalian genomes might adopt these dual roles and further characterization of conserved mammalian uorfs  <cit>  could resolve a dual role model.

applications
ka/ks analyses suggest that conserved peptide uorfs are under mild to strong negative selection and might therefore be useful for resolving orthology and paralogy of specific gene pairs. for example, phylogenetic studies have sometimes failed to identify all members within a uorf homology group when only considering the morf sequence . although the bhlh transcription factor domain occurs in the morf of all three group  <dig> members, none were identified in the original studies, and only two of the three members have been included in the latest description of arabidopsis bhlh family members  <cit> .

further characterization of conserved peptide uorfs and their functional mechanisms might also provide useful tools for creating inducible or repressible expression vectors in plants. adometdc <dig>  bzip <dig>  and peamt/nmt <dig> protein levels are regulated by conserved uorfs in a metabolite-dependent manner  and other conserved uorfs might also regulate morf translation in response to cellular compounds, such as tppases. if this is the case, further functional characterization of conserved peptide uorfs could provide the tools necessary to build constructs that are quickly inducible or repressible at the translational level under various conditions.
