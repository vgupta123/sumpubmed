BACKGROUND
methyl-dna binding proteins are connecting dna methylation to transcriptional silencing  <cit> . up to now, six methyl-dna binding proteins could be identified in vertebrates  <cit> . mecp <dig>  mbd <dig> and mbd <dig> can be found in large chromatin complexes containing histone deacetylase activity  <cit>  whereas mbd <dig> is involved in dna mismatch-repair  <cit> . mbd <dig> has been shown to repress transcription in cell culture  <cit>  and recruits the histone h3-k <dig> methyltransferase setdb <dig> to the chromatin assembly factor caf- <dig> during s phase  <cit> . mbd <dig>  which can bind methylated dna  <cit> , is a transcriptional repressor recruiting a nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase complex  to methylated cpg dinucleotides  <cit> , whereas mammalian mbd <dig>  which is not able to bind methylated dna  <cit>  is an integral component of nurd  <cit> . kaiso, a transcriptional repressor protein, can bind directly to cpg methylated dna even though it lacks a conserved methyl-dna binding domain  <cit> . kaiso is a component of a subpopulation of mecp <dig> complexes that lack mbd <dig>  <cit> .

the drosophila gene mbd2/ <dig> encodes a protein, which shares high homology to mammalian mbd <dig> and mbd <dig>  <cit> . due to differential splicing, drosophila mbd2/ <dig> is expressed in two isoforms, the smaller one is lacking part of the putative methyl-dna binding domain  <cit> . the large isoform is expressed during early development, whereas the small isoform can only be detected during late embryogenesis  <cit> . in insect cells expressing only the small mbd2/ <dig> isoform, this protein was found to be associated with components of the drosophila nurd complex  <cit> . moreover, this protein could repress transcription effectively in transfected drosophila cells  <cit> .

the nurd complexes of vertebrates are a heterogeneous group of complexes containing both histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodelling activities  <cit> . nurd complexes comprise at least seven proteins. the atp- dependent nucleosome-remodelling activity is mediated by mi- <dig>  which contains a swi2/snf2-type helicase/atpase domain, two chromodomains and two phd fingers  <cit> . the related mta <dig>  mta <dig> and mta <dig> proteins have been found in various complex preparations  <cit> . mta <dig> was originally identified as being overexpressed in metastatic carcinomas  <cit> . the histone deacetylases hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> and the two histone binding proteins rbap <dig> and rbap <dig> form the histone deacetylase core of nurd complexes. finally, as mentioned above, mammalian mbd <dig> is an integral component of at least some nurd complexes  <cit> .

strikingly, the drosophila genome contains clear homologues for all verterbrate nurd proteins. recombinant drosophila mi- <dig> was shown to have atpase and nucleosome mobilization properties  <cit> . in drosophila the hdac gene rpd <dig> is important for segmentation of the embryo  <cit> . drosophila p <dig>  a wd- <dig> protein, is homologous to the histone deacetylase-associated proteins rbap <dig> and rbap <dig>  <cit> . finally, drosophila mta-like displays extensive homology to the vertebrate mta proteins  <cit> .

the strong conservation between vertebrate nurd complexes and the drosophila nurd complex implies a conserved function during the animal development. in previous studies cell lines were analysed that express only the small isoform of mbd2/ <dig>  lacking part of the putative methyl-dna binding domain and a drosophila specific domain. in order to analyse isoform-specific differences of mbd2/ <dig> and their ability to bind nurd proteins, we now extend our analysis to both isoforms in drosophila embryos.

RESULTS
mbd2/ <dig> is associated with drosophila nurd proteins
an association of drosophila mbd2/ <dig> with the nurd complex has been suggested previously  <cit> . however, these experiments were done in vitro or with protein extracts from tissue culture cells that express only the small isoform of mbd2/ <dig>  in addition, only a limited number of nurd proteins were analysed. to confirm the association between mbd2/ <dig> and nurd in drosophila embryos we size-fractionated nuclear protein extracts from 2– <dig> h or 0– <dig> h wild type embryos, respectively, by superose  <dig> gel filtration chromatography. proteins from individual fractions were then separated by standard sds-page and analysed by western blotting using antibodies directed against known homologous subunits of the nurd complex. mi- <dig> and mta-like, which are homologues of subunits that are specific for vertebrate nurd complexes  <cit>  cofractionated with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> mda when extracts derived from early embryos  were applied . when extracts of late embryos  were analysed, mi- <dig> and mta-like were detected in fractions  <dig> to  <dig>  which correspond to an apparent molecular weight of approx.  <dig> mda . this result indicates that the formation of nurd is developmentally regulated during embryogenesis. additionally, we found a precise cofractionation of the large isoform of mbd2/ <dig>  with mi- <dig> and mta-like in both cases. the small mbd2/ <dig> isoform  present in extracts derived from late embryos likewise cofractionated with mi- <dig> and mta-like. this suggests a close association of both mbd2/ <dig> isoforms with the drosophila nurd complex. the rpd <dig> and p <dig> proteins also cofractionated with mbd2/ <dig> isoforms, but they were also found in fractions of lower molecular weight . this is in agreement with the fact that both rpd <dig> and p <dig> are also components of other chromatin related complexes  <cit> .

interactions between mbd2/ <dig> and nurd homologues
to analyse the association between mbd2/ <dig> and the nurd complex in more detail and to identify direct nurd interaction partner of mbd2/ <dig> we first used a gst-pulldown assay. in order to eliminate unspecific interactions with nurd proteins, we established highly stringent assay conditions. this was achieved by assessing the interactions between radioactively labeled sv <dig> large t antigen  and a number of control gst fusion proteins. when we used an incubation and washing buffer with high salt and detergent concentrations, significant amounts of sv <dig> large t were precipitated by p <dig> only , which is known to be a strong interactor of the large t antigen  <cit> . residual binding detected with some of the other proteins  was considered background.

we then performed the mbd2/3-nurd interaction assay using these conditions and observed strong interactions only between the long and small mbd2/ <dig> isoforms  and p <dig>  to confirm the association between mbd2/ <dig> and p <dig> in drosophila embryos we immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts with mbd2/3-specific antibodies and with myc-specific control antibodies. precipitates were analysed by western blot for the presence of p <dig> and gaga factor. this revealed a specific association of mbd2/ <dig> with the drosophila nurd homologue p <dig>  but not with the unrelated gaga factor .

a weaker interaction could also be detected between the small mbd2/ <dig> isoform and mi- <dig> . neither rpd <dig> nor mta-like binding exceeded the background level defined by our pilot experiment with sv <dig> large t protein . our results thus identified p <dig> and mi- <dig> as the direct interaction partners of mbd2/ <dig> in the nurd complex. in addition, our results from the gst-pulldown assay indicate that drosophila mbd2/ <dig> forms dimers or multimers, similar to mammalian mbd <dig> and mbd <dig>  <cit> . to discriminate between the latter two possibilities we expressed a recombinant long mbd2/ <dig> isoform and rpd <dig> in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. extracts from infected cells were subjected to superdex  <dig> gel filtration and fractions were analysed by western blot. the  <dig> kda rpd <dig> protein eluted in fractions corresponding to molecular weights ranging from  <dig> kda to  <dig> kda, which suggested that rpd <dig> exists as monomers or dimers in solution . in contrast, the  <dig> kda mbd2/ <dig> isoform showed a strikingly different elution profile . the long mbd2/ <dig> isoform eluted in a broad peak ranging from more than  <dig> kda up to high molecular weight fractions . no mbd2/ <dig> was detected in fractions corresponding to the expected size of mbd2/ <dig> monomers or dimers. this result is consistent with our earlier observation that mbd2/ <dig> forms distinct aggregates in embryonic nuclei  <cit>  and suggests that the protein efficiently oligomerises to form high-molecular weight complexes in solution.

to confirm these interactions in an independent set of experiments we also analysed the association between mbd2/ <dig> isoforms and the nurd proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay. in agreement with our previous results, growth on highly selective  plates was only observed upon co-expression of the mbd2/ <dig> small isoform and either mi- <dig>  mbd2/ <dig> long isoform or p <dig>  and upon co-expression of both mbd2/ <dig> isoforms. these interactions were confirmed by x-gal staining of filter-lifted yeast colonies . in these assays the two mbd2/ <dig> isoforms differed only with regard to mi- <dig> binding . however, differential binding could be eliminated by a slight reduction in the stringency of the assay , which suggested that both isoforms of mbd2/ <dig> are capable of interacting with mi- <dig>  consistent with our gst-pulldown assays no interaction could be detected between the mbd2/ <dig> long isoform and rpd <dig> or mta-like .

next we sought to delineate the domains that mediate the association between the mbd2/ <dig> isoforms and their interacting proteins. to this end, we generated several mbd2/ <dig> deletion mutants and tested their interaction with other proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay. in a first series of experiments we tested the mbd2/ <dig> mutants for their ability to interact with p <dig>  this identified the region between residues  <dig> and  <dig> of the mbd2/ <dig> long isoform as the p <dig> interaction domain . we also delineated the domain that mediates the interaction with mi- <dig>  our experiments revealed a strongly reduced interaction between a mbd2/ <dig> small isoform derivative lacking the coiled-coil domain and mi- <dig> . it has been shown previously that vertebrate mbd <dig> and mbd <dig> form homo- and heterodimers via their n-terminal mbd domain and their c-terminal coiled-coil like sequences  <cit> . our findings might reflect a direct interaction between the coiled-coil domain and mi- <dig> or a requirement for efficient mbd2/ <dig> multimerization for mi- <dig> interaction. in conclusion, our results identify distinct regions in the mbd2/ <dig> protein that mediate protein-protein interactions with other nurd proteins.

in order to analyse the architecture of the nurd complex, we performed a detailed yeast two-hybrid analysis including additional bait and prey constructs for nurd proteins. bait constructs for mi- <dig>  rpd <dig>  p <dig> and both mbd2/ <dig> isoforms and prey constructs for mta-like, rpd <dig>  p <dig>  and both mbd2/ <dig> isoforms were co-transformed in all possible combinations and transformation was confirmed by growth on non-selective plates . colonies were then replicated onto highly selective plates that allow growth only upon interaction between the two expressed proteins . finally, we performed a filter lift assay followed by x-gal staining to confirm the interactions . in addition to the results presented above, we found strong interactions between p <dig> and all nurd proteins. we also observed a homotypic interaction for p <dig> but no homotypic interaction for rpd <dig>  to confirm the specificity of the interactions, we tested most of the constructs reciprocally by changing the bait and prey vectors for expression of nurd proteins and mbd2/ <dig> isoforms. this data allows the establishment of a more detailed model of the nurd complex. fig. 4d summarizes the data from all experiments. p <dig> interacted with mi- <dig>  mta-like, rpd <dig>  and both mbd2/ <dig> isoforms. the small isoform of mbd2/ <dig> interacted with mi- <dig> as well as with the large mbd2/ <dig> isoform. homodimerization of p <dig> and mbd2/ <dig> is not shown in the model.

discussion
it has been previously suggested that mbd2/ <dig> is associated with the drosophila nurd complex  <cit> . this study determined that the small isoform mbd2/ <dig> coelutes with some putative drosophila nurd subunits during fractionation of extracts derived from a drosophila cell line. we have now extended this analysis to show that both isoforms of mbd2/ <dig> coelute with nurd homologues during fractionation of embryonic extracts. this data provides further evidence for a direct interaction between mbd2/ <dig> and the nurd complex.

using several independent assays, we have demonstrated that mbd2/ <dig> engages in homotypic interactions to form multimers. this effect is consistent with the formation of foci in embryonic nuclei  <cit>  and also reminiscent of the interactions described for vertebrate mbd <dig> and mbd <dig>  <cit> .

in addition, our data provides new insights into the association between mbd2/ <dig> and nurd. for example, we have shown that p <dig> appears to be the primary interaction partner of mbd2/ <dig>  we also observed a strong interaction between the small isoform mbd2/ <dig> and mi- <dig>  but not between mbd2/ <dig> small isoform and mta-like or rpd <dig>  additionally, we found interactions between p <dig> and all nurd proteins, as well as a p <dig> homotypic interaction. the last finding is consistent with the fact that in the vertebrate nurd complex the two p <dig> homologues rbap <dig> and rbap <dig> were identified as integral components  <cit> . we note that the vertebrate nurd complex also contains the two rpd <dig> homologues hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  <cit> ; unexpectedly, we were not able to detect any homotypic interaction of rpd <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid assay. one explanation could be that the dose of the two co-expressed rpd <dig> bait and prey proteins could interfere with the reporter gene activity due to their inherent histone deacetylation activity. however, the gel filtration assay revealed that the  <dig> kda rpd <dig> protein eluted in fractions corresponding to molecular weights ranging from  <dig> kda to  <dig> kda, which suggested that rpd <dig> can interact homotypically .

it is possible that more complex interactions are involved in the assembly of the nurd complex but they might not have been detectable under the stringent conditions of our assays. the interaction between mbd2/ <dig> and mi- <dig> detected in our assays could also contribute to the specific association between mbd2/ <dig> and the nurd complex.

the interaction between mbd2/ <dig> and p <dig> could promote the assembly of specialized chromatin structures in the fly. p <dig> is a wd- <dig> repeat protein that is involved in many aspects of chromatin organization  <cit> . for example, p <dig> has been shown to be a component of the drosophila caf- <dig> complex that promotes nucleosome assembly  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> is also contained in the nurf chromatin remodelling complex  <cit>  and in the e complex that regulates homeotic gene expression  <cit> . a mutant drosophila allele for p <dig> is not available, but results obtained from arabidopsis mutants with decreased levels of a p <dig> homologue indicate that the protein plays an important role in stabilizing epigenetic chromatin structures  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of this study was to identify the interacting partners of the drosophila methyl-dna binding protein mbd2/ <dig> within the drosophila nurd complex. we identified p <dig> and mi- <dig> as the primary interacting partners. we also found homo- and heterotypic interactions of the mbd2/ <dig> isoforms, similar to vertebrate mbd <dig> and mbd <dig>  additionally, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that p <dig> is able to specifically interact with all other nurd proteins and can form homotypic interactions. our data provides for the first time information about the architecture of the drosophila nurd complex. this allows us to develop a structural model of the nurd complex.
