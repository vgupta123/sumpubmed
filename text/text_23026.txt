BACKGROUND
the neurotransmitter norepinephrine  is synthesized, stored, and released by a distributed collection of neurons in the brainstem, by neurons of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system and by endocrine cells of the adrenal medulla  <cit> . the powerful and widespread actions of ne include the regulation of metabolism, cardiovascular function, memory, emotion, attention, arousal, and appetite  <cit> . these actions are supported by the plasmalemmal ne transporter   <cit>  an integral membrane protein that binds and clears ne following release  <cit> . net is a clinically important drug target, particularly for the treatment of mood and cognitive disorders, including depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  <cit> . net is also targeted by psychostimulants, including cocaine and amphetamines  <cit> . net dysfunction has been linked to attention, mood and cardiovascular disorders  <cit> . the importance of net for normative physiology and behavior has been amply confirmed with studies of net knock out  mice that display altered seizure susceptibility and opiate/cocaine sensitivities, as well as maladaptive responses to social and cardiovascular stressors  <cit> .

given the powerful control exerted by net over ne signaling, it is not surprising that the net protein itself has been found to be highly regulated  <cit> . changes in net distribution and/or activity arise through the acute engagement of signaling pathways, that in turn may support the actions of psychostimulants  <cit> ) as well as chronic stressors  <cit> . net regulatory pathways impact both transporter surface trafficking and catalytic activity and are supported by multiple ser/thr and tyr kinases  <cit>  and phosphatases  <cit> , as well as interacting proteins  <cit> . net regulation appears to be supported by interactions with multiple associated proteins. thus, net has been shown to physically associate with pp2ac, syntaxin 1a, hic- <dig>  pick- <dig>  14-3- <dig> proteins, and α-synuclein  <cit> . how these interactions are coordinated is unclear. one possibility is that membrane subdomains may serve as a site at which distinct net associations are acquired or stabilized. for example, in placental trophoblasts, net localizes, in part, to lipid raft-containing membrane subdomains  <cit> . surprisingly, similar data are currently lacking for neuronal net.

in neuronal preparations and endocrine cell lines, nets localize to both the plasma membrane as well as to intracellular vesicles, consistent with either biosynthetic transport vesicles or recycling compartments  <cit> . in the brain, net surface expression in axonal varicosities is most prominent in fibers that express high levels of the catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase , whereas net localizes to cytoplasmic compartments in axons relatively deficient in th, suggesting a possible link of surface trafficking to ne synthesis capacity  <cit> . interestingly, several investigators have provided evidence that net traffics via dense core vesicles, the vesicles responsible for ne storage  <cit> . thus, kippenberger and colleagues  <cit>  provided evidence that in pc <dig> cells net-containing membranes co-fractionate with organelles competent for ne storage, presumably golgi-derived large dense core vesicles  <cit> . consistent with these findings, schroeter and coworkers  <cit>  provided evidence that the predominantly intracellular localization of net in rat adrenal chromaffin cells involves localization to large dense core granules. whereas schroeter and coworkers also noted that net is enriched at presynaptic sites colocalized with dopamine-beta hydroxylase, a protein component of dense core vesicles  <cit> , these studies were not conducted at sufficient resolution to permit distinctions between subcellular compartments. savchenko et al. demonstrated calcium-dependent increases in surface net in neurons  <cit> , strengthening the hypothesis that net may be trafficked to the surface of ne neurons by fusion of dense core vesicles  <cit> .

like vesicular ne release, fusion of net storage vesicles with the plasma membrane depends on snare machinery  <cit> . thus, botulinum c <dig> toxin-mediated cleavage of syntaxin 1a reduces net surface expression  <cit> . moreover, net grossly colocalizes with the snare protein syntaxin 1a in both cns and sympathetic axons in vivo  <cit> . possibly, net stored on dense core vesicle membranes can traffic to the plasma membrane upon ca2+ influx, leading to incorporation of net at release sites. however, leitner and colleagues  <cit>  provided evidence, using bovine splenic nerve preparations, that net and the bona fide dense core vesicle marker, vmat <dig>  are localized to distinct populations of axonally transported vesicles. this study did not address or compare the organelles responsible for storing net and ne at presynaptic terminals. therefore, previous gross colocalization of net and dbh at presynaptic compartments could be due to net sorting to small dense core vesicles at these presynaptic terminals, since the biogenesis of small dense core vesicles occurs in the terminals  <cit> .

to gain a better understanding of the subcellular distribution of net, we developed a rodent-specific, net monoclonal antibody  and here demonstrate its suitability for the detection of native net by both immunocytochemical and immunoblot techniques. we document net- <dig> utility and specificity via staining of noradrenergic neurons in wildtype and net knockout mice in situ. further, we utilize this reagent in combination with other probes of net and net-associated proteins to gain insight into the subcellular distribution of net within scg axons and at the plasma membranes of scg boutons. our findings underscore a presynaptic enrichment of surface net that colocalizes with syntaxin 1a and, in part, with lipid rafts. importantly, using quantitative biochemical and immunocytochemical methods, we detect a clear segregation of net from ne-containing dense core vesicles marked by vmat <dig> 

RESULTS
development and characterization of a rodent net-specific monoclonal antibody
given sensitivity and species detection issues inherent in our available net-directed antibodies, we sought to generate a monoclonal antibody against the mouse net  suitable for rodent-targeted western blots, immunoprecipitation studies, and immunocytochemistry. we selected a sequence in mnet  based on predicted antigenicity, and lack of conservation with other monoamine transporters such as the serotonin transporter  and dopamine transporter . this peptide is found in the n-terminal intracellular domain. among net paralogs, however, the mnet sequence chosen is highly conserved, differing from the rat net  at only one amino acid . figure 1a provides an alignment of the net amino termini from several species as well as the orthologs dat and sert from mouse, rat and human  <cit> . blast searches of mammalian protein databases yielded no significant matches to the epitope except those found in net paralogs . following immunization with the coupled peptide , we developed multiple hybridoma cell lines that produced antibodies yielding positive signals in peptide-based elisa assays . from these data, we selected a hybridoma  for further characterization and use it throughout the experiments presented in this report.

immunoblots using cell lysates from cos cells expressing rnet demonstrate that net- <dig> recognizes rnet despite the one amino acid change relative to the mouse net peptide . however, net- <dig> fails to detect human net , which differs from mnet at two consecutive amino acids . to verify whether net- <dig> recognizes mnet in native tissue, we prepared post-nuclear fractions  from wild type mouse cortex and from mice with mnet genetically deleted .  <cit> . our blots identify a ~ <dig> kda band present in wildtype but not net ko samples . these results demonstrate that net- <dig> recognizes rodent nets via western blots of extracts from both heterologous expression systems and native tissues.

detection of specific net expression in mouse brain noradrenergic neurons
the distribution of noradrenergic neurons and processes in rodent brain is well-known  <cit>  and the distribution of net has been previously described in these pathways using polyclonal antisera  <cit> . to verify the utility of net- <dig> for immunocytochemistry, we assessed the staining pattern obtained using net- <dig>  marking catecholamine neurons in parallel using anti-tyrosine hydroxylase . as shown in a low magnification view  of the locus ceruleus , net- <dig> immunoreactivity colocalizes extensively with staining for th  and extends into dendrites . higher magnification  views are shown in figure 2d–f. net- <dig> and th staining similarly colocalize in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , an area rich in ne axons and varicosities   <cit> . ne fibers are more dense than in the ventral bnst  as compared to the dorsal division   <cit> . confirming this pattern, we observed a higher density of net fiber labeling in the vbnst  as compared to the dbnst . inset panels of figure 2g–l using a stack from multiple confocal sections  demonstrate net labeling along individual fibers. both th and net antigens appear enriched in punctate domains along individual fibers, presumably the well-known beaded varicosities that comprise ne release sites  <cit> . in these fields, some fibers are th positive but show no net immunoreactivity . these fibers are most likely dopaminergic fibers that express th but lack net and which are known to innervate this region  <cit> . to demonstrate specificity of the net- <dig> reagent, we stained vbnst sections from wildtype and net ko mice . although the pattern of th staining in sections from net ko  appeared similar to that from wild type mice , no net staining was evident in the net ko . similar negative staining results were obtained with sections incubated without primary antibody or pre-absorbed with peptide .

subcellular distribution of neuronal net in relation to vmat <dig> in mouse brain
having validated the utility of net- <dig> antibody for detection of mouse brain net in multiple assays, we examined the hypothesis that net is sorted to dense core vesicles that harbor vmat <dig>  figure  <dig> illustrates the distribution of net  and vmat <dig>  immunoreactivity in the mouse hippocampus, focusing on the ne rich hilus of the dentate gyrus. labeling of net in these fields is similar to that achieved with polyclonal net antisera  <cit> . although colabeling was evident in most neuronal varicosities, colocalization was not uniform as some net-positive elements displayed low levels of vmat <dig> immunoreactivity and some varicosities appeared to have high levels of vmat <dig> relative to net. regardless, staining in the hippocampus, as in the lc and bnst, is absent in the net ko , confirming net- <dig> specificity. these light-level immunocytochemical data confirm expression of net at discontinuous axonal in the cns and indicates that the relative abundance of net and vmat <dig> differs across individual fibers.

net distribution in cultured superior cervical ganglion  neurons
although we achieved evidence of specific net labeling within or on neuronal membranes, the small size of cns ne varicosities, unfortunately, precluded quantitative immunocytochemical analysis of net distribution. previously, we observed that net is enriched in sympathetic varicosities in situ  <cit> . therefore, we continued our studies using scg neurons that elaborate profuse noradrenergic fibers in culture  <cit> . furthermore, scg preparations present large varicosities extending laterally from axonal membranes . as with the cns preparations described above, we verified the specificity of net- <dig> in the scg cultures and then examined net subcellular distribution in relation to multiple markers of vesicles and membrane subdomains. figure  <dig> shows single confocal sections and corresponding dic images of cultured scgs focused on either the cell bodies  or the processes . in the cell bodies, net labeling surrounds the nucleus in a pattern consistent with golgi compartments. a low level of immunoreactivity was associated with the plasma membrane, most evident at sites where cell bodies contact one another . importantly, net- <dig> labeling exhibited a punctate pattern throughout scg processes . to demonstrate specificity of net- <dig> labeling in this preparation, we stained scg cultures prepared from net ko mice . as shown in figure 4h and 4k, the ko neurons lack net staining.

next, we compared the distribution of net as detected with net- <dig>  which requires permeabilization, to that of net  <dig>  a polyclonal net antibody that targets the net 2nd extracellular loop and which therefore reports net expression at the cell surface when used in the absence of detergent  <cit> . whereas net- <dig> detects transporter throughout neuronal processes , net  <dig> reveals net surface expression particularly evident at boutons . these boutons store npy  and thus may represent one class of ne neurons that innervate smooth muscle  <cit> .

scg net does not colocalize with markers of dense core vesicles 
the studies above indicate that the net- <dig> labeling associated with scg neurites, in the presence of detergent, represents largely intracellular pools of transporter-containing membranes, whereas boutons are the primary sites of surface net expression. to test if intracellular net resides on large dense core vesicles, we double stained scgs for net and npy . npy labeling was enriched in the cytoplasm of boutons and relatively low in abundance within processes, relative to that observed for net . importantly, we observed no colocalization with net in boutons  suggesting net is not sorted to large dense core vesicles . we considered the possibility that bouton resident net vesicles might represent small dense core vesicles  which originate at presynaptic sites. upon fusion with the plasma membrane, ldcvs release npy and ldcv membrane proteins, including vmat <dig>  are endocytosed to form sdcvs  <cit> . just as we observed for npy, vmat <dig> labeling was also enriched in the cytoplasm of scg boutons and in relatively low abundance in processes as compared to net . importantly, within the bouton of double labeled neurons, vmat <dig> displayed little apparent colocalization with net . additionally, we found little if any colocalization of synaptophysin, which labels an endocytic compartment through which sdcvs  <cit>  . together these findings support the contention that in scg boutons, net is not sorted to any class of dense core vesicles.

the evaluations presented above of net colocalization with vmat <dig> and other proteins are qualitative, based on visual inspection of chromatic changes in labeling when using multiple fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies. to investigate colocalization quantitatively, we plotted the normalized intensities for net and vmat <dig>  or net and synaptophysin  in both axonal regions lacking varicosities as well as in boutons, and found no evidence of correlation. to achieve a quantitative evaluation of colocalization, we implemented an unbiased analytical method that has been validated for determination of protein colocalization in intact cells  <cit> . stanley's group reasoned that if two proteins are on the same organelle or interacted, then the paired pixel intensities should vary in synchrony over space  <cit> . this method, termed intensity correlation analysis  plots the normalized pixel intensity for a particular protein  in relation to the normalized intensity of the other protein . the quantitative index produced in the ica analysis is termed the product of the difference from the mean, pdm  <cit> . in graphical form, the normalized paired pixel intensity of each protein  is plotted against the pdm of the two proteins of interest, producing a distribution of points between the values of  <dig> and  <dig> on the y axis and between - <dig>  to + <dig>  on the x axis . pixel intensities that indicate colocalization are associated with positive values of the x axis. for statistical analysis, the number of pixels with a positive × value is divided by the total number pixels. this procedure yields the intensity correlation quotient  which can be analyzed by a nonparametric sign test  <cit> . analysis of net and vmat <dig> yielded a nonsignificant icq value  consistent with net and vmat <dig> as localized to different membrane compartments. the icq value for net and synaptophysin in axons is low, though a significant association was identified  .

in figure 5m and 5n, we present the spatial distribution of pdm values  using a pseudocolored scale. pixels with positive pdm values are in orange  and negative pdm values in purple . below this display, we present the standard two-color merge of the same region of the axon. whereas net and vmat <dig> show no extensive regions of colocalization, for net and synaptophysin, limited regions within the axon appear to demonstrate positive colocalization . however, when we performed these analyses in boutons, we detect no evidence of net colocalization with vmat <dig>  npy, or synaptophysin , further confirming segregation of net from ldcvs in axons as well as sdcvs in boutons.

immunoisolation studies support net and vmat <dig> localization to distinct scg vesicles
to evaluate the distribution of net and vmat <dig> via an alternative approach, we performed immunoisolation experiments of scg membranes. to establish the utility of net- <dig> for immunoprecipitations, we incubated antibody with detergent extracts of cortical synaptosomes and probed net with the same antibody . immunopreciptated net migrates at ~ <dig> kda in total extracts , migrating on sds-page just above the heavy chain of net- <dig> igg  . additionally, we also immunoprecipitated intact organelles from hypotonic lysates of mouse cortical synaptosomes . the  <dig> kda net band observed in wildtype  but not net ko lysates demonstrates specific net recovery . in figure 6c, we present results of organelle isolation from cultured scgs using net- <dig>  vmat <dig> or na/k atpase antibodies for membrane isolation, followed by blots of net and vmat <dig>  net- <dig> isolated membranes contained only background levels of vmat <dig> . conversely, vmat2-coated beads recovered negligible, background levels of net proteins. antibody-free beads yielded negligible background net isolation. these findings support the contention derived from staining experiments in scg cultures that net and vmat <dig> are segregated to distinct membrane compartments.

colocalization of net with scamp <dig> and syntaxin 1a in scg axons
recently, scamp <dig> has been identified as an n-terminal sert and dat interacting protein, with suggestions of a role in transporter sorting or trafficking  <cit> . it seemed likely that scamp <dig> might also associate with net as well, and thus we explored net and scamp <dig> colocalization in scg cultures . scamp <dig> immunoreactivity was readily detected in both axons and boutons. in boutons, we observed no statistically significant colocalization with net . likewise, neither the pdm image of a representative axon nor the two color merge of the same segment  gives evidence of strong colocalization between net and scamp <dig>  the ica plot  appears symmetric with a "cloud" of points in the lower quadrant. nonetheless, the icq value  reflects a significant association  that supports the possibility that a small fraction of net resides on scamp2-positive organelles or that a minor fraction of scamp <dig> resides on net-transport vesicles.

we have previously demonstrated that net colocalizes with syntaxin 1a in sympathetic varicosities in situ  <cit> . indeed, we gained clear evidence in the scg cultures for extensive colocalization of syntaxin 1a and net  at the surface of boutons. since it is unknown whether net and syntaxin 1a are sorted to distinct axonal transport vesicles, we examined the correlation of these two proteins in axons. visually, we observed apparent colocalization of net and syntaxin 1a. indeed, the distribution of pixel intensities for axonal net and syntaxin 1a  demonstrates a positive spatial correlation for this labeling. ica/icq analysis confirms a significant association of axonal net and syntaxin 1a . when a similar analysis was performed in boutons, again the two proteins exhibited a highly statistically significant colocalization , consistent with previous biochemical studies  <cit> . these findings indicate that net is sorted to syntaxin 1a containing vesicles such that both snare protein and transporter can be deposited at the plasma membrane upon membrane fusion.

net localizes to both lipid raft and non-lipid raft membranes in scgs
plasma membranes are not homogenous lipid bilayers but rather contain discrete subdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids termed lipid rafts  <cit> . interestingly, biochemical fractionation and pharmacological studies of placental trophoblasts demonstrate that a portion of nets exists in lipid rafts  <cit> . whether neuronal net localizes to these domains has not been established. cholera toxin-b  targets cell-surface localized gm <dig> gangliosides that are enriched in lipid-rafts  <cit> . we used fluorescent ctx-b to label either nonpermeabilized or detergent-permeabilized scgs to determine if net localizes to lipid raft compartments. as shown in figure 8a–d, fluorescent ctx-b labeling of scg processes and boutons under nonpermeabilized conditions was nonuniform as expected of lipid raft membrane subdomains. remarkably, all sites labeled with ctx-b under nonpermeabilized conditions displayed net <dig> immunoreactivity . however, the converse was not true, demonstrating that net in the plasma membrane of boutons localizes to both raft and non-raft membranes. in permeabilized conditions, ctx-b labeling of processes revealed little colocalization with net . consistent with these observations, the spatial distribution of pixel intensities for net and ctx-b  demonstrated a positive correlation for nonpermeabilized boutons whereas axonal labeling under permeabilized conditions exhibited a random pattern is observed . ica/icq analysis yielded a significant association of net and ctx-b in nonpermeabilized  as compared to permeabilized axonal preparations  . these findings support the targeting of net proteins to lipid rafts once transporters have been inserted into the presynaptic membrane.

discussion
in this report, advance the understanding of net subcellular distribution in neuronal membranes. we desired to combine immunohistochemical and biochemical strategies, and thus needed first to develop and characterize a high-affinity, rodent net-directed antibody. our two previous net rabbit polyclonal antibodies, net <dig>  <cit>  and net  <dig>  <cit>  detect rodent net in intact tissue, but do not reliably detect net by western blotting nor allow for net immunoprecipitation. previously, we developed an anti-human net monoclonal antibody that has the required sensitivity for blotting studies, but fails to detect rodent net due lack of epitope conservation across species. here, we demonstrate that the net- <dig> monoclonal antibody provides for immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical localization of mouse net with sufficient sensitivity to detect net in native preparations. lack of signal in assays using tissues obtained from net ko mice amply demonstrates the specificity of the net- <dig> reagent.

as expected, net- <dig> stains well-known areas of noradrenergic cell bodies and projections, including the lc, bnst, and hippocampus, where fiber staining for both vmat <dig> and net exhibits a characteristic varicose appearance. interestingly, some net-positive fibers appeared to lack, or contained little vmat <dig>  possibly an indication of low capacities of these fibers for vesicular ne release. em-immunocytochemical studies  <cit>  in the cortex have shown that net expression patterns exhibit one of two patterns, being either largely surface localized or predominantly intracellular. surface localized net is found in fibers with high levels of th whereas intracellular net predominates in fibers with little or no detectible th immunoreactivity. possibly the vmat2-poor, net labeled fibers we observe in the hippocampus also reflect fibers with reduced ne release capacity. further studies utilizing em approaches and dual labeling for net/vmat <dig> should be helpful in addressing this possibility as well as advancing the possibility that such a pattern may change with stress or other states of behavioral activation  <cit> .

because cns ne fibers and their varicosities are too small for detailed compartmental analyses, we turned to scg cultures. in scg cell bodies, net labeling displays a pattern consistent with er/golgi localization as well as a low amount of surface expression at regions where cell bodies appear to contact with each other. as previously shown <cit> ., net ectodomain antibodies reveal surface expression at varicosities but not on axonal plasma membranes. in contrast, when we labeled net- <dig> under permeabilizing conditions, we observed uniformly intense staining of net throughout axons. these data suggest that net- <dig> labeling in scg axons primarily reveals the presence of intracellular net transport vesicles. interestingly, the intensity of intracellular staining was much lower in single scg boutons, whose diameter  permitted an unprecedented level of analysis of net distribution in relation to other presynaptic membrane proteins. an additional benefit of studying net distribution in these large boutons is that they project laterally from the axons, permitting visualization of both axonal and presynaptic organelles in the same field.

to study net colocalization with synaptic membrane proteins, we took advantage of a recently developed method for determining colocalization of proteins in intact cells . these synaptophysin-rich vesicles can fuse in a calcium-dependent manner and in some ne cells can also store and release acetylcholine  <cit> . however, we did not detect any colocalization of net with synaptophysin at boutons and we have not detected any colocalization of net with the presynaptic choline transporter that is present in these terminals and presumably is sorted to slmvs . nonetheless, ica/icq analysis of permeabilized scg axons showed that a small but significant fraction of synaptophysin containing membrane colocalizes with net. interestingly, these synaptophysin/net containing organelles do not appear to concentrate at boutons  and thus could represent constitutive trafficking organelles that deliver net to boutons. indeed, synaptophysin has been suggested to traffic via constitutive transport organelles  <cit> . regardless, these synaptophysin- and net-containing vesicles do not appear to lead to the sorting of net to sdcvs or slmvs following fusion as we did not observe any colocalization of net with synaptophysin inside boutons. possibly, net-and synaptophysin-positive membranes could also represent retrograde compartments formed from the fusion of separate net and synaptophysin-containing endosomes that are destined for degradation. further biochemical studies of surface-labeled net vesicles should help address this issue.

an additional issue underlying our studies is whether proteins that associate with net do so early in their trafficking itinerary or only after plasma membrane insertion. a contribution to this question can be seen in our analysis of the distribution of net to syntaxin 1a with net. like net, syntaxin 1a has uniformly high levels in permeabilized axons relative to the boutons. indeed, in permeabilized preparations, we observed significant and extensive colocalization of net with syntaxin 1a. from previous work, it is known that syntaxin 1a is required for basal/regulated net cell surface expression and that net and syntaxin 1a physically associate  <cit> . our findings are consistent with the existence of trafficking vesicles that contain both net and syntaxin 1a, providing an opportunity for physical interactions that ultimately serve to regulate net activity and channel states at the plasma membrane. recent studies with a c. elegans net homolog, , reveals that a transporter n-terminal gfp tag can disrupt syntaxin 1a interaction and lead to altered channel states and membrane potential, providing evidence for a physiological relevance of the syntaxin 1a/transporter interaction in vivo  <cit> .

finally, we examined the distribution of net in relation to two markers of membrane subcompartments that could support transporter net trafficking and/or regulation, scamp <dig> and ctx-b. a previous study reported that scamp <dig> physically interacts with both sert and dat. sert and scamp <dig> colocalize in intracellular compartments, as well as at the plasma membrane where it may regulate sert activity  <cit> . we found scamp <dig> to be highly expressed in scg processes where we detected a very low, but significant, level of net colocalization suggesting that scamp <dig> may participate in sorting and export of the transporter from the cell soma. like dat, net lacks a py motif  <cit>  and thus net/scamp <dig> associations at the plasma membrane could facilitate nedd <dig> ubiquitination, similar to the role suggested for scamp <dig> in nedd <dig> ubiquitination of egf receptors  <cit> . we detected, membrane patches at the surface of boutons that were enriched for both net and scamp <dig>  compared to the total level of scamp <dig> in boutons, this distribution was quite limited. additional studies that explore conditions leading to net ubiquitination should be helpful in further evaluating the extent and role of net/scamp <dig> associations. placental cells that express net localize a portion of net to lipid rafts as detected through membrane fractionation analyses  <cit> . in scg neurites examined under permeabilized conditions, net does not colocalize with ctx-b. in boutons, in contrast, the transporter clearly localizes to surface-labeled, ctx-b positive membrane domains. as a portion of net in ctx-b unlabeled membranes, we suggest that net may transit between these domains as part of a regulatory cycle. future studies that explore the dynamics of these associations and that take advantage of the reagents and paradigms employed in our study should further extend our understanding of the regulation of net membrane trafficking.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings support the hypothesis that scg net is segregated prior to transport from the cell body from proteins comprising large dense core vesicles. once localized to presynaptic boutons, net does not recycle via vmat2-positive, small dense core vesicles. finally, once net reaches presynaptic plasma membranes, the transporter localizes to syntaxin 1a-rich plasma membrane domains, with a portion found in cholera toxin-demarcated lipid rafts. our findings indicate that activity-dependent insertion of net into the scg plasma membrane derives from vesicles distinct from those that deliver ne. moreover, net is localized in presynaptic membranes in a manner that can take advantage of regulatory processes targeting lipid raft subdomains.
