BACKGROUND
two major types of calcium dependent, pore forming cytolysins of the repeats in toxin -family, called alpha- and ehec-hemolysin  were described in strains of escherichia coli  <cit> . both types of hemolysins are encoded by polycistronic operons consisting of four genes arranged in the order of hlycabd  <cit> . the product of the hlyc gene is involved in activation of the hemolytic toxin the product of the hlya gene. the gene products of hlyb and hlyd together with tolc are involved in secretion of the hemolysin through the bacterial cell wall  <cit> .

ehec-hemolysin is encoded on non-conjugative plasmids in strains of enterohemorrhagic e. coli  that cause hemorrhagic diseases in humans  <cit> . in contrast, α-hemolysin is frequently associated with human uropathogenic e. coli  strains  <cit>  and with enterotoxigenic , shigatoxigenic  and enteropathogenic e. coli  strains that cause diarrhea and edema disease in animals  <cit> .

in upec the α-hly genes are found on large chromosomal pathogenicity islands   <cit> . the upec o <dig>  and o <dig>  strains carry each two α-hly operons located on different pais  <cit> , which contain divers junctions and adjacent sequences. this suggests that these loci have evolved independently  <cit> . genetic analysis of chromosomal α-hly operons revealed differences in 5' flanking sequences and toxin expression  <cit> .

plasmid-encoded α-hly genes were found associated with epec o <dig> strains  <cit> , as well as with etec and shiga toxin 2e  producing stec strains  <cit> . α-hly plasmids of e. coli were found to differ widely in size, incompatibility groups and conjugational transfer ability  <cit> . so far, only two plasmid α-hly operons were completely sequenced. the first is located on the  <dig> kb non-conjugative plasmid phly <dig> from a murine e. coli strain  <cit> . the other is located on the  <dig> kb conjugative plasmid peo <dig> of a human epec o <dig> strain  <cit> . interestingly, despite the differences between phly <dig> and peo <dig>  the dna sequence of their α-hly operons are  <dig> % similar while the sequence of the upstream regulatory hlyr region is  <dig> % similar  <cit> . importantly, the plasmid-inherited α-hly are less similar  to the chromosomally inherited α-hlycabd located on pai i  and pai ii  of the e. coli strain  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, chromosomally and plasmid-inherited α-hly operons also differ also for their 5' regulatory hlyr region. these findings suggest that the plasmid and chromosomal α-hly operons have evolved in parallel.

studies on hemolysins of other bacterial species revealed similarities between the e. coli α-hemolysin genes and the enterobacter, proteus, morganella and mannheimia operons  <cit> . codon usages base composition studies suggested that the α-hlycabd genes of e. coli were originated from proteus, morganella or mannheimia species  <cit> . transposon-like structures found in the neighborhood of plasmid phly <dig> and peo <dig> encoded α-hly operons suggest that these were acquired by horizontal gene transfer  <cit> .

the fact that the α-hlycabd genes and their adjacent regions on phly <dig> and peo <dig> were highly similar to each other prompted us to investigate the genetic relationship between plasmid and chromosomal inherited α-hly operons in more strains of e. coli and in enterobacter cloacae. our results indicate that plasmid α-hly operons are highly similar regardless of differences in the plasmid backbone sequences, bacterial host and their source, suggesting that they have evolved from a common origin.

RESULTS
characterization of α-hly plasmids in e. coli strains
nucleotide sequence analysis of the peo <dig> α-hlycabd operon and its 5' region revealed high similarity to the corresponding dna segment of the α-hly plasmid phly <dig>  <cit> . since peo <dig> and phly <dig> differ in their origin, size and conjugative transfer, we investigated if plasmid α-hly operons have a common origin and evolved independently of chromosomal α-hlycabd genes in e. coli.

in order to explore the genetic relationship between plasmid α-hly genes we investigated five α-hly plasmids originating from canine etec strains and four plasmids of porcine etec and stec strains . α-hemolysin plasmids were detected by dna-hybridization of southern blotted plasmid dna as described in material and methods . the size of α-hly plasmids from dogs, pigs, mouse, cattle and human origin varied between  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb and other than peo <dig>  peo <dig> and peo <dig> all other plasmids were found transferable by conjugation . plasmid profile analysis has shown that the α-hly-plasmids are frequently found together with other large plasmids .

in addition, we investigated four e. coli and an e. cloacae strain with chromosomal α-hly operons . a blast search using peo <dig>  and phly <dig>  sequences between hlyr and hlyc and downstream of hlyd revealed no similarity with sequences of chromosomal α-hly genes in strains cft <dig> , uti <dig>  and  <dig> .

analysis of the plasmid and chromosomal upstream α-hly operons
based on the peo <dig> dna sequence  we developed specific primers for amplification of fragments within the hlyr, and hlyr - hlyc regions . in addition, we developed specific pcrs for the upstream hlyc sequences of the chromosomal α-hemolysin operons in pai i and pai ii of strain  <dig>  <cit>  . we performed pcr analysis of all strains carrying plasmid and chromosomal α-hly operons; strains carrying α-hly-plasmids peo <dig> and phly <dig> and  <dig> served as positive controls. the results are summarized in table  <dig> 

a) pcr products of different lengths were obtained with these primers depending on the dna template 

primers 1f/r are specific for the upstream hlyc region in peo <dig> and yielded a pcr product of  <dig> bp . pcr products of the same size were obtained with all strains carrying α-hly plasmids, except 84/s ; restriction enzyme analysis revealed all the fragments had a similar hinfi profile . primers 1f/r gave no products using e. coli strains carrying chromosomally encoded α-hly as template with the exception of the e. cloacae strain kk6- <dig> which yielded a pcr product; dna sequencing revealed a  <dig> bp fragment  .

primers 32f/r spanning the region between hlyr and the "phly152" segment amplify a  <dig> bp product in peo <dig>  . a pcr product of the same size was obtained with peo <dig> and derivative plasmids as well as with plasmids peo <dig> , peo <dig> and peo <dig> . primers 32f/r yielded pcr products of  <dig> bp with peo <dig>  , peo <dig> and peo <dig> . all amplicons of a given size , yielded a similar hinfi restriction pattern . strains with chromosomally encoded α-hemolysin gave no products in the 32f/r pcr, as well as strain 84/ <dig> s carrying plasmid peo <dig> .

primer pair 44f/r  is specific for hlyr and amplified related sequences in all e. coli carrying α-hly plasmids except peo <dig>  the hlyr pcr product was  <dig> bp   for all plasmids except for peo <dig>  peo <dig>  peo <dig> and peo <dig> which generated amplicons of about  <dig> bp . the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp size pcr products yielded similar hinfi restriction profiles, respectively. strains with chromosomally inherited α-hly genes were negative for hlyr sequences .

none of the strains with α-hly plasmids, or the e. cloacae strain kk6- <dig> yielded pcr products with primer pairs 81f/r and 72f/r, that are specific for pai i and pai ii α-hemolysins   <cit> . all strains with chromosomal α-hly except kk6- <dig> produced pcr products with one or both of these primer pairs . taken together, the pcr typing indicated that all plasmid α-hly except peo <dig> were similar for the regulatory regions located upstream of the hly-genes which differed from the chromosomal α-hly operons.

genetic analysis of the region between hlyr and hlyc in α-hly plasmids
a  <dig> bp dna segment that carries a promoter  for expression of α-hly-genes is located directly upstream of the hlyc gene in plasmid phly <dig>  <cit>  . a  <dig> bp region with  <dig> % sequence homology was found upstream of hlyc in peo <dig>  <cit> . the "phly152" region is not present in e. coli strains containing chromosomal α-hly genes  <cit>  . sequences highly homologous to a large part of the "phly152" region were found in all α-hly plasmids investigated here, except peo <dig>  comparison of the complete  <dig> bp "phly152" dna stretch of plasmids peo <dig> , peo <dig> , peo <dig> , peo <dig>  and peo <dig>  revealed similarities from  <dig> % to 100%. interestingly, a  <dig> bp fragment with 93% similarity to the "phly152" segment was found upstream of hlyc in the e. cloacae strain kk6- <dig> .

sequences specific for hlyr , a regulatory region located about  <dig> bp upstream of the α-hly determinant in phly <dig>  <cit>  were present in all α-hly plasmids except peo <dig>  the hlyr regions of five representative plasmids  were analyzed and compared to each other . short dna sequences that were reported to be involved in regulation of α-hly expression located inside hlyr, i.e regulatory sequences a and b  <cit>  and the "operon polarity suppressor   <cit> , were identified in the corresponding hlyr region of the five plasmids. a clustal analysis performed with a  <dig> bp segment of the hlyr region beginning with the regulatory sequence a to the end of the hlyr region revealed  <dig>  to 100% similarity between these five plasmids.

is <dig> and is <dig> elements are present in the α hly-upstream region of plasmid hly
according to the length of pcr products obtained for the region located between hlyr and hlyc genes three groups of α-hly plasmids were established . "group 1" is represented by peo <dig>  its homologues from other e. coli o <dig> strains and by peo <dig> and peo <dig>  "group 2" is represented by phly <dig>  peo <dig> and peo <dig>  "group 3" is formed by plasmids peo <dig>  peo <dig> and peo <dig> from porcine strains. two strains with α-hly plasmids peo <dig> and peo <dig> showed individual patterns by pcr-typing . in order to explore the differences between the major groups of α-hly-plasmids we determined the nucleotide sequence of the region located between hlyr and hlyc of three representative plasmids, namely peo <dig> , peo <dig>  and peo <dig>  .

major differences between the α-hly plasmids in the region between hlyr and hlyc caused by insertion of is <dig> and is <dig>  while "group 1" plasmids  carry no is elements all "group 2" plasmids  carry an is <dig> element inserted directly downstream of the 3' end of hlyr  in peo <dig>  a  <dig> bp part of the is <dig> element was previously described in phly <dig>   <cit> , it is  <dig> % identical to the corresponding is <dig> element of peo <dig>  the is <dig> elements in peo <dig> and phly <dig> are inserted at the dna same site and are both flanked by the duplicated 5' cctgg 3' dna sequence.

plasmids belonging to "group 3", which were all from pig strains , carry two is elements in the region between hlyr to hlyc. in peo <dig>  the  <dig> bp is <dig> is inserted immediately downstream of the hlyr internal sequence 5' aacaaaatt 3'. this  <dig> bp dna stretch is repeated at the right hand end of the inserted is <dig> and followed by the  <dig> bp residual 3' end of the hlyr region . the is <dig> element of peo <dig> is  <dig> % similar to that of peo <dig> and inserted at the same position as in "group 2" plasmids peo <dig> and phly <dig> 

investigation of hlyr-hlyc region of stec strains of porcine origin
we used the primers specific for the region between hlyr to hlyc  to investigate  <dig> α-hemolysin/stx2e stec strains from diseased pigs or pork meat  <cit> . pcr products were obtained from all. according to the length of the amplicons generated with primers 1f/r, 32f/r and 44f/r all but one strain showed patterns indicating the presence of a "group 2" or "group 3" plasmid with is-elements in the region between hlyr and hlyc . the pcr-profiles were closely associated with serotypes of strains causing edema disease in pigs  suggesting that α-hly plasmids are conserved in these strains.

a) size of the pcr products  with primers 1f/r, 32f/r, 44f/r and 99f/r as described in tables 1+  <dig>  digestion of pcr products by hinfi resulted in identical patterns between strains corresponding to the size of the pcr products obtained 

b) strains isolated from feces of diseased pigs  <cit> 

c) strains isolated from pork meat  <cit> 

sequence analysis of the hlyc gene of plasmid and chromosomal α-hemolysin
the fact that α-hly plasmids were similar for the regulatory sequences upstream of the α-hly operon prompted us to analyze the coding sequence of seven plasmid hlyc genes, namely peo <dig> , peo <dig> , peo <dig> , peo <dig> , peo <dig> , peo <dig> , and peo <dig>  . we used clustal w analysis to compare the dna sequences of the plasmid hlyc genes and the chromosomal hlyc genes of strain  <dig>  pai  and pai ii  uti <dig> , cft <dig> , j <dig>  and that of the e. cloacae strain kk6- <dig> . all plasmid hlyc sequences, except that of peo <dig>  showed  <dig>  to 100% nucleotide sequence homology to each other and were grouped into one cluster . a second cluster  was formed by the chromosomal and peo <dig> hlyc genes . the hlyc gene encoded by peo <dig> was most similar to that of pai ii from strain  <dig> . the hlyc genes of all other α-hly plasmids showed  <dig> - <dig> % homology to chromosomal hlyc genes of e. coli. the amino acid  sequences of hlyc translation products revealed five aa-exchanges  in the  <dig> aa-sequence that were closely associated with the origin  of the e. coli hlyc genes .

the hlyc gene of the e. cloacae strain kk6- <dig> was more distant for its nucleotide and aa sequence from both the e. coli plasmid and chromosomal hlyc gene clusters and most similar to chromosomal pai i, pai ii  and peo <dig>  hlyc genes .

comparison of nucleotide sequences of plasmid and chromosomal α-hlya genes
comparing the nucleotide sequences of hlya revealed significant differences between chromosomal and plasmid genes. by blast search, a  <dig> bp stretch of the hlya gene  was found only 91% similar to the corresponding regions of the chromosomal hlya genes from pai i  and pai ii .

in order to explore the differences between plasmid and chromosomal hlya genes we have developed pcr primers  for amplification of this dna region. the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding  <dig> bp pcr products from strains with α-hly plasmids and from e. cloacae strain kk6- <dig> was determined. the results are presented in fig.  <dig>  except for peo <dig>  all plasmid encoded hlya internal sequences were very similar to each other with a maximum difference of  <dig> % . in contrast, chromosomal hlya genes showed differences of up to  <dig> % when compared to each other . the  <dig> aa hlya translation products showed aa-exchanges at positions  <dig> and  <dig> that were associated with the e. coli plasmid or chromosomal origin of the genes .

the nucleotide sequence of the hlya region on plasmid peo <dig> was found closely related to the chromosomal hlya gene of strain uti <dig> , and showed 5-6% sequence differences to all other α-hly-plasmids. interestingly, the e. cloacae hlya gene sequence was found 99% similar to that of plasmids peo <dig> and peo <dig> and more distantly related to the e. coli chromosomal hlya genes .

is <dig> is present downstream of hlyd in strains carrying α-hly plasmids
it was suggested that the hlycabd operons were spread in e. coli by mobile genetic elements  <cit>  and a truncated is <dig> segment of  <dig> bp was found located closely and downstream of the hlyd gene in plasmid peo <dig>  <cit> . in order to investigate the other α-hly plasmids for the presence of this element we developed pcr-primers  encompassing a  <dig> bp stretch of dna starting inside hlyd and ending inside the is <dig> sequence. all α-hly plasmids except peo <dig> yielded a pcr product. none of the strains carrying chromosomal α-hly genes reacted positive with this pcr . the nucleotide sequence of the  <dig> bp amplicons from nine α-hly plasmids  yielded  <dig> bp products with primers 99f/r, that showed similar hinfi digestion profiles  to those of the sequenced plasmids  indicating that the hlyd-is <dig> region is conserved in these strains.

transcriptional analysis of plasmid and chromosomal α-hlya genes
we investigated if the presence of is elements in the regulatory region upstream hlyc has an affect on transcription of the α-hlya gene. phenotypically, all strains with α-hly plasmids showed large and clear zones of hemolysis on blood agar plates similar to that found with strains carrying chromosomally inherited α-hly genes. an exception was made for strains 536- <dig>  and the wildtype strain 695/ <dig> , which generated small, turbid zones of hemolysis on blood agar plates  <cit> .

we compared the transcriptional activity of  <dig> e. coli strains carrying plasmid and chromosomal α-hly operons by analyzing the mrna transcription level of the α-hlya gene in a relative quantification  assay by real-time pcr. the e. coli icda housekeeping gene was used as a standard . transcription of the hlya gene was higher than icda in all strains . relatively low hlya transcription rates  were found with poor hemolysin producing strains 536- <dig> and 695/ <dig>  strains carrying "group 1" α-hly plasmids  as well as peo <dig> showed significantly  lower transcription rates  compared to "group 2" and "group 3" strains with is elements inserted upstream hlyc . significant differences in hlya transcription rates were found between individual strains carrying "group 2" and "group 3" plasmids but they could not be clearly assigned to one of two groups. except for peo <dig> and peo <dig>  all "group 2" and "group 3" strains showed hlya transcription rates that were not significantly different from those of strains  <dig> and j <dig>  the latter carry each two chromosomally inherited α-hly genes  <cit> .

discussion
we have recently determined the nucleotide sequence of the peo <dig> α-hly genes, which are commonly occurring in epec o <dig> strains from humans and animals  <cit> . surprisingly, the α-hly genes were  <dig> % similar to that of phly <dig> which originates from a murine e. coli strain. moreover, plasmid encoded α-hly genes from phly <dig> and peo <dig> showed close similarity in the regulatory region upstream of hlyc and thus differed from chromosomally inherited α-hly determinants  <cit> . these findings may indicate that plasmid encoded α-hemolysins have evolved from one source and separately from the chromosomal hemolysin operons. in order to explore this possibility we compared plasmid α-hly from unrelated e. coli strains of human, mouse, canine and porcine origin for similarities the regulatory and structural genes and their adjacent sequences.

plasmid encoded α-hly determinants were found similar to each other in their genes  as well as in the adjacent sequences upstream and downstream of the α-hly-operon. plasmid encoded hlyc and hlya genes showed typical alterations in the nucleotide and in the amino acid sequence compared to their chromosomally encoded homologues. moreover, chromosomally encoded α-hly genes were found different for the regions encompassing the α-hly-operon. the finding that chromosomal hlyc and hlya genes clustered separately and showed greater sequence diversity compared to the plasmid homologues suggests that plasmid α-hly-genes have emerged more recently in e. coli and thus accumulated fewer changes compared to the chromosomal α-hly genes.

it was previously suggested that α-hly genes were acquired by strains of e. coli by horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the location of chromosomally encoded hemolysin genes on pathogenicity islands  <cit>  and the flanking of plasmid encoded α-hly genes by transposable elements  <cit> . a truncated is <dig> element located downstream of the hlyd gene was found in all α-hly plasmids investigated in our study indicating that the plasmid encoded α-hly determinants may have descended from a common progenitor  <cit> . we do not know much about the genetic similarity between the α-hly plasmids investigated in this study, except that they show differences in size  and conjugation ability. further investigation of plasmid backbone sequences could reveal if they have descended from a common progenitor. at present, we cannot exclude that the α-hly determinant was transposed independently to different plasmids in e. coli.

interestingly, plasmid peo <dig> differed largely from all other α-hly-plasmids investigated in this study. the nucleotide sequence analysis of its α-hly genes and the adjacent sequences revealed close similarity to chromosomal α-hly genes. because the α-hly genes present on plasmid peo <dig> shows all features of chromosomal α-hly operon it is likely that it was generated by recombination between a plasmid and chromosomal α-hly loci in e. coli. a similar event might have been involved in generation of a truncated α-hly segment in plasmid vir <dig> that has been analyzed for its complete nucleotide sequence .

the chromosomally located α-hly genes of the e. cloacae strain kk6- <dig> showed similarities to e. coli plasmid encoded α-hly determinants. the nucleotide sequence analysis of the  <dig> bp upstream region of the α-hly operon of kk6- <dig> was identical to that of the α-hly plasmid pann <dig>   <cit>  and the "phly152" region found in all α-hly plasmids except peo <dig> is present in kk6- <dig>  since α-hly is not common in strains of enterobacter species  <cit> , it seems likely that strain kk6- <dig> acquired the α-hly genes by conjugation from e. coli. similar findings have been made for plasmids encoding antimicrobial resistance  <cit> . however, we have not investigated this possibility.

interestingly, the hlyc and hlya sequences of the kk6- <dig> showed characteristic features which made it difficult to assign its α-hly determinant to the group of plasmid- or chromosomally inherited α-hly genes . it is possible that characteristic alterations found in the kk6- <dig> α-hly sequence are due to e. cloacae as a different bacterial host species.

multiple copies of is <dig> and is <dig> were frequently found in genetically unrelated strains of e. coli. is <dig> and is <dig> were found to be non-randomly scattered in the genomes of wild-type e. coli strains  <cit> . is-elements are involved in chromosomal rearrangements, integration of f-plasmids and transposition of genes  <cit>  and thus could have been involved in the generation of e. coli α-hly plasmids. activation of downstream genes by presence of is <dig> and is <dig> elements in e. coli has been reported  <cit>  and this could explain the relatively high hlya transcription rates in plasmids carrying is <dig> or is <dig> and is <dig>  however, we have not tested this possibility experimentally and other factors such as plasmid copy numbers and differences between the e. coli host strains could have an influence on the transcription rates.

α-hemolysin plasmids are frequently found in stec strains producing stx2e, agents of edema disease in pigs  <cit> , and in etec strains producing heat-stable enterotoxin causing diarrhea in dogs  <cit> . the α-hly plasmid peo <dig> is closely associated with epec o <dig> strains as diarrheal agents of human infants and calves  <cit> . in contrast, e. coli strains carrying chromosomal α-hly are associated with upec which are characterized by other virulence attributes and serotypes than etec, epec and stec strains  <cit> . the association of α-hly plasmids with intestinal and of chromosomal α-hly determinants with extraintestinal strains points to a separate evolution in these two major groups of pathogenic e. coli.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the α-hly genes present on plasmids in etec, stec and epec strains have a common origin. the presence of is-sequences flanking the plasmid α-hly genes suggest that these were introduced in e. coli by horizontal gene transfer. plasmids were shown to play a role in the spread of α-hly determinant to enterobacter cloacae. chromosomally α-hly genes present in upec are genetically more diverse and seem to have evolved separately from the plasmid α-hly genes.
