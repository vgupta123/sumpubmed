BACKGROUND
the rrm is one of the most common rna-binding domains  <cit>  and is found in proteins that participate in all steps of gene expression and rna processing  <cit> . the rrm is approximately  <dig> amino acids and forms a general single-stranded rna binding scaffold comprised of a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet flanked by two α-helices  <cit> . rrms bind rnas of different sequences and in many different structural contexts. in general, rrms make limited contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone compared to other rna-binding proteins and large cooperative networks of hydrogen bonds are formed with the nucleobases. although individual structures of rrm-rna complexes have been solved  <cit> , it remains unclear how this domain forms a general rna binding scaffold, while individual proteins containing rrms achieve high specificity for particular rna sequences.

extensive biophysical and biochemical investigations have made u1a a paradigm of rrm-rna recognition  <cit> . u1a is a component of the u <dig> snrnp and also regulates polyadenylation of u1a pre-mrna  <cit> . the n-terminal rrm of u1a binds with high affinity to stem loop  <dig>  in u <dig> snrna and an internal loop target site of nearly identical sequence in the u1a pre-mrna  <cit> . the structure of the n-terminal rrm of u1a bound to sl <dig> rna is shown in figure  <dig> <cit> . u1a contacts the auugcac sequence of the loop and the closing cg base pair. most hydrogen bond donors and acceptors of these bases are involved in hydrogen bonds with protein main chain or side chain functional groups in loop  <dig>  loop  <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  and loop  <dig> of u1a. in addition, conserved aromatic amino acid side chains in β <dig> and β <dig> stack with rna bases c <dig> and a <dig>  cooperative networks of interactions important for complex formation involving amino acids in loops  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and β <dig>  β <dig>  and β <dig> have been identified experimentally and have been suggested computationally  <cit> .

we are using the u1a-rna complex as a model system to understand how rrms are modulated for specific recognition of rna target sites  <cit> . the u1a protein is highly specific for the auugcac loop sequence. the auugcac sequence was selected for binding to u1a with 87–100% conservation at each site in a variety of loop sizes or in a linear sequence  <cit> . the u1a protein is particularly sensitive to base substitutions for the purines in the rna target site. mutation of a <dig> to g resulted in a large destabilization of the complex of  <dig>  kcal/mol   <cit> . mutation of the purines g <dig> or a <dig> to a or g, respectively, resulted in a  <dig> – <dig> -fold increase in the kd of the complex and a  <dig> – <dig>  kcal/mol destabilization of the complex   <cit> . mutations of pyrimidines in the target sequence were less destabilizing,  <dig> – <dig> kcal/mol  <cit> .

we have focused on investigating the specificity of u1a for the purines a <dig>  g <dig>  and a <dig> in the target sl <dig> rna, because u1a is finely tuned to recognize the correct purine bases at these positions. the data we report here suggest that for a <dig>  discrimination against non-cognate rna is a significant contributor to specificity in the absence of substantial direct contacts between u1a and the base. in contrast, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors on g <dig> are essential contributors to binding and cannot be substituted with aliphatic groups. recognition of a <dig> involves both positive contributions to binding by a <dig> hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and the destabilization of complexes with incorrectly placed functional groups. thus, the relative contributions to specificity of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors on cognate and non-cognate rna bases vary for recognition of a <dig>  g <dig>  and a <dig> in sl <dig> rna by the u1a protein.

RESULTS
strategy for probing specificity
to investigate the specificity requirements of the u1a protein, we have measured the affinity of the u1a protein for sl <dig> rna target sites containing modified purine bases. in one series of modifications, individual hydrogen bond donors or acceptors were eliminated or substituted with aliphatic groups to probe the energetic contributions of these functional groups to binding. in a second series of modifications, the purines were substituted with alternative hydrogen bond donors or acceptors to investigate the ability of the u1a protein to discriminate against incorrectly placed functional groups. it should be noted that these experiments do not identify the molecular origins of changes in binding affinity observed when altering a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor in the complex. the effects of these base modifications on binding are likely to be complex because they may alter the complex interface, change the structure and dynamics of both the free rna and the complex, alter cooperative networks of interactions involved in binding, or change solvation effects. the experiments reported here probe the importance of selected functional groups to the specificity of binding, and this importance may arise by altering any or all of these contributions to binding affinity.

recognition of a1
a <dig> stacks between u <dig> and the cg base pair that closes the loop in the u1a-sl <dig> rna complex   <cit> . a <dig> forms only one hydrogen bond with the u1a protein, which is between n <dig> and the side chain of arg <dig>  the side chain of arg <dig> also forms hydrogen bonds with the g that forms the closing gc base pair of sl <dig> rna. substitution of arg <dig> with gln abolishes binding  <cit> . the kd's of complexes formed with sl <dig> rnas containing modifications at the a <dig> position are reported in table  <dig>  representative gel mobility shift analyses and binding curves are shown in figure  <dig>  despite the small number of hydrogen bonds between a <dig> and the u1a protein, the substitution of g for a <dig> resulted in a  <dig> kcal/mol destabilization of the complex. this is similar to the destabilization of the complex observed previously for the substitution of a <dig> with c  <cit> . the substitution of g for a <dig> may introduce a base pair between g and c <dig> on the 3'-end of the loop, thus reducing the loop to  <dig> nucleotides. this additional base pair would be expected to destabilize the complex because complex formation would require dissociation of the additional base pair. however, the double mutant a1g c10a sl <dig> rna, which cannot form an analogous additional base pair, bound with similar affinity  × 10- <dig> m) as a1g sl <dig> rna to u1a. the c10a substitution alone had little effect on binding affinity  × 10- <dig> m). thus, these experiments suggest that specific recognition of a <dig> does not require an extensive hydrogen bond network with the base.

to probe the role of base functional groups without introducing new functional groups a <dig> was substituted with purine, in which the 6-nh <dig> group is replaced with hydrogen, and with c1a in which n <dig> is replaced with c-h. both substitutions resulted in very small destabilizations of the complex  even though a hydrogen bond is formed between n <dig> and the side chain of arg <dig> in the x-ray structure. in contrast, base substitutions that altered the pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, such as a1i, or added hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, such as a1dap or a1-2ap, resulted in a much larger destabilization of the complex of  <dig> – <dig>  kcal/mol. within the wild type structure the 2ap and dap substitutions would introduce unfavorable steric interactions between the side chain of leu <dig> and the 2-nh <dig> group, while the substitution of inosine for a <dig> would introduce an electrostatic repulsion between n1-h and the side chain of arg <dig>  these unfavorable interactions may contribute to the destabilization of the complexes containing a1-2ap and a1-dap, which could contribute to alternate structures being formed in these complexes. these data suggest that the poor affinity of a1g sl <dig> rna for u1a is due to the altered pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors on g compared to a, rather than a loss of specific hydrogen bonding interactions. thus, at this position, specificity is a consequence primarily of the destabilization of complexes containing non-cognate bases.

recognition of g4
g <dig> is packed between u <dig> and a number of amino acids in the u1a protein   <cit> . g <dig> forms the largest number of hydrogen bonds with the u1a protein of any base in the auugcac sequence. hydrogen bonds are formed between n <dig> and the amide side chain of asn <dig>  o <dig> and the main chain amide of asn <dig>  o <dig> and the main chain carbonyl of leu <dig> , 2-nh <dig> and o <dig> of u <dig>  2-nh <dig> and the side chain of glu <dig>  and n1-h and the side chain of glu <dig>  substitution of a for g <dig> resulted in a  <dig>  kcal/mol loss of binding affinity. this value is comparable to that reported previously  <cit> .

the binding affinities of u1a for sl <dig> rnas containing a series of base analogs substituted for g <dig> are reported in table  <dig>  representative gel mobility shift analyses and binding curves are shown in figure  <dig>  the elimination of 2-nh <dig>  or the substitution of n <dig> with c-h  resulted in destabilizations of the complex of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kcal/mol, respectively. the greater loss in binding free energy upon substitution of g <dig> with c7g than with i suggests that n <dig> is a more important contributor to binding than is the 2-nh <dig> group even though two hydrogen bonds are observed between the 2-nh <dig> group and the u1a protein in the x-ray structure, compared to one hydrogen bond between n <dig> and the u1a protein. \these results are consistent with previously performed protein substitutions. the substitution of asn <dig>  which forms a hydrogen bond between the amide side chain and n <dig> of g <dig>  with val abolished binding  <cit> . in contrast, the substitution of glu <dig>  which forms a hydrogen bond between the side chain and 2-nh <dig>  with ser destabilized the complex, but did not abolish binding  <cit> .

the substitution of either 2ap or dap for g <dig> results in a larger destabilization of the complex,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kcal/mol, respectively, than was observed for either the g4i or g4c7g substitutions, perhaps because these substitutions alter functionality at both the  <dig> and  <dig> positions of the purine ring. because of the weak binding affinity of u1a for these rna sequences full binding curves were not obtained leading to more uncertainty in the reported dissociation constants compared to those for other rna sequences. however, the large destabilization of the complex with the g4-2ap substitution suggests that the 6-o or n1-h groups are essential for binding to u1a. in the structure of the wild type complex g4dap and g4-2ap substitutions would introduce an electrostatic repulsion between the lone pair of n <dig> and the side chain of glu <dig>  however, based on the low binding affinity of u1a for sl <dig> rna containing these substitutions, it is likely that the structure of these complexes are altered from the wild type structure. the significant destabilization of the complex observed upon substitution of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors on g <dig> with aliphatic groups and the substitution of g <dig> with 2ap suggest that the specificity of the u1a protein for g <dig> is dependent in large part on direct and indirect contributions of the g <dig> functional groups to complex stability.

recognition of a6
the interactions between a <dig> and u1a in the x-ray cocrystal structure are shown in figure 2d <cit> . a <dig> stacks between phe <dig> and c <dig>  the substitution of non-aromatic amino acids for phe <dig> results in a large destabilization of the complex  <cit> . n <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of ser <dig>  the 6-nh <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of thr <dig>  and n <dig> forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the main chain amide of thr <dig>  we previously showed that the substitution of a with any other base results in a large destabilization of the complex of  <dig> – <dig>  kcal/mol, while the elimination of individual hydrogen bond donors or acceptors resulted in a  <dig> – <dig>  kcal/mol destabilization of the complex  <cit> . the substitution of ser <dig> with ala resulted in a similar destabilization of the complex as resulted from the substitution of n <dig> of a <dig> with a c-h group  <cit> . in addition, we observed energetic coupling between phe <dig> and hydrogen bond donors and acceptors on a <dig>  <cit> . thus, the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors on a <dig> play direct and indirect roles in stabilizing the complex.

the exchange of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors  or the addition of a hydrogen bond donor  resulted in a much larger destabilization of the complex than the elimination of individual hydrogen bond donors and acceptors . within the context of the wild type structure, the introduction of the 2-nh <dig> would introduce unfavorable steric interactions with the side chain of leu <dig>  an amino acid previously suggested to be important for specific recognition of sl <dig> rna  <cit> , and the substitution of inosine for a <dig> would result in unfavorable steric interactions between n1-h and the side chain of ser <dig> and an unfavorable electrostatic interaction between o <dig> and the main chain carbonyl of asp <dig>  these unfavorable interactions may destabilize the complex, which could contribute to alternative complex structures being formed upon incorporation of these modified bases. together, the results from the experiments eliminating hydrogen bond donors and acceptors from a <dig> reported previously  <cit>  and those exchanging hydrogen bond donor and acceptors reported here suggest that specific recognition of a <dig> involves both direct recognition of the base and discrimination against incorrectly placed functional groups.

rna stability
the large destabilizations of the complexes formed with u1a upon incorporation of many of the base analogs described here suggests considerable variation in free rna or complex structure as a result of these base substitutions. the rna loop is dynamic when free, making it difficult to characterize the effect of the base substitutions for a <dig>  g <dig>  and a <dig> on rna structure. because the base analogs contain modified hydrogen bond donor and acceptor patterns that are similar in polarity and stacking ability to g and a, it is likely that the primary effect of the base analogs is to alter the structure of the complex. however, we were concerned that the a1g sl <dig> rna and perhaps the a1i sl <dig> rna could form an additional base pair, thus stabilizing sl <dig> rna and reducing the size of the loop.

to investigate the effect of base substitutions on sl <dig> rna stability, temperature dependent melting analyses were performed. the tm's of the sl <dig> rnas not previously reported are listed in table  <dig>  a limitation of this method is that it primarily probes the structure and stability of the helical portion of sl <dig> rna, rather than the loop. thus, not surprisingly, the tm's of sl <dig> rnas containing base substitutions were similar to or within error of that of the wild type rna. the measured tm's varied between 57°c and 62°c, with no correlation observed between the tm and the binding affinities reported in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  as expected, the tm of the a1g sl <dig> rna  was 2°c higher than the range observed for the other rna's, including a1i sl <dig> rna . the tm of the sl <dig> rna containing a1g/c10a, which eliminates the possibility of an additional gc base pair, was measured to be within the range of the other sl <dig> rnas . because the stabilities of the complexes containing a1g and a1g/c10a sl <dig> rnas are within experimental error and the c10a substitution does not itself alter the stability of the complex, the additional stability of the a1g sl <dig> rna does not appear to be a large contributor to the destabilization of the complex by this substitution.

discussion
the substitution of the three essential purines in sl <dig> rna with bases in which hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are replaced with aliphatic groups and with bases in which hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are placed incorrectly on the base has enabled us to compare the positive contributions of correct functional groups with the negative contributions of incorrectly placed functional groups to the binding specificity of the u1a protein. these comparisons have suggested that specific recognition of essential purines by the u1a protein varies from primarily discrimination against non-cognate bases for a <dig> to direct contributions of the base functional groups for g <dig>  the base modifications introduced in these experiments are likely to not only eliminate and introduce individual interactions that either destabilize or stabilize the complex, but to affect other interactions in the complex that are energetically coupled with the modified base. cooperative networks of interactions involving both protein and rna residues have been identified experimentally and suggested computationally in the u1a system  <cit> . these studies have focused more on cooperative networks in the free and bound proteins than on networks involving rna. however, experiments have suggested energetic coupling between a <dig> and phe <dig> and between loop  <dig> of u1a, tyr <dig>  gln <dig> and the rna  <cit> , and an analysis of collective atomic fluctuations in md simulations of the u1a-sl <dig> rna complex suggest large networks of interactions involving both protein and rna that have not yet been explored experimentally  <cit> . thus, the energetic roles of individual hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that we have identified to be important for the discrimination by u1a between cognate and non-cognate rna sequences are likely to be complex.

previously, shamoo and coworkers investigated the recognition of purines by two linked rrms from hnrnpa, called up <dig>  <cit> . up <dig> is a significantly different rrm than u1a and a comparison of u1a and up <dig> should be valuable for developing principles of rrm-rna specificity. shamoo and coworkers suggested three generalizations of rna recognition by rrms based on experiments with up <dig>  first, interactions with main chain amides might provide greater base discrimination than interactions with side chains. although this idea has not yet been fully evaluated in the u1a-rna complex, binding studies that have been performed with rnas containing modified bases have suggested that interactions with main chain amides are not necessarily more important than those with side chains in the u1a-rna complex. for example, n <dig> of g <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of asn <dig>  as reported in table  <dig>  substitution of n <dig> with c-h results in a significant destabilization of the complex. in contrast, the substitution of a <dig> with purine, which eliminates the 6-nh <dig> group that forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of thr <dig> destabilizes the complex comparably as the substitution of n <dig>  which forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of ser <dig>  with c-h  <cit> . second, hydrogen bonds to bases involving charged amino acids are more energetically important than those involving neutral amino acid functional groups. u1a does not have a large number of hydrogen bonds with charged residues, so these are not required for tight binding. third, steric repulsion is a key discriminatory tool for gaining sequence specificity. in fact, for the u1a-rna complex, steric and electrostatic repulsion due to incorrectly placed functional groups can be more important than direct base recognition in controlling specificity. thus, specific recognition of rna target sites by up <dig> and u1a are similarly guided by discrimination against non-cognate rna.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, these investigations show three different approaches used by the u1a protein to specifically recognize essential purines in the sl <dig> rna target site and underscore the ability of steric and electrostatic repulsion to be important for specificity even in the absence of a direct hydrogen bond network with the base. the contributions of negative recognition to specificity have been shown to be important in rna recognition by other proteins, for example by the ms <dig> coat protein and trna synthetases, and also in dna-protein recognition  <cit> . thus, the data from the u1a-sl <dig> rna and up1-rna complexes extend this generalization to the rrm-rna complexes. together, these results form part of a growing body of data that shows the importance of steric and electrostatic discrimination against incorrectly placed functional groups on non-cognate bases in governing the specificity of rna-protein complexes. these general principles describing the origins of specificity of protein-rna complexes will be invaluable in understanding and controlling complex formation.
