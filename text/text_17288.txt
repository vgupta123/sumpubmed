BACKGROUND
three conserved dna polymerase enzymes whose activities are essential for complete chromosomal dna replication have been identified through biochemical studies in mammalian systems  <cit>  and combined genetic and biochemical studies in yeast  <cit> . during s-phase, the dna polymerase α-primase complex synthesises the short rna-dna segment that is used to prime synthesis of the leading strand at the chromosomal replication origin and synthesis of each okazaki fragment on the lagging strand. the short rna segment is synthesised by the primase and then extended by 10– <dig> nucleotides by pol α. the 3' end of the rna-dna primer is recognised by replication factor c , which displaces the pol α-primase complex and catalyses the loading of the sliding clamp pcna at the primer-template junction. pcna then acts as a processivity factor for the pol δ and/or pol ε enzymes. the exact roles played by pol δ and pol ε remain unclear  but pol δ is most likely responsible for lagging strand replication and may also play a role on the leading strand. yeast lacking pol ε catalytic activity are viable but are slow growing and somewhat impaired in chromosome replication  <cit> . in such cells, pol δ is thought to perform the bulk of nascent dna chain elongation, raising the possibility that this enzyme performs a similar function in wild-type cells. if this is the case, pol ε could have a specialised role, at replication origins for example, or in the replication of sites of sister chromosome cohesion  <cit> .

each of the three essential polymerases is a multi-subunit entity, comprising a large catalytic subunit and a number of smaller subunits that are presumed to play either regulatory or structural roles  <cit> . little is known of the biochemical functions of the smaller subunits but in yeast most are, like the three catalytic subunits, essential proteins. in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, the pol α-primase and pol δ complexes are both heterotetrameric in structure  <cit> . the catalytic subunits of the two complexes, pol <dig> and pol <dig> respectively, are members of the b family of dna polymerases typified by bacteriophage t <dig> polymerase or pfu  <cit> . both complexes also contain related b-subunits. these proteins are members of a larger family of phosphotransferase and nuclease enzymes  <cit> , although no enzymatic activity has been detected for either of the dna polymerase subunits. in fission yeast, the b-subunit of pol δ is the cdc <dig> protein. fission yeast pol δ also contains two further subunits: the c-subunit cdc <dig>  which functions in part to link the polymerase to pcna  <cit> , and the d-subunit cdm <dig>  of the four pol δ subunits, only cdm <dig> is non-essential  <cit> . orthologues of all four of these proteins  make up mammalian pol δ  <cit> .

perhaps surprisingly, there have been few reports of physical interactions between the various polymerase enzymes believed to be present at the eukaryotic replication fork. one exception to this comes from large-scale functional analysis of the budding yeast proteome where an interaction was uncovered between the catalytic subunit of the pol α-primase complex, pol <dig>  and the c-subunit of the pol δ complex in budding yeast, pol <dig>  <cit> . interaction between these proteins was detected using the two-hybrid system, raising the possibility that the interaction was not a direct one, but was instead mediated via a third protein factor or complex. recently, the two-hybrid result was independently confirmed and a direct interaction between the budding yeast pol α-primase and pol δ demonstrated by mixing of the purified enzyme complexes followed by co-immunoprecipitation  <cit> . by this method, pol α-primase and pol δ were shown interact in a pol32-dependent manner  <cit> . a form of pol δ containing a mutant pol <dig> protein lacking a  <dig> amino acid region of the c-terminal domain  was also shown to be unable to co-immunoprecipitate with pol α-primase  <cit> , providing the first indication of the location of the pol α binding site on pol <dig> 

in this paper, it is shown that the orthologues of the budding yeast pol <dig> and pol <dig> proteins in fission yeast, pol <dig> and cdc <dig> respectively, also interact in the two-hybrid system. it is also shown that these proteins are capable of interacting directly with one another, in vitro, using purified recombinant proteins and peptides. interaction is also seen between the human cdc <dig> and pol <dig> homologues, p <dig> and p <dig>  the binding site for pol <dig> maps to the extended c-terminal domain of the cdc <dig> protein and requires the presence of a short protein sequence motif, which we have designated the dpim, for dna polymerase interaction motif. this short sequence is conserved in cdc <dig> orthologues from a wide variety of eukaryotic species. despite this evolutionary conservation, mutational inactivation of the pol <dig> binding motif does not affect cdc <dig> function in vivo. the implications of these results are discussed.

RESULTS
interaction between fission yeast pol <dig> and cdc27
to test for interaction between fission yeast pol <dig> and cdc <dig>  the two-hybrid system was used. full-length cdc <dig> fused to the activation domain  of the yeast gal <dig> protein was tested for its ability to interact with amino acids 278– <dig> of fission yeast pol <dig> fused to the dna binding domain of the bacterial transcription factor lexa . amino acids 278– <dig> correspond to the smallest region of budding yeast pol <dig> shown to interact with pol <dig>  <cit> . reporter gene induction, measured by β-galactosidase activity assay, was observed in the presence of the gal <dig> ad-cdc <dig> and lexa-pol1-278- <dig>  proteins, but not when either protein alone was present . thus, as in budding yeast, the catalytic subunit of pol α is able to interact with the c-subunit of pol δ.

mapping the pol <dig> binding site on cdc27
previously, minimal cdc <dig> and pcna binding regions on cdc <dig> have been mapped  <cit> . cdc <dig> binds within the globular  <dig> amino acid n-terminal domain of the  <dig> amino acid cdc <dig> protein, whereas pcna binds at the extreme c-terminus of cdc <dig> at a conserved p21cip1-like pcna binding sequence, the pip box. to map the pol <dig> binding site, a series of thirteen truncated cdc <dig> proteins fused to the gal <dig> ad were tested against lexa-pol <dig> in the two-hybrid system. the results of this analysis are shown in figure  <dig>  pol <dig> binds within the extended c-terminal domain of cdc <dig>  with the smallest construct capable of binding spanning a forty amino acid region, from amino acids 293– <dig>  therefore, the pol <dig> binding region is distinct from both the globular n-terminal domain and c-terminal pip box. in support of this, two-hybrid analysis showed that cdc <dig> could bind to both pol <dig> and pcn <dig>  proteins simultaneously: gal <dig> ad-pcn <dig> and lexa-pol <dig> fusion proteins  could be brought together by co-expression of cdc <dig> .

cdc27-pol <dig> interactions with recombinant proteins
in order to test whether the interaction between pol <dig> and cdc <dig> was a direct one, purified recombinant cdc <dig> and pol <dig> proteins were assayed for their ability to interact in vitro. purified gst-cdc27-273- <dig> fusion protein  <cit>  was tested for its ability to pull-down purified recombinant hexahistidine-tagged pol <dig> . the results  mirror those seen with the two-hybrid assays and provide the first evidence that the interaction between the cdc <dig> and pol <dig> proteins is a direct one, rather than being mediated via a third protein or set of proteins, such as one of the other subunits of the pol α-primase or pol δ complexes.

pol <dig> binding site sequence
previously, cdc <dig> homologues from fission yeast  <cit> , budding yeast  <cit> , human, mouse  <cit> , and xenopus  <cit>  have been identified and characterised. to extend this family, blast  <cit>  and ψ-blast searches  <cit>  were performed to identify putative cdc <dig> family members from other eukaryotic species. in all,  <dig> protein sequences were identified, from organisms as diverse as vertebrates, worms, fungi and plants. protein sequence alignments  of the c-terminal regions of these proteins identified a set of highly conserved amino acids that form a putative dna polymerase interaction motif  with the consensus sequence d-g -- . the sequences flanking the dpim are generally highly charged in character and some sequence conservation  is apparent in these regions. mutagenesis and peptide binding studies  suggest that, in addition to the dpim, some of these sequences may also play a role in binding pol <dig> .

interaction between human pol <dig> and cdc <dig> orthologues
to examine whether the pol1-cdc <dig>  interaction observed in the yeasts was also conserved in higher eukaryotes, the catalytic subunit of human pol α and the human cdc <dig> orthologue p66/kia <dig> were assayed for interaction using the two-hybrid system. amino acids 291– <dig> of the human pol α catalytic subunit, corresponding to the minimum cdc <dig> binding region  in fission yeast pol <dig>  were expressed as a lexa fusion alongside gal <dig> activation domain fusions of either the entire c-terminal domain of human p <dig>  or the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids only . interactions were tested by β-galactosidase assay. both p <dig> constructs bound to pol α , indicating that the dna polymerase interaction is a conserved feature. in addition, it was observed that human p <dig> was able to interact with fission yeast pol <dig> , suggesting that conserved sequences  within the cdc27/p <dig> c-terminal region, such as the dpim, were important for the interaction.

mutational analysis of pol <dig> binding site on cdc27
next, the importance for pol <dig> binding of the conserved amino acids in the dpim was examined. eight mutant cdc <dig> proteins  were expressed as gal4-cdc27-273- <dig> fusion proteins and tested for their ability to bind to lexa-pol <dig>  in the two-hybrid system. in each mutant protein one or more conserved amino acids is replaced with alanine. for example, the cdc27-p <dig> mutant sees the conserved triplet dee  substituted with aaa. the results of this analysis are shown in figure  <dig>  mutating the conserved amino acids of the dpim  completely abolished pol <dig> binding in vivo by cdc <dig>  similar reductions were seen with the cdc27-p <dig> and cdc27-p <dig> mutants, where the mutated residues are located n-terminal and c-terminal to the dpim respectively. the conserved amino acids of the dpim are therefore essential for pol <dig> binding by cdc <dig>  although sequences flanking the conserved motif also play a role. only three of the eight mutant proteins  were able to interact with lexa-pol <dig> , though the strength of the interaction was reduced to 30–40% of the wild-type value for cdc27-p <dig> and cdc27-p <dig> , and to ~ 10% of wild-type for cdc27-p <dig> . immunoblotting showed that all the mutant proteins were present in yeast protein extracts at the same level as the wild-type gal4-cdc <dig> fusion protein .

the observation that sequences flanking the dpim play a role in pol <dig> binding was supported by the results of studies performed with a nested set of overlapping  <dig> mer peptides derived from the s. pombe cdc <dig> sequence . the peptides were tested for their ability to bind to an epitope-tagged form of the pol <dig> protein  in fission yeast protein extracts. as can be seen in figure 5b, pol1-13myc is precipitated by peptides spb, spc and spd, but not spa and spe. peptide spc spans the groups of basic amino acids n-terminal to the conserved motif, including those shown to be required for pol <dig> binding as defined by the cdc27-p <dig> and -p <dig> mutants above, but does not include the conserved sequence deegflvt indicating that, in this in vitro situation, the conserved amino acids are not absolutely required for pol <dig> binding, in contrast to what is observed in vivo. similar results were observed with peptides derived for the human p <dig> protein sequence , again illustrating the potential for cross-species interaction between human p <dig> and fission yeast pol <dig> .

mapping the cdc <dig> binding site on pol1
in an effort to map more precisely where within the pol <dig> protein cdc <dig> binds, several truncated forms of pol <dig>  were constructed and tested as lexa fusions in the two-hybrid system . removal of fifty amino acids from the n-terminus, or twenty amino acids from the c-terminus, of the pol <dig>  protein was found to abolish the interaction with cdc <dig> altogether .

previously, the isolation of a temperature-sensitive mutant pol <dig> allele, pol1-ts <dig>  had been reported  <cit> . sequence analysis revealed that this allele differed from the wild-type pol1+ by deletion of  <dig> bp from the orf, resulting in loss of three amino acids  from within the minimal cdc <dig> binding domain defined above. in this study, the ability of a pol1-ts <dig> bait to bind to cdc <dig> was tested using the two-hybrid system. no interaction could be detected at a range of growth temperatures , indicating that amino acids 470– <dig> are required for cdc <dig> binding by pol <dig>  to test whether overproduction of cdc <dig> might rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of pol1-ts <dig>  these cells were transformed with plasmid prep3x-cdc <dig>  <cit>  and transformants plated at restrictive and semi-restrictive temperatures on thiamine-free medium, to induce high-level expression of cdc27+ from the thiamine-repressible nmt promoter. no suppression of the pol1-ts <dig> phenotype was observed, however . indeed, no suppression was observed of any of three pol <dig> alleles that were analysed in this way, the others being pol1- <dig>  <cit>  and pol1-h <dig>  <cit> .

expression of dpim mutants in vivo
to assay the in vivo role of the dpim in cdc <dig>  four of the eight dpim mutant alleles  were cloned into plasmid prep3x, 3' to the repressible nmt <dig> promoter  <cit> , and transformed into a cdc27+/cdc27::his7+ diploid strain. transformant colonies were then induced to sporulate and the spores plated on media containing thiamine, to repress the nmt <dig> promoter. under these conditions, residual low level expression from the nmt <dig> promoter ensures that the level of cdc <dig> protein present in the cell is comparable to that seen in wild-type cells  <cit> . analysis of the meiotic products showed that the mutant cdc <dig> proteins were able to support growth of cdc27Δ haploid cells; indeed, no phenotypic defects were apparent .

to confirm this, a fission yeast strain was constructed in which the endogenous cdc27+ gene was precisely replaced with the cdc27-q <dig> mutant allele. in the cdc27-q <dig> mutant protein, the central five amino acids of the dpim are replaced with alanine, resulting in loss of cdc27-pol <dig> interaction in the two-hybrid system . construction of the cdc27-q <dig> strain was achieved by first replacing one copy of cdc27+ with ura4+ in a diploid strain, before then replacing the cdc27::ura4+ allele with cdc27-q <dig> via 5-foa counterselection in the cdc27::ura4+ haploid carrying cdc27-q <dig> on a plasmid . pcr analysis of genomic dna using primers specific for wild-type cdc27+ and cdc27-q <dig> sequences  allowed the identification of haploid strains in which cdc27-q <dig> was correctly integrated at the endogenous cdc27+ locus, and also allowed the cdc27-q <dig> mutant to be conveniently followed through genetic crosses.

phenotypic analysis of cdc27-q <dig> cells, in comparison to an otherwise isogenic cdc27+ control, revealed the following: cells carrying the cdc27-q <dig> allele grew normally at a range of temperatures , with a generation time indistinguishable from wild-type . at 32°c, cdc27-q <dig> cells underwent division at ~  <dig>  μm . further analysis showed that the cdc27-q <dig> cells were indistinguishable from wild-type in all respects examined, including responses to the dna replication inhibitor hydroxyurea  and the dna damaging agents methylmethane sulphonate , camptothecin , bleomycin sulphate  and uv light . the kinetics of cell division arrest in response to hu were also examined, but again no difference was detectable between cdc27-q <dig> and wild-type strains . that cell number increase is arrested in cdc27-q <dig> cultures following treatment with hu, and that both wild-type and cdc27-q <dig> cells become highly elongated under these conditions, is indicative of the presence of a functional dna replication checkpoint in these cells. taken together, these results strongly suggest that the pol1-cdc <dig> interaction does not play an essential role either during s-phase or in various dna repair pathways in fission yeast.

the consequences of introducing additional mutations into the cdc27-q <dig> background were also investigated. cdc27-q <dig> was crossed to strains carrying mutations in the other three subunits of pol δ  and in the helicase-endonuclease dna <dig> and its associated protein cdc <dig> .  <cit> . the double mutant strains were then analysed as described in materials and methods. in every case examined, the properties of the double mutant with cdc27-q <dig> were indistinguishable from the single mutant. the cdc27-q <dig> mutation was also combined with rad3Δ  <cit>  and cds1Δ  <cit>  alleles, to create cdc27-q <dig> rad3Δ and cdc27-q <dig> cds1Δ double mutants, both of which were viable. the rad <dig> and cds <dig> proteins are key components of various dna structure checkpoints in fission yeast  <cit> . that the cdc27-q <dig> double mutants were viable indicates that cdc27-q <dig> cells do not require the presence of a functional checkpoint for viability. when wild-type cells are treated with hydroxyurea, activation of cds <dig> results in cell cycle arrest and replication fork stabilisation. in the absence of cds <dig>  however, replication forks are believed to collapse, resulting in loss of viability  <cit> . the rad3Δ and cds1Δ double mutants were tested for their sensitivity to hu and cpt, but as before, no differences were observed between single and double mutants with cdc27-q <dig> .

discussion
in fission yeast, dna polymerase δ is a multisubunit complex comprising a large catalytic subunit that is required for chromosomal replication as well as three smaller subunits, two of which are also essential for cell viability  <cit> . understanding how the four subunits of the complex interact with one another, and how they interact with other components of the replication machinery, is an important goal. once interactions are identified and the sites of interaction precisely mapped, reverse genetic analysis allows determination of the effects of disrupting individual protein-protein interactions on replisome function.

in this paper we show that the c-subunit of fission yeast pol δ, cdc <dig>  is able to interact both in vivo and in vitro with pol <dig>  the catalytic subunit of pol α. the pol <dig> binding site on cdc <dig> has been mapped by in vivo and in vitro approaches and a region of  <dig> amino acids, from amino acids  <dig> –  <dig>  has been shown to be sufficient for binding. protein sequence alignments of cdc <dig> homologues across this  <dig> amino acid region identify a short protein sequence motif  that is highly conserved and which is essential for pol <dig> binding. this dna polymerase interaction motif  is flanked by relatively highly charged sequences. ten basic amino acids are found flanking the dpim in the fission yeast cdc <dig> protein sequence, nine of which are located n-terminal to the central conserved motif. similarly, there are ten acidic amino acids, all of which lie either within the conserved dpim or c-terminal to it. our mutagenesis data clearly implicates several of these charged groups in the binding to pol <dig> . secondary structure predictions suggest that the conserved dpim is likely to form a turn or loop, raising the possibility that the sequences on either side of the conserved motif interact with one another. the distribution of positively and negatively charged amino acids in most, though not all, of the cdc <dig> homologues in other species  is similar to that in fission yeast. the most obvious exception to this is in the c. albicans cdc <dig> protein, where six acidic amino acids are found n-terminal, and seven basic amino acids c-terminal, to the dpim. this organisation of charged residues appears again to be compatible with the notion the sequences on either side of the dpim may interact with one another.

the cdc <dig> protein has an elongated shape, with a frictional ratio of  <dig>   <cit> . the same is true of its budding yeast orthologue pol <dig> which has a frictional ratio of  <dig>   <cit> . the elongated shape of cdc <dig> is due to the c-terminal region of the protein. the n-terminal cdc <dig> binding domain, comprising amino acids 1– <dig>  <cit> , behaves in solution as a globular protein  <cit> . the protein-protein interaction motif described in this study is the second to be mapped to the extended c-terminal domain. previously we showed that cdc <dig> interacts with pcna via a conserved sequence at the extreme c-terminus of the protein  <cit> . our results indicated that this interaction was essential for cell viability. consistent with this, cdc27-pcna contact is vital for maximal polymerase processivity in vitro. however, recently we obtained evidence that the cdc27-pcna interaction is a non-essential one .

recently, the results of a deletion analysis of pol <dig>  the budding yeast orthologue of cdc <dig>  were reported  <cit> , including analysis of pol32-pol <dig> interaction. the results of these studies showed that amino acids 270– <dig> of pol <dig> were required for pol <dig> binding in the two-hybrid system. this region corresponds to amino acids 286– <dig> in fission yeast cdc <dig> and includes the conserved dpim sequence . deletion of amino acids 250– <dig>  greatly reduced pol <dig> binding, consistent with the results reported here with the cdc27-p <dig>  -p <dig> and -p <dig> mutants , as did deleting amino acids 310– <dig> , consistent with the cdc27-p <dig> mutant result.  in addition, it was shown that that pol α-primase and pol δ could be co-immunoprecipitated following mixing of the purified complexes, but that this interaction was effectively abolished when pol δ contained the 270– <dig> deletion of pol <dig> rather than the full-length protein  <cit> .

in this paper, cells expressing the dpim mutant protein cdc27-q <dig> were shown to be no more sensitive then wild-type to hu, mms, cpt, uv and bms , while analysis of budding yeast cells expressing pol <dig> lacking the dpim  showed them to be no more sensitive than wild-type to hu and uv, and to show normal rates of mutagenesis following uv exposure  <cit> . indeed, in all situations examined, s. pombe cdc27-q <dig> cells were indistinguishable from wild-type. no genetic interactions were observed between cdc27-q <dig> and various other dna replication or checkpoint mutants, including the key checkpoint kinase rad <dig> 

in conclusion, while the interaction between pol α-primase and pol δ mediated via cdc <dig> could play an important role in coordinating the events of lagging strand synthesis, we have yet to obtain any evidence that this is the case. this raises two possibilities. first, that the observed interaction does not play an important role in chromosomal replication. we believe that this is unlikely to be the case, given the high degree of conservation of the dpim sequence across evolution, in a region of the cdc <dig> protein that is very poorly conserved at the primary sequence level. the second possibility is that there are multiple redundant interactions within the lagging strand machinery. in this case, an important role for the cdc27-pol <dig> interaction might only be uncovered when another protein-protein interaction is perturbed, in which case, the cdc27-q <dig> mutation might be expected to be synthetically lethal or sick with a mutant that disrupted the overlapping redundant function. with the genetic tools available in yeast, this is a hypothesis that is readily testable.

CONCLUSIONS
in fission yeast, interaction between pol α and pol δ is mediated, at least in part, by direct binding of the pol δ c-subunit cdc <dig> to the pol α catalytic subunit pol <dig>  and requires the presence of a short sequence motif  in the c-terminal region of cdc <dig>  the dpim is conserved in all known cdc <dig> orthologues. despite this, it has not been possible to identify any phenotypic consequences associated with deletion of the dpim sequence, raising the possibility that the observed interaction does not play a crucial role in vivo.
