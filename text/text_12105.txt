BACKGROUND
high molecular weight glutenin subunits  are important storage proteins in seed endosperms of wheat and its related species  <cit> . due to their composition effects on the elasticity of wheat dough, hmw-gss play a significant role in the determination of grain processing quality  <cit> . hmw-gss are encoded by the genes at glu- <dig> loci on the long arms of the group  <dig> chromosomes  in bread wheat. hmw-gss can be further classified into two subfamilies , which are thought to have arisen from gene duplication events. single copy of x-type and y-type gene occurs at two tightly linked loci, glu-1x and glu-1y. the hmw-gss encoded by glu-1x or glu-1y can be distinguished from each other by the difference in their peptide lengths  <cit> . previous studies indicated that allelic polymorphism in wheat hmw-gss is associated with variations in the gluten viscoelasticity and bread making quality  <cit> . up to now, a number of glu- <dig> alleles and hmw-gss have been identified and characterized from wheat and its related species  <cit> . sequence analyses of hmw-gs coding regions revealed that the primary structure of mature hmw-gss consists of a central repetitive domain flanked by the conserved n-terminal and c-terminal regions  <cit> . the repetitive domain is mainly composed of repeat motifs including tripeptide, hexapeptide and nonapeptide. the difference among various hmw-gss is mainly resulted from variable number of repeat motifs in the repetitive domains  <cit> .

the section sitopsis of genus aegilops contains five species: aegilops bicornis,  jaub. & spach. , ae. longissima  Á. löve. , ae. sharonensis  Á. löve. , ae. searsii,  Á. löve.  and ae. speltoides,  Á.löve,   <cit> . previous reports on cytogenetic and genetic investigations indicated that aegilops genomes from this section of five species are closely related  <cit> . although the characterization of hmw-gss in two accessions of ae. searsii have been reported  <cit> , the glu- <dig> alleles and hmw-gss in other four sitopsis species have not been investigated. our preliminary study surveyed the expression of hmw-gss in ae. bicornisae. longissima and ae. sharonensis and realized that the sitopsis glu- <dig> alleles encodes the glutenin subunits with molecular weights much larger than other known hmw-gss available in public databases. here, we report the isolation and characterization of novel glu- <dig> alleles and hmw-gss from ae. bicornisae. longissima and ae. sharonensis. the objective of this study is to investigate the structural features of sitopsis hmw-gss, understand the evolutionary relationship of hwm-gs gene family within triticeae, and further explore the potentials of s genome-encoded hmw-gss in wheat quality breeding.

RESULTS
identification of aegilops hmw-gss and glu- <dig> alleles
the sds-page profiles on three accessions of ae. bicornisae. longissima and ae. sharonensis indicated that sitopsis hmw-gss consist of large x-type and y-type subunits which migrate significantly slower than the same type of subunits in chinese spring . subsequent cloning of the glu- <dig> orfs further verified that the molecular weights of these sitopsis x-type subunits are close to or larger than that of 1dx <dig> , one of largest hmw-gss previously reported  <cit> . the results of n-terminal sequencing suggested that the protein bands with slower and faster mobility are x- and y-type subunits, respectively. the obtained sequences of seed protein are perfectly matched to those deduced from the cloned genes .

the consensus sequences of x-type and y-type hmw subunits of bread wheat were also list as standard. the results indicated that the amino acid sequences translated from the cloned genes are perfectly matched to those of the native protein of seeds.

the pcr amplicons of sitopsis glu- <dig> alleles are composed of two dna fragments  for each of three accessions . all amplified pcr products were cloned and the glu- <dig> orfs at different alleles were determined by the sequence analysis and enzyme digestions. the full length of glu- <dig> orfs was obtained by using the method of primer walking and nested deletion. six sequences for x-type and y-type hmw-gss from the s genome of three aegilops species were designated as 1sbx <dig>  and 1sby <dig>  , 1slx <dig>  and 1sly <dig>  , 1sshx <dig>  and 1sshy <dig>  , respectively. all these dna sequences have been deposited into the ncbi database with the genbank accession numbers from jn <dig> to jn <dig> 

expression of 1sshx <dig>  and 1sshy <dig>  in bacterial cells
after removing the coding sequence for the signal peptide from the orfs of 1sshx <dig>  and 1sshy <dig> , the modified orfs were cloned into pet- <dig>  two bacterial expression constructs  were chosen to express mature protein in bacterial cells. in the cells harboring pet-1sshx <dig>  and pet-1sshy <dig> , iptg induction led to the expression of the protein bands with electrophoretic mobility similar to those of the native x and y-type subunits from the seed extract of ae. sharonensis .

structural characteristics of primary sequences of aegilops hmw-gss
we predicted the amino acid sequences of six sitopsis hmw-gss and found that their primary structures are composed of four regions, i.e. a signal peptide, a central repetitive domain, the conserved n-terminal and c-terminal. the distribution and number of cysteine residues are identical to those in typical x-type and y-type subunits . the deduced protein sequences were firstly aligned with other known hmw-gss from a, b and d genomes. such comparison demonstrated that there is a higher similarity between s and d genome. therefore, we realigned the hmw-gss identified from three sitopsis accessions in this study with those encoded by d genome available in public databases to determine their evolutionary relationship . our results indicated that the s genome-encoded glutenin subunits considerably differ from other known hmw-gss. compared to 1dx <dig>  sitopsis x-type subunits  share the insertion of  <dig> residue with five tripeptides,  <dig> hexapeptides and four nonapeptides . for sitopsis y-type subunits, both 1sly <dig>  and 1sshy <dig>  have an insertion of  <dig> residues with seven hexapeptides and seven nonapeptides , but this duplicated block in 1sby <dig>  only contains five hexapeptides and five nonapeptides . we found that the peptide insertions in both x-type and y-type subunits from three sitopsis species are copied from the adjacent regions, with some variations in single or more amino acid residues.

the numbers of amino acid residues in bold are for large subunits.

structural characteristics of 5’ flanking promoters of aegilops hmw-gss
the 5’ flanking promoter regions of hmw-gs genes in three sitopsis species were amplified by using two pairs of pcr primers specific to x-type and y-type subunits, respectively. all amplified pcr products were cloned and sequenced. based on previous studies, the promoter regulatory elements of hmw-gss are composed of tata box, complete and partial hmw enhancers, e and n motifs  <cit> . our results indicated that the amplified promoter regions of sitopsis hmw-gss cover all recognized promoter regulatory elements. the dna lengths of 1sbx <dig> , 1slx <dig>  and 1sshx <dig>  promoter are identical ; whereas those of 1sby <dig> sly <dig>  and 1sshy <dig>  varied from 845 bp to 919 bp. the characterized promoter sequences of sitopsis x-type and y-type hmw-gss were aligned to homologous regions of 1ax2*, 1bx <dig>  1dx2triticum urartu 1ay1by <dig> and 1dy <dig>  respectively. multiple sequence alignments showed that both types of glutenin subunits encode the conserved domains and variable parts in their promoter regions. we found that the hmw-gs promoters mainly differentiate with base substitutions, insertions, or deletions . all the regulatory elements in the characterized sitopsis hmw-gs promoters share the high conservation with few substitutions . an 85 bp fragment, in which the partial hmw enhancer was included, was deleted in the 5’ flanking promoter regions of 1sshy <dig>  . this deletion has not interrupted the expression of 1sshy <dig> .

the position of each variation is underlined in the corresponding locus of consensus sequences.

phylogenetic relationship of hmw-gss between s and other genomes
to investigate the evolutionary relationship between s genome-encoded hmw-gs alleles and those of a, b, d genomes, we constructed the phylogeny of a network and a neighbor-joining tree . the 5’ flanking promoter sequences, plus the sequences encoding signal peptides and the n-terminal, were selected for phylogenetic analysis because they have demonstrated to be phylogenetically informative. firstly, our previous study on hmw-gs promoter indicated that the regulatory elements which control the tissue specificity and expression level of different hmw-gs genes are well conserved in diploid species of triticeae  <cit> . secondly, the sequences encoding signal peptides and n-terminal domain are also relative conserved. therefore, these hmw-gs sequences were suitable for phylogenetic analysis  <cit> .

our network analysis demonstrated that all hmw-gs alleles are clustered into two groups  . both x-type and y-type subunits showed a star-like phylogeny from principle nodes. in the x-type group, 1slx <dig>  and 1sshx <dig>  are linked to 1sbx <dig> , and then form a close link to the principle node which is composed of 1dx <dig>  1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> *. for the y-type group, 1sby <dig> , 1sly <dig>  and 1sshy <dig>  are formed a parallel link to the y-type genes encoded by d genome. the resulted nj tree also indicated that x-type and y-type subunits are divided into two clades which support a close phylogenetic relationship on hmw-gss between s and d genome . therefore, our results from both network and neighbor-joining tree demonstrated that s genome-encoded hmw-gs alleles are evolutionally related to those of d genome.

discussion
as hmw-gss play the key role in determining wheat gluten and dough elasticity, the characterization on novel hmw-gss from triticeae wild germplasm will be beneficial not only for improving wheat end-use quality but also for further understanding the structure variation and evolution of this important protein family. compared to bread wheat, wild triticeae grasses have more hmw-gs variants. for example, a number of hmw-gs variants with novel structural characteristics have been identified from aegilops genus  <cit> . however, the progress on characterizing the hmw-gs expression from aegilops section sitopsis species remains slow and our knowledge on their structure, function, and evolution is still limited. in this study, we report the isolation and characterization of six x-type and y-type hmw-gss variants from the s genome of three aegilops species . these novel variants will be useful to widen or enrich glu- <dig> genes and hmw-gss for wheat quality breeding.

structural variations and evolution of glu-s <dig> alleles and possible mechanism
to avoid the potential error in pcr or sequencing, each nucleotide sequence was determined by multiple independent clones. the results of n-terminal sequencing indicated that the first  <dig> residues of n-terminal protein sequence of all  <dig> x and y-types subunits deduced from dna sequences match perfectly to those directly determined by protein sequencing. and further bacterial expression proved that the cloned sequences are indeed accurate representations of the coding genes of hmw-gs in three aegilops species. therefore, the molecular information for glus <dig> alleles obtained in this study is reliable and suitable for exploring structural differentiation and evolution of glu-s <dig> alleles. our results demonstrated that each of three aegilops section sitopsis species has two expressed subunits and the possession of large molecular weights is unique in both x-type and y-type subunit of s genomes . previous study reported that 1dx <dig> * and 1dx <dig>  are the largest hmw-gss and their mature subunits contain  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues, respectively  <cit> . in this study, we identified that the length of ae. sharonensis subunit 1sshx <dig>  is  <dig> residues, shorter than 1dx <dig> * but longer than 1dx <dig> , which means 1sshx <dig>  is the second largest hmw-gss characterized so far . in addition, 1sbx <dig>  of ae. bicornis and 1slx <dig>  of ae. longissima also have large molecular weights close to that of 1dx <dig> . for y-type hmw-gs genes, the lengths of their complete orfs are usually less than 2 kb. our previous study reported that a hmw-gs gene variant 1ay , isolated from einkorn wheat, encodes its orf with the length of 2202 bp, larger than all other known y-type genes  <cit> . in this study, however, we identified two novel y-type glu- <dig> alleles, 1sly <dig>  from ae. longissima and 1sshy <dig>  from ae. sharonensis, and determined that their orf lengths are  <dig> and 2242 bp, respectively, much larger than that of 1ay  . as the y-type hmw-gs genes with such large molecular weights have not been reported in wheat and its related species, both 1sly <dig>  and 1sshy <dig>  will be special and useful to extend our knowledge on structure, function, evolution of the y-type hmw-gss.

four modes have been proposed for the sequence alteration and evolution of hmw-gss:  single residue changes,  deletion or insertion in a repeat unit,  single repeat changes, and  deletions or duplications of repeat blocks  <cit> . it has been reported that the unequal crossover events and slip-mismatching are the most likely mechanism of the size variations in hmw-gss  <cit> . in this study, we found that the large molecular weights of s genome-encoded subunits are almost entirely due to the insertion and duplication of these repeat motifs . previous study on comparative analysis of peptide sequences indicated that 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> * are evolved from the two separate duplications of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, respectively  <cit> . although three s genome-encoded x-type subunits, 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> * have been resulted from duplication events, they are different in three ways. firstly, each duplication of 1sx subunits, 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> * occur at different positions of repetitive domains . secondly, the duplicated regions contain the varied numbers of repeat motifs which result in distinct size of inserted fragments among 1sx subunits, 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> *. thirdly, the inserted fragments from duplications in 1sx subunits are not completely identical to that from which it was duplicated . on the contrary, the new inserted regions in 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> * are perfect copy of adjacent region without any changes. based on above discussions, we can conclude that sitopsis x-type subunits, 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> * may have independent origins, although they share the similar evolutionary mode. we realized that such similar pattern also exists in the s genome-encoded y-type subunits.

implications of novel aegilops hmw-gss for wheat quality breeding
two structural features of hmw-gss may be relevant to their participation as gluten polymers in the baking quality of dough. firstly, the number and distribution of cysteine residues determine the forming inter- and intra-molecular disulphide bonds. it is well known that disulphide bonds play a key role in determining the structure and properties of wheat glutenin polymers. the presence of an additional cysteine residue in the repetitive region of subunit 1dx <dig> was reported to be responsible for the correlation of this particular hmw-gs with good bread-making quality  <cit> . we found that the s genome-encoded subunits have the conserved cysteine composition, which may be important to keep the normal gluten polymer. secondly, the properties and interactions of repetitive domains are important in determining the dough viscoelastic properties  <cit> . the positive relationship between the hmw-gs sizes and their effects on dough strength has been revealed by previous studies. belton  <cit>  and feeney et al.  <cit>  proposed a model in which the gluten polymers interact via inter-chain hydrogen bonds between the subunit repetitive domains and more stable interactions can be formed with longer subunits. the experiments of incorporating the 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> *subunits into dough indicated that both subunits can lead to yield the dough strength greater than 1dx <dig>  as both x-type and y-type subunits encoded by the s genome are larger than almost all other known hmw-gss, we predict that the s genome-encoded hmw-gss may have an outstanding ability to strengthen the gluten interactions. based on our results, it will be valuable to further explore the potential values of these novel sitopsis hmw-gs variants in modifying the structure, composition and function of wheat storage proteins. furthermore, these special s genome-encoded genes and glutenin subunits will be helpful to overcome the bottleneck of poor genetic diversity of glu- <dig> alleles and hmw-gss in hexaploid wheat. two approaches are under the way to verify the function of 1sx subunits. one is to develop wheat transgenic plants which allow the endosperm specific expression of 1sx alleles; the other is to transfer the 1sx subunits to tetraploid or hexaploid wheats by the interspecies cross.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and characterized six novel hmw-gs variants from three aegilops section sitopsis species. the possession of large molecular weights is unique feature of s genome-encoded hmw-gss. these sitopsis glutenin subunits with large molecular weights have been resulted from the similar duplication of repetitive domains as those in the subunits 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> *. the s genome-encoded subunits, 1dx <dig>  and 1dx <dig> * have independent origins, although they share similar evolutionary mechanism. because of their molecular weights much larger than all other known hmw-gss, these novel sitopsis glutenin subunits can be used as special genetic resources to improve wheat quality breeding.
