BACKGROUND
evolutionary novelty may brought by different processes, their different weights having been debated in the last years  <cit> . these processes include changes in protein sequence, regulatory changes and duplication  <cit> , or combinations of all these factors  <cit> . the present study illustrates a possible new example of a combination of duplication, modulation of gene expression and changes in evolutionary rates, which may be of relevance to adaptation in a group of insects.

small non-coding rnas have been shown to play a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression. these ~20- <dig> nucleotides long molecules have been described  and classified depending on their endogenous or exogenous origin, their mechanisms of biogenesis and function and their biological role. regulation of gene expression by small non-coding rnas is always carried out in association with a protein of the argonaute family and is executed at multiple levels, ranging from chromatin modification to post-transcriptional control  <cit> .

micrornas  are small non-coding rnas of ~20- <dig> nucleotides which derive from the transcription of endogenous genes by rna pol ii. in animals, they are first produced as long stem-loop hairpin primary mirna precursors  which are cleaved in the nucleus by the rnase iii enzyme drosha with the help of the double stranded rna binding protein pasha   <cit> . the resulting pre-mirnas are then translocated to the cytoplasm by exportin- <dig>  where they are subsequently cleaved by a second rnase iii enzyme called dicer in association with the double stranded rna binding protein loquacious , yielding the mature mirna in the form of an rna duplex. commonly, one of the strands of the duplex is degraded while the other is loaded into an effector complex named risc  which has a protein of the argonaute family as key component. the mirna guides the risc to a target messenger rna  by recognition of a complementary or nearly complementary sequence usually located in the 3’utr of the target mrna. microrna-mrna recognition leads to the degradation or the inhibition of the translation of the targeted mrna  <cit> .

several instances of duplications have been reported for the machinery of small non-coding rnas, in particular for the mirna pathway in animals. some of these duplications have been also linked to the neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization of one or both duplicate pairs. for example, only one dicer is present in vertebrates and in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, which cleaves both mirnas and small interfering rnas , but two copies of this protein have been described in drosophila melanogaster and other insects: dicer- <dig>  involved in the mirna pathway, and dicer- <dig>  associated with the production of sirnas  <cit> . expansions of the argonaute family have been more common, the most impressive example being the  <dig> members found in c. elegans <cit> . the duplications in this nematode have involved subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization of the copies, with only two of the  <dig> copies associated with mirnas. other expansions of this family have also been observed in insects like the mosquitoes culex pipiens and aedes aegypti <cit> , or in the crustacean daphnia pulex, with  <dig> copies described  <cit> . in d. melanogaster five argonaute proteins exist, of which ago- <dig>  and ago- <dig>  are related to the risc. on the contrary, all of the  <dig> argonaute proteins described in vertebrates are able to load mirnas  <cit> .

the sequencing of the genome of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum <cit>  allowed the identification of homologues of the small non-coding rnas machinery for the first time in a hemimetabolous insect. their preliminary characterization revealed an unusual expansion of the machinery specific to pirnas  <cit>  and mirnas, with the existence of four copies of pasha , two copies of dicer- <dig> , and two copies of argonaute- <dig>   <cit> . this is the first such general expansion of the mirna machinery observed for a coelomate animal. in all other insects studied to date, only one copy of each of these genes specific to the mirna pathway exists. preliminary molecular evolutionary analyses suggested that the duplications of ago- <dig> and dcr- <dig> in aphids occurred roughly simultaneously, and that for each gene one of the duplicated copies was characterized by a higher evolutionary rate and relaxation of selection , while the other was conserved and subject to strong purifying selection . furthermore, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous rates  was well above  <dig> for ago-1b, which suggested the existence of positive selection driving the evolution of this gene, possibly towards a new function  <cit> . however, most of these preliminary analyses included only one aphid species, a. pisum, which might have given very rough estimates of the dates of duplication events and of the selective pressures acting on the different copies.

to further evaluate the biological implications of the expansion of the mirna machinery in aphids, we have carried out an evolutionary and expression analysis of dcr- <dig> and ago- <dig> duplicated genes. for this, the two copies of dcr- <dig> and ago- <dig> were sequenced in several aphid species representing a gradient of evolutionary distance from a. pisum in order to better evaluate the phylogenetic timing of the duplications as well as the evolutionary pattern of nucleotide evolution and selective pressures affecting these genes.

the existence of different copies of the mirna machinery raises the question of whether these duplicates could be recruited differently along the complex biological life-cycle of aphids, and if the different copies could play a role in the modulation of gene expression along this cycle. aphids typically alternate between several generations of parthenogenetic females, which take place during spring and summer, and one annual generation of sexual reproduction at the end of summer, which produces overwintering eggs. they display a remarkable degree of polyphenism, with several morphs resulting from a same genotype during the parthenogenetic phase of their life cycle . as a first attempt to evaluate the functional implication of the mirna machinery duplications, semi-quantitative rt-pcrs were carried out in the different reproductive morphs of the pea aphid and revealed different levels of gene expression in parthenogenetic and sexual aphids, suggesting a role for ago-1b and dcr-1b regulation in the sexual polyphenism of a. pisum. we discuss the data in the perspective that the duplication of ago- <dig> and dcr- <dig> might be related to the neofunctionalization of one of the copies of each of these genes.

RESULTS
phylogenetic distribution of the duplications of the mirna machinery in aphids
we have investigated the duplication of dcr- <dig> and ago- <dig> in several aphid species from the subfamily aphidinae. two copies of ago- <dig> were found in all of these species, belonging to two tribes, aphidini and macrosiphini . however, some regions of ago-1b could not be obtained in some species, due to unsuccessful pcr amplifications.

aembl accession numbers are given for each copy and region of ago- <dig> and for each copy of dcr- <dig>  two numbers are given for those species where two alleles were obtained. a blank in a cell means that the sequence for that gene/region in that particular species was not obtained. baphid species were classified following remaudière and remaudière . cthe gene was named dcr-1a in the acyrthosiphon species, where a dcr-1b sequence was found, and dcr- <dig> in the rest of species, where a second copy was not found. dsequence from an aphis gossypii cdna library . esequences for which the complete targeted region could not be obtained.

the separation of ago-1a and ago-1b copies was clear when amino acid sequences were used for the phylogenetic inference, for the three regions of the gene as well as for the concatenated alignment, and independently of the method used , while with nucleotide sequences the groups differed depending on the phylogenetic method. all amino acid sequences of ago-1a in the aphidini+macrosiphini were identical except for one amino acid substitution in region  <dig> in a. svalbardicum. by contrast, ago-1b copies were much more variable, as revealed by long branches for all species.

the sequencing of dcr- <dig> yielded two different copies only in the three species of the genus acyrthosiphon. despite the use of up to  <dig> combinations of pcr primers, no partial dcr-1b sequence was obtained in the other species. the name of the gene was kept as dcr- <dig> for those species where only one copy was sequenced, while the two copies found in the acyrthosiphon species were named dcr-1a or dcr-1b. identical trees were obtained with different methods and whether analyzing nucleotide or amino acid data. by contrast with results obtained for ago- <dig>  the oldest nodes in the maximum likelihood tree obtained for dcr- <dig> were not supported by high bootstrap values, thus preventing an unambiguous determination of the phylogenetic timing of the duplication of this gene in aphids. we conducted sh and elw  <cit>  tests to compare among seven different phylogenetic hypotheses concerning the time of duplication of dcr- <dig>  the seven hypotheses were constructed by independent permutation of each of the three oldest nodes in the dcr- <dig> ml tree . the ml tree was named as hypothesis  <dig>  the seven hypotheses can be seen in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  hypotheses  <dig> and  <dig> placed either r. padi dcr- <dig> or a. gossypii dcr- <dig> sequences in a basal position, leaving the other one as sister of the rest of aphid sequences. hypotheses  <dig> and  <dig> included r. padi and a. gossypii dcr- <dig> sequences in the dcr-1/1a group or the dcr-1b group, respectively. hypotheses  <dig> and  <dig> altered the phylogenetic position of m. persicae dcr- <dig> sequences, either placing them as sister to the rest of macrosiphini or included in the dcr-1b group.

none of the seven hypotheses were rejected by the sh test, while the elw test only rejected hypotheses  <dig> and  <dig> . the hypothesis  <dig>  suggests one gene duplication of dcr- <dig> that would have happened in the ancestor of the tribe macrosiphini, after the split between aphidini and macrosiphini; in addition, the dcr1-b copy would have been lost secondarily in m. persicae or just could not be amplified in that species. the hypotheses  <dig> and  <dig>  imply a complex scenario for the evolution of this gene, involving several duplications during the evolution of the subfamily aphidinae. both hypotheses  <dig> and  <dig> would also involve that one of the copies would have been lost in the macrosiphini or simply not amplified in the pcr experiments. the hypotheses  <dig> and  <dig>  imply a simpler scenario that would imply that the duplication of dcr- <dig> would have preceded the split between aphidini and macrosiphini, and that the sequences obtained for r. padi and a. gossypii would belong either to the dcr-1a  or the dcr-1b  copies –but this again implies a loss of or failure to amplify the other copy in several species. finally, the hypotheses  <dig> and  <dig>  which involve a change in the branching of the m. persicae dcr- <dig> sequences, were rejected by the elw test, which gives strong support to the belonging of these sequences to the dcr-1/1a group. taken together, these results do not allow making a clear statement about the phylogenetic timing of the duplication of dcr- <dig> in aphids, although scenarios of a duplication after the split between aphidini and macrosiphini are more parsimonious.

the complete set of topologies can be found in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  δ: difference in -lnl from best topology as calculated by tree-puzzle. c: confidence value . a * denotes topologies significantly out of the confidence set in the elw test and topologies significantly worse than the ml tree in the sh test.

analyses of evolutionary pressures on sequences
the best fit branch model for each region of ago- <dig> and for dcr- <dig> was the two-ratio model, with one ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous rates  for the fast evolving copies  and a different ratio for the slow evolving copies  copies . this result is in agreement with the difference in branch lengths observed in the phylogenetic reconstructions . however, selective pressures on each of the copies varied among regions and genes. regions  <dig> and  <dig> of ago- <dig> showed the minimal value of ω= <dig>  for ago-1a copies, due to lack of non-synonymous substitutions, so reflecting strong purifying selection acting on this copy. on the contrary, we found values of ω= <dig>  for region  <dig> and ω= <dig>  for region  <dig> for the ago-1b copies, suggesting highly relaxed selection. these two regions analyzed for ago- <dig> encode an n-terminal domain of unknown function , a paz domain and the n-terminal portion of the piwi domain of the protein . the c-terminal portion of the piwi domain is encoded in region  <dig>  where a similar pattern was found, but with a low value of ω= <dig>  for ago-1a, and a not so relaxed ω= <dig>  for the ago-1b copies. the difference between the slow- and fast-evolving copies of dcr- <dig> was less pronounced, with ω= <dig>  for dcr-1/1a and ω= <dig>  for dcr-1b.

for branch models, the best overall model is highlighted  with its corresponding ω values. for site and branch-site models, the best model is highlighted as well as the number of positively selected sites when relevant. maof: model ma with omega fixed to 1; maoe: model ma with omega estimated. see text for further explanations about the models.

consistent with this pattern, site models and branch-site models in which a class of positively selected codon positions is allowed  were significantly better than neutral models  for regions  <dig> and  <dig> of ago- <dig>  but not for region  <dig> of ago- <dig> nor for dcr- <dig>  bayesian empirical bayes estimates in model m <dig> showed  <dig> and  <dig> codon positions with a probability p> <dig>  of ω being higher than  <dig> for regions  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the estimates from the branch-site model ma showed  <dig> and  <dig> codon positions with p> <dig>  of ω> <dig> for the same regions. for both models the positively selected sites detected for regions  <dig> and  <dig> did not aggregate in any particular domain.

gene conversion
geneconv was used to search fragments in the alignments of dcr- <dig> and ago- <dig> that were unusually similar between pairs of sequences, a possible result from gene conversion. some pairwise fragments were detected for two regions of ago- <dig> and for dcr- <dig> but always concerned two sequences of the same gene duplicate . on the contrary, no global fragments were significant for any of the three regions of ago- <dig> or for dcr- <dig>  thus showing no evidence for gene conversion occurring between the -1a and -1b copies of each of these genes.

further duplication and pseudogenization of dcr- <dig> in the genus acyrthosiphon
the sequencing of dcr-1a and dcr-1b in the species a. kondoi and a. svalbardicum revealed a third copy of this gene, which was called dcr-1c. furthermore, a deeper search on the a. pisum lsr <dig> genome led us to find also a third copy of dcr- <dig> in this species, although partial and fragmented into two different positions of the currently available scaffolds of the genome . besides, the region of dcr- <dig> analyzed in this study was not found in this third copy of a. pisum. the inclusion of these sequences in different phylogenetic trees showed that they correspond most likely to two independent further duplications of dcr-1b , one for a. pisum and another one for a. kondoi and a. svalbardicum. on the other hand, several features of these sequences, like the presence of frameshifts, stop codons and mutations in splice sites, strongly suggest that they have undergone a process of pseudogenization.

alternative transcription of dcr- <dig> in aphids
the cloning of cdna sequences from a. pisum, a. gossypii and r. padi revealed the existence of alternative transcription in dcr-1/1a . two alternative transcripts were found for each of these three species, differing by a pattern of intron retention: in each species, intron  <dig> was retained in one of the transcripts but spliced in the other. in a. pisum, this intron is  <dig> nucleotides long, thus yielding a  <dig> amino acids longer protein, but in a. gossypii and r. padi this intron is  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides long respectively, thus a not multiple of three. in these two latter species, intron retention introduces a frameshift and the appearance of premature stop codons. intron  <dig> of apidcr- <dig> is located in the region of the gene that encodes the second set of functional sites of the rnase iiia domain of the protein. the translation of the transcript retaining intron  <dig> in a. pisum would yield a separation of  <dig> aa between the active/metal binding sites and the polypeptide binding sites of these set. in a. gossypii and r. padi, this retention would entail the loss of these polypeptide binding sites and of the whole rnase iiib domain of dcr- <dig> .

expression profiles in the reproductive morphs
aphids typically alternate between several generations of parthenogenetic reproduction and one annual generation of sexual reproduction taking place at the end of summer in response to shortening of photoperiod  <cit> . transcripts levels of dcr-1a, dcr-1b, ago-1a and ago-1b genes were measured by semi-quantitative rt-pcr in different reproductive morphs of the life cycle of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum: adult parthenogenetic virginoparae females , adult parthenogenetic sexuparae females , sexual oviparae females , and males. the two ago- <dig> gene copies and dcr-1a were expressed in all morphs . for dcr-1a, expression levels showed no statistically significant differences among morphs. by contrast, ago-1a, ago-1b and dcr-1b showed significant differences of expression according to the reproductive morph: ago-1a, was over-expressed in sexuparae and under-expressed in oviparae, and ago-1b was under-expressed in virginoparae while dcr-1b was over-expressed in sexuparae and not detected in males. these results suggest that the duplication of ago- <dig> and dcr- <dig> in the pea aphid is associated with specialization of transcription according to the reproductive morph.

discussion
the sequencing of the genome of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum indicated an unusual expansion of the small non coding rna machinery specific to mirnas  <cit> . the discovery of these gene duplications opens new perspectives of research about the regulation of gene expression by mirnas in aphids, which might play a crucial role in the striking polyphenism displayed by these insects. several scenarios may occur after gene duplications: non-functionalization, subfunctionalization and, more rarely, neofunctionalization  <cit> . given that the mirna machinery appears to be a fundamental mechanism in metazoa, with genes very conserved and as unique copies in most animal genomes known to date, it was particularly interesting to evaluate the different fates of these duplications. more precisely, we tried in this study to determine the age, evolutionary rates, and expression-specificities of the gene duplicates of dicer- <dig> and argonaute- <dig> described for a. pisum. the preliminary characterization of the expansion of the mirna machinery in the pea aphid pointed out a strong divergence of ago-1b in a. pisum, a feature that suggested a change in function for ago-1b protein in aphids  <cit> .

the sequencing of ago-1a and ago-1b in different aphid species in the present study has revealed the presence of both copies of this gene in all the species analyzed, including the two tribes of the aphid subfamily aphidinae: aphidini and macrosiphini. this result indicates that ago- <dig> was duplicated in an ancestor of this subfamily . by contrast, our analysis provided a different estimation of the timing of duplication of dcr- <dig>  we found a dcr-1b copy only in the three species of the genus acyrthosiphon, which suggests a more recent duplication event. however due to the moderate bootstrap support values, we cannot presently propose a solid conclusion on the timing of this duplication. however, scenarios of a more recent duplication than found for ago- <dig>  seem more parsimonious, as they imply less events of gene loss . future genome sequencing projects for different aphids species will give the opportunity of estimating whether the duplication of dcr- <dig> may have occurred earlier during aphid evolution.

aphid genomes seem to have been affected by recurrent gene duplications through their evolution, with the pea aphid genome showing the highest number of gene families among the insect genomes sequenced to date  <cit> . in a previous study, we found similar pairwise synonymous distances between duplicates of genes of the mirna machinery in the pea aphid, which suggested that the duplications of ago- <dig> and dcr- <dig> had occurred roughly simultaneously  <cit> . in contrast, in this study, with more phylogenetic evidence, we found that the duplication of ago- <dig> probably preceded that of dcr- <dig>  indeed, we have also found that dcr- <dig> has been further duplicated two independent times after the dcr-1a/b duplication in the genus acyrthosiphon, although these new copies have most likely become pseudogenes.

the analysis of the patterns of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions in the duplicates of ago- <dig> and dcr- <dig> in aphids has also provided, for each of the genes, a similar picture of a slow evolving copy subject to purifying selection  and a fast evolving copy characterized by relaxed selection . the difference among copies was much more pronounced for ago- <dig> than for dcr- <dig>  the evolution of ago-1a has clearly been driven by strong purifying selection, as detected by branch models in paml, with extremely low values of ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates  and near-absence of replacements for the aphids of the subfamily aphidinae. such strong purifying selection implies sequence stability for this protein over a period of approximately 50– <dig> millions of years, the estimated age of the split between aphidini and macrosiphini  <cit> . contrastingly, the ago-1b copies have been characterized by a strong acceleration of evolutionary rates, with different intensity in the three regions analyzed . branch models for the analysis of selective pressures estimate a dn/ds value that is averaged over the entire sequence analyzed. however, the gene sequence may contain both positions with very low or no variability due to purifying selection and positions in which change is promoted by positive selection. site-models allow the detection of positive selection acting on specific positions of the sequence that might be unseen by branch models. indeed, site and branch-site models led us to detect the signature of positive selection acting on regions  <dig> and  <dig> of ago-1b. branch-site models in particular showed that positive selection has played a role in the evolution of the ago-1b copies, with many codon positions with dn/ds ratios significantly higher than  <dig> .

the difference of rates between the two copies of dcr- <dig> was less pronounced than for the two copies of ago- <dig>  the branch model of best fit estimated that purifying selection has characterized the dcr-1a copy of the acyrthosiphon spp and the unique dcr- <dig> copy in species where the duplication was not found, , although the sequence was less conserved than the slow-evolving ago-1a. by contrast, the selective pressures on dcr-1b appeared to be more relaxed  and similar to the value found for region  <dig> in ago-1b. as for region  <dig> of ago-1b, no sign of positive selection was detected in dcr-1b.

we finally evaluated differences of expression of the duplicated copies among different reproductive morphs characteristic of the aphid life-cycle, which alternates sexual and asexual reproduction. the display of such polyphenism must involve a finely tuned mechanism of regulation of gene expression from their gene families-rich genomes, in which mirnas could play a key role, along with other phenomenon like alternative transcription. in this report, we have obtained a first insight on the functional characterization of the gene duplicates of ago- <dig> and dcr- <dig> by means of semiquantitative pcrs carried out on four morphs of the life cycle of the pea aphid. our results have shown a differential regulation of the expression of ago-1a, ago-1b and dcr-1b among the morphs. the most striking pattern is that of dcr-1b, which seems to be only expressed in the sexupara, the parthenogenetic female that gives birth to the sexual morphs. although no signature of positive selection could be detected for dcr-1b, the structure of its sequence gives an interesting clue supporting a possible change in function. the three species of acyrthosiphon where dcr-1b was sequenced share a deletion of  <dig> amino acids in the protein sequence with respect to dcr-1a, which is located inside the first rnase iii domain. this deletion does not affect any of the active sites, but has probably changed the distance between them inside the rnase iiia domain, as well as the distance between the rnase iiia and rnase iiib domains. interestingly, the two rnase iii domains in drosha and dicer seem to interact with each other to make an intramolecular dimer with the two catalytic sites located close to each other, and the distance between them seems to determine the length of the small rna produced after cleavage  <cit> . it is tempting to hypothesize that the deletion in dcr-1b, which has been evolutionarily conserved in the genus acyrthosiphon, may have determined a change in the distance between catalytic centers and consequently in its function, leading to the production of small non coding rnas of different length. all active sites in the two rnase iii domains of dcr- <dig> have remained conserved in the two copies of the protein found in aphids and also in the three outgroup species except for two changes. by contrast, the region of the rnase iiia domain that contains the deletion in dcr-1b is highly variable and shows other deletions in the outgroup species, which could affect the regulation of gene expression by small non coding rnas. consistent with this hypothesis, the alternative transcription described for dcr-1a in a. pisum would yield two translated dcr-1a proteins differing by the absence or presence of  <dig> aa located inside the second set of functional sites of the first rnase iii domain of the protein, which might also alter the length between the catalytic centers and allow the production of small non coding rnas of different length. the same alternative transcription observed in a. gossypii and r. padi entails the loss of the rnase iiib domain in one of the alternative transcripts, which probably leads to an non-functional protein, given that the interaction of both rnase iii domains seem to be needed for cleavage.

future experiments will allow to study whether the gene duplications of the mirna machinery play a primary role in the sexual/asexual polyphenism in aphids. it is important to note that cyclical parthenogenesis is an ancient and ubiquitous trait in these insects, and that most of its subfamilies display this same reproductive polyphenism with only one copy of dcr- <dig>  this means that the duplication of the mirna machinery genes was not essential for settling the sexual/asexual alternation of reproductive modes that define the aphid life-cycle. but the different copies might have evolved differently and specific roles at different steps of the life-cycle. the research on the implications of the mirna machinery in the aphid polyphenism will benefit not only from comparative genomics analysis that will allow knowing precisely the phylogenetic distribution of its gene duplications but also comparative functional studies between aphids having and not having the gene duplicates. the strong purifying selection acting on ago-1a and dcr-1a suggests that these proteins probably have retained their function in the mirna machinery. on the other side, both relaxed and positive selection acting on dcr-1b and ago-1b might have led these copies to evolve a new function. further studies will be needed to explore their potential new role in the mirna system and at the different steps of the reproductive cycle of these organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
the sequencing of the two gene duplicates of argonaute- <dig> and dicer- <dig> in several aphid species has allowed us to better estimate the phylogenetic timing and the evolutionary pressures that have affected the duplication of the mirna machinery in these insects. this study has revealed that the duplication of argonaute- <dig> occurred in the ancestor of the aphid subfamily aphidinae, while the duplication of dicer- <dig> seems to have occurred in the ancestor of the aphid tribe macrosiphini. a common pattern for both genes has been shown with one fast-evolving copy  and one slow-evolving copy . the acceleration of evolutionary rates in ago-1b and dcr-1b and the existence of positive selection acting on ago-1b suggests the possibility of a neofunctionalization for these copies which might have interesting implications on the regulation of gene expression by mirnas in aphids. besides, semi-quantitative pcrs have revealed a differential expression of ago-1b and dcr-1b among the different morphs of the parthenogenetic and sexual phases of the pea aphid life cycle, thus suggesting their implication in the striking polyphenism displayed by this group of insects.
