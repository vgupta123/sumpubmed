BACKGROUND
in protein synthesis the rules of the genetic code are established through catalytic aminoacylation of trnas by their cognate synthetases. with some notable exceptions, each aars enzyme acylates a specific amino acid to its cognate trna. throughout the three domains of life synthetases are partitioned into two structurally and evolutionary unrelated classes   <cit> . these differ in their secondary structure arrangements, in their conserved sequence motifs composing the active site, and in the side of the trna acceptor stem to which they dock  <cit> . lysrs is the only known exception to this classification, aminoacylating trna by two rather than by one enzyme: lysrs <dig> featuring the distinct structure and characteristics of a class  <dig> aars and lysrs <dig> with the distinct structure and characteristics of a class  <dig> aars  <cit> . structural studies of lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig> complexed with lysine indicated that in addition to the canonical aars class distinctions, the amino acid binding site of lysrs <dig> is more compact than that of lysrs <dig>  <cit> .

all known eukaryotae apparently code only for lysrs <dig>  most bacteria code for lysrs <dig>  but some taxa, predominantly within the class of alpha-proteobacteria, code for lysrs <dig>  archaea mostly code for lysrs <dig>  with some exceptions coding for lysrs <dig>  r.f. doolittle and j. handy  <cit>  predicted that prokaryotes will be found coding for both types of lysrs by the same organism. for a while this prediction was not accepted  <cit> . recently, it was confirmed: the genomes of several mesophilic prokaryotes were shown to encode both lysrs <dig>  and lysrs <dig> . already five such organisms have been identified: methanosarcina mazei  <cit> , methanosarcina acetivorans  <cit> , methanosarcina barkeri  <cit> , bacillus cereus  <cit>  and treponema palladium  <cit> .

with continuing increase of complete genome sequencing, there is no compelling reason to doubt that the number of prokaryotae discovered to code for both classes of lysrs will rise. the growing database of lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig> synthesized by various archaeal and bacterial phyla and sometimes by the same organism motivated us to address two issues:  what are the incidences, patterns and sources of lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig> lgts between prokaryotes found in current databases of completely sequenced genomes;  what is the likely explanation for the phenomenon of organisms retaining both classes of lysrs? to clarify these issues, we reconstructed the relevant archaeal and bacterial species trees, made the most parsimonious assignments of lysrs classes to the ancestral nodes of the trees, reconstructed lysrs1- <dig> gene trees in order to determine the probable origins of the transferred genes, reviewed the literature for organisms encoding simultaneously two varieties of aarss, albeit of the same class, and evaluated the significance of the experimentally determined distinction between the amino acid binding sites of lysrs1- <dig> in the context of the phenomenon of archaea and bacteria encoding both classes of synthetases.

our analysis of the collected data confirmed that the extant distribution of lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig> reflects a wide-spread lgt – characteristic for the entire aars family of enzymes  <cit> . it enabled us to determine some of the most likely paths and several of the origins of these lgt events, and to elucidate the probable selective advantage to several prokaryotes encoding simultaneously both enzyme classes in the presence of environmentally dependent lysrs inhibitors.

RESULTS
the evolutionary position of organisms coding for lysrs <dig>  lysrs <dig> and both enzymes simultaneously
except for the archaeon cenarchaeum symbiosum whose genome is still being sequenced, all organisms analyzed in this study for the reconstruction of the species trees have had their entire genomes sequenced and annotated. thus, there is a reliable assignment for each organism whether it codes for lysrs <dig> and/or lysrs <dig>  the assignments for archaea and bacteria are presented in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the occurrences of lgt events during the evolution of both bacteria and archaea are evident from the fact that both lysrss are found in the two domains .

lgts in archaea and the lysrs of the last common ancestor of archaea
the most parsimonious assignment of lysrs types to the ancestral nodes in fig.  <dig> requires a minimum of two lgt events . the majority of archaea only code for lysrs <dig>  indeed, according to the most parsimonious reconstruction, their last common ancestor coded for lysrs <dig>  the alternative scenario, in which the ancestor codes for lysrs <dig>  requires two additional lgt events . the three methanosarcinales – m. barkeri, m. acetivorans, and m. mazei – code for both enzyme classes. thus, it seems that their last common ancestor received the gene for lysrs <dig> via lgt. since they are monophyletic, only a single lgt is needed to explain the presence of both enzyme classes in this group.

the situation is more complex in crenarchaeota . in this clade, two families code for lysrs <dig> , and two for lysrs <dig> . there are several possible scenarios that can explain this phenomenon:

 <dig>  the common ancestor of p. aerophilum, s. solfataricus and a. pernix first received a copy of lysrs <dig>  and then lost its copy of lysrs <dig>  subsequently, a. pernix received a copy of lysrs <dig>  and lost its copy of lysrs <dig> .

 <dig>  p. aerophilum after its divergence, gained a copy of lysrs <dig>  and lost its copy of lysrs <dig>  similarly, after its divergence s. solfataricus gained a copy of lysrs <dig>  and lost its copy of lysrs <dig> .

 <dig>  the common ancestor of p. aerophilum, s. solfataticus and a. pernix received a copy of lysrs <dig>  after the divergence of p. aerophilum, this organism lost its class  <dig> copy. the same loss occurred again, after the divergence of s. solfataricus. a third loss, of class  <dig> occurred in the lineage leading to a. pernix. this alternative requires one gain, and three losses.

among these three scenarios, the third requires the least number of lgts. when an organism codes for both classes of lysrs, a loss event of one copy may be sustainable. assuming that a loss of one copy out of two is more likely than a lgt, the third scenario is the most probable one. it should be noted that all these alternatives rely on the correctness of the species tree. however, the phylogeny among p. aerophilum, s. solfataricus and a. pernix  was reconstructed with 100% bootstrap support  <cit> . see section 'are the species-trees correct?' below for further discussion on the robustness of the species tree.

lgts in bacteria and the lysrs of the last common ancestor of bacteria
the most parsimonious assignment of lysrs types to the ancestral nodes in fig.  <dig> requires a minimum of five lgt events . the majority of bacteria only code for lysrs <dig>  it is most parsimonious to assume that the bacterial ancestor coded for lysrs <dig> . among actinobacteria, some species code for lysrs <dig> , and some code for lysrs <dig> . the two species coding for lysrs <dig> are monophyletic  <cit> . thus, it seems that a lysrs <dig> was laterally transferred to the common ancestor of streptomycetes followed by a lysrs <dig> loss. within the firmicutes, b. cereus codes for both lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig>  since this is the only known firmicutae that codes for both types, we conclude that the lysrs <dig> was transferred to this species. within the spirochetes clade, leptospira integrans codes for lysrs <dig>  while in the second group, including the t. pallidum, treponema denticola and borrelia burgdorferi species, the last two species code for lysrs <dig> only, while t. pallidum codes for both lysrs types. this can be explained by a single lgt event  in the common ancestor of t. pallidum, t. denticola, and b. burgdorferi, followed by a lysrs <dig> loss in t. denticola and b. burgdorferi. within the proteobacteria, the beta, gamma, and epsilon clades, all code for lysrs <dig>  only within the alpha-proteobacteria most species code for lysrs <dig> . following the branching pattern of the proteobacteria  it seems that the last common ancestor of the alpha-proteobacteria had gained a copy of lysrs <dig>  and lost its lysrs <dig>  however, the clade including the rhizobiales sinorhizobium meliloti and agrobacterium tumefaciens codes for lysrs <dig>  thus, it seems that in the common ancestor of these species, lysrs <dig> was regained, and lysrs <dig> was lost. this scenario calls for two lgt events and two losses.

gene trees
gene trees summarize our current estimation of the evolutionary relationships among the lysrs sequences. combined with the species tree, gene trees are a valuable source of information concerning the origins of the laterally transferred genes.

the origin of the inferred lgts in archaea
the maximum parsimony analysis has indicated that the ancestor of the archaea most likely coded for lysrs <dig>  we reconstructed a lysrs <dig> gene tree  to track the origin of the genes that were laterally transferred to the archaea. since our species tree  does not contain all the known lysrs <dig> sequences, we used blastp  <cit>  to enlarge our bacterial lysrs <dig> database by choosing the first  <dig> non-redundant sequences –  <dig> from complete genomes and  <dig> encoded by bacteria whose entire genome has not been sequenced yet. asprs sequences were used to root the tree.

the lysrs <dig> genes of p. aerophilum, s. solfataricus, and sulfolobus tokodaii, cluster together in the gene tree with a very high bootstrap value  supporting our conclusion of a single lysrs <dig> lgt to the crenarchaeota clade. this clade has only a low bootstrap value  with respect to genes located on other branches of the tree. two alternatives can explain such a position:  the lgt from bacteria to crenarchaeota is from an ancient ancestor of the bacterial domain or from an extinct bacterial lineage that is an outgroup to most extant bacteria, or from a yet unidentified bacterium.  there is not enough information to resolve the location of this clade within the lysrs <dig> gene tree, as is evident by the low bootstrap value. in the first alternative, it is not very likely that the lgt is from the bacterial ancestor, as we know that the lysrs <dig> lgt to crenarchaeota occurred after the divergence of c. symbiosum . all these possibilities are likely scenarios and further bacterial genome sequencing has the potential to settle this issue.

m. barkeri, m. acetivorans and m. mazei code for both classes of lysrs. the origin of their lysrs <dig> gene is in doubt. the group clusters with the bacterial lineage a. aquifex with a low bootstrap value . again, additional genomic bacterial sequencing might shed light on the history of this lgt event.

the origin of the inferred lgts in bacteria
five lgt events were inferred in the bacterial tree . a gene tree of lysrs <dig> sequences encoded by archaea and bacteria was reconstructed in order to infer the origin of the laterally transferred genes . several lysrs <dig> sequences encoded by bacteria whose complete genomes have not been determined yet – e.g., bradyrhizobium sp, rickettsia sibirica, borella afzelii – were excluded from this study due to high percentage identity,  <dig>   <dig> and 95%, between their sequences and sequences of bacterial lysrs <dig> utilized for the reconstruction of the gene tree . glurs sequences were used to root the tree. the bacterial sequences of the s. coelicolor, s. avermitilis, b. cereus, b. burgdorferi, t. pallidum, and t. denticola, together with the archaeal thermococcaceae clade  cluster together with a very high bootstrap support . such clustering is indicative of a thermococcaceal source for the lysrs <dig> found in all bacterial sequences excluding the alpha proteobacteria.

the lysrs <dig> sequences in alpha proteobacteria cluster with c. symbiosum with a very high bootstrap support . thus, c. symbiosum or a related yet undetermined archaea is the most likely source for the lgt to alpha proteobacteria excluding the two species a. tumerfaciens, and s. meliloti. within the alpha proteobacteria, these two species reversed to a lysrs <dig> class gene. to infer the origin of this reversed lgt, we refer to fig.  <dig>  see discussion, section 'the possible origins of laterally transferred lysrs genes' below, for details.

discussion
most likely scenarios for lysrs lgt
in this study we analyzed the pattern of lysrss lgt based on organisms with fully sequenced genomes, coding for lysrs <dig>  lysrs <dig>  or both. analyzing this information and taking into account the evolutionary relationships among the organisms  made it possible to infer the most likely lgt scenarios. as previously determined by other researchers for the entire family of aars enzymes  <cit> , we also found that lgt for a particular synthetase – lysrs – is quite common in both bacteria and archaea. inferring that the last common ancestors of bacteria and archaea most likely coded for lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig>  respectively, a complex pattern of lgt events emerged: lysrs <dig> was replaced by lysrs <dig>  in a specific group of organisms. in one occasion, a lysrs <dig> to lysrs <dig> lgt was followed by a reversed lgt to lysrs <dig>  within the same group. it should be noted that a transition from one lysrs to another most probably occurred through an intermediate evolutionary stage in which organisms coded for both lysrss  <cit> . examples of extant species embodying such a stage are the three methanosarcinales, b. cereus, and t. pallidum

the lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig> genes coded by t. pallidum probably illustrate an advanced phase of such a transitional stage:  the lysrs <dig> gene only codes for  <dig> residues  <cit> . this region shows a high similarity to the  <dig> residues of the e. coli lysrs <dig> catalytic domain located in the cooh-terminal region. however, the  <dig> residues at the nh2-terminal region in the e. coli enzyme, which includes the  <dig> residues of the trna  anticodon binding domain that are critical for the enzyme's acylation activity, are not coded in t. palladium  <cit> . the observed lack of the lysrs <dig> anticodon binding domain is the result of a lysrs <dig> gene entering the common ancestor of t. palladium and b. burgdorferi by lgt from an archaeal lineage  <cit> . lysrs <dig> proved by some measure more advantageous to treponema than lysrs <dig>  the latter became non-functional, subject in the course of evolution to gradual elimination from the genome accompanying the loss of function.

are the species-trees correct?
our results depend on inferred species trees that might not be the true ones. nevertheless, they do not rely on the existence of clades with low statistical support. for the archaeal tree , m. barkeri, m. acetivorans, and m. mazei which code for both lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig> are monophyletic  <cit> . further, their clustering with hallobacterium is supported with high bootstrap values  <cit> . the phylogenetic position of p. aerophilum, s. solfataricus and a. pernix is also generally accepted  <cit> . for the bacterial tree , there is wide agreement regarding the monophyly of alpha-proteobacteria and the monophyly of spirochetes  <cit> .

the possible origins of laterally transferred lysrs genes
we determined seven lgt events – two in archaea and five in bacteria. one of the main difficulties in the inference of the origins of lgts is that such inference heavily relies on a gene tree. a gene tree is always reconstructed from a single gene, and hence, based on a limited amount of data. thus, the bootstrap values for various bifurcations in the tree are usually not very high. it is well known that increased taxonomical sampling improves such inference  <cit> . to this end, we reconstructed the lysrs gene trees from an extensive database of extant bacteria and archaea. not surprisingly, we could not reliably infer the origins of the two lysrs <dig> lgts to archaea . encouragingly, the possible origins of four of the bacterial lgts  were determined with a high degree of confidence . for example the archeal pyrococci clade seems to contain the closest lysrs <dig> sequences to those of bacterial species . yet, the details of the lgt events are still unknown: these species are hyperthermophiles, inhabiting environments with extremely high temperatures such as undersea hot vents, whereas all the above mentioned bacteria are mesophiles. the physiological and biochemical conditions that promoted such an evolutionary event remain an enigma.

the last intriguing question concerns the lgt reversal of two alpha-proteobacterial species  to code for lysrs <dig>  the bootstrap value clustering them with other bacteria is very low . as both species are capable of nitrogen-fixing  <cit> , we speculate that an extinct nitrogen fixing bacteria may have been the origin of the lysrs <dig> lgt.

additional sequences of bacterial lysrs <dig> genes are likely to shed new light on the evolution of the lysrs <dig> lgt events for which the origin remains uncertain. it is remarkable that the sources of lysrs <dig> lgts are readily identifiable while those for lysrs <dig> remain, for now, shrouded in uncertainty.

possible advantages for organisms coding for both lysrs classes
long before the discovery of archaea and bacteria coding for both lysrss, it was found that some prokaryotes code for two paralogous genes for some synthetases: lyss and lysu in e.coli  <dig>  thrsv and thrs <dig> and tyrs and tyrz, in b. subtilis  <cit> . recently, co-existing forms were published for serrs1/serrs <dig> and trprs1/trprs <dig> in c. acetobutylicum, cysrs1/cysrs <dig> in m. tuberculosis, trprs1/trprs <dig> in e. faecalis  <cit>  and glurs1/glurs <dig> in more than  <dig> bacterial genomes  <cit> . while only some of the functions of the observed redundancies have been determined, it is noteworthy that in some cases it was found that the aars duplications render a selective advantage to the affected organisms providing protection against potentially detrimental effects on protein synthesis caused by amino acid competitors  <cit> .

one example is the streptococcus pneumoniae coding for two distantly related metrs genes. it was found that one of them proves necessary and sufficient for resistance to metrs inhibitors  <cit> . another example is the existence of two ilers variants in pseudomonas fluorescens. this gamma proteobacterium produces the anti-bacterial agent pseudomonic acid , which if not neutralized, competitively inhibits the acylation of trna with isoleucine, thereby shutting off protein synthesis and arresting cell growth. p. fluorescens avoids self destruction by one of its ilers variants binding preferentially to isoleucine, with a remarkably high insensitivity to mupirocin  <cit> .

a related selective advantage is surmised for the prokaryotes coding for both classes of lysrs by the same organism. in the case of lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig>  there is evidence that the former is less sensitive to inhibitors, due to the active site of lysrs <dig> being more compact than that of lysrs <dig>  <cit> , i.e., lysrs <dig> is less accommodating to lysine analogues with backbone substitutions compared with lysrs <dig>  <cit> . this bequeathed a possible selective advantage to b. cereus and t. pallidum after acquiring a copy of lysrs1: harmful lysine-analogues to lysrs in the environment bind preferentially to lysrs <dig>  leaving lysrs <dig> available for unimpeded acylation of lysine to cognate trnas. what could be the possible selective advantage for the methanosarcinales acquiring lysrs2? comparing the rate constants  of lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig> reveals that lysrs <dig> has a substrate turnover speed more than  <dig> times greater than that of lysrs <dig>  while their michaelis constants  values are practically the same  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that the selective advantage for coding lysrs <dig> is in their enhanced ability for protein synthesis. thus, it is possible that bacteria and archaea coding for the two types of lysrs, in fact, developed a "safety net": in the absence of lysrs inhibitors, lysrs <dig> is expected to be the dominant active form. in the presence of inhibitors, lysrs <dig> provides a means for continuing protein synthesis.

noteworthy, recently it was determined that in b. cereus lysrs <dig> and lysrs <dig> aminoacylate two trna species: the canonical trna and a smaller rna annotated trna, which features a tryptophan anticodon  with a non-canonical secondary structure. trna was found to be synthesized only in the presence of both lysrss, which act together during trna aminoacylation. this process is confined to the stationary phase, suggesting a role in growth-phase-specific protein synthesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the lysrs family of enzymes has undergone several complex lgt events. the currently available data were sufficient for unambiguously identifying the origins of lysrs <dig> but not of lysrs <dig> gene transfers. the lgt transition stage of simultaneous encoding lysrs1- <dig> by several archaea and bacteria may confer a selective advantage in the presence of environmentally dependent lysrs inhibitors.
