BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses infect a wide range of animals including humans, pigs, horses, and poultry. however, with the exception of a small number of viruses recently described in bats  <cit> , wild  birds are the natural reservoir for all haemaggluttinin  and neuraminidase  subtypes, harbouring  <dig> of the former and  <dig> of the latter  <cit> . with approximately  <dig>  bird species present in terrestrial and aquatic environments, the often large sizes and densities of bird populations are a boon for the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza. avian influenza  is believed to be largely asymptomatic in wild birds such as waterfowl, causing mild or no symptoms, such that most aivs in these species can be considered to be low pathogenic avian influenza . in contrast, poultry  are not considered as natural hosts for aiv, but can be infected with both lpai and high pathogenic  strains, notably h <dig> and h <dig>  hpai outbreaks may result in high mortality through severe respiratory distress, with major economic costs to the agricultural industries. strikingly, despite the diversity of h and n types in wild birds, only a small number – h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> – have evolved sustained transmission in humans, indicating that there are major adaptive barriers associated with the bird to mammal species jump  <cit> .

it is similarly noteworthy that aiv outbreaks in poultry have only been associated with a relatively small number of h and n subtypes, suggesting that there are important species barriers within birds. a question that has been less frequently addressed is whether evolutionary patterns and processes also differ between wild birds and poultry? indeed, there are a number of factors that could create important evolutionary differences between aiv in wild birds and poultry, notably reflecting differences in the mode of transmission and population structure. in particular, the transmission of aiv between wild birds largely occurs through an indirect faecal-oral route, in which, following excretion, the virus sits in an aquatic environment before infecting another host  <cit> . importantly, there is growing evidence that aiv is able to remain in these water environments for several weeks, although this is dependent on the physico-chemical characteristics of the water source in question, and the presence of microorganisms which limit aiv infectiousness  <cit> . critically, while present in the environment, aiv will effectively be in a “latent” state, such that there will be no viral replication and no mutational accumulation. in contrast, aiv transmission in poultry is more likely to be a function of close contact  and rapid faecal-oral transmission, without an extended latent period in water. hence, a simple prediction from these differing modes of transmission is that evolutionary rates in aiv will be lower in wild birds than in poultry. similarly, it is possible that the rapidity of aiv outbreaks in poultry increases the number of viral replications per unit time which, depending on the fitness of the mutations involved, may also increase evolutionary rates. finally, selection pressures may also differ between wild birds and poultry. high-density poultry populations are dominated by the presence of a single viral subtype  within which there may be strong selection pressure on the virus to escape from increasing host immunity  <cit> . indeed, hp h5n <dig> has been characterized by steady antigenic change  since its emergence  <cit> . in contrast, weaker antigenic drift might be expected in wild bird populations that experience concurrent infections with multiple antigenically distinct subtypes  <cit> . to date, however, these fundamental differences between wild birds and poultry have not been incorporated into evolutionary models, including molecular clock dating.

most estimates of nucleotide substitution rates for influenza virus inferred using temporally sampled viruses point to rates in the order of 10− <dig> substitution per site, per year , in which genes coding for the external h and n proteins have higher evolutionary rates than internal genes  <cit> . the estimation of evolutionary rates in a statistical framework relies on the applicability of a molecular clock where the substitution rate can be constrained to be constant over time, or vary across time and among lineages. methods that model rate heterogeneity include auto-correlation of rates among lineages  <cit> , and uncorrelated models that allow rates assigned to lineages to be drawn from an underlying probability distribution  <cit> . yoder and yang  modelled rate heterogeneity among lineage  using local clock models, a method that was recently reinvestigated using modern bayesian-based sampling methods  <cit> . this clock model allows phylogenetically related lineages to evolve at exactly the same rate. all these models are evidently oversimplifications of the substitution process and tend to provide different estimates, illustrating the need for the development of accurate model selection methods. recently, worobey et al.  <cit>  used host-specific local clocks to infer the history of influenza a viruses and showed that the substitution rate of avian viruses were significantly higher than the human rate, although slightly lower or equal to the rate in swine. in this study, horses, birds, swine and humans are assumed to evolve at different rates, while viruses within each host are constrained to evolve at the same constant rate . critically, therefore, it was assumed that all aivs evolve at the same rate, although the major ecological differences between wild birds and poultry noted above mean that this may be a simplification. indeed, it is expected that the estimated substitution rates will be an average of multiple substitution rates that reflect the proportion of each viral subtype in the data set analysed.

to investigate the evolutionary rate heterogeneity of aiv, and particularly whether there is a systematic difference in rates between wild birds and poultry, we compiled data sets for the pb <dig>  pb <dig>  and pa internal genes representing aiv in these very different ecological contexts. these genes should be suitable for inferring substitution rates as they are the longest in the viral genome, are considered to be under moderate  selection pressures, and different lineages often circulate in wild birds and poultry, facilitating the direct comparison of aiv in these two types of host species. accordingly, for poultry, we examined sequences from the h5n <dig>  subtype that has caused major outbreaks since  <dig>  while for wild birds we examined the commonly observed h <dig> and h <dig> subtypes .

RESULTS
the mcmc-based  analysis shows that the mean nucleotide substitution rate of aiv varies between  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> subs/site/year depending on the model used. these results consistently show significant lower rates  in those subtypes associated with wild birds  compared to poultry  . to further test this separation we analysed a monophyletic group of h <dig> viruses  that persisted in the poultry population rather than in their usual wild bird hosts. strikingly, estimates of substitution rates in these poultry h <dig> viruses are similar to those in h5n <dig> from poultry and significantly higher than those of h <dig> from wild birds , confirming that aiv evolutionary rates are elevated in poultry. similarly, estimates of the mean ω  and the number of positively selected sites revealed consistent differences in selection pressures between h5n <dig> and the other subtypes . in particular, the mean ω of the h5n <dig> genes is substantially higher than those of h <dig> and h <dig>  while no significant difference was observed between pa, pb <dig> and pb <dig> fig.  <dig> evolutionary rates of avian influenza virus  among poultry and wild birds for three internal genes . the nucleotide substitution rate per site of each gene was analysed using beast. mean substitution rates and 95 % bayesian confidence intervals estimated under strict  and lognormal  molecular clocks are reported. * denotes a lineage of h <dig> viruses from poultry

h <dig> and h <dig> data sets contain wild birds only, while h5n <dig> and h6* are poultry-only data sets. mean ω and the number of positively selected sites for each gene of each subtype were estimated using fubar. separate ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates for external  and internal  branches were estimated using hyphy



this important discrepancy in evolutionary rates between those aiv subtypes that circulate in wild birds compared to poultry can be explained in at least two ways. first, this variation in rate could reflect underlying ecological differences. in particular, substitution rates may be reduced in wild birds because of the latent period associated with environmental  transmission. in contrast, more frequent contact transmission in poultry may lead to more replications, and hence a greater number of mutations, per unit time  <cit> . selection pressures may also differ between wild birds and poultry, as revealed here , and there is evidence for host-driven antigenic drift in h5n <dig>  <cit>  which would be expected to increase evolutionary rates, especially at nonsynonymous sites. second, because of heightened scientific attention, h5n <dig> has been more densely sampled than the other subtypes. it is possible that such intensive sampling may have increased the number of recently diverged sequences and hence the relative proportion of slightly deleterious mutations that are yet to be removed by purifying selection, in turn increasing rates toward the present  <cit> . indeed, our analysis of selection pressures revealed that the mean values of ω were higher for h5n <dig> than for h <dig> and h <dig> . to determine whether this increase of ω in h5n <dig> was indeed due to a higher frequency of transient deleterious mutations, or stronger positive selection, we examined ω values on internal and external branches of the phylogenies . notably, in every data set there was a significantly higher ω on external  branches compared to internal  branches . importantly, however, the ωe/ωi ratio of the h5n <dig> data sets were consistently the lowest, such that this subtype has experienced proportionally more nonsynonymous mutations on internal branches and compatible with stronger positive selection. hence, the elevated substitution rates in h5n <dig> are unlikely to be a function of sampling density.

our analysis further reveals that the mean substitution rate of the h <dig> subtype is consistently higher than that observed in h <dig> subtype. this disparity is surprising considering that both subtypes infect the same wild bird species and continuously reassort such that they often do not form distinct monophyletic groups, and have nearly identical selection profiles. interestingly, however, chickens may be infected more frequently by the h <dig> than the h <dig> subtype. taking the pa gene as an example, 7 % of all h <dig> sequences available on genbank come from chickens, while the corresponding number for h <dig> is  <dig>  % . while the more frequent circulation of the h <dig> lineage in the poultry population could explain the elevated rate in this subtype, this clearly needs to be confirmed on a larger and less biased data sample.

also of note was that estimates of the mean substitution rate under an uncorrelated lognormal clock model are significantly higher than those estimated under a strict clock model. considering the size of the data sets, the calculation of bayes factors with computer intensive methods such as path sampling  <cit>  is prohibitive. instead we computed the aicm for each model  and the results reveal the presence of rate heterogeneity in most data sets.

it is not straightforward to compare our estimates of the times to common ancestry to those of worobey et al.  <cit>  since the most recent common ancestor of all avian viruses  is not necessarily the mrca of the subtypes analysed here. for example, h5n <dig> is the most recent lineage and originated between  <dig> and  <dig> years ago depending on the molecular clock model used, while the h <dig> and h <dig> subtypes have a tmrca of at least  <dig> years but do not predate  <dig> as suggested by the previous local clock analysis . however, it is apparent that our estimates of root age are consistently younger than those of worobey et al., suggesting that accounting for rate heterogeneity can lead to surprisingly different results  <cit> .table  <dig> estimates of time to the most recent common under the best model for each aiv data set

CONCLUSIONS
the estimates of nucleotide substitution rate presented here reveal a more complex picture of the evolutionary processes driving the evolution of avian influenza virus than previously thought. most notably, it is clear that a single substitution rate cannot be applied to wild birds and poultry equally, as the evolutionary rates are consistently lower in the former and which may reflect a greater role for environmental transmission. hence, it is evidently incorrect to impose a single substitution to aiv sampled from hosts as diverse as wild birds and poultry, and that molecular clock estimates based on a single rate may be erroneous. similarly, rates differ significantly between the strict and relaxed clock models. it is therefore likely that the evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza virus can only be captured by new models that allow rates to vary in a more complex manner along lineages and which reflect changes in the underlying ecology.
