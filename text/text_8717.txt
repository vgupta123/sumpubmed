BACKGROUND
the conserved notch signaling pathway has well established roles in cell fate determination during development. transmembrane notch receptors are activated by transmembrane dsl  family ligands  <cit> . the intracellular  domain of notch is proteolytically released by presenilins and translocates to the nucleus  <cit> , where it acts as a transcriptional activator abetted by csl /lag-1) proteins  <cit> . in c. elegans, the lin- <dig> notch receptor is activated by lag- <dig> and related dsl ligands  <cit> , and proteolytically processed by the presenilins sel- <dig> and hop- <dig>  <cit> . the csl protein lag- <dig> interacts with lin-12ic to activate transcription of target genes  <cit> .

notch receptors and ligands are expressed in adult vertebrate neurons  <cit> ; recent studies in drosophila and mice suggest that altering notch signaling results in defective neuronal function . the importance of these findings is underscored by the fact that several genetic diseases associated with neuronal defects and/or late onset symptoms map to mutations in notch pathway genes  <cit> . however, it remains unclear from these studies whether notch signaling is acutely affecting neuronal physiology or if it is causing permanent changes in cell fate and/or structure due to developmental defects or aberrant growth.

here, we report a new role for lin- <dig> signaling in the adult c. elegans nervous system, using behavior as an indicator of neuronal activity. c. elegans predominantly move forward, but they spontaneously initiate backward locomotion. genetically modulating lin- <dig> activity alters the rate of initiation of spontaneous reversals. using inducible rnai and a conditional, gain-of-function allele of lin- <dig>  we show that this behavioral change can occur within a few hours of altering lin- <dig> activity in post-developmental adults. we also show that these inducible behavioral changes are rapidly reversible, strongly suggesting that lin- <dig> mediated behavioral changes are unlikely due to changes in cell fate. altering lin- <dig> activity in a subset of interneurons is sufficient to alter behavior. glr- <dig>  an ampa/kainate receptor homolog gene expressed in these interneurons, genetically interacts with lin- <dig>  our results demonstrate a novel, post-developmental role for lin- <dig> signaling that is clearly distinct from its role in cell fate determination.

RESULTS
altering lin- <dig> activity increases spontaneous reversals during locomotion
to assess a role for lin- <dig> notch signaling in behavior, we first examined spontaneous reversal rates during locomotion in lin- <dig> mutant animals . normal animals moving forward consistently initiate backward locomotion approximately  <dig> times per  <dig> minutes. reversal rates were significantly increased in lin- <dig> loss of function  animals, which completely lack lin- <dig> gene function. the behavioral defect of lin- <dig> animals was rescued by a previously described transgene containing a lin- <dig> cdna driven by the lin- <dig> promoter  <cit> . furthermore, lin- <dig> behavioral defects could be recapitulated by rnai . these results indicated that loss of function in lin- <dig> caused increased reversal rates.

the effect of increased lin- <dig> activity on reversal rates was then assessed using lin- <dig> , a gain of function, cold sensitive  allele  <cit> . reversals were not significantly increased in lin- <dig> animals raised at the permissive temperature , but were dramatically increased in animals raised at the restrictive temperature . cultivation temperature had no effect on reversal rate in wild type animals. the increased reversal rate of lin- <dig> animals was due to increased lin- <dig> activity, as transgenic animals that overexpress lin- <dig> ) also had increased reversals. thus, both gain and loss of function in lin- <dig> causes increased reversal rates.

an allelic series of lin- <dig> mutants reveals complex regulation of behavior
to further characterize the relationship between lin- <dig> activity and reversal rates, we assessed behavior across the lin- <dig> allelic series ordered based on the severity of previously determined vulval defects . lin- <dig> alleles can be grouped into  <dig> classes: strong loss of function, weak gain of function, moderate gain of function, and strong gain of function. lin- <dig> null animals are sterile and display protruding vulva that usually burst in adult animals; these animals had increased reversals. the vulval and reversal phenotypes of lin-12/+ animals were normal, indicating that the lin- <dig> mutation is recessive. lin- <dig>  lin- <dig>  and lin- <dig> are weak gain of function alleles  <cit> ; these animals were fertile, vulvaless, and had slightly decreased reversal rates. lin- <dig> acts as a moderate gain of function allele; these animals are cold-sensitive, display multiple pseudovulvae at the restrictive temperature, and had increased reversals. finally, lin- <dig> and lin- <dig> are strong gain of function alleles that display multiple pseudovulvae and had strongly decreased reversals. we note that lin-12/lin- <dig> hemizygote animals have multiple pseudovulvae and have high reversal rates consistent with lin- <dig> phenotypes. since lin-12p::lin- <dig>  and other transgenic animals overexpressing lin- <dig>  recapitulate the moderate lin- <dig> gain of function allele, we expected that injection of the lin-12p::lin- <dig> construct at a higher concentration would lead to transgenic animals that recapitulate the strong lin- <dig> gain of function alleles. however, we were unable to generate viable transgenic lines using higher concentrations of lin-12p::lin- <dig> . we conclude that altering lin- <dig> activity results in complex changes in the pattern of reversal behavior; the implications of this allelic series are discussed below.

altering lin- <dig> activity in adult animals is sufficient to increase reversal rates
lin- <dig> notch plays well established roles in development. therefore, we asked whether increased reversals in lin- <dig> mutant animals depended on lin- <dig> activity during development or in adults. lin- <dig> loss of function was induced by expressing an inverted repeat of a lin- <dig> cdna fragment under the control of a heat shock promoter to knock down lin- <dig> activity by rnai ) in otherwise normal adult animals . uninduced hsp::lin- <dig> adult animals  raised at 25°c had normal reversal rates, while heat shock induction resulted in dramatically increased reversal rates within  <dig> hours. reversals returned to near basal levels after overnight recovery . heat shock had no effect on wild type control animals . as a control, we generated transgenic animals containing an inverted repeat of a cdna fragment from the gprotein coupled receptor kinase- <dig> grk-2) gene under control of the heat shock promoter ). grk- <dig> loss of function causes sensory defects  <cit> , but had no effect on reversal rates . heat shock induction of hsp::grk- <dig> did not alter reversal rates , indicating that neither the presence of the heat shock vector nor overexpression of an unrelated dsrna influenced reversal rates. we conclude that loss of function of lin- <dig> in adult animals is sufficient to alter behavior.

we examined lin- <dig> animals in temperature shift experiments . lin- <dig> adults raised at the restrictive temperature 15°c  initially had increased reversal rates. when these animals were moved to the permissive temperature of 25°c , reversal rates gradually decreased, and after  <dig> hours reversals decreased to wild type levels. in reciprocal experiments, lin- <dig> adults raised at 25°c  initially had almost normal reversal rates. when they were moved to 15°c , reversal rates gradually increased until they reached levels comparable to those of lin- <dig> animals raised at 15°c. when these animals were moved back to 25°c , reversal rates decreased to original levels within  <dig> hours. temperature shifts and cultivation temperature had only minimal effects on control wild type animals . taken together, these data demonstrate that altering lin- <dig> notch activity for a few hours in post-developmental adult animals is sufficient to change behavior and suggests that lin- <dig> activity is regulating a physiological, not a developmental, process.

lin- <dig> is not required in the vulval lineage to regulate reversals
where does lin- <dig> function to regulate reversal rates? lin- <dig> is expressed in the somatic gonad and vulval lineages, based on previous studies using a functional lin-12::gfp transgene  <cit> . to test if lin- <dig> activity in these tissues regulated reversal rates, we eliminated the somatic gonad and the vulva by killing the progenitor cells of these lineages using a laser and then determining the reversal rates of the operated animals. vulval development depends on cell-cell signaling from the anchor cell to the vulval precursor cells  <cit> . the anchor cell  is derived from one of two equipotent cells called z <dig> and z <dig> in l <dig> larvae; thus, killing z <dig> and z <dig> results in animals that lack gonads and vulvae.

wild type z1-z4-killed adult animals had normal reversal rates, indicating that these tissues play no role in regulating the reversal rate in wild type animals . we tested the role of the vulval and gonadal lineages in regulating reversal rates in lin- <dig>  and lin-12p::lin- <dig> animals. z1-z4-killed lin- <dig> and lin-12p::lin- <dig> animals maintained high reversal rates comparable to mock treated animals. these data indicate that lin- <dig> must function outside of the somatic gonad and vulva to regulate reversal rates.

we considered the possibility that the gross morphological vulval defects in lin- <dig> mutant animals, but not lin- <dig> signaling per se, might account for changes in reversal rates. lin- <dig> animals have a large protruding vulva, while lin- <dig> animals raised at the restrictive temperature 15°c have multiple pseudovulvae. we measured basal locomotion rates in lin- <dig> and lin- <dig> animals and found that they had slight but significant decreases in basal movement rate . however, lin- <dig> and lin-12p::lin- <dig> animals, which phenocopy the reversal phenotypes but not the vulval phenotypes of the mutant animals, had normal basal movement rates. these data indicate that morphological defects of the vulva in lin- <dig> mutant animals cannot account for the altered behavior. taken together, we conclude that lin- <dig> expressed in the vulva and somatic gonad does not contribute to the regulation of reversal rates during locomotion.

lin- <dig> acts in a subset of glr- <dig> expressing neurons to regulate reversals
lin- <dig> might act in or upon neurons to control c. elegans behavior. previous studies have implicated the command interneurons ava, avb, avd, ave and pvc in regulating normal forward and backward locomotion  <cit> . the intrinsic activation of these interneurons affects reversal rates  <cit> . other neurons presynaptic to the command interneurons, such as ash  <cit>  and aiy  <cit> , can affect reversal rates as well. we did not detect any overt cell fate changes or morphological defects in any of these or other neurons in lin- <dig>  lin- <dig> or lin- <dig> mutant animals , consistent with a previous report  <cit>  and supporting our conclusion that lin- <dig> mediated behavioral changes were not due to developmental defects. lin- <dig> expression was not detected in any of these neurons either by immunohistochemical analysis or by gfp fluorescence . however, occasional lin-12::gfp expression was observed in the rig neurons of young larvae . these observations and the preceding temperature shift experiments suggested that lin- <dig> may be expressed in adult neurons at levels too low to detect. increasing lin-12::gfp levels further caused lethality ; therefore, a functional approach was taken to determine whether lin- <dig> acts in the nervous system.

lin- <dig> activity was knocked down by rnai in a subset of neurons by expressing lin- <dig> dsrna under the control of the glr- <dig> promoter, which drives expression in the aforementioned command interneurons and twelve other classes of neurons including rig  <cit>  ). because rnai effects can spread systemically  <cit> , we first validated the cellular specificity of this approach. the lin- <dig> cdna fragment used to generate the glr-1::lin- <dig> constructs was derived from a lin-12::gfp fusion; thus, the dsrna expressed in these transgenic animals contains both lin- <dig> and gfp sequences. when glr-1p::lin- <dig> constructs were injected into strains that express gfp in the intestine or in ash sensory neurons , no decreases in gfp fluorescence were observed . furthermore, these transgenic animals had grossly normal fertility and vulval morphology . thus, rnai effects did not appear to spread from glr- <dig> expressing neurons to nearby neurons, the intestine, or to the vulva. also, we found that transgenic animals injected with the glr- <dig> promoter fragment alone ) or constructs expressing gfp only dsrna under control of the glr- <dig> promoter had no effect on reversal rates . when we examined the behavior of glr-1p::lin- <dig> animals, we found that reversal rates increased significantly. thus, knocking down lin- <dig> activity in glr- <dig> expressing neurons was sufficient to recapitulate lin- <dig> behavioral defects.

the requirement for lin- <dig> activity in the nervous system was also tested by driving lin- <dig> cdna expression using the glr- <dig> promoter . increasing lin- <dig> activity by overexpressing either a full length lin- <dig> cdna or a truncated, activated form of lin- <dig> under the control of the glr- <dig> promoter  and glr-1p::lin-12ic, respectively) also increased reversal rates. expression of gfp using the glr- <dig> promoter  as a control had no effect . finally and most significantly, expression of the lin- <dig> cdna under the control of the glr- <dig> promoter ) rescued the behavioral defects of lin- <dig> animals, restoring reversal rates to wild type levels . these results demonstrate that lin- <dig> activity in glr- <dig> expressing neurons is sufficient to regulate reversal rates.

increased lin- <dig> activity affects reversal rates via rig neurons
the rig neurons, in which we observed weak lin-12::gfp expression, express glr- <dig>  interestingly, the rig neurons are presynaptic to command interneurons. the role of rig neurons in spontaneous reversal rates was tested by laser ablation. laser ablation of the rig neurons did not dramatically affect reversal rates in wild type or lin- <dig> animals. however, eliminating the rig neurons of lin-12p::lin- <dig> animals ameliorated reversal rate increases , thus, increased lin- <dig> function in the rig neurons is likely responsible for increased reversal rates in lin-12p::lin- <dig> animals.

despite the fact that lin- <dig> overexpression recapitulated lin- <dig> behavioral defects, we considered the possibility that the lin-12p::lin- <dig> transgene might act ectopically or during development to alter reversal rates. increasing lin- <dig> activity in adult lin- <dig> animals in temperature shift experiments was sufficient to increase reversal rates . therefore, we carried out rig laser ablations in lin- <dig> animals, using the same temperature shift paradigm described above . rig killed, temperature shifted lin- <dig> animals had normal reversal rates, while mock treated lin- <dig> control animals retained high reversal rates. we conclude that increased lin- <dig> activity in the rig neurons of adult animals increases reversal rates.

genes that interact with lin- <dig> to regulate reversals
to determine if the canonical lin- <dig> signaling pathway regulates spontaneous reversal rates, we examined the reversal rates of animals that are defective in genes of the lin- <dig> pathway, specifically lag- <dig>  and lag- <dig>  . the reversal rates of partial loss-of-function lag- <dig> and lag- <dig> mutant animals were relatively normal. however, partial loss of lag- <dig> function suppressed increased reversal rates in glr-1p::lin-12ic animals that had constitutively activated lin- <dig> signaling, consistent with lag- <dig> functioning downstream of lin- <dig> regulating reversal rates. also, a semidominant allele of lag- <dig> that suppresses the lin- <dig> gain-of-function multivulval phenotype caused increased reversal rates. although strong loss of function alleles could not be tested due to embryonic lethality, our results suggest that lin- <dig>  lag- <dig>  and lag- <dig> likely act together in the nervous system to regulate reversals.

finally, given the previously described role of the glr- <dig> ampa receptor in the command interneurons  <cit> , we examined more closely the role of glr- <dig> in spontaneous reversals and lin- <dig> mediated behavioral changes . consistent with a previous report, complete loss of glr- <dig> function ) alone had no effect on reversal rates  <cit> . however, we found that overexpression of glr- <dig> ) increased spontaneous reversal rates. we note that different constructs are used here than previous studies  <cit>   and that reversal rates can be dependent on assay conditions. both glr-1;lin-12p::lin- <dig> and glr-1;glr-1p::lin- <dig> animals had dramatically decreased reversal rates . yet, there were no dramatic changes in the expression of a glr-1p::gfp transcriptional reporter in lin- <dig>  or  animals . our results suggest that glr- <dig> ampa receptor activity, but not levels, are modulated by lin- <dig> signaling to regulate reversals.

discussion
in this study we demonstrate a non-developmental role for lin- <dig> notch in the adult nervous system regulating c. elegans behavior. lin- <dig> mediated behavioral changes can be rapidly induced within a few hours in adult animals and are reversible. knocking down lin- <dig> activity by rnai or by activating lin- <dig> in glr- <dig> expressing neurons is sufficient to reproduce the behavioral defects of lin- <dig> mutant animals. the rapidity with which behavioral changes can be induced in post-developmental adult animals argues that neither lin- <dig> mediated cell fate changes nor de novo neurite outgrowth are the likely mechanisms for altering behavior. rather, our results are consistent with a novel role for lin- <dig> signaling acutely regulating neuronal physiology via transcriptional activation, clearly distinct from previously described roles in cell fate specification.

signaling pathways used to pattern the developing nervous system can also play important roles in the adult nervous system. for example, ephrins and eph receptors function both in nervous system patterning during development and in synaptic plasticity in the adult nervous system . recent studies suggest that notch signaling may also play a role in adult neurons. in drosophila, adult animals harboring temperature sensitive, loss-of-function notch alleles are defective for long term memory formation after one to two days at the restrictive temperature  <cit> . in mice, notch <dig> and cbf <dig> heterozygous adult animals have specific defects in spatial learning and memory  <cit> . similarly, adult mice in which notch protein levels have been partially depleted by antisense rna are defective in long term potentiation   <cit> . conditional knockout of both presenilin genes in the postnatal forebrain in mice results in defects in long-term contextual memory and ltp, when assayed in two month old animals  <cit> . our heat shock and temperature shift experiments indicate that behavioral defects appear within hours, suggesting that notch mediated alterations in neuronal function can occur on a much shorter timescale than days  <cit>  or months  <cit>  as previously reported.

the lin- <dig> allelic series for reversal rates is complex. in particular, lin- <dig> gain-of-function hemizygotes, heterozygotes, and homozygotes all have high reversal rates, while stronger gain-of-function alleles  have decreased reversals, raising the possibility that lin- <dig> could be a neomorphic allele. several lines of evidence argue against this hypothesis. first, based on vulval phenotypes, there is no evidence of any neomorphic activity. lin- <dig>  which is a recessive hypermorphic allele, is a revertant of lin- <dig>  a dominant hypermorphic allele; the n <dig> mutation confers a temperature sensitive, partial loss of function onto n <dig>  <cit> . both the n <dig> and the n137n <dig> alleles cause multiple pseudovulvae, indicating that lin- <dig> is simply a weaker hypermorph than lin- <dig>  second, modestly increasing lin- <dig> activity through several other independent means also caused increased reversals. these include moderate overexpression of lin- <dig> ) at levels that do not affect fertility and vulval development, and placing the strong hypermorphic allele lin- <dig> over the null allele  animals).

we favor the hypothesis that the unconventional lin- <dig> allelic series for reversal rates reflects the underlying complexity of notch signaling and the neuronal signaling pathways that regulate behavior. lin- <dig> acts at multiple places during vulval cell fate specification, specifically the ac/vu decision and vpc lateral inhibition, resulting in a complex allelic series for vulval phenotypes. similarly, lin- <dig> gain and loss of function may have different cellular foci for action in the nervous system, making it difficult to predict the behavioral output based on simple genetic rules. this is partially supported by the rig ablation studies, wherein killing rig neurons in lin- <dig> gain of function animals ameliorated reversal increases, but had no effect in lin- <dig> loss of function animals. alternatively, lin- <dig> may act coordinately with other genes to regulate reversals. further genetic studies may lead to a clearer picture. consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that glp- <dig>  another c. elegans notch homolog, modulates reversal rates . our data suggest that lin- <dig> regulates reversal rates in a complex fashion.

the behavioral changes observed in lin- <dig> animals are dramatically dependent on glr- <dig> ampa receptor function. taken together with our finding that lin- <dig> acts in glr- <dig> expressing neurons to regulate reversals, it suggests a possible relationship between ampa receptors and notch receptors in post-developmental synaptic plasticity. this is consistent with a recent study that demonstrated that altering notch signaling caused defects in ltp in mice  <cit> . based on our genetic analysis, glr- <dig> may be a target of lin- <dig> signaling or lin- <dig> signaling may act in parallel with glr- <dig>  for example, lin- <dig> signaling may modulate other glutamate-gated currents to influence membrane excitability. consistent with this hypothesis, loss of function in avr- <dig>  one of several semi-redundant c. elegans genes encoding conserved glutamate-gated chloride channel subunits  <cit> , results in increased reversals. avr- <dig> is expressed in the ava command interneurons  and chloride currents have been observed in these interneurons  <cit> , making avr- <dig> a candidate target for regulation by lin- <dig> signaling. similarly, loss of function of nmr- <dig>  which encodes an nmda glutamate receptor subunit, results in decreased spontaneous reversals  <cit> , suggesting that nmr- <dig> activity could be influenced by lin- <dig>  additional behavioral and genetic analysis will be required to further delineate the targets of lin- <dig> signaling in adult neurons.

it should be noted that defects in notch signaling can result in pleiotropic developmental disorders and nervous system dysfunction. cadasil syndrome is associated with mutations in human notch <dig> and is characterized by seizures, late onset neurodegeneration and vascular defects  <cit> . mutations in jagged <dig>  are implicated in alagille syndrome, which is characterized by defects in liver, cardiac, and skeletal tissues, and less frequently, neurovascular defects and mental retardation  <cit> . familial, early onset alzheimer's disease is often caused by mutations in presenilin  <dig> or presenilin  <dig>  <cit> . the developmental defects associated with cadasil and alagille syndromes make it difficult to establish a role for notch signaling in neurons, but it may play a role in the defects observed in some of the late-onset symptoms. given the emerging role for notch signaling in the adult nervous system, a role for defective notch signaling in these and other neurological disorders warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated a novel role for lin- <dig> notch in caenorhabditis elegans in the adult nervous system. changing lin- <dig> activity postdevelopmentally in adult animals alters the spontaneous reversal rates during locomotion. lin- <dig> activity in the vulva and somatic gonad, where lin- <dig> expression was previously reported, is not required to control reversal rates. in contrast, altering lin- <dig> activity in specific neurons is sufficient to alter behavior. lin- <dig> likely acts through the canonical notch signaling pathway that includes the ligand lag- <dig> and the downstream effector lag- <dig>  the neuronal function of lin- <dig> is clearly independent from cell fate specification during development.
