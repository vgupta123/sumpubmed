BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a major etiological agent of pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis, and other respiratory pathology. macrolides remain a primary antibiotic choice for physicians treating such infections due to their broad spectrum of activity, patient tolerance, easy outpatient treatment, high achievable tissue concentrations, and anti-inflammatory properties. use of macrolides has led to increased rates of resistance in s. pneumoniae  <cit>  and even clinical treatment failure in several cases  <cit> . macrolide resistance rates in clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae vary greatly among countries  <cit> .

the main mechanisms of macrolide resistance in s. pneumoniae also vary geographically. the erm encoded methylation of the ribosomal macrolide target site, which confers high-level macrolide resistance as well as resistance to lincosamides and streptogramin b , is the prevalent mechanism in some asian, european, middle eastern, and african countries  <cit> . the mef encoded efflux pump conferring low-level macrolide resistance  is more prevalent in other asian and european countries and north america  <cit> .

s. pneumoniae clones carrying both genes  have emerged as important clinical populations. these strains have serotypes not covered by the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  released in  <dig> and are multidrug resistant, posing a significant health threat.  <cit> . these dual-positive s. pneumoniae strains now comprise a substantial portion of macrolide resistant isolates in regions across the globe  <cit> .

a primary vehicle for lateral transfer of both genes is tn <dig>  a transposon of the tetracycline resistance gene tet-carrying tn <dig> family with an inserted erm element and mef-containing mega element  <cit> . a second transposon carrying both ermand mef, tn <dig>  comprised of tn <dig> with the erm-carrying tn <dig> and the mega element inserted, was found in a hungarian isolate from  <dig>  <cit> . tn916-family transposons with various insertions are the basis of most erm-carrying mobile genetic elements, while mef is known to be only in variants of the mega element  <cit> .

in this study, we characterize a set of macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae clinical isolates collected in arizona based on mef and erm gene presence, multilocus sequence typing  and serotyping, antibiotic susceptibility profiles, and potential transposon carriage. we document likely episodes of capsule switching and serotype replacement, both mechanisms that allow s. pneumoniae to evade the pcv <dig> and cause infection in an immunized population.

methods
bacterial isolates
from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> s. pneumoniae isolates were collected by a large hospital reference laboratory that receives specimens from ten system-wide medical centers and a high volume private reference laboratory that receives specimens from regional inpatient, long-term care, and outpatient facilities. isolates considered non-invasive were obtained from upper respiratory tract , lower respiratory tract, ear, eye, body fluid, wound, and tissue . isolates considered invasive were obtained from blood , urine , and cerebrospinal fluid  specimens. all were identified by bile solubility and optochin susceptibility testing. patients ranged in age from  <dig> month to  <dig> years with a median age of  <dig> years and mean age of  <dig> 1/2years.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
in vitro susceptibility testing followed clinical and laboratory standards institute  recommended methodologies and interpretational zone of inhibition diameter and minimal inhibitory concentration  breakpoints  <cit> . susceptibilities were determined for most isolates for penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole by disk agar-diffusion , manual microdilution , or gradient strip agar diffusion  testing.

dna extraction
bacterial dna was extracted for pcr using dneasy blood and tissue kit  following manufacturer's instructions for gram-positive bacteria with the addition of 200u of mutanolysin .

real-time pcr
isolates were screened with commercial real-time pcr assays to detect mef, mef, erm, and tet . real-time pcr was carried out in  <dig> μl reactions containing  <dig> μl 2x taqman universal pcr mastermix ,  <dig>  μl 20x assay mix, and  <dig>  ng genomic dna template. screening was done on the 7900ht  using the following thermal cycling conditions: 50°c for  <dig> min, 95°c for  <dig> min, and  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s, 60°c for  <dig> min.

multilocus sequence typing and serotyping
multilocus sequence typing  was performed using primer pairs described in the mlst database http://spneumoniae.mlst.net/ <cit> . allele profiles and sequence types were also obtained from the database. strains differing by one of the seven mlst loci were designated single-locus variants .

pcr deduction of serotypes was performed on select isolates as described at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/pcr.htm <cit> , with the addition of a previously described pcr to differentiate serotype 6a from 6b  <cit> .

transposon detection pcr
primers previously described, some with slight modifications to adjust melting temperatures, were used to detect regions of transposons known to carry antibiotic resistance genes . in brief, selected isolates were subject to pcr using primers for the genes int and xis, and tnpr and tnpa to detect the presence of transposons in the tn <dig> and tn <dig> families respectively  <cit> . depending on their resistance gene profile, some isolates positive for only tn <dig> were subject to pcr using the following primer pairs: sg <dig> and ltf  <cit>  to substantiate the presence of tn <dig> or tn <dig> with a  <dig> kb pcr product, eb <dig>  <cit>  and tn <dig>  <cit>  to confirm tn <dig> with a  <dig>  kb pcr product, and j <dig> and j <dig> to detect and differentiate tn <dig>  from tn6003/tn <dig>   <cit> . isolates positive for both transposon families were subject to pcr using primers j <dig> and j <dig> to detect tn <dig> with an  <dig> bp pcr product. amplicon presence or absence and sizes analyzed via gel electrophoresis guided the identification of transposon presence and type; authors concede these are presumptions based on published transposon maps and therefore limited data.

RESULTS
macrolide resistance
in our collection of  <dig> s. pneumoniae isolates,  <dig>  are erythromycin resistant, including only  <dig> of the  <dig> invasive isolates. within the erythromycin resistant population, at least  <dig>  are multidrug resistant, defined here as resistant to antibiotics in at least  <dig> different classes or  <dig> classes and positive for the tet gene if not tested for tetracycline susceptibility.

of the  <dig> erythromycin resistant strains,  <dig>  were mef-positive including three invasive isolates,  <dig>  were erm-positive including one invasive isolate, and  <dig>  were dual mef/erm-positive including one invasive isolate. one isolate was positive for mef. nine  were negative for the macrolide resistance genes and no further analyses were conducted to determine their resistance mechanisms. thirty-eight of the mef-positive isolates expressed the m-phenotype while six expressed the mlsb phenotype, manifesting alternative clindamycin resistance mechanisms. all  <dig> erm-positive isolates showed mlsb. sixty-eight of the dual-positive isolates showed mlsb; the remaining five expressed the m-phenotype suggesting clindamycin resistance is inducible or erm is non-functional in these isolates.

ten of the  <dig> erythromycin susceptible isolates were mef-positive, one was erm-positive, and five were dual-positive, signifying a loss of gene function in these isolates.

time series
macrolide resistance rates in our collection increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  then stabilized through  <dig> .

dual-positive numbers grew steadily over the 10-year duration of the study from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of all macrolide resistant isolates. concurrently, the proportion mef-positive fell  and the proportion of erm-positive remained relatively steady until 2007- <dig> .

according to mlst and serotype deduction, strain dominance and diversity changed for all three populations over the  <dig> years . the most prevalent sequence types of the early dual-positive population include st <dig> and various single locus variants  that all belong to clonal complex   <dig>  through  <dig>  all isolates  in this population except the two st <dig> isolates serotyped as  <dig> f, a vaccine type . st <dig>  a slv of st <dig>  became dominant in our collection more recently, and almost exclusively by  <dig>  of the  <dig> st <dig> isolates serotyped, all were found to be a non-vaccine type  serotype 19a. this is consistent with the well-documented serotype switch in s. pneumoniae isolates in the u.s.  <cit> .

sequence types and serotypes of the mef-positive population remained diverse over the time period . out of  <dig> total sequence types identified in this population, only six were found in more than one two-year period, three of those in both pre- and post-vaccine introduction time periods. these include st <dig>  serotype  <dig> f, the genotype of the highly dispersed taiwan19f- <dig> clone and likely ancestor to the cc <dig> lineages, st <dig> of nvt 6a, and st <dig>  the genotype of the spain9v- <dig> clone in which serotype switching from vt  <dig> v to nvt 19a has been documented  <cit> . interestingly, in the pre-vaccination time period, the st <dig> strain is serotype 6a while the strain from the post-vaccination time period likely is  <dig> v.  the former was isolated from a  <dig> year-old male who may have received the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine  intended for adults over  <dig> years old and high-risk groups, and which covers serotype  <dig> v. this strain may have switched from  <dig> v to 6a in response to ppsv, before introduction of pcv <dig>  additionally, the mef-positive population illustrates serotype replacement. historically vt strains caused most pneumococcal disease, however after  <dig>  more nvt strains than vt strains were found.

in the erm-positive population, serotype replacement may also be evident. the early population is comprised of two st <dig>  vt 6b strains and a st <dig> strain, possibly vt  <dig> c.  they were replaced in later years by the unrelated st <dig>  nvt 15a or  <dig> f  and st <dig>  nvt  <dig> .

mef and erm population characteristics: specimen types
many  of the dual mef/erm-positive isolates were from ear specimens collected after  <dig>  from children of vaccine age . many  were from respiratory specimens, only eight of which came from children of vaccine age; most came from adults post-pcv <dig>  similarly, a relatively large proportion of isolates of the erm-positive population was from ear  or eye  specimens from children of vaccine age, while most of the rest are from adult patients. in contrast, the mef-positive population consists mostly of respiratory isolates , and a large fraction of these  are from older generations. a relatively small proportion was from ear specimens  or eye specimens  of children of vaccine age.

mef and erm population characteristics: mlst, antimicrobial resistance, transposon carriage
analyses of genotypes of dual-positive isolates showed little diversity within the population; seven of the  <dig> dual mef/erm-positive isolates are st <dig> and the remaining are slvs of st <dig> . all  <dig> of the dual-positive isolates are multidrug-resistant. most are resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and positive for tet; five were reported clindamycin-susceptible. thirty-three dual-positive isolates representing all sequence types found were analyzed for transposon carriage. all  <dig> were positive for the genes int and xis, and with primer sets sg1/ltf and eb2/tn <dig>  and negative for the genes tnpr and tnpa, indicating carriage of tn <dig>  the transposon known to harbor erm, mef, and tet . none apparently carried tn <dig>  although the dual positive population is the largest, it exhibits the lowest diversity of genotypes.

the erm-positive population is comprised of strains of four distinct sequence types, none of which match any from the dual-positive population . only one mlst allele is common to both populations. despite mlst dissimilarity among the erm-positive isolates, all have similar antibiotic susceptibility profiles. most are intermediately or fully susceptible to penicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole while resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, and all carry tet. out of the  <dig> isolates in this population, all eight st <dig> isolates were negative for int, xis, tnpr, and tnpa; the genetic context of their antibiotic resistance genes remains unknown. two isolates, one st <dig> and a non-typed isolate, tested positive for tn <dig> and tn <dig>  and produced an  <dig> bp pcr product with j12/j <dig> primers, signifying the presence of tn <dig>  the two st <dig> isolates and the st <dig> isolate tested positive for tn <dig>  but were negative for tn <dig> and with j12/j <dig>  possibly indicating carriage of tet in tn <dig> and a separate erm element .

genotype analyses of the mef-positive population show high diversity with relatively even distribution. besides three sets of slvs, the highest number of mlst alleles shared by any two sequence types is three, and no more than four isolates of the same sequence type were identified. many different antibiotic susceptibility profiles were identified in this population, with no single dominant profile. of the  <dig> mef-positive isolates, eight isolates of three sequence types, st <dig>  a slv of st <dig>  and st <dig>  were positive for int and xis, for the sg1/ltf region, and for tet, indicating the presence of tn <dig>  five others were positive for only int and xis and tet, indicating carriage of tn <dig> and a separate mega element. the absence of these transposon pcr targets and tet in the other  <dig> isolates suggests they are carrying the mega element .

discussion
macrolide resistance rates in clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae vary greatly among countries. the rate in our collection of isolates from arizona patients,  <dig> %, is consistent with other studies targeting s. pneumoniae in north america  <cit> .

the temporal trend in mef and erm prevalence that we observed in our collection, the rise in proportion dual gene-positive inversely to the proportion mef-positive, is similar to those of other non-invasive isolate studies  <cit> . recent studies of invasive isolates have shown low rates of dual gene carriage and multidrug resistance  <cit> . likewise, only one of the invasive isolates we tested was dual-gene positive. these significant differences between invasive and non-invasive isolate gene carriage and susceptibility profiles may arise because macrolide-induced selection pressures on invasive s. pneumoniae may be different from those on non-invasive s. pneumoniae, due to the pharmacodynamics of macrolide antibiotics.

over half of our macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae isolates are positive for both erm and mef. all these dual-positive strains belong to cc <dig>  have almost identical multidrug resistance profiles, and are likely carrying tn <dig>  clonal lineages of multidrug-resistant s. pneumoniae belonging to cc <dig> are now distributed worldwide and make up a significant portion of the macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in many regions  <cit> . the emergence of these clones is at least partly a response to introduction of pcv <dig>  in which lineages of the successful multidrug resistant taiwan19f- <dig> st <dig> clone acquired erm and switched serotypes in response to the selective pressures of an immunized population  <cit> . one cosmopolitan lineage recombined into st <dig> and serotype 19a  <cit> . this clone has afflicted arizona children since the pcv <dig> release in 2000; of the  <dig> dual-positive isolates in our collection,  <dig> are st <dig>   <dig> of which are from children of vaccine age. most of these are from ear and respiratory specimens, an observation consistent with that of the global protekt studies  <cit> . these data display the opportunistic dominance of a few s. pneumoniae clones in the post-pcv <dig> era. the pervasiveness of the multidrug resistant phenotype poses a serious public health concern for increased treatment failure and selection of these clones with the usage of any one of several antibiotics.

genotyping our collection revealed high strain diversity within the mef-positive population. the variety of antibiotic susceptibility profiles and mobile genetic elements carrying mef reflect the sequence type and serotype diversity found in this population. these data indicate that mef-carrying s. pneumoniae are the ancestral macrolide-resistant strains in the u.s. serotype replacement and a possible serotype switching event are evident in this population; nvts outnumber vts in later time periods, and st <dig>  the identifier of the spain9v- <dig> clone, typed as nvt 6a. one notable observation of the mef-positive population is that the latest st <dig> seen is 2005- <dig>  more evidence that this clone acquired the erm gene, and its lineages now comprise the dual mef/erm-positive population.

genotype analyses of the small erm-positive population illustrate serotype replacement. st <dig>  vt 6b is not seen after  <dig>  while st <dig>  nvt 15a became dominant  <cit> . these findings could be the result of loss in st <dig> or acquisition in st <dig> of erm and consequent sampling bias, however neither strain carries erm in a tn917-family transposon leaving the mobility of the erm element in these strains unknown.

the dramatic increase in erm-carrying s. pneumoniae isolates is important in regions where mef-carrying isolates have historically predominated. treatment with macrolides is an option for patients suffering localized infections caused by mef-carrying s. pneumoniae, as drug concentrations in tissues can supercede these bacteria's macrolide mics  <cit> . however, macrolide mics for erm-carrying strains are significantly higher than those of mef-carrying isolates  <cit> , increasing the need for alternative antibiotics where erm predominates. it remains to be seen whether the u.s. will see an increase in clinical failure in macrolide-treated cases parallel to the increase in erm-carrying s. pneumoniae.

CONCLUSIONS
our arizona-based study supports other global studies that illustrate the impact that pcv <dig> has had on the population structure of macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae in non-invasive isolates, and calls attention to the longevity of the success of particular multidrug resistant clones. the vaccine has reduced morbidity and mortality and multidrug resistance in invasive disease, but serotype replacement and serotype switching by s. pneumoniae has eclipsed these effects in non-invasive disease, and may soon for invasive disease  <cit> . however, the recently released pcv <dig>  which covers serotypes of the newly dominant multidrug-resistant clones, including 19a, may have very different consequences for s. pneumoniae population genetics. vaccine response and population genetics studies are important to our understanding of s. pneumoniae evolution and strain dominance. more accessible higher resolution technology, for example whole genome sequencing, provides us with more information than mlst, resistance gene profiling, targeted transposon investigation, and serotyping combined  <cit> . consequently, future studies that include next generation sequencing would help to better and more quickly elucidate the effects of s. pneumoniae infection prevention and treatment strategies.
