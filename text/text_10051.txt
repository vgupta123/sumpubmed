BACKGROUND
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome  is a rare inherited disorder characterized by autoimmune manifestations that predominantly involve blood cells, polyclonal accumulation of lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes with lymphoadenomegaly and/or splenomegaly, expansion of tcrαβ+ cd4/cd <dig> double-negative  t cells in the peripheral blood and defective in vitro apoptosis of mature lymphocytes induced by the fas death receptor  <cit> . individuals with alps also have an elevated incidence of several types of lymphoma  <cit> .

fas belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor  superfamily and induces cell death upon triggering by fasl  <cit> . it is highly expressed by activated effector lymphocytes in the immune response and switches it off by limiting clonal expansion of lymphocytes and favoring peripheral tolerance. fas signaling starts from aggregation of fas, the adaptor molecule fadd , and caspase- <dig> forming the death inducing signaling complex  which triggers caspase- <dig> activation and induces cell apoptosis through two partly interconnected pathways; the extrinsic pathway involves caspase-8-mediated direct activation of the cascade, whereas the intrinsic pathway proceeds through mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase- <dig>  both pathways converge in the activation of effector caspases, such as caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  in humans, but not in mice, the extrinsic pathway also involves caspase- <dig>  that is recruited into the disc and cooperates with caspase- <dig> in activation of the caspase cascade  <cit> .

alps is generally due to deleterious mutations of the fas gene  and is classified as alps type-ia   <cit> . other mutations, namely of the fasl gene in alps-ib  <cit> , and the caspase- <dig> gene  in alps-ii  <cit> , are occasionally detected, whereas some patients do not present any known mutations  <cit> . recently, mutations of the nras gene have been suggested to cause a further type of alps   <cit> . alps does not behave as a classical monogenic disease. most alps type-ia patients are heterozygous for the fas mutation, but the parent carrying the mutation is generally healthy. other complementary factors may thus be required in function of the severity of the mutation  <cit> . one possibility is that mild fas mutations only induces alps when cooperate with mutations of other genes impairing function of the fas system itself or other systems involved in similar functions. in line with this possibility, we have described osteopontin and perforin gene variations that predispose to alps  <cit> . the osteopontin gene variation correlated with production of increased amounts of this cytokine, which is involved in inflammation and also inhibits activation-induced cell death. the perforin gene variations were associated with decreased function of cytotoxic cells, which may switch off the immune response by fratricide of effector lymphocytes.

this work describes two unrelated patients that are double heterozygous for mutations of the fas and the caspase- <dig> gene. since the two mutations were inherited from distinct healthy parents, their co-transmission probably resulted in alps.

RESULTS
analysis of tnfrsf <dig> and casp10
pt. <dig> showed a heterozygous nucleotide substitution in tnfrsf <dig>  located in the splicing-acceptor site in the third intron and determining the ivs3-2a>g splice site defect. the mutation results in skipping of exon  <dig>  coding for an extracellular cysteine-rich domain, frameshift and premature termination after  <dig> codons. the mutated allele produces no protein. this mutation had already been described in a homozygous alps patient, whose heterozygous parents were healthy  <cit> .

sequencing of casp <dig> detected a c>t substitution at nt <dig> in exon  <dig>  resulting in a proline to leucine change  in the small catalytic subunit of caspase. the mutation, not previously described, was not detected in  <dig> healthy donors nor in  <dig> other alps patients. family analysis showed that the casp <dig> mutation was inherited from the apparently healthy mother, who did not carry the tnfrsf <dig> mutation. this was presumably inherited from the father, who was not available for analysis, or was a de novo mutation.

pt. <dig> carried a heterozygous c>t substitution at nt <dig> in tnfrsf <dig>  it was located in exon  <dig> coding for an extracellular domain and created a premature stop codon . the mutation was predicted to cause haploinsufficiency due to nonsense mediated decay of the aberrant mrna; alternatively, a truncated soluble fas fragment might be produced. sequencing of casp <dig> detected a heterozygous nucleotide substitution  in exon  <dig> causing the y446c amino acid change in the predicted protease domain of the small subunit. this variation has been previously associated to alps, but has been reported also in the healty caucasian population with allelic frequency ranging from  <dig>  to 2%  <cit> . family analysis showed that the fas mutation was inherited from the apparently healthy mother; the casp <dig> variation was possibly inherited from the father, who was not available for the study.

the pedigrees of these families are shown in the figure  <dig> 

functional analysis of the mutations
analysis of fas function in pha-activated t cells from the patients and their mothers showed that it was defective in pt. <dig> and borderline in pt. <dig> since cell survival upon triggering of fas was 92% in the former and 78% in the latter . moreover, fas function was borderline in both mothers since cell survival was 80% in the pt.1's mother and 78% in the pt. <dig> mother .

to asses whether the ivs3-2a>g and q47x tnfrsf <dig> mutations affected fas expression, activated t cells from pt. <dig> and pt. <dig> were stained by direct immunofluorescence with an anti-fas mab and analyzed by flow cytometry. results showed that both patients displayed decreased fas expression .

to assess whether the p501l and y446c caspase- <dig> amino acid substitutions affected the enzyme function, we evaluated caspase- <dig> activity induced by triggering of fas with anti-fas mab in activated t cells from available mutated subjects, i.e. pt. <dig>  his mother, and pt. <dig>  all subjects showed a caspase- <dig> activity that was lower than that of the controls . these data suggest that both substitution decrease caspase- <dig> activity. data on y446c are in line with those previously reported  <cit>  showing that the cloned y446c-caspase- <dig> is less effective than the wild type form in restoring fas-mediated apoptosis in cells lacking endogenous caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  but does not exert dominant negative activity on the wild type.

to further assess the activity of the novel p501l-caspase- <dig>  the cdnas coding for it or the wild-type protein  were cloned into the pcdna <dig>  myc-his vector, fused to ha- or flag-tag sequences respectively . both were transiently transfected into 293t cells, expressing minimal levels of endogenous caspase- <dig>  moreover, 293t cells were cotrasfected with the p501lha and wtflag plasmids to determine whether the mutated form exterted a dominant negative activity on the wild type form. western blot analysis showed that both constructs were expressed at comparable levels in all trasfectants and both proteins were spontaneously cleaved, the mutated form even more efficiently than the wild type form . however, analysis of the caspase- <dig> enzyme activity on the lysates by a fluorimetric assay showed that the p501l-caspase- <dig> displayed about 50% of the activity displayed by the wild type. cells cotransfected with the p501lha and wtflag plasmids showed levels of caspase- <dig> activity intermediate between those of cells transfected with each plasmid alone, which indicates that the mutated form does not exert a dominant negative activity on the wild type.

discussion
this work reports that mutations of tnfrsf <dig>  characterizing alps type ia, and casp <dig>  characterizing alps type ii, can cooperate in the development of alps.

fas mutations are the most frequent in alps. usually heterozygous, their penetrance depends on their effect on fas function. mutations hitting the intracellular death domain of fas, involved in recruitment of fadd and caspase- <dig> and initiating the death signal, are often the most severe. they exert a dominant-negative effect and display high penetrance. by contrast, mutations hitting the extracellular portion or causing haploinsufficiency have weaker penetrance  <cit> .

both our patients carried mutations predicted to cause haploinsufficiency. in line with this prediction, t cells from both pt. <dig> and pt. <dig> expressed low levels of fas. penetrance of these mutations is presumably weak. this is suggested for the nonsense q47x mutation by the lack of any sign of alps in the pt.2's carrier mother. by contrast, the absence of pt.1's father meant that clinical effect of ivs3-2a>g splice site defect could not be determined by a pedigree analysis, since it might have been a de novo mutation. however, this mutation has been previously described in a different family, where its heterozigosity was not sufficient to cause alps  <cit> .

only two casp <dig> mutations have so far been unequivocally involved in alps. they are the missense mutations causing the l285f and i406l amino acid substitutions detected in  <dig> and  <dig> heterozygous patients respectively. both mutations decreased caspase- <dig> activity and exerted a dominant negative effect on the wild type protein, but neither was sufficient to induce the overt disease, since several mutated familial components were healthy, and some displayed serum autoantibodies only  <cit> .

both casp <dig> mutations carried by our patients are mild heterozygous missense mutations decreasing caspase- <dig> activity without exerting a dominant negative effect on the wild type protein. it is therefore intriguing that these patients also displayed mild fas mutations that were presumably required to worsen the apoptotic defect and cause alps development. pt. <dig> carried the y446c mutation, previously reported in one heterozygous patient displaying a mild form of alps  <cit> . this mutation decreased caspase- <dig> function, without inducing a dominant negative effect on the wild type protein. the mutation is not sufficient to induce alps since it is also detected in 1–2% of the healthy caucasian population  <cit> . pt. <dig> carried the novel p501l mutation, located, like y466c, in the small subunit of caspase- <dig>  p501l, too, decreased caspase- <dig> function without inducing a dominant negative effect on the wild type protein. decreased activity was clearly detected in lymphocytes from both this patient, who also carried the fas mutation, and his mother, who only carried the casp <dig> mutation. moreover, 293t cells transfected with the mutated form displayed about 50% of the enzyme activity displayed by the wild type. lack of negative dominance was shown when cotransfection with both the mutated and the wild type forms produced an additive and not an antagonistic effect on caspase- <dig> enzyme activity. it is noteworthy that western blot analysis of transfected cells showed that p501l did not affect cleavage of caspase- <dig>  which is often interpreted as an evidence of activation. however, the decreased activity detected by the in vitro caspase- <dig> enzyme assay supports the model proposed by boatright et al. that cleavage is neither sufficient or necessary for activation of initiator caspases, that mainly depends on dimerization  <cit> .

the effect of the interaction between these fas and caspase- <dig> mutations seems opposite to those reported for interactions between fas mutations and caspase- <dig> missense variation v410i  <cit> . this variation was initially posited as a cause of alps since it had been detected in one homozygous patient. it has since been found as an "innocent" polymorphism carried by 3–5% of the caucasian population  <cit> . an association analysis, indeed, suggested that it gave protection against severe alps in  <dig> families with alps-ia caused by severe dominant mutations of fas  <cit> . it is intriguing that the first alps patient homozygous for v410i harbored a heterozygous missense mutation in the tumor necrosis factor receptor- <dig> gene , which is mutated in the tnf receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome  and may explain its clinical pattern  <cit> . this suggests that the caspase- <dig> variation also influenced the clinical phenotype due to the tnfrsf1a mutation.

CONCLUSIONS
this work suggests that alps may sometimes be caused by the concurrent effect of mutations hitting different genes involved in fas function and hence that it may be both a classic monogenic disease, as occurs in the presence of severe mutations hitting the intracellular portion of fas, and the outcome of digenic or even oligogenic mutations affecting different steps of the fas signalling pathway.
