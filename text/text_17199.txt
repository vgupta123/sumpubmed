BACKGROUND
in most eukaryotic cells the centrosome, composed of centrioles and associated pericentriolar material , acts as a major microtubule organizing center  participating in the organization of both the interphase cytoskeleton and the mitotic spindle. in addition, the centriole component of the centrosome can function as a basal body that organizes the formation of a cilium while in many cases the associated pcm continues to operate as a cytoplasmic mtoc. this cilium can be one of two types, a motile cilium with a 9+ <dig> arrangement of microtubules or non-motile  cilia with 9+ <dig> arrangement of microtubules . most vertebrate cells contain a single non-motile primary cilium that is assembled in a step-wise manner from the distal end of a mature centriole within the centrosome. we have previously shown that primary ciliogenesis in cultured human astrocytes and synoviocytes proceeds through stages beginning with the formation of a membrane bound vesicle at the distal end of the basal body  followed by the establishment and growth of a 9+ <dig> ciliary axoneme  <cit> . although long ignored, the primary cilium has recently been the focus of intense investigation. these efforts have established that the primary cilium is a key coordinator for a variety of signaling pathways that function in development and tissue homeostasis. importantly, defects associated with the primary cilium underlie a variety of human diseases and developmental disorders including alstr√∂m, bardet-biedl, joubert, meckel-gruber and oral-facial-digital type  <dig> syndromes where common clinical phenotypes include obesity, ataxia and mental retardation, suggesting that primary cilia are required for the proper development and particularly function in the brain  <cit> .

proteins involved in cell cycle progression are also linked to primary cilium expression  and may play a role in tumor formation as reported in two recent studies  <cit> . further, defects in early stages of ciliogenesis were reported as a common feature in astrocytoma/glioblastoma cells including highly malignant t98g glioblastoma multiforme cells which expressed abnormally long centrioles and no primary cilia as evidenced by ultrastructure analysis  <cit> . to date, numerous cilia or basal body-associated proteins have been discovered by proteomic, comparative genomic and bioinformatic studies, representing the so-called "ciliome"  <cit> . a recent functional genomics screen has identified potential modulators of ciliogenesis in telomerase-immortalized human retinal pigmented epithelial cells, however the molecules and/or pathways that regulate ciliogenesis remain to be identified.

centrioles/basal bodies and the primary cilium region are associated with a variety of cellular organelles  and endocytosis signaling pathways in a cell cycle specific manner, which frequently is dependent upon a functional interdependence between the centrosome/basal body and these organelles  <cit> . recently, a real time microscopy study by aizer et al. documented that a pair of stationary gw/p bodies reside at the centrosome in human u2os  interphase cells, a feature that is markedly different from the majority of cytoplasmic gw/p bodies that are mobile and can transit rapidly along microtubule tracks to and from the centrosome  <cit> .

gw/p bodies are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules that contain messenger rna , microrna  and proteins involved in mrna transport, stabilization, silencing and/or degradation . key gw/p body constituent proteins, gw <dig> and hago <dig>  are cytoplasmic effector proteins of the rna silencing pathway that bind mirna to silence and degrade mrna  <cit> . the observation by aizer et al. that two stationary gw/p bodies reside at the centrosome in human malignant cells  <cit>  raises the possibility that mirna could potentially be located at the centrosome in gw/p bodies and may play a role in posttranscriptional regulation of mrna involved in centrosome functions including primary ciliogenesis. the idea that rna may be present at the centrosome is not entirely new and is consistent with reports showing that rna is a component of the centrosome in the mollusc ilyanassa obsoleta and in the surf clam   <cit>  which leads us to hypothesize that gw/p bodies and the mirna pathway may play a yet-to-be-determined role in centrosome function such as the expression of a primary cilium. the goal of this study was to determine if stationary gw/p bodies are also present at the centrosome of non-malignant cells particularly those capable of expressing a primary cilium and to determine if the inhibition of the mirna pathway impairs cilium formation.

RESULTS
two gw/p bodies localize to the centrosome/basal body in cultured human astrocytes and synoviocytes
in a previous study we investigated the expression of primary cilia in both normal primary astrocytes and human synoviocytes  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that in both cell types ciliogenesis is characterized by a series of morphological stages including an early stage during which the basal body is associated with a vesicle at the distal end  and subsequent stages  that show various degrees of ciliary axoneme development  <cit> . unlike kidney primary cilia where the mature axoneme extends completely free of the plasma membrane, the proximal portion of the primary cilium in these two cell types is contained within a membrane channel contiguous with the plasma membrane  that is integrated with the centrosome/basal body region via microtubules, is associated with golgi complexes and is a major site of endocytosis  <cit> .

to confirm and extend the report by aizer et al.  <cit>  we examined the position of gw/p bodies relative to the centrosome in interphase primary human astrocytes and synoviocytes. since results were identical for both astrocytes and synoviocytes, here we only report the data obtained from the primary human astrocytes. indirect immunofluorescence  analysis in over  <dig> interphase cells showed that, in addition to abundant gw/p bodies in the cytoplasm, gw/p body foci localize to the centrosome in 100% of cells that were maintained in a log phase culture, a frequency that is consistent with gw/p bodies being components of the centrosome  <cit> . figure 1a illustrates the colocalization of gw/p bodies with the centrosome in daughter cells in early g <dig> phase, a late g1/s phase cell expressing a primary cilium and a late s/g <dig> cell displaying prominent chromatin condensation. figure 1b shows in greater detail two gw/p bodies positioned at the centrosome and at the basal body during the expression of a primary cilium. these two foci were also highlighted by mouse monoclonal antibodies to the gw/p body component hago <dig> . interestingly, hago <dig> also localized to the proximal portion of the shaft of the primary cilium . these iif experiments were replicated using anti-glutamylated  tubulin as an alternate marker of primary cilia . it is important to note that a large number of gw/p bodies  are characteristic of primary human astrocytes . the number of gw/p bodies observed in these cells differs greatly from those in malignant cells  and seemingly correlates with their extensive cytoplasmic area. further, the number of gw/p bodies elicited by iif staining did not differ when gw/p bodies are over-expressed using gw <dig> gfp-cdna .

immunogold electron microscopy confirmed that gw/p body foci, as marked by prototype gw <dig> human antiserum  <dig>  localized to the centrosome and further clarified that they are commonly found at the distal end of the centriole in the pericentriolar region as shown in longitudinal and transverse sections . taken together with previously published reports  <cit> , these data suggest that two gw/p bodies are constitutive components of the centrosome during interphase including periods of primary cilium expression.

repression of gw <dig>  hago <dig>  drosha and dgcr <dig> with sirna inhibits the formation of mature primary cilia in human astrocytes
we next investigated the effect of the inhibition of the mirna pathway on cilia formation targeting the general gw/p body population since it is technically challenging to specifically target the two centrosomal gw/p bodies. human astrocytes were transfected with  <dig> nm of sirna directed to gw <dig> and hago <dig> as well as scrambled non-targeting sirna and lipofectamine only  for  <dig> and  <dig> hours. non-treated control and sirna-treated astrocytes were fixed and examined by iif for primary cilia expression using antibodies directed against glu tubulin . the specificity of the knockdown was monitored using mouse monoclonal 4b <dig> to gw <dig>  and mouse monoclonal 4f <dig> to hago <dig>  . in the no sirna/lipofectamine only and si-scrambled treatment conditions, mature primary cilia were observed  with two gw/p body foci as marked by gw <dig>  localized to the basal body  . after treatment with gw <dig> sirna, two centrioles per cell were still visible by conventional microscopy as marked by anti-glu tubulin, however primary cilia were completely absent . similarly, primary cilia were absent and only two centrioles per cell were visible as marked by anti-glu tubulin when astrocytes were treated with si-hago <dig> . the si-gw <dig> and si-hago <dig> transfected cells knocked down the expression of gw/p bodies and no green foci were present when stained using gw <dig> or hago <dig> mouse monoclonal antibodies by iif . these experiments were performed in triplicate and >  <dig> cells were counted for primary cilia expression under no treatment control, scrambled, no sirna/lipofectamine only, si-gw <dig> and si-hago <dig> conditions . quantitation of primary cilia examined by iif showed that ~18% of control astrocytes displayed a mature cilium and under si-scrambled and no sirna/lipofectamine only conditions, 16% and 17% of cells displayed a mature cilium respectively . by comparison, 0% of the cells displayed a mature cilium when treated with sirna to repress gw <dig> or hago <dig> expression at  <dig> hours  and  <dig> hours  post transfection. our results show that when gw/p bodies, including centrosome/basal body gw/p bodies, were repressed by cognate sirna to gw <dig> and hago <dig>  primary cilium formation was impacted.

to further examine the effect of our experimental manipulation, an electron microscopic  study was undertaken, which showed that control astrocytes had a centrosome/basal body -primary cilium with a morphology similar to that previously reported . however, after repression of gw <dig> and hago <dig> by cognate sirna, cells expressing a mature primary cilium were no longer detected although basal bodies displaying a morphology characteristic with the earliest stage of ciliogenesis  were observed  indicating that the inhibition of the mirna pathway impairs primary ciliogenesis at a specific point in its morphogenesis.

the truncation of ciliogenesis following the disruption of gw/p body components led us to question whether the expression of upstream nuclear components of the rna silencing pathway such as the microprocessor proteins drosha and dgcr <dig> would also affect ciliogenesis and thus support our initial observations. both light and electron microscopic analysis of primary astrocytes treated with drosha and dgcr <dig> sirna showed similar phenotypes to that observed with gw <dig> and hago <dig> knockdown experiments . western blot analysis confirmed that the expression of gw <dig>  hago <dig>  drosha and dgcr <dig> proteins were repressed after treatment with  <dig> nm of their respective cognate sirnas for  <dig> hours . the hago <dig> protein levels were decreased by ~60-70% after treatment with si-hago <dig> whereas gw <dig>  drosha and dgcr <dig> protein levels were decreased by ~85-95% after treatment with their cognate sirnas . western blot analysis of the scrambled non-targeting sirna/lipofectamine only and no treatment control lysates showed that the sirna repressive effects were specific . western blotting with anti-actin demonstrated that equal amounts of protein  were loaded in each treatment condition . the western blot analysis was repeated after  <dig> hours transfection with results identical to  <dig> hours transfection . taken together, the western blot results show that the cognate sirnas for gw <dig>  hago <dig>  drosha and dgcr <dig> knocked down the expression of their intended target with considerable efficiency and had no observable off-target repressive effects. the western blot data confirms our iif results.

finally, since ciliogenesis is tightly correlated with cell cycle progression and primary cilia are expressed predominantly during late g1/s, we performed a series of experiments to investigate the possibility that sirna transfection was disrupting the cell cycle and hence ciliogenesis. primary human astrocytes under control and sirna transfection conditions were fixed and examined by flow cytometry following the addition of propidium iodide . astrocytes with no sirna treatment and no sirna/lipofectamine had 88% and 83% of the cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, respectively . similarly, astrocytes treated with scrambled non-targeting sirna had 77% of cells in g <dig> phase . astrocytes treated with sirnas to gw <dig>  hago <dig>  drosha and dgcr <dig> had 78%, 71%, 73% and 73% of the cells in the g <dig> phase respectively , which was similar to results obtained from control samples. the results at  <dig> hours transfection were the same after  <dig> hours transfection . these observations indicate that sirna transfection does not change the cell cycle profile of human astrocytes to an extent that would elicit a decrease in primary cilia expression or impact the interpretation of our transfection data.

one drawback of our study is that current techniques do not allow us to specifically target the two gw/p bodies that reside at the centrosome and targeting the general gw/p body population with its possible secondary effects makes it difficult to draw a clear direct functional link between centrosomal gw/p bodies and centrosome functions such as cilium formation. we are currently attempting to address this issue using alternative experimental approaches. we examined gw/p body specific mirna normalized to total cellular mirna in human astrocytes and found that ten different mirnas were differentially expressed in gw/p bodies as compared to the total cellular mirna fraction and are predicted using ingenuity pathway analysis software  to regulate mrna involved in primary ciliogenesis. six mirna rna-immunoprecipitated in gw/p bodies were predicted to regulate kif3a  and include mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  three mirna rna-immunoprecipitated in gw/p bodies were predicted to regulate vhl  and include mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> and one mirna rna-immunoprecipitated in gw/p bodies was predicted to regulate odf <dig> , kif3aand vhl and include mir- <dig>  all three of these mrna are involved in the formation and assembly of primary cilia  <cit> . our preliminary results indicate that gw/p bodies contain mirna that could potentially regulate mrna critical for primary ciliogenesis  thus raising the possibility that centrosome gw/p bodies are required for centrosome/basal body functions, opening a new area of investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the real time imaging results of aizer et al.  <cit>  indicated that a population of gw/p bodies were resident at the centrosome of u2os cells. this observation raised the question as to whether this relationship is also found in other cell types and if so if the inhibition of the mirna pathway impairs centrosome based functions. our study confirms and extends the observation of aizer and co-workers indicating that there is a population of centrosome based gw/p bodies in diverse non-malignant cell types. further, we document that the inhibition of the mirna pathway impairs ciliogenesis halting it at a stage prior to the initiation of axoneme formation.
