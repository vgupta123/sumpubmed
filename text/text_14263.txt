BACKGROUND
viruses and other pathogens express a variety of proteins interfering with the host immune responses to counteract immune surveillance and increase their virulence  <cit> . the ability of a pathogen to modulate host response to infection and the reaction of host cells to such immunomodulation form an environment that can influence concurrent or subsequent infections by other pathogens  <cit> . a significant role in this immunomodulation is played by the cytokine-chemokine network  <cit> . for example, infection with mouse lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus abolishes replication of the hepatitis b virus, and this process is mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ  <cit> . co-infection of human lymphoid tissue ex vivo with human herpesvirus  <dig> and ccr5-utilizing hiv- <dig> results in suppression of hiv infection, a process dependent on herpesvirus 6-mediated upregulation of cc chemokine regulated upon activation in normal t cells expressed and secreted , a natural ligand for ccr <dig>  <cit> . upregulation of chemokines was also implicated as a primary mechanism of hiv- <dig> suppression caused by at least two other pathogens – measles  <cit>  and gb virus c   <cit> . similar to co-infections, immunizations, especially with live vaccines, can change the immune environment and cytokine profile and may have unexpected effects on subsequent infection with an unrelated pathogen.

RESULTS
to test whether immunizations have a long-term effect on cytokine profile, we measured, using luminex technology, concentrations of a number of immunomodulatory cytokines in serum samples from six members of the us military. these individuals received multiple immunizations including vaccines against smallpox , anthrax, typhoid, rabies, and influenza during the  <dig> month period preceding the blood donation . ten non-military subjects immunized with another live vaccine, against the yellow fever virus , and  <dig> non-vaccinated individuals of matching sex and age served as controls. the time between the last vaccination and blood donation for military personnel ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks . blood from subjects immunized with the yf vaccine was collected 16– <dig> weeks after vaccination, to allow development of anti-yf immune response  <cit>  and to match experimental group. importantly, subjects in this group did not receive any other vaccine within a period of  <dig> weeks prior to yf vaccination. significantly elevated  levels of ccl <dig> , ccl <dig>  and cxcl <dig>  were found in serum samples from vaccinated military personnel, but not in recipients of vaccine against yellow fever. these results were then verified using elisa . no other factor tested, including ccl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , il-1α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  cxcl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , interferon gamma , and tumor necrosis factor α  varied significantly between multiply vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated subjects.

*donor # <dig> was immunized once against smallpox, once against anthrax, once against typhoid, three times against rabies and once against influenza within  <dig> weeks prior to blood donation 

nd – no data available; ni – not immunized.

mip-1α and mip-1β are ligands for the ccr <dig> receptor  <cit> , while il- <dig> has been shown to induce ccr <dig> internalization  <cit> . since ccr <dig> is a co-receptor for the majority of transmitted hiv- <dig> strains  <cit> , the observed cytokine profile could provide resistance to hiv- <dig> infection through interference with virus interaction with ccr <dig>  to test this supposition, we analyzed the effect of sera from vaccinated and control subjects on replication of r <dig> and x <dig> hiv- <dig> in pbmcs from unvaccinated control donors. pbmcs from  <dig> different donors were cultured without external activation for  <dig> days to allow physiological monocyte-dependent activation of t cells and then infected with hiv-1ada  or hiv-1lai  adjusted according to reverse transcriptase activity. serum from vaccinated military personnel, but not unvaccinated control subjects, provided partial protection of pbmcs against infection with r <dig>  but not x <dig>  hiv- <dig> . this result is consistent with previously reported anti-r <dig> activity of mip-1α and mip-1β at concentrations found in the sera of vaccinated subjects  <cit> . nevertheless, the possibility remains that some additional soluble factors could also contribute to the observed protection. interestingly, conflicting reports have been published regarding the effect of cc chemokines on replication of x <dig> hiv- <dig> strains, with one group reporting enhancement of x <dig> hiv- <dig> replication  <cit> , whereas the other not confirming this effect  <cit> . we did not observe an enhancement of replication of hiv-1lai by sera from multiply vaccinated subjects, consistent with the report by cocchi and colleagues  <cit> .

we next tested susceptibility of pbmcs from vaccinated military personnel to hiv- <dig> infection in vitro. similar to the previous experiment, cells were cultured for  <dig> days without any exogenous activating factor, and then were infected with r <dig> , x <dig> , or dual-tropic   strain of hiv- <dig>  results presented in figure  <dig> demonstrate that replication of the r <dig> viruses was significantly suppressed in pbmc cultures derived from military personnel compared to cultures from unvaccinated control subjects. this difference became even more pronounced when autologous serum was present during the in vitro infection , consistent with the presence in these serum samples of chemokines with ccr5-specific anti-hiv activity . no significant differences between cells from vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects were observed in infections with x <dig> or x4r <dig> strains of hiv- <dig> . also, neither r <dig> nor x <dig> strains were suppressed in cells from yfv-immunized subjects . the protective effect against r <dig> hiv- <dig> strains was lost when the infected cultures were activated with phytohemagglutinin , suggesting that strong activation may overcome the protective effect of immunization. surprisingly, analysis of ccr <dig> expression on cd <dig> positive cells from multiply vaccinated and control subjects did not reveal significant differences . this result, however, does not rule out the possibility that the functional activity of ccr <dig> as an hiv receptor may be impaired. further studies will be required to investigate the mechanisms of this interesting observation.

vaccine against smallpox was the only vaccine received by all the military personnel involved in this study within past  <dig> months, whereas all other immunizations varied between the subjects. that and the fact that subject  <dig> did not get any other immunization but vaccinia , yet his serum showed the same chemokine profile as serum from other subjects of this group , suggests that vaccinia virus may be responsible for the observed effect. however, the effect of another immunization received in the more distant past cannot be excluded at the present time. the observed protection is unlikely to be a non-specific effect of immunization with a live vaccine, since vaccination against yellow fever did not alter cytokine profile or affect sensitivity of recipient's pbmcs to either r <dig> or x <dig> hiv- <dig> . the uniformly very low levels of mip-1α, mip-1β and il- <dig> present in the serum of control subjects, which had broad racial diversity, suggests that racial bias  is unlikely to be responsible for the observed differences.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence that some strong immunogens, or their combination, can cause long-term change in serum chemokines and induce resistance of pbmcs to hiv- <dig> infection. despite precedence from veterinary medicine  <cit> , the observed long-term increase in cytokine levels induced by vaccination has, to our knowledge, never been reported in humans. further studies are necessary to determine which vaccine  is responsible for the protective effect against hiv- <dig>  but vaccinia is our favorite. our recent study on pbmcs from another group of military personnel who received vaccinia immunization demonstrated a similar restriction of replication of r <dig> hiv- <dig> strains, including a slight enhancement of suppression of r <dig> hiv- <dig> strains in the presence of autologous serum of multiply immunized individuals . the donors involved in our study were not tested for the presence of gbv-c. however, it appears unlikely that all multiply immunized subjects and none of the subjects in the control groups are gbv-c infected, arguing against the role of gbv-c infection in the observed phenomenon. nevertheless, such test should be included in any of the future studies devoted to this question. these results warrant a larger study of the effects of multiple immunizations including vaccinia. knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for such stimulation of innate immunity by conventional vaccines may be used to increase the efficiency of vaccines against hiv- <dig> and, if found to involve long-term activation of other aspects of innate immunity, could have an impact on immunization approaches.
