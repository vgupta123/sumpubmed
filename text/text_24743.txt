BACKGROUND
the mir <dig> family represents one of the most ancient mirna families being present in most land plants   <cit> . via bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation, mir <dig> has been found to regulate the expression of a family of gamyb or gamyb-like genes in a diverse range of plant species, including monocots such as barley and rice  <cit> , dicots such as arabidopsis  <cit> , potato  <cit>  and strawberry  <cit> , and gymnosperms such as larix  <cit> . despite the considerable evolutionary distance that separates these species, the mir <dig> binding site in these myb genes is conserved in both position and sequence, inferring this mir159-myb relationship has a long co-evolutionary history. this strong conservation indicates this mir159-myb relationship has been under strong selective pressure, presumably performing a critical function.

these gamyb genes encode r2r <dig> myb domain transcription factors that have been implicated in gibberellin  signal transduction. their role has been best characterised in anthers  and seeds , where a major role is to promote programmed cell death . in rice, a loss-of-function gamyb mutant is male sterile as the tapetum fails to undergo pcd and degenerate  <cit> . likewise in arabidopsis, mutation of myb <dig> and myb <dig>  the two major target genes of mir <dig>  results in male sterility due to a tapetum that fails to degenerate  <cit> . supporting these observations is the overexpression of mir <dig> in both cereals and arabidopsis which results in male sterility , implying this gamyb anther function has been strongly conserved. in the seed, gamyb expression in barley or arabidopsis promotes aleurone vacuolation, also a ga-mediated pcd process  <cit> . therefore, it appears that in seeds where mir <dig> activity is weak  <cit> , these gamyb-like genes are expressed, promoting a conserved pcd function.

by contrast, the functional role of the mir159-myb pathway in vegetative tissues is not as clear. a role for mir <dig> in development has been suggested from genetic analysis in arabidopsis. previously, loss-of-function mutations have been isolated for all three arabidopsis mir <dig> family members, mir159a-c. none of the three single mutants displayed a phenotype, but a mir159ab double mutant displayed pleiotropic developmental defects, that included stunted growth and rounded, upwardly curled leaves  <cit> . this was consistent with deep sequencing; mir159a and mir159b were found to be overwhelmingly the major isoforms, composing approximately 90 % and 10 % of the mir <dig> reads respectively in arabidopsis  <cit> . by contrast, mir159c is very lowly expressed, and there are multiple lines of evidence indicating this mirna is likely non-functional in arabidopsis  <cit> . although mir <dig> is predicted to regulate approximately  <dig> different target genes in arabidopsis, all the mir159ab pleiotropic vegetative defects are suppressed in a mir159ab.myb <dig> myb <dig> quadruple mutant, genetically demonstrating that mir <dig> is functionally specific for myb <dig> and myb <dig> in vegetative tissues, although this does not dismiss the possibility of mir159-mediated regulation of other targets that do not result in obvious developmental defects. nevertheless, partly explaining this specificity is that many of the other potential mir <dig> targets are not transcribed in vegetative tissues, but rather their transcription is restricted to anthers  <cit> . together, these experiments have defined a highly active mir159-myb33/myb <dig> pathway present in arabidopsis vegetative tissues.

curiously, rosettes of a myb <dig> myb <dig> double mutant have no major phenotypic defects, where multiple lines of evidence suggest that mir159-mediated silencing represses the expression of these genes to low levels  <cit> , raising the question of what functional role this pathway plays in rosettes. although a role for myb <dig> in promoting flowering has been proposed, as mir <dig> overexpression in the landsberg erecta ecotype reduced myb <dig> transcript levels and delayed flowering  <cit> , no such impact was seen in the columbia ecotype  <cit> . furthermore, flowering was neither delayed in myb <dig> myb <dig> nor promoted in mir159ab indicating myb33/myb <dig> are not major players in determining flowering-time in columbia  <cit> . therefore, no clear rationale exists for this mir159-myb33/myb <dig> pathway in rosette/vegetative tissues, at least under standard growing conditions.

interestingly, similar to many other highly conserved mirnas, numerous studies that have quantified changes to mirna levels have implicated mir <dig> in playing a response to a variety of stresses in a number of different species. this includes drought  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , cold  <cit> , heat  <cit> , uv-light  <cit> , waterlogging  <cit>  or response to biotic stresses such as viruses  <cit>  or bacterial lipopolysaccharides  <cit> . given myb activity can impact vegetative growth its expression may adjust growth during stress  <cit> . however, no clear trend in mir <dig> abundance emerges from these stress treatments, where in some instance mir <dig> abundance increases with stress treatment  <cit> , and in others, mir <dig> abundance decreases  <cit> . whether these changes result in significant physiological responses to these stresses and whether any potential role is widely conserved is unclear. therefore, despite the mir159-myb being strongly conserved across many species, what functional role this pathway plays in vegetative tissues remains unknown. to address this question, we have attempted to determine in what developmental stages of the rosette development are mir <dig> and myb33/ <dig> expressed/transcribed. we then investigate under what conditions mir <dig> is sufficiently suppressed enabling de-repression of myb33/ <dig> expression, and whether this alteration in mir <dig> contributes to a physiological response to the stress. such experiments will help determine what functional role the mir159-myb pathway performs in vegetative tissues of arabidopsis.

RESULTS
the mir159-myb33/ <dig> module is ubiquitously present in arabidopsis rosettes
to begin the characterisation of mir159-myb pathway in arabidopsis rosettes, two time-course experiments were performed to determine in what developmental stages and rosette tissues mir <dig> and myb33/ <dig> are expressed. firstly, a qrt-pcr based transcript profiling was performed on a time-course of arabidopsis rosettes grown over 60 days to determine the abundance of mature mir159a/mir159b and the mrna levels of myb33/myb <dig> . however, myb33/ <dig> mrna levels are not accurate indicators of their protein expression level due to the presence of a strong mir159-mediated translational repression mechanism  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether the mrna levels of a downstream gene, cysteine proteinase <dig>   <cit>  would be an accurate indicator of myb33/ <dig> activity. we found cp <dig> mrna levels tightly correlate with myb <dig> and myb <dig> mrna levels in the absence of mir <dig> . therefore, cp <dig> levels are used throughout the study as an indicator of myb33/myb <dig> activity.fig.  <dig> mir <dig> constitutively silences myb33/ <dig> throughout rosette development. a–c time-course transcript profiling of the mir159-myb pathway in rosettes. the relative mirna and mrna levels were measured in rosettes approximately every 10 days throughout its development. the mir <dig> levels were normalized to sno <dig>  the mrna levels were normalized to cyclophilin. values are the mean of three technical replicates with error bars representing the standard deviation . significant differences in values from the previous measurement are indicated with an *, as determined by the students t-test. d time-course gus-staining assay for rosettes of mir159b:gus and mmyb33:gus transgenic lines. staining was carried out on ten individual rosettes per time point, at ten-day interval during plant growth; only the first and last staining results are shown



it was found that both mir159a and mir159b were expressed throughout rosette development. both mirnas had similar developmental profiles, increasing approximately two-fold during the first half of rosette development and then decreasing slightly . although for mir159a, there were no significant differences in mirna levels at the different time points, independent time-courses confirmed this pattern and the approximate two-fold increase in mir159a abundance . for myb <dig> and myb <dig>  their transcript levels fluctuated throughout rosette development. however, their levels did not inversely correlate with the mir <dig> profile, and so these observed differences are likely to be independent of regulation by mir <dig> . additionally, these wild-type myb33/myb <dig> transcript levels are approximately 10-fold lower compared to levels in 35-day-old mir159ab rosettes , suggesting myb33/myb <dig> are being repressed throughout vegetative development. supporting this notion, mrna of the cp <dig> marker gene remains low throughout wild-type rosette development , as cp <dig> mrna in 35-day-old mir159ab rosettes is at least an order of magnitude higher . in mir159ab rosettes, the cp <dig> mrna abundance is similar to that of three-day-old wild-type seedlings, tissue that is known to have high myb protein activity due to weak mir <dig> activity in seeds  <cit> . based on all the above data, myb <dig> and myb <dig> mrna is likely being continually repressed throughout wild-type rosette development, and that the fluctuations observed in their transcript levels may not have any functional significance.

to determine in what rosette tissues mir <dig> and its target myb genes are transcribed, a β-glucuronidase -staining assay was carried out over a 60-day time course on two transgenic arabidopsis lines; mir159b:gus and mmyb33:gus. the mir159b:gus line was constructed by fusing the gus gene downstream of the mir159b promoter, to visualize the transcriptional domain of mir159b  <cit> , while the mmyb33:gus line carries a mir159-resistant version of myb <dig>  which enables visualization of the myb <dig> transcriptional domain  <cit> . the rosettes of each line were harvested and stained every ten days. it was found that the rosettes of both lines stained at all the tested time points, from young seedling  to the late reproductive  growth phases . moreover, the staining appeared ubiquitous throughout mir159b:gus and mmyb33:gus rosettes. patches of unstained cells in the older plants did not reflect a developmental pattern, but rather appeared to correspond to dead cells or a leaf staining penetration problem. hence, both mir159b and myb <dig> appear transcribed in all cells and at all rosette developmental stages. together, the data suggests the strong constitutive expression of mir <dig> that suppresses the expression of the constitutively transcribed myb <dig> and myb <dig> genes throughout arabidopsis rosette development.

mir <dig> is functionally active throughout rosette development
since 35s-mir <dig> arabidopsis plants have no obvious vegetative defects  <cit>  and mir <dig> appears to constantly silence myb <dig> and myb <dig> under normal growth conditions , a major impact of the mir159-myb pathway in the rosette only appears possible if mir <dig> levels can be decreased enabling myb33/myb <dig> expression. to test this idea, a xve-mim <dig> transgene was transformed into arabidopsis . xve is a transactivator that can be induced by estrogen , resulting in transcriptional activation of the downstream transgene  <cit> , while the mim <dig> gene carries a non-cleavable mir <dig> binding site that inhibits mir <dig> function  <cit> . primary xve-mim <dig> transformants were selected and grown for 21 days so that rosettes were well established, and were then treated with either 10 μm 17-β-estradiol  or dimethyl sulfoxide . after two weeks of 17-β-estradiol treatment, rosettes contained upwardly curled leaves . this occurred in the older leaves of the plant, consistent with the older leaves of mir159ab displaying the strongest curl. such phenotypes were not observed in xve-mim <dig> transformants treated with just dmso or in any wild-type plants grown under our conditions. additionally, myb <dig>  myb <dig> and cp <dig> mrna levels were elevated in 17-β-estradiol treated xve-mim <dig> plants . together, this data suggests that mir <dig> function is constantly active in developing rosettes and perturbation of this function results in de-repression of myb33/ <dig> expression accompanied with morphological alterations to the rosette. this raises the possibility that the mir159-myb module may be involved in response to environmental stress, where repression of mir <dig> by a stress may potentially activate myb33/ <dig> expression, resulting in morphological alterations in response to the stress.fig.  <dig> morphological and molecular phenotypes via induced inhibition of mir <dig>  a application of 17-β-estradiol to 21-day-old xve-mim <dig> transformants induced leaf-curling . the representative picture was taken when plants were 35-day-old short-day grown plants. b qrt-pcr of myb <dig>  myb <dig> and cp <dig> mrna levels in 35-day-old xve-mim <dig> rosettes with either mock  or inducer  treatments. mrna levels were normalized to cyclophilin. values are the mean of three technical replicates with error bars representing the sd. significant differences in values from the untreated are indicated with an *




the mir159-myb33/myb <dig> pathway has no major impact in the response to common abiotic stresses
mir <dig> function has been implicated in plant response to abiotic stresses, as mir <dig> levels are repressed during heat stress in wheat  <cit>  or in response to drought stress in potato  <cit> . for arabidopsis, we searched the genevestigator platform  and efp browser  for growth conditions that may activate cp <dig> transcription based on the assumption that this gene will be activated if mir <dig> function is compromised. however, cp <dig> mrna levels were found to remain low under all examined growth conditions and stresses . hence, it is unclear whether the mir159-myb33/myb <dig> pathway is playing a major role in response to abiotic/biotic stresses in arabidopsis.

to investigate whether mir <dig> is responsive to abiotic/biotic stresses in arabidopsis, wild-type plants were grown under several common environmental stresses including aba application, heat, high light intensity, drought, and cold and mir <dig> levels were measured. additionally, mir159ab.myb <dig> myb <dig> quadruple mutant plants were grown alongside to determine whether there are alterations to growth when the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway is mutated. also included in the analysis was the loss-of-function mir159a mutant in which mir <dig> abundance is reduced to approximately 10 % of wild type levels, but is morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type  <cit> , possibly making such a genotype sensitized to subtle perturbations of mir <dig> function which may not manifest in wild-type plants.

none of the tested stress conditions induced a major or obvious observable phenotypic difference between wild-type , mir159a and mir159ab.myb <dig> myb <dig> plants, where the two mutant genotypes appear indistinguishable from wild-type when grown under stress conditions . consistent with this, none of the stress conditions, or the stress-related aba hormone, resulted in suppression of mir <dig> to levels in which myb33/ <dig> expression would be predicted to be de-repressed . mir <dig> levels in plants subjected to high temperature had the lowest relative mir <dig> abundance, but this appears due to a higher level of the normalizing reference gene  rather than a decrease in abundance of mir <dig> . therefore, of the different conditions, low-temperature treatment appeared to result in the lowest levels of mir <dig>  although this reduction was not statistically different from untreated . nevertheless, we investigated mir <dig> response in cold stress further . however, the mrna levels of cp <dig> remained unchanged between col and the sensitized background, mir159a  , indicating that mir159-mediated silencing of myb33/ <dig> had not been strongly perturbed. this supports the observation that the col, mir159a and mir159ab.myb <dig> myb <dig> plants displayed no strong morphological differences under low temperature stress . from these experiments, it appears that the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway plays no major role resulting in an obvious phenotypic impact in response to these common abiotic stress conditions.fig.  <dig> morphological and molecular analysis of stressed arabidopsis mir159-myb pathway mutants. a phenotypic comparison of rosettes of col, mir159ab.myb <dig> myb <dig> and mir159a plants treated with aba, high temperature, high light, drought and cold. plants were grown for two weeks at 21 °c and then subjected to three weeks of stress treatment  taqman microrna assays measuring mir159a levels in wild-type plants subjected to the above treatments. levels were normalized to sno <dig>  values are the mean of three technical replicates with error bars representing the sd. significant differences in values from the control are indicated with an *

expression of viral silencing suppressors failed to strongly inhibit mir159
one likely biotic factor that could inhibit mir <dig> is the expression of viral silencing suppressor  proteins, which can interfere with one or more steps/factors of plant mirna biogenesis/action. to test this idea, 35s-p <dig> and 35s-p <dig> transgenes encoding the vsss p <dig> and p <dig> respectively were transformed into arabidopsis and multiple transformants were obtained for both constructs. most 35s-p <dig> transformants displayed reduced rosette sizes, indicating that p <dig> expression perturbs arabidopsis development , a finding previously observed  <cit> . however, these rosettes displayed no obvious leaf-curling, suggesting that 35s-p <dig> expression was not strongly perturbing mir <dig> function. by contrast, many 35s-p <dig> transgenic plants developed severe morphological abnormalities, which were characterized by a reduced rosette size and curled leaves . these abnormalities were consistent with what had been previously reported for this 35s-p <dig> transgene  <cit> , having characteristics similar to that of mir159ab rosettes and thus were further investigated.fig.  <dig> constitutive expression of vsss does not strongly perturb the mir <dig> silencing of myb33/ <dig>  a different phenotypes developed in 28-day-old 35s-p <dig> and 35s-p <dig> primary transformants with wild-type  grown alongside as a control. b the representative classification of developmental defects among 35s-p <dig> primary transformants. class i: wild-type-looking; class ii: mild reduction in rosette size and partially curled leaves; class iii: all leaves curled group; class iv: severely stunted and all leaves curled. c qrt-pcr analysis of relative mrna levels in the different classes. significant difference in values from the control is indicated with an *. d comparison of p <dig> mrna levels between 35s-p <dig> and 35s-p <dig> with the same classified phenotypes. the rna samples were extracted from 26-day-old plants. col and myb <dig> myb <dig> were used as controls. p <dig> mrna levels were normalized to ubiquitin , while myb33/ <dig> and cp <dig> were normalized to that of cyclophilin. values are the mean of three technical replicates with error bars representing the sd. significant differences between 35s-p <dig> and 35s-p <dig> values are indicated with an *




first, the 35s-p <dig> primary transformants were grouped into four classes, based on the severity of rosette defects . next, the p <dig> transcript level was measured in each class and was found to strongly correlate with the severity of morphological abnormalities , suggesting the p0-induced phenotypes are dose-dependent. to determine whether these phenotypes were potentially due to inhibition of mir <dig> function, myb <dig> and myb <dig> transcript levels were measured by qrt-pcr. with the exception of class i , mild increases  of myb <dig> and myb <dig> transcript levels were observed in all other 35s-p <dig> classes, positively correlating with the severity of abnormalities and the level of p <dig> transcript . however, although increases in cp <dig> mrna levels also positively correlated with both the p <dig> and myb33/ <dig> transcript levels , the fold change of cp <dig> mrna level was much lower than that observed in mir159ab, both in this study  and in previous reports  <cit> . this suggests that perturbation of mir <dig> function by p <dig> expression is mild and de-regulation of myb33/ <dig> may not be strongly impacting the phenotype of the 35s-p <dig> plants.

to investigate this possibility, the 35s-p <dig> transgene was transformed into a loss-of-function myb <dig> myb <dig> mutant  and grown alongside 35s-p <dig> col transformants . the 35s-p <dig> transformants developed similar phenotypes to those of 35s-p <dig> and could be grouped into the same phenotypic classes . moreover, qrt-pcr data demonstrated that the p <dig> transcript levels were similar in comparable 35s-p <dig> and 35s-p <dig> phenotypic classes . this finding indicated that similar p <dig> expression levels triggered similar phenotypic defects in both col and myb <dig> myb <dig> plants. hence, these p0-induced phenotypes are largely myb <dig> and myb <dig> independent, and not related to the mild increase of myb <dig> and myb <dig> mrna levels in 35s-p <dig>  this agreed with the weak induction of cp <dig> . together, these data suggest that p <dig> expression is unable to perturb mir <dig> sufficiently to result in strong de-repression of myb33/ <dig> expression.

the response of a myb <dig> myb <dig> mutant to turnip mosaic virus is indistinguishable from wild-type
the failure of the transgenically expressed vsss to strongly inhibit mir <dig> function may relate to their expression levels, which can be very high during viral infection  <cit> . thus, to further investigate the possibility of perturbing mir <dig> function with a biotic stress, arabidopsis was infected with turnip mosaic virus  that contains the vss helper component-proteinase , which sequesters srna duplexes  <cit> . tumv inoculations were made by infecting two leaves of three week-old wild-type  plants, followed by two weeks of post-inoculation growth at 21 °c, followed by one week at 15 °c. this lower growth temperature was used as there is evidence that it promotes viral infections .

three weeks post-inoculation, the infected rosettes developed symptoms including inhibited growth, upwardly-folded and twisted leaves, and exaggerated serrations of leaf edges and accelerated senescence . these symptoms vary in severity, which could be approximated as mild or severe with respect to the rosette size . to explore the impact of tumv infection on the mir159-myb pathway, transcript levels of tumv, myb <dig> and cp <dig> were analysed in the tumv-infected wild-type rosettes by qrt-pcr in two plants displaying mild symptoms and two plants displaying severe symptoms. first, analysis found that tumv rna accumulated to higher levels in the rosettes classified with severe symptoms, suggesting different levels of viral infection . correlating with these tumv transcript levels were myb <dig> mrna levels that were higher  in the tumv-infected plants compared with uninfected controls . consistent with possible myb <dig> de-regulation, cp <dig> mrna levels had increased  in most of these infected rosettes. generally, the abundance of mature mir159a/b were found to accumulate to higher levels in tumv-infected rosettes , consistent with the role of hc-pro in sequestrating srna duplexes, so an increased mir <dig> abundance likely reflects an accumulation of sequestered mir <dig>  <cit> . although all these data suggest that viral infection can inhibit mir <dig>  given the weak induction of cp <dig> in most infected plants, this would predict that myb33/ <dig> has only been weakly de-repressed.fig.  <dig> tumv infection does not appear to strongly perturb mir <dig> silencing of myb33/ <dig>  a morphological comparison between tumv-infected col and myb <dig> myb <dig> rosettes . plants were inoculated with either na2po <dig>  or tumv. b qrt-pcr analysis of relative mrna accumulations in rosettes with tumv-symptoms being classified as either mild  or severe . all mrna levels were normalized to cyclophilin. error bars represent the sd of three technical replicates. c analysis of mature mir <dig> levels in three tumv-infected rosettes, t1-t <dig>  the mir <dig> levels were normalized to sno <dig>  values are the mean of three technical replicates with error bars representing the sd



to gauge the impact of tumv infection on other mirnas families, the mrna levels of the canonical mirna targets phabulosa , cup-shaped cotyledon  <dig> , auxin response factor  <dig>  and tcp <dig>  were measured by qrt-pcr. the mrna levels of phb, cuc <dig> and arf <dig> were found to increase  in the rosettes showing severe tumv symptoms . these were generally higher fold-increases than that of myb <dig> . only tcp <dig>  had mrna levels increases similar to myb <dig>  possibly due to the low expression of mir <dig> in the rosette  <cit> . therefore, these data suggest that in comparison with mir <dig>  other mirna pathways might be more susceptible to de-regulation by tumv infection, making a stronger contribution to the observed symptoms.

finally, to determine the contribution of myb33/ <dig> de-regulation to the manifestation of tumv symptoms, a comparison of tumv-infected col and myb <dig> myb <dig> plants was performed. both tumv-infected col and myb <dig> myb <dig> plants developed similar abnormal leaves and rosettes that appeared indistinguishable from one another . together, all this data suggest that, although tumv can inhibit mir <dig>  it may do only weakly, being of no major physiological consequence for the plant in response to viral infection.

discussion
the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway has no major impact on rosette development or abiotic stress response
in arabidopsis, several conserved mirna families  control rosette development via regulation of their targets in specific spatiotemporal manners, impacting major leaf developmental traits such as phase change, leaf polarity and serration . in contrast, mir <dig> appears constitutively expressed throughout rosette development, both spatially and temporally, where it constantly represses myb33/ <dig> expression as cp <dig> mrna levels remained low. this extends our previous data showing that myb <dig> and myb <dig> are strongly repressed in arabidopsis vegetative tissues  <cit> . from our data we cannot rule out that myb33/ <dig> are expressed transiently or in a subtle cell type, where they may subtly impact development. however, it would appear that these genes are not playing a dominant role in arabidopsis rosette developmental ontogeny, at least under standard laboratory growth conditions. such a case is similar in rice, where the absence of gamyb and gamyb-like transcripts in vegetative tissues and the lack of obvious vegetative developmental abnormalities of a gamyb mutant, implies these genes play no major role in vegetative development  <cit> .

despite the lack of clear function, the pathway remains active throughout rosette development as inducible inhibition of mir <dig> could induce leaf curling. therefore, this led to the hypothesis that the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway may be responsive to an abiotic stress, where if mir <dig> is repressed, de-repression of myb33/ <dig> may possibly result in physiological/developmental outcomes that contribute to stress tolerance. supporting such a possibility are numerous studies reporting the alteration of mir <dig> levels in response to stress, implicating mir <dig> as a general stress-responsive mirna . despite this, we could find no evidence to indicate that mir <dig> becomes repressed under similar stress conditions, or changes in response to stress-related hormones such as aba. again, we cannot rule out that in certain cell types or under other stress conditions, or a combination of stress conditions, the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway does play a role. for example, the myb <dig> myb <dig> mutant has been shown to respond differently to wild-type after 4 h at 44 °c  <cit> . however, from our data, it appears that no major functional impact in the response to the tested stresses can be ascribed to the mir159-myb pathway, as there was no overt difference between wild-type and the mir159ab.myb <dig> myb <dig> mutant in response to these stresses. this also suggests that functionally relevant mir <dig> regulation of other targets is improbable as the absence of mir <dig> in the mir159ab.myb <dig> myb <dig> mutant does not make a major difference under the tested stresses. therefore, we propose that many of the fluctuations in mir <dig> levels observed during stress may have no major impact of functional consequence.

expression of vsss fails to strongly inhibit mir <dig> repression of myb33/65
consequently, we shifted our attention to biotic stresses, including viruses that express silencing suppressors  that could repress mir <dig>  as many viruses can result in symptoms resembling mir159ab-like phenotypes, such as tomato leaf curl virus that causes leaves to curl upwards to which mir <dig> has been linked  <cit> , we explored whether the transgenic expression of vsss or infection with viruses containing vsss could perturb mir <dig>  however, in these experiments, all our data indicates that mir <dig> silencing of myb33/ <dig> is not perturbed enough for this pathway to play a major role in response to such biotic stresses. for instance, similar p <dig> expression levels in 35s-p <dig> and 35s-p <dig> plants triggered symptoms of indistinguishable severity , indicating that the up-regulated expression of myb33/ <dig> in 35s-p <dig> was not a major factor in the observed p0-induced symptoms. additionally, tumv induced defects in col and myb <dig> myb <dig> plants appeared phenotypically indistinguishable , consistent with the marginal increased levels of myb33/ <dig> and cp <dig> in tumv infected col plants , again suggesting that perturbation of mir159-mediated regulation of myb33/myb <dig> plays no major role in tumv symptoms. both experiments suggest mir <dig> silencing of myb33/ <dig> is robust; given the morphological defects of the 35s-p <dig> plants or the transcript profiling in the tumv challenged plants, it was likely that other endogenous mirna pathways were strongly inhibited contributing in the observed morphological defects.

however, du et al.  <cit>  reported a possible causative role of mir <dig> in disease symptoms induced by a cucumber mosaic virus , as they compared the fny-cmv infected col and myb <dig> myb <dig>  showing phenotypic evidence that the infected col plants displayed more deformation of the upper, young systemically infected leaves. based on this, they concluded that mir <dig> contributes to fny-cmv induced symptoms  <cit> . therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that vsss differentially perturb the different mirna families, and that a vss exists that preferentially perturbs mir <dig>  like the identified viral impact on mir <dig> accumulation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
hence, despite our efforts, and a large body of previous work examining mir <dig> expression in arabidopsis rosettes, we have been unable to define a major role for the mir159-myb33/ <dig> pathway in the rosette. what is clear is that mir <dig> robustly represses myb33/ <dig>  where neither p <dig> and p <dig> vsss nor a range of stresses appear able to reduced mir <dig> sufficiently to enable de-regulation of myb33/myb <dig> expression to result in an obvious phenotype impact in response to the stress. with regards to general inhibitors of the mirna pathway, such as vsss, it seems other mirna systems are more sensitive to these inhibitors than mir <dig>  it would appear that an inhibitor that is specific to mir <dig> would be needed to result in activation of the myb pathway. curiously, in arabidopsis seeds, mir <dig> silencing of myb33/ <dig> appears weak relative to rosette tissue  <cit> , suggesting the presence of such an inhibitor, or another factor that controls silencing efficacy, may exist.

although the highly conserved mir159-myb pathway may have a regulatory role in the vegetative tissues of other plant species, here our data re-enforces the notion, that in arabidopsis, the predominant function of mir <dig> is to restrict the expression of myb <dig> and myb <dig> to seeds and anthers. interestingly, other gamyb-like genes in arabidopsis, such as myb <dig>  are predominantly transcribed in seeds and anthers, and this is also appears the case for gamyb in cereals  <cit> , both of which strongly contrast the apparent ubiquitous transcription of myb33/ <dig> in arabidopsis. given that there are multiple gamyb-like genes required for different steps of male development in arabidopsis  <cit> , during the duplication and divergence of myb33/ <dig>  these genes appear to have acquired this near constitutive transcriptional domain. as the activity of myb <dig> and myb <dig> promotes male fertility, there would be strong selection pressure for their strong expression. hence, we speculate this may result in strong transcription not only in the anther, but also in vegetative tissues. any negative impact of unnecessary myb33/ <dig> transcription in vegetative tissues , would be vastly outweighed by enhanced male fertility. indeed, although it could be considered that this mir159-myb33/ <dig> “futile” pathway may be energetically wasteful, there appears no obvious difference between wild-type and mir159ab.myb <dig> myb <dig> rosettes, and so such an energy investment may be not be large enough to confer a selective disadvantage. therefore, we speculate, that if a gene is mirna-regulated, there may be less pressure on cis-acting promoter elements to define its required spatial/temporal transcription pattern, as post-transcriptional regulation by mirnas provides an alternative mechanism to achieve the required protein expression.
