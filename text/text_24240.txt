BACKGROUND
the availability of floral homeotic mutants and the isolation of the corresponding genes represented a turning point in our understanding of the molecular basis of flower formation. these studies were mostly done in arabidopsis thaliana, antirrhinum majus and petunia hybrida, and led to the characterization of various mads-box transcription factors that were shown to be able to switch on genetic programs leading to the actual formation of the flower organs  <cit> .

tomato  is a species of enormous and worldwide economic importance and a large collection of mutants is presently hosted at the tomato genetics resource center . unfortunately, no tomato floral homeotic mutants were available in 1990’, when the abc model was proposed, therefore in those years efforts were focused on the isolation of tomato mads-box genes by screening with heterologous probes two tomato cdna libraries prepared from mrna of mature wild type flowers and anantha floral meristems, respectively  <cit> . in the anantha mutant the floral meristems are blocked before formation of the flower and they branch indefinitely giving rise to a cauliflower-like inflorescence  <cit> .

several mads-box coding cdnas were thus isolated and named tm  followed by a number. in particular, from the arrested floral meristem of the anantha mutant it was isolated a gene that was named tm <dig>  and was regarded as an “early” gene along the pathway of flower formation together with tm <dig>  while tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> were regarded as “late” genes along the same pathway  <cit> . northern blot assays revealed that tm <dig> was expressed in pistils, anthers and petals, although at much lower levels than the other mads-box genes. no transcripts were detected in sepals and leaves  <cit>  but this result might have depended on the low sensitivity of the northern technique compared to more modern types of analysis.

in a comprehensive work aimed at the characterization of the mads-box gene family in tomato, hileman et al.  <cit>  isolated a large number of new genes, and analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr their expression together with that of the previously known genes. it was thus shown that tm <dig> is expressed not only in the reproductive apparatus, but also in leaves.

probably the absence of a tm <dig> ortholog in arabidopsis made this gene of poor interest for further characterization. however, the limited knowledge of the possible function performed by tm <dig> was recently stressed by heijmans et al.  <cit>  who suggested that its functional characterization might be “of special interest in order to complete our understanding of mikcc gene function”.

matter of fact, after having isolated the first tomato mads-box genes, the same research group tried to functionally characterize them by preparing transgenic anti-sense plants for each gene. however, to our best knowledge, the only reference to the results obtained with tm <dig> is that found in lifschitz et al.  <cit>  where it was reported that  <dig> out of  <dig> transgenic plants exhibited severe deformation of the ovary and complete sterility. also an extremely high incidence of parthenocarpy was reported.

since after more than 20 years from the discovery of the tm <dig> gene the information about its function is still very scarce, we deemed of interest to study the possible role played by this gene in tomato. to do so we prepared transgenic tomato plants over-expressing it, but also transgenic plants over-expressing a chimeric gene carrying the tm <dig> sequence fused to the srdx transcriptional repressor domain  <cit> . the results obtained in this work indicate that tm <dig> may be important for anther but also for ovary and fruit formation. moreover, some phenotypic alterations were observed also for the leaves and this is in accordance with the observed normal expression of tm <dig> in this organ.

RESULTS
a functional characterization of tm <dig> was carried out by preparing transgenic plants with altered expression of the gene. its related cdna was obtained by rt-pcr experiments using specific oligonucleotides designed on the x <dig> sequence  <cit> . the cdna thus obtained was sequenced on both strands and it appeared that its coding region was actually  <dig> nucleotides longer than that of the x <dig> sequence. in particular,  <dig> and  <dig> extra-nucleotides were localized in the k and c domains, respectively . specific primers able to discriminate between the x <dig> sequence and the tm <dig> sequence isolated by us were used for pcr experiments with both genomic dna and cdna obtained from flowers and fruits. the results  showed that both sequences are present in the tomato genome, and this is in agreement with data from the published genome  <cit> . however, only the longer sequence isolated by us appeared to be expressed in the flowers and fruits of our tomato plants , therefore we decided to use the latter cdna for the preparation of transgenic florida petite plants.

phenotypic characterization of plants over-expressing the tm <dig> gene
 <dig> independent lines were obtained that harbored the 35s:tm <dig> construct as determined by pcr analyses carried out with genomic dna extracted from leaves . most of the transgenic lines did not show any macroscopic difference compared to the untransformed ones, however three lines produced flowers with anomalies in the androecia .figure  <dig>

normally the tomato anthers form a sort of cone that surrounds the distal part of the style . in the anomalous transgenic lines the anthers did not form a regular cone and appeared more  or less  splayed out. such morphological anomaly suggested that also the anther functionality might have been affected, hence pollen viability assays were performed for the three different lines showing various degrees of splayed out stamens. as it can be seen from table  <dig>  all three transgenic lines exhibited a highly reduced pollen viability compared to untransformed plants, with line # <dig> having an extremely low amount  of viable pollen. in accordance with the above data, all the three transgenic lines produced a significantly reduced amount of seeds per fruit, with line # <dig> yielding only seedless fruits . since the line with the strongest phenotype  produced seedless fruits and the very little seeds produced by the other two lines were poorly viable, the subsequent molecular characterization could be carried out only with the primary transformants.table  <dig>

molecular characterization of plants over-expressing the tm <dig> gene
in untransformed flowers the tm <dig> gene is generally expressed at very low levels in all four whorls with the highest transcript amount being found in petals, followed by anthers, sepals and ovaries . analyses were carried out on three different transgenic lines and two untransformed plants , and all the values shown here represent means of the three transgenic and the two untransformed plants, respectively. the only evident phenotypic effects in the tm <dig> over-expressing plants were those found in the stamens , accordingly the expression profile of mads-box genes normally expressed in this whorl was studied. four genes  are known in tomato that belong to the b class  <cit> . the over-expression of tm <dig> repressed the expression of the four genes in stamens , while in petals their expression appeared increased .figure  <dig>

considering the altered expression of the b-function genes in petals, we examined also the expression of macrocalyx  which is supposed to be an a-function gene in tomato  <cit> , and should therefore be expressed in both petals and sepals according to the abc model of arabidopsis flower development  <cit> . as expected, mc was expressed in both sepals and petals, however transcripts were observed also in anthers and ovaries . actually, sepals had the highest transcript amount followed by petals, ovaries and anthers, respectively. in the transgenic flowers mc showed unchanged expression levels in sepals and ovaries, while the gene transcripts appeared increased in petals and decreased in the splayed out anthers.

sepallata genes constitute the e function genes and are very important for the formation of all flower whorls since sep proteins form high order complexes with the abc transcription factors. in tomato five sep genes are found, tm <dig>  tm <dig>  slmbp <dig> , lemads <dig>  and rin   <cit> , therefore also their expression was analyzed in the tm <dig> over-expressing plants. interestingly, the tm <dig>  tm <dig> and slmbp <dig> genes showed a highly reduced expression in the splayed out anthers compared to the control ones . no apparent difference between transgenic and untransformed plants was found in whorls  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as regards lemads <dig>  and rin, the latter generally expressed at extremely low levels .

in tomato four genes  form the agamous subfamily  <cit>  although the genuine c function is represented by the tag <dig> and tagl <dig> genes while the other two represent the d function genes. interestingly, no expression difference was found for the c function genes in the transgenic pistils while a significantly decreased expression was found in the transgenic splayed out stamens . as regards the tagl <dig> and slmbp <dig> genes, they were expressed at high levels in ovaries and no difference was observed between tm <dig> over-expressing and untransformed plants .

phenotypic characterization of plants expressing the tm8:srdx chimeric repressor gene
the expression of the 35s:tm8:srdx construct does actually express the gene in the form of a dominant repressor  <cit> , and this technique has recently been used in tomato to study the role of the tagl <dig> mads-box gene in fruits  <cit>  but also of the sl-erf.b <dig> gene  <cit> .  <dig> independent transgenic lines, as judged on the basis of pcr assays carried out on genomic dna, were obtained and most of them showed visible alterations of the foliage morphology . in particular, a marked leaf epinasty was evident starting from very young seedlings. moreover, in all lines the transgenic leaves exhibited a darker green color compared to the untransformed ones, and this was confirmed by measurements of chlorophyll content .figure  <dig>

flower and fruit peduncles appeared longer compared to untransformed ones , and the abscission zone did not show a normal organization even when observed by esem microscopy . stamens looked like the wild-type ones, while the fourth whorl of the transgenic plants appeared anomalous. in particular, ovaries and fruits had an oblong form instead of being roundish , and all the transgenic lines yielded seedless fruits  therefore all the subsequent analyses had to be carried out using the primary transformants.

molecular characterization of plants expressing the tm8:srdx chimeric repressor gene
analyses were carried out on three different transgenic lines and two untransformed plants, and all the values shown here represent means of the three transgenic and the two untransformed plants respectively. as assessed by real time pcr  the chimeric repressor transgene was expressed in the transformed plants, therefore the presence of an anomalous phenotype, different from the one induced by the gene over-expression, can be ascribed to the expression of the chimeric repressor.

it is known that in tomato the jointless  mads-box gene controls the correct formation of the abscission zone in the flower and fruit peduncle  <cit> . since in our plants such abscission zone did not show a correct organization, the expression of jointless was analyzed in these abnormal zones and the transcript amount of this gene resulted significantly reduced compared to the untransformed ones .figure  <dig>

the marked leaf epinasty suggested at first sight an over-production of ethylene by those leaves, yet, in spite of an increased expression of the aco <dig> gene , which is known to be involved in ethylene biosynthesis in tomato  <cit> , no ethylene production could be measured under our experimental conditions. probably in leaves the production of ethylene was below the sensitivity threshold of the used instrument since the hormone could be measured in the tm8:srdx fruits where it turned out to be produced in amount comparable to that of the untransformed ones .figure  <dig>

in dark-grown seedlings it is known that in the ethylene-induced hook formation a role is played also by auxin, and an interaction between the two hormones has been shown also for leaf epinasty  <cit> . in order to understand whether auxin might be involved also in the leaf epinasty observed in our transgenic plants it was decided to study the expression of those genes coding for aux/iaa proteins whose role has already been clarified.

the sliaa <dig> gene has expression regulated by both auxin and ethylene  <cit> . the down-regulation of this gene reduced the ethylene-induced leaf epinasty, thus suggesting a direct relation between expression of the gene and rate of epinasty  <cit> . in the transgenic plants with strong epinasty the expression of this gene appeared significantly increased in the leaves while it was reduced in the elongated flower peduncles .

recently, the gene sliaa <dig> coding for another aux/iaa protein has been characterized  <cit> . in particular, it has been shown that its silencing leads to the formation of elongated fruits that look like those produced by the 35s:tm8:srdx tomato plants. moreover, the sliaa <dig> silenced plants had leaves with a reduced chlorophyll content. interestingly, in our transgenic leaves with increased chlorophyll content the sliaa <dig> gene shows an increased expression, while in the elongated fruits the transcript amount appears reduced compared to that of the untransformed fruits .

regarding sliaa <dig> , its down-regulation led to the formation of parthenocarpic fruits  <cit>  similarly to what observed in thetm8:srdx expressing plants. interestingly, in the latter plants the sliaa <dig> gene had a significantly reduced expression in ovaries and very young fruits , that is when seed set is supposed to occur .

the expression of various mads-box genes involved in the formation of the reproductive structures was studied in the tm8:srdx expressing plants. of the four known tomato b class genes, tm <dig> and tap <dig> did not show any significantly modified expression, while both slglo <dig> and slglo <dig> had a significantly increased expression both in stamens  and in petals . the expression of the mc gene was unaffected in anthers but not in the other three whorls. the transcript amount appeared increased in sepals and decreased in petals, while in the anomalous ovaries mc had significantly increased expression levels . of the four genes belonging to the agamous subfamily, tag <dig> and tagl <dig>  showed a decreased expression in ovaries and no variation in stamens , while no variations at all was found in these two whorls for tagl <dig> and slmbp <dig> . finally, the five sepallata genes did not show any significantly changed expression in whorls  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> but for a slightly decreased expression of tm <dig> in the sole transgenic anthers .

the gene ovate is known in tomato for being involved in the determination of the fruit shape, and its reduced expression could be related to a change in the fruit morphology  <cit> . the tm8:srdx expressing plants produced elongated ovaries and fruits and the ovate transcripts were significantly reduced in both ovaries and very small fruits  which are the developmental stages most relevant for ovate expression and the establishment of the fruit shape .

finally, in the elongated fruits both the production of ethylene and the expression of the aco <dig> gene were basically comparable to those of the untransformed fruits, thus confirming that the oblong fruits can undergo a normal ripening process .

mads-box protein interactions
given the notable involvement of tm <dig> in the development of the tomato reproductive structures, we checked the possible ability of the tm <dig> protein to interact with other mads-box transcription factors involved in the development of these structures. to this aim we carried out a large set of tests by means of the yeast two hybrid technique which is a methodology widely used to evaluate the capacity of mads transcription factors to hetero- and/or homo-dimerize in vitro  <cit> .

tm <dig> was not able to form either homo-dimers or complexes with any of the four tomato b type mads-box transcription factors . the same incapacity to form hetero-dimers was observed when tm <dig> was assayed with either jointless or the three sepallata-like proteins  whose cognate genes had shown a markedly affected expression in the flowers with altered tm <dig> expression . similarly, tm <dig> did not hetero-dimerize with either tag <dig> or tagl <dig>  two tomato c type mads-box proteins. matter of fact, the tm8-tag <dig> complex could very weakly promote the transcription of just one reporter gene , whilst his <dig> was not transcribed. moreover, the weak ade <dig> activation was only observed when using tm <dig> as bait and tag <dig> as prey, therefore these results suggest that this interaction is not solid. interestingly, our yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that tm <dig> can hetero-dimerize with mc . the tm8-mc interaction is quite solid since it was detected both with tm <dig> as the bait and when mc was the bait protein. moreover, in both cases the tm8-mc complex was able to activate the transcription of the two reporter genes .table  <dig>

amedia lacking either adenine or histidine  all the four b-function genes and macrocalyx appeared significantly up-regulated in the tm <dig> over-expressing petals. on the contrary, a mixed situation was found in the tm8:srdx expressing petals: the slglo <dig> and slglo <dig> genes appeared similarly up-regulated and the tm <dig> and tap <dig> genes showed no variations in expression, while macrocalyx showed a decreased expression. since no significant morphologic difference could be evidenced in petals of both types of transgenic plants, it appears that the observed changes in the expression of both macrocalyx and the b-function genes is not sufficient for significantly altering the petal morphology.

however, the data regarding the expression of mc in our transgenic plants suggest that this gene must play some role in the differentiation of the whole tomato flower. in fact, even though mc is considered a putative a-function gene, its expression in the fully differentiated flowers was not restricted to the first two whorls, as one would expect on the basis of the canonical abc model  <cit> . on the contrary, macrocalyx was expressed in all  <dig> whorls, and had a significantly changed expression in both the splayed out anthers and the anomalous ovaries, respectively.

the identity of flower organs is specified by various mikc mads-box transcription factors which act in a combinatorial manner  <cit> . the molecular networks formed by these proteins have been extensively explored using yeast two hybrid assays  <cit> . such studies have been performed also in tomato  <cit> , however the possible interactions of the tm <dig> protein with other mads-box transcription factors was never examined. we therefore decided to use this technique to identify those tomato mads box proteins able to form heterodimers with tm <dig> 

unlike arabidopsis, tomato has two ap3-like proteins, tap <dig> and tm <dig>  <cit> , and two pi-like proteins, slglo <dig> and slglo <dig>  <cit> , which represent the b-class function. none of the b type mads box proteins was able to form dimers with tm <dig> in our yeast two hybrid assays. yeast two hybrid assays also excluded that tm <dig> is able to homo-dimerize. tm <dig> did not interact with tagl <dig> and tag <dig> either. regarding tag <dig>  we recorded a weak activation of the ade <dig> reporter gene, but we were not able to observe growth on media lacking histidine, which suggests that his <dig> was not activated. therefore it appears unlikely that tm <dig> and tag <dig> may form dimers in vivo.

tm <dig> did not physically interact in yeast with those tomato sepallata-like mads box protein  that had altered expression patterns in our transgenic plants, and also with jointless  <cit> . interestingly, tm <dig> was able to interact in yeast with macrocalix, and the dimer tm8-mc could promote the transcription of both reporter genes, ade <dig> and his <dig>  this confirms that the chimeric tm <dig> protein used for yeast assays is properly folded.

twenty years after the proposal of the abc model, a modification was introduced by causier et al.  <cit>  in the review “floral organ identity: 20 years of abcs” to account for the absence of an a-function in most plant species. schwarz-sommer and co-workers introduced a new -function  <cit>  important to define the floral meristem identity and to produce the sepals that are considered as the ground state of floral organs. our data seem to suggest that this model might apply also to the tomato flower, and that the activity of the tm <dig> protein might be mediated by interactions with the macrocalyx protein.

the over-expression of the tm8:srdx repressor chimera had macroscopic effects on both reproductive and vegetative structures. although it has been shown in tomato  <cit>  and in two gymnosperms  <cit>  that tm8-like genes are expressed also in leaves, the latter finding was unexpected because lifschitz et al.  <cit>  had reported anomalies only for the reproductive structures in their tm <dig> antisense tomato plants, while in our transgenic plants the leaves showed a marked epinasty and were greener compared to the untransformed ones. also the flower peduncles were different compared to wild-types since they did not differentiate a correct abscission zone. to the latter purpose, it is known that a correct expression of the mads-box gene jointless is necessary for the differentiation of a normal abscission zone in the tomato flower peduncle  <cit>  and, as expected, in the anomalous abscission zones of the tm8:srdx flower peduncles also the expression of jointless appeared significantly reduced, in agreement with the defective abscission zones.

in plants the physiological activity of a given hormone may also depend on its interactions with other hormones present in the same tissue, and this has been shown several times for ethylene and auxin  <cit> . in tomato it was demonstrated that sliaa <dig>  a gene coding for an aux/iaa protein, can be positively regulated by both auxin and ethylene, and antisense tomato plants for this gene had a reduced epinastic response compared to wild-type ones when treated with exogenous ethylene  <cit> . interestingly, in the tm8:srdx expressing plants the epinastic leaves had a significantly increased expression of the sliaa <dig> gene, while a significantly reduced transcript amount was found in the lengthened flower peduncles. therefore, the inability to measure the ethylene produced by the epinastic leaves might simply reflect the need for ethylene to just activate the expression of the sliaa3gene, therefore the hormone had not to be produced in enormous amounts. suggestions about a possible auxin involvement came also from other phenotypic characteristics of the 35s:tm8:srdx plants, like the elongated fruits, their parthenocarpy and the deep green color of the foliage. in fact, in these anomalous situations other genes involved in the signal transduction pathway of auxin showed an expression that was altered as expected on the basis of their demonstrated function  <cit> . however, the possible connection between tm <dig> and auxin remains elusive.

as regards the phenotypic anomalies of the reproductive structures observed in the tm8:srdx plants, they appeared to affect only whorl  <dig>  in particular, all the fruits were parthenocarpic, a characteristics already described by lifschitz et al.  <cit>  for their tm <dig> antisense tomato plants. on the contrary, the stamens had a normal appearance and the pollen viability was comparable with that of the wild-types, therefore the anomaly was evidently due to problems in the carpel whorl. actually, transgenic ovaries had an elongated shape that was maintained till the end of their development so that also ripe fruits had an ellipsoidal shape instead of being roundish like the untransformed ones. the shape of tomato fruits is under the control of various genes  <cit> , in particular a low expression of the ovate gene has been shown to be responsible for the formation of pear-shaped tomatoes  <cit> . recently, rodriguez et al.  <cit>  evidenced that ovate may also be involved in the formation of ellipsoidal tomatoes, which appears to be the case also for the35s:tm8:srdx fruits since the ovate gene had a significantly decreased expression in ovaries and very young fruits, that is when the fruit shape is established.

the c-function tag <dig> gene was shown by pnueli et al.  <cit>  to be expressed in stamens and carpels, and to be of basic importance for a correct differentiation of these two organs. in particular, they found that a down-regulated expression of the gene caused the appearance of relevant malformations, among which both male and female sterility were reported. in tomato tag <dig> and tagl <dig> are the genuine c function genes while tagl <dig> and slmbp <dig> are d-function genes. it is interesting to note that the expression of both tag <dig> and tagl <dig> was consistent with the role played by them during the differentiation of reproductive structures. in the tm <dig> over-expressing plants the two genes had significantly decreased expression in the anomalous stamens but not in the normal ovaries, on the contrary in the tm8:srdx expressing plants the two genes had normal expression levels in stamens and significantly reduced expression levels in the anomalous ovaries. since in the latter ovaries both the d-function and the e-function genes did not show any significantly varied expression compared to wild-type, the above data reinforce the role played by the tag <dig> and tagl <dig> genes in the development of tomato carpels  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
soon after its discovery, the expression profile of the tm <dig> gene was studied by means of a northern analysis and the authors found high transcript amounts in the anantha floral meristem where other mads-box genes  could not be detected. for this reason the tm <dig> gene was defined as an “early” gene and the others as “late” genes along the process of flower differentiation  <cit> . the above pattern of expression suggests that the early tm <dig> gene might, in some yet unknown way, regulate the expression of the late genes, and such an idea appears to be consistent with the results of this work, at least as far as the differentiation of whorls  <dig> and  <dig> and the expression of other mads-box genes are concerned. it will be interesting to study the relations between the expression of tm <dig> and the activity of auxin, a hormone that is known to be important for fruit set and development  <cit> .

recently, gramzow et al.  <cit>  showed that tm8-like genes are quite common also in gymnosperms. therefore, in spite of the generally low levels of expression observed for this type of gene, its involvement in the formation of the reproductive structures might be the reason for the widespread conservation of tm8-like genes in seed plants.
