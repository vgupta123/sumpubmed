BACKGROUND
pyruvate kinase catalyzes the transphosphorylation from pep to adp to generate pyruvate and atp in glycolysis  <cit> . pyks are highly conserved in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes  <cit> . in mammals, four types of pyk isoenzymes  with different kinetic properties are distributed in various tissues to satisfy the diverse metabolic requirements. most bacteria and lower eukaryotes have only one form of pyk. however, there are two identified pyk isoenzymes in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the activities of pyks are dependent on a bivalent and/or a univalent cation   <cit> . in the majority of organisms, pyk is a homotetramer that exhibits inactive/active reversible allosteric mechanisms  <cit> . the functional forms of pyks are divided into the following two broad types based on their allosteric effectors: type i is allosterically activated by fbp, whereas type ii is allosterically activated by amp and monophosphorylated sugars  <cit> . the allosteric behavior of pyk allows it to be an important switch point for the regulation of carbon flux distribution.

the two most studied allosteric pyk isoenzymes are those of e. coli and s. cerevisiae. in e. coli, pykf exhibited higher activity than pyka in vitro, and pykf and pyka played different roles in pyruvate synthesis and cell growth . in s. cerevisiae, fbp-activated pyk1p was the major enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of pep to pyruvate, whereas pyk2p with relatively low enzymatic activity was insensitive to fbp and subject to glucose repression, which suggested that pyk2p played a major role under conditions of low glycolytic flux  <cit> . to date, little is known about other pyk isoenzymes and their physiological function in other bacteria.


corynebacterium glutamicum is widely used for the industrial production of various amino acids and vitamins during aerobic cultivation due to the robustness of its genetic modifications and fermentation  <cit> . under oxygen deprivation, c. glutamicum can primarily convert glucose to pyruvate, which is an intermediate for the production of organic acids and amino acids despite the cessation of growth . two genes  were annotated as pyruvate kinases in the genome of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  <cit> . the deletion of pyk <dig> resulted in marginal pyk activity that was below the detection limit, which supported the assertion that c. glutamicum possessed only one pyruvate kinase  <cit> . pyk <dig> exhibited high catalytic activity using mn2+ or co2+ as a cation and subjected to amp activation and atp inhibition  <cit> . the expression of pyk <dig> was repressed by the global transcriptional regulator sugr, which binds to the promoters of many target genes involved in glycolysis  to regulate sugar metabolism  <cit> . the deletion of pyk <dig> led to decrease biomass and increase glutamic acid production  <cit> . therefore, pyk <dig> functioned as an effective metabolic engineering node for the production of various metabolites  <cit> . the genetic organization of the homologous pyk <dig>  which is adjacent to ldha, exists in many corynebacterium species. however, the function and biological significance of pyk <dig> has not been understood.

in this study, we identified ncgl <dig>  as a functional pyruvate kinase in c. glutamicum. pyk <dig> exhibited different enzymatic properties compared to pyk <dig> and could substitute for pyk <dig> in vivo. under oxygen deprivation, pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> deficiency decreased the generation of lactic acid, and the overexpression of either pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> increased the production of lactic acid.

RESULTS
pyk <dig> is a pyruvate kinase in c. glutamicum

ncgl <dig> was annotated as a pyruvate kinase in the genome of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> . this gene is adjacent to ldha and distant from pyk <dig> . a protein homology search and alignment indicated that pyk <dig> had moderate sequence identity to the functionally identified pyk <dig> of c. glutamicum , pykf of e. coli  and pyka of e. coli , but showed high sequence identity to the annotated homologs from other species of corynebacterium. using the pykf crystal structure from e. coli  as a template, the secondary structure of pyk <dig>  which ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> residues and  <dig> to  <dig> residues, consisted of  <dig> α-helices and  <dig> β-strands structures. this structure was similar to the catalytic domain a of pykf , in which the gdlgve motif served as the pep binding site and the conserved sequences assisted the fbp allosteric regulation. a long extra n-terminal sequence of  <dig> amino acids made pyk <dig>  larger than other typical bacterial pyks .

to demonstrate the function of pyk <dig> in vivo, the pyk <dig> and/or pyk <dig> genes were deleted in the chromosome. the wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strain grown on glucose under aerobic conditions exhibited only a slightly lower growth rate than the wt strain , which indicated that the conversion of pep to pyruvate during glucose transport by the phosphotransferase transport system  could supply pyruvate for cell growth . to eliminate the effect of the pyruvate generated from the glucose transport on growth, d-ribose, which was imported by the ribose-specific atp-binding cassette transport system, was employed as the sole carbon source to evaluate the role of pyk isoenzymes under aerobic conditions  <cit> . as shown in fig. 1a, the wtΔpyk <dig> strain showed similar growth compared to the wt strain. however, the wtΔpyk <dig> strain showed a 52% decrease in the final biomass and the wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strain failed to grow when d-ribose was the sole carbon source, which suggested that the pyk <dig> gene maintained cell growth on d-ribose to some extent. moreover, complementation of the wtΔpyk <dig> strain with the pyk <dig> gene restored its growth in the same manner as the pyk <dig> gene , which indicated that pyk <dig> could substitute for pyk <dig> in c. glutamicum. furthermore, complementation of the wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strain with pyk <dig> and pyk <dig> completely restored its growth . in addition, the overexpression of pyk <dig> in the wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strain made the specific activities of pyk  comparable to that of overexpression of pyk <dig>  in the wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strain. altogether, our results strongly supported that pyk <dig> functioned as a pyruvate kinase in vivo.fig.  <dig> growth of c. glutamicum strains on cgxii medium with 100 mm d-ribose under aerobic conditions. c. glutamicum strains were aerobically pre-cultivated in 50 ml of cgiii medium. after washing the cells in cgxii minimal medium, the cultures were inoculated to obtain optical densities at 600 nm of approximately  <dig>  . when necessary,  <dig>  mm iptg was supplemented after inoculation. a wt, wt∆pyk <dig>  wt∆pyk <dig> and wt∆pyk1∆pyk <dig>  b wt∆pyk1/pxmj <dig>  wt∆pyk1/pxmj19-pyk <dig> and wt∆pyk1/pxmj19-pyk <dig>  c wt∆pyk1∆pyk2/pxmj <dig>  wt∆pyk1∆pyk2/pxmj19-pyk <dig> and wt∆pyk1∆pyk2/pxmj19-pyk <dig>  the data were derived from experiments performed at least in three times, and the error bars represent the standard deviations




enzymatic properties of pyk2
to detect the activity of pyk <dig> in vitro, the pyk <dig> gene of c. glutamicum was expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  using the pet-28a expression system. n-terminal his-tagged pyk <dig> exhibited similar activity to pyk <dig> with the his-tag removed by thrombin cleavage. after further purification using ion exchange chromatography, the recombinant pyk <dig> showed an approximately  <dig> -fold purification with a yield of 37% and a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg. the molecular weight of the recombinant pyk <dig> subunit was  <dig>  da . gel filtration chromatography yielded a  <dig>  da fraction that corresponded to the predicted size of a homohexamer, which was different from the homotetramer observed for other pyks .fig.  <dig> enzymatic properties of pyk <dig> from c. glutamicum. a sds-page of purified pyk <dig>  lane  <dig>  supernatant of crude extract from e. coli bl21/pet-28a; lane  <dig>  supernatant of crude extract from e. coli bl21/pet-28a-pyk2; lane  <dig>  pyk <dig> purified by his-tagged affinity chromatography; and lane  <dig>  pyk <dig> purified by ion exchange chromatography. b molecular weight determination by gel filtration chromatography. the molecular weight of a protein could be determined from the calibration curve . the kav value was calculated from the measured elution volume using the following equation: kav = /, where ve is the elution volume, vo is the column void volume, and vc is the geometric column volume. the logarithm of the molecular weight was represented as lgmw. the standard proteins were shown as follows :  <dig>  ovalbumin ;  <dig>  conalbumin ;  <dig>  aldolase ;  <dig>  ferritin ; and  <dig>  thyroglobulin . the native molecular weight of pyk <dig> was determined to be a homohexamer of  <dig>  . c the enzyme activity of pyk <dig> at different temperatures. the maximum value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u/mg was set as relative 100%. d enzyme activities of pyk <dig> at various phs . e enzyme activities of pyk <dig> in the presence of various monovalent ions . the enzyme was incubated in 100 mm tris-hcl buffer  and 5 mm mn2+ with 50 mm or 100 mm monovalent ions. the data were derived from at least three replicate experiments, and the error bars represent the standard deviations




pyk <dig> was active at temperatures between  <dig> and 50 °c, with a maximal activity at 35 °c . the enzyme maintained greater than 80% of its relative activity at a ph range between  <dig> and  <dig>  with a maximal activity at ph  <dig>  . pyk <dig> exhibited an absolute dependence on mn2+ together with a monovalent cation. this finding was quite different from pyk <dig> in c. glutamicum, which only used mn2+ or co2+ as cations  <cit> . among all the tested monovalent cations, the maximum activity of pyk <dig> was detected in the presence of 5 mm mn2+ and 100 mm k+. when nh4
+, na+, or li+ was substituted for k+, the relative activities of pyk <dig> were maintained at  <dig>   <dig>  and 38%, respectively .

kinetic parameters of pyk2
the kinetics of pyk <dig> were determined with respect to pep and adp as described in the methods section . as shown in table s <dig>  the s
 <dig>  value of pyk <dig> for pep was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, and the k
cat value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s− <dig>  which was lower than that of pyk <dig>  <cit> . the k
cat value of pyk <dig> for adp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s− <dig>  and the s
 <dig>  value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm ; this latter value was  <dig> -fold higher than that of c. glutamicum pyk <dig> , which indicated that pyk <dig> had a relatively lower affinity for adp compared to pyk <dig> fig.  <dig> kinetic parameters of pyk <dig>  the kinetic parameters of pyk <dig> with respect to the substrates are shown. a pep. b adp. the kinetic parameters of pyk <dig> with respect to pep at a concentration of 5 mm different effectors are shown. c fbp. d atp. e cit. the data points were fitted to the allosteric-sigmoidal equation using prism software . the s
 <dig>   and k
cat values were calculated. the experiments were performed at least in three times, and the error bars represent the standard error of the regression




the kinetic properties of pyk <dig> in response to different effectors were determined to understand its allosteric regulation. in the presence of 5 mm fbp , the s
 <dig>  of pyk <dig> for pep was dramatically decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm and the k
cat value was increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s− <dig>  which demonstrated that pyk <dig> was dependent on fbp activation. however, glucose-6-phosphate  had no significant effect on the s
 <dig>  and k
cat of pyk <dig> . in addition, there was no significant effect of amp on the s
 <dig>  and k
cat of pyk <dig> . the kinetic properties of pyk <dig> were similar to e. coli pykf and different from c. glutamicum pyk <dig>  which was activated by amp  <cit> . moreover, atp had an inhibitory effect on pyk <dig> because the k
cat for pep decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s− <dig> . in addition, in the presence of citrate , the sigmoidal nature of the activity curve increased to a hill coefficient of  <dig>  that was indicative of increased cooperativity . altogether, the fbp-activated pyk <dig> was different from the amp-activated c. glutamicum pyk <dig> 

the expression of pyk <dig> is induced under oxygen deprivation
considering that the transcriptional direction of pyk <dig> and the neighboring ldha genes in the chromosome are similar, rt-pcr was performed using two primers designed against the overlapping adjacent region of the two genes to determine whether pyk <dig> and ldha were co-transcribed. under aerobic conditions, a single 491 bp pcr product was obtained, which indicated that pyk <dig> and ldha were co-transcribed as a bicistronic mrna . the expression levels of pyk <dig>  pyk <dig> and ldha in the wt strain were then further investigated using qrt-pcr under aerobic and oxygen-deprived conditions. the mrna level of pyk <dig> under oxygen deprivation was  <dig> -fold higher than that under aerobic conditions , which indicated that pyk <dig> was induced at the transcription level under oxygen deprivation. the mrna level of ldha under oxygen deprivation was  <dig> -fold higher than under aerobic conditions, which was consistent with the observed increase of ldha expression in the wt strain under low oxygen tension  <cit> . in contrast, the mrna level of pyk <dig> under oxygen deprivation exhibited a  <dig> -fold increase compared to the mrna level obtained under aerobic conditions.fig.  <dig> expression of the ldha and pyk <dig> genes in c. glutamicum. a identification of the co-transcription of ldha and pyk <dig> in the ldha-pyk <dig> cluster using rt-pcr. the c. glutamicum wt strain was cultured in minimal medium with glucose under aerobic conditions. the templates used for the pcr were as follows: lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  total rna reverse transcribed without reverse transcriptase; lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  genomic dna; and lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  cdna. the fragments in lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were amplified using the primers wz1181/wz <dig> for rpob. in addition, the primers wz <dig> and wz <dig> were used for the ldha-pyk <dig> region in lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  b the relative transcription levels of the pyk <dig>  pyk <dig> and ldha genes were analyzed by qrt-pcr. total rna was isolated from wt cells harvested at the exponential phase under aerobic conditions and at 3 h cultivation under oxygen-deprived conditions. the expression levels of pyk <dig>  pyk <dig> and ldha under different conditions were compared against the expression of pyk <dig> under aerobic conditions . the mean values from at least three independent cultures are shown with the standard deviations




the pyk activities in the wt, wtΔpyk <dig>  wtΔpyk <dig> and wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strains were investigated under aerobic and oxygen-deprived conditions. the pyk activity in the wt strain under oxygen-deprived conditions increased by 12% compared to the activity under aerobic conditions, which was mainly attributed to the increased expression of pyk <dig> . the deficiency of pyk <dig> resulted in a 97% decrease in pyk activity; however, the pyk activity in the wtΔpyk <dig> strain was comparable to that in the wt strain under aerobic conditions. in addition, there was no significant difference in the specific glucose consumption rate and the specific growth rate of the wtΔpyk <dig> strain compared with the wt strain , which indicated that the pyk <dig> gene might maintain a relatively low expression level under aerobic conditions. in contrast, pyk <dig> deficiency led to a 15% decrease in pyk activity under oxygen-deprived conditions, and pyk <dig> could only maintain 85% of pyk activity in the wtΔpyk <dig> strain compared to the wt strain. therefore, these results illustrated that the expression of pyk <dig> was induced and contributed to increased whole cell pyk activity under oxygen deprivation.table  <dig> the production of organic acids by c. glutamicum strains under oxygen deprivationa

the effect of pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> expression on the production of lactic acid under oxygen deprivation
pyk <dig> had a slight effect on pyk activity under aerobic conditions, and therefore, the role of pyk <dig> was further investigated in the wt, wtΔpyk <dig>  wtΔpyk <dig> and wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strains under oxygen-deprived conditions. there was no obvious difference in the glucose consumption rate; however, a significant change was observed in the production of organic acids among these strains . the yield of lactic acid from glucose in the pyk1- or pyk2-deficient strains was similar, but there was a  <dig> and 7% decrease in the production of lactic acid in the wtΔpyk <dig> and wtΔpyk <dig> strains, respectively, compared to the wt strain. the production of lactic acid in the double mutant decreased by 22%, and the yield further decreased by 23%. in contrast, the variation tendency of production of succinic acid was opposite to that of lactic acid. compared to the wt strain, the production of succinic acid was  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold higher in the wtΔpyk <dig> and wtΔpyk <dig> strains, respectively. in addition, the titers of acetic acid were lower in the three mutants. these results indicated that pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> deficiency decreased the generation of lactic acid and increased the formation of succinic acid.


pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> was overexpressed in the wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> and wt strains to determine their effects on the production of organic acids. complementation of the wtΔpyk1Δpyk <dig> strain with pyk <dig> and pyk <dig> resulted in a lactic acid production that was comparable to that of the wt strain . pyk activity was restored to a similar level as the wt strain. furthermore, the titers of acetic acid in the three mutants were not significantly different from those of the wt strain. however, the overexpression of the pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> gene produced a  <dig> and 17% increase in the production of lactic acid in the wt strain, with  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold higher pyk activities, respectively. in addition, the production of succinic acid was significantly decreased, and the production of acetic acid was increased in the mutants. therefore, the overexpression of either pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> increased the production of lactic acid under oxygen deprivation.

fed-batch lactic acid production of the pyk2-overexpressing strain
because both mn2+ and k+ are necessary for pyk <dig> activity, the effects of the concentrations of mnso <dig> and kcl in the medium on the production of lactic acid were investigated in the wtΔpyk1/pxmj19-pyk <dig> strain under oxygen deprivation. the production of lactic acid was enhanced by increasing the concentration of mn2+ and reached the highest level of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm with a yield of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at 1 g/l mnso <dig> . the production of lactic acid was improved and then gradually decreased with increasing concentrations of kcl . the highest concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm with a yield of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % was obtained in the presence of 3 g/l kcl. these results demonstrated that the activation of pyk <dig> activity by mn2+ and k+ contributed to the increased production of lactic acid.fig.  <dig> lactic acid production by c. glutamicum strains under oxygen deprivation. a the effects of mnso <dig> and kcl on lactic acid production by the wt∆pyk1/pxmj19-pyk <dig> strain. the cells were suspended to a final dry cell weight of 10 g/l in 100 ml of cgxii medium with 100 mm bicarbonate. b fed-batch production by the wt∆pyk <dig> strain under oxygen deprivation. c fed-batch production by the wt∆pyk1/pxmj19-pyk <dig> strain under oxygen deprivation. for the fed-batch fermentation experiments, the cells were suspended to a final dry cell weight of 20 g/l in 3 l of cgxii medium with 100 mm bicarbonate. the data were derived from experiments performed at least in three times, and the error bars represent the standard deviations

discussion
pyk is an important control node in response to changes in glycolysis and energy charges. two isoenzymes of pyk have been found to be subjected to allosteric regulation by different effectors in e. coli and s. cerevisiae  <cit> . c. glutamicum was assumed to possess only one pyk with higher activity compared to other bacterial pyks  <cit> . in this study, pyk <dig> was identified as a functional isoenzyme in c. glutamicum. because pyk <dig> was mn2+ and k+ co-dependent, marginal pyk <dig> activity was detected in the pyk1-deficient mutant in the absence of the k+ cation. this indicated that the binding of k+ might induce the conversion of pyk <dig> from the inactive conformation into the active conformation  <cit> . our results confirmed that pyk <dig> was activated by fbp despite the deficiency in the c-terminal domain containing the binding sites for the allosteric effector fbp in other pyks  <cit> . consequently, we inferred that c. glutamicum pyk <dig> might utilize a distinct allosteric mechanism that differed from other known fbp-activated pyks. in c. glutamicum, the different allosteric activators of pyk <dig> and pyk <dig> made them subject to distinct metabolic regulation mechanisms similar to the regulation of the two isoenzymes in e. coli and s. cerevisiae  <cit> . under oxygen deprivation, the restriction of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , a glycolysis rate-limiting enzyme, might result in the accumulation of fbp  <cit> , which activated pyk <dig> to direct the metabolic flux of pyruvate towards the formation of lactic acid. the allosteric effect of pyk <dig> resulted in a regulatory role in pyruvate metabolism under oxygen deprivation.

the pyk <dig> and ldha in c. glutamicum were co-transcribed under aerobic conditions; therefore, pyk <dig> followed the complicated regulatory mode of ldha, which was subjected to dual repression under aerobic conditions mediated by the global regulator sugr and the special regulator lldr  <cit> . sugr-mediated primary repression of ldha and pyk <dig> transcription was relieved in the presence of sugar to induce lactic acid formation. in turn, the generated lactic acid alleviated the lldr-mediated repression to enhance the transcription of ldha and pyk <dig>  <cit> . however, the mrna level of pyk <dig> was significantly higher than the mrna level of ldha under oxygen deprivation, which indicated that pyk <dig> had a different transcription mode.

under oxygen deprivation, c. glutamicum produces organic acids such as lactic acid, succinic acid and acetic acid from glucose with cell growth arrested  <cit> . the deletion or overexpression of two pyk genes had a significant influence on the production of organic acids. the deficiency of pyk <dig> led to a decrease in the production of lactic acid and an increase in the synthesis of succinic acid. moreover, the overexpression of pyk <dig> promoted the formation of pyruvate and the production of lactic acid, whereas the metabolic flux from pep towards oxaloacetate might decrease and led to decreased synthesis of succinic acid. under oxygen deprivation, when the availability of pyruvate was decreased, the redundant pep was redirected to synthesize succinic acid by pep carboxylase, which was the predominant anaplerotic enzyme  <cit> . our findings confirmed that c. glutamicum regulated the synthesis of lactic acid and succinic acid by pyk and pep carboxylase to maintain the intracellular nadh/nad+ equilibrium under oxygen deprivation  <cit> . therefore, our results suggested that pyk is a key factor that influences the formation of lactic acid in c. glutamicum under oxygen deprivation.

furthermore, pyk <dig> homologs had been annotated in the genomes of corynebacterium, mycobacterium, geobacillus, etc. the ldha-pyk <dig> cluster has been found in many representative corynebacterium species . a transcriptional unit composed of several genes encoding enzymes involved in the catalysis of related metabolic reactions has been proposed to be an effective means to rapidly adjust bacterial metabolism under different conditions  <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that lactate dehydrogenase and pyk <dig> might be interdependent and play an important role in diverting the metabolic flux into lactic acid formation in c. glutamicum under low oxygen tensions. therefore, the evolution of the ldha-pyk <dig> cluster for lactic acid synthesis grants c. glutamicum more metabolic flexibility in response to environmental changes.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we identified that pyk <dig> is a novel pyruvate kinase in c. glutamicum and has significantly different biochemical properties than pyk <dig>  the catalytic activity of pyk <dig> was allosterically regulated by fbp activation. the allosteric behavior of pyk made it an important switch point for the regulation of the glycolytic carbon flux distribution. pyk <dig> and ldha were co-transcribed as a bicistronic mrna under aerobic conditions. however, the mrna level of pyk <dig> in the wt strain was increased under oxygen deprivation and pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> deficiency decreased the production of lactic acid. the overexpression of either pyk <dig> or pyk <dig> increased the activity of pyk and the production of lactic acid. the fed-batch fermentation of the pyk2-overexpressing strain resulted in increased lactic acid production than the parent strain, which indicated that overexpression of pyk redirected more carbon flux into lactic acid production under oxygen deprivation.
