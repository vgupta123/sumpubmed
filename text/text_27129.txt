BACKGROUND
hevea brasiliensis  muell.-arg. is a tree native to the brazilian amazon region and it is botanically classified in the angiospermae division, class dicotyledoneae, and family euphorbiaceae. many species from the euphorbiaceae produce latex in specialized cells . in the case of h. brasiliensis, the latex is a stable emulsion of isoprenoid polymers widely employed to produce natural rubber. in the amazon, the population of h. brasiliensis is estimated to be one of the twenty most abundant tree species  <cit> . hevea brasiliensis is also the most abundant specie of the genus, with the largest production capacity, accounting for about 99% of all natural rubber produced in the world, and with the greatest genetic variability  <cit> . natural rubber is a strategic natural raw material used in more than  <dig>  industrial products, including  <dig> medical devices  <cit> . due to its structure and high molecular weight , natural rubber presents special features such as resilience, elasticity, resistance to abrasion and impact, which cannot be achieved by synthetic polymers  <cit> . increased demand for natural rubber on the international market and, consequently, the strengthening of the price, has promoted the rubber cultivation, placing rubber production within the range of highly attractive options available  <cit> .

one of the major challenges for rubber tree cultivation is its adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress. in areas with a notable dry season and low mean temperatures, rubber cultivation is characterized by a long period of immaturity. in tropical regions of latin america where the high level of relative humidity might be more suitable for rubber development, the climatic conditions are also conducive to the infection of rubber tree leaves by the fungus microcyclus ulei, the causal agent of the south american leaf blight. repeated attacks of this disease cause massive losses of leaves, leading to plant death. the main strategies proposed for avoiding the m. ulei damage in plantations involve cultivating genotypes tolerant for dryness and cold in sub-optimal areas and promoting new salb-resistant and productive cultivars in tropical areas  <cit> . one of the measures for avoiding m. ulei infection takes advantage of the strict high temperature and air humidity conditions for the fungus to reproduce. based on this requirement, two infection avoidance strategies can be proposed: climatic escape, where leaf exchanges occur during the dry season, when weather conditions are not favorable to fungal sporulation or growing rubber trees in sub-optimal areas . both approaches inhibit m. ulei infection, but also may reduce rubber tree yield. the important factor for rubber cultivation is the vegetative fitness of the tree, which is directly reflected in the genetic potential of the cultivated clone  <cit> . the rrim <dig> oriental clone is classified as susceptible to salb, and highly productive over a range of temperatures and relative humidity.

breeding between inbreeds with different characteristics targeting tolerance of biotic and abiotic stress has been identified as an alternative for improving rubber tree growth and production. overcoming such challenges can be assisted through the development of new strategies and tools in the biotechnology field. of those tools, we can highlight sequencing of the expressed genome of h. brasiliensis , representing the complete set and quantity of transcripts in a cell or tissue for a specific developmental stage and/or physiological condition  <cit> . in the rubber tree, the identification and characterization of expressed genes may improve our understanding of plant tolerance of biotic and abiotic stress, and the regulation of latex biosynthesis. thus, the objectives of our study were to capture the transcriptional profile of a large variety of hevea brasiliensis organs and tissues with a view to completing the available reference transcriptomes, then to identify in silico snp and ssr markers and, lastly, develop the first snps markers in the rubber tree.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and assembling
in order to capture the h. brasiliensis mass transcriptional profile with reduced sequencing costs, cdna libraries were prepared from pooled rna extracts of different tissues. total rna was extracted from  <dig> organs of the rrim <dig> genotype and open-pollinated seedlings of rrim <dig> . two main cdna libraries were developed; one from a pool of rrim <dig> rna, and the other from tissues of rrim <dig> ops . together these runs produced  <dig>  roche / <dig> reads of lengths ranging from  <dig> to 873 bp and a mean of 379 bp . after checking and trimming for quality scores , adapters, polya/t tails and repetitive elements,  <dig>  sequences accounting for  <dig> , <dig> bases were inputted to the newbler  <dig>  assembler for contig generation . newbler assembly generated  <dig>  contigs covering  <dig> , <dig> bases; the n <dig> metric was 837 bp  and the mean gc content was  <dig> %. on average, each contig received  <dig> x coverage ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  reads. a large number of contigs  resulted from the assembly of reads from the rrim <dig> and rim <dig> ops libraries . to overcome the problem of multiple contigs assembled from the same transcript, a scaffolding step by translational mapping  was attempted. the joint assembly predict was built containing  <dig>  sequences with an average length of 720 bp ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. de novo transcriptome assemblies may be substantially improved by the addition of a scaffolding step where the contigs belonging to a single transcript are ordered, orientated, and assembled  <cit> . approximately 5% of our assembly could be joined onto scaffolds, indicating a low redundancy of contigs. also, our results of  <dig>  scaffolds, n50 = 837 bp, a mean length of contigs equal to 676 bp and other metrics agreed with de novo sequencing from other plants  <cit> .

to verify the consistency of the assembly, a tblastx analysis was performed against the existing  <dig>  est sequences from h. brasiliensis deposited at the ncbi database by chow,  <dig>  <cit>  generated by sanger sequencing technology. the results indicated a coverage of 72% of the previously deposited hevea ests available in ncbi . only 7% presented less than 90% similarity and only 4% had an e-value higher than 1e- <dig>  the high similarity between the assembly and the deposited hevea est sequences suggested a consistent assembly and good coverage of the hevea transcriptional landscape from all the tissues.

triwitayakorn et al.  <cit>  sequenced the expressed genome of the h. brasiliensis from the vegetative shoot apex of the rubber tree using the  <dig> platform, obtaining a larger number of reads  with a lower average read length  but with a similar number and size of the assembled sequences in  <dig>  isogroups  ranging between  <dig> and 1000 bp, while our assembly produced  <dig>  contigs with 676 bp on average. apart from the higher number of reads and the sampling of a few exclusive rubber tree tissues by triwitayakorn et al.  <cit> , the overall assembly process was very similar.

transcriptome annotation
contigs were first annotated against a set of plant reference proteins  by blastx. a total of  <dig>  contigs identified matches with an e-value cut-off less than 1e- <dig> . in an attempt to obtain a maximum of annotated contigs, a tblastx was carried out using the plant unique transcript  database for hevea brasiliensis ests with  <dig>  entries in order to cover the transcripts that might lack protein annotation and could not be found in other databases. subsequently, we performed a blastx against the non-redundant ncbi protein database with the still unannotated contigs. in total,  <dig>  non-annotated contigs were used as input and  <dig> contigs displayed a high score and a low e-value in the alignment with the hevea put database . the numbers presented by our score , identity  and e-value statistics  demonstrated a well performed assembly process since few non-matches  were observed at the end of entire blast annotation process. our percentage of annotated sequences  was quite similar to the transcriptome of xia et al.  <cit>  who obtained 76% of annotated sequences, of which  <dig> % matched with ricinus communis  . differently, for the hevea trancriptome of triwitayakorn et al.  <cit> , 48% of sequences matched with manihot esculenta, followed by r. communis .

sequential annotation

to classify contigs correctly, a search for protein signatures was performed by interpro scan on open reading frames  from each contig for protein domains, panther  evidence, tigr  and fingerprint  evidence, resulting in  <dig>  ipr signatures;  <dig> protein family fingerprints;  <dig>  protein domain families;  <dig>  panther families;  <dig> different structure families; and  <dig> tigr families. these protein domains were associated with  <dig> go terms  belonging to the three go categories  . the go terms ‘cell part’, ‘binding activity’, and ‘metabolic processes’ were the most represented classes in each go category . also, five genes  implicated in the mevalonate pathway  and consequently in natural rubber biosynthesis, were identified . cog analysis successfully classified  <dig>  out of  <dig>  sequences on  <dig>  groups . the orthology cluster described as ‘unknown function’ and general ‘prediction only’ accounted for 22% of annotations; another major clustering was related to translational and post translational functions  . the search for genes involved in metabolic pathways resulted in  <dig>  contigs annotated in  <dig> kegg orthologies , distributed in ‘metabolic processes’, ‘enzyme families’, ‘genetic information processing’, ‘environmental information’ ‘processing’, and ‘cellular processes’.

library divided into three main categories, “biological process”, “cellular component” and “molecular function”.

transcriptome sequencing identified the genes  of the main active pathways confirmed by kegg, covering the majority of enzymes in key processes such as ‘plant hormone signal transduction’ ; ‘plant-pathogen interaction’ ; and ‘photosynthesis’  indicating that the effort to capture a global transcriptome landscape was achieved, demonstrated by the diversity of kegg and go annotation. xia et al.   <cit>  obtained  <dig> kegg pathways, mainly distributed on ’metabolic pathways’, ‘spliceosome’, and ‘plant-pathogen interaction’, while our most enriched pathways where ‘ribosome’, ‘spliceosome’, and ‘rna transport’.

comparisons with hevea est resources
to verify the amount of new information provided by our assay, a tblastx was performed against the existing  <dig>  est sequences deposited in the ncbi public database related to hevea brasiliensis . of the  <dig>  sequences, almost half of them  found no hits with an e-value cut-off of 10- <dig>  of these  <dig>  were successfully annotated in the kegg database, on  <dig> different kegg orthologies, of which  <dig> were annotated as different enzymes belonging to metabolic pathways. also, out of the  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  were successfully annotated by searches for protein signatures on  <dig>  different interpro terms and  <dig> uniq go terms . when ranked by uniqueness   <cit>  the main biological process was the “mannose metabolic process”, for cellular components it was the “cis-golgi network” and for molecular functions “ammonium transmembrane transporter activity”.

to gain an understanding of our transcript sets, comparing our contig set  with the read set originated from triwitayakorn et al.  <cit> , we identified  <dig>  sequences with no correspondence, indicating new gene contributions from our libraries. of those,  <dig> were exclusive sequences from the rrim <dig> library and  <dig> originated from young tissues . the  <dig>  novel sequences were annotated on  <dig> go terms in three ontologies, being ‘cell part’ as the most representative on the ‘cellular component’ term, ‘metabolic process’ for the ‘biological process’ term, and ’binding’, for ‘molecular function’. of the  <dig>  new sequences identified in this study,  <dig> sequences were identified as genes related to plant cell dehydration processes. the most frequent was annotated as a heat-shock proteins /chaperones with  <dig> occurrences.

screening for est-ssr markers
for many plant species, large numbers of expressed sequence tags  have been generated although low numbers of validated est-ssr and snp markers are available for plants, especially for non-model plants. for the rubber tree, most of the available marker resources are isozyme, rflp, aflp and ssr markers  <cit> . ssr markers are today mainly obtained by a traditional method of ssr marker development, such as genomic-ssr hybrid screening and selective  amplified microsatellite enrichment  <cit> . recently, new est-ssr markers were identified and proposed by several authors from transcriptomic data  <cit> . ssrs are typically co-dominant markers, proved to be useful in assessing population structure, determining relationships between closely related species and qtl mapping. although ssr markers derived from expressed sequences are considered less informative due to dna sequence conservation in the transcribed region  <cit> , such markers are cost-effective and considered as functional sequences  <cit> .

in our work, out of the  <dig>  contigs examined, a total of  <dig>  ssrs, formed by  <dig> different motifs, were identified in  <dig>  sequences, with  <dig> contigs containing more than one ssr locus. the most frequent ssr type found was mononucleotide repeats with an average size of  <dig>  bp and 75 bp repeats as the longest . feng et al.  <cit>  searching for est-ssrs in hevea brasiliensis public databases successfully identified  <dig> loci on  <dig>  est sequences, one in every  <dig>  kb of est from the rubber tree. here, we detected a lower ssr/sequence frequency , but the total number of identified ssr loci seemed to tally between the two studies, whereas the sequence analyzed/ssr discovery ratio was  <dig> , similar to the value of  <dig>  identified by yu et al.  <cit> . the proportion of mono, di and trinucleotide repeats  was more balanced in our assay than in the yu study   <cit> . triwitayakorn et al.  <cit> , also found a lower distribution frequency  than yu et al.  <cit> , but still higher than ours. discrepancies between studies may come from differences in the methods, and the limitations of  <dig> technology when dealing with homopolymers.

screening for snv markers
out of the  <dig>  sequences obtained in this work,  <dig> contigs presented single nucleotide variants  with more than 4x coverage, an average q <dig> quality score, a minimum of  <dig> supporting reads at a position to call variants, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> substitutions per single contig. these variations accounted for a total of  <dig>  predicted biallelic snvs on a total length of  <dig>  mb of consensus sequences, corresponding to an average of one snv every  <dig>  kb. this density was less than that reported by pootakham  <cit>  in the rubber tree , probably due to the greater stringency of our snv detection parameters. most of the detected and validated nucleotide variants were transitions , with transversions only accounting for  <dig> % , which was close to pootakham’s results  <cit> . of those,  <dig> contigs presented nucleotide variation only on reads derived from the rrim <dig> library totalizing  <dig> predicted snvs for this particular library, while  <dig> contigs presented variations from consensus only on reads originating from the rrim <dig> ops library in a total of  <dig> predicted snvs .

* no cds.

out of the  <dig>  predicted snvs there were  <dig>  substitutions on cds regions  for  <dig> contigs, which resulted in  <dig>  non-synonymous substitutions on  <dig> contigs. a total of  <dig> snvs was observed on non-coding regions. of all the detected variations,  <dig>  were potential non-synonymous substitutions, accounting for 78% of all variations, indicating a high level of genetic variability.

using a similar strategy, barbazuk et al.  <cit>  screened maize ests from shoot apical meristem by  <dig> searching for snps from two inbred lines and the data were anchored onto the sequence of the maize genome. an initial number of  <dig>  putative snps was detected after the alignment of nearly  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts of both inbred lines. this figure fell to  <dig>  putative snps after post-processing. our strategy was different, using identification parameters with high stringency, allowing the prediction of only  <dig>  snvs, but with an average quality of q <dig> and a coverage ≥4x. this strategy proved effective as demonstrated by the validation of  <dig> out of  <dig> putative snps  using an allele-specific amplification strategy. similarly, barbazuk et al.  <cit>  identified variants exclusive to each inbred maize line and polymorphic sites with a different depth by inbred line. the validation of a subset of snps by pcr amplification and sanger sequencing revealed a validation rate over 85%. these data suggest that the computationally identified snvs represented ‘true’ polymorphisms even for low ests-coverage regions, suggesting that 454-based transcriptome sequencing is an excellent method for the high-throughput acquisition of gene-associated snps. in the same way, novaes et al.  <cit>  studying multiple tissues and genotypes of eucalyptus grandis, a non-model plant, on a  <dig> platform, sequenced and assembled  <dig> mbp ests from  <dig> , <dig> reads identifying  <dig>  snps, of which 83% were validated by sanger sequencing in a sample of  <dig> snps.

from our data, non-synonymous snvs accounted for 64%  of overall variations occurring in cds regions. for non-synonymous changes it is not possible to directly determine how much the amino acid change will affect the protein structure, stability or localization. in eukaryotes, changes in the protein isoelectric point  may directly influence the localization and reactions of proteins, and it is reasonable to assume that alterations to the global protein ip may interfere in interactions between proteins and complexes. alendé et al.  <cit> , studying the evolution of ip over mammalian proteins, showed that insertions/deletions were the main reason for the shift in ip and suggested that shifts in ip might be related to the gain in additional activities, such as new interacting partners or preferences for orthologous or isoforms.

from the calculated ip and molecular weight  for the mutated and non-mutated contigs that displayed non-synonymous mutation, the variation in ip ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig> , and the mw from - <dig>  kda to  <dig>  kda. a major alteration in ip was observed on a conserved hypothetical protein from ricinus communis  annotated as a ricinus communis conserved hypothetical protein, and  <dig>  ip variation over the non-consensus sequence annotated as glycotransferase activity , keeg  glycan biosynthesis. the characterization of mw and ip for the protein sequences translated from contigs with non-synonymous mutation showed that the mw from the mutated sequences was altered, but  <dig> sequences did not demonstrate any changes in ip values. flegr  <cit>  suggested that, since cell cytoplasm ph is stratified ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in eukaryotes, changes in the protein isoelectric point may directly influence the localization and reactions of proteins, and it is reasonable to assume that alterations to the global protein ip may interfere in interactions between proteins and complexes.

substitutions outside coding regions  are often linked to gene regulatory regions and may affect events, such as gene splicing, messenger rna degradation or non-coding rna sequences, and therefore usually called esnp/v , therefore becoming an interesting feature for biotechnological uses. here, we were able to identify  <dig>  mutations associated with  <dig> contigs. the results obtained by barbazuk et al.  <cit>  and novaes et al.  <cit>  gave sufficient evidence about the reliability of the  <dig> sequencing platform for snv identification in transcriptomic data, constituting an important feature for  <dig> data analysis.

analysis of genetic diversity
out of a set of  <dig> snvs detected in silico,  <dig> snps were shown to be polymorphic among the  <dig> tested hevea genotypes belonging to  <dig> species and resulting from different breeding programs . pic ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and heterozygosity varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . ten snps displayed the same heterozygous combination for all the genotypes and were not included in the analysis of genetic diversity.

the tree , obtained from a dissimilarity matrix computed from allelic data of the  <dig> markers for each variety, gave a representation generally in accordance with the pedigree analysis . the three genotypes which did not belong to the h. brasiliensis species , were grouped together and were clearly distinct from most other h. brasiliensis genotypes, as reported by feng et al.  <cit>  using  <dig> est-ssr markers. irca <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig> genotypes, presenting a common ancestral parent , were well located on the same branch. irca <dig> and pb <dig> genotypes bred from the same ancestral parents were positioned on close branches. even more clearly, cmb <dig> and cmb <dig>  two full-sib genotypes, were localized at a quite a similar distance from their parents irca <dig> and pfb <dig>  pr <dig> and its progeny pr <dig> were located on the same branch.

it is the first time that a large number of snps have been developed in hevea after the publication by pootakham et al  <cit>  of  <dig> snps. the result indicates that these  <dig> snps would be useful for rubber tree genetics and breeding studies. being heterozygous for at least one of the parents of recently published hevea genetic maps, most of these snps could easily contribute in the near future to enhancing the density of these ssr-based genetic maps:  <dig> snps could be mapped in the pb <dig> x fx <dig> map  <cit> ,  <dig> snps in the pr <dig> x pb <dig> map  <cit> ,  <dig> snp in the pb <dig> x fx <dig> map  <cit>  and  <dig> snps in the pb <dig> x mdf <dig> map  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first hevea brasiliensis transcriptome release covering the main tissues extracted from both clonal plant materials and derived hybrid plant materials obtained by open-pollination, and the first to investigate and analyze hevea brasiliensis snvs. the results of similarity identification, diversity of transcript localization, and variety of predicted functions from the  <dig>  contigs obtained by our study, associated with the variety of tissues sampled demonstrate a cohesive approach to capturing the transcriptional landscape of whole rubber tree physiology.

moreover, the public availability of the sequences, functional annotation and the global variant analysis, as well as the sequencing of raw data to be released from this study will provide a source of valuable information for biotechnology assays and genetic improvement of rubber trees, an addition to be used for a reference transcriptome for further sequencing projects.

as an allogamous plant with a recent history of selection, most of hevea genotypes are highly heterozygous, opening the way for the development of a huge number of snp markers.
