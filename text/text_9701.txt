BACKGROUND
how genes are structurally organized and functionally evolved are two fundamental biological questions to be addressed across diverse evolutionary lineages. the best known example for structurally-coordinated and functionally-related genes are operons in prokaryotes  <cit> . in eukaryotes, certain classes of genes are also non-randomly distributed, forming different structural classes including pairing and clustering. for instance, genes within the same metabolic pathways are often clustered together  <cit>  and have correlated expression patterns when compared against random genes  <cit> .

recently, there have been increasing numbers of genome-wide studies on divergently-paired genes or dpgs in human  <cit>  and drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . dpgs are often defined as two adjacent genes that are divergently transcribed on opposite dna strands, which have transcription start sites  less than  <dig>  bp apart  <cit> . the sequences between the two tsss among dpgs are defined as divergently-shared promoters . more than 10% of the human genes are arranged in the divergent organization, and dpgs are often co-ordinately expressed with evolutionary conservation and functional association  <cit> .

among species as diverse as human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , chicken  <cit> , fruit fly  <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , and aspergillus nidulans  <cit> , a substantial number of individual dpgs have been reported based on experimental evidence but few genome-wide analysis across diverse evolutionary lineages has been published. the recent availability of genome sequences of d. melanogaster  and a constellation of closely-related species at various levels of divergence time selected in the genus drosophila have made the genus an ideal model for a thorough comparative analysis for dpgs .

we performed a genome-wide identification of dpgs in dmel and other selected eukaryotic genomes, including representatives from vertebrate and other sequenced drosophila species. we also examined the conservation of divergent gene organization over different evolutionary time scales using orthologous sequence datasets based on synonymous  and nonsynonymous  substitution rates. we also correlated gene expression and functional relevance among dpgs of dmel and other eukaryotes based on gene ontology terms. our results suggested that the divergent gene organization is a widespread and evolutionary conserved feature of co-regulated transcription for functionally-related genes in drosophila genomes albeit variable patterns observed among different taxonomic groups or lineages in terms of structural conservation.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of dpgs in dmel and other eukaryotes
we determined  <dig>  dpgs  from  <dig>  annotated dmel genes, accounted for  <dig> % of the total . the majority  of the sequences between tsss of these dpgs are less than  <dig> bp in length with the majority ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length . since there is a possibility where a gene overlaps with two dpgs simultaneously when gene density is high enough, we also extracted multiple dpgs . of the  <dig>  total, only  <dig> pairs  were found overlapping at the 5'ends, whereas  <dig>  pairs  are non-overlapping. in addition, we determined that  <dig>  dpgs are tandem duplicates .

we also characterized dpgs among other eukaryotic genomes . the majority of these dpgs have tss distance s from <dig> to  <dig> bp among dmel and vertebrates . in addition, vertebrates have a relatively higher proportion of dpgs with overlapping sequences. the proportions of dpgs among other eukaryotes ranged from 6% to55% in densities so that the divergent gene organization is widespread among eukaryotic genomes. although the relationship between gene density and the proportion of divergent genes are observed as somewhat linearly correlated  among certain lower eukaryotes, the drosophila species as well as the vertebrates showed different proportions of dpgs ; insects appear to have higher proportions as compared to those of the vertebrates .

the evolution of dpgs
although the conservation of gene organization in an evolutionary context must have functional relevance  <cit> , we are not convinced that the degree of conservation is universal among different animal lineages. we selected three groups of species pairs with comparable divergence time to examine the difference in the divergent organization between insects and vertebrates  <cit> , and defined dpgs into five different groups based on their degrees of evolutionary conservation . first, among the insect genomes studied, the gene pairs in the categories of dpgs with orthologs, convergently-paired genes  with orthologs, and co-directionally-paired genes  with orthologs are all abundant and at the same magnitude as compared to the corresponding fully-conserved category of gene pairs in insects  and vertebrates . second, the proportions of fully-conserved dpgs, cpgs, and cdpgs are all present at lower level as compared to those gene pairs with orthologs. the reduced abundance suggests relatively poorer conservation and greater dynamics, especially when their functional relevance is considered. third, among the paired genes with orthologs, there are more than twice as many cdpgs as dpgs and cpgs, and cdpgs seem better conserved than the other two categories among insects. fourth, among the vertebrate genomes analyzed, the fully-conserved dpgs, cpgs, and cdpgs remain at the same magnitude as the paired genes with orthologs, in sharp contrast with those found in insects. this observation suggests that the fully-conserved vertebrate dpgs are more conservative than those of insects. fifth, among the vertebrates, cdpgs are much less abundant, less than half of the other two groups of genes, dpgs and cpgs .

to investigate when the enrichment of dpgs was evolved among different species, we selected dmel and human as models for a comparative analysis with regards to the short-term and long-term evolutions. there is little difference in the numbers of fully-conserved dpgs between dmel and other drosophila genomes . however, there is a clear divide in dpgs between vertebrates and other eukaryotes; there are significantly more fully-conserved dpgs in the vertebrate lineage, especially among mammals . the result suggested that most of the human dpgs might arise after the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes. alternatively, the conserved organizational features in the vertebrate lineage indicated that mechanistic differences might have evolved in the vertebrate lineage whereas dpgs in insects as well as the other two gene organizational structures, cpgs and cdpgs, are more dynamic or relatively less conserved. we also compared the percentage of dpgs with that of the randomly gene pairs in the fully-conserved category. we found that the occurrence of dpgs is significantly higher than that of the control in both insect  and human genomes . the result indicated that the generation of dpgs is not due to random events but selected along species evolution.

dpgs are under stronger purifying selection
the conservation of gene organization could be explained by purifying selection  that refers to selection against nonsynonymous substitutions of protein-coding sequences. in this case, the evolutionary distance based on synonymous substitutions is expected to be greater than the distance based on nonsynonymous substitutions. we evaluated the rate s of nucleotide substitutions at synonymous  and nonsynonymous  sites for orthologs of both dpgs and non-divergently paired genes between dmel and d. pseudoobscura for insects  and between human and mouse for vertebrates . in insects, the nonsynonymous substitution rate, ka, is very similar between dpgs and the non-divergent gene sets. however, there is a significant difference in the synonymous substitution rate: the ks values for dpgs are greater than those for the non-divergent genes. furthermore, ka/ks ratios for dpgs are also significantly less than those for the non-divergent genes. in vertebrates, the ka and ks values for dpgs are both significantly less than those for the non-divergent genes, and the result implies that there are much fewer dna substitutions happened in dpgs than in the non-divergent genes. moreover, ka/ks ratios for dpgs are also significantly less than those for the non-divergent genes. these results suggested that dpgs are subjected to greater purifying selection than non-divergent genes. although the negative selection of dpgs may not be directly attributable to the maintenance of their organizational characteristics, it represents a collective effect of both structural and functional importance.

co-expression of dpgs in d. melanogaster
it has long been known that transcriptional regulation is related to chromosomal structures and epigenetic controls. neighbouring gene pairs are more likely to co-express than random gene pairs  <cit> . furthermore, dpgs showed significant expression correlation than other types of consecutive gene pairs in human  <cit> , fruit fly  <cit> , and prokaryotes  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we related dpgs to three microarray datasets for expression analysis . we mapped  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  gene pairs with available microarray data in degregorio <dig>  arbeitman <dig>  and spellman <dig> dataset, respectively. we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient for all dpgs for each dataset independently, and found that the expression of dpgs is positively correlated better than cdpgs, cpgs, and random gene pairs in all three microarray datasets .

we also evaluated the significance of each correlation for all datasets. we denoted a correlation as a significant correlation when its p-value <  <dig> , in which a significant positive correlation if the correlation is positive, otherwise a significant negative correlation. of total  <dig>  dpgs with available microarray data,  <dig>   and  <dig>  pairs showed significant positive and negative correlations respectively, which have p <  <dig>  at least in one dataset. moreover, there were  <dig>  pairs showed either significant positive or negative correlations depending on conditions of microarray experiments .

the fact that the overall  <dig> % of all dpgs are significant correlated with expression implies co-regulation as the driving force for maintaining this gene organization. in addition, the relationship between the intergenic distance of dpgs and the level of co-expression are not correlated as shown previously in human  <cit> .

functional classification of dpgs
previous studies have shown that many dna repair genes are dpgs in human genome  <cit> . to observe the functional classification of dpgs in dmel, we analyzed their annotations and included six other eukaryotic genomes, h. sapiens, m. musculus, g. gallus, c. elegans, s. cerevisiae, and a. thaliana for comparison . in biological process, the go terms related to organization/biogenesis and metabolic/biosynthetic processes topped the list of dpgs. the go terms involved in rna binding are significantly overrepresented as compared to others in molecular function. from the results of cellular component, we found that dpgs tend to be in the classes of intracellular, organelle, cytoplasm, and protein complex. however, almost 80% of the overrepresented go terms in human and mouse are identical due to their close evolutionary distance. above 90% of the terms in chicken are also present in human genome, but the total number of the overrepresented go terms is less than human partly because of the rarity of go annotations and less number of genes in the chicken genome. the dmel dpgs had the most overrepresented go terms among the eukaryotes accounted for the highest proportion of dpgs relative to gene density. almost all terms found in human genome are also present in dmel genome. furthermore, every species has its own specific go annotations, suggesting that some dpgs of different species may evolve independently during evolution. for instance, c. elegans has distinct overrepresented go terms in biological process, including reproduction, behaviour, growth and development. the terms thylakoid, plastid, and triplet codon-amino acid adaptor activity in a. thaliana represent characteristics of plants that are different from those highlighted among animals. in dmel, there were relatively more specific go terms than other eukaryotes, including transport, cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis, cell death and cell proliferation in biological process, nuclear envelope, cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicle in cellular component, chromatin binding, motor activity, actin binding, kinase activity, cytoskeletal protein binding, enzyme regulator activity, and transcription regulator activity in molecular function.

we evaluated functional similarities for annotated dmel dpgs using the resnik semantic measure  <cit> . the functional similarities of dpgs were significantly larger than random gene pairs confirmed with kolmogorov-smirnov test . the p-values of these tests are  <dig> e- <dig> for molecular function and less than 1e- <dig> for biological process and cellular component. these results indicated that the functions of dpgs are significantly different from random gene pairs and strongly biased toward functional similarities.

it has been reported that among prokaryotes there is a strong enrichment of dpgs in which one gene encodes a transcriptional regulator  and the other encodes other protein classes   <cit> . this suggests potential regulatory interactions among dpgs. for the dmel dpgs, we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   pairs for rx, rr, and xx structures, respectively. however, in the control set with  <dig>  random gene pairs, we found  <dig>  ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   pairs for rx, rr, and xx structures, respectively. since p-values based on fisher's exact test are  <dig> e- <dig> for rx,  <dig> e- <dig> for rr, and  <dig>  for xx, rx and rr structures are more likely to present in dpgs. of the  <dig> dpgs with rx structure,  <dig> pairs  are fully-conserved across at least seven drosophila clades. furthermore, as a fraction of dpgs classified as xx may in fact play role as post-transcriptional regulators and some poorly annotated  genes classified as x, rx structure should be more enriched in dpgs.

analysis of the promoter sequences among dpgs
previous studies on human genome have shown evidence that the majority of rna polymerase ii-transcribed genes with bidirectional promoters have a cpg island between them <cit>  and the promoters of dpgs have a higher median gc-content than non-divergent promoters  <cit> . for dmel, the median gc-content of divergent promoters is37%, significantly less than the median value 50% of non-divergent promoters . the contradictory result mainly stemmed from the genome gc-content difference of the two species. t he majority of mammalian promoters are associated with cpg islands that do not exist in many other species because of the absence of dna methylation, including drosophila. we evaluated the average nucleotide composition around the tsss of divergent and non-divergent genes in dmel. the nucleotide frequency of non-divergent genes demonstrated the presence of tata-box and absence of dpgs . it is consistent with the result from an analysis on human dpgs <cit> .

there are four core promoter elements that have been experimentally identified among drosophila promoters: tata box, initiator , downstream promoter element , and motif ten element   <cit> . we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes with at least one count of the four core promoter elements in dpgs and non-divergent genes, respectively . according to fisher's exact test, we learnt that tata-box, dpe, and mte are significantly less than expected at a cut-off of p <  <dig> , but there is not a single core promoter element dominating in dpgs. as core promoter elements usually work in cooperation, we chose to analyze combinations of core promoter elements utilized by dpgs, and found that the inr-dpe pair showed significantly greater value than the expected .

discussion
the limitation in defining dpgs based on shared distance
we determined dpgs based on the criterion that the two transcriptional start sites should be found in the opposite orientation and less than  <dig>  bp apart so the gene pair has a greater possibility to be functionally correlated by sharing a common regulatory region. however, a recent study on human cyp1a <dig> and cyp1a <dig> genes  <cit>  has shown that they are simultaneously controlled through bidirectional and common regulatory elements, but separated by  <dig> kb intergenic spacer region, suggesting that the number of dpgs are underestimated by current standard. obviously, some of the true dpgs that are distantly situated are to be mapped experimentally in the future, perhaps coupled with the next-generation sequencing technology. fortunately, the abundance of dpgs overcomes this obvious limitation for characteristic analysis unless individual genes are scrutinized.

the conservation and origin of divergent gene organization
we found that the human dpgs and their corresponding orthologs are conserved only among vertebrates, especially among mammals. similarly, the dpg orthologs of other species, such as those of insects, are also better conserved among their close relatives as compared to random genes. these observations support the idea that dpgs provide structural advantages for co-regulation so they become conserved when functionally important genes  become divergently organized. this hypothesis is further supported by the abundance of species-specific dpgs observed. for instance, human dpgs have strong association with cpg islands that are specifically related to genome compositional dynamics and evolution of mammalian genomes. in addition, some of the dpgs may be associated with species specific functions as dpgs in c. elegans are significantly associated with reproduction, behaviour, growth, and development related functions. the go terms thylakoid, plastid, and triplet codon-amino acid adaptor activity in a. thaliana represent the characteristics of plants different from that of animals.

the conservation patterns of the divergent gene organization differ among different lineages, such as between insects and vertebrates. a majority of dpgs with orthologs of insect genomes are diminishing faster over evolutionary time scales but not those of vertebrates. we believe that the organizational priorities for the insect and vertebrate lineages are different strategically as insect species tend to be more diversified to adapt different environments and ecological relationships when compared to vertebrates that gain complex in terms of anatomical structures and behaviours over time.

the origin of dpgs has been of great interest since more and more individual divergent gene pairs have been identified experimentally and several hypotheses have been proposed to illustrate the molecular mechanisms as to how the architecture is created. the first argues for tandem duplication. tandem duplicated genes refer to two gene s reside physically adjacent to each other, often in the same orientation, and usually have similar expression patterns and similar in function, if not identical. tandem duplication is a common event among eukaryotic genomes, which is a primary mechanism for generating gene clusters. genome analysis suggests that one copy of a duplicated gene could drift and potentially acquire a new function. for example, several odorant-binding proteins in drosophila are transcribed in opposite directions  <cit> . nevertheless, our analysis showed that only  <dig> % of all the divergent gene pairs were tandem duplicates, suggesting that tandem duplication might not be the essential driving force. the second hypothesis is overprinting, which is a process of generating new genes from pre-existing nucleotide sequences  <cit> . for a divergent gene pair, one is often confined to a single lineage, but the other is widespread. for example, the two human genes sirt <dig> and psmd <dig>  are linked in divergent configuration sharing regulatory mechanism  <cit> . one of them, sirt <dig>  only has orthologs in vertebrates, and the other, psmd <dig>  is found in all genomes examined in this study. it is assumed that the evolution of their divergent arrangements is associated with that of a complex pathway of co-regulation related to aging in vertebrates. thus, psmd <dig> represents an old gene widespread among eukaryotes but sirt3is a vertebrate invention. the third theory is genome rearrangement. a genome rearrangement occurs when a chromosome breaks at two or more locations and reassembled in to a different orientation. this results in a dna sequence that has essentially the same features as the original sequence, except that the order of these features has been modified. a possible scenario to explain the origin of dpgs is that this gene organization originated by chance via genome rearrangement. when a genome rearrangement brought two distant genes together and formed a divergent gene pair, there was no distinct functional relationship at the beginning. however, the promoter region shared by both genes was maintained by evolutionary pressure. a mutation in this region would be potentially hazardous, resulting in failure in normal expression for both genes. both genes may have housekeeping roles and any one of them would be vital to survival. in the process of evolution, genome took advantage of such a gene organization and utilized it for transcriptional regulation. regulation of gene expression by forming dpgs may result in more efficient control an d reduce the need for more complex regulatory pathways.

the features of dsps in eukaryotes
in general, the transcription of each gene in a eukaryotic genome is controlled independently and operons are unusual in eukaryotes, as opposed to most prokaryotes  <cit> . the organization of dsps in dpgs does not exhibit universal structural features, because there have not been consistent sequence motifs found among them. as far as we know, promoters recognized by rna polymerase ii are divided into two broad categories: tata-containing and tata-less promoters. tissue-specific genes typically contain tata boxes located ~30-bp upstream of a single tss.

tissue-specific transcriptional factors generally bind upstream of a tata box and either activate or repress promoter activities. the promoters of housekeeping genes do not generally contain tata box sequences and usually display multiple transcription start sites. housekeeping promoters are active in most cell types and often contain binding sites for ubiquitous transcription factors. many of the human dsps that have been studied so far are tata-less  <cit>  and associated with genes for housekeeping functions. examples include dsps of the genes encoding dhfr/rep- <dig>  <cit> , tk/kf  <cit> , surf1/surf <dig>  <cit> , gpat/airc <cit> , histones h2a/h2b <cit>  and brca1/nbr <dig>  <cit> . although a few dsps have tata boxes in both orientations <cit> , most lack tata boxes and initiator elements in either direction and stimulate transcriptional initiation at multiple sites over broad initiation windows as a strong association between dpgs and cpg island is described in human genome  <cit> . the mammalian dsps with cpg island are frequently lack of tata boxes  <cit> . nevertheless, cpg islands appear less frequently found in promoters that contain both tata boxes and initiator regions  <cit> . it is clear that a majority of dpgs in human are co-regulated by tata-less promoters with cpg-islands and sp <dig> binding site is prevalent in dsps  <cit> . furthermore, some other transcriptional factor binding sites may also play key roles in regulating certain dpgs. examples include: yy <dig> factor binding site in surf1/surf <dig> genes  <cit> ,  ccaat box binding sites for hsf- <dig> /bop <dig> <cit> , e14/atm <cit> , brca1/nbr <dig> <cit> , and gpat/airc  <cit> , gc boxes between the tsss of tap1/lmp <dig> <cit> , dhfr/rep- <dig>  <cit> and gpat/airc <cit> , and e2f factor binding site in tk/kf genes  <cit> .

our analysis for dmel genome indicated that dpgs often have tata-less promoters, consistent with the finding in human. however, cpg island is not an indicator for dsps in dmel as dna methylation is known to be absent in this organism. in this study, we focused on four common core promoter elements experimentally identified: tata box, inr, dpe, and mte. tata box and inr are well-known in drosophila and vertebrates. the core motif of dpe is located exactly from + <dig> to + <dig> bp downstream of tss and is recognized by two distinct tbp-associated factors . experimental evidence suggests that dpe appears to be as widely used as tata box  <cit> . mte is located at positions from + <dig> to + <dig> bp, experimentally verified to interact with tfiid  <cit> . these core promoter elements show organism-specific patterns; inr has higher information content, and dpe is much more frequently found in the fly promoters as compared to those among mammals  <cit> . the diversity of core promoters are thought to contribute to specificity of gene regulation in a combinatorial fashion  <cit> . although the distribution of the four core promoter elements indicated that there has not been a single element overrepresented among dpgs, a significant overrepresentation was found in a combination of inr and dpe, which is functionally equivalent to cpg islands in mammalian dpgs.

CONCLUSIONS
dpgs exist as one of the common structural features of genomes and provide advantages in transcriptional co-regulation. dpgs are abundant among eukaryotic genomes and highly conserved; the conservation is stronger within lineages than between lineages. the conservation patterns among the different organizational classes, i.e. dpgs, cpgs, and cdpgs, appear linage-specific as vertebrate dpgs are better conserved than those of insects. further analyses revealed that dpgs are strongly co-regulated in expression profiles and associated with certain functional categories. dpgs are mostly housekeeping genes so they lack tata box. combinations of transcriptional factor binding sites are crucial in regulating this divergent gene organization.
