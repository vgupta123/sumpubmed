BACKGROUND
more than  <dig> leishmania species are pathogenic to humans and cause leishmaniasis of differing severity. leishmania amazonensis , the parasite studied in this work, is common in brazil and causes a wide spectrum of clinical leishmaniasis  <cit> . the parasite can cause opportunistic infections in hiv/aids patients and co-infections have been reported in  <dig> countries. there are no adequate methods for controlling leishmaniasis and current available treatments are inefficient  <cit> . consequently, most of the ongoing research for new drugs to combat the disease is based on post-genomic approaches  <cit> .

telomeres are specialized structures at the end of chromosomes and consist of stretches of repetitive dna  and associated proteins  <cit> . telomeres are essential for maintaining genome stability and cell viability, with dysfunctional telomeres triggering a classic dna-damage response that enables double-strand breaks and cell cycle arrest  <cit> .

there are three classes of telomeric proteins, viz., proteins that bind specifically to single-stranded g-rich dna, proteins that bind to double-stranded dna and proteins that interact with telomeric factors. other non-telomeric proteins, such as the dna repair proteins mre <dig> and rad <dig>  also play important roles at telomeres  <cit> . in mammals and yeast, telomeric proteins are organized in high order protein complexes known as shelterin or telosome that cap chromosome ends and protect them from fusion or degradation by dna-repair processes  <cit> . these complexes, which are abundant at chromosome ends but do not accumulate elsewhere, are present at telomeres throughout the cell cycle and their action is limited to telomeres  <cit> . shelterin/telosome proteins include members or functional homologues of the trf  or telobox protein family, such as trf <dig> and trf <dig> from mammals  <cit>  and tebp <dig>  <cit> , taz <dig>  <cit>  and tbf <dig>  <cit>  from yeast. all of these proteins bind double-strand telomeres via a myb-like dna-binding domain, which is one of the features that characterize proteins that preferentially bind double-stranded telomeric dna  <cit> .

in humans, trf <dig> may control the length of telomeric repeats through various mechanisms. for example, trf <dig> can control telomerase access through its interaction with tin <dig>  ptop/pip <dig> and the single-stranded telomeric dna-binding protein pot <dig>  trf <dig> may also regulates telomerase activity by interacting with pinx <dig>  a natural telomerase inhibitor. in comparison, trf <dig> is involved in many functions, including the assembly of the terminal t-loop, negative telomere length regulation and chromosome end protection  <cit> . the shelterin complex is anchored along the length of telomeres by both trf <dig> and trf <dig>  <cit> , whereas in conjunction with pot <dig>  trf <dig> is thought to stimulate wrn and blm helicases to dissociate unusual structures during telomeric replication  <cit> . trf <dig> also interacts with enzymes that control g-tail formation, the nucleases xpf1-ercc <dig>  the mre11-rad50-nbs <dig>  complex, the recq helicase wrn and the 5' exonuclease apollo  <cit> . loss of trf <dig> leads to nhej-mediated chromosome end-fusion and the accumulation of factors that form the so-called telomere dysfunction-induced foci   <cit> . thus, trf <dig> can modulate the activity of several enzymes and influence the conformation of telomeric dna.

only a few telomeric proteins that bind the double-stranded form of telomeric dna have been described in leishmania and in their trypanosome counterparts  <cit> . homologues of human trf have been found in the genomes of t. brucei, t. cruzi and l. major based on sequence similarities to the c-terminal myb-like dna binding domain. for example, the t. brucei trf <dig> homologue known as tbtrf shares a similar telomere end-protection function with vertebrate trf <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
characterization of the putative l. amazonensis trf gene homologue
using data mining via the omniblast server we searched the whole l. major genome database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/parasites/leish.html for a putative sequence that shared similarities with the vertebrate trf <dig> and trf <dig> proteins. for this search, we used the most conserved part of both human proteins, the c-terminal fragment containing the myb-like dna binding domain. the search returned a single sequence  that encoded a hypothetical protein , the c-terminus of which shared ~30% identity and 50-55% similarity with the vertebrate trf myb-like domain, according to the blast <dig> sequence analysis .

based on the l. major sequence, primers were designed for pcr amplification of the entire homologous sequence from l. amazonensis with genomic dna as the template. pcr products of  <dig>  bp were cloned into the vector pcr <dig>  and both insert strands were sequenced . the deduced polypeptide sequence of  <dig> amino acid residues contained a putative c-terminal myb-like dna binding domain between residues 684- <dig>  according to psi-blast . the latrf gene  shared high sequence identity and similarity to the putative l. major trf, and to hypothetical l. infantum and l. braziliensis trfs . the sequence conservation between latrf and the trypanosome tbtrf and the putative tctrf homologues decreased to 35-45% identity , consistent with the known evolutionary relationships among these organisms. the leishmania trf homologues encode the largest trf protein  described so far. the fact that the leishmania proteins showed much greater homology with each other than with other protozoan proteins and that they are the largest trf described so far resembles the situation for leishmania telomerase protein  <cit> .

la, l. amazonensis ; lm, l. major ; li, l. infantum ; lb, l. brasiliensis ; tc, trypanosoma cruzi ; tb, trypanosoma brucei ; h, human .

in addition, like tbtrf, latrf shared sequence similarities with the canonical myb-like domain and with the trfh dimerization domain of human trf <dig> and trf <dig> , but no sequence similarities were found with any other telobox protein . together, these results indicate that although latrf shares high sequence similarity with tbtrf, probably because the two species are phylogenetically related  <cit> , further studies are required to confer any functions to the leishmania trf homologue identified here.

latrf is a nuclear protein that co-localizes with l. amazonensis telomeres
in exponentially growing l. amazonensis promastigotes, latrf was detected only in nuclear protein extracts. a single ~ <dig>  kda protein band was detected using anti-latrf serum . no protein was detected in cytoplasmic and total protein extracts , indicating that latrf is a nuclear protein with very low intracellular abundance. as a control, western blots were revealed with anti-larpa- <dig> serum, which recognizes a ~ <dig>  kda telomeric protein band  <cit>   and also its phosphorylated forms .

we also developed an immunofluorescence assay combined with fish, using anti-latrf serum and a pna-telomere probe specific for ttaggg repeats. as shown in fig  <dig> , latrf is a nuclear protein that partially co-localizes with parasites telomeres, since some of the latrf signal coincided with telomeric foci and some did not . in most cells, latrf appears as a diffuse signal spread all over the nucleoplasm and only in some cases it forms large punctuated foci, which seems to co-localize with the telomeric dna . similarly, in humans, the htrf <dig> protein also appears in the form of punctuate foci that does not completely associate with telomeres  <cit> , which is in agreement with other cellular functions played by this protein  <cit> . in contrast, the t. brucei trf protein  appears to co-localize with most telomeres at all stages of the cell cycle in both bloodstream and procyclic forms  <cit> . whether latrf also has other cellular roles or if its association with telomeres occurs in a cell cycle dependent manner is not clear at this stage.

latrf interacts in vitro and in vivo with l. amazonensis telomeres using a myb-like dna binding domain
emsa assays were done with renatured protein extracts containing full length latrf, the myb-like dna binding domain   and with l. amazonensis nuclear extracts , to investigate whether latrf, like its vertebrate and trypanosome counterparts  <cit> , was able to bind double-stranded telomeric dna in vitro.

the full-length recombinant protein and its deletion mutant were expressed in very low amounts and in non-soluble form in the e. coli system  making their purification by conventional chromatography very difficult. therefore, protein expression was checked by western blot using anti-latrf serum and anti-his tag monoclonal antibody .

as shown in fig  <dig>  recombinant full length latrf and the mutant bearing only the c-terminal myb-domain were able to bind specifically the double-stranded telomeric dna . competition assays showed that the complexes formed by both recombinant proteins were completely abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled latel and that there was no competition for binding when excess of non-specific poly   double-stranded dna was used . supershift assay with anti-latrf serum, which recognizes a n-terminal epitope in the protein, confirmed that full length latrf forms a robust complex with labeled latel , possibly because the binding of anti-latrf stabilized the latrf-latel complex, blocking the action of other non-specific binding activity in the extract. when competitors were added to the supershift reactions with anti-latrf serum, the binding specificity of recombinant latrf for latel was confirmed . the complex was almost totally abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled latel  and no competition was detected in the presence of non-specific dna . the results presented above suggest that recombinant latrf binds latel potentially via the putative myb-like dna binding domain indicating a role for the c-terminal region of latrf in mediating sequence-specific binding to telomeric dna.

nuclear extracts were obtained from log phase l. amazonensis promastigotes in order to check if native latrf was also able to bind double-stranded telomeric dna  in vitro, . the results showed the presence of latrf activity in these extracts, as part of the complex formed with the nuclear proteins and latel  was supershifted by the anti-latrf serum . in addition, competition assays showed that this complex was unaffected by excess of poly   , used as the non-specific competitor, but it was almost completely abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled latel . supershift experiments using anti-latrf serum were done in the presence of competitor to confirm that latrf was actually involved in the formation of the retarded band . note that the retarded shifted band disappeared due to the competition by non-labeled latel. thus, these results indicate that latrf is in part responsible for the binding activity shown in these extracts and is probably a component of the leishmania telomeric complex.

chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also suggested that latrf is a telomeric protein. the anti-latrf serum immunoprecipitated l. amazonensis telomeric dna  in vivo  but did not immunoprecipitate the gt-rich kinetoplast dna  . the kdna control represented by the ums  albeit gt-rich, is very representative of the general base composition of leishmania genomic dna. in addition, it is a good control, since we were able to show that it was co-immunoprecipitated by two other leishmania telomeric protein  <cit> . in a previous study, we described latbp <dig>  a protein that specifically binds telomeric and gt-rich dna in leishmania. latbp <dig> has a centrally positioned myb-like dna binding domain and is most likely a non-telobox protein that is apparently related to the multifunctional yeast rap <dig> telomeric protein and tfiiib b" transcription factor  <cit> . together with the putative latrf described here, these are the only descriptions of proteins bearing a myb-like dna binding domain that interact with double-stranded telomeric dna in leishmania.

as mentioned here and elsewhere  <cit> , the huge evolutionary distance between this protozoan and higher eukaryotes presents a barrier when searching for protein homologues in the genomes of these parasites. for example, no trf <dig> homologues were found in trypanosomatid genomes but the expression of htrf <dig> in procyclic forms of t. brucei caused telomere shortening and cell cycle arrest, probably by displacing an unknown endogenous telomeric factor  <cit> . rnai knockdown of tbtrf arrested bloodstream cells in g2/m and most of the procyclic cells in the s phase, and caused shortening of g-rich single-stranded telomeric dna. these findings suggest that tbtrf is probably the unknown endogenous telomeric factor, which resembles the function of mammalian trf <dig> at parasite telomeres  <cit> . the functions of latrf at leishmania telomeres remain to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we describe the characterization of the leishmania trf homologue and show that it is the largest trf protein homologue described so far. this protein contains a canonical c-terminal myb-like dna binding domain as well as a putative and less conserved trfh dimerization domain  <cit> . in addition, latrf is expressed exclusively in the nucleus and like its vertebrate and trypanosome counterparts, binds to parasite telomeres in vitro and in vivo. it can also co-localize with parasite telomeres, despite being spread all over the nucleoplasm in most cells, suggesting that latrf may play additional cellular roles beyond its possible telomeric function.
