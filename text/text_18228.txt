BACKGROUND
photoreceptors are specialised sensory neurons that enable images of the external environment to be captured. structurally, cone and rod photoreceptors appear grossly similar. both have outer segments rich in photosensitive membranes, inner segments rich in transport and metabolic machinery, and synaptic termini that chemically transmit light signals to downstream neurons  <cit> . however, cone and rod photoreceptors function distinctly. rods are specialised to function in low-light, whereas cones enable colour vision and visual acuity  <cit> . these functional differences are partly explained by the distinct morphological specialisations of outer segments and synaptic termini present in rods or cones  <cit> . in addition, unique transcripts encode rod- or cone-specific components of the g-protein coupled receptor phototransduction pathway. this includes the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric g-protein transducin  encoded by gnat <dig> in rods and by gnat <dig> in cones. underlining these molecular differences, these photoreceptor-specific isoforms associate with distinct forms of blindness. mutations in the gene encoding rod transducin alpha  cause inherited night blindness whereas mutations in the gene encoding cone transducin alpha  cause achromatopsia, or total colour blindness  <cit> .

during retinal neurogenesis, rod and cone photoreceptors differentiate from a population of retinal progenitor cells  <cit> . in  <dig> day post-fertilisation  zebrafish, post-mitotic cells that will differentiate into photoreceptors are visible, and transcripts for phototransduction genes can be detected  <cit> . outer segments and synaptic ribbons, unique morphological specialisations of differentiated photoreceptors, are apparent by  <dig> dpf  <cit> . in zebrafish, visual behaviour assays indicate that functional photoreceptors are present in some larvae at  <dig> dpf, and that robust responses have developed in all wildtype larvae by 4- <dig> dpf  <cit> . electroretinography reveals that cones are the primary functional photoreceptors at  <dig> dpf and that rods become functional later at 15- <dig> dpf  <cit> .

underpinning the morphological and functional development of photoreceptors is a programme of regulated gene transcription. however, relatively little is known about the cis transcriptional regulators that initiate cone photoreceptor-specific expression in vivo. in the canine retina, a  <dig>  kb promoter fragment from the human red opsin gene directs reporter expression in long and medium  wavelength cones and has been applied in proof-of-principle gene therapy studies for inherited achromatopsia  <cit> . although a shorter  <dig>  kb fragment is inactive, the addition of  <dig> copies of a  <dig> bp red/green locus control region  is sufficient to result in weak l/m cone-specific expression in vivo  <cit> . in the murine retina, a 277-bp promoter fragment from the human tαc gene, coupled with a 214-bp irbp enhancer, directs cone-specific expression  <cit> . in xenopus,  <dig>  kb of the red opsin promoter is sufficient to drive expression in cone photoreceptors  <cit> . within this proximal promoter, conserved sequences required for high-level and cone-specific expression were identified, including a  <dig> bp rop <dig> element that restricts expression to xenopus cones  <cit> . similarly, in heterologous analyses, a proximal  <dig> bp of the mouse cone arrestin promoter is sufficient to drive expression in xenopus cone photoreceptors, whereas a shorter  <dig> bp cone arrestin promoter fragment directs expression in cone and rod photoreceptors  <cit> . consenus tata and crx-binding elements are required for this photoreceptor-specific expression  <cit> .

more recently, cis-regulators of cone-specific expression have been identified using transgenic approaches in the cone-abundant zebrafish  <cit> . a  <dig>  kb promoter fragment of the single-copy uv opsin gene directs expression specifically to zebrafish uv cones  <cit> . a  <dig> bp proximal subsequence within this uv opsin promoter is sufficient to alter the specificity of a rhodopsin promoter such that it directs reporter expression in rods and uv cones  <cit> . in the quadruplicated array of green opsin genes, a  <dig> bp lcr, located ~ <dig> kb upstream, is necessary for the activity of the four green opsin promoters in vivo, and is sufficient to override the cell-type specificity of a uv opsin promoter fragment by directing it to drive expression in green opsin-expressing cones  <cit> . cis-elements repressing blue opsin expression in zebrafish uv cones and pineal cells have also been identified  <cit> .

using the zebrafish gnat <dig> gene encoding tαc, we are exploring the mechanisms controlling the initiation of cone photoreceptor-specific expression in vivo. previously, we identified ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  kb promoter fragments from the zebrafish tαc gene that initiate robust egfp expression in the four morphological subtypes of differentiating cones at  <dig> dpf  <cit> . subsequently, we characterised cone photoreceptor regulatory element  <dig> , a  <dig> bp enhancer element ~  <dig>  kb upstream of the tαc promoter  <cit> . cpre- <dig> is necessary for cone-specific expression from tαc promoter fragments, but is not sufficient to enhance activity from a heterologous uv opsin promoter  <cit> . here, we characterise regulatory elements in the proximal tαc promoter. we identify  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb promoter fragments of the tαc gene that are sufficient to initiate cone-specific expression. we then identify photoreceptor regulatory element  <dig> , a  <dig> bp sequence located in the  <dig>  kb construct, that specifically binds eye nuclear protein. in contrast to cpre- <dig>  pre- <dig> is not necessary for cone-specific expression from large tαc gene promoter fragments, but is sufficient to enhance the transcriptional activity of heterologous uv opsin and rhodopsin promoters in differentiating photoreceptor cells.

RESULTS
identification of minimal cone-specific promoters
we identify minimal zebrafish tαc/gnat <dig> promoter fragments that direct cone-specific expression in larval retinae using transient transgenic assays . as expected, constructs with large  <dig> and  <dig> bp promoter fragments drive robust egfp expression in differentiating retinal cone photoreceptors and in the pineal  <cit> . however, constructs with only  <dig> or  <dig> bp of tαc promoter are sufficient to direct weak, cone-specific expression in ~1% of larvae . the absence of detectable pineal expression with the shorter constructs indicates that enhancer elements required to initiate pineal expression are located between - <dig> and - <dig> bp.

pre- <dig> specifically binds eye nuclear factors
to identify cis-elements in the proximal promoter region that bind nuclear factors, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays . four probes, corresponding to sequences within the proximal  <dig>  kb of the zebrafish tαc promoter, were incubated with nuclear extracts isolated from adult zebrafish eyes . no specific complexes were detected with probes 1- <dig> . however, probe  <dig> forms a complex with nuclear factors contained in zebrafish ocular tissue . when probe  <dig> is incubated with increasing concentrations of eye nuclear extract, there is a dose-dependent increase in the intensity of the shifted complex. in contrast, probe  <dig> does not form a complex with nuclear extract isolated from mid-body tissue. the specificity of the interaction between probe  <dig> and eye nuclear factors was confirmed in competition assays. whereas complex formation between radio-labelled probe  <dig> and eye nuclear factors was completely abolished by competition with  <dig> or  <dig> m excess of unlabeled probe  <dig>  complex formation was not inhibited with  <dig> m excess of a non-related competitor probe . these results suggest that the observed probe  <dig> complexes are tissue- and sequence-specific. interestingly, probe  <dig>  which was subsequently named photoreceptor regulatory element  <dig> , is located ~ <dig> bp upstream of the predicted zebrafish tαc transcription start site, and adjacent to the 5' border of the minimal  <dig> bp construct that drives cone-specific expression.

multiple pre- <dig> sequences are required for complex formation with eye nuclear factors
bioinformatic analyses reveal that probe 4/pre- <dig> has sequence homology to known or predicted cis-regulators of photoreceptor expression , including an e-box , an otx element , ret  <dig> , nre , pce-ii , rhodopsin enhancer element  and the 5' end of the zebrafish green opsin lcr   <cit> . to refine the pre- <dig> sequences required for complex formation with eye nuclear protein, and to evaluate the significance of the homologous cis-sequences, probes containing deletions or mutations were tested in electrophoretic mobility shift assays . pre- <dig> probes with a  <dig> bp deletion at the 5' end, a  <dig> bp deletion at the 3' end or both deletions, fail to form complexes with eye nuclear protein . however, when added as  <dig> or  <dig> m excess cold competitor, the three deletion probes prevent eye nuclear protein forming complexes with radio-labelled wildtype pre- <dig> . this competitive inhibition is specific, as  <dig> or  <dig> m excess of a non-related probe does not prevent complex formation . thus,  <dig> and  <dig> bp terminal sequences are essential for ocular trans-factors to form a dna-protein complex with pre- <dig> . five mutant probes with  <dig> bp mutations distributed throughout pre- <dig> were also analysed . four of the mutant probes  fail to form complexes with eye nuclear protein. in contrast, mutant probe p4me forms an equivalent complex as the wildtype pre- <dig> probe. in summary, the mutant analyses identify four distinct  <dig> bp sequences, distributed across the majority of pre- <dig>  that are required for complex formation with eye nuclear factors .

pre- <dig> is not required for activity from a  <dig>  kb tαc promoter construct
to determine if pre- <dig> is required for initiation of transgene expression in cone photoreceptors, we tested the in vivo activity of a reporter construct containing an internal pre- <dig> deletion . in comparison to the wildtype 2521-bp tαc promoter construct, no significant differences in the pattern of expression is observed when pre- <dig> is deleted. both constructs are expressed in 42-44% of injected embryos and there is no significant difference in the number of egfp-expressing cells observed in the retina with these constructs. this may reflect functional redundancy with additional pre-1-like sequences. indeed, bioinformatic alignments to the 2521-bp tαc promoter reveals  <dig> sequences with >60% identity to pre- <dig> . additional searches of zebrafish genes with enriched expression in zebrafish rod or cone photoreceptors reveals the presence of multiple sequences in the upstream promoter region with >60% identity to pre- <dig> . however, whether these pre-1-like sequences have unique roles in photoreceptor gene regulation is questionable as sequences with >60% identity to pre- <dig> are also found in the upstream promoter regions of the β-actin and gapdh encoding housekeeping genes . in addition, although one pre-1-like sequence is typically found within  <dig> kb promoter regions of genes encoding tαc orthologues, there is no evidence of evolutionary pressure to retain a homologous pre- <dig> sequence in a conserved location . by selecting pre-1-like sequences whose identity score is greater than those in the housekeeping genes, we discovered that the zebrafish rhodopsin gene has distal and proximal pre-1-like sequence with 71% and 72% identity, respectively . notably, compared to pre- <dig>  the proximal rhodopsin pre- <dig> is present at an equivalent spatial location and orientation relative to the gene transcription initiation site, and is designated pre-1-rho.

pre- <dig> is sufficient to enhance photoreceptor-specific promoters
to circumvent potential functional redundancy issues in the deletion constructs, the ability of multiple pre- <dig> and pre-1-rho modules to enhance the in vivo activity of heterologous promoters was tested instead . chimeric constructs comprising of  <dig> copies of pre- <dig> or pre-1-rho upstream of the previously described zebrafish uv opsin or rhodopsin promoters were tested in transient transgenesis assays  <cit> . a  <dig>  kb zebrafish uv opsin promoter fragment directs weak, but tissue-specific expression in differentiating uv cone photoreceptors . pre- <dig> functionality is unmasked in this assay, as three copies of pre- <dig> are sufficient to significantly enhance the reporter activity from the uv opsin promoter . surprisingly, a chimera with three copies of pre-1-rho, which has high sequence identity to pre- <dig>  is unable to enhance activity of the uv-promoter . pre- <dig> is also able to enhance the in vivo activity of a rod photoreceptor-specific promoter. a  <dig>  kb zebrafish rhodopsin promoter fragment drives moderate reporter expression, specifically in differentiating rod photoreceptors . in chimeric constructs, three copies of pre- <dig> are also sufficient to significantly enhance reporter expression from this rod-specific promoter . analysis of retinal sections from zebrafish injected with the rod chimeric construct indicates that pre- <dig> increases the number of rod photoreceptor cells expressing the egfp reporter, without altering rod photoreceptor-specificity . the  <dig>  kb zebrafish rhodopsin promoter fragment on its own  or with three copies of pre- <dig> upstream  drives expression in egfp-positive cells that co-localise with 4c <dig>  a marker for rod photoreceptors , but not with zpr- <dig>  a marker for cone photoreceptors .

discussion
in order to better understand the molecular genetics initiating cone photoreceptor-specific expression in vivo, we have utilised the zebrafish model to identify cis-regulatory elements in the upstream promoter region of the tαc gene. during phototransduction, tαc is required for cone opsins to activate phosphodiesterase. mutations in the human tαc gene cause total colour blindness, and mutations in the zebrafish orthologue also result in cone-based blindness  <cit> .

the zebrafish tαc gene is specifically expressed in all cone photoreceptor types by  <dig>  dpf and therefore, contains the cis-regulatory elements to direct transgene expression in all differentiating and mature cones. previously, we demonstrated that a  <dig>  kb promoter fragment of the tαc gene initiates robust transgene expression in differentiating cones and identified cpre- <dig>  a  <dig> bp distal enhancer  <cit> . here, we characterise the proximal promoter of the zebrafish tαc gene and demonstrate that a  <dig>  kb fragment is sufficient to initiate cone-specific expression. in this proximal  <dig>  kb promoter fragment, we identify a photoreceptor regulatory element, pre- <dig>  this  <dig> bp sequence is specifically bound by nuclear factors expressed in ocular tissue. pre- <dig> is sufficient to enhance photoreceptor-specific expression from heterologous uv cone opsin and rhodopsin promoters. typical of classical enhancers, pre- <dig> is spatially independent, enhancing expression when upstream of a  <dig>  kb uv opsin or a  <dig>  kb rhodopsin promoter. the combined activity of two distal enhancers, an uncharacterised enhancer dependent region at -~ <dig> / <dig>  kb and the proximal pre- <dig> characterised here, likely contribute significantly to the robust tissue-specific expression of tαc in cones   <cit> .

in comparison to cis-regulators of photoreceptor expression previously described in zebrafish, pre- <dig> has unique characteristics. cone photoreceptor regulatory element  <dig> , a short distal enhancer of tαc, is necessary for high levels of promoter activity in cones, but is not sufficient to enhance expression from heterologous promoters  <cit> . a  <dig> bp distal lcr in the green opsin array or a  <dig> bp sequence in the proximal uv opsin promoter are sufficient to enhance expression levels and to override specificity of heterologous promoters  <cit> . in contrast to these, pre- <dig> is sufficient to enhance the transcriptional activity of heterologous promoters, but not to override rod photoreceptor specificity. despite these functional differences, a unifying feature of the rh2-lcr, the uv opsin enhancer, a blue opsin regulatory element and pre- <dig>  is the presence of consensus sites for otx  <cit> . overall, this indicates that pre- <dig> binding factors, which enhance basal promoter activity, are expressed in both rod and cone photoreceptors, but that additional cis-elements dictate tissue specificity.

although pre- <dig> is sufficient to enhance photoreceptor-specific expression, pre- <dig> is not required to direct cone-specific expression from a  <dig>  kb tαc promoter fragment. the difference is likely to result from functionally redundant cis-elements. indeed, three sequences homologous to pre- <dig> are present in the  <dig>  kb promoter fragment. however, caution is necessary when associating sequence homology with functional equivalency. this is best exemplified by pre-1-rho which has the highest sequence identity to pre- <dig>  but which is unable to enhance activity from a heterologous promoter, and thus is functionally distinct.

pre- <dig> has consensus sites for known cis-regulators of photoreceptor expression including e-box, otx, nre, pce-ii and ret  <dig> elements. e-box motifs, bound by basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, have been reported in the promoter regions of several photoreceptor expressed genes and pce-ii is sufficient to drive photoreceptor-specific expression in xenopus  <cit> . ret  <dig> is a dnasei protected site in the distal rhodopsin enhancer region  and forms a complex with factors expressed specifically in retinal tissue  <cit> . the transcription factor, neural retina-specific leucine zipper , is expressed in rods, and the presence of an nrl response element  in this enhancer of rod and cone photoreceptor expression is a little unexpected. in conjunction with the cone-rod homeobox  transcription factor, nrl promotes rod opsin expression in rods, and by regulating expression of the nuclear receptor nr2e <dig>  nrl suppresses the expression of cone genes in rods  <cit> . this suggests that a factor other than nrl binds pre- <dig>  that the activity of nrl alters depending on the presence of adjacent cis-elements, or that the consensus nre in pre- <dig> is non-functional. in contrast, the presence of an otx element, a binding site for the crx transcription factor is unsurprising, as crx regulates expression of rod and cone genes in mice, zebrafish and xenopus  <cit> . pre- <dig> also shows homology with the lcr regulating expression of the zebrafish green opsin genes and the bovine rhodopsin enhancer region  <cit> . of all these putative regulatory sequences, functional analyses indicate that the consensus otx and e-box sites are most important .

it is likely that pre- <dig> is bound by crx at the otx site and a basic helix-loop-helix factor at the e-box site. this is supported by the requirement of consensus otx and e-box sites for complex formation of ocular nuclear factors with pre- <dig>  furthermore, the consensus otx and e-box sites are mutated in pre-1-rho which shows high sequence conservation, but no functional conservation, with the pre- <dig> identified in the tαc promoter . crx is expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors and regulates gene expression in conjunction with co-expressed transcription factors including nrl, nr2e <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig> and qrx  <cit> . crx is known to bind in the vicinity of the mouse tαc gene  <cit> . in addition, reducing or eliminating crx expression in zebrafish morphants and mouse knockouts, results in a significant down-regulation of tαc expression  <cit> . crx also recruits histone acetyltransferases  <cit> . however, it is unlikely that pre- <dig> functions via histone modifications in our transient assays where the majority of the episomal dna is predicted not to be bound by chromatin  <cit> . a basic helix-loop-helix factor that potentially binds pre- <dig> is zash1a, an achaete-scute complex-like  <dig>  orthologue. this speculation is supported by the known binding of the mash- <dig> orthologue to an e-box in the rodent rhodopsin promoter, the ability of mash- <dig> to induce retinal progenitors to a photoreceptor cell fate and the robust expression of zash1a in the developing zebrafish eye  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
deciphering the genomic dna sequences that control tissue-specific gene expression provides fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms enabling complex systems to develop and function. downstream translations include engineering of cis-sequences to appropriately control gene expression for emerging gene therapies. in this study, we identify and characterise photoreceptor regulatory element- <dig> , a proximal  <dig> bp sequence, sufficient to enhance photoreceptor-specific gene expression in differentiating rods and cones. future studies will aim to identify the cis-sequences and trans-factors that co-operate with pre- <dig> to regulate cone-specific expression.
