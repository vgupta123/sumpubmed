BACKGROUND
small nucleolar rnas  constitute a major class of small rna in eukaryotes. there are two broad types of snorna, which differ in structure and function. h/aca snornas are characterized by a double stem-loop structure, and many members of this class are involved in guiding pseudouridylation of other functional rnas, most notably rrna 
 <cit> . most c/d snornas are likewise known to be guides, directing 2'-o-methylation of ribose on a broad assortment of rnas, including ribosomal rna  
 <cit> . while the variety of target molecules is suggestive of an ongoing role in fine tuning or regulating a range of processes 
 <cit> , including splicing 
 <cit> , the antiquity of both classes of snorna has been established through the identification in archaea of sno-like rnas resembling both h/aca and c/d family snornas 
 <cit> . moreover, comparative analysis of modification patterns across bacteria, archaea and eukaryote rrna indicates that some pseudouridylation and 2'-o-methylation modification sites may predate the diversification of the three domains of life 
 <cit> . however, bacterial modifications are not generated in a snorna-dependent manner, so while comparative genomic and experimental analyses demonstrate that snornas and their associated proteins appear ubiquitous among major eukaryote and archaeal groups 
 <cit> , there is a disconnect between the inferred antiquity of this class of rna and conserved site modifications to rrna. this may indicate that snornas emerged following the divergence of bacteria from archaea and eukaryotes, replacing a protein enzyme-based modification system 
 <cit> . alternatively, snornas may have an origin in an rna world, having coevolved with the early ribosome 
 <cit> . as part of the latter theory, it was proposed that the intronic position of snornas may be related to the origin of the first mrnas. under this ‘introns-first’ model , exons were recruited from the regions between individual snornas, the latter becoming intronic following the advent of the first protein-coding genes 
 <cit> .
 <cit> . in this model, transcription of rna genes requires subsequent processing of precursor rnas to release functional rnas. processing via splicing leads to the production of processed snornas, with intervening material spliced together. this material is later coopted for stabilisation of trna interactions during peptide synthesis, leading to the emergence of the first mrnas. in this model, the first proteins serve to augment rna function, so the association between snornas and ribosomal protein-coding genes is historical and evolutionarily stable. b) intronic organisation of snornas is the result of selection for coexpression of snorna and its host gene 
 <cit> . this model does not explicitly state what the ancestral condition would have been, and is therefore compatible with this organisation being ancestral , a more recent de novo origin of the snorna, or with this association being the result of snorna retrotransposition.

while it is difficult to definitively establish the timing of emergence of snornas, the introns-first model does generate testable predictions. one prediction is that these early rna-world snornas may still be housed within the introns of the protein-coding genes postulated to have evolved around them. if such an association has been preserved, host genes should be among the oldest genes, traceable to the origin of templated protein synthesis 
 <cit> . a strong version of this hypothesis is that this association is evolutionarily stable, such that duplication and retrotransposition have not broken up the association. an alternative view is that the intronic position of snornas reflects selection for coexpression 
 <cit>  . this model makes no assumption as to the evolutionary and genomic mechanisms that gave rise to such an organization. a strong version of this model is that the relationship between intronic snorna and host gene is fixed, as per introns-first, but with one key difference: under coexpression, unless individual snornas originated in the optimal genomic environment, they must have been mobile early in their evolutionary history, with selection precluding further mobility once the optimal intronic location has been reached. these hypotheses both suggest intronic position of snornas has been stable across deep evolutionary timescales, so are not mutually exclusive. a third possibility is that the only constraint on snorna location is maintenance of an expression profile compatible with snorna function.

some snornas have been shown to be intragenomically mobile 
 <cit> , with the most stunning example being reported from platypus, where a single snorna family was found to be present in over  <dig>  <dig> copies 
 <cit> . in support of the evolutionary stability of intron-located snornas, a recent study revealed that 14% of annotated snornas present in more than one genome are positionally conserved across birds and mammals, and that of these 97% are intronic 
 <cit> . these observations indicate that both mobility and positional stablility of snornas are observed in vertebrate genomes. however, for genomic position to be compatible with the predictions resulting from the introns-first model, there would need to be stability across the entire eukaryote tree. given that large numbers of introns can be readily traced to the root of the eukaryote tree  
 <cit> , it seems reasonable to expect that a signal of positional stability, if present, should be preserved at this evolutionary depth. while the coexpression model is not mutually incompatible with introns-first, the function of snornas involved in generating ribosomes means conserved intronic snornas should be associated with broadly-expressed host genes, but that those host genes need not be orthologous. across birds and mammals, previous analyses 
 <cit>  indicate that the most conserved snornas are encoded in broadly expressed host genes, potentially compatible with both models.

in order to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of snornas, we sought to address the following questions.  <dig>  do any snorna families trace back to the leca?  <dig>  do eukaryotic snornas show evidence of homology with archaeal snorna-like srnas?  <dig>  is the intronic location of snornas evolutionarily stable across the eukaryote tree? we report that dozens of snorna families can be traced to the leca. however, none of these leca snorna families show significant levels of similarity with archaeal sno-like rnas, precluding firm placement of individual snorna families in the common ancestor of these two groups. in agreement with previous studies 
 <cit> , we find numerous introns can be placed in the leca. a subset of these introns do carry snornas, but close inspection reveals that snornas in equivalent conserved positions are not orthologous. this result is consistent with independent gains of unrelated snornas into orthologous introns. finally, we report that snorna host genes are characterised by broad expression profiles, as judged from expression patterns across  <dig> human tissues. we therefore conclude that these data best fit ongoing genomic mobility of snornas, with selection maintaining expression patterns but not genomic location. on the basis of these results we outline a 'constrained drift' model for the evolution of snorna-host gene relationships.

RESULTS
placement of snorna families in the leca
to establish the degree to which snornas are conserved across eukaryotes, we examined the distribution of all rfam snorna families identifiable across  <dig> eukaryote genomes . using dollo parsimony, we reconstructed the pattern of snorna conservation across the eukaryote tree using a five supergroup phylogeny, with the root of the eukaryote tree between unikonts and bikonts 
 <cit> . this analysis identified  <dig> individual snorna families and  <dig> multi-family snorna clans traceable to the leca . of these,  <dig> of  <dig> families/clans were c/d box snornas . h/aca snornas are generally more difficult to detect owing to shorter, less well-conserved sequence motifs 
 <cit> , which may explain the comparatively lower number of conserved families recovered by this approach.

characterized snornas are heavily biased towards plants and animals 
 <cit>   so these results are dependent on the eukaryote root in figure 
 <dig> being correctly located. however, independent attempts to locate the root of the eukaryote tree using a range of methods consistently place opisthokonts  on the opposite side of the root from archaeplastida 
 <cit> , as per figure 
 <dig>  and minor differences in the exact placement of the root across these studies are all nevertheless compatible with the results we present here.

rfam clans may potentially provide an additional source of information about snorna relationships, and could reflect family expansion through processes such as duplication 
 <cit>  or retrotransposition 
 <cit> . in our analysis a clan may be placed in the leca if two related families are treated as a single character – this could be the result of either, 1) a functional shift in one part of the eukaryote tree , 2) hidden paralogy , or 3) artefactual split of a family into smaller groups so as to maintain specificity of the respective covariance models used to define a family 
 <cit> . for clans containing individual rfam families that can each be independently placed in leca, it may be therefore possible that the clan evolved prior to the diversification of eukaryotes, with families having evolved in the stem by duplication and divergence.

to assess whether clan groupings carry biological signal consistent with duplication and divergence, we examined the three clans where the constituent rfam families could be independently traced to the leca  — all three clans are comprised of c/d-box snornas. for snord <dig> ,  <dig> of  <dig> snorna families independently traverse the eukaryote root, while for clans snord <dig>  and snord <dig>  respectively,  <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> families predate leca. phylogenetic trees cannot be produced for snornas at this evolutionary depth. we therefore reasoned that if individual snorna families traceable to leca perform modifications at different target sites, this would be consistent with clans having evolved via duplication and divergence prior to the diversification of eukaryotes . to examine this, for each clan, we took all families and established probable sites of rrna modification for each family . we then compared our results to published experimental data on modification sites in human, yeast and arabidopsis. we find support for recent expansions , but no family can be traced to duplication events predating the diversification of eukaryotes. instead, it appears that the division of clans into families may be artefactual for these three cases, and, in the case of the snord <dig> clan, the clan likely represents the orthologous group .
 <dig> 

the modification targets of leca c/d snornas are also traceable to the leca
an implicit assumption in the classification of snornas into families is that each family contains members that perform the equivalent biological function across species. consequently, if individual snorna families can be traced back to the leca, we may be able to examine to what extent their function is also conserved across eukaryote evolution. however, relative to sequenced genomes/identified snornas, the number of species for which modification sites for rrna have been experimentally characterized is comparatively low 
 <cit> . we therefore sought to establish a computational means by which to predict target sites, given snorna and rrna sequence data from an organism. we chose to focus on c/d snornas for two reasons. first, in our initial rfam-based analyses, the vast majority of snornas putatively in leca were c/d snornas. second, the guide sequences of c/d snornas are contiguous; in contrast, h/aca snornas carry bipartite guide sequences, making computational identification non-trivial.

for each species in our dataset, we took all rfam c/d family snorna entries and performed blasts against the ssu and lsu rrna sequences from that species. this generated a blast map of potential interactions. as blast can detect similarities for reverse complements, each map detects hits equivalent to the interaction between c/d guide and cognate rrna. to separate probable target sites from spurious blast hits, we looked for evidence of evolutionary conservation: for every putative modification site, we examined whether the distribution of hits across all species supported placement of that interaction in leca . we then examined overlap between predicted leca modification sites and rfam families or clans previously determined  to be traceable to the leca. as shown in figure 
 <dig> there is good correspondence between predicted leca modifications and rfam families .

as these target sites are predicted using a computational strategy, we sought to establish whether they gave reasonable correspondence to independently verified target sites and their cognate snornas 
 <cit> . we therefore compared our set of deeply conserved modifications against known modification sites from human, yeast and arabidopsis. under the unikont/bikont rooting, arabidopsis is on the other side of the root from human and yeast, so this gives us an independent means of predicting putative leca modifications. table 
 <dig> shows the proportion of overlap between experimentally determined modification sites and our computational predictions for arabidopsis, yeast and human. of  <dig> previously reported sites conserved across these three species 
 <cit> , our comparative genomics approach fully recovers  <dig> .

to gauge the reliability of the three types of data , we compared the results of all three methods . the intersection between the  <dig> leca snornas,  <dig> leca blast-mapped sites and  <dig> independently-mapped leca modification sites is  <dig>  we note however that this is an underestimate: two leca snorna families  are involved exclusively in rrna cleavage but not 2'-o-methylation, and two further putative leca-snornas belong to the h/aca class  - so are automatically excluded from this intersect for this reason. in summary, a stringent, total evidence-based approach  identifies a minimum of  <dig> modification guide c/d snorna families with conserved function traceable to the root of the eukaryote tree, under the unikont/bikont topology.

some leca snornas have known archaeal counterparts
archaea and eukaryotes both carry an equivalent h/aca and c/d rna-based guide machinery, with a conserved set of associated proteins 
 <cit> . however, it is not trivial to identify archaeal and eukaryote rna counterparts using sequence data alone. we therefore took the alternative approach of asking whether any archaeal sno-like srnas are responsible for modification at a position in archaeal rrna equivalent to conserved eukaryotic rrna modifications. this identified only one case, archaeal sr <dig>  found in both crenarchaea and euryarchaea, which had previously been predicted by gaspin and co-workers to guide 2'-o-methylation at an equivalent site to yeast snr <dig> 
 <cit> . our analysis  placed the snord43/snr <dig> clan  in leca. in order to examine possible homology, we generated a multiple sequence alignment of members of the cl <dig> clans and archaeal sr <dig> sequences using an alignment algorithm optimised for non-coding rna 
 <cit> , and sought to establish whether secondary structure was also conserved, using alifold from the vienna package 
 <cit> . the alignment shown in figure 
 <dig> shows similarities in the guide sequence, but we find no clear indication of structural conservation. consequently, while these findings are consistent with snord <dig> & sr <dig> being orthologous , we cannot rule out that possibility that these sequence similarities are a result of convergence given selection for the underlying function. gaspin and colleagues reported  <dig> additional cases of modification equivalence, three of which correspond to eukaryotic snorna families in our rfam dataset. however, these could either not be placed in leca  or exhibited limited sequence similarity, precluding clear inference of common ancestry .

testing the introns first hypothesis for the origin of mrna
available data are consistent with snorna-based rrna processing/modification being present in the common ancestor of archaea and eukaryotes 
 <cit> . however, an earlier rna world origin has also been suggested 
 <cit> . consistent with this, a small number of experimentally-characterized 2'-o-methylation and pseudouridylation sites on rrna are conserved across all three domains of life 
 <cit> , and we note that other rna modifications likewise appear to have evolved prior to divergence of the three domains 
 <cit> . however, an alternative view is that the ancestral system for 2'-o-methylation and pseudouridylation was protein-enzyme based as in extant bacterial lineages, with the snorna-based system evolving in response to a need for more extensive modifications in archaea and eukaryotes 
 <cit> . it is not possible to directly test these alternative scenarios, both of which are plausible. however, one aspect of the 'snornas-ancient' view is amenable to testing through comparative genomics. under the introns-first model, the intronic location of snornas is an ancestral state, predating the origin of genetically-encoded protein synthesis. briefly, the ancestral state is hypothesized to be rna genes linked on chromosomes; the intervening spaces between these rnas is later coopted into the role of messenger rna. this model assumes that processing of individual snornas from larger polycistronic rna transcripts occurred via a proto-spliceosome 
 <cit>  . under this model, these intervening regions are coopted as the first proto-exons. consistent with this view, many snornas are housed in the introns of ribosomal protein genes, particularly in vertebrate genomes 
 <cit> . moreover, ribosomal protein genes are one of the most ancient classes of gene in the cell 
 <cit> , and, significantly, an evolutionary history dominated by vertical descent is apparent for this class of genes 
 <cit> . while any scenario for very early evolution is by nature speculative, introns-first predicts that the intronic position of snornas is ancestral. if the intronic location of any snorna is conserved across the eukaryote tree, such a pattern would be consistent with introns-first .

to establish if individual introns within the cohort of leca host genes could also be traced to leca, we reconstructed intron presence in leca using parsimony . this yielded 9117/ <dig>  orthologous intron loci that can be traced to leca , in broad agreement with other studies indicating high numbers of introns can be traced to leca 
 <cit> . for any intron carrying a snorna, we next independently compared intron ancestry with snorna intron occupancy across the eukaryote tree. this yielded  <dig> orthologous leca introns that also carry a snorna . finally, we examined rfam family constituency for all  <dig> cases across all eukaryote genomes. we reasoned that if all positionally equivalent snornas were from the same family, this would provide an initial indicator of snorna orthology.
 <dig> 

strikingly, we find no evidence for common ancestry for any of these  <dig> cases, based on rfam family membership , and in many cases the snornas are not even of the same type , clearly precluding homology. this pattern, while precluding the placement of intronic snornas in leca, does not in itself indicate snorna mobility. for the  <dig> cases of non-orthologous snorna occupancy in figure 
 <dig>  we therefore examined snorna distribution more closely in an attempt to distinguish ancestral from derived snorna occupancy among orthologous introns. as shown in table 
 <dig> none of the putative leca-intronic snornas can be claimed to trace to the leca, being restricted for the most part to a few species. manual inspection of alignments and sequence features for these equivalent intronic snornas from the same class did not reveal any cases of homology. we therefore conclude that these data do not support the evolutionary stability of intronic snornas, predicted under the introns-first hypothesis.

leca genes hosting intronic snornas are broadly-expressed
while our results demonstrate that intronic location of snornas does not trace to the leca, it is striking that 61%  of snorna-containing host genes in our study can themselves be placed in the leca . we were therefore interested to know what features of these broadly-distributed genes might make them an ideal location for intronic snornas. as rrna function is essential, modification of rrna should also be required in all cell types in multicellular organisms. we may therefore expect that the main requirement for host genes is that they should be ubiquitously expressed. we previously showed that for positionally conserved intronic snornas in the bird-mammal ancestor, intronic snorna-containing genes were broadly expressed, and fundamental processes such as translation were significantly overrepresented amongst this cohort, whereas intronic snornas with a shallower evolutionary association with their host gene  were not overrepresented among broadly-expressed genes 
 <cit> . more generally, ‘older’ genes are known to be more broadly expressed across a range of tissues in vertebrates 
 <cit> . we therefore examined the expression pattern of the entire set of  <dig> leca host genes using human expression data 
 <cit> . as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the distribution of expression entropies of human genes shows that genes hosting an intronic snorna are more broadly expressed  than non-host genes . we conclude that the preference for integration into the introns of ancient  host genes is a consequence of these genes being broadly expressed. such host genes are compatible with the requirement for broad expression of snornas.

recent migration of a snorna into the intron of a ribosomal protein gene
as none of the non-homologous  <dig> snornas identified in leca introns could be definitively attributed to derived mobility-associated gain , we combed our dataset for intronic snornas that could be unambiguously attributed to gain. figure 
 <dig> shows one such example. snora <dig> is an intronic snorna, the ancestral position of which is within the ubiquitin associated protein 2-like gene, ubap2l. both ubap2l and snora <dig> trace to the amniote  ancestor, but, prior to the divergence of primates, snora <dig> has expanded into the introns of two leca genes, mrpl <dig> and ndc <dig>  ndc <dig> is a nuclear pore complex constituent that traces to the leca 
 <cit> , whereas mrpl <dig> is a nuclear-encoded constituent of the mitochondrial ribosome, and ultimately derives from the bacterial ancestor of the mitochondrion 
 <cit> . further, the introns in the mrpl <dig> gene derive from intron gain 
 <cit>  and, in the case of snora <dig>  the host intron is positionally-conserved across opisthokonts and plants. we therefore conclude that snora <dig> has moved into genes traceable to leca, and that, in the case of mrpl <dig>  this is an irrefutable case of gain of both intron and intronic snorna.
 <cit>  and ndc <dig> 
 <cit>  can be traced to the leca, while ubap2l is traceable to the vertebrate ancestor . expression data 
 <cit>  indicate all three host genes are widely expressed in amniotes . grey squares indicate snora <dig> presence in the intron. the bottom graphic shows the position of snora <dig> in the introns of each gene is indicated by arrowheads. gene orientation is indicated by < and >. the gene structure in the figure is from human. leca—last eukaryotic common ancestor, va—vertebrate ancestor, ma—mammalian ancestor, pr – primate ancestor.

discussion
under the rna world hypothesis, that genetically-encoded proteins and dna genomes were preceded by functional rnas and rna genomes, it has previously been suggested that many rna-based processes may directly trace back to this early stage in the evolution of life. such arguments have largely been made on the basis of comparisons of functional rnas 
 <cit> , though fewer than 1% of known rna families show evidence of deep evolutionary ancestry 
 <cit> . for snornas, while a compelling case can be made for an rna-world origin 
 <cit> , it is equally possible that this class of rna has a more recent origin 
 <cit> . in so far as eukaryotic snornas have counterparts in archaea, and given that, in both domains, these rnas interact with a common set of associated proteins 
 <cit> , the origin of snornas in the common ancestor of both domains appears likely 
 <cit> .

we aimed to specifically examine the antiquity of snornas using comparative genomics. our results confirm that individual snorna families can be placed in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. using a conservative total-evidence approach, incorporating rfam family conservation, a blast-based comparative genomics approach to identifying target modification sites, and comparison with experimentally-mapped sites, we report that a minimum of  <dig> c/d type snornas can be placed in the leca.

based on a conservative estimate of snornas in leca, we found three leca snornas for which a positionally-conserved modification was present in archaea. while the archaeal counterpart was known for all these cases, we deemed the sequence and secondary structure similarities across domains to be insufficient for an inference of homology to be made. while the equivalence of the modification-sites is striking, our analysis was unable to provide stronger evidence in favour of a common origin for individual rna families. it may simply be the case that, given that snornas are short, evolutionary signal, if it did exist, has been erased over such timescales.

finally, we aimed to establish whether the intronic location of snornas is consistent with snorna gene mobility, with selection favouring colonisation of introns in genes with broad gene expression, or whether position is evolutionarily conserved. we find that, despite intron position being conserved across the eukaryote tree , none of the snornas residing in these putative leca introns are positionally stable at this evolutionary depth. a specific prediction of the introns-first model is that snornas are found in the introns of the most deeply-conserved protein-coding genes. evolutionary signal consistent with this model requires the intron, the snorna associated with that intron, and the position of the snorna within the intron to all be traceable to the leca. our analysis therefore rejects this strict version of the introns-first hypothesis. as per the introns-early vs introns-late debate 
 <cit> , alternative versions of introns-first are possible, and the snorna mobility we observe is not in itself incompatible with an rna-world origin. however, if, as our data suggest, all trace of any patterns compatible with an early origin have been lost , an early origin necessarily remains speculative.

we suggest that our results may instead better fit an alternative evolutionary model which we call 'constrained drift' . in this model, individual snornas can migrate to different genomic locations, provided the overall expression profile is preserved. this model is compatible with a range of genetic organisations, including a single snorna expressed from a ubiquitously-expressed host gene, subfunctionalised snornas expressed from host genes with compatible, non-overlapping expression profiles, and independent snorna genes with either ubiquitous or subfunctionalised expression profiles. as phenotype is satisfied by all four cases, we predict that genomic location and organisation should be free to drift and is selectively constrained only by the requirement that a ubiquitous expression profile is maintained.

our analysis of expression profiles of human genes bearing intronic snornas  indicates that snorna-containing genes have a broad expression profile. however, these expression data do not enable us to assess individual expression profiles of snornas, and we have not examined snorna paralogy, both of which would need to be examined to fully determine whether one of the gene organisation patterns described in figure 
 <dig> dominates. high-throughput expression data may soon enable us to examine this question in more detail.

CONCLUSIONS
using an evolutionary analysis, we have shown that the snorna apparatus was well-established in the leca. while numerous snornas can be traced to the leca, the intronic location of individual snornas is not stable over large evolutionary timescales, with no evidence for positional conservation traceable to the leca. the data presented here fit a model of ongoing mobility over shorter evolutionary timescales 
 <cit> , with natural selection acting to constrain drift. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  some genomic locations may be selected against if function is compromised. however, a more extreme drift model is plausible, since this role for selection assumes that all modifications are under strong selection, a contention which has not been demonstrated. in light of experimental studies showing weak observable phenotype associated with individual snorna knockouts 
 <cit> , it will be interesting to establish to what extent the modification of rrnas by snornas is governed by drift versus selection. for the set of most deeply conserved snornas identified here, we suspect that constrained drift best accounts for their genomic evolution. however, for snornas with a more recent evolutionary history the 'extreme' version of the drift model provides a valuable null hypothesis, which may be particularly helpful in assessing the significance of knockout studies 
 <cit> . while it is possible that snornas have expanded into novel functions 
 <cit> , it is notable that no other examples have been reported. rather than representing a cohort of novel functional rnas, some snornas housed in narrowly-expressed host genes 
 <cit>  may well be neutral, rather than the outcome of neofunctionalisation . combining comparative analyses, large-scale expression data and knockout phenotypes will be required to resolve this question.
