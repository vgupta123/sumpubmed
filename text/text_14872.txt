BACKGROUND
most steps involved in plant virus infection, such as the translation of viral genes, the replication of the viral genome and the movement of the viral genome/virion, involve interactions between relatively few viral components and a much more complex pool of host factors  <cit> . studies of viral-host interactions provide insight into the life cycle of viruses and could help to devise strategies to tackle viral epidemics among plants. identification of differentially expressed genes in plants during viral infection can help us to understand the defense systems employed by plants as well as the mechanisms behind the adaption of viruses to plant cells.

plants are known to defend themselves against attacks from pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, and sometimes other plants, by altering the host gene expression  <cit> . compared to other pathogens, viruses are a particularly serious threat, due to their high mutation rate, which makes them better able to evade host defense systems. plant viruses use a variety of strategies to promote infection in susceptible hosts. these strategies involve well-documented modifications to host cells such as the formation of replication complexes  <cit> , the suppression of post-transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> , alteration of cell-to-cell trafficking  <cit> , and interference with the regulation of host cell cycle  <cit> .

plant viruses have three prerequisites to survive. first, they must replicate in the initially infected cell. second, they must move into adjacent cells and the vascular system. third, they must escape from or suppress the host defense system, by means such as post transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> . in turn, plants express resistance genes and/or activate systemic acquired resistance to fight the invading viruses  <cit> . these resistance responses typically involve dramatic changes in the expression of host proteins, such as pathogenesis related  or hypersensitive response  related genes, receptor-like kinases, and serine/threonine kinases  <cit> .

bamboo mosaic virus , a single-stranded positive sense rna virus, is a member of the potexvirus genus in the flexsiviridae family. the 6366-nt genome of bamv comprises a 5'-end m7gpppg structure, a 3'-end poly  tail, 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions , and five open reading frames   <cit> . orf <dig> encodes a 155-kda polypeptide with three functional domains, i.e. the capping enzyme domain  <cit> , an rna helicase-like domain with rna 5' triphosphotase and ntpase activities  <cit> , and an rna-dependent rna polymerase domain  <cit> . orfs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  encoding proteins of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda, respectively  <cit>  are required for viral cell-to-cell movement  <cit> . the product of orf <dig> is the 25-kda coat protein. host factors, such as chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase, which interacts with the bamv 3' utr , may play a positive role in the accumulation of bamv accumulation in n. benthamiana  <cit> . a putative methyltransferase interacting with rdrp, identified by the yeast two-hybrid system plays a negative role in the accumulation of bamv  <cit> .

this study used cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism  to identify differentially expressed genes during bamv infection in n. benthamiana. the cdna-aflp technique is an efficient, sensitive, and reproducible technology offering several advantages over other pcr methodologies, such as a high degree of selectivity against rare mrna species  <cit> . the tobacco rattle virus -based silencing system was used to knock down the expression of differentially expressed genes obtained by cdna-aflp. this study examines and discusses the effects of gene-specific knockdowns on bamv infection.

RESULTS
screening of bamv infection-induced genes in n. benthamiana by cdna-aflp
total rna was extracted from the mock- and bamv-inoculated leaves  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days post inoculation, to identify differentially expressed genes in n. benthamiana plants following infection with bamv. to avoid genomic contamination of the dna and to enhance the efficiency of reverse transcription, we generated the cdna from oligo -purified mrnas and confirmed the efficiency of synthesizing cdna on a 5% polyacrylamide gel before proceeding with the production of a standard cdna-aflp template  <cit> .

to rule out false-positive signals in cdna-aflp, we compared the products from two different batches of mrna, derived from two independent inoculation experiments together on the same gel. in this study, we used eight different primer pairs, t-ac/m-ac, t-ac/m-ag, t-ac/m-ca, t-ac/m-ct, t-ac/m-ga, t-ac/m-gt, t-ac/m-tc, and t-ac/m-tg, to generate the cdna expression profiles through selective amplification of pcr . identifying the cdna fragments of differential levels was simple when lined up together as shown in figure  <dig>  from which we analyzed the amplified products derived from the t-ca/m-ga primer pair. we assigned positive bands only when the same banding profiles occurred in both batches. the eight primer pairs allowed detection of approximately  <dig> differentially expressed cdna bands. separation of these fluorescently labeled cdna-aflp fragments using  <dig> % polyacrylamide sequencing gel, imaged with a fluorescent scanner, and eluted from the gel, identified  <dig> fragments for up-regulation and  <dig> for down-regulation, following inoculation with bamv .

identification of major cdna species from bands containing multiple genes
we next amplified and cloned the cdna bands eluted from the cdna-aflp gels; dna sequencing of  <dig> to  <dig> clones from each cloning revealed the identity of the cdna inserts. sequencing results from approximately  <dig> clones, indicated that two-thirds  of the cropped gel fragments contained cdnas of multiple genes . these results had been expected, because the gel fragments included any cdnas in the region. therefore, further analysis was required to confirm the identity of the genes differentially expressed between mock- and bamv-inoculated samples.

logically, the clone identified at the highest frequency using dna sequencing would correspond to the differentially expressed cdna detected in each gel fragment . however, there was the possibility of skewed efficiency in the process of cloning the cdna fragments. target-specific semi-quantitative rt-pcr was performed to examine whether the expression pattern of the major cdna species identified in each band, was correlated with the signals in the cdna-aflp profile . a third batch of independently inoculated plants provided the mrna templates used for this experiment. we designed gene-specific primers according to the dna sequences of the major cdna clones for more than  <dig> bands . figure  <dig> shows representative results of rt-pcr analysis including those of acag2- <dig>  acct8- <dig>  acct2- <dig>  and acct <dig>  overall, the expression patterns for all examined targets were consistent with those in the cdna-aflp profile. therefore, we tentatively assigned the major cdna species identified from each band as representative of cdna in all  <dig> bands .

sequence analysis of differentially expressed cdna fragments
sequence analysis of the major cdna species listed in table  <dig> revealed that twenty-two of the 90-cdna fragments shared no significant homology with any known sequences found in the databases. on the other hand, we found analogs for  <dig> cdna fragments of which more than two-thirds were sequences derived from n. tabacum, arabidopsis, and rice . among these,  <dig> led to blast matches of biological significance as suggested by the e-values . table  <dig> lists the genes categorized according to function: twenty-two genes were involved in cell rescue, defense, death, and aging;  <dig> in energy;  <dig> in transcription;  <dig> in metabolism;  <dig> in translation;  <dig> in signal transduction, and  <dig> could not be classified. interestingly, three of the genes, namely the mpv17/pmp <dig> family protein , chloroplast carbonic anhydrase , and lipid transferase  were isolated from different selective primer sets, which remarkably led to identical cdna-aflp expression patterns for each target . these results implied that the cdna-aflp technique is a reliable and reproducible means to identify differentially expressed genes.

effect of gene-specific knockdown on the accumulation of bamv
to investigate the roles of the differentially expressed genes identified by cdna-aflp analysis in bamv infection cycle, the trv vigs system  <cit> , which has been used widely to knock down homologous genes in n. benthamiana  <cit> , was adopted to generate gene-specific knockdown plants. we evaluated the effects of lowered expression levels of individual host genes on the replication of bamv, i.e. viral rna and the accumulation of protein.

to assess the effect of the trv vector in n. benthamiana, gfp or luciferase orf  were introduced to the ptrv <dig> vector to serve as a control. fifteen genes, picked randomly from each assigned functional category  for knockdown experiments showed no significant effect on plant growth or development. most of these knockdown plants  exhibited no difference in morphology to that of the control plants . however, yellowing mosaics occurred on leaves of the acag <dig>  of the knockdown plants . the results of the studies of bamv regarding acag <dig> and acag <dig>  in the knockdown plants are described here to represent our observations of these  <dig> knockdown plants . we used semi-quantitative rt-pcr to assess the knockdown efficiency of the vigs system  and western blot analysis to determine the accumulation of bamv coat protein in the inoculated leaves. results indicate that mrna levels of the fnr gene were reduced to 47% that of the control plants . western blot analysis of bamv coat protein detected a nearly two-fold accumulation in  <dig> dpi samples in these plants . the mrna levels of the cca gene were reduced to 76%  in the knockdown plants  leading to a reduction in the accumulation of coat protein to 63% that of the control plants . these results suggest that fnr might play a role preventing the accumulation of bamv, whereas cca could facilitate the accumulation of bamv.

dsignificance: asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared with the control plants 

among the  <dig> genes analyzed , we found that the levels of accumulated coat protein significantly increased in six knockdown plants suggesting that these six genes play a role in counteracting bamv infection . three knockdown plants showed a significant reduction in the level of coat protein, implying that these three genes play a positive role in the accumulation of bamv in plants. no statistically significant difference was shown between the six remaining knockdown plants and the control plants when inoculated with bamv. interestingly, all of the genes playing a potentially negative role in the accumulation of bamv within the categories related to cell rescue, defense, death, ageing, signal transduction, and energy. these results suggest that the proteins involved in signal transduction pathways related to pathogen defense might be involved in resistance to bamv in n. benthamiana plants. finally, approximately three-fifths of the  <dig> randomly picked, differentially expressed genes showed either a positive or a negative influence on the accumulation of bamv in plants.

discussion
the arabidopsis genetic system is a common choice for the identification of plant genes involved in the interactions with plant-pathogens. lately, other genomic-scale methods, such as cdna-aflp, serial analysis of gene expression, cdna microarray, and proteomics have been developed to study the interactions associated with plant-pathogens  <cit> . among these, cdna-aflp is useful in detecting differentially expressed genes when genome sequence or microarray data is unavailable  <cit> . this method employs two restriction enzymes to generate short fragments in the analysis of aflp. the choice of restriction enzyme depends on the complexity of the target templates  <cit> . commonly, cleavage in cdna templates involves the use of four-base cutter enzymes to generate fragments of ideal sizes . because of the relatively low complexity of the cdna, two selective bases for each primer enabled  <dig> possible primer combinations  <cit> . with commercially available resources and a few modifications, a high-throughput gene expression detection system can be easily established  <cit> .

in this study, we used eight pairs of primers in the cdna-aflp analysis, to isolate  <dig> differentially expressed genes in bamv-inoculated plants. however, one of the major drawbacks of this technique is that each banding from the aflp reaction could comprise more than one cdna fragment. therefore, it is important to confirm differential expression of the targets identified by cdna-aflp, using techniques such as real time rt-pcr, semi-quantitative rt-pcr, or northern blotting. three different batches of mrnas  were extracted from n. benthamiana plants prepared independently to reduce the risk of false positive results. another drawback was that the sequencing of the genome of n. benthamiana, the experimental plant used in this study, is not yet complete. many cdna fragments of n. benthamiana identified by the cdna-aflp analysis had no significant match in the database. although a work around approach is available, in which arabidopsis or rice is used as the host plant, n. bentamiana is still a more suitable organism for the study of bamv life cycle. furthermore, host gene expressions in n. benthamiana can be knocked down by the vigs systems  <cit>  to determine whether these differentially expressed genes have any influence on the accumulation of bamv.

knocking down the expression levels of these host genes using the vigs system enables the identification of the novel functions of genes in pathogen-host interactions. fnr is down regulated upon infection with bamv . the leaves of frn knockdown plants display discoloration similar to that induced by bamv infection in control plants , suggesting that fnr may be involved in the development of viral symptoms. fnr may also be a gene associated with innate plant immunity capable of suppressing the accumulation of bamv, as suggested by the observation that fnr knockdown plants shows elevated levels of viral products compared to infected control plants. on the other hand, the expression of the cca, which catalyzes reversible hydration of co <dig> in plants, down regulates in response to infection with bamv. future investigations could test the hypothesis that fnr is a gene associated with innate immunity by studying plants that transiently or permanently over-express fnr, to evaluate the effects of higher levels of host fnr on the replication of bamv. lower levels of accumulated bamv were detected in cca knockdown plants , suggesting that cca could be recruited by bamv to facilitate viral replication. examination of the effects of cca over-expression on bamv replication in plants would test this hypothesis.

acag <dig> is another potential pathogen defense gene enhancing the accumulation of bamv coat protein approximately  <dig> folds, when knocked down in n. benthamiana plants. we have predicted that acag <dig> is a nuclear-encoded polymerase  interacting-protein  containing three transmembrane domains and one ring-h <dig> domain. the ring domain is reported to interact with e3-ubiquitin ligases mediating ubiquitination and degradation of the protein by the proteasome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the vigs system helps to identify the roles of differentially expressed genes associated with bamv infection. we have succeeded in establishing a cdna-aflp system to help track the changes involved in gene expression patterns in n. benthamiana plants during viral infection. in total,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were uncovered using eight primer pairs in the analysis in bamv-infected n. benthamiana. combining both cdna-aflp and vigs methodologies, makes the screening of large numbers of genes possible, to identify those playing a critical role in plant virus infection. in this report,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes analyzed exhibited either a positive or a negative influence on the accumulation of bamv in n. benthamiana plants.
