BACKGROUND
development and maintenance of adult tissues and organs is orchestrated by a pool of resident stem/progenitor cells which are required to meet the needs of tissue remodeling and regeneration associated with physiological and pathological states. understanding the molecular basis of stem/progenitor maintenance during mammary gland development is of substantial interest given the physiologically critical role of the organ, the dynamic nature of the organ with dramatic changes during sexual and reproductive cycles, and the extremely high prevalence of cancer of mammary gland  <cit> . mammary transplant studies have established the existence of multipotent mammary stem cells  in the adult mammary gland, with a remarkable capacity to regenerate a functional organ  <cit> . more recently, fluorescence-activated cell sorting  analyses, based on cell surface markers , has allowed for enrichment of mascs with mammary gland regenerative potential  <cit> . transplant of a single masc isolated using these approaches can generate a functional mammary gland comprised of both major mammary epithelial cell lineages: luminal and myoepithelial cells  <cit> . recent reports, however, have suggested caution in assigning masc function based on mammary gland regenerative potential in transplantation assays as it may not fully correlate with masc function in situ  <cit> . these studies suggest the need to verify the transplant-based conclusions using more definitive in situ lineage tracing studies.

studies using gene knockout or transgenic expression, lineage tracing and regenerative models have led to the identification of a number of molecular pathways that control mammary development by impinging on mascs and/or progenitor cell populations. such studies have demonstrated the role of notch, wnt, and lgr <dig> in mammary gland developmental decisions  <cit> .

we have previously described the in vitro propagation of immortalized human mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cell lines that can be induced to differentiate along the luminal or myoepithelial pathway depending on media conditions  <cit> . an rna expression screen of parental cells vs. their myoepithelial progeny identified a number of genes whose expression was restricted to bipotent parental cells. here, we focus on one of these candidate genes, sox <dig>  which is a high mobility group box transcription factor that has been demonstrated to play critical roles during embryogenesis and in the development, differentiation, and lineage commitment of a number of organ system  <cit> . genetic studies have implicated sox <dig> in the maintenance of stem or progenitor cells in the hair follicle, liver, pancreas, and intestine  <cit> . these findings, together with our human masc vs. myoepithelial cell expression profiling  <cit> , suggest that sox <dig> may physiologically regulate mammary gland development and mammary stem/progenitor cell function. indeed, in a recent study ectopic expression of sox <dig> together with slug was shown to be sufficient in reprograming mature luminal mammary epithelial cells into mascs while sox <dig> expression by itself converted these cells into luminal progenitors  <cit> .

collectively, the findings presented above are consistent with a physiological role of sox <dig> in mammary development and masc homeostasis. however, this has not been directly tested. here, we describe studies using mammary gland-directed conditional knockout  of sox <dig> together with sox9-cre-mediated activation of reporters for lineage tracing to directly establish a novel role of sox <dig> in mammary gland development and maintenance of mammary stem and luminal progenitor cells.

RESULTS
conditional sox <dig> deletion results in defective mammary gland development
we have previously characterized immortal human mammary epithelial lines that indefinitely maintain stem/progenitor cell characteristics in vitro and these can be induced to differentiate into luminal or myoepithelial progeny  <cit> . whole genome rna expression differences between parental cells and their myoepithelial progeny identified sox <dig> as one of the transcription factors enriched in undifferentiated parental cells . knockdown of sox <dig> using shrna showed its requirement for the proliferation of these stem/progenitor cell lines . to further explore the role of sox <dig> in a mouse model, we isolated mouse mammary epithelial cells from sox9fl/fl mice and induced the complete deletion of sox <dig> in vitro by infecting these cells with an adenovirus expressing cre-gfp or only gfp as a control) . in keeping with human mammary stem/progenitor cell line results, in vitro deletion of sox <dig> in mouse mammary epithelial cells resulted in a profound inhibition of proliferation as compared to control cells .

to examine the physiological consequence of sox <dig> deletion in the mammary gland, we crossed sox9fl/fl mice  <cit>  with mouse mammary tumor virus - cre mice, which have been established to promote gene deletion in the epithelial compartments of the mammary gland  <cit> . mmtv-cre; sox9fl/fl pups allow for mammary gland specific deletion, allowing an analysis of the impact of sox <dig> deletion on mammary gland development.

the mouse mammary gland undergoes substantial developmental changes during early postnatal life  <cit> . comparison of whole mounts of mouse mammary glands derived from three-week old sox <dig> cko mice revealed clear developmental defects . compared to control mammary glands, the cko mammary gland growth was stunted with substantially less ductal outgrowths and side branching. the cko mammary gland development continued to lag at 5 weeks of age, with considerably less secondary ductal branching. notably, however, cko mammary glands at 8 weeks  displayed minimal or no defects in ductal branching or the extent of overall growth . furthermore, the increased branching and alveologenesis associated with pregnancy and lactation in sox <dig> cko was comparable to that of control mice . thus, the sox <dig> cko mice show a delay in the development of the mammary gland with a pronounced early phenotype followed by an apparent recovery.figure  <dig>

sox <dig> is essential for mouse mammary stem and luminal progenitor cell function
the gradual recovery of the developmental phenotype seen in sox <dig> cko mammary glands beyond 8 weeks of age is suggestive of either a transient role of sox <dig>  or an inability of sox9-null stem/progenitors to contribute to progeny and compensation by stem/progenitors that did not undergo cre-mediated sox <dig> deletion due to mosaic mmtv-cre mediated gene deletion. we therefore analyzed the expression of mmtv-cre in our bi-transgenic mice. the mammary glands of control mice  showed that cre expression is indeed mosaic, with expression in ~50% of epithelial cells throughout development . importantly, the proportion of cre-expressing epithelial cells in the sox <dig> cko mammary glands was markedly diminished . at 3 weeks, when the developmental delay is most pronounced, there is a small percentage of cre expressing cells. however, the proportion of cre- expressing mammary epithelial cells is further diminished by 5 weeks, and we were unable to find any such cells in 8-week old sox <dig> cko mice, while such cells were abundant in the age matched control mice . the gradual loss of cre-expressing mammary epithelial cells in cko mice supports the conclusion that sox <dig> expression is critical for mammary gland development and that sox <dig> deleted cells are incapable of contributing to further mammary gland development.figure  <dig>

unfortunately, direct staining of sox <dig> was not possible due to non-specific staining within the mammary gland. we tested several anti-sox <dig> antibodies  but were unable to detect specific sox <dig> staining in luminal cells. the antibodies tested showed either no reactivity in western blotting or ihc staining, or non-specific reactivity within the myoepithelial cells  . the most commonly used antibody in the literature   <cit>  also showed non-specific reactivity with myoepithelial cells in both western blotting and immunofluorescence assays .

lineage tracing reveals that sox9-expressing cells are precursors of both luminal and basal mammary epithelial compartments, and suggests a role of sox <dig> in the maintenance of luminal progenitor pool
sox <dig> has been established to play key developmentally regulated roles in the maintenance of stem or progenitor compartments as well as lineage differentiation in many tissues and organs  <cit> . while analyses using ectopic sox <dig> expression or knockdown are consistent with a similar functional role of sox <dig> in mammary gland development, experimental evidence for any such roles in vivo is currently lacking. our findings that mammary gland development is delayed in mmtv-cre driven sox <dig> cko mice  strongly suggested a potential role of sox <dig> function in mascs and/or lineage-restricted progenitors. to experimentally assess this, we carried out lineage-tracing analyses to determine if sox <dig> expressing cells give rise to mature mammary lineages. for this purpose, we crossed the sox9-creert <dig> mice, which express a tamoxifen-inducible creert <dig> fusion under the control of sox <dig> promoter   <cit>  with either cag-egfp or rosa26-lacz reporter mice  <cit> .

tamoxifen was administered to adult virgin  sox9-creert2; r26r-lacz or sox9-creert2; cag-egfp mice and mammary glands were analyzed after 72 hours. at 72 hours post-induction, analysis of tissue sections for gfp+ cells was seen almost exclusively in the luminal compartment . flow cytometry analyses are concordant with this finding, as the vast majority of gfp+ cells  resided within the cd24hi luminal compartment . notably, gfp+ population represents only a fraction of the luminal compartment , suggesting that the sox9+ cell progeny seen at this time may correspond to an intrinsic subpopulation within the luminal compartment. we hypothesized that this intrinsic subpopulation may represent luminal progenitors within the mammary gland.figure  <dig> 
short-term linage tracing shows that sox <dig> is exclusively expressed in luminal cells. . sox9-creert2; cag-egfp mice were injected with tamoxifen. 72 hr after injection, the mice were sacrificed for mammary gland staining and facs analysis. sections of the mouse mammary gland were stained with gfp  and myoepithelial cell marker   antibodies and dapi .  flow cytometry analysis of cd <dig> expression of gfp-positive and -negative cells isolated from above tamoxifen treated mouse mammary glands. . flow cytometry analysis of all cd24+ luminal cells  isolated from the above tamoxifen treated mouse mammary glands using cd <dig> and cd49f expression. this demonstrates that luminal cells of the mammary gland are comprised of cd61+ luminal progenitors and cd61- differentiated luminal cells. . cd <dig>  cd49f flow cytometry analysis of only gfp+ cells isolated from above tamoxifen treated mouse mammary glands shows that gfp+ cells are mostly cd61+ luminal progenitors.  cd <dig>  cd <dig> flow cytometry analysis of gfp positive cells isolated from above tamoxifen treated mouse mammary glands.



to further assess the nature of the sox9+ cells within the luminal compartment, we examined the co-expression of cd <dig>  a marker of luminal progenitors, on the cd24hi luminal population  <cit> . when analyzing all cd24hi  cells, we find that there are distinct cd61hi and cd61lo populations . however, when analyzing only the cd24hi;gfp+ population  we find that the vast majority of gfp+ cells reside within the cd61hi luminal progenitor subpopulation . these results support the conclusion that sox <dig> is expressed within the luminal progenitor population. notably, when analyzing the cd24hi;gfp+ population, we did observe a small fraction of gfp+ cells within the cd24lo/cd29hi compartment  that is known to include bipotent mascs  <cit> .

to determine if sox <dig> expressing cells represented bipotent mascs with an ability to differentiate into multiple cell lineages, we performed long term lineage tracing experiments by administered tamoxifen to these mice and harvesting the mammary glands after 4 weeks. staining of histological sections showed that after 4 weeks of propagation, sox <dig> expressing progeny  made up a proportion of both luminal and myoepithelial layers . this result was more clearly established by immunofluorescence staining for gfp together with anti-smooth muscle actin  which helps demarcate the myoepithelial  and luminal  layers . both sma+gfp+ and sma-gfp+ cells were observed suggesting a common ancestry. we also prepared single-cell suspensions of harvested mammary glands and subjected these to flow cytometry to analyze the distribution of gfp+ cells within the cd24hi  and cd24lo  mammary epithelial compartments, the latter including myoepithelial cells and mascs  <cit> . a substantial fraction of both basal and luminal compartments was gfp+ , indicating that sox9-expressing precursors gave rise to both of the major mammary epithelial compartments. dual staining for cd <dig> and cd <dig> showed that gfp+ progeny included both cd61hi luminal progenitors and cd61lo differentiated luminal cells .figure  <dig>

finally, we also performed an independent long-term lineage-trace using a non-inducible sox9-cre knock-in mouse model  <cit>  to assess the contribution of sox9+ cells to mature lineages. for this purpose, we generated sox9-cre; cag-egfp bi-transgenic mice  <cit> . analysis of whole mount mammary glands demonstrated uniform gfp expression throughout the mammary ductal system in adult virgin  sox9-cre; cag-egfp mice . immunofluorescence analyses of mammary gland sections stained for gfp and myoepithelial marker sma revealed uniform gfp expression in both luminal and myoepithelial layers . collectively, our lineage-tracing results demonstrate that sox9-expressing cells function as precursors of all mature lineages as well as luminal progenitors, consistent with the functional role of sox <dig> in bipotent mascs and luminal progenitors.figure  <dig> 
non-inducible long-term linage tracing shows that sox <dig> is expressed in luminal and myoepithelial cells. a non-inducible sox9-cre knock-in mouse model was used to assess the contribution of sox9+ cells to mature lineages. sox9-cre mice were crossed with cag-egfp mice. sox9-cre; cag-egfp mammary gland cut sections were stained with anti-gfp  and α-sma  antibodies. dapi staining is blue.  gfp staining shows sox <dig> expressing cells contribute to both luminal and myoepithelial lineages.  α-sma  is used to highlight the myoepithelial cells.



lineage-tracing analyses of sox <dig> cko mice show loss of sox9-null progeny in the luminal but not in the basal/myoepithelial compartment
to determine the fate of mammary epithelial precursors in which sox <dig> was deleted using mmtv-cre, we used further crosses to incorporate the cag-egfp and rosa-lacz reporters into mmtv-cre; sox9fl/fl strain. as we observed depletion of cre-expressing cells in both luminal and myoepithelial compartments of 8-week old mmtv-cre-driven sox <dig> conditional ko mice , we anticipated the lineage-trace to show an absence of sox9-null progeny in both mammary cell compartments. however, whole mount analysis showed uniform lacz and gfp staining throughout the mammary glands of  <dig> and 8 week old mice . notably, lacz or gfp staining of histological sections revealed that the progeny of sox <dig> deleted precursors was restricted to the basal/myoepithelial layer with essentially complete absence from the luminal compartment . facs analyses demonstrated that gfp+ progeny was present in both luminal and basal compartments in the control  mice . in contrast, the mammary glands of mice with mmtv-driven sox <dig> deletion showed a near complete absence of gfp+  progeny in the luminal compartment , consistent with staining results . these results suggest that myoepithelial progeny of sox9-deleted precursors are viable while their luminal progeny is not.figure  <dig>

discussion
sox <dig> has been established as a key regulator of tissue stem and progenitor cells during development in several organ systems  <cit> , more recently has been linked to cancer stem cell function  <cit> . a potential role of sox <dig> in regulating mammary stem/progenitor cell functions has emerged from recent studies using ectopic expression and analyses of breast cancer cell lines. however, a physiological role of sox <dig> in mammary gland development and mammary stem/progenitor cells remains unknown. here, we use a conditional gene deletion approach to provide in situ evidence for a physiological role of sox <dig> as an important regulator of mammary gland development. we also carried out short and long term lineage-tracing analyses to implicate a role for sox <dig> in the maintenance of mammary stem cells and luminal progenitors.

our conclusion that sox <dig> is an essential component of the mammary gland developmental program is based on a substantial delay in post-natal mammary gland ductal elongation and branching in mice with mmtv-cre directed sox <dig> deletion . the defects in development are particularly severe at early time points  but are followed by gradual recovery, with essential no defects beyond 8 weeks of age. we hypothesized that recovery from the developmental block imposed by sox <dig> deletion is overcome by the expansion of mammary epithelial cells in which sox <dig> deletion did not occur, due to the known mosaic expression of mmtv-cre that we used . unfortunately, direct sox <dig> staining was not possible due to lack of specific anti-sox <dig> antibodies. several antibodies that we tested showed either no or non-specific reactivity in western blotting, ihc, if . consequently, we used cre expression as a surrogate for sox <dig> deletion and found that sox <dig> deleted cells are lost in cko mice by 8 weeks . accordingly, no subsequent defects in mammary gland development were observed during pregnancy and lactation. these results suggest that sox <dig> deletion puts the precursors of mammary epithelium at a developmental disadvantage. our efforts at conditional sox <dig> deletion in the mammary gland using a k14-cre, which is active during embryonic mammary placode stage  <cit> , were not feasible due to perinatal lethality of the successfully targeted mice. however, the absence of mammary gland in a rare short-term survivor confirmed conclusions reached based on the use of mmtv-cre driven sox <dig> knockout mice . our results are reminiscent of more severe phenotypes of gene deletion using k14-cre vs. mmtv-cre, reported for gata- <dig> deletion  <cit> . the inducible model presented here provides a tractable system to further examine the cellular and molecular basis of sox <dig> function in the mammary gland.

in view of the importance of sox <dig> in mammary gland development revealed by our conditional knockout studies, we considered the possibility that sox <dig> is important for the function of mammary stem/progenitor populations as these are the sources of developmental growth and expansion of the mammary gland. to test this possibility in an unbiased manner, we carried out lineage-tracing studies using a sox9-directed cre to turn on reporters that allowed us to track the progeny of sox9-expressing precursor populations. when such studies were carried throughout embryonic development , all mammary epithelial cells, including the luminal and myoepithelial/basal cell layers, were uniformly positive for reporter expression . in keeping with this result, a four week chase following induction of a tamoxifen-inducible sox9-creert <dig> driver in postnatal mice led to the appearance of the progeny of sox9-expressing precursors in both luminal and myoepithelial/basal cell populations of the mammary gland . these studies suggest that sox <dig> expression marks an early bi-potent mascs, however, we cannot preclude the possibility that sox <dig> may be expressed in both luminal and myoepithelial restricted progenitors. in view of the defects in mammary development upon sox <dig> deletion , we suggest that sox <dig> is an important regulator of the developmental program of mascs. furthermore, we have previously published a report of isolating and immortalizing a human masc line that is able to differentiate into the myoepithelial lineage  <cit> . western blot data confirms that sox <dig> expression is markedly higher in immortal human masc lines vs. their progeny differentiated along the myoepithelial lineage . furthermore, sox <dig> deletion results in inhibition of proliferation in in both human mammary epithelial and mouse mammary epithelial cells .

several recent studies support our conclusion that sox <dig> provides a critical function in maintaining mascs. for example, ectopic co-expression of sox <dig> and slug reprogramed mature luminal mammary epithelial cells into mascs capable of generating mammary gland-like growths upon transplant  <cit> . down-regulation of wnt-1-induced signaling protein- <dig>  in relatively well-differentiated mcf <dig> breast cancer cell line promoted a cancer stem-like cell phenotype with upregulation of sox <dig>  <cit> . in another study, expression of mir- <dig>  which targeted sox <dig> directly, was seen to be lower in breast cancer patients and cancer stem cells and was associated with increased sox <dig> expression  <cit> . high sox <dig> expression in basal-like breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and activation of wnt/β-catenin pathway, and sox <dig> silencing reduced cell proliferation and invasion  <cit> . furthermore, overexpression in cell lines increased wnt signaling transgenic overexpression in murine mammary glands increased secondary ductal branching  <cit> . as sox <dig> is a wnt target in other stem cell systems  <cit> , and accumulating evidence suggest a key role of wnt/β-catenin pathway in the maintenance of mascs  <cit> , it is reasonable to postulate that sox <dig> is an important component of masc maintenance by wnt/β-catenin and potentially other pathways.

notably, two significant findings in our study imply a more important role of sox <dig> in the regulation of luminal progenitors. first, short term lineage-tracing almost exclusively marked the luminal mammary epithelial layer, and facs analyses using cd <dig> confirmed the marked population to be luminal progenitors . second, when we carried out lineage tracing in the context of sox <dig> deletion induced by mmtv-cre, we noted that progeny of sox9-deleted precursors was absent from the luminal epithelial compartment but such cells were still present within the myoepithelial/basal compartment and may represent the progeny of restricted myoepithelial progenitors that underwent sox <dig> deletion . these results suggest that sox <dig> function may be particularly critical for the development of the luminal lineage. selective labeling of luminal progenitors upon short-term tracing is consistent with this conclusion. this idea is further supported by recent findings that ectopic sox <dig> expression in mature mammary epithelial cells converts these into cells expressing markers of luminal progenitors  <cit> .

taken together, the findings presented in this paper demonstrate a physiological role of sox <dig> in mammary gland development. our results, considered in light of recent publications, implicate sox <dig> as a key regulator of the maintenance of mammary stem cells and luminal progenitors. with emerging evidence that sox <dig> may contribute to maintenance of breast cancer stem cells, the inducible sox <dig> deletion model and the insights presented here should facilitate future efforts to validate sox <dig> as a biomarker or therapeutic target in breast cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this study, we show that sox <dig> expression is restricted to luminal progenitors and bipotent basal stem/progenitor cells in the postnatal mouse mammary gland. long-term lineage tracing studies demonstrated that sox9+ precursors give rise to both luminal and myoepithelial cell lineages. conditional knockout of sox <dig> in the mouse mammary gland results in impaired postnatal development. in vitro knockout sox <dig> impaired mouse mammary epithelial proliferation. indicate sox <dig> is an essential regulator of mouse mammary stem/progenitor cells.
