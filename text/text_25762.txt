BACKGROUND
atopic dermatitis , a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with cutaneous hyper-reactivity, affects approximately 3% of infants, 10 ~ 20% of children and 1 ~ 3% of adults worldwide  <cit> . this systemic disorder is caused by skin barrier dysfunction, severe skin dehydration, and mutations in the filaggrin gene, which has an essential role in modulating epidermal homeostasis. the skin lesions of ad are generally characterized by infiltration with various inflammatory cells such as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and t cells  <cit> .

activated mast cells release a variety of inflammatory mediators following cross-linking of immunoglobulin e -receptor complexes at the high-affinity ige receptor i . of these mediators, histamine is generally considered as a marker of mast cell degranulation in immediate allergic reaction and is a violent inducer of itching. histamine is a characteristic major mediator in mast cell storage granules and directly triggers type i allergic responses  <cit> .

thymic stromal lymphopoietin  is produced mainly by epidermal keratinocytes, as well as dermal fibroblasts and mast cells in the skin lesions of acute and chronic ad  <cit> . it strongly promotes dendritic cell  maturation in the epidermis or can initiate and regulate the allergic inflammation reaction  <cit> . moreover, tslp can stimulate naive t cell to express pro-inflammatory cytokines   <cit> .

regulatory t cells  play a key role in various immune responses, including type  <dig> helper t cells -mediated diseases, such as ad. tregs are found in lymph nodes, skin lesions, spleen or peripheral blood and maintain peripheral immune homeostasis and tolerance to allergens. they also prevent or suppress differentiation, proliferation and function of various immune cells, including cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, through a process dependent on cell-cell contact, il- <dig>  or transforming growth factor   <cit> . exhaustion of cd25+ cells can aggravate th <dig> cell-mediated inflammation induced by various antigens  <cit> . tregs express high cd <dig> levels at the cell surface and cd <dig> has been identified as a marker of tregs. however, cd25hi expression is regarded as an activation marker rather than a normal marker of tregs because cd <dig> expression on tregs increases after sensitization with antigens  <cit> . the expression of forkhead box protein  <dig> , which is a key regulator of treg development, has been identified as a specific treg marker. foxp3+ t cells can inhibit the activation or proliferation of various immune cells, including th <dig>  th <dig> and th <dig> cells  <cit> .

several previous studies have examined the anti-allergic effects of fish oil. fish oil intake can reduce sensitization to allergens, alleviate the severity of ad, eczema, and asthma, and down-regulate the expression of il- <dig>  - <dig>  and − <dig> and ifn-γ in serum  <cit> . fish oil contains various omega- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acid , such as eicosapentaenoic acid  and docosahexaenoic acid   <cit> . epa inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines , up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines , and increases the number of foxp3+ tregs  <cit> . dha diminishes the proliferation of effector t cells by increasing mrna expression of foxp <dig>  tgf-β and il- <dig> from tregs  <cit> .

recent studies have investigated the anti-allergic effects of fermented food products such as yogurt, cheese, and soybean paste on a variety of allergic reactions, diabetes and some cancers  <cit> . fermentation can transmute the chemical structure of some constituents to create new substances. the beneficial effects of natural fish oil  have been described in many diseases, but the mechanism by which fermented fish oil  modulates the immune system and the allergic response is poorly understood. in this study, we produced ffo and found that ingestion of this fish oil resulted in suppression of various allergic reactions and factors and increased the differentiation of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ t cells from cd4+ t cells.

RESULTS
ffo suppresses causative factors in pruritus
to induce experimental ad, mice received an initial sensitization with 1% dinitrochlorobenzene  on the abdomen, followed by sensitization with  <dig> % dncb on their ears every other day for up to  <dig> days. starting on day  <dig>  the mice were given  <dig> mg/kg of ffo or nfo orally every day. on day  <dig>  all mice were sacrificed . itching is a critical factor in the maintenance of ad symptoms and affects skin edema. therefore, we tested whether ffo or nfo has a therapeutic effect on pruritus. mice with experimental ad were given ffo or nfo  every day, and the mice were painted with hydrocort cream every other day. we measured the number of scratches in a  <dig> min period on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in the induction group, the number of scratches increased in a time-dependent manner. also, on day  <dig>  ffo and hydrocort cream treatment significantly decreased  scratching behavior .

ige is an important therapeutic target for allergy and ad as it is the major mechanism for activating mast cells to release histamine  <cit> . therefore, we measured serum ige and histamine levels in mice with dermatitis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . the ffo or nfo-treated group showed significantly decreased ige  and histamine  levels compared with the induction group. in addition, ffo treatment had a stronger inhibitory effect than nfo on allergic symptoms .

histological features of ear tissue and tslp hyperproduction in dncb-challenged mice
the skin lesions of ad are characterized by infiltration of various inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, granulocytes, and t cells  <cit> . therefore, we tested whether administration of ffo or nfo alleviates inflammatory cell infiltration in the ears of mice with experimental ad. cutaneous edema as a measure of ad progression was also measured. administration of ffo  or nfo  reduced ear thickness; the ffo-treated group was not appreciably different from the hydrocort cream treatment group . the effect of ffo and nfo treatment on infiltration of inflammatory cells into the ear tissue was monitored by hematoxylin and eosin  staining. the ffo and nfo-treated group showed significantly decreased epidermal thickness and inflammatory cell infiltration such as cd3+ cells compared with the induction group . 

tslp produced by epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts and mast cells can activate the maturation of dendritic cells and regulate allergic inflammation reactions. therefore, we measured the expression of tslp in ad mice models using ihc and western blot. the increased tslp expression was significantly inhibited in the ffo group . although both fish oils inhibited various feature of ad mice models, ffo administration showed stronger inhibitory effects than nfo on cutaneous edema, cd3+ t cell infiltration and tslp hyperproduction.

ffo administration regulates the expression of ad-associated cytokines and the foxp <dig> transcription factor
t cells produce a variety of cytokines. th <dig> cells are characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines such as ifn-γ and il- <dig> and th <dig> cells are characterized by the production of various cytokines including il- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig>  among these cytokines, il- <dig> plays a crucial role in allergic responses and in the differentiation from naive t cell to th <dig> cell. il- <dig> also induces isotype switching of b cells to produce ige  <cit> . we measured whether ffo affects the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in dncb-induced dermatitis, which is characterized as a th <dig> inflammatory disorder. the expression of ad-associated inflammatory factors such as th <dig>  and th <dig>  cytokines was measured in the ear tissues of dncb-stimulated mice by real-time pcr. in the induction group, the il- <dig> level was extremely elevated. both ffo and nfo decreased the expression of il- <dig> compared with the induction group ; the effect of ffo was not appreciably different from that of nfo . ingestion of ffo reduced il- <dig>  and ifn-γ  mrna levels compared with the nfo-treated group . we also measured the effects of ffo and nfo on the expression of tgf-β and foxp <dig>  both of which induce the proliferation and differentiation of tregs. ffo treatment increased the expression of tgf-β and foxp <dig> compared with nfo group  . 

ffo attenuates the function of mature th1/ <dig> cells in experimental immune disorders
the spleen plays important roles in the active immune system through the cell-mediated pathway, especially through the activity of mature t and b cells  <cit> . therefore, we observed the morphologic features of the spleen. mice in induction group showed a highly enlarged spleen. ffo and nfo treatment resulted in a smaller spleen size with reduced the thickness and length compared to the induction group, and the ffo group had a smaller spleen than the nfo group . 

we measured whether ffo or nfo suppresses mature th <dig> and th <dig> cell functions in the experimental ad models. splenocytes from each group were stimulated with anti-cd <dig>  and anti-cd <dig>  for  <dig> days. the relative levels of ifn-γ and il- <dig> cytokines were measured by elisa and the expression of the th <dig> t-box-expressed-in-t-cell  and th <dig> gata-binding protein  <dig>  transcription factors was measured by facs. spleen cells from mice treated with ffo and nfo produced significantly less il- <dig> and ifn-γ compared with the induction group following stimulation with anti-cd3/cd <dig> . in addition, ingestion of ffo or nfo decreased t-bet expression from  <dig> % of splenocytes  to  <dig> %  or  <dig> %  and decreased gata <dig> expression from  <dig> % of splenocytes  to  <dig> %  or  <dig> % . the ffo group exhibited stronger anti-inflammatory effects on effector t cell inflammatory factors than the nfo group .

ffo administration increases the differentiation of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg
the administration of ffo significantly reduced the progression of experimental ad model by inhibiting various inflammatory processes. tregs play a key role in various immune responses in preventing or suppressing differentiation, proliferation and function of various immune cells including cd4+ t cells. therefore, we analyzed whether administration of ffo or nfo affects the production of factors related to the generation of tregs. ffo or nfo  was fed to normal balb/c mice for  <dig> days and all mice were sacrificed on day  <dig> . splenocytes from each group were analyzed without any stimulation. the administration of ffo did not affect foxp <dig> expression levels and the number of cd25+foxp3+ tregs  compared with the normal or nfo group. however, the ffo group did have significantly increased expression of treg-associated anti-inflammatory factors tgf-β and il- <dig> compared with the nfo group  .

the above results suggest that the activity of tregs was somehow enhanced or altered by ffo. therefore, we analyzed whether administration of ffo or nfo increases the expression of factors related to treg differentiation during t cell activation. cd4+ t cells were isolated from splenocytes using cd4+ t cell isolation beads and were stimulated with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> for  <dig> days. ffo administration increased foxp <dig> expression  and the number of cd4+cd25+ tregs  to levels more than double that in the nfo group  . in addition, to confirm that the cells were genuine tregs, we analyzed whether administration of ffo increases the number of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs following anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> stimulation. ffo treatment increased the cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg population  to more than twice that of the nfo group , .

discussion
in this study, we fermented natural fish oil and compared the differences between ffo and nfo on the modulation of the immune system. administration of ffo potently induced the generation of cd4+cd25+ foxp3+ treg in the spleen compared with nfo treatment. increased tgf-β and foxp <dig> at sites of inflammation was associated with elevated cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg populations, which can down-regulate the progression of experimental immune disorders. the ingestion of ffo generated regulatory t cell populations.

ad mainly appears together with a variety of diseases such as eczema, asthma and allergic conjunctivitis. the symptoms of ad include pruritus, peripheral eosinophilia, epidermal hyperplasia and tissue remodeling, such as spongiosis.

in the present study, we used the dncb-induced experimental ad mouse model to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of ffo or nfo. ige is an important target in the treatment of allergy, and signaling through fcεri can induce histamine release from mast cells, which leads to potent induction of pruritus. scratching behavior is a typical consequence of pruritus and aggravates the symptoms of dermatological diseases such as ad. therefore, we tested whether ffo or nfo can reduce scratching behaviors, serum histamine, ige hyperproduction and cutaneouse edema. the administration of ffo or nfo decreased scratching behavior, ige, histamine levels and edema compared with the induction group . we predicted that the decreased ige and histamine levels after ffo or nfo treatment would lead to alleviation of pruritus and cutaneous edema. h&e staining and ihc of the ear tissue confirmed that ingestion of ffo or nfo alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration  and expression of tslp compared with the induction group . furthermore, the ffo treatment had stronger inhibitory effects than nfo treatment on most of these signs of allergic disease.

ad is generally characterized by increased numbers of activated cd4+ or cd8+ t cells, and enormous numbers of infiltrating cd4+ t cells in the dermis. in the majority of patients, ad is primarily associated with a dysfunction of the body’s immune. in particular, il- <dig> plays a crucial role in allergic responses and the differentiation of th <dig> cells from naïve t cells  <cit> . thus, we assessed whether ffo or nfo has anti-inflammatory effects on ad model, which is a th2-mediated immune disorder. the induction group had extremely elevated il- <dig> levels, which were decreased in the ffo and nfo groups. in addition, ingestion of ffo markedly reduced il- <dig> and ifn-γ levels and increased the expression of specific treg cells markers  compared with nfo group in dncb-stimulated atopic dermatitis mice model . based on these results, we concluded that ffo and nfo have potent anti-inflammatory properties, although the activity of ffo was greater than that of nfo. increased expression of tgf-β and foxp <dig> by ffo treatment at the sites of inflammation could reflect the increased number of foxp3+ tregs.

the spleen plays an important role in regulating the immune system and contains a range of immune cells. also, enlared spleen means a splenomegaly by abnormality of immune system function. we observed the morphologic features of the spleen in ad model. the induction group had markedly enlarged spleens; spleen size was reduced in the ffo and nfo-treated groups. mice in the ffo group had smaller spleens than mice in the nfo group . so, ffo reduced enlarged spleen by alleviating abnormality of immune system function. th <dig> cells produce a variety of cytokines, such as il- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig>  and preferentially express gata <dig>  which is important for th <dig> differentiation. th <dig> cells produce ifn-γ and the transcription factor  is critical for the differentiation of th <dig> cells  <cit> . we measured whether ffo and nfo ingestion regulate the expression of th1/th <dig> associated factors in experimental ad model. ffo and nfo decreased ifn-γ and il- <dig> levels and the expression of t-bet and gata <dig> .

how does ffo suppress a variety of immune response in dncb-stimulated experimental ad? regulatory t cells  play a key role in various immune responses, including th <dig> cell-mediated diseases such as ad, and prevent or suppress differentiation, proliferation, and function of various immune cells including cd4+ t cells in a tgf-β/il-10/cell contact-dependent manner. since all tregs express cd <dig> at the cell surface and produce the foxp <dig> transcription factor, these proteins have been identified as markers of tregs  <cit> . we analyzed whether the administration of ffo affects the expression of factors related to tregs differentiation. although ffo treatment did not increase the foxp <dig> level and there was no difference in the number of cd25+foxp3+ tregs compared to the nfo treatment group, the ffo group did show increased expression of the immune-suppressive cytokines tgf-β and il- <dig> . interestingly, ffo administration more than doubled the expression of tgf-β and foxp <dig> at the site of inflammation . therefore, we analyzed whether administration of ffo and nfo increases the expression of factors related to tregs differentiation following stimulation. ffo increased foxp <dig> level  and the cd4+cd25+ tregs population  more than two-fold compared with nfo in cd4+t cells stimulated with anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> . in addition, we analyzed whether administration of ffo or nfo increases the number of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs following stimulation. ffo treatment increased the cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs population  more than two-fold compared with nfo treatment  . as a result, ingestion of ffo significantly increased foxp <dig> expression and induced the differentiation of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs from cd4+ t cells. these results indicate that ffo is more effective than nfo in disease suppression and inducing cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs.

why does ffo show more potent anti-allergic effects than nfo? fish oil contains a variety of substances, such as stearic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, linolenic acid, epa and dha  <cit> . especially, epa and dha are mainly effective for skin inflammation. several previous studies have suggested that epa and dha diet alleviate ear oedema and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory factors  in experimental skin inflammation models  <cit> . ffo contains more than double the concentration of epa and dha . in addition, fermentation would transmute the chemical structure of some constituents of fish oil to create new substances, which have immune-modulatory activities by regulating the development of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs. 

in summary, ffo had stronger inhibitory effects on various experimental ad symptoms than nfo by up-regulating the generation of tregs. it is not yet clear why ffo has stronger immunomodulatory effects than nfo. so we are currently trying to identify the interrelationships between ffo, epa, dha and tregs. our results suggest that the anti-allergic effect of ffo is associated with the enrichment of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ treg at the site of inflammation and that fermented fish oil may be an effective treatment for the allergic symptoms of ad.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we produced fermented fish oil and tested its ability to suppress the allergic inflammatory response and to activate cd4+cd25+foxp3+ t cells. administration of ffo alleviated the allergic inflammation, and did increase the expression of the immune-suppressive cytokines tgf-β and il- <dig>  increased tgf-β and foxp <dig> by ffo was associated with regulatory t cell populations, which can down-regulate the progression of experimental immune disorders. the ingestion of ffo up-regulated the generation of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ tregs. it is not yet clear why ffo has strong immune-modulatory effects. so, we are currently trying to identify the interrelationships between omega- <dig> fatty acids and tregs. these results suggest that the anti-allergic effect of ffo is associated with enrichment of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ t cells at the inflamed sites and that ffo may be effective in treating the allergic symptoms of ad.
