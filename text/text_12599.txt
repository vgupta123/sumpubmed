BACKGROUND
habitats can have significant influences on the evolution of sexual signals  <cit> . accordingly, various environmental factors, such as food abundance, predation pressure, parasites, and other biotic/abiotic factors affect the expression of sexual signals and preferences  <cit> . sensory drive models for sexual selection can be used to investigate the effects of various environmental factors on signal perception and subsequent sexual selection  <cit> , and environmental conditions can act as transmission filters for sexual signals, leading to sexual selection that favors more detectable sexual trait variants in particular environments .

because a broad range of animals use coloration as a sexual signal, the visual system has become one of the most actively studied sensory drive systems. perception and detection for color signals are determined by several different components  <cit> . one important component is the light sensitivity of individuals for a given spectral condition of the environment. the mechanism and degree to which individuals can detect light of a certain range of wavelengths depend on the given spectral sensitivity of the individuals. for instance, the retinas of cichlid fishes inhabiting relatively blue-shifted environments are more sensitive to the blue wavelength of light than those from relatively red-shifted environments  <cit> , and these could be associated with sensory drive through female choice  <cit> . during the initial stage, such biases in sensitivity to light arise due to variations in the properties of photoreceptor cell response  <cit> . molecular mechanisms of visual perception have been well studied at the level of peripheral processing , and it is accepted that visual pigments comprise opsin proteins and chromophores  that transduce light signals in the environment into electrochemical signals in the neural system  <cit> . moreover, opsin proteins play important roles in spectral sensitivities of visual pigments. vertebrates possess five types of visual opsins: 1) rhodopsin  <dig>  responsible for dim light perception; 2) rh <dig>  the color green; 3) short wavelength-sensitive type  <dig> , ultraviolet  blue; 4) short wavelength-sensitive type  <dig> , blue; and 5) the middle-to-long wavelength-sensitive -type opsins, red–green  <cit> . specific amino acid substitutions in opsin proteins generate shifts in photoreceptor sensitivity to light wavelengths  <cit> .

in addition to amino acid substitutions, the differential gene expressions of opsins have crucial effects on spectral sensitivities of visual pigments  <cit> . differential expressions of opsin genes in different light environments have been reported in several species of fishes. for example, african cichlids in lake victoria show variations in the expression of the sws2b opsin gene across taxa, which are correlated with the spectral composition of the environment  <cit> . in bluefin killifish , individuals inhabiting springs of high water clarity and high transmission of uv and blue wavelengths exhibit higher expression of sws <dig> and sws2b opsin genes, whereas individuals inhabiting swamps where the water color is red shifted with low transmission of uv and blue wavelengths exhibit higher expression of rh <dig> and lws  <cit> .

several studies have demonstrated plastic changes in opsin gene expression according to light environments. in the bluefin killifish, differential expression of opsin genes observed across populations could be experimentally re-created. individuals raised in tea-stained treatments had higher expression levels of rh <dig> and lws, whereas those from clear-water treatments had higher expression levels of sws <dig> and sws2b  <cit> . similar plastic differentiations were observed in african cichlids from lake malawi, and the lab-reared individuals which raised in a uv-minus light environment expressed opsin genes differently from wild-caught individuals  <cit> . these studies suggest that light environments could alter the expression levels of opsin genes, which consequently affect spectral sensitivity to the light environments.

the guppy  has been an important model organism for studies of ecology, behavior, and evolution, particularly for studies of sexual selection. male guppies have highly polymorphic body color patterns, and female preference for some components of these male color patterns varies among populations in response to environmental factors . archer et al.   <cit>  and archer and lythgoe   <cit>  showed that spectral sensitivities of photoreceptor cells to middle and long wavelength ranges varied between individual guppies. subsequently, endler   <cit>  suggested that variations in visual properties contribute to differences in female preferences for male color patterns. recent molecular genetic studies also revealed that guppies carry nine opsin genes, including an ultraviolet-sensitive gene , two subtypes of blue-sensitive genes , two subtypes of green-sensitive rh <dig> genes  and, remarkably, four subtypes of red-sensitive lws genes  . for lws genes, the nomenclature of the first three genes follows  <cit>  and that of the last follows  <cit> . in addition to spectral variations among loci, studies showed allelic spectral variations in lws- <dig> opsin  <cit>  in feral populations in okinawa. moreover, an amino acid substitution in lws- <dig> opsin protein sequences was found to correspond with residue  <dig> in human m/lws opsins  , which is one of five key positions that influence wavelength sensitivity  <cit> .

moreover, expression levels of certain opsin genes reportedly vary significantly among guppies and have been associated with differences in sex and age of individuals  <cit> . sandkam et al.  <cit>  examined differences in the opsin gene expression levels among populations experiencing different predation pressures , and found that individuals inhabiting low-predation environments expressed higher levels of lws opsin genes than those inhabiting high-predation environments. female guppies show consistent preferences for carotenoid-based red and orange spots in males  <cit> , which reflect light at wavelengths >500 nm that are mainly absorbed by lws opsins  <cit> . sandkam et al.  <cit>  therefore suggested that habitat-specific visual characteristics via differential expression levels of lws opsins may result in differences in female preferences for red and orange spots. however, it remains unknown how and which environmental factors change the expression profiles of opsin expression, and whether or not these differences affect spectral sensitivities that may cause differences in color vision and subsequent female preferences.

in the present study, we determined whether light environment during development alters the expression of opsin genes, and whether these changes affect spectral sensitivities to specific light wavelengths. to this end, we assessed the effects of light environment during the juvenile stage on the levels of opsin expression in the adult stage of the guppy. previous studies of bluefin killifish   <cit>  and the cichlids in lake malawi  <cit>  showed that the expression levels of opsins could change according to the different environmental conditions. hence, adult guppies may adapt to light environments by altering spectral sensitivity during growth stages. in the present study, we correlated the expression levels of nine opsin genes with spectral sensitivities to specific light wavelengths according to optomotor behavioral responses.

discussion
in the present study, we examined the effects of light environment during growth on behavioral sensitivities to long wavelengths of light and opsin gene expression in the guppy . in these experiments, individuals maintained under orange light during growth exhibited higher expression of a long-wavelength-sensitive opsin gene  and had higher sensitivity to orange light  than did those maintained under green light. in previous studies of cichlids  <cit>  and killifishes  <cit> , light environment during growth caused plastic changes in opsin gene expression; similar plastic changes occurred in guppies in the present study. the present results indicate that changes in expression levels of opsin genes lead to changes in spectral sensitivity to orange light, although factors other than opsin gene expression, i.e., optical properties of the lens  <cit>  and connections between cone cells and neurons  <cit> , might affect the change in the spectral sensitivity. in the present study, we did not examine the effect of sex on the changes in gene expression, since there was an insufficient number of individuals for comparison; however, this effect should be examined in future studies.

changes in behavioral sensitivity to long wavelengths of light and opsin gene expression
the present results showed that sensitivities to 600-nm light were remarkably lower than those to 532-, 546-, and 570-nm light. this result potentially reflects peak absorption spectra  of opsin proteins in guppy photoreceptor cells. accordingly, 600-nm light is mainly absorbed by lws- <dig> opsin . in contrast, the other three wavelengths  could be absorbed by lws- <dig>  lws- <dig> , lws- <dig> , rh2- <dig> , and rh2- <dig>  opsins . our results of optomotor response were consistent with those by endler  <cit> , who reported decreasing sensitivities to long wavelength of light . these facts indicate that guppies are less sensitive to orange and red colors  than blue, green, and yellow colors .

the intensity levels  of light through the neutral density filter using the same lens density values varied between the four stimulus wavelengths, particularly under lower lens density values , and the light intensity levels were lower under  <dig> and 546 nm than under  <dig> and 600 nm for almost all lens densities. thus, behavioral sensitivity under 532-nm and 546-nm light might be somewhat underestimated due to an individual possibly stopping the optomotor response at a one-step higher lens density under 532/546-nm light than under 570/600-nm light. thus, if the variation of light intensity affects the results, behavioral sensitivity was predicted to be lower under 532/546-nm light than under 570/600-nm light. however, the results showed that behavioral sensitivity was higher under 532/546-nm light than under 570/600-nm light. thus, the variation did not affect the results. furthermore, we directly compared the lens density values for which optomotor responses were less than  <dig>  . the lens density values under which most individuals stop optomotor responses ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . there was a little variation in the light intensities among the four stimulus wavelengths for this range of lens density values; thus, variation in the light intensities did not greatly affect the results.

the present results indicate that different light environments during growth  affected behavioral responses to 600-nm light, but not the other three wavelengths. moreover, the light environment during growth affected the expression levels of lws- <dig>  the results of pca showed that individuals with high pc <dig> values were more sensitive to 600-nm light. positive pc <dig> values indicated higher expression of lws- <dig> and lws- <dig>  hence, plastically regulated changes in lws- <dig> and potentially expression of lws- <dig> lead to changes in the behavioral sensitivities to 600-nm light. although lws- <dig> opsin absorb little 600-nm light, individuals with high expressions of lws- <dig> and lws- <dig> showed high sensitivity to 600-nm light because the expression levels of lws- <dig> and lws- <dig> were positively correlated ; thus, the correlated increased expressions of both lws- <dig> and lws- <dig> might affect the sensitivity to long wavelengths of light. the optomotor response has been used to investigate which cone types contribute to the detection of motion, and several studies suggested that the detection of motion is mediated by one cone type only, namely the lws opsin  <cit> . thus, the ability of the detection of motion could be affected by plastic changes in the expression of lws opsins.

the estimated total sum of quantum catches by nine opsins in guppies was different under the orange and green light . thus, green light might appear brighter to guppies than orange light. there is a possibility that the difference in brightness  affects changes in opsin expression and behavioral sensitivity. however, the present results showed that the degree of changes in expression differed for the different opsin genes so that the changes in the expression of opsin genes might be affected by the relative amount of light captured by each opsin gene rather than the total amount of light. a previous study  <cit>  reported that guppies reared under low light conditions exhibited a weaker response to visual cues during foraging than those reared under higher light conditions. this shows that individuals grown under green light  might have exhibited lower optomotor responses than those grown under orange light. however, our result indicates a higher sensitivity to orange light in guppies grown under orange light. thus, the difference in brightness between the two light environments might not have a significant effect on behavioral sensitivities.

heritable and environmental effects on variations in the expression of opsins
changes in opsin expression due to phenotypic plasticity have been reported in some species, such as bluefin killifish  <cit>  and east african cichlids  <cit> . in the present study, differing light environments during growth caused plastic changes in lws opsin gene expression levels of guppies. however, there is a possibility that individual variations in opsin expression are heritable. endler  <cit>  showed that behavioral sensitivity to different colors of light could be evolved under artificial selection pressures, potentially reflecting selection for genetic variations in the levels of expression of opsin. moreover, sandkam et al.  <cit>  recently identified divergence of opsin expression across guppy populations in trinidad, potentially reflecting genetic differences. thus, further studies are required to examine the relative importance of genetic and/or environmental variation in opsin gene expression.

evolutionary implications of plastic changes in sensitivity to predominant wavelengths of light in habitat environments
the present results suggest that guppies grown in orange water environments had increased perceptions of orange light. aquatic light environments for guppies vary from clear to tannin-stained. in tannin-stained water, long wavelengths of light are more effectively transmitted than short wavelengths; therefore, these aquatic environments become orange-shifted light environments  <cit> . under these orange-shifted aquatic environments, guppies with enhanced sensitivity to the background orange lights might more effectively detect objects that are darker than background light, such as silhouettes of predators or foods  <cit> . guppies inhabit shallow watersheds with spatially and seasonally varying spectral composition  <cit> ; thus, plastic changes in sensitivity to background light environments might contribute to survival in variable light environments.

changes in sensitivity to long wavelengths of light due to expression levels of lws opsin genes may also alter preferences for orange spots. in trinidad, females from orange-shifted water showed a stronger preference for males with orange and black spots  <cit> . for females with higher sensitivity to predominant wavelengths of orange light, the color combination of “bright” orange and “dark” black spots could be perceived as high contrast under orange-shifted light environments. thus, enhanced sensitivity to environmental light owing to plastic changes in lws opsin gene expression might contribute to female preference for orange and black spots of males under orange-shifted waters. however, the present study lacked a sufficiently large sample size to assess the effects of spectral sensitivities on female preferences for orange spots. thus, further behavioral mate choice trials using individuals reared under different light conditions require investigation in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the current study indicate that individuals have higher sensitivities to environmental light conditions through plastic changes in lws opsin genes, suggesting advantages for food acquisition and predator avoidance under aquatic environments characterized by longer light wavelengths. moreover, the results provides important insights into the evolution of female preference through sensory drive, as changes in sensitivity to orange light due to the expression levels of lws opsins may affect the perception of orange spots in male guppies.
