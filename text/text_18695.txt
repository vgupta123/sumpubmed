BACKGROUND
there are at least  <dig> million clinical episodes of malaria annually with more than a million africans dying each year, most of whom are children under  <dig> years of age  <cit> . the causative agent for the most lethal form of malaria is a protozoan parasite, plasmodium falciparum, while p. vivax causes a less severe form, p. knowlesi is responsible for macaque malaria , and p. yoelii and berghei infect rodents. plasmodium parasites are frequently subject to oxidative attack, for example, in the erythrocyte from h2o <dig> release during heme metabolism and from no and reactive oxygen species  generation during the host immune response  <cit> . in addition, oxidative stress is sustained during the sexual maturation of the parasite within the anopheles mosquito midgut and salivary gland prior to transmission  <cit> . as such, plasmodium antioxidant defences are essential to its survival, and thus are expected to be targets for the effective control of the disease  <cit> .

interestingly, neither the plasmodium parasites nor the trypanosomes contain a catalase or a selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase , which are enzymes notably efficient for the detoxification of hydroperoxides  <cit> . plasmodium does however possess  <dig> superoxide dismutases,  <dig> proteins homologous to thiol-dependent peroxidases, and a glutathione-s-transferase . the gst has only weak gsh peroxidase activity, but it might contribute significantly to the antioxidant capacity of the parasite due to its high concentration  <cit> . of those homologous to the thiol-dependent peroxidases, there is the gpx-like thioredoxin peroxidase, which is a non-selenocysteine gpx known to be significantly less active than its selenium homologue  <cit> . the  <dig> remaining thiol-dependent peroxidase homologues identified in plasmodium include thioredoxin peroxiredoxin  <dig> and  <dig>  from the peroxiredoxin subfamily prx <dig>  a 1-cys peroxiredoxin  from the prx <dig> subfamily, antioxidant protein  from subfamily prx <dig>  and a very recently characterized nuclear peroxiredoxin   <cit>  . interestingly, peroxiredoxins have recently been implicated in a different role, namely as a non-transcriptional rhythmic marker, indicative of the circadian clock  <cit> . various strategies have been used to classify the members of the peroxiredoxin family including a phylogenetic tree analysis that categorizes them into  <dig> subfamilies , each of which may include the mechanistically distinct 1-cys and 2-cys peroxiredoxins  <cit> .

all peroxiredoxins contain a conserved cysteine residue at the n-terminus that is referred to as the peroxidatic cysteine . during catalysis, it is oxidized by the ros substrate  to sulfenic acid . typical 2-cys prx contain  <dig> conserved cysteines, including the cp and a c-terminal cysteine ). during catalysis, the cp sulfenic acid reacts with the cr of the adjacent monomer to form the intermolecular disulfide of the homodimer that is subsequently reduced by another  thiol. in 1-cys prx, the cp sulfenic acid is directly reduced by an unidentified redox partner.

building on the dimer formation, the 2-cys prx enzymes organize themselves into higher order oligomers, such as decamers, which have higher peroxidase activity. formation of the higher order oligiomers is dependent on the redox state of cp , as well as other factors  <cit> . both trx-px <dig> and trx-px <dig> have been identified as typical 2-cys prx enzymes; and a crystal structure of p. falciparum trx-px <dig>  has been published  <cit> . distinguishing these two plasmodium thioredoxin peroxidases is their cellular location, as trx-px <dig> is predicted to be cytosolic and trx-px <dig> has a mitochondrial targeting sequence  <cit> . both features were recently confirmed  <cit> . like the plasmodium 1-cys prx from subfamily prx <dig>  aop is also a 1-cys prx; and the p. falciparum aop structure has been solved   <cit> . aop is thought to be an apicoplast enzyme due to its n-terminal signal motif, while the other plasmodium 1-cys prx is cytosolic. both predictions were recently confirmed experimentally  <cit> . prx enzymes are highly expressed in plasmodium  and have been predicted from competitive kinetic analysis with human cells to be responsible for the reduction of 90% of mitochondrial h2o <dig> and nearly 100% of cytoplasmic h2o <dig>  <cit> .

in order to further the understanding of the molecular details of the plasmodium redox system, we solved the crystal structures of trx-px <dig> from p. vivax  in the reduced and oxidized forms, trx-px <dig> from p. yoelii  in the oxidized form, and a 1-cys prx from p. yoelii  with cp oxidized to the sulfinic acid and with glycerol bound within the active site pocket. in addition, we have structurally confirmed and characterized the pvtrx-px <dig> as a h2o2-sensitive peroxiredoxin; pytrx-px <dig> as forming an octamer ; and pyprx <dig> as a product bound complex revealing some interesting features of these enzymes.

RESULTS
expression and initial characterization of trx-px <dig> from p. falciparum, p. vivax, p. yoelii, and p. knowlesi and prx <dig> from p. yoelii
constructs of the trx-px <dig> enzymes from p. falciparum, p. vivax, p. yoelii, and p. knowlesi were expressed and purified as described previously  <cit> . pyprx <dig> was also expressed in studier auto-induction media  <cit> . all were full length constructs except pytrx-px <dig> which was also expressed for crystallization with a 6-residue truncation at the n-terminus. according to our mass spectroscopic analysis, all of our purified trx-px <dig> enzymes were disulfide-linked dimers . as verified by mass spectroscopy, each of the  <dig> purified trx-px <dig> enzymes could be completely reduced using  <dig> mm dithiothreitol .

pytrx-px1:
the calculated mw in da is determined from the amino acid sequence and includes the his6-tag incorporated into our constructs. the expected monomer mw is determined from the calculated monomer mw and subtracts the known e. coli post translational modification, namely clipping of the n-terminal met  of the his6-tag  <cit> . the expected mw of the oxidized dimer is calculated by doubling the expected mw weight of the monomer  and subtracting  <dig> h . athe mw of the purified monomeric pftrx-px- <dig> is off by  <dig> da  which may be accounted for by one of the following: addition of ethyl addition, n, n-dimethylation of arg or lys,  <dig>  bis-trp- <dig> -dione formation, or addition of formaldehyde 

by analytical gel filtration, all of the purified trx-px <dig> constructs  eluted primarily as the higher order oligomer  . oligomerization has been shown to be dependent on numerous factors including ionic strength, ph, concentration of divalent metals, and most importantly redox state  <cit> . in our gel filtration, a small amount of presumably aggregated protein was followed by the oligomeric protein around . in the case of pftrx-px <dig>  some presumably dimeric protein was also observed, which was not noticed in previous gel filtration analyses of pftrx-px <dig> by akerman and coworkers.  <cit> . these authors only observed higher order oligomers corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> kda for pftrx-px- <dig> and further detected the  <dig> quaternary form by electron microscopy.

pyprx <dig> was expressed in two ways: pyprx <dig> expressed from our typical protocol was purified in the reduced form according to mass spectroscopy  without addition of exogenous reducing agents , while pyprx <dig> expressed from studier auto-induction media was purified in the sulfinic acid form . from a calibrated gel filtration column, the enzyme eluted at  <dig> ml  which is consistent with the expected behaviour of a dimer.

crystal structures of trx-px <dig> from p. vivax and p. yoelii
the crystal structures of p. vivax trx-px <dig> were solved in both the reduced  and oxidized forms  at  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively . aside from these  <dig> structures, to date only rat and salmonella typhimurium prx <dig> subfamily structures have been solved in both fully reduced and oxidized  redox states  <cit> . in comparison to other solved structures, pvtrx-px <dig> is most similar  to pftrx-px <dig>  <cit> . it has 85% sequence identity with pftrx-px <dig> and 47% identity to its closest human orthologues. herein, the oxidized form of pytrx-px <dig> has also been solved to  <dig>  Å  .

the structures of each  contain the typical thioredoxin-fold found in known peroxiredoxins. there is a central 7-stranded β-sheet comprised of β2-β1-β5-β4-β3-β6-β <dig> with β <dig> and β <dig> running anti-parallel relative to the other strands. this β-sheet is sandwiched by α <dig> and α <dig> on one side and α <dig>  α <dig>  and α <dig> on the other side. the root mean square deviation  between pvtrx-px1_ox, and pytrx-px1_ox is  <dig>  Å when superimposing over the monomer encompassing cα's from residues  <dig> to  <dig>  the remaining residues of the c-terminus are disordered  in the pvtrx-px1_ox structure.

in pvtrx-px1_red structure, the cp residue  is located at the first turn of helix α <dig> at the end of a narrow accessible channel formed by a loop-helix motif and surrounded by  <dig> conserved residues pro <dig>  thr <dig>  and arg <dig> . the pyrrolidine ring of pro <dig> limits solvent accessibility and protects the reactive cysteinyl sulfenic acid from further oxidation during catalysis. the distance between cys <dig> and the corresponding cr thiol from its dimeric partner is  <dig>  Å in the reduced form. in both the oxidized structures of pvtrx-px1_ox and pytrx-px1_ox, the α <dig> helix is locally unfolded  around the cp, such that the α <dig> helix begins after the cp with ser <dig>  or ser <dig> . some conserved residues that form the active site in the reduced structure are in the same positions and orientations in both the oxidized structures . the cp has rotated to the surface as part of a highly exposed loop; and sp  is engaged in a disulfide bond with sr  of the enzyme's dimeric partner forming a domain swapped homodimer.

pvtrx-px <dig> and pytrx-px <dig> are h2o2-sensitive peroxiredoxins
the  <dig> sequence motifs that define the h2o2-sensitive peroxiredoxins include:  the conserved loop-helix from pro <dig> to glu <dig> surrounding the cp;  a  <dig> helix-loop from pro <dig> to ile98; and  the  <dig> c-terminal residues from gly <dig> including cr and conserved bulky residues  <cit> . the loop-helix is completely conserved among human, rat, and plasmodium peroxiredoxins. however, the plasmodium enzymes are a slight variation of  <dig> helix-loop and c-terminal tail motifs with sequences including 93ggig <dig> and 191yl <dig>  respectively, instead of the typical gglg and yf . upon addition of  <dig> μm to  <dig> mm h2o <dig> to reduced  pftrx-px <dig>  pvtrx-px <dig>  pktrx-px <dig>  or pytrx-px <dig> enzymes, additions of  <dig> and  <dig> oxygen atoms were observed by mass spectroscopy, confirming that these enzymes are h2o2-sensitive. structurally, the first loop-helix and the c-terminal arm of p. falciparum were predicted by modelling to undergo the same structural rearrangement during catalysis as the mammalian peroxiredoxins  <cit> . figure 3b, 3c illustrate the structural changes that pvtrx-px <dig> does indeed undergo during catalysis further supporting its characterization as a h2o2-sensitive peroxiredoxin. although predicted by kawazu  <cit> , to be fluid  from pro <dig> immediately following cp, the c-terminal tail is an ordered loop from pro <dig> to gly <dig> in the pvtrx-px1_ox structure. the pytrx-px1_ox structure also shows a similar arrangement of conserved residues, a  <dig> helix-loop motif at 90plsqggigni <dig>  and a c-terminal tail bearing a 191yl <dig> motif , so it is also expected to be a h2o2-sensitive peroxiredoxin . the conserved 191yl <dig> motif that is located on the α-helix close to the surface stabilizes the full-folded conformation. this motif therefore slows the resolution reaction and allows overoxidation by reaction with a second equivalent of peroxide. in contrast robust peroxiredoxins do not have residues protecting the cp and are quickly oxidized to the disulfide  <cit> .

disulfide bonds in the pvtrx-px1_ox and pytrx-px1_ox structures
upon examination of each dimer of pvtrx-px1_ox decamer  <dig> oligomer) , only  <dig> of a possible  <dig> disulfide bonds are clearly defined in the crystal structure. there is inadequate density to define the c-terminal tail from around the cr for the remaining residues, so that for several of the monomers only the side chain of cp but not that of cr is visible. in the case of the pytrx-px1_ox octamer  <dig> oligomer)   the cys-sp to cys-sr distances measure ~ <dig> Å . there are no reports indicating that disulfide bonds are labile under the conditions used in our pytrx-px <dig> experiments. as expected, the c-terminal tails of pvtrx-px <dig> and pytrx-px <dig> have higher b-factors than the other parts of the molecule, indicative of a more fluid region and also of the apparent absence of detectable disulfide bonds in portions of the pvtrx-px <dig> structure and the distortion of the disulfide bond length in the pytrx-px <dig> structure. in previously published crystal structures of oxidized 2-cys prx, the cys-sp to cys-sr distance is also longer than expected for a disulfide bond . for example in the structure of a 2-cys prx from helicobacter pylori  , the cys-sp to cys-sr distances measurements range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å and in a p. falciparum 2-cys prx   one of the disulfides is shown in two different orientations  indicative of the structural flexibility of these structures, while the other measures at  <dig>  Å. our analysis using mass spectroscopy  and the overall structural configurations  both support pvtrx-px1_ox and pytrx-px1_ox being in the oxidized form making these long cys-sp to cys-sr distances not easily accounted for, yet prevalent in the prx <dig> subfamily.

oligomeric organization of pvtrx-px <dig> and pytrx-px1
oligomeric peroxiredoxins are formed via at least  <dig> types of interactions:  b-type interactions where edge to edge associations of β <dig> strands of the central sheet meet to extend it into a 14-stranded β-sheet; and  a-type where the interface is a tip to tip association centred on helices α <dig> and α <dig> packing against helices α <dig> and α <dig> of the other chain  <cit> . the dimer interface of the pvtrx-px1_ox and pytrx-px1_ox  is termed the b-type interaction face. accordingly, the same dimeric unit is expected in the reduced structures. these dimers then associate via a-type interactions to form the higher order oligomers, which are typically decameric and dodecameric. pvtrx-px1_ox and pvtrx-px1_red arrange in a decameric fashion , which from a survey of peroxiredoxin structures deposited to the pdb is the most common oligomerization. according to our results , the toroid pytrx-px <dig> structure is unique in that it is octameric . pvtrx-px1_ox and pvtrx-px1_red decamers have internal diameters of ~ <dig> Å, while pytrx-px1_ox octameric diameter is correspondingly smaller at ~ <dig> Å. li et al. reportedly solved the structure of another octameric peroxiredoxin , but this has been disputed as simply a crystallographic artifact, as predominately dimers were observed in gel filtration and the octameric interface is not extensive and does not involve the typical interfaces  <cit> . it could be argued that the octameric arrangement of pytrx-px <dig> is a result of the crystal packing of pytrx-px1_ox dimers; however, no dimers were observed in the gel filtration of the pytrx-px1_ox sample which was done at a high μm concentration comparable to crystallization experiments. interestingly, there is a hydrogen bonding interaction in the pytrx-px <dig> structure between distant monomers and more specifically between adjacent dimers, where the c-terminal tail of one monomer crosses its dimeric partner to hydrogen bond to next monomer. contributing to the stability of the octamer, the side chain of lys <dig> is within hydrogen bonding distance  of the backbone carbonyl of lys <dig> . indeed, there are interactions between each of the pairs a-c, b-d, c-e, d-f, e-g, f-h, g-a, and h-b, as one would expect from symmetry . although these  <dig> residues are conserved in pvtrx-px <dig>  there is no similar interaction in the pvtrx-px1_ox or pvtrx-px1_red structures . there is 83% sequence identity between the p. yoelii and p. vivax trx-px <dig> enzymes, so the differences in oligomeric state were not predictable. previous reports have identified alterations of the b-type interface as conferring the different orders of oligomeric state, while the a-type interface remains constant  <cit> . an alignment of the cα's of a monomer from the decameric pvtrx-px1_ox with a monomer from octameric pytrx-px1_ox  is shown in figure 4e, f to illustrate the overlap of each accompanying monomer in the a-type interface and b-type interface, respectively. in figure 4e, the corresponding a-type interface dimer is shown for the octamer and decamer which visually appears to preserve the overlap for their respective dimeric partners. indeed, a structural alignment of the a-type dimers between the octamer and decamer gives a rmsd of  <dig>  Å. figure 4f shows the same monomers aligned, but in this case, their respective b-type interface with the dimeric partner from the opposite side shown. here, one can see that the overlap is poor which is also reflected as a much larger rmsd of  <dig>  Å for the alignment of octameric and decameric b-type dimeric partners. in order to more directly compare the interfaces, each monomer is simplified to the  <dig> cα's of conserved leucine residues at its core, for example, leu  <dig> and leu <dig> from pvtrx-px1and corresponding leu <dig> and leu <dig> from pytrx-px <dig> . an analysis of the changes between the pytrx-px <dig> octamer and the pvtrx-px <dig> decamer was undertaken using these conserved core residues as a representation of each monomer. indeed, the model is validated, as the distance between the selected leucine residues  is conserved throughout each of the structures and is similar between the two structures . the orientation  and distance between the dimers within the oligomer is also conserved between the pytrx-px <dig> octamer and pvtrx-px <dig> decamer . on the other hand, the orientation  and distance between the monomers of the dimer  is dramatically different between the octamer and decamer. the observation that the different oligomerization is attributable to the interface within the dimer suggests that the oligomerization is not an artifact of crystallization and that the dimer itself is unique at least in terms of its b-type interface.

analysis of the structures of pytrx-px <dig> and pvtrx-px <dig> identifies several key points of difference between the structures that may account for difference in oligomerization. first of all, the presence of a hydrogen bond between the dimers of pytrx-px <dig>  was already discussed . secondly, the c-terminal tails have different orientations, such that they are binding at different positions on the surface of their respective dimeric partners . the tails are bound by an intermolecular disulfide between cp and cr, as well as a series of hydrophobic interactions. the different binding orientations are linked to the orientation of the side chain of a conserved arginine  . in the case of pvtrx-px <dig>  the arginine is buried and the c-terminal tail adopts the typical binding pattern on the surface of its respective dimeric partner . as opposed to pytrx-px <dig> where the equivalent arginine side chain is at the surface of the protein obstructing the typical pathway, such that the c-terminal tail adopts a different position at the surface of its partner . using the ncbi molecular modeling database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/mmdb/mmdb.shtml, a search was performed to identify 3d structures to similar pytrx-px <dig>  a manual inspection of each the 2-cys peroxiredoxins of the  <dig> low redundancy hits  showed no similarity in orientation to the pytrx-px <dig> c-terminal tail, as expected as no other toroid octameric peroxiredoxins are known to date. a second point of differentiation between the two structures is a loop with the conserved sequence 142nnlagrs <dig> ) that connects α <dig> and β <dig>  and contains the afore mentioned buried/surface arg. the loops from each structure adopt different conformations that put arg <dig> at the surface for pytrx-px <dig> and the corresponding arg <dig> buried for pvtrx-px <dig>  although the pvtrx-px <dig> structure is from a full-length construct, only a structure with an n-terminal truncation of  <dig> residues crystallized sufficiently well for data collection in the case pytrx-px <dig>  although both constructs bear a n-terminal his6-tag, the tag could only be cleaved from the pvtrx-px <dig> construct. even after several days at room temperature , the his6-tag remained intact on pytrx-px <dig>  although the tag is partially visible in pytrx_px <dig> case, it is not close enough to the conserved loop in both cases to affect its orientation. further studies will determine what roles the structural features identified herein grs-loop, and the c-terminal tail) play in the stoichiometry of oligomerization of these trx-px <dig> enzymes.

crystal structure of pyprx <dig> with product bound
the pyprx6-so2h crystal structure has been solved at  <dig>  Å . it is 47% identical to its closest human orthologue and shares 76% sequence identity with its p. falciparum orthologue. the closest available structure by sequence  is arenicola marina peroxiredoxin  <dig> which was further identified as a 2-cys prx  <cit> , but it also shares 47% sequence identity with a solved structure for a human 1-cys prx  <cit> . overall, the human  and p. yoelii structures are very similar with a core thioredoxin-fold and a c-terminal domain connected by both an extended helix α <dig> and a loop. the core rmsd is  <dig> a for  <dig> aligned residues in both structures. the c-terminal domain of pyprx <dig> that comprised of  <dig> β-strands and a α-helix is larger than the c-terminal domain from the prx <dig> subfamily . this domain from each monomer extends over the other forming a domain swapped dimer.

the active site cp  is located at the bottom of a narrow pocket  at the end of helix α <dig>  there are  <dig> additional densities in each of the  <dig> active site pockets of the asymmetric unit  which are best filled by a glycerol molecule  and fitting the cp residues to their sulfinic acid derivatives . previously, the cp has been structurally characterized in the whole range of oxidation states   <cit> ; and our data agrees with those sulfinic acid structures previously studied. as well, nearly  <dig> peroxiredoxin structures have either substrate or what has been termed substrate analogue bound in their active site pockets, including h2o <dig>  benzoate, acetate, dithiothreitol , ethylene glycol, glycerol, sulfate, citrate, and formate  <cit> .

in order to understand the reaction mechanism, our focus is on the comparison of structures with substrate  or glycerol bound. the binding of h2o <dig> to aeropyrum pernix tpx  has been structural characterized   <cit> . further work on these structures and comparisons to other ligand bound peroxiredoxin structures previously showed that oxygen atoms of the ligands overlap with the proximal  oxygen atom  and/or the distal oxygen atom  of bound h2o <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the glycerol molecule found in these structures can adopt all three possibilities:  in one monomer of aptrx  it is found with a single oxygen atom overlapping oa ;  in another monomer of aptrx , it is found to overlap with both oa and ob ; and  reported for the first time, in our structure of pyprx <dig>  the glycerol is observed to overlay with only ob . previously, only  <dig> anionic ligands  were observed to occupy ob alone   <cit> . despite variations in the backbone orientation of the glycerol in our structure , the binding of all  <dig> glycerol molecules shows that each binds with the terminal hydroxyl in a similar position overlapping with ob site . oxygen atoms at position oa are postulated to be a mimetic for the substrate bound in a michaelis complex ready for attack by the nucleophilic cp, while oxygen atoms at position ob are indicative of the leaving group   <cit> . as such, it can be suggested that the glycerol positioned with its terminal hydroxyl at ob is in a product bound configuration. although there is variability in the binding of the remainder of the glycerol molecule, the alkyl group is always directed away from the active site pocket and the oxygen of the leaving group is in close proximity to a conserved threonine . this arrangement suggests that it may be the proton donor, although others have suggested that this threonine functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor as it deprotonates the incoming substrate for attack by the cp thiolate and that bulk solvent is responsible for the protonation of the leaving group  <cit> . therefore, the active site pocket is adapted to accommodate different substrates , which is exemplified through the structural flexibility exhibited in the product bound glycerol shown herein. as well, the ob position appears to be designated for the oxygen of the leaving group and is well positioned for protonation by a conserved threonine.

the conserved residues of the cp loop comprised of 40pxxxxtxxcp <dig> and conserved arg <dig>  are implicated in catalysis . for the conserved arginine in both pyprx <dig>  and aptrx•h2o <dig> structures, it adopts position i, typical of prx <dig>  which bears a conserved arginine  and glutamate   and supports the positioning by a hydrogen bonding network, as previously described  <cit> . the active site geometry is fully folded  and is virtually identical to that of the aptrx•h2o <dig>  as was recently described, the nucleophilic cp  is expected to act as a thiolate and attack the substrate in an sn <dig> fashion  <cit> . these hydrogen bonds, as well as those secondary ones from the backbone carbonyls and the glutamic acid/second conserved arginine, surrounding the cp are preserved between the aptrx x•h2o <dig> and the pyprx6•glycerol structures suggesting that the sulfinic acid form may be activated, and thus sufficiently nucleophilic  within the active site to undergo a further reaction with substrate. this would result in a subsequent oxidation of the active site to the sulfonic acid. indeed, this form of the cp has been structural characterized in other cases . the conserved proline serves as a barrier to solvent, while the main chain of the cp loop provides hydrogen bonds to the cp and the conserved threonine. although at a reduced efficiency owing to the relative activity of an oxidized thiol relative to a thiolate, the preservation of the hydrogen bonding network about the active site cysteine, indicates that sequential h2o <dig> reductions are possible.

discussion
plasmodium lacks the two major antioxidant enzymes of eukaryotic cells, namely glutathione peroxidase and catalase  <cit> . as such, the parasite is likely to rely on the peroxiredoxin family to control peroxide production  during critical stages of its lifecycle, for example during erythrocyte invasion when heme metabolism and immune response pathways ensue. during the trophozoite stage , prx enzymes accounts for  <dig> % of the total expressed protein  <cit> . one recent study suggests that pfnprx, the p. falciparium nuclear peroxiredoxin might be essential in the erthyrocyte stage, as neither p. falciparum or p. berghei knock-out lines could be generated despite several attempts and success with generating tagged nprx-gfp fusion cell lines  <cit> . analysis of the growth of a p. berghei trx-px <dig> knockout also suggests that trx-px <dig> is not essential for growth, but p. falciparum and p. bergei show differences in their lifecycles  <cit> . there is a possibility that trx-px <dig> is essential during the asexual growth of p. falciparum  <cit> . expression of pf1-cys prx is elevated during the trophozoite and early schizont stages  suggesting that this subfamily detoxifies ros, like those released during heme metabolism  <cit> . despite the important roles of peroxiredoxins, whether inhibitors targeting plasmodium peroxiredoxins will lead to parasite death remains to be determined.

structural characterization of the 2-cys prx enzymes has shown that the c-terminal tail  is essential for stabilizing the octameric/decameric arrangement of peroxiredoxins. when trx-px <dig>  is oxidized to the disulfide form, the cr loop is unfolded; and structural support of the octamer/decamer/dodecamer interfaces are weakened giving rise to dimer formation . when the cr loop is folded as in the reduced form, the higher order oligomer is favoured because of increased stabilization for the b-type interface which supports oligomerization. the dramatic rearrangement of the c-terminal tail and ensuing changes in stability are clearly demonstrated in our structures from pytrx-px <dig> and pvtrx-px <dig> . however, the high concentrations of protein used in crystallizing the enzyme  may account for the trapping of the disulfide forms of these peroxiredoxins in their predicted unfavoured octameric/decameric/dodecameric forms. factors associated with the oligomeric forms primarily include reduction of the active site disulfide, but also, high or low ionic strength, low ph, high magnesium or calcium concentrations, and overoxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine   <cit> . at physiologically relevant concentrations, peroxiredoxins can be expected to exist as dimers awaiting reduction; and upon reduction, the catalytic cycle is complete and the reduced peroxiredoxin oligomerizes  <cit> . with data from the novel octameric configuration of pytrx-prx <dig> studied herein, other specific structural features affecting oligomerization are considered. the molecular basis for octamer formation relies on the hydrogen bond between the dimers which is facilitated by the positioning of the c-terminal tail which in turn rests on interplay between the surface/buried arginine of the nnlagrs-loop and possibly the n-terminal tail. in vivo work directed at the further characterization of the different sizes and configurations of the oligomers will be necessary to fully understand the biological implications.

aside from being antioxidant proteins, 2-cys prx  has also been implicated in h2o2-mediated signal transduction. eukaryotic 2-cys prx enzymes are sensitive to oxidative inactivation, while their bacterial orthologues are robust with respect to overoxidation  <cit> . the plasmodium 2-cys prx enzymes accordingly have the  <dig> sequence motifs indicative of the h2o2-sensitive peroxiredoxins, and as shown herein are structurally identical with respect to sensitivity to h2o <dig> to known h2o2-sensitive 2-cys prx enzymes, thus allowing low resting levels of h2o <dig>  while permitting higher levels during signal transduction.

the pyprx <dig> structure presented herein has greatly enhanced our understanding of the chemistry of the peroxiredoxins. with a product bound configuration, the residues supporting the leaving group are further understood. there is flexibility for the alkyl chain, but the ob position is indeed designated for the oxygen of the leaving group. as well, the retention of hydrogen bonds about the active site thiol  indicates that it is poised for further reaction, albeit at a reduced efficiency owing to the reduced activity of an oxidized thiol relative to a thiolate.

CONCLUSIONS
our structural data and mass spectroscopy confirms that pvtrx-px <dig> is h2o2-sensitive peroxiredoxin. the characterization of the oligomerization of pytrx-px <dig> has identified structural features supporting its novel octameric oligomerization. previously unreported abnormalities of the disulfide bond measurements in some of the prx crystal structures are brought to the forefront. finally, a crystal structure with an alcohol bound and the cp oxidized gives a view to the product bound complex providing insight into leaving group and the susceptibility of some peroxiredoxins to overoxidation. these results enhance our understanding of the structural variations of the peroxiredoxin oligomers and the nature of the catalysis by these remarkable enzymes. further work will lend insight into the biological implications of the oligomerization and how to exploit the active site features in drug discovery programs.
