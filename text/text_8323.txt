BACKGROUND
in the higher plants, only a small percentage of the genome is required for maintenance of life  <cit> , and transposable elements and the sequences derived from them are scattered in the other highly repetitive dna regions  <cit> . the transposable elements are classified into the class i transposable elements , which use a transcript as a template and transfer replicatively, and class ii transposable elements , which transfer dna by the cut-and-paste mechanism. it is believed that class i long terminal repeat  retrotransposons and class ii miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  are major components of the plant genome  <cit> . such transfer factors can be used as the source of mutations for dna marker development or gene functional analysis; the transposable elements with a high number of copies can become the entry points for pcr during dna marker development, and the transposable elements that cause gene disruption enable tagging of genes and contribute to functional genome research  <cit> . however, the sequences of regions of repetitive dna other than the known transposable elements  <cit>  are still undetermined, while in the region of repetitive dna regarded as junk dna, it has been found that the rna genes that perform epigenetic regulation of gene expression are also scattered  <cit> . investigation of the unknown factors in repetitive dna regions is also important as a key to understanding the mechanisms of genome control and phenotypic expression.

the first authors recently reported a new transposon-like gene, named revolver, in triticeae  <cit> . a part of the reiterated sequence  specific to the rye genome was cloned by the genome subtraction technique, which deducts the sequence in common with bread wheat from the rye genome  <cit> . in order to determine the entire structure of this reiterated sequence, the Î» fixii genomic library of the rye-inbred line was screened by using  <dig> bp of the repetitive clone as a probe, and the base sequence of a region of about  <dig>  kb was decoded in three lambda clones. as a result, the insertion-type consensus sequence  with a full-length sequence of  <dig>  bp sandwiched between  <dig> bp of specific terminal inverted repeat  sequence was determined and shown to be similar to the class ii transposable elements  <cit> . revolver contains one gene that codes for an open reading frame  of a deduced  <dig> amino acid residue that is actively transcribed into mrna. the sequence of the  <dig> bp inverted repeat sequence at both ends is different from that of the known transposons represented by hat, cacta, and mutator, and  <dig> bp of the tandemly repeated sequence is also repeated in the subterminal region.

in a genomic dna clones of rye that show homology to revolver, great structural variation in the region ranging from the first exon to the first intron had arisen and four sequences thought to be nonautonomous factors for revolver were found. revolver produces  <dig>  kb of mrna and is conserved in triticeae. a putative tata box is located at base  <dig>  with a cap site at base  <dig> and a possible polyadenylation signal aataaa at base  <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, the full length of the nonautonomic factor is  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the nonautonomic factor has a 37-149-bp homologous region upstream from the transcription start site containing a tir at the 5' end and a 1294-2112-bp region covering from around the second exon to the 3' end on the 3' side. a region of 549- <dig> bps located between them  is destroyed. in rye and barley, the nonautonomic factors sharing each end with revolver are considered to exist within it  <cit> .

the number of copies in triticeae was computed by southern blot analysis and slot blotting techniques by using cdna of revolver as the probe. consequently, extremely high numbers of revolver  have been shown to exist in dasypyrum villosum and secale sp., as well as in diploid species such as triticum monococcum, which is the ancestor of bread wheat and tetraploid species such as emmer wheat, with around  <dig>  copies. however, the number of copies is extremely low in hexaploid bread wheat. there has been a large quantitative change during the evolution of triticeae resulting in amplification of revolver in some species and its disappearance in bread wheat  <cit> . the considerable quantitative variability of revolver among the wheat-related species strongly indicates its propagation or differential loss, activity, and diversity in recent evolutionary times.

in this paper, the structural divergence of revolver in genomic dna and rna was analyzed, and length variants of the revolver family were used as chromosome tags to search the publicly disclosed expressed sequence tag  database of the  <dig>  triticeae est sequences for revolver homologues. moreover, we examined the quantitative variations of revolver in  <dig> t. dicoccoides accessions  <cit>  representing  <dig> populations collected from various locations in israel, which encompass a wide range of ecologic conditions of soil, temperature, altitude, and water availability, to determine the effects of ecologic stress on quantitative variation.

RESULTS
structural diversity of revolver mrna
revolver, encompassing a  <dig>  bp sequence, has  <dig> bp of tir sequences and contains a transcriptionally-active gene, consisting of three exons  and two introns  , and encodes a dna-binding-like protein  <cit> . fifty cdna clones of the revolver family were obtained from self-fertile rye , and a structural analysis was performed. the total lengths of typical revolver cdnas were  <dig> to  <dig> bp in  <dig> clones out of  <dig> cdnas, and they were classified into three subfamilies  in which the regions of the second and third exons were almost identical, while the region of the first exon exhibited a low homology of 60% among the subfamilies because of duplication or deletion . the homologies in the subfamilies were 89% , 97% , and 93% , and the homologies between the subfamilies were 75% for subfamily i and subfamily iii, 80% for subfamily i and subfamily iii, and 76% for subfamily i and subfamily iii. comparing sequences between the exons, the second exon  and the third exon  exhibited high homologies of  <dig> to 95% between the different subfamilies. in contrast, the first exon exhibited high homology within the subfamilies ; but the homologies between subfamilies were low . in the first exon, partial deletions and mutations of different lengths were found in the base sequences of the three classes. thus, the classification of the cdna corresponds to the structural divergence of the first exon. because repetitive sequence units composed of  <dig> to  <dig> bp are present in the same direction in the first exon, a nonhomologous recombination between alleles might have caused various structural mutations.

moreover, cdnas exhibiting completely different structures at the first exon were found in  <dig> cdna clones from self-fertile rye . among them, five cdnas had a total length of  <dig>  bp and contained the second intron  and the third exon  of revolver, but at the 5' terminus, they had an  <dig> bp sequence that was not observed in revolver. on the other hand, four cdna clones had a total length of  <dig> bp and lacked the second intron compared to the cdna clones of  <dig>  bp described above. meanwhile, another cdna clone  had the second exon  and the third exon  of revolver, but the region corresponding to the first exon was extremely long and had no homology with the other cdna clones. as stated above, the members of the revolver family, having a common structure downstream of the second intron, may easily undergo various structural changes at the 5' first exon and then become divergent and show different lengths. such structural diversities were found in the first exon of the revolver genes that were obtained from the self-fertile pure rye strains, and these structural diversities may be useful for development of dna markers in the rye genome.

furthermore, revolver cdnas were recovered from s. silvestre, d. villosum, t. monococcum, and aegilops tauschii after isolation by rt-pcr with 22-mer primers used at both ends. the majority belonged to subfamilies i  or ii  of s. cereale, indicating that two major subfamilies were conserved within the triticum species. among the revolver mrnas, subfamily i contained a single orf encoding  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> , which was conserved in the triticum species with 98% homology. the revolver orf was integrated into the pet- <dig> vector, and the encoded protein fused with thioredoxin was produced in escherichia coli . the molecular weight of the fused protein was about  <dig> , and that after treatment with factor xa was about  <dig>  . the protein structure encoded by revolver was predicted by the protein folding recognition program robetta. as shown in figure 2b, the revolver orf includes the c2rf <dig> motif of a kinase domain.

expressed sequence tag homologues of revolver
in this study, we searched the publicly disclosed est database for revolver homologues. of the  <dig>  triticeae est clones in genbank having mainly t. aestivum as their source,  <dig> clones showed partial homology with revolver  . these revolver homologues were about 360- <dig> bp in length. only two clones, which were from t. aestivum  and h. vulgare , showed similarity with revolver cdna across its entire length . sequences downstream of exon  <dig> were conserved  in other est clones , although they had either low homology in the 5' regions containing exon  <dig> , or were missing in the upstream sequence. s. cereale, einkorn wheats, and ae. tauschii, all of which showed high levels of revolver transcription by northern blotting, have cloned cdna from the revolver orf coding for the  <dig> amino acids  together with  <dig> cdnas differing in exon  <dig> sequences . the 615-bp est from t. aestivum, which had the highest sequence similarity to revolver, was close to class ii ; however, the exon  <dig> region was only 60% homologous. other est clones containing the exon  <dig> region matched none of the three classes and were very different from each other . revolver-like est clones from t. aestivum were classified into at least  <dig> types on the basis of mutations in the exon  <dig> region, and these est clones exhibited large genetic variation . exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> regions showed three major clusters according to wheat, rye and barley species . thus, revolver-like transcripts do exist in t. aestivum, although their proportion among total est clones is extremely small, and given that they include variants with large mutations, no true revolver genes were present. we hypothesize that revolver was lost in t. aestivum because it lost its ability to be reinserted. on the other hand, no revolver homologues were found in the oryzeae est database. in addition, revolver was not detected in the rice genome by southern blot analysis.

development of chromosomal markers with revolver
a typical genomic clone of revolver  was located in this study on the rye 7r chromosome because  <dig> bp of dna was amplified only from the rye 7r chromosome addition line by pcr using the 5'-flanking region of revolver- <dig>  5'-gcctttcggccttcctctcaggcgg-3', and its internal sequence of 5'-gtacttggcatcggtagatgttcgg-3', as the primers. pcr was performed then with the 3'-flanking region derived from the typical genomic clone of revolver- <dig> as a single primer, and  <dig> dna fragments  were amplified from the rye genome, but nothing was amplified from the wheat genome . furthermore, when pcr was performed with the same primer and genomic dna from rye chromosome addition lines as a template, dna fragments of  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb were amplified from the 1r, 5r, and 6r chromosome addition lines, respectively . pcr amplification with this single primer identified rye chromosomes 1r and 5r simultaneously. each dna fragment derived from the chromosome addition lines and four types of dnas amplified from the rye genome were sequenced ; and the variants were shown to have the downstream region of the second intron, but they had structural modifications at the 5' first exon region as in the cdnas . such a difference in length in revolver allows the development of rye chromosome markers.

revolver- <dig>  <cit>  comprises a total length of  <dig>  bp, and at the 3' end it has a region of  <dig>  bp from the middle of the first intron of revolver through the third exon and reaches the 3'-terminal region . in this study, revolver- <dig> was shown to be localized on the 6r chromosome because it was amplified with the 3'-flanking region primer of revolver- <dig> only from the rye 6r chromosome addition line. furthermore, revolver- <dig> located on the rye 1r chromosome had a total length of  <dig>  bp, while at the 3' side it had a region of  <dig>  bp extending from immediately before the second exon to the 3' terminus of revolver . at its 5' side, the region homologous to revolver is limited to only  <dig> bp at the terminus; but a region of about  <dig> bp is homologous to revolver- <dig>  <cit> , which consists of  <dig>  bp, and at the 3' end it has a region of  <dig>  bp ranging from immediately before the second exon to the 3' terminus of revolver . finally, revolver- <dig> located on the rye 5r chromosome  had a total length of  <dig>  bp, and at the 3' side, it had a region of  <dig>  bp from the middle of the second intron to the 3' terminus of revolver. however, at the 5' side, there was no region homologous to revolver, and the  <dig> bp sequence at the 5' terminus was homologous to revolver- <dig> and revolver- <dig> .

as mentioned above, the members of the revolver family showed considerable length variation which was attributed to structural changes in the first exon. such a divergence in length is also found in some transposons, the cacta family  <cit> , the mutator family  <cit> , and the mite family  <cit> , but no homology was detected between revolver and any of these. if the revolver family is a transposable element, these variants are assumed to be nonautonomous elements. revolver showed a variability that was considerably larger than the others. with pcr primers comprising the sequences flanking the length variants of revolver scattered in the genome, the chromosome on which each revolver is located can be determined or tagged, and such pcr primers can be utilized for detection and identification of the chromosomes.

quantitative variation of revolver in wild emmer wheat of israel
among the triticum species, revolver shows the highest copy number  in s. cereale, and the lowest copy number  in t. aestivum  <cit> . in this study, the copy numbers of revolver in wild emmer wheat were estimated by slot blot analysis. the revolver cdna subfamily i , which is conserved in triticum species, was used as a probe. wild emmer wheat, triticum dicoccoides , is a tetraploid progenitor from which modern tetraploid and hexaploid cultivated wheat is derived. t. dicoccoides deserves to be considered as a potential genetic resource for cereal improvement because wild emmer harbors rich genetic diversity for multiple disease resistances, agronomic traits of economic significance, and environmental adaptations  <cit> . the center of distribution and genetic diversity of t. dicoccoides is found in the catchment area of the upper jordan valley in israel and its vicinity  <cit> . we examined the copy number of revolver in wild emmer wheat t. dicoccoides in  <dig> populations , representing a wide range of ecologic conditions of soil, temperature, and water availability in israel .

all populations were rich in copy number . most populations had a large variance in copy number from around  <dig>  to  <dig> , despite the predominantly self-fertilizing nature of this species. the populations in the catchment area of yehudiyya, gamla, tabigha, and rosh-pinna, where semi-humid and warm climatic conditions prevail, showed high copy numbers, which were almost over  <dig>  per haploid genome and included several genotypes having around  <dig>  copies . several populations had higher numbers than  <dig> : yehudiyya shade or sun, amirim, bet oren, bat shelomo, gamla, giv'at koah, and j'aba. in the marginal mesic areas of amirim, bet oren, bat shelomo, and giv'at koah, the copy numbers were very stable: between  <dig>  and  <dig> . in contrast, the populations of the marginal steppic areas, such as, mt. gerizim, kokhav-hashahar, and gitit, included several genotypes with low copy numbers less than  <dig>  . this pattern suggests that high revolver copy numbers in northern wild emmer populations appear to be associated with biotic stresses, e.g., pathogens and population densities.

the copy numbers in the populations of yehudiyya, ammiad, and tabigha showed a broad range  . some populations displayed gradual variations from low to high . about half of the populations had polymodal distribution. some populations were extremely bimodal: gamla  and gitit  . the different modes of distributions among the populations suggest differences in revolver's mobility in each population. in barley, the selective pressures under hot, dry desert conditions significantly correlate with increasing copy numbers of retrotransposon bare- <dig>  <cit>  and microsatellite sequences  <cit> . revolver showed a variance considerably larger than bare- <dig>  the propagation activity of revolver also might be responsive to both regional and local environmental conditions and its extensive quantitative diversity in the single species t. dicoccoides as well as among its local populations at microsites, such as, yehudiyya and tabigha, suggest the recent mobilization of revolver by ecological stresses.

our results show that  <dig>  or more copies of revolver exist in the native line from the area that has much precipitation and an average yearly temperature around 20Â°c; and there was a line that contained as many as  <dig>  copies, as does rye wheat. on the other hand, only a few hundred copies existed in the large majority of the lines in the area where the hot-dry monsoon occurred frequently  and the area where the number of sultry nights reached  <dig> days per year. the remarkable quantitative differences in revolver within the same species growing in different ecosystems illustrate a strong amplification activity within the last  <dig>  years.

CONCLUSIONS
transposon-like factor revolver , which is  <dig> bp in length and includes a 20-bp tir on either end, is dispersed within the genomes of triticum species. revolver contains an orf coding for an amino acid sequence of  <dig> residues that is conserved among triticum species. in s. cereale, a  <dig> -kb mrna is actively transcribed from this orf. southern blot analysis revealed multiple copies of revolver within secale and dasypyrum species, as well as some copies in diploid species, such as, einkorn wheat and aegilops tauschii, and in tetraploid species, such as, triticum durum. in contrast, copies were not found in the hexaploid species t. aestivum, in which transcribed products were also undetected by northern blot analysis. through evolution, revolver has been amplified in several triticum species while being lost in others. it is therefore a useful gene for the development of dna markers for triticeae-related species and for use in t. aestivum breeding.

the novel high-copy revolver family is transcriptionally active in rye. some of the transposon-like elements exist in high copy numbers in the genomes of most eukaryotes, but the great majority of them are inactive, and only a small portion of them retain the ability to transpose  <cit> . very few transposons have been shown to be transcriptionally active. a copia-like retroelement bare- <dig> dispersed in 10% of the barley genome  <cit>  is transcribed in somatic tissues  <cit> . some ltr retrotransposons such as tobacco tnt <dig>  tto <dig>  and oare- <dig> that are largely inactive, can be transcriptionally activated under conditions of biotic and abiotic stress, including wounding, oxidative stress, and pathogen infection  <cit> . after stress-induced transcription, the rice ltr retrotransposon tos <dig> increased in genomic copy number  <cit> . in maize, a survey of more than  <dig> Ã  <dig> ests identified only  <dig> retrotransposon cdnas, supporting the notion that most retrotransposons are inactive  <cit> . furthermore, most of these maize sequences are derived from the low-to-middle repetitive ltr retrotransposons and not from the very high copy-number elements that have been responsible for doubling the size of the maize genome in the past 5- <dig> million years. in humans, only 30- <dig> l <dig> elements out of  <dig> Ã  <dig> comprising 45% of the genome are thought to be active  <cit> . in general, high-copy retrotransposons show low-level activity except for bare- <dig>  like bare- <dig>  highly repetitive revolver is transcribed.

a transcriptionally active revolver gene is well conserved among the triticeae members. the methylated and heterochromatic state of most transposons can cause them to change sequences more rapidly than genes  <cit> . for example, regulation at any stage of the replication cycle for retrotransposons  can limit transposition. furthermore, the paucity of maize retrotransposon-derived ests indicates that some epigenetic mechanisms might have been repressing the transcription of a large fraction in the genome  <cit> . in contrast to these silenced retrotransposons, revolver is transcriptionally active  and might have retained transcriptional activity during the long evolution of triticeae. the predicted protein encoded by revolver subfamily i includes a c2rf <dig> motif of a kinase domain and may serve as a transcription factor among this family. the considerable variation in revolver copy numbers among t. dicoccoides indicates their propagation activity during the last  <dig>  years of t. dicoccoides evolution. the name of the novel transposon-like gene revolver means a dynamic factor in constructing genomes through evolution of the triticeae, associated with ecological stresses, and presumably navigated adaptively by natural selection.
