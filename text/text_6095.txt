BACKGROUND
amino acids are important organic substances that serve as an indispensable source of organic nitrogen for growth and development, playing vital roles in the metabolism, structure and biosynthesis of various compounds in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . in plants, amino acids are important components of nucleotides, chlorophyll, phytohormones and secondary metabolites  <cit> . amino acids are transported between different organs through both xylem and phloem, requiring the activity of amino acid transporters  in the plasma membrane  <cit> . the first plant amino acid transporter was found in arabidopsis 23 years ago, namely ataap1/nat <dig>  <cit> . amino acid/auxin permease  proteins are found in almost all eukaryotic organisms, belonging to the aat family  <cit> . these proteins contribute to the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses and long distance amino acid transport, and they mediate the transport of amino acids across the cellular membrane . in addition, previous reports showed that some members of amino acid transporters were located within the tonoplast, which were devoted to transport amino acids between vacuole and cytoplasm, and regulated the storage of amino acids in vacuole .

to date, the aaap family is one of the largest families of aats  <cit> , comprising eight subfamilies, namely prots  <cit> , gats  <cit> , lhts  <cit> , aaps  <cit> , ants  <cit>  and atl subfamilies   <cit> . and all aaap genes have a specific domain, pf <dig> .

to date, some functions of aaap proteins have been studied in model plants such as arabidopsis  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . ataap <dig> appears to be involved in amino acid uptake from the phloem and soil  <cit> . a recent study showed that ataap <dig> plays a role in amino acid uptake by the root  <cit> . ataap <dig> is expressed in roots, sink leaves, cauline leaves and xylem parenchyma, suggesting that it functions in amino acid uptake from the xylem  <cit> . in addition, ataap <dig> might play a crucial role in amino acid transport during fruit development  <cit> . in rice,  <dig> genes in the aap subfamily have been identified  <cit> , three of which  encode general aaap proteins, whereas osaap <dig> does not  <cit> . osaap <dig> transports the basic amino acids lysine and arginine and has distinct substrate specificity compared with other rice or arabidopsis aaps  <cit> . osaap <dig> is contribute to enhance root absorption and affect the distribution of various amino acids in early stages of seed development  <cit> .

bamboo, one of the most important non-timber forest products worldwide, comprises over  <dig> genera and  <dig>  species  <cit> . a majority of these species are distributed in the subtropical regions of china, especially regions south of the yangtze river. moso bamboo is an important species in china with the highest value in several areas among all bamboos, being used to produce timber, paper, artwork and food   <cit> . however, moso bamboo faces many types of environmental conditions during growth and development, such as high or low temperatures, salt concentrations and soil moisture levels, which limit its distribution and quality. a previous study showed that functional and regulatory proteins contribute to abiotic stress resistance in plant  <cit> , and aaap proteins are the fundamental functional proteins. therefore, in the current study, we investigated aaap proteins in moso bamboo to identify proteins that function in stress resistance. to date, bioinformatic analysis in model plants has greatly increased our understanding of aaap genes. in addition, the draft genome sequence of moso bamboo was completed in  <dig>  <cit> , providing a great bioinformatics foundation to perform a comprehensive genome survey of the aaap family in moso bamboo.

methods
identification of moso bamboo aaap genes
the conserved aaap domains  of rice aaap protein sequences were originally applied as seed sequences to search the ncgr database   <cit> . redundant sequences were removed manually based on the results of cluster w  <dig>  alignment  <cit> , and each candidate sequence was confirmed using the pfam   <cit>  and smart  databases  <cit> . the number of amino acids, cds lengths and physicochemical parameters of aaap genes were obtained from bamboo gdb . comparing coding sequence and the corresponding genomic dna sequences of aaap genes, we obtained their exon/intron structures from gsds. the tmhmm server version  <dig>   was used to predict the putative tm  regions of each peaaap protein with default settings.

phylogenetic and conserved motif analyses
multiple sequence alignment was performed using clustalx  <dig>  software  <cit> , and a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment with the n-j method using mega  <dig>  software and bootstrap analysis of  <dig>  replicates. the combined phylogenetic tree of osaaap, zmaaap and peaaap proteins was generated using the same method. the motifs of peaaap proteins were identified using the meme tool  .

calculation of ka/ks values
pairwise alignment of aaap genes encoding sequences of the orthologous and paralogous pairs was first performed using clustalx  <dig>  software and the results of alignment were subsequently further analyzed using the mega  <dig> , and then the synonymous substitution rate  and nonsynonymous substitution rate  were computed using dnasp  <dig> software  <cit> . the divergence time  was calculated using the formula t = ks/2λ   <cit> . the following parameters were used to perform sliding window analysis of the ka/ks ratios of all homologous gene pairs: window size, 150 bp; step size, 9 bp.

putative promoter region analysis
the  <dig> -bp upstream sequences of the genetic sequences were identified as putative promoter regions, which contains various cis-regulatory elements identified using the place website   <cit> .

plant material and growth conditions
eight-week-old seedlings were grown in artificial growth chamber with a constant photoperiod  and temperatures average around 22 °c. moso bamboo seeds for breeding seedlings were collected in the tianmu mountain national nature reserve in zhejiang province, china. in addition, the permission of seeds collection for the experiments was obtained from prof. dingqing tang of school of forestry and bio-technology, zhejiang a & f university. and the identification of these seeds was also performed by prof. dingqing tang. the seedlings were treated with 20% peg- <dig>  200 mm nacl and 4 °c to induce drought stress, salt stress and cold stress, respectively. in order to obtain reliable experimental data and reduce experimental error, for each sample, we executed three repeated trials for the same stimulation and carried out three biological replicates for expression analysis. for each induction treatment, we collected samples at six time points  and immediately stored at – 80 °c freezer for rna extraction. in addition, untreated plant materials  were used as the control group.

expression profile analysis
to study gene expression levels of peaaap genes in different tissues or development stages. the expression profile for each gene was obtained from short read archive  database of ncbi. and then the raw rna-seq reads of bioproject erp <dig> were trimmed to remove low quality base-calls  and adaptor sequences with pipeline fastq clean  <cit> . the paired clean reads were mapped to the phyllostachys heterocycla reference genome using pipeline tophat <dig> with defaults parameters, and different expressed genes were detected by cufflinks  <cit> . the heatmap of peaaap genes in seven different tissues and/or developmental stages  was exhibited using the heatmapper plus tool  <cit> .

qrt-pcr analysis
to research the expression levels of peaaap genes, qrt-pcr analysis based on sybr-green fluorescence was performed for each members of the aap subfamily. total rna was extracted from the plant samples using rna prep pure plant kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions, which was reverse transcribed into cdna subsequently using a primescript™ rt reagent kit . primer express  <dig>  was used to design the gene-specific primers of each peaap genes, and the tonoplast intrinsic protein  <dig>  was used as an internal control  <cit> . the following program was used for qrt-pcr: 95 °c for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95 °c for 10 s, 55 °c for 15 s, 72 °c for 10 s.

RESULTS
identification of aaap genes in moso bamboo
the aaap candidate sequences from the moso bamboo genome were verified using the pfam   <cit>  and smart  databases  <cit> . fifty-five potential aaap sequences were ultimately identified as aaap genes, which were designated peaaap <dig> to peaaap <dig>  detailed information about the  <dig> aaap genes was obtained using the moso bamboo gdb server , including the predicted lengths of cdss, sizes of encoded proteins and physicochemical parameters; this information is shown in table  <dig>  the lengths of the cdss range from 252 bp to  <dig>  bp, with an average size of  <dig>  bp. the identified aaap genes in moso bamboo with an average size of  <dig> aa, which peak on  <dig> aa and have a minimum value at  <dig> aa. the predicted molecular weights of the  <dig> peaaap gene products range from  <dig>  kda  to  <dig>  kda , with a mean value of  <dig>  kda. the predicted pis for the  <dig> peaaap gene products are below  <dig> , with most values approximately  <dig>  or  <dig> . however, the pi of one gene product  is below  <dig> , whereas one is greater than  <dig>  .table  <dig> detailed information about  <dig> predicted aaap proteins in moso bamboo

the gsds online tool was used to determine the exons/introns structure of each predicted peaaap gene . these results show that five peaaap genes  exclude introns, while the remaining genes contain 1– <dig> introns, and peaaap <dig> is no upstream and downstream . the tmhmm server v <dig>  was used to predict the putative tm regions of peaaap genes, which numbers in most genes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . interestingly, we found that genes of the same subfamily have similar numbers of tms, especially all members of auxs contain  <dig> tms. in aap subfamily, the numbers of tms was less than or equal to  <dig>  however, a previous report, showing that ataap <dig> had  <dig> tms  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship and gene structures of aaap proteins in moso bamboo. left: phylogenetic tree of peaaaps constructed by neighbor-joining method based on the results of sequence alignment. bootstrap values from  <dig> replicates were indicated at each node. the proteins on the tree can be divided into eight distinct subfamilies and the branches of different subfamilies were marked by different colors. there was a special noted that subfamilies atl were further divided into two groups . right: exons, introns and untranslated regions  were indicated by yellow rectangles, gray lines and blue rectangles, respectively




phylogenetic and conserved domain analysis of aaap proteins in moso bamboo
the phylogengtics tree was constructed based on the alignment of full-length amino acid sequences to evaluate the evolutionary relationship among these members of aaap family. the genes were divided into eight distinct subfamilies, and the aap subfamily is the largest one of all. to further examine the diversification of the peaaap genes,  <dig> distinct motifs  were found using meme web server . detailed information about the  <dig> putative motifs included names, widths and best possible matches were listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the functions of each motif were identified by searching pfam and smart database, showing that nine motifs  encode aa-trans domains, while the remaining  <dig> motifs do not encode any domain. interestingly, some motifs were specific to only one or two subfamilies. for example, motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are exclusively found in the aux subfamily, and motif  <dig> is only present in the aap subfamily. motifs  <dig> and  <dig> are found in all of the subfamilies except the atla and port subfamily, respectively. all members of the aux subfamily have similar numbers of motifs , indicating that the structures of members are highly conserved in the same subfamily.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the  <dig> conserved motifs in peaaap proteins. conserved motifs of the peaaap proteins were identified using the online meme program based on  <dig> full length amino acid sequences. each specific motif was marked by different colored box, and their names in the center of the boxes. the length of each box in the figure didn’t represent the actual motif size




evolutionary patterns and divergence of the aaap gene family in moso bamboo, rice and maize
we identified  <dig> paralogs  in the moso bamboo genome and  <dig> orthologs  between moso bamboo and rice, and  <dig> orthologs  between moso bamboo and maize, using phylogeny-based and bidirectional best-hit methods. the formula t = ks/2λ was used to evaluate the divergence times between moso bamboo, maize and rice, and relative ks values were used as a proxy for time. all of the paralogous and orthologous pairs are listed in table  <dig>  the distribution of ks values of paralogous pairs  peaked at approximately  <dig> , as shown in fig.  <dig>  this result suggests that aaap genes in moso bamboo have undergone a large-scale duplication event approximately  <dig> million years ago . the ks values distribution of orthologous genes  is shown in fig. 4a and fig. 4b, respectively. interestingly, both pe-os and pe-zm had the same peak at approximately  <dig> , showing that these genes have diverged approximately  <dig> mya. a previous study showed that bamboo underwent whole-genome duplication 7– <dig> mya, while rice and moso bamboo, as well as maize and moso bamboo, diverged  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya, respectively  <cit> . it indicated that the aaap family has undergone gene evolution after its separation from rice and maize. in general, ka/ks ratio less than  <dig>  equal to  <dig> and greater than  <dig> means negative or stabilizing selection, neutral selection and positive selection, respectively  <cit> . to investigate the trend of ka/ks ratio in the coding sequences of each gene pairs, we performed sliding-window analysis of pe-pe , pe-os  and pe-zm  gene segments, indicating that the aaap domains have undergone strong purifying selection  during the process of evolution.table  <dig> paralogous  and orthologous  gene pairs

putative promoter region analysis

cis-elements play critical roles in plant growth and development, including determining the tissue-specific or stress-responsive expression patterns of genes, and multi-stimulus-responsive genes are closely correlated with cis-regulatory elements in their promoter regions  <cit> . cis-elements have decisive effects on binding to target genes. in this study, we identified three type cis-elements, including cold-responsive, drought-responsive and salt-responsive elements in the promoter regions to help elucidate the potential functions of aaap genes in moso bamboo  <cit> . numerous cis-elements were widespread in the promoter regions, such as s <dig> and s <dig> for drought stress, s <dig> for salt stress and s <dig> for cold stress . moreover, contrasting with the cis-regulatory elements of salt stress, there was the higher amount of cis-elements for drought and cold stress. these results suggest that transcription factors that regulate aap genes may respond to abiotic stress and have the potential for improving abiotic stress responses, especially drought and cold. these findings may be helpful for further investigating stress tolerance mechanisms in moso bamboo.

comparative analysis of aaap genes in moso bamboo, rice and maize
to date, most studies have focused on analyzing the aaap family in rice and maize. to further analyze the evolutionary relationships between aaap genes in moso bamboo, rice and maize, we constructed an n-j phylogenetic tree  of aaaps using clustalx  <dig>  based on  <dig> full-length aaap protein sequences, including  <dig> sequences from moso bamboo,  <dig> from rice and  <dig> from maize. the detailed characteristics of the aaap genes from rice and maize are listed in additional file 7: table s <dig>  the phylogenetic tree clearly shows that the  <dig> aaap proteins could be divided into eight distinct groups. a count of the number of aaap proteins in every moso bamboo , rice  and maize  subfamily was performed. the result is consistent with the previous reports that aap subfamily is the largest one in aaap family among these three species. we also found that moso bamboo contains fewer aaap genes than rice and maize , suggesting that the peaaap genes have undergone a gene loss event after divergence from the last common ancestor of moso bamboo, rice and maize.fig.  <dig> phylogeny of aaap proteins from moso bamboo, rice and maize. the tree was generated with clustal x  <dig>  software using the neighbour-joining  method


fig.  <dig> comparison of aaap proteins from moso bamboo, rice and maize. a: comparison of aaap proteins from moso bamboo, rice and maize; different color represents different species, and numbers of aaap proteins in each species were marked. b, c and d showed that distribution and comparison of each subfamily for moso bamboo, rice and maize, respectively; different subfamilies were represented with different colors, and numbers of members in each subfamily were marked




differential expression profiling of moso bamboo aaap genes
in general, the overall analysis of gene expression profiles in different tissues will contribute to study the dynamic gene expression of aaap genes in moso bamboo. the high-throughput rna sequencing , as one of essential next generation sequencing technology, will allow to reveal a snapshot of rna presence and quantity from a genome at a given moment in time  <cit> . in addition, the draft genome sequence of moso bamboo has been released  <cit> . by now, many studies of expression profiles in several gene families were reported and mainly focused on different tissues . while, the genome-wide expression profile of peaaap genes still remains unclear.

we performed a microarray analysis to determine the expression level of each aaap genes on different tissues in moso bamboo based on the above advantages. finally, the heatmap was produced  based on the microarray data of  <dig> moso bamboo aaap  genes downloaded from the ncbi. from the microarray results, it was apparent that a few aaap genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. for instance, two genes  and peaaap <dig> were highly expressed in advanced panicle and leaves, respectively. while the rest members of peaaap genes showed express at least two tissues. above all, there are twenty-one genes  that were widely expressed in all these seven tissues or developmental stages, implying their essential roles in the process of moso bamboo growth and development.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of moso bamboo aaap genes across different tissues and development stages. heatmap showing hierarchical clustering of  <dig> peaaap genes across different tissues analyzed. color scale erected vertically at the right side of the picture represents log <dig> expression values, green represents low level and red indicates high level of transcript abundances. l, leaf; p <dig>  early panicle; p <dig>  advanced panicle; r, root; rh, rhizome; s <dig>  20-cm shoot; s <dig>  50-cm shoot. every member of aap subfamily was marked by red stars




six gene pairs  of these above identified exhibit distinct expression patterns in different tissues or developmental stages, suggesting that duplicated genes may have different evolutionary fates. for instance, peaaap <dig> is expressed at a high level in rhizome and shoots, however, its counterpart peaaap <dig> shows slight relative expression level. by contrast, remaining gene pairs have the same or similar patterns of expression accumulation.

qrt-pcr analysis of moso bamboo aaap genes
the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the aap subfamily contains  <dig> peaaap genes and that these genes are closely related to stress-responsive genes in rice. this observation prompted us to investigate possible stress-responsive genes among the  <dig> peaaap genes by qrt-pcr. we investigated the expression levels of  <dig> selected aap subfamily members  in the leaves of young seedlings in response to peg, salt and cold treatment using qrt-pcr. the specific primers used in qrt-pcr analysis of these genes are shown in additional file 9: table s <dig> 

for the peg  treatment ,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes  were distinctly upregulated in response to peg  treatment. four genes  were the most highly expressed during early  treatment, followed by a decrease in expression during subsequent treatment . the expression of two genes  peaked at 24 h. peaaap <dig>  peaaap <dig>  peaaap <dig> and peaaap <dig> were upregulated under 3 h peg  stress treatment and downregulated at later time points, especially peaaap <dig>  with an expression level over 150-fold higher at 3 h than at 0 h. by contrast, three genes  were downregulated under peg  stress treatment . in addition, there are three genes  were specific, showing slight  changes of expression level in response to peg  treatment.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of  <dig> selected aap subfamily genes in moso bamboo under peg treatment, as revealed by qrt-pcr. the y-axis and x-axis indicates relative expression levels and the time courses of stress treatments, respectively. error bars, 6 ± se




two genes in the aap subfamily  were downregulated by cold stress, whereas  <dig> other genes of this subfamily  were clearly upregulated by this treatment. six genes  were the most highly expressed during early  treatment, and their expression gradually decreased at all later time points . moreover, these genes were dramatically upregulated at the 1 h time point, especially peaaap <dig>  peaaap <dig> and peaaap <dig> . the expression of peaaap <dig> changed only slightly over the 24-h time course. three genes  exhibited similar trends in expression, with a gradual increase in expression during the early time points, a peak at 6 h and a significant, gradual decrease at all later time points. the expression of peaaap <dig>  peaaap <dig> and peaaap <dig> peaked at 3 h, while the expression level of peaaap <dig> was highest at 12 h .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of  <dig> selected aap subfamily genes in moso bamboo under cold treatment, as revealed by qrt-pcr. the y-axis and x-axis indicates relative expression levels and the time courses of stress treatments, respectively. error bars, 6 ± se




all  <dig> genes in the aap subfamily  were upregulated under nacl  stress treatment except for peaaap <dig> . only one gene  showed the highest expression level at 1 h, whereas the  <dig> other genes  exhibited similar expression patterns, with gradual increases in expression at the early time points and significant, gradual decreases at all later time points; the expression of all  <dig> genes peaked at 6 h .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of  <dig> selected aap subfamily genes in moso bamboo under nacl treatment, as revealed by qrt-pcr. the y-axis and x-axis indicates relative expression levels and the time courses of stress treatments, respectively. error bars, 6 ± se




in summary, the qrt-pcr results revel that  <dig> genes  exhibited significant changes in response to all three stress treatments, showing that these genes may exhibit different responses to abiotic stress. it was not difficult to found that these results accord with the putative promoter analysis results of aap subfamily members . there were several cis-elements showing a widely distribution in these members, such as elements s <dig> , s <dig>  and s <dig>  in drought, cold and salt stress response, respectively. these results suggested that a number of peaaap genes might play crucial roles in regulating abiotic stress responses.

discussion
as an indispensable gene family, the eukaryotic-specific aaap family plays a pivotal role in the process of plant growth and development, which is one of the largest families of aats identified to date  <cit> . according to previous studies, several aaap genes have been characterized both physiologically and genetically, such as arabidopsis aap and aux subfamily  <cit> , and rice aap subfamily  <cit> . by contrast, aaap family members have not previously been characterized in moso bamboo. therefore, in the current study, we identified and characterized  <dig> predicted aaap genes in moso bamboo using genome wide analysis, and compared these with  <dig> osaaaps and  <dig> zmaaaps, showing that the number of aaap genes in moso bamboo  is the fewest among these three species  <cit> . the  <dig> aaap proteins were found to be divided into eight distinct subfamilies, with every subfamily containing different members from these three species, meaning that aaap genes had diversified before moso bamboo, rice and maize split. a count of these subfamilies in different species shows that aap subfamily is the largest one. and aaap genes with the similar structure showed a tendency to be grouped into the same subfamily, we sought some more valuable evidence to support the reliability of the subfamily classification, including gene structure, motif compositions and tm regions. furthermore, all members in aux subfamily have the same numbers and types of tm regions, exon/intron structures and motif compositions, suggesting that these members share a closer evolutionary relationship in the process of aaap evolution. these results are in accordance with the results of a previous study of the aaap family in poplar  <cit> . furthermore, these results may show that the functions diversified among different members of aaap genes in mso bamboo. in addition, a previous study showed that aap <dig> had  <dig> tms in arabidopsis, which was different from aap subfamily in moso bamboo, signifying the divergence between different species.

recent gene duplication events, which help organisms adapt to different environments during growth and development  <cit>  as well as are an important evolutionary mechanism for the rapid expansion and evolution of gene families  <cit> . to better explain the patterns of macroevolution in moso bamboo, we calculated the value of ks and ka in moso bamboo, maize and rice. specifically, we estimated the ks and ka models of paralogous genes  and orthologous genes  and calculated the ks value for each gene pair. we estimated that a large-scale duplication event was occurred approximately  <dig> mya in moso bamboo and that the divergence times for orthologous genes  was approximately  <dig> mya. peng et al. estimated that the divergence time between moso bamboo and rice was  <dig>  mya, and maize was  <dig>  mya  <cit> . ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions  can be used to measure the history of selection acting on coding sequences  <cit> . in general, ka/ks ratio less than  <dig>  equal to  <dig> and greater than  <dig> means negative or stabilizing selection, neutral selection and positive selection, respectively  <cit> . interestingly, in this study, the ka/ks ratios were less than  <dig>  evidencing that the homologous gene pairs of aaap family in moso bamboo have undergone a markedly purifying selection in the course of evolution.

the overall analysis of gene expression profiles in different tissues will contribute to study the dynamic gene expression of aaap genes in moso bamboo. therefore, we displayed the gene expression profiles of  <dig> identified peaaap genes using published transcriptome data in ncbi database. among them, twenty-one genes  exhibited relatively high expression level in all seven different tissues or developmental stages, suggesting their importance in the processes of moso bamboo growth and development. while a few numbers of aaap genes show tissue-specific in this analysis.

in plant, many stress-related genes generated a series of stress responses to meet the adverse environmental condition during growth and development. aaaps are highly regulated by environmental signals and play positive roles in abiotic stress responses in many plants  <cit> . aap genes were previously studied in several species, leading to the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> genes in the aap subfamily in rice and arabidopsis, respectively. the expression pattern of a gene can provide significant clues about its function, as demonstrated by zhao et al.  <cit> . thus, we performed qrt-pcr to investigate the expression patterns of peaaap genes under peg, cold and nacl treatment. the peaap subfamily members showed significantly differential expression patterns under the three abiotic stresses examined. most peaap genes were upregulated by all three abiotic stress treatments, suggesting that peaap genes may play crucial roles in abiotic stress responses in moso bamboo. for instance, peaaap <dig> was highly expressed  under peg , cold and salt stress treatment. however, this gene shows a relatively lower expression frequency in leaf, meaning that peaaap <dig> responds to environmental stress. and conversely, some genes are unresponsive, especially peaaap <dig> has low expression level in both microarray and qrt-pcr analysis. furthermore, there were six paralogous pairs in aap subfamily. of these gene pairs, five of them  under cold treatment and two gene pairs  under salt treatment  had similar expression levels and tendency in the same paralogous pair. these results might suggest that homologous genes had similar putative functions in processes of organism growth and development.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated phylogenetic, gene structure, promoter region, divergence time, microarray analysis and qrt-pcr analysis of the  <dig> predicted aaap genes in moso bamboo. the qrt-pcr was used to explore the expression patterns of  <dig> selected aaap genes under three abiotic stresses: drought , salt  and cold . these results of this study increase our understanding of aaap family members, including their possible contributions to abiotic stress responses and other putative functions in process of moso bamboo growth and development.
