BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium that causes high rates of hospital-acquired infections, especially in immunocompromised patients  <cit>  as well as in patients with cystic fibrosis  <cit> . p. aeruginosa infections are often difficult to treat because the pathogen is capable of very rapidly acquiring a multitude of resistance mechanisms  <cit> , making multidrug resistant p. aeruginosa strains increasingly common and raising the need for new antipseudomonal drugs. the replication machinery of p. aeruginosa presents a good target for the development of new antimicrobial agents, since dna replication is essential for the survival of the pathogen.

dna polymerase iii holoenzyme is the main enzyme involved in the replication of the bacterial genome. in escherichia coli, this multiprotein complex is composed of ten distinct subunits that are arranged into three functional subassemblies  <cit> . the core subassembly contains the dna polymerase and the proofreading exonuclease activities  <cit> . the β-sliding clamp encircles the dna duplex while binding to the core and thereby tethering it to the dna template, ensuring high processivity and speed of the holoenzyme  <cit> . the clamp loader complex, composed of subunits τ/γ, δ, δ', χ and ψ, uses atp hydrolysis to load the clamp onto dna  <cit> .

the τ/γ, δ and δ' subunits together form the "minimal" clamp loader, 3δδ', which is sufficient for loading the clamp. the χ and ψ subunits are not essential for clamp loading  <cit> . however, χ is the only direct link between dna polymerase iii and ssb, the single-stranded dna-binding protein  <cit>  which coats single-stranded dna  at the lagging strand to protect it from degradation and to prevent hairpin formation. the ssb/χ interaction is necessary for the primase-to-polymerase switch, which involves a competition between dnag primase and χ in binding to ssb  <cit> . the ψ subunit bridges χ to the 3δδ' complex and has been shown to play an important role in stabilizing the clamp loader  <cit>  and increasing its affinity for the β-clamp  <cit> . in e. coli, χ and ψ form a tight 1: <dig> complex, the crystal structure of which has been solved  <cit> . the residues at the interface between χ and ψ are highly conserved across several bacterial species  <cit> , and the same holds true for a hydrophobic surface pocket of χ surrounded by basic residues which was shown to interact with the amphipathic c-terminus of ssb  <cit> . the disordered n-terminal part of ψ is also well-conserved, and is required for the binding of χψ to the minimal clamp loader  <cit> . however, in several bacterial genomes containing χ sequences in which the ψ-binding site appears to be conserved, ψ sequences cannot be found, suggesting that ψ has greatly diverged in these species  <cit> .

sequence comparisons between e. coli and p. aeruginosa identified the existence of all genes encoding the subunits of dna polymerase iii except for θ, a non-essential subunit of the core, and ψ  <cit> . the ψ subunit could only be identified as a  <dig> kda protein which copurified with the other dna polymerase iii subunits from p. aeruginosa cell lysate  <cit> . the start codon of the gene encoding this subunit was found to be incorrectly annotated in the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> genome, the actual start codon being a non-canonical uug present  <dig> nucleotides upstream from the originally annotated one. examination of the ψ amino acid sequence showed that it is divergent from and nearly twice the length of e. coli ψ. at the functional level, the p. aeruginosa χψ complex appears to play a more significant role than its e. coli counterpart. jarvis et al.  <cit>  observed that, under low salt conditions and at subsaturating levels of the τ3δδ' minimal clamp loader, the addition of p. aeruginosa χψ and ssb has a synergistic effect, increasing the activity of p. aeruginosa τ3δδ' 25-fold. in contrast, under similar conditions, e. coli τ3δδ' was insensitive to the addition of e. coli χψ  <cit> . at high salt concentrations, however, both χψ and ssb are required for efficient dna synthesis, in the p. aeruginosa as well as in the e. coli systems  <cit> .

this report describes the biophysical characterization of the χψ complex of p. aeruginosa, revealing properties which distinguish it from its e. coli counterpart and possibly account for its higher stimulatory effect. using analytical ultracentrifugation, we show that p. aeruginosa ψ, but not the e. coli ψ subunit, binds to ssdna under low salt conditions, even when the ssdna is coated with ssb. this binding results in an increased affinity of p. aeruginosa χψ toward the ssb/ssdna complex when compared to the e. coli system. in addition, we found that p. putida χψ also binds to ssdna, suggesting that dna-binding is a property of ψ proteins from the pseudomonadaceae.

RESULTS
biophysical characterization of paeχψ
to determine the composition of p. aeruginosa χψ , the complex was subjected to sedimentation equilibrium experiments in the analytical ultracentrifuge under high salt conditions. the concentration gradients obtained at three different rotor speeds  and two protein concentrations  could be globally fitted with a single molar mass of  <dig>  kg/mol. there was no indication of multiple species or aggregation. since the molar mass of a paeχψ heterodimer calculated from the amino acid composition is  <dig>  kg/mol, the protein exists as a heterodimer in solution. in comparison, examination of the χψ complex of e. coli  yielded a molar mass of  <dig>  kg/mol , confirming the formation of ecoχψ heterodimers  as reported previously  <cit> .

to characterize its hydrodynamic properties, the paeχψ heterodimer was examined in sedimentation velocity experiments in the analytical ultracentrifuge under high salt conditions. the data measured at three different protein concentrations were analyzed using the program package sedfit  <cit> . for paeχψ, the c distributions in a concentration range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm revealed a single species, sedimenting with an s <dig>  w of  <dig>  s, and gave no indication of significant impurities or aggregation products . even at the lowest protein concentration used, no change in the c distribution could be observed, showing that the χψ complex is stable under these conditions with no tendency to dissociate. in comparison, the c analysis for ecoχψ resulted in s <dig>  w=  <dig>  s and the complex also showed no tendency to aggregate at higher or to dissociate at lower protein concentrations .

from the calculated molar masses of the χψ heterodimers and the measured sedimentation coefficients, the frictional ratios f/f <dig> and the hydrodynamic radii rh were calculated. for the p. aeruginosa complex this resulted in f/f0=  <dig>  and rh=  <dig>  nm, whereas the e. coli complex yielded f/f0=  <dig>  and rh=  <dig>  nm. since the frictional ratios for hydrated spherical proteins are expected to be in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> , the shape of both protein complexes seems to deviate substantially from a sphere. for ecoχψ, this is in agreement with the results from the crystal structure  <cit> , where it was shown that the complex is elongated and that the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids of ψ are disordered. as the frictional ratio of paeχψ is even larger, a globplot analysis  <cit>  of the χ and ψ proteins was performed, which predicted the presence of two large disordered regions in the n-terminus of paeψ, while paeχ was predicted to be mostly globular .

to check the globplot prediction for paeψ, a truncated version of this protein was constructed in which the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids were deleted. this construct was coexpressed with full-length paeχ and both proteins could be copurified as a paeχψ complex. although the molar mass of this complex was reduced by  <dig>  kg/mol due to the truncation, it sedimented essentially with the same sedimentation coefficient as observed for full-length paeχψ . accordingly, the frictional ratio and the hydrodynamic radius dropped to f/f0=  <dig>  and rh=  <dig>  nm, respectively. this result makes it very likely that the n-terminal part of paeψ is disordered. it is worth noting, however, that the frictional ratio of the truncated complex is still higher than that of ecoχψ.

saxs measurements reveal that paeχψ is elongated in solution
to get structural information of paeχψ in solution, and to examine the lack of structure within the n-terminal part of paeψ in particular, we performed small-angle x-ray scattering  experiments of the full-length and the truncated protein complexes . high-throughput crystallization attempts with both paeχψ and paeχψ unfortunately failed to produce suitable crystals for x-ray crystallography, thus no high resolution structure could be obtained.

the shape of the saxs curve for full-length paeχψ directly suggests an elongated structure of the complex as it resembles a straight line in the lower s region   <cit> . analysis of the guinier-plot  vs. s2) for the lowest protein concentration  yielded a radius of gyration of rg=  <dig>  nm. from extrapolation of i to s=  <dig> and from porod volume we calculated molar masses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kg/mol, respectively. these observations are in good agreement with the theoretical mass of the paeχψ heterodimer and with the results of the sedimentation equilibrium experiments. the scattering curves were used to calculate the pair-distribution function, p . the plot for the full-length complex is typical of elongated molecules, which are described by functions with a maximum at smaller distances and which usually show tailing at higher distances  <cit> . the maximum particle diameter, dmax=  <dig>  nm, indicates an elongated shape of the χψ heterodimer. the analysis of the scattering data using a kratky-plot  suggests that the full-length complex probably contains extensive unfolded regions. a test set of independent ab initio structures, calculated using this dataset, shows large differences among the models and thus supports the idea of a potentially highly flexible part in the complex. to test whether it is the n-terminus of paeψ which is unstructured, we performed saxs experiments with the n-terminally shortened construct paeχψ. this construct also forms heterodimers , m=  <dig>  kg/mol from porod volume), but is obviously much more compact and does not possess large protrusions as can be deduced from the p-distribution  and the value of rg=  <dig>  nm. these results are also in good agreement with the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments.

we used the sequence of paeψ in a semi-automated homology search and modeling approach using the bioinformatics toolkit server  <cit> . the final output model obtained with the program modeller  <cit> , using ecoψ  as a template, was superimposed on the existing structure of ecoψ  <cit> . secondary structure prediction suggests that the paeψ n-terminus is potentially unstructured and therefore no structural relatives for this part could be identified. the additional insertions in the core of ψ, however, occur in extended or changed loop regions of ecoψ . these insertions, namely loops ii and iii, are probably largely unstructured, even though it can not be ruled out that they might fold back and extend the central core β-sheet. the presence of extended loop structures would be in accordance with the higher frictional ratio of the n-terminally truncated paeχψ compared to ecoχψ as measured by analytical ultracentrifugation.

based on hhpred analysis, the core domains of paeχψ and ecoχψ show high homologies; we therefore tested whether the ab initio shape calculated from paeχψ scattering data is able to harbor the in silico-generated paeψ-ecoχ heterodimer that we modeled. as paeψ is much larger than ecoψ, this model accounts for the putative presence of extended loops in paeψ as predicted from sequence alignment . the shape of the final ab initio saxs model of paeχψ  is clearly able to harbor both the modeled χψ-complex and the n-terminal residues 86- <dig> of paeψ, which are not present in our model but in the measured construct.

we further analyzed the saxs data of the paeχψ full-length complex using an alternative approach: lacking data to calculate reliable ab initio models due to the large and probably flexible n-terminus of paeψ, we performed an ensemble optimization method approach   <cit> . this procedure creates a large pool of random configurations and a genetic algorithm is used to select ensembles being in agreement with the experimental scattering data. for this approach we used our in silico-generated construct of paeψ and ecoχ as a rigid  core and defined the absent n-terminus of paeψ as a flexible part containing  <dig> residues. the rg-distribution obtained for the models in the selected ensembles is quite broad , supporting the idea of high flexibility . the chosen ensemble of structures was then superposed  to visualize the different conformations of the n-terminus which all fit to the measured scattering curve. additionally, we calculated the theoretical sedimentation coefficients of all structures in the chosen ensemble using hydropro  <cit> . the average s-value of s <dig>  w =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s is in very good agreement with our experimental data.

paeχψ binds to the highly conserved c-terminus of ssb
next, we compared ecoχψ and paeχψ at the functional level. since ecoχψ is known to interact through χ with the highly conserved c-terminus of ecossb, we investigated the interaction between paeχψ and paessb. when two molecules interact, they form a complex with a larger mass which usually sediments faster than each of the components. therefore, it is possible to analyze the interaction between χψ and ssb in sedimentation velocity experiments in the analytical ultracentrifuge, as described for the interaction of ecoχ and thermus aquaticus ssb  <cit> . because free χψ sediments slower than free ssb, paeχψ was titrated to a constant concentration of paessb in high salt buffer; for comparison, the same experiment was performed with the e. coli proteins. from the c distributions, the concentrations of free χψ were determined, and binding isotherms were constructed using a model for independent binding of n χψ complexes to one ssb tetramer . for the binding of ecoχψ to ecossb, we obtained an affinity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig>  which is in accordance with previously published data on this system  <cit> , and which is within the same range as the binding affinity of only ecoχ to ecossb  <cit> , suggesting that ecoψ does not play a role in the binding of ecoχψ to ssb.

for paeχψ and paessb, a similar binding affinity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig> was obtained under the same experimental conditions . the binding stoichiometry, however, is lower than in the case of e. coli. as both ssb proteins are known to form homotetramers  <cit> , there exist four potential binding sites for χψ, one at the c-terminus of each monomer. since the binding isotherm yielded a stoichiometry of n=  <dig>  for the e. coli system, each c-terminus of ecossb binds one ecoχψ complex . correspondingly, it has been shown that up to four ecoχ proteins can bind to ecossb  <cit> . in the case of p. aeruginosa, however, not all binding sites can be occupied . this might be due to the fact that paeψ is almost twice the size of ecoψ and that, as was shown above, the n-terminus of paeψ is highly elongated. thus, it is most probably sterical hindrance that prevents more than two paeχψ complexes from binding to ssb via χ.

to test whether paeχψ has the same binding site on ssb as the e. coli complex, we used the deletion mutant ecossbq152*  <cit> , which is truncated of the last  <dig> amino acids and which has been shown to be unable to interact with ecoχ  <cit> . under high salt conditions, we detected no significant interaction of either pae or ecoχψ with ecossbq152*, whereas paeχψ interacted with wild-type ecossb with a similar affinity than with paessb . since the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids of paessb and ecossb show 79% homology and the last  <dig> amino acids are identical  <cit> , this finding makes it very likely that the highly conserved c-terminus of paessb is the only binding site for paeχψ.

paeψ shows dna-binding activity
since the ssb proteins involved in dna replication form a tight complex with ssdna, we examined whether paeχψ not only binds to ssb but also directly to nucleic acids. we therefore tested the binding of paeχψ to fluorescently labeled 50mer-dsdna and 50mer-ssdna in electrophoretic mobility shift assays  under low salt conditions. both substrates clearly show shifts with increasing concentrations of paeχψ, indicating binding of the protein complex to the nucleic acids . however, ssdna is bound with a somewhat higher affinity than dsdna , suggesting that the complex seems to preferentially bind to ssdna.

to further characterize the binding to ssdna substrates, we then performed sedimentation velocity experiments in low salt buffer, titrating pae or ecoχψ to a constant amount of poly. the binding of the protein to ssdna was monitored by an increase in the sedimentation coefficient of the latter. whereas the addition of ecoχψ to poly did not significantly change the sedimentation coefficient of the ssdna, addition of paeχψ resulted in an increase from approximately  <dig> s to  <dig> s, indicating complex formation . therefore, in contrast to the e. coli complex, paeχψ shows binding to ssdna, which also supports the emsa results.

to characterize this binding, the amount of free paeχψ was determined from the c distributions, and a binding isotherm was constructed . the binding stoichiometry, defined as the amount of χψ bound per dt residue, was found to be  <dig> . therefore, one paeχψ complex is able to bind about eight dt residues with a binding affinity of approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> m- <dig>  it is worth noting, however, that the binding affinity of paeχψ to ssdna is salt-dependant, since it was weakened at increasing salt concentrations, and no binding was observed in high salt buffer . in this context, it is interesting to note that under low salt conditions, but not at elevated salt, ssdna increases the affinity of ecoχ to ecossb about 20-fold  <cit> . under elevated salt conditions, however, in addition to ssdna, the presence of all other clamp loader subunits, which themselves do not significantly interact with the ssb/ssdna complex, is required to increase the ssb-binding affinity of ecoχψ about 1000-fold  <cit> . this might be mediated by a conformational change in the n-terminus of ψ which accompanies the assembly of χψ into the clamp loader complex  <cit> . a similar conformational change is expected to occur in the conserved ultimate n-terminus of pae ψ, which might also increase the ssdna-binding affinity of paeχψ under elevated salt conditions.

to determine which protein within the paeχψ heterodimer is responsible for ssdna-binding, we wanted to investigate the interaction of poly with only paeχ or only paeψ. however, both proteins were insoluble if expressed on their own in e. coli and could not be purified. therefore, we tried to produce the chimeric complexes χecoψpae and χpaeψeco, but only ecoχ and paeψ formed a soluble complex. although these two proteins are from different organisms, they formed a stable homogeneous heterodimeric χecoψpae complex as revealed by sedimentation velocity experiments . this is most probably due to the fact that the residues at the χψ interface are conserved between e. coli and p. aeruginosa  <cit> . similarly to paeχψ, χecoψpae is able to bind to poly under low salt conditions . since we showed that ecoχψ does not bind ssdna , and under similar conditions no direct interaction between ecoχ and ssdna could be detected  <cit> , it has to be the ψ subunit within paeχψ which binds to ssdna.

to check whether the apparently unstructured n-terminal region of paeχψ is involved in the interaction with ssdna, we tested the binding of the truncated paeχψ complex to poly. as can be seen by the smaller increase in the sedimentation coefficient of the protein/ssdna complex compared to full-length paeχψ , less paeχψ can bind to ssdna. therefore, the n-terminal region of ψ is involved in ssdna-binding.

p. putida χψ also binds to ssdna
when the ψ subunit of p. aeruginosa was discovered  <cit> , a whole family of ψ proteins present within several species of the pseudomonadaceae was identified based on sequence comparisons. to test whether ssdna-binding is a general property of the pseudomonal ψ proteins, we cloned and purified the χψ complex from p. putida. in sedimentation velocity experiments with poly in low salt buffer, p. putida  χψ, similarly to paeχψ, increased the sedimentation coefficient of poly, indicating ssdna-binding .

paeχψ binds to ssdna covered by ecossb+gly
the ssdna at the replication fork is entirely covered by ssb  <cit> . to have an in vitro setting which most resembles the in vivo situation, the binding of paeχψ to ssdna complexed with ssb was analyzed. as this experiment is complicated by the fact that χψ also binds to ssb, we used a c-terminal extension mutant of ecossb, ecossb+gly. this protein carries an additional glycine residue at its c-terminus which dramatically weakens its interaction with ecoχ  <cit> . using sedimentation velocity experiments, we first confirmed that the binding of both pae and ecoχψ to this mutant is drastically reduced .

to test whether χψ can interact with ssdna even when ssdna is bound by ssb, a saturated complex of ecossb+gly and poly  was titrated with pae or ecoχψ in low salt buffer. when the ecossb+gly/ssdna complex was analyzed alone, it showed a sedimentation coefficient of approximately  <dig> s . the addition of ecoχψ increased the sedimentation coefficient only slightly, to about  <dig> s, which could be due to a weak binding of ecoχψ to ecossb+gly. the addition of paeχψ, however, increased the sedimentation coefficient from approximately  <dig> s to  <dig> s. this clearly shows the formation of a large ternary complex, indicating that paeχψ is able to bind to ssdna even when ssdna is covered by ssb.

paeχψ binds with a higher affinity to ssb/ssdna complexes than ecoχψ
to test whether the ability of paeχψ to bind both paessb and ssdna results in an increased affinity toward ssb/ssdna complexes, its binding to paessb in the presence or absence of poly was examined in low salt buffer, and the results were compared to the e. coli system. for this purpose,  <dig>  μm of the respective ssb protein, with or without saturating amounts of poly, were titrated with pae or ecoχψ, and were analyzed in sedimentation velocity experiments. figure  <dig> shows that the binding affinity of both paeχψ and ecoχψ toward the ssb/poly complex is significantly enhanced compared to the affinity toward free ssb protein, which is consistent with the observation that under low salt conditions, the affinity of ecoχ to ecossb is increased about 20-fold in the presence of ssdna  <cit> . this is most probably due to a conformational change of ssb induced by the binding to long stretches of ssdna, making the highly conserved c-terminal region more easily accessible for interaction with other proteins  <cit> .

in the absence of poly, the binding was too weak to determine the binding parameters for either p. aeruginosa or e. coli . due to the aggregation of paeχψ at higher protein concentrations at low salt, the binding could not be examined at concentrations which would have allowed for the determination of the binding parameters. the binding of paeχψ to the ssb/ssdna complex, however, is so strong that even at the lowest concentration that can be applied in auc experiments using the absorbance optics, stoichiometric binding was observed and the affinity is larger than  <dig> ×  <dig> m- <dig> . therefore, the affinity of paeχψ to ssb/poly is at least eight times higher than the affinity of the respective e. coli proteins . this is most probably a result of the ssdna-binding affinity of paeψ which enhances the stability of the ternary complex, when compared to that of the e. coli system.

CONCLUSIONS
the χ and ψ subunits are part of the clamp loader of dna polymerase iii holoenzyme. whereas ecoχ and paeχ have a similar size and show about 40% sequence homology, paeψ is nearly twice as large as its e. coli counterpart. the n-terminal residues of ψ that are needed for the interaction with the minimal clamp loader  <cit>  and the residues involved in binding χ  <cit>  are conserved, however paeψ contains additional sequences that are absent from the e. coli protein. we showed by homology-based modeling that these additional sequences do not interfere with secondary structure elements of ecoψ, but can be assigned to loop regions of the protein .

analytical ultracentrifugation experiments revealed that paeχψ has a higher degree of asymmetry than its e. coli counterpart. this asymmetry is reduced by the truncation of the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids of paeψ. saxs experiments of paeχψ and of this truncated variant, as well as molecular modeling, strongly support the idea that the n-terminus of paeψ is elongated and probably highly flexible. our results show that this n-terminus is responsible for ssdna-binding of paeχψ under low salt conditions, a property which can not be found in ecoχψ.

additionally, we could show that also p. putida χψ is able to bind to ssdna. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the dna-binding of ψ subunits of dna polymerase iii. homology searches within the pseudomonadaceae revealed several proteins related to paeψ, all containing extra sequences absent from ecoψ, which were in many cases highly conserved  <cit> . one conserved region is located in the unstructured n-terminus of ψ, includes several positively charged amino acids and might be responsible for the binding of the pseudomonal ψ proteins to dna .

using an ecossb mutant impaired in χψ binding, we showed that paeχψ is even able to bind to ssdna that is covered with ssb. furthermore, we demonstrated that the affinity of paeχψ to ssb/ssdna complexes is significantly increased compared to the e. coli system. this fact is most probably due to the ability of paeψ to bind to ssdna. it has been shown that under low salt conditions only paeχψ has a significant influence on dna synthesis by its cognate dna polymerase iii  <cit> . the addition of paeχψ and ssb shows a synergistic effect, increasing the activity of the minimal clamp loader paeτ3δδ' 25-fold, whereas ecoτ3δδ' is insensitive to the addition of ecoχψ  <cit> . even though it might not be the only mechanism, the binding of paeψ to dna very likely contributes to the higher stimulatory effect of paeχψ on the minimal clamp loader in the presence of ssb. since we showed that the χψ complex of p. putida is also able to bind dna, this stimulatory effect might be a characteristic of pseudomonal χψ complexes.

in spite of the fundamental aspects of this work, the full understanding of the dna polymerase iii holoenzyme of p. aeruginosa, and of its ψ subunit in particular, may reveal new targets for the development of specific inhibitors of pseudomonal dna replication. the most striking difference between the e. coli and pseudomonal χψ complexes identified in this work is the ssdna-binding ability mediated by the n-terminus of paeψ. since we showed that this region is unstructured, it can probably not be used directly in antipseudomonal drug design. however, it is tempting to speculate that this region might fold upon ssdna-binding and one of our future objectives is to solve the structure of a paeχψ/ssdna complex.
