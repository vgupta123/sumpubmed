BACKGROUND
legumes are a diverse and important family of angiosperms. with more than  <dig> genera and  <dig>  species, legumes are the third largest family of higher plants and are second only to grasses in agriculture  <cit> . peanut or groundnut is one of the major economically-important legumes that are widely grown in china, india, united states, and many countries in south america and africa. peanut is important for its ability to grow in semi-arid environments with relatively low inputs of costly resources such as chemical fertilizers. peanut is also a major source of protein and vegetable oil for human nutrition on a global basis. on average of the years,  <dig> to  <dig>  peanut was grown on  <dig>  million hectares with a total global production of  <dig> million metric tons http://www.nass.usda.gov/publications/ag_statistics/ <dig>  in the same period, the u.s. peanut crop averaged  <dig> thousand hectares with a total production on average of  <dig>  million metric tons  concentrating in nine southern states, including alabama, florida, georgia, new mexico, north carolina, oklahoma, south carolina, texas, and virginia.

there is considerable variation in arachis hypogaea subspecies hypogaea and fastigiata, which are further classified into runner, virginia, spanish, and valencia market types  <cit> . most cultivated peanuts belong to spanish and runner types. they exhibit genetically-determined variation for a number of botanical and agronomical traits including branching and flowering habits, seed dormancy, and maturation time. however, cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid , with little polymorphism at the molecular level  <cit>  as indicated by using traditional markers such as rapd and rflp. pairing in a. hypogaea is generally bivalent, with occasional higher-order associations found in crosses among different market types  <cit> . cultivated peanut is considered to have originated from a single recent polyploidization event  <cit> , unlike many other natural polyploidy species for which polyploidization events have been identified. the most likely wild diploid progenitors for cultivated peanut are a. duranensis  and a. ipaensis   <cit> . even though peanut is an important crop economically and nutritionally, narrow genetic diversity and a deficiency of polymorphic dna markers in the public database have hindered genetic mapping and the application of molecular breeding in cultivated peanut. nevertheless, the peanut research community still lacks adequate tools and resources for peanut genetic and genomic research and breeding, and therefore, for expanding our basic knowledge of the genetic control of complex traits.

a genetic map constructed from a population segregating for a trait of interest is required for qtl  identification. peanut exhibits a considerable amount of variability for morphological traits and for resistance to insects and diseases. however, a more detailed linkage map of all chromosomes and with sufficient markers is necessary to be feasible for qtl identification and marker-assisted selection. there is one rflp map of diploid peanut developed from the interspecific hybridization  of two related diploid species with aa genome  of peanut with  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> . there is another rflp map of a synthetic interspecific tetraploid population {4× × a. hypogaea} using  <dig> bc <dig> population with  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> . because of the complex pedigree, this map is complicated and difficult to use in terms of extraction of useful information. moretzsohn et al.  <cit>  published a ssr-based linkage map  for the aa genome of diploid wild peanut  with  <dig> ssrs and  <dig> linkage groups, and an advanced version of same map has been published with  <dig> markers, including  <dig> microsatellites,  <dig> legume anchor markers,  <dig> aflps,  <dig> nbs profiling,  <dig> snp,  <dig> rga-rflp and  <dig> scar markers, mapped into  <dig> linkage groups by leal-bertioli et al.  <cit> . hong et al.  <cit>  published a ssr-based map  for cultivated peanuts with  <dig> ssr and  <dig> linkage groups. varshney et al.  <cit>  published the most recent intra-specific map constructed from the cross of cultivated peanuts, in which  <dig> ssr markers were sparsely populated in  <dig> linkage groups. foncéka et al.  <cit>  published a ssr-based map using  <dig> individuals of the bc1f <dig> population of [fleur  <dig> × 4×, and  <dig> loci were mapped in  <dig> linkage groups . nevertheless, the application of biotechnology to the improvement of the allotetraploid cultivated peanut has been hampered by an inability to visualize genetic variation and by lacking a road-map.

simple sequence repeat  markers are pcr  based markers that are reproducible and detect co-dominant multi-allelic loci  <cit> . recent studies have shown that ssrs can detect more polymorphism in cultivated peanut than rflp, rapd and aflp  <cit> . in recent years, a large number of ssr markers for peanut have been developed from genomic dna libraries and expressed sequence tags  with the goal of providing sufficient sequence resources for developing a critical mass of dna markers for the community  <cit> , making it feasible to use ssrs to construct a genetic linkage map.

the various peanut maps constructed to date have few markers in common and it is impossible to conduct comparative mapping. ssr-based markers provide a set of easily shared markers that can be used to unify and cross reference established genetic maps. the ssrs developed in this study will provide an important resource for genetic mapping and marker-assisted selection, as well as for comparative genetic studies between cultivated and wild peanuts  and other legumes. therefore, the objective of this study was to construct a ssr-based composite reference map for cultivated peanut using public available ssr sources  <cit> , genbank  <cit>  and newly developed ests  <cit> . the ssr primers and the ril populations used in this study will be made available to other researchers for comparative mapping, qtl analysis and map improvement .

RESULTS
three mapping populations of recombinant inbred lines  of cultivated peanuts were derived from three crosses with a common female parent, yueyou  <dig> , a spanish bunch type with high yield. the populations were advanced to the f <dig>  using single seed descent. individual plants were harvested and progeny rows were grown to produce the f4: <dig> ril populations.

a total of  <dig> ssr primer pairs were collected and designed to amplify ssr markers in these parental lines, including  <dig> genomic-ssrs and  <dig> est-ssrs . among the screened ssrs,  <dig> primer pairs  did not produce clear amplification products, and were not included in the rils genotype screening. the remaining  <dig> primer pairs were used in polymorphism screening and genotyping among the parental lines and rils. a total of  <dig> ssr markers detected polymorphism in at least one mapping population. there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> polymorphic ssrs in the y13zh, y13fu, and y13j <dig> populations, respectively. in this study, markers derived from genomic dna were more polymorphic than markers developed from ests; the percentages of genomic ssrs displaying polymorphisms were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % in these three populations, respectively, whereas only  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of est-ssrs showed polymorphism in the corresponding populations. the  <dig> polymorphic ssr primer pairs amplified  <dig> segregating loci, of which  <dig> primer pairs  detected duplicated loci, which are designated by an arabic number  appended to the locus name to distinguish the two loci . locus duplication was inferred by the fact that the two loci amplified with the same primer pair was mapped to different locations or linkage groups .

linkage groups from population y13zh 
for population y13zh,  <dig> ssr markers, detected  <dig> loci, were scored and used for the construction of the linkage groups  by joinmap software  <cit> . the markers were assigned to linkage groups at a lod  threshold of  <dig>  the genetic map derived from this population contained  <dig> loci on  <dig> linkage groups  spanning a total genetic distance of  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers remaining unlinked. the length of each linkage group was varying from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  and each had  <dig> to  <dig> markers. this population y13zh was also used for map construction by hong et al.  <cit>  resulting in  <dig> ssr loci on  <dig> linkage groups. we have analyzed the original genotyping data and improved the linkage groups that have been included in the composite map .

thirty-four loci showed segregation distortion in this population,  <dig> of which were distributed on  <dig> linkage groups . the number of markers showing segregation distortion varied from  <dig> to  <dig> per linkage group. fifty-eight percent  of the distorted loci were in favor of the alleles of parental line y <dig>  the most extreme example of segregation distortion was found on lg <dig> where all ten loci showed segregation distortion . lg <dig> showed an average skewed ratio of 10: <dig> instead of 1: <dig> over its entire length, severely favoring alleles from parental line zh.

linkage groups from population y13fu 
a total of  <dig> ssr polymorphic markers, detected  <dig> loci that were segregating in population y13fu. a linkage map was constructed at a lod threshold of  <dig> or higher. there were  <dig> loci mapped into  <dig> linkage groups  , spanning a total genetic distance of  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers remaining unlinked. on average, this map had  <dig> to  <dig> markers on each lg and the length of each linkage group varied from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  .

seventeen loci showed segregation distortion in this population and  <dig> were assigned on individual linkage group. there were  <dig> loci in favor of y <dig> alleles and  <dig> in favor of alleles of parental line fu. the  <dig> distorted loci were distributed on  <dig> linkage groups with  <dig> loci distributed on lg <dig>   <dig> in lg <dig>  and  <dig> in lg <dig>  the remaining loci were distributed on lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> .

linkage groups from population y13j <dig> 
a total of  <dig> markers were segregating in population y13j <dig>  a scaffold map was obtained at a lod of  <dig> and higher. forty-six markers were assigned into  <dig> linkage groups  and  <dig> markers remained unlinked. seven markers were mapped onto lg <dig> and lg <dig>  six loci were mapped onto lg <dig>   <dig> loci were mapped to lg <dig>  and  <dig> loci were mapped to each of lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  the remaining  <dig> markers were mapped onto  <dig> linkage groups. there were  <dig> markers that showed segregation distortion in this population. two of them were mapped on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  the other three distorted markers could not be assigned onto any linkage group. the length of the map was shorter than the other two maps. it covered  <dig>  cm.

composite genetic linkage map 
on the basis of these three maps developed from three ril populations, a composite map was constructed . to construct a composite map, linkage groups in the individual maps with common markers were assigned onto an integrated linkage group. therefore, the composite maps with  <dig> linkage groups  were established, of which  <dig> derived from integration of linkage groups in two or three individual maps. the summary of the composite linkage map is presented in table  <dig>  this composite tetraploid map consists of  <dig> composite linkage groups with  <dig> ssr marker loci including  <dig> genomic-ssrs and  <dig> est-ssrs, covering  <dig>  cm of total map distance . the mean interval between adjacent markers is  <dig>  cm, and 85% of the intervals between adjacent ssr markers were smaller than  <dig> cm. eight intervals  between adjacent markers were between  <dig> and  <dig> cm. among the  <dig> marker loci,  <dig> loci with distorted segregation were mapped on the composite maps, and the majority were mapped on lg <dig> , lg <dig> , lg <dig>  and lg <dig> .

the segregation distortion was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the polymorphic markers in these three populations. there were only  <dig> est-ssrs mapped due to low polymorphism. a total of  <dig> markers were in common in at least two of the three mapping populations. seventeen markers were genotyped in all three populations. in addition, there are  <dig> more common markers between populations y13zh and y13fu;  <dig> more markers between populations y13zh and y13j <dig>  and  <dig> more ssr markers between populations y13fu and y13j <dig>  based on the common markers and the comparison between individual maps, the majority of the linkage groups were consistent among the individual maps with few exceptions . for example, the  <dig> markers on lg <dig>  in the population y13zh were placed on two lgs in the population y13fu  . the markers on lg <dig> in population y13zh  distributed in  <dig> lgs  in population y13fu . the listed inconsistencies may be due to the low density of this linkage map as showing the markers derived from the same linkage group in one population were assigned into different linkage groups in another population .

comparison of the composite tetraploid peanut map to the aa diploid peanut map
forty-seven ssrs mapped previously on the aa genome of diploid wild peanut   <cit>  were mapped on the current tetraploid cultivated peanut genetic map . moretzsohn et al.  <cit>  developed a ssr-based linkage map with  <dig> ssrs and  <dig> linkage groups. there were  <dig> sets of ssrs on the aa diploid map were identified corresponding to  <dig> lgs on the tetraploid map , and the largest set of ssr marker common to both maps were  <dig> that were conservative and collinear in each linkage group, which were mapped on the tetraploid lg <dig> and aa diploid group  <dig>  four ssrs mapping to group  <dig> were placed on lg <dig>  interestingly lg <dig> has  <dig> ssrs mapped on group  <dig> and  <dig> ssrs mapped on group  <dig>  indicating that lg <dig> involves groups  <dig> and  <dig>  there were  <dig> common markers on group  <dig> that were placed on lg <dig> , lg <dig> , and one each on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  suggesting that lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> may belong to one linkage group. tetraploid lg <dig> has one marker from group  <dig> , two ssrs from group  <dig> and two from group  <dig>  but  <dig> ssrs mapped on group  <dig> were also placed on lg <dig>  giving evidence that lg <dig> and lg <dig> may belong to one linkage group or vice versa. another interesting comparison is that  <dig> ssrs mapped on group  <dig> were placed on lg <dig>  and lg <dig> , supporting that lg <dig> and lg <dig> should be one linkage group. therefore, these ssr markers could provide a set of easily shared markers that can be used to cross reference the tetraploid map to ssr-based aa genome map. on the basis of these common ssr markers, the conservation of collinear linkage groups among these three maps and the composite map and the aa genome wild progenitor  could be determined, however, marker order was not fully conserved.

discussion
a composite linkage map was constructed from three individual ril mapping populations with  <dig> ssr markers on  <dig> composite linkage groups. the three ril mapping populations, y13zh, y13fu and y13j <dig>  were derived from crosses using a common female parent y <dig>  a spanish bunch type with high yield. the male parents were a virginia type with dark purple testa and high protein content , a spanish type with high oil content , and a spanish type with reported resistance to a. flavus and aflatoxin contamination  <cit> . therefore, these ril populations could be used for qtl studies for several important traits. this map also consists of  <dig> ssrs that have been used in the published aa genome map  <cit>  and could be used in comparative mapping studies. the important contributions are the collected  <dig> ssr primer pairs provided as an additional files, and the three ril populations are also made available to public upon request for qtl analysis and linkage map improvement.

the composite genetic linkage map length and segregation distortion
the composite genetic linkage map covers  <dig>  cm and comprises  <dig> loci distributed over  <dig> linkage groups. seven of the linkage groups include only  <dig> or  <dig> markers, which could have resulted from the low density of markers. these small linkage groups could be artificial and additional genetic markers are needed to improve the linkage analysis and the assignment. the composite map distance was much shorter than the one of the synthetic tetraploid map with rflp markers   <cit>  and the two maps of the aa genome   <cit> . several factors could account for the reduced length of the composite map compared to the other three maps in arachis. the first factor could be that the markers on the composite map were far from saturated. the  <dig> markers distributed on the map were much fewer than the synthetic tetraploid map which consisted of  <dig> rflp markers. the second factor could be the different mapping software used in the linkage analysis. in general, maps constructed with joinmap are shorter than those constructed with a multilocus-likelihood package such as mapmaker or outmap  <cit> .

marker distance and linkage group lengths were consistently larger with mapmaker than joinmap, even using the same mapping function   <cit> . for comparison we also constructed the linkage groups for population y13fu using mapmaker . the results also showed that the linkage groups constructed with joinmap  were much shorter than those constructed with mapmaker . the multilocus-likelihood method used by mapmaker assumes an absence of crossover interference; when interference is present, joinmap correctly produces shorter maps, even though both programs use the kosambi mapping function  <cit> . this difference was also observed in other studies  <cit> .

the segregation distortion was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the polymorphic markers in these three populations. a total of  <dig> markers were in common in at least two of the three mapping populations. seventeen markers were genotyped in all three populations. in addition, there are  <dig> more common markers between populations y13zh and y13fu;  <dig> more markers between populations y13zh and y13j <dig>  and  <dig> more ssr markers between populations y13fu and y13j <dig>  based on the common markers and the comparison between individual maps, the majority of the linkage groups were consistent among the individual maps with few exceptions . for example, the  <dig> markers on lg <dig>  in the population y13zh were placed on two lgs in the population y13fu  . the markers on lg <dig> in population y13zh  distributed on  <dig> lgs  in population y13fu . the listed inconsistencies may be due to the low density of this linkage map as showing the markers derived from the same linkage group in one population were assigned into different linkage groups in another population .

segregation distortion has been reported and the reasons for distortion of segregation ratios may be due to the factors such as chromosome loss  <cit> , genetic isolation mechanisms  <cit> , and the presence of viability genes  <cit> . non biological factors such as scoring errors  <cit>  and sampling errors  <cit>  can also lead to distortion in segregation ratios. the proportions of distorted markers in population y13zh is higher  than in the population y13fu  and population y13j <dig> . both biological and not biological factors could cause the observed segregation distortion in these populations.

comparison of the composite tetraploid map and the aa diploid map
on this tetraploid map there are  <dig> ssrs from the aa diploid wild peanut   <cit> . therefore, these ssr markers could provide a set of easily shared markers that can be used to cross reference the tetraploid map to ssr-based aa genome map. on the basis of these common ssr markers, it could determine synteny between cultivated peanut and wild progenitor. the primary goal for the construction of this composite map was to place, relative to one another, as many ssr markers as possible onto a single map. therefore, the concern is more towards obtaining a general order and distance among these makers rather than the fine resolution of order and distance. with  <dig> ssr markers, this map will be a useful resource and a reference map, in which markers may be selected for future mapping projects within a. hypogaea and for comparative studies among other arachis species. for example, combining information from multiple pedigrees is necessary if important traits do not segregate within a single population. often, it is not practical or necessary to construct complete genetic maps to identify the genomic location of the traits. however, such studies can still be related to the entire genome by selecting markers suitable for superimposing the detailed region onto the composite map. in comparison with the ssr-based aa genome map  <cit>  there are agreements in the composite map to the aa map, such as lg <dig> and group  <dig>  the comparative map will provide interesting information in genomic structure analysis and the relationship between the diploid wild species and the tetraploid cultivated peanuts. this ssr-based tetraploid reference map provides a framework and represents an ideal starting point for future mapping projects in arachis since the stable and transferable ssr makers of the map can be saturated with other types of makers such as snp and integrated into a consensus enhanced-density tetraploid map for arachis in the future.

low polymorphism of est-ssr
only  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of est-ssrs produced useful polymorphic makers in these populations. in contrast, when genomic dna sequences were used as the source of ssr-containing sequences,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % yielded markers that were polymorphic in these populations. the possible explanation is that markers derived from genomic sequences contained more repeat units as well as a greater range of allele sizes and genetic diversity than markers isolated from est libraries. the striking difference of polymorphism between the peanut ssrs derived from the two sources is consistent with differences reported in other crops. for example, arshchenkova and ganal  <cit>  reported that only  <dig> of  <dig>  tomato ests contained ssrs of more than ten repeat units. in barley est-derived ssrs were generally shorter  than genomic dna-derived ssrs   <cit> . the average number of repeats from est-derived and genomic dna-derived ssrs was  <dig>  versus  <dig>  in sugarcane  <cit> . smulders et al.  <cit>  reported that ssr markers derived from fewer repeats were reported to be significantly less polymorphic than markers generated from longer repeats. other factors such as selection against large alterations in coding regions and associated sequences that may play a role in gene expression could constrain ssr expansion or contraction. such constraints could contribute to the reduced polymorphism of est-ssrs.

CONCLUSIONS
this manuscript reports the construction of a ssr-based map of a. hypogaea. the primary goal for the construction of this map was to develop a framework for future improvement. with  <dig> ssr markers, this map will be a useful resource and tool, in which ssr markers may be used for future mapping projects. in comparison with the ssr-based aa diploid map, clearly there is homologus or synteny between lg <dig> of tetraploid map and group  <dig> of aa diploid map. this ssr-based tetraploid map provides a valuable genetic framework for qualitative and quantitative trait analysis in a. hypogaea. in addition, most of the primer sequences of ssr markers used in construction of current map were derived from the original papers. thus, researchers from different laboratories can use these markers for map development and comparative mapping. all the markers used in this study have been made available as additional files and the rils will be available to collaborators upon request. in concert with other maps in progress, this reference map represents an ideal starting point and provides a framework since the stable and transferable ssr makers can be saturated with other types of makers such as snp. we could develop a consensus enhanced-density tetraploid map for a. hypogaea.
