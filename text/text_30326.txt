BACKGROUND
the small gtpases of the ras superfamily have been implicated in diverse cellular functions, including regulation of ion channel activity, cytoskeleton reorganization, nucleocytoplasmic transport, vesicular trafficking, cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . all ras-gtpases share conserved amino acid sequences, the g <dig> to g <dig> motifs, which regulate the gdp/gtp exchange and gtp hydrolysis, and thus trigger multiple intracellular signaling cascades  <cit> . switch i and switch ii are flexible regions around g <dig> and g <dig>  respectively, which change conformation upon gtp/gdp exchange, thus facilitating interactions with its effectors, gtpase-activating proteins  and guanine nucleotide exchange factors   <cit> . ras-gtpases generally exhibit slow dissociation of gdp for gtp and low intrinsic gtp hydrolysis rate, which are strictly enhanced by gefs and gaps, respectively  <cit> .

the gtr <dig> protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae  is a multifunctional gtp-binding protein, involved in phosphate acquisition through modulation of pho <dig> transport activity  <cit> , ribosome biogenesis  <cit>  and epigenetic control of gene expression  <cit> . it has also been shown that the gtr <dig> protein is a subunit of the ego/gse complex, which is indispensible for intracellular sorting of the amino acid permease gap <dig>  <cit> , gtr <dig> has been implicated in regulation of the tor signaling cascade in response to amino acids  <cit> . most recently, it has been proposed that the switch regions are essential for activation of the tor <dig> complex   <cit> . despite an otherwise low sequence similarity, the g motifs in gtr <dig> display high conservation with other ras gtpases, and are located within the n-terminal gtpase domain of the protein  <cit> . the c-terminal domain of the protein has been implicated in self-interaction  <cit>  and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in contrast to ras homologues, the gtr <dig> protein lacks lipid modification motifs in its c-terminal region, and the g <dig> motif  contains a histidine instead of an asparagine residue  <cit> .

gtr <dig> belongs to the distantly related raga family, which displays a low sequence similarity with the ras, rab, ran, arf and rho proteins  <cit> . the gtr <dig> protein displays 52 % and 47 % sequence identify with the mammalian rag gtpases raga and ragb, respectively  <cit> . notably, recent studies have shown that the gtr <dig> and raga proteins share a similar mechanism of amino acid-mediated tor activation, indicating that these proteins are functionally conserved in eukaryotes  <cit> . s. cerevisiae also contains gtr <dig>  which corresponds to ragc/ragd in humans. like the mammalian rag gtpases, gtp-bound gtr <dig> and gdp-bound gtr <dig> form a stable heterodimeric complex in vitro <cit> . the gtp-bound form but not the gdp-bound gtr <dig> interacts with itself, whereas gtr <dig> can interact with itself only in the presence of gtp-bound gtr <dig>  <cit> . most recently, the 3d-structure of the gtr1-gtr <dig> complex in the gmp-pnp bound form was resolved at  <dig>  Å resolution  <cit> . the structure has brought insights into the location of g domains and switch regions. based on this, it was proposed that upon nucleotide exchange the switch regions change conformation, allowing for interaction with raptor and activation of torc <dig>  <cit> . in the same report, it was shown that the c-terminal domains of the two proteins mediate heterodimeric complex formation that is indispensible for activation of tor signaling pathways.

previous studies have localized the gtr <dig> protein both to the nucleus and to the cytoplasm  <cit> , where it interacts in a gtp-dependent manner with diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, such as ego <dig>  yrb <dig>  nop <dig> and ego <dig>  <cit> . based on competition studies, it was proposed that the gtr <dig> protein displays higher affinity for gtp than for gdp  <cit> . the gtp-bound form of gtr <dig> interacted with the rpc- <dig> subunit of rna polymerases i and iii in yeast two-hybrid assays, indicating a role in the assembly of rna polymerase  <cit> . recently, the vam <dig> protein, known as a gef for ypt <dig>  was shown to assist the exchange of gdp/gtp on the gtr <dig> protein in vitro <cit> . moreover, binda et al.  <cit>  have reported that vam <dig> activates the gtr <dig> subunit of the ego complex during torc <dig> function.

gtr <dig> harbors all the necessary structural elements for functioning as a gtpase. previous attempts to estimate the gtpase activity of gtr <dig>  <cit> , raga  <cit>  and ragc proteins  <cit>  resulted in either none or too low activity to be measured. here we quantify the intrinsic gtp hydrolytic activity of purified recombinant gtr <dig> protein and several variants using a radioactive gtpase assay, and in addition study their tryptophan fluorescence emission properties.

methods
gene cloning, heterologous expression and purification
s. cerevisiae full-length gtr <dig> proteins , arg37cys and val67cys) were expressed in escherichia coli and purified in a single step by affinity chromatography essentially as described  <cit> . the complete procedure is provided in additional file  <dig>  the protein expression levels and purity of the preparations were assayed as described  <cit> . the oligomeric state of gtr <dig> was assayed by native gel electrophoresis as described  <cit> 

assay of gtpase activity
the gtpase assay was carried out using purified recombinant protein at a final concentration of  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> ,  <dig> nm gtp and  <dig> nm  gtp  in a 50 μl containing assay buffer  as described in ref.  <cit> .

the enzymatic reaction was carried out at 37 °c for the indicated time periods , and terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 4 m formic acid. a volume of  <dig>  μl  quenched reaction mixture was spotted onto a poly -cellulose plate  and the nucleotides were separated by thin-layer chromatography using  <dig>  m kh2po <dig>  as elution buffer. the radioactive nucleotides were detected by phosphorimaging . the radioactive gdp spots were quantified using multigauge software . the data are given as means ± sd and were obtained from 2– <dig> independent experiments. initial velocities for gtp hydrolysis were measured using the same assay conditions at varying  gtp concentrations  for 60 min. the data were plotted as a function of gtp concentration, and fitted to the michaelis-menten equation. a lineweaver-burk plot of the data was used to determine the values for the michaelis-menten constant  and the maximum velocity  parameters. the catalytic constant kcat was calculated as the vmax/et ratio, where et is the enzyme concentration.

intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
tryptophan  fluorescence spectra of purified recombinant gtr <dig> proteins were recorded using a fluoromax- <dig> spectrofluorometer  in the presence of guanine nucleotides. the interaction of the protein with guanosine 5’-o-  or gdp was measured using  <dig>  mg ml- <dig>  protein and 25 μm nucleotides in the gtpase assay buffer. the reaction mixture was incubated for 120 min at 37 °c prior to fluorescence measurements  <cit> . the intrinsic protein fluorescence was excited at 297 nm, and emission spectra were recorded in the range  <dig> to 400 nm at 25 °c. the spectra of free nucleotides in assay buffer were subtracted from the collected sample dataset.

sequence alignment
sequence alignments of gtr <dig> from s. cerevisiae with other yeast and mammalian members of raga family and with human h-ras were obtained using clustalw . the location of g motifs, switch regions and residues mutated in this work are highlighted in the alignment. the position of the nucleotide-binding domain of gtr <dig> , of the switch i and ii regions, of the mutated arg <dig> and val <dig> residues, and the tryptophan residues, trp <dig>  trp <dig> and trp <dig>  are indicated in the x-ray crystal structure of gtr <dig> .

RESULTS
the gdp/gtp exchange and intrinsic gtp hydrolytic activity are the most important functions for all regulatory gtpases. in order to characterize the properties of gtr <dig>  an n-terminal his6-tagged version of the full length gtr <dig> protein was stably over-expressed using a bacterial production system and purified by a single step affinity chromatography  <cit> . based on sds-page analysis, the purity of the recombinant protein was estimated to 95 % and the mr to 36 kda. the identity was confirmed by western blot analysis using an anti-his antibody . the oligomeric state of the recombinant protein is monomeric since the recombinant protein migrates at 36 kda in native gel electrophoresis .

intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the purified gtr <dig> protein
trp fluorescence has been widely used as a tool to study structural changes upon nucleotide binding to ras gtpases  <cit>  the gtr <dig> protein harbors three trp residues, namely trp <dig>  trp <dig> and trp <dig> . conformational alterations upon nucleotide binding to gtr <dig> could result in changes in the local environment of these trp residues in the protein structure. figure <dig> shows the fluorescence emission spectra of purified gtr <dig> wild-type protein in the presence of gdp or gtpγs. when loading the gtr <dig> wild-type protein with nucleotides, we observed a blue shift of 2 nm in the tryptophan fluorescence emission between the gtpγs-bound form  and the gdp-bound form  . this indicates a more hydrophobic localization of the tryptophan residues upon gdp binding, and thus a more compact overall conformation. furthermore, the data presented in figure <dig> indicate that the recombinant gtr <dig> wild-type protein has retained the nucleotide binding functionality. taken together, our results indicate that gtr <dig>  like other gtpases, can adopt two distinct conformations, corresponding to the gtp-bound and gdp-bound state, which can be monitored by tryptophan fluorescence. this tool has been used to study several mutants in the work, as described below. 

the peak intensity measurements in the gtpγs-bound form of each protein were normalized to those measured for the gdp-bound form. wavelengths of the emission maxima measured are also presented for the gdp- and gtpγs-bound proteins. data shown in the table are means±sd of two independent measurements.

intrinsic gtpase activity of the purified gtr <dig> protein
previous attempts to measure the gtpase activity of gtr <dig> and raga proteins have failed  <cit> , and thus the proteins were considered to lack gtpase activity in the absence of activators. a weak gtpase activity has been indicated for ragc  <cit> . here we measure the intrinsic gtpase activity of gtr <dig> using  gtp and purified wild-type gtr <dig> in assay conditions similar to those previously described  <cit> . as shown in figure5a, as result of the hydrolytic activity, gdp was produced in amounts increasing with the incubation time in samples containing purified protein, whereas gdp production was absent in control samples devoid of protein. the chromatography plates were overloaded with radioactive sample, and therefore, the corresponding decrease in the gtp amount resulting from its hydrolysis could not be detected. the ratio between the amount of gdp and the total amount of gdp + gtp reached a maximum of 30 % at the incubation time of 120 min, in line with the previous report for ragc 16].

next, we determined the enzymatic kinetic parameters of the protein under similar assay conditions as described in methods. values of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  nmol gdp mg protein-1 min- <dig> were obtained for the km and vmax parameters by michaelis-menten analyses . the obtained values were used to calculate the kcat of the protein,  <dig>  min- <dig>  for reference, the kcat values determined for three representative gtpases, namely gial, ras and ef-tu are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  min- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the finding of an extremely low gtpase activity implies a strict regulation, for example interaction with other proteins, such as gtr <dig>  in addition, vam <dig> has been proposed as a gef for gtr <dig>  <cit> . it will be important to understand the way this key gtpase is regulated by activating proteins to control various processes.

role of arg <dig> and val <dig> in the gtpase activity of the gtr <dig> protein
we have previously used epr spectroscopy analysis on site-directed mutants of gtr <dig> and showed that only the n-terminal part of the protein harbors the structural elements involved in gtp binding  <cit> . in the same study, we examined the conformational changes upon gtp binding of gtr <dig> in the regions around residues arg <dig> and val <dig>  these residues are located at the border of switch i and ii region, respectively . sequence analysis indicated that the arg <dig> residue is highly conserved within the raga family, but is not present in other ras gtpases . on the other hand, the val <dig> residue is not conserved in either rag or other ras proteins. residues arg <dig> and val <dig> were, however, chosen for mutagenesis since the activities of the two switch regions could be monitored without completely abolishing gtp/gdp-binding. we have tested the functional importance of these residues in gtr <dig> by measuring the gtpase activity of arg37cys and val67cys mutants constructed in a cys-less background . in addition to offer the ability to modify the cysteine thiol-group with spectroscopic probes, the relatively low bulkiness of the cysteine side chain as well as its chemical ambivalence makes the cysteine residue a suitable replacement to study the dynamics of the switch regions. as shown in figure <dig>  the amino acid sequence of the gtr <dig> protein contains five native cysteine residues, of which cys <dig> and  <dig> reside in the n-terminal gtpase domain, whereas cys <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are located in the c-terminal domain. the creation of a functional gtr <dig> cys-less, in which serine residues replaced all five native cysteine residues, has been previously described  <cit> . all three mutant proteins  were purified under similar conditions as the wild type  gtr <dig> protein. western blot analysis shows similar levels of the expressed proteins . we first analyzed the gtpase activity of the cys-less mutant. the amount of gdp produced by the cys-less mutant was found to be slightly higher than that in the wt at 30 min, followed by a gradual decrease to wt levels during prolonged incubation with gtp . this result indicates that cysteine residues may not be essential for the gtpase activity, which is consistent with previous reports on other ras gtpases  <cit> . the arg37cys mutant exhibits a diminished gtp hydrolytic activity  throughout the incubation period . in contrast, the val67cys mutant displayed about 25 % higher gtpase activity than the wt protein. these results indicate the importance of arg <dig> and val <dig> for the intrinsic gtpase activity of gtr <dig>  in the absence of interacting proteins such as gef and gtr <dig> 

intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the gtr <dig> mutants
next, we investigated if the effect of mutations on the gtpase activity could be explained by the dynamics in the protein structure. for this purpose, all mutant gtr <dig> proteins were analyzed for tryptophan fluorescence in a similar manner as performed for the wt protein. as observed in the wt, the emission maxima in all mutant proteins, displayed a blue shift between gdp and gtpγs forms, , indicating that environmental changes for the trp residues contribute to the observed blue shift. the blue shift from the gdp to the gtpγs states in arg37cys was the smallest  whereas in val67c is the largest . notably, a blue shift was also visible in both the gdp and gtpγs-bound states of all mutants relative to the wt, indicating a more hydrophilic environment for the trp residues in the mutants. again, arg37cys and val67cys distinguished themselves from the cys-less mutant since they display the largest blue shifts relative to the wt in both nucleotide bound states. a third interesting difference was the higher fluorescence intensity observed for both the gtpγs and gdp forms in the cys-less mutant as compared to all other samples, and might be explained by changes in the degree to which trp fluorescence is quenched by neighboring residues in this mutant. the observed difference cannot be attributed to possible nucleotide-induced aggregation of the protein as similar levels of the protein were indicated in all samples by native page analysis . moreover, this difference may have no relevance for the gtpase activity in the cys-less mutant, which displayed wt levels. taken together, the fluorescence data indicate that distinct conformational changes occur in the arg37cys and val67cys mutants that could impact on their performance during the gtpase assays .

role of arg <dig> in the crystal structure of gtr1-gtr <dig> complex
recently, the crystal structure of the gtr1-gtr <dig> complex, with the two proteins bound to gmppnp, was solved  <cit> . this structural model served as a template to design and analyze the role of raga in activating torc <dig>  mutational analysis of several residues indicated that the surface charge potential is of great importance for raga to interact with raptor, and thus being able to activate torc <dig>  <cit> . of the two adjacent arginines close to the switch i region and which are conserved amongst the gtr <dig> and raga region , we have mutated arg <dig> to a cysteine and have observed a change in hydrolytic activity. the removal of one of the two arg residues might alter the surface charge to a degree where a minimal conformational alteration could influence the nucleotide interaction. whether this charge alteration effectively results in a conformational change that impairs nucleotide binding is currently not known. our results indicate that a replacement of arg <dig> with a cysteine leads to a decreased hydrolytic activity, supporting the importance of this residue.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have employed a combination of structural, cysteine mutagenesis, radioactive gtpase assays and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence approaches to study the biochemical activity of gtr <dig> from s. cerevisiae. the data obtained reveal a very low intrinsic gtpase activity of the gtr <dig> protein as compared to ras gtpases, implying requirement for activating proteins, as previously reported  <cit> . this activity was found altered in arg37cys and also val67cys mutants of the switch regions and associated with conformational changes, which are distinct from those in the wt and cysteine-less mutant. despite the fact that both mutated residues are not fully conserved amongst gtr <dig> homologues, alterations made in those positions have an influence on the gtpase activity and fluorescence. this indicates that both residues are of importance for the functionality of gtr <dig>  our findings provide insights into the function of gtr <dig> and its homologues in yeast and mammals.
