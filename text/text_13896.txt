BACKGROUND
diabetes is known to accelerate the process of atherosclerosis, in which endothelial dysfunction plays a key role  <cit> . previous studies have shown that diabetes alters the expression of a variety of molecules involved in maintenance of endothelial function  <cit> . animal experiments also demonstrated that induction of diabetes, either alone or on top of hyperlipidemia, suppress the expression of endothelial gap junctions  <cit> . gap junctions are cell membrane channels made of paired hexamers of connexins, which allow exchange of ions and small signaling molecules between the cytoplasmic compartments of adjacent cells. in mammals endothelial cells mainly express connexin <dig> , cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  <cit> , of which cx <dig> is by far the predominant in the cultured endothelial cells  <cit> . several reports have shown that endothelial cx <dig> gap junctions are down-regulated by factors causing endothelial dysfunction  <cit> , such as aging  <cit> , hypertension  <cit> , and arsenic trioxide  <cit> , the last of which was even reported to induce endothelial lesion. in contrast, other factors causing endothelial dysfunction, such as oscillatory shear stress, were shown to enhance cx <dig> expression  <cit> .

one key offending factor underlying the toxic effects of diabetes is glucose, the high level of which had been proved to affect the activities of endothelial cells in many aspects, including suppression of gap junctions  <cit> . since diabetes is associated with a more severe form of vascular disease, we suspected that molecules underlying the detrimental effects of diabetes other than glucose also affect endothelial gap junctions.

during chronic exposure to elevated blood glucose advanced glycation end products  are generated in the circulation. age are also versatile molecules and have been reported to possess multiple actions in the vascular wall, such as changes of release of cytokines, induction of expression of cell adhesion molecules, impairment of endothelial vasodilatation, and triggering of chronic inflammation  <cit> . however, the effect of age on endothelial gap junctions remained unclear. to this end, we examined the expression of cx <dig> as well as the gap-junction communication in human aortic endothelial cells  treated with age and explore underlying mechanisms. a previous study had shown that the average serum age levels in diabetic patients ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml and may reach 160- <dig> μg/ml in severe cases  <cit> .

methods
generation of age-bsa
age-bsa was prepared by incubation of bsa  at a concentration of  <dig> mg/ml with  <dig>  m glucose in  <dig> mm phosphate-buffered saline  containing  <dig>  mm edta, ph  <dig> , at 37°c for  <dig> weeks. for a control group, the same concentration of bsa was incubated with pbs containing edta without glucose for  <dig> weeks. free glucose was removed by extensive dialysis against pbs. the brown color of age-bsa showed the typical appearance of age. sds-page analysis showed the formation of age-bsa monomer and dimer with molecular weights approximately equaling to  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively. however, unglycated bsa was about  <dig> kda. the ratio of relative fluorescence intensities of age-bsa to unglycated bsa was approximately  <dig> folds in our preparations. results were consistent with other's report  <cit> . for a control group, bsa was processed as above procedures. bsa and age-bsa were stored at -70°c until use.

cell culture
haecs  were seeded in 1% gelatin-coated plasticware and incubated at 37°c under a humidified 95% air and 5% co <dig> atmosphere. cells grown to confluence were dissociated with  <dig> ml of  <dig> % trypsin-edta  at 37°c for  <dig> min. the suspension was diluted with  <dig> ml medium  <dig> supplemented with lsgs, centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min, and resuspended in the culture medium. cells were then replated in 35-mm petri dishes  and allowed to grow to confluence or seeded at the same density onto 12-mm glass coverslips coated with 1% gelatin . cells of passage  <dig> to  <dig> were used in the subsequent experiments. to evaluate the relative mrna level of cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  human umbilical vein endothelial cells , maintained in endothelial cell growth medium  were used as a reference. the confluent cells were treated with age-bsa at series concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> and  <dig> hours. for a control group, cells were treated with bsa at series concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> hours. for examination of activation of mapk signaling pathways, cells were incubated with age-bsa at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> and  <dig> hours. for time course experiments, cells were incubated with age-bsa at  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours. for drug treatments, cells were treated with  <dig> μm of pd <dig> ,  <dig> μm of sb <dig> , and  <dig> μm of sp <dig>  for  <dig> min and then incubated with  <dig> μg/ml age-bsa for  <dig> hours.

western blotting
cells were collected in ripa buffer containing  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta, 1% np <dig>   <dig> mm pmsf, and  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig>  or sb buffer containing 20% sds,  <dig>  m tris-hcl, ph  <dig> , and  <dig> mm edta followed by sonication for  <dig> sec. thirty microgram of sample was loaded in each lane, resolved by 12% sds-page, and transferred onto a pvdf membrane . the membrane was incubated with the monoclonal anti-cx <dig> antibody , anti-cx <dig> antibody , anti-β actin antibody , anti-erk antibody , anti-p <dig> mapk antibody , anti-jnk antibody , anti-phosphorylated erk antibody , anti-phosphorylated p <dig> mapk antibody , and anti-phosphorylated jnk antibody  at room temperature for  <dig> hour. after three washes with tbst , a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse igg  was added, and an enzyme-linked chemiluminescence system  was applied to check the bound antibody.

real-time pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr
total rna was extracted using trizol reagent  according to the manufacturer's instructions. after phenol treatment and drying, rna was dissolved in rnase-free water for determination of concentration using spectrophotometer. rna quality was checked on agarose electrophoresis. for real-time pcr analysis, endothelial cdna were amplified with primers specific for cx <dig>  , cx <dig>  , cx <dig>  , and β-actin   using iqtm sybr green supermix reagent and detected with iqtm single color real-time pcr detector system . relative mrna levels were normalized with the corresponding levels of β-actin.

for semi-quantitative rt-pcr, total rna  was reverse-transcribed into complementary dna  using the superscrip™ ii reverse transcriptase and random primers  according to the manufacturer's recommendations and diluted with ddw to a final volume of  <dig> μl. the optimal number of pcr cycles was determined for cx <dig>  and gadph  so that the amplification process was conducted during the exponential phase of amplification. amplification of the gadph gene transcript was used as the internal control to stringently control for any variability in rna degradation and rt efficiency. reactions were carried out in a  <dig> μl final reaction volume.

immunofluorescence detection
confluent cells grown on coverslips were fixed with methanol at -20°c for  <dig> min. after blocking with  <dig> % bsa, the cells were incubated with the anti-cx <dig> antibody  at 37°c for  <dig> hour, followed by incubation with a cy <dig> conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody . the cells were then incubated with fitc-conjugated lectin ulex europaeus agglutinin- <dig>  for  <dig> hour to confirm the identity of endothelial cells  <cit>  or bisbenzamide  for  <dig> min. finally, the cells were mounted and examined using a leica tcs sp confocal laser scanning microscope.

scrape loading assay
gap-junction communication in haecs treated with  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa for  <dig> and  <dig> hours was evaluated by scrape loading assay. for drug experiments, haec were respectively pretreated with i)  <dig> μm of pd <dig> and ii)  <dig> μm of sb <dig> prior to addition of the age-bsa  for  <dig> hours. the medium of confluent cells were removed and rinsed with hank's balanced salt solution . a 27-gauage needle was used to create multiple scrapes through the cell monolayer in the presence of pbs containing  <dig> % rhodamine-dextran and  <dig> % lucifer yellow. after  <dig> min of incubation at room temperature, the culture was rinsed three times and then incubated for  <dig> min in medium  <dig> supplemented with lsgs to allow the loaded dye to transfer to adjoining cells. the cells were viewed and recorded using a fluorescence microscope.

mtt assay
cells were incubated in medium  <dig> supplemented with lsgs containing  <dig>  mg/ml mtt . after  <dig> hour, the mtt solution was removed and dimethylsulfoxide  was added.

absorbances  of the supernatant were read using a microplate spectrophotometer . cell viability was expressed as the percentage of the absorbance values of treated cells to controls.

analysis
densitometric scanning and analysis were performed on immunoblots and gel images using imagemaster . within each lane, total amounts of bands of cx <dig> were divided by those of actins as loading controls. for rt-pcr, amounts of cx <dig> were divided by those of gadph. for the scrape loading assay, the area between the bilateral edges of lucifer yellow transfer and the scrape line was measured. the value of total amount of each sample was presented as mean  ± s.e. the significant differences are analyzed by t-test.

RESULTS
real-time pcr showed that cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig> existed in both haec and huvec. however, the expression levels differed markedly . regarding haec, cx <dig> transcripts were more than 10-fold abundant, compared to cx <dig> or cx <dig> , in contrast to huvec, in which cx <dig> was the most abundant. in addition, the relative mrna expression levels of individual connexins in haec were lower than those in huvec . consistently, immunoconfocal examination of the untreated haec showed that cx <dig> was abundantly expressed at the cell borders, typical for gap junctions, but cx <dig> and cx <dig> were rarely seen . treatment with age-bsa for  <dig> hours at doses of  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml lead to a marked reduction of cx <dig> and cx <dig> and cx <dig> remained rarely seen . therefore, the following experiments in haec were focused on cx <dig> 

in cells treated with age-bsa at doses from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml for 24- <dig> hours, no changes of the cell density and morphology were observed . however, cells became slightly retracted and reduced in density after treated with  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa for more than  <dig> hours . for cx <dig>  regardless of the  <dig> or  <dig> hours treatment, the levels of expression gradually decreased as the dose of age-bsa increased . western blotting also verified the dose-dependent effect of age-bsa on cx <dig> expression . after exposure to  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa for  <dig> hours  and  <dig> hours , the relative expression levels of cx <dig> protein were respectively reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . a control group of cells treated with dialyzed, long term stored bsa for  <dig> hours showed no changes of cx <dig> proteins . there was no difference in decreasing trends or patterns of cx <dig> proteins extracted from age-bsa-treated cells with lysis buffers containing np <dig> or sds as well as no difference in cx <dig> expression when the samples were detected using anti-cx <dig> antibodies from various sources . the function of gap-junction communication was checked using the method of scrape-loading/dye transfer . the areas of dye transfer were significantly reduced in cells treated with  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa for  <dig> hours and  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa for  <dig> hours . moreover, because cells were not well contacted after exposure to  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa for  <dig> hours, the inhibition of gap-junction communication was unable to quantify . the effects of age-bsa on viability of cells after exposure for  <dig> hours were assessed using mtt assay. the relative viability of cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , respectively  .

to explore whether alteration of cx <dig> expression by age-bsa was regulated through mapk cascades, three signal pathways, erk, jnk, and p <dig> mapk were separately blocked before addition of age-bsa. pd <dig>  an mek <dig> inhibitor which blocks erk pathway, significantly reversed the reduction of cx <dig> proteins in cells treated with age-bsa for  <dig> hours . similarly, sb <dig>  a p <dig> mapk inhibitor, also significantly reversed the reductions . the basal levels of cx <dig> proteins were not affected after the addition of these inhibitors. in contrast, no such effects were seen in cells treated with sp <dig>  a jnk inhibitor . immunoconfocal microscopy also confirmed that age-bsa induced reduction of cx <dig> was reversed by pd <dig> or sb <dig> to the levels comparable to the control group and the reversed cx <dig> mainly located at cell borders . the gap-junction communication was measured when cells were treated with  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa for  <dig> hours in the presence of either pd <dig>  or sb <dig> . whereas cx <dig> proteins returned to approximately the control levels , the areas of dye transfer remained close to those of cells treated with  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa for  <dig> hours . taken together, our results indicated the reversed cx <dig> by mek <dig> or p <dig> mapk inhibitor remained at the cell borders but exhibited impaired communication function.

in addition, to understand the effect of age-bsa on protein synthesis at the transcription level, cx <dig> transcripts was measured using semi-quantitative rt-pcr, which showed a dose-dependent decrease of the transcripts in cells treated with age-bsa for  <dig> hours . this effect was more obvious after treatment for  <dig> hours . moreover, the decrement of cx <dig> transcripts at exposure of  <dig> μg/ml of age-bsa followed a time-dependent manner, as early as  <dig> hours, a significant decrease was noticed . the down-regulation of cx <dig> transcripts by age-bsa  seen at  <dig> hours was significantly reversed in cells pre-treated with pd <dig> or sb <dig> . no affections on the basal levels of cx <dig> transcripts were seen after the addition of these inhibitors. this indicated that the age-bsa-induced reduction in cx <dig> transcription was mediated by erk and p <dig> mapk. phosphorylation of erk and p <dig> mapk was activated dose-dependently in cells treated with age-bsa for  <dig> hours  and  <dig> hours , while no such change was seen in jnk. taken together, these data indicated that the down-regulation of cx <dig> expression was through erk and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways.

discussion
this study demonstrates that, in cultured haec, i) cx <dig> is the predominant gap junction component protein, unlike huvec; ii) age-bsa reduced cx <dig> transcript expression in a time-dependent manner; and iii) age-bsa reduced cx <dig> protein expression and attenuated gap-junction intercellular communication in a dose-dependent manner; although a substantial portion of haec died when the cells were treated with high dose of age-bsa  for more than  <dig> hours, the down-regulating effects of age-bsa on cx <dig> expression should not be mainly attributed to a general reduction in protein expression during cell dying, since the expression level of actin protein along the reduction of cx <dig> was relatively stable . in addition, inhibition of gap-junction communication activity may cause cell death, as seen in retinal capillary cells, in which attenuation of gap-junction communication with high glucose treatment disturbed normal transport of small molecules and calcium ions, leading to cell death  <cit> . the reduction of cx <dig> transcripts by age-bsa was partially recovered by inhibitors of each of the erk <dig> and p <dig> mapk. moreover, the activation of the mapk cascades was further confirmed by the increase of phosphorylated erk and p <dig> after a short time exposure to age-bsa indicating that activation of both the erk and p <dig> mapk cascades is involved in this process. despite the down-regulation of cx <dig> expression by age-bsa can be abrogated by the inhibitors and the reversed cx <dig> mainly stayed at the cell borders, the gap-junction communication was impaired. these novel findings are complementary to our current knowledge regarding the effects of diabetes on endothelial gap junctions.

the results of the present study, in conjunction with those from other in vitro experiments investigating the effect of high glucose on endothelial gap junctions  <cit> , indicate that in the circulation of diabetic individuals high glucose per se as well as the glycated albumin, which is generated in high glucose milieu, affects endothelial gap junction. interestingly, both the actions of high glucose and the glycated albumin on endothelial gap junctions may share similar mechanisms. in cultured microvasular endothelial cells treated with high glucose, the cx <dig> mrna was reduced  <cit> . the same effect was observed for the age-bsa-induced down-regulation of cx <dig> in this study  <cit> .

phosphorylation of the members of connexin, including cx <dig>  is well known to play a key role in regulation of gap-junction communication  <cit> . the effects of phosphorylation on the communication can be either enhancing or inhibiting. the phosphorylation status of cx <dig> is believed to affect the oligomerization of cx <dig> into connexons and delivery of integral connexins to justified locations  <cit> . of the kinases involved in phosphorylation of cx <dig>  erk and p <dig> mapk were reported to attenuate the gap-junction communication  <cit> . these data mainly came from non-endothelial cells. on the other hand, activation of the erk and p <dig> mapk cascades was also reported to affect the expression level of cx <dig> protein. in cultured smooth muscle cells isolated from human saphenous vein, inhibition of erk and p <dig> mapk by using sirna specific to the kinases were shown to attenuate the enhanced expression of cx <dig> induced by angiotensin ii  <cit> . considering in the present study that i) a close association between the age-bsa-induced reduction in the cx <dig> mrna level and the reduction of cx <dig> protein is appeared; ii) the down-regulation of endothelial cx <dig> transcript and protein by age-bsa is blocked by inhibitors of kinase  cascades; and iii) phosphorylations of erk and p <dig> mapk were activated dose-dependently, one may question whether in endothelial cells after exposure to age-bsa there is a link between activation of the mapk and enhanced proteolysis of cx <dig>  as reported in lens epithelial cells that phosphorylation is a signal for cx <dig> proteins to enter a proteasome-dependent degradation  <cit> . moreover, activation of the erk and p <dig> mapk cascades in endothelial cells exposed to age-bsa results in regulation of cx <dig> protein in a direction opposite to that seen for smooth muscle cells  <cit> . recent findings indicated that age-hsa  could promote endothelial progenitor cells  senescence and apoptosis via erk and p <dig> mapk pathways, leading to the down-regulation of the number of epcs  <cit> . this decreases the protective capacity of epcs on atherosclerosis in diabetic patients and increases their risks for cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . similarly, glucose, age, and methylglyoxal, the precursor of age, could enhance apoptosis of human cardiac myocytes and collagen deposition, an important event of diabetic cardiomyopathy, in rat cardiac fibroblasts accompanied by temporal activation of erk1/ <dig>  p <dig> mapk, and nuclear o-glcacylation  <cit> . taken together, our findings in the present study suggested that reduced cx <dig> transcription is the major mechanism underlying the down-regulation of cx <dig> protein in haec treated with age-bsa. more studies are required to determine whether an increased turnover rate of cx <dig> plays a significant role in this process. although the down-regulation of cx <dig> expression was abolished by inhibitors, these rescued cx <dig> proteins may already lose their membrane-association and consequently be unable to assemble properly to exert their activity. it is also possible that gap junctions were induced to partially close during the blockage of those signaling pathways. these two phenomenons were already reported in cells under certain physical and chemical offenses  <cit> .

down-regulation of cx <dig> gap junctions in endothelial cells by age-bsa has implications in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy, which, as mentioned before, starts with endothelial dysfunction  <cit> . our recent findings indicated that in endothelial cells down-regulation of cx <dig> per se activates the cells to a pathological status, in which pro-coagulatory molecules, such as plasminogen activation inhibitor  <dig> and von willebrand factor, were up-regulated and the viability, angiogenic capacity, and proliferation of the cells were reduced  <cit> . these changes of endothelial cells due to insufficient expression of cx <dig> may further aggravate the harmful effects of age-bsa on the vascular cells.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provided the evidence that age-bsa down-regulated cx <dig> expression in haec, mainly through reduced cx <dig> transcription, and this process involved activation of erk and p <dig> mapk.
