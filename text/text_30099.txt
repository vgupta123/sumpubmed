BACKGROUND
although there are intensive research efforts on feeding behavior and food habit, little is known about the formation and evolution of herbivory. previous studies have reported that the gut microbiota in herbivores play an important role in nutrient digestion and assimilation  <cit> . sullam et al. suggest that herbivorous fish and mammals share the process of gut fermentation to obtain nutrients from plants  <cit> . however, many herbivorous fishes display low levels of gastrointestinal fermentation  <cit> . several freshwater herbivorous fishes such as grass carp do not rely on microbial cellulolysis, but rather pass large quantities of plant material rapidly through the gut  <cit> . little is known about the molecular mechanism of the formation of herbivory. grass carp  is an ecologically appealing model of vertebrate herbivore, widely cultivated in china as well as in many other countries as edible fish or as biological control agents for aquatic weeds. grass carp goes through a transition from carnivory to herbivory during its life cycle. grass carp smaller than 3 cm  is carnivorous, fish of 3- <dig>  cm  is at the food transition stage from zooplankton or benthos to aquatic macrophytes, whereas fish lager than  <dig>  cm  is herbivorous  <cit> . however, little is currently known about genes determining the food habit transition, and how they could achieve higher growth rates on plant materials, which have a relatively poor nutritional quality. therefore, grass carp is an excellent model for studying the formation mechanism of herbivory as it shows the food habit transition from carnivory to herbivory. it could facilitate the comparison analysis between carnivory and herbivory in one species, eliminating the differences result from different species.

grass carp is not able to synthesize cellulase enzyme, and its intestinal microbiota harbors many cellulose-decomposing bacteria  <cit> . the cellulase enzymes produced by cellulolytic bacteria and fungi are active in a wide range of invertebrate taxa  <cit> . however, relatively few higher vertebrates are able to utilize this resource efficiently  <cit> . moreover, our previous study suggests that the cellulase enzyme synthesized by certain microorganism is too limited to digest and absorb crude fiber sufficiently in grass carp, and exogenous cellulase needs to be added to the artificial diets, especially when using plant ingredients  <cit> . this agrees well with the results that digestion of fiber in grass carp is incomplete, with about half the food material ingested excreted as feces  <cit> . therefore, the food habit transition of grass carp might be not attributed to intestinal cellulose-decomposing bacteria, but rather due to high feeding rates. it has been reported that the daily ration  of grass carp may reach  <dig> % when feeding on aquatic plants  <cit> . cui et al.  <cit>  also found that grass carp fed with plant diet spend longer time on feeding, have higher feeding intensities, and consume less dry matter per bite than those fed with animal diet. grass carp fed with plant diet feed almost continuously for most of the diet cycle. in addition, our previous study reported that the gut length relative to body length in grass carp fed with duckweed is higher than those fed with chironomid larvae  <cit> , suggesting that gut growth could be also involved in the food habit transition.

to elucidate the relationship between gene expression and the formation of herbivory, we performed transcriptome sequencing of grass carp before and after the food habit transition from carnivory to herbivory. we showed that expression of genes in several pathways, including cell proliferation and differentiation, appetite control, circadian rhythm, and digestion and metabolism, were significantly different in fish before and after the food transition. these potential determinants provide a glimpse of genetic architecture of the formation of herbivory. elucidating the genes regulating the unique food habit transition from carnivory to herbivory in grass carp could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of higher intake and utilization of plant feedstuff in grass carp or other herbivores and formation of herbivore during speciation.

high-throughput sequencing and mapping
to obtain an overview of gene expression profile in grass carp before and after food habit transition, cdna libraries were constructed from brain , liver , gut  of grass carp before the food transition ); brain , liver , gut  of fish without transition ); brain , liver , gut  of fish after food transition ), and sequenced using the illumina hiseq <dig> system. after removing the low-quality reads, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads, respectively . about  <dig> - <dig> % of clean reads could be mapped to grass carp genome and  <dig> - <dig> % mapped to gene . most of the mapped reads were perfect match . the vast majority of all reads were mapped to unique positions except a very small percentage . to evaluate the quality of the transcriptomes, sequencing randomness assessment was performed to detect the random distribution of reads in reference genes. the distributions of reads from nine samples were homogeneous in grass carp genes, suggesting that the quality of our sequencing data was good. the distributions of genes’ coverage were shown by pie charts in the electronic supplementary material, additional file  <dig>  a large percentage of genes  showed perfect coverage . most of genes’ coverage  was higher than 50%. overall, high quality sequencing and mapping results were obtained. the sequencing data in this study have been deposited in the short read archive  at the national center for biotechnology information  .table  <dig>

alternative splicing and novel transcript predication
alternative splicing is essential for protein diversity and functional complexity  <cit> . we examined four major alternative splicing events of each group, including exon skipping, intron retention, alternative 5’ splicing and alternative 3’ splicing.  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  alternative splicing events were identified in groups a, b and c, respectively . as in other vertebrates, 5’- and 3’- alternative splicing is the major class accounting for about  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %  of all alternative splicing events in grass carp. because some genes produced two or more alternative splicing events, a total of  <dig>  genes  were estimated to undergo alternative splicing . we found the number of exon skipping, alternative 5’ splicing and alternative 3’ splicing in group c was higher than those in groups a and b, whereas the number of intron retention in group c was lower than those in groups a and b . we also found  <dig> food habit transition-specific alternative splicing genes, involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, appetite control, circadian rhythm, mitogen-activated protein kinases  signaling, adipocytokine, glutamatergic synapase, calcium signaling, gabaergic synapase, insulin signaling, peroxisome proliferator activated receptors  signaling, pancreatic secretion, protein digestion and absorption, bile secretion and gastric acid secretion pathways. we suggested that these genes with alternative splicing might play important roles in the food habit transition of grass carp through regulating diverse pathways .figure  <dig>

in addition, novel transcript could be determined by highthroughput sequencing to enrich the present genome database. we predicted  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  novel transcripts in ab, ag, al, bb, bg, bl, cb, cg and cl, respectively. of these about  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %  were longer than 500 bp. in all three tissues, more novel transcripts were identified in group a than in groups b and c, suggesting that novel transcripts were developmentally regulated.

identification of differentially expressed genes
we found  <dig>  genes to be differentially expressed between groups a and c,  <dig>  genes between groups a and b,  <dig>  genes between groups b and c; and  <dig>  genes to be differentially expressed between brain and gut,  <dig>  genes between brain and liver,  <dig>  genes between liver and gut  ≤  <dig> , fold-change ≥  <dig>  additional file 4). genes differentially expressed between groups a and c, but not differentially expressed between groups a and b were potentially involved in the food habit transition of grass carp. we mapped the differentially expressed genes to the reference canonical pathways in kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  to identify the biological pathways. the representative pathways with the differentially expressed genes were mapk signaling, adipocytokine, glutamatergic synapase, calcium signaling, gabaergic synapase, insulin signaling, ppar signaling, pancreatic secretion, protein digestion and absorption, bile secretion and gastric acid secretion and mammalian circadian rhythm pathways. analysis of these genes, which were differentially expressed between groups a and c, but not differentially expressed between groups a and b, revealed the signaling pathways involved, including cell proliferation and differentiation , epidermal growth factor receptor , fibroblast growth factor , fgf-binding protein  <dig> , insulin receptor a , insulin receptor substrate  <dig> , janus kinase , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , phosphatidylinositol- <dig> -bisphosphate 3-kinase , protein kinase c , suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig> ) ; appetite control , neuropeptide y receptor  <dig> , dopamine receptor d <dig> , gaba a receptor , leptin , cholecystokinin , insulin receptor a , insulin receptor substrate  <dig> , thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor  <dig> ) ; circadian rhythm , per <dig>  cryptochrome  <dig> , cry <dig>  clock protein , bmal <dig>  hepatic leukemia factor , class b basic helix-loop-helix protein , f-box and leucine-rich repeat protein  <dig> , nocturnin) .figure  <dig>

in addition, expression of genes involved in digestion and metabolism were significantly different between fish before and after food habit transition, including increase of hexokinase  and glucose-6-phosphatase  involved in glycolysis ; trypsin , pancreatic elastase , carboxypeptidase a , carboxypeptidase b , bile salt-stimulated lipase , secretory phospholipase a <dig>  involved in protein digestion ; solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig>  involved in protein metabolism and absorption ; microsomal epoxide hydrolase , solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig> , atp-binding cassette subfamily b  member  <dig>  involved in bile secretion ; solute carrier family  <dig> member  <dig>  and h+/k+-exchanging atpase alpha polypeptide  involved in gastric acid secretion ; carnitine o-palmitoyltransferase  <dig> , carnitine o-palmitoyltransferase  <dig> , sterol carrier protein  <dig> , acetyl-coa acyltransferase  <dig>  and long-chain acyl-coa synthetase  involved in fatty acid oxidation and transport .figure  <dig>

furthermore, the importance of the differentially expressed genes indicated above was further supported by the identification of significant alternative splicing in these genes. 56% of these differentially expressed genes had alternative splicing events. we also found that gene structure of these differentially expressed genes in grass carp were different from those in zebrafish, suggesting that the unique gene structure of grass carp might contribute to its unique food habit transition . we used real-time rt-pcr to confirm the important differential expression genes related to the food habit transition in grass carp. the data obtained were consistent with those obtained from the transcriptome sequencing and dge analysis .figure  <dig>

discussion
although grass carp is an ecologically appealing model of vertebrate herbivore, little is known about the genes and biological mechanisms of herbivory formation and food habit transition in grass carp. in this study, by profiling the transcriptomes of grass carp before and after food habit transition, we identified differentially expressed genes potentially influencing the food habit transition from carnivory to herbivory, including those affecting cell proliferation and differentiation, appetite control, circadian rhythm, and digestion and metabolism. real-time rt-pcr confirmed the differential expression in selected genes. gene structures of several differentially expressed genes in grass carp were different from those in zebrafish. we also found numerous alternative splicing and novel transcript related to the food habit transition of grass carp. these differences together might account for the formation of herbivore, and the higher intake and utilization of plant feedstuff in grass carp.

gut growth and differentially expressed genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, and digestion and metabolism
fish after food habit transition to herbivory  had significantly higher relative length of gut than fish before food habit transition  or those without food habit transition fed with chironomid larvae . it is suggested that longer gut could enable fish to achieve higher growth rates on plant materials, which have a relatively poor nutritional quality  <cit> . the digestive system plays an essential role in vertebrate physiology as the site of nutrient digestion and absorption  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that the time of exposure of ingested food to proteolytic enzymes rises with increasing gut length in herbivorous fish, therefore many herbivorous fish have long coiled digestive tract  <cit> . furthermore, we observed higher expression of several growth factors, their receptors and downstream signaling molecular involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in group c, including ghrb, egfr, fgf, fgfbp <dig>  insra, irs <dig>  jak, stat, pi3k, pkc  <cit> . previous study has reported that exogenous growth hormone stimulates structural and functional intestinal adaptation in rats  <cit> . gh receptors are present throughout the human gastrointestinal tract  <cit>  and transgenic mice that overexpressed gh have higher total body weights and heavier small intestines than the control  mice  <cit> . the intestinal egf and egfr are involved in the processes of gastrointestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration  <cit> . fibroblast growth factors have also been implicated in proliferation regulation in the gut  <cit> . our results suggested that the up-regulation of these genes in grass carp after food transition might lead to increased cell proliferation and differentiation, contributing to the gut growth, food habit transition from carnivory to herbivory, and increase of intake and utilization of plant feedstuff in grass carp .

in addition, several genes involved in digestion and metabolism were significantly increased in grass carp after food habit transition, including prss, cela, cpa, cpb, cel, pla <dig> involved in protein digestion  <cit> ; eaat <dig>  asct <dig>  b0at <dig>  b <dig> +at <dig>  tat <dig>  y+lat <dig> involved in protein metabolism and absorption  <cit> ; meh, oats, bsep involved in bile secretion  <cit> ; ae and h/k-atpase involved in gastric acid secretion  <cit> ; gk and g6pc involved in glycolysis; cpt- <dig>  cpt- <dig>  scp-x, thiolase b and acs involved in fatty acid oxidation and transport  <cit>  . it is suggested that longer gut could enable fish after the food transition to achieve higher growth rates on plant materials through increased digestion and metabolism, such as better protein digestion with increased prss, cela and cpa expressions, better food digestion with enhanced bile and gastric acid secretion, and better protein absorption with improved amino acid transportation.

differentially expressed genes involved in appetite control
in the present study, grass carp had free access to food 24 h a day. fish fed with low nutritional plant diets  had higher growth than those fed with high nutritional animal diets , therefore grass carp after food habit transition to herbivory could consume more food per day. previous studies provide a framework for understanding the regulation of food intake in mammals and fish. peripheral signals such as leptin from adipocytes, insulin from endocrine pancreas, cholecystokinin and peptide yy from gastrointestinal tract are incorporated in the hypothalamus to generate orexigenic  or anorexigenic  signals  <cit> . we observed higher expression of orexigenic genes , and lower expression of anorexigenic genes  in brain of grass carp in group c than those in group a. moreover, the expression of anorexigenic genes  were increased in liver or gut of grass carp in group c compared to those in group a . these genes are well-established regulators of energy homeostasis and play important roles in determination of food intake  <cit> . the changes in gene expression suggested that grass carp after food habit transition to herbivory had increased appetite signal in brain. this agrees well with the results obtained in grass carp fed with plant food that appears to feed throughout the diet cycle  <cit> . this foraging strategy may represent an adaptation to herbivory and enable the grass carp to achieve high growth rates on plant materials.

cck is released from the duodenum in response to the presence of digested food  <cit> , potentially explaining the increased expression in fish after food habit transition. in addition, leptin appears to be a growth factor for normal small intestine  <cit> , and the increased expression of leptin in liver might stimulate the gut growth of grass carp after food transition. herbivorous fish consume more food per day and have much longer gut than carnivorous and omnivorous fish  <cit> . our previous study on food preference of mandarin fish, a piscivore, showed that dead prey fish feeders have decreased appetite  <cit> , suggesting that the appetite control pathway plays an important role in food habit formation of fish. in addition, several genes involved in glutamategic synapase, calcium signaling and gabaergic synapase pathway, such as eaat, gad, nmdar, pkc, pla <dig>  mglur <dig>  pka and nos  <cit> , were increased in grass carp after food habit transition, which might contribute to its higher appetite.

differentially expressed genes involved in circadian rhythm
previous studies demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythm generation in zebrafish appear to be generally consistent with the mammalian model  <cit> . we identified homologs of the mammalian clock genes in grass carp. we found differential expression in several clock genes, including per <dig>  per <dig>  cry, clock, bmal <dig>  pdp, dec, fbxl <dig>  nocturnin between fish before and after food transition . these genes are known to be critical regulators of circadian rhythm  <cit> , with the heterodimerization of clock and bmal <dig> proteins activating transcription of period and cryptochrome genes. the per and cry proteins form complexes that enter the nucleus, bind to the clock:bmal <dig> complex and inhibit transcription. the disruption of these genes could cause the reset of behavioral rhythmicity. grass carp fed with plant diet spent longer time on feeding, and feed almost continuously for most of the diet cycle  <cit> . taken together, changes in expression levels of these clock genes in grass carp might reset circadian phase of feeding to accommodate the food habit transition from carnivory to herbivory, because fish fed with plant diet consumes less dry matter per bite than those fed with animal diet. this result agrees with our previous research in mandarin fish, with the acquisition of novel food preference  partly due to resetting of circadian phase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results showed that grass carp after food habit transition from carnivory to herbivory had higher relative length of gut than those before transition and without transition. the food habit transition in grass carp might be due to enhanced gut growth, increased appetite, resetting of circadian phase and enhanced digestion and metabolism. interaction of expression and alternative splicing in genes related to cell proliferation and differentiation, appetite control, circadian rhythm outputs, and digestion and metabolism might drive the formation of herbivory in grass carp.
