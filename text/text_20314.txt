BACKGROUND
this article has been published as a correction for  <cit> .

micrornas  are small  non-coding rnas that play important roles in the regulation of various cellular processes by inhibiting gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . many mirnas interact with target mrnas, leading to degradation or sequestration from the translational apparatus  <cit> ; some mirnas target other non-coding transcripts and are required for the generation of trans-acting small interfering rnas   <cit> . mirnas have been implicated in the regulation of key developmental, stress response and other physiological processes. while in animals many mirnas are derived from introns or untranslated regions of coding messages, plant mirnas are typically specified by dedicated mir genes. these genes are, at least for the most part, transcribed by rna polymerase ii to yield capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts   <cit> . the rnase iii enzyme dicer-like- <dig>  mediates the specific excision of mature mirnas from the pri-mirna via the initial generation of imperfect hairpin precursors  and the subsequent excision of a duplex consisting of the mature microrna and its complementary region   <cit> . most, if not all plant mirnas then undergo methylation of the 2' hydroxyl group at the 3' ends of this duplex  <cit>  and are subsequently exported to the cytosol, where one strand, the mature mirna, is selectively incorporated into the rna induced silencing complex  which mediates interactions with target mrnas  <cit> .

the same, or highly similar mature mirnas are often specified by different genomic loci within a species, and many, but by no means all, mirnas show broad phylogenetic conservation - similar mirnas are grouped into families. several computational methods have been developed to identify putative pre-mirnas by evaluating the capacity of the genomic context of sequences similar to known mature mirnas to form hairpin structures exhibiting structural and thermodynamic features consistent with known pre-mirnas . purely ab-initio approaches to the prediction of non-conserved  mirnas have also yielded some notable successes , although such approaches are often plagued by an excess of false positive results. the most reliable method to identify putative novel pre-mirnas remains the sequencing of small rna fractions  <cit>  coupled with the identification of plausible hairpin structures in flanking genomic sequences .

once mature mirna sequences have been identified, their expression in different tissues, developmental stages or environmental conditions can be studied through experimental approaches such as northern blotting, oligonucleotide arrays or deep-sequencing of isolated small rna fractions. however, the fact that identical or highly similar mature mirnas can derive from multiple loci within a single genome limits the capacity of such approaches to determine which genomic precursor loci are truly expressed.

meaningful insight into the regulation of mirna expression at the transcriptional and other levels is undoubtedly desirable in the context of post-genomic and systems biology initiatives. however, large scale and in-silico studies of the regulation of transcription of mirnas require accurate definition of primary transcript coordinates on a genomic sequence, or at the very least, fairly accurate estimates of transcriptional start sites. owing to their typically short physiological half-life, relatively few pri-mirnas have been found in est and large-scale full-length cdna sequencing projects in plants. for the same reasons, manual cloning and characterization of primary mirnas is a laborious process, and has been performed for relatively few plant mirnas  <cit> .

to date, large-scale analysis of expression of plant mirnas and associated prediction of precursor sequences have been restricted to relatively few species and the paucity of complete plant genome sequences limits the possibilities for studies incorporating extensive genomic information. the recently published genome sequence of the grapevine   <cit>  provides the first opportunity to study the potential roles of mirnas in fruit maturation and other physiological processes of a commercially important species in the context of a complete genome sequence.

we have previously used comparative methods to predict  <dig> putative pre-mirnas  in the grapevine genome  <cit> . here we present experimental validation of a large number of these predictions using several high throughput methodologies. oligonucleotide arrays reveal that several of these families show significant changes in expression levels in different tissues and during fruit maturation. small rna deep-sequencing allowed the precise definition of boundaries of mature mirna sequences where comparative predictions left some ambiguity. additionally, we demonstrate that deep sequencing of the polya+ transcriptome permits the precise identification of which candidate precursors are expressed in different tissues and shows that, in many cases, fairly precise estimates of primary transcript coordinates may be inferred from such data. finally, we show that patterns of splicing and alternative splicing of pri-mirnas may be elucidated from whole transcriptome deep sequencing data and confirm that a significant proportion of grapevine pri-mirnas are subjected to such processes, consistent with the suggestion that post-transcriptional regulation might play a widespread role in the regulation of plant mirna maturation.

RESULTS
in the previous description of  <dig>  fold coverage assembly of the grapevine  genome  <cit>  we identified  <dig> candidate conserved mirnas. here we present a comprehensive characterization of conserved mirnas in grapevine including a refinement of mature mirna sequences and important information regarding pattern of expression of both mature mirnas and precursors. three complementary approaches were followed to characterize the expression pattern of both the mature mirnas and their precursors. to allow a comparison between methods, all technologies were applied to leaf tissue. whole transcriptome deep sequencing was performed on all tissues available from the highly homozygote sequenced clone pn <dig>  to maximize the coverage of tissues studied, microarray and  <dig> transcriptomic analyses were performed on berries - organs of particular agronomic importance - from other clones as they cannot be easily obtained from the very weak pn <dig> clone.

comparative prediction of microrna precursors
we previously used the microharvester software  <cit>  with all plant mirnas present in release  <dig>  of mirbase  <cit>  to identify  <dig> candidate conserved mirnas and their precursors in the  <dig>  fold coverage assembly of the genome of the grapevine   <cit> . manual refinement of these predictions provided  <dig> high-confidence candidate pre-mirnas classified in  <dig> conserved families .

for the most part, we confirm existing patterns of mirna family conservation with respect to completely sequenced plant genomes for which extensive analyses of mirnas have been performed . of the  <dig> families for which we identified putative precursor sequences in vitis vinifera ,  <dig> are represented in all four of these species and a further  <dig> have been characterized in all three magnoliophytes. one family  is present in both of the previously sequenced dicots, while two previously arabidopsis-specific families  were predicted in grapevine , while mir <dig> and mir <dig>  are likely to have evolved in a common ancestor of these organisms after its divergence from the arabidopsis lineage  <cit> . mir <dig> precursors have been characterized only in poplar, grapevine and p. patens, while a series of mir <dig> precursors represent the first members of this family to be identified in core eudicots, having been identified only in p. patens, rice and more recently in the california poppy   <cit> . the only families tested for which members have been identified in poplar and at least one other of the aforementioned genomes but for which microharvester failed to identify candidate precursors in the grapevine genome were mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> 

with respect to the reference annotation of protein coding genes in the vitis vinifera genome,  <dig> putative pre-mirnas were intergenic in location . four precursor predictions fell within or overlapped annotated coding or utr exons although homology searches and transcriptomics data generated subsequently to the initial annotations call into question the validity of all but two of these exon annotations. mirna  <dig> h is probably an incorrect prediction derived from a coincidentally plausible hairpin structure formed by the opposite strand to the presumed target  box gene). a similar situation is observed for mir171g which falls on the opposite strand to to a gras domain transcription factor gene. nine precursor predictions were apparently intronic in location. manual checks of the automated annotations suggested that all of the introns putatively containing pre-mirnas were likely to be erroneous predictions, being atypically long  and interrupting putative retroelement derived genes or obvious fusion gene predictions .

deep sequencing of small rnas from grapevine leaf tissue
we generated  <dig> , <dig> reads with illumina sequencing of small rna isolated from vitis vinifera l. clone pn <dig> leaves.  <dig> , <dig> individual small rna reads of 18- <dig> bases  yielded at least one perfect match to the draft genome after removal of adapter sequences and allowing for post transcriptional oligoadenylation of reads. after exclusion of reads mapping to annotated structural rnas, over 7% of the total mapped sequences were of length  <dig> bases and accounted for  <dig> % of the genomic loci represented by the mapped data . 15% of loci represented were of length  <dig>  with a mean redundancy of  <dig>  reads/locus, suggesting, in accord with other studies  <cit> , that mirnas in our sample tend to be expressed at higher levels or processed more specifically than the more heterogeneous  <dig> base small rnas.

mapping of the short tags onto the genome sequence revealed that of the  <dig> families predicted by our comparative analysis,  <dig> showed at least one sequence tag either in exact or very close correspondence to the position of one of the predicted mature sequences . in some cases, the most commonly observed sequences were identical to the predicted mature sequences while for other families, the predominant mature mirna sequenced exhibited small variations  with respect to the predicted mature sequences. this finding was not unexpected given the variation in mature mirna lengths within families observed in other plant species and the nature of the comparative method used to generate the initial predictions. for predicted precursors for which matching small rna reads were recovered, the vast majority of reads conform to the sequences indicated in table  <dig> , consistent with the primary requirement for the annotation of plant mirna sequences  <cit> .

for each predicted pre-mirna the table reports: the mature sequence, the number of perfect matching or oligoadenylated short rna reads observed in leaf, asterisks indicate that corresponding mirna* sequences were also recovered by deep sequencing , tissues in which significant expression of the precursor was observed by illumina whole transcriptome sequencing , the presence of  <dig> reads including the precursor sequence in leaf , and tissues where the combimatrix oligoarray showed significant expression of the mature sequence . asterisks indicate signal detected for precursor in that tissue. mature mirnas are ordered to reflect expected cases of crosshybridization for oligonucleotide arrays. for all micrornas, chromosome, strand and coordinates of the precursor mirna are provided .

we recovered a number of reads that include an additional 3' base that does not correspond to any genomic locus, this tendency has been observed in other species . furthermore, a low but notable proportion of mapped small rna sequences show mismatches to the genomic sequence while preferentially mapping only to putative mirna precursor loci. this is probably due to errors in sequencing or during reverse transcription or amplification and particularly to the higher error rate of the illumina sequencing strategy in gc rich sequences  <cit> . during the course of these analyses it became clear that two precursors  were likely to derive from the opposite strand from that initially predicted. where appropriate, corrected mature sequences have been deposited in mirbase.

due to identity or similarity among mature mirnas belonging to the same family, deep sequencing of small rnas does not allow consistent unambiguous assignment of mature mirnas to their genomic loci of origin. nevertheless our analysis provided indications of the presence and relative abundance of  <dig> distinct mature mirnas from conserved families in leaves - corresponding to up to  <dig> distinct precursor loci .

oligonucleotide arrays
a  <dig> k combimatrix custom array was developed to validate our in-silico mirna predictions and to profile mirnas expression in different tissues.

slides were hybridized with low molecular weight rna , extracted from six grapevine  tissues: ripening berries , roots, leaves and young inflorescences. each hybridization and lmw-rna extraction was performed twice.

in addition to the mature mirna sequences, the probe set included probes shifted  <dig> or  <dig> bases 3' or 5' with respect to the central base of the corresponding mature mirnas as well as probes derived from regions of the stem not predicted to overlap with the mature mirna sequence and controls containing maximally destabilizing substitutions with respect to probe sequences . except for probes shifted  <dig> nucleotides towards the 5' end of the mirna precursor, for more than 90% of the probes a signal drop-off greater than 90% was observed - indicating no significant hybridization for these probes occurred. on the contrary, for probes shifted  <dig> nucleotide towards the 5' end of the mirna precursor the lack of signal drop-off might be due to the fact that probes were synthesized with their 3' termini towards the slide, and that no "spacer" oligonucleotide was used . as a consequence, steric effects might reduce the specificity determined by the 3'-most five bases of the probes.

other than for  <dig> out of  <dig> pre-mirnas , no detectable signals were recorded for the probes designed on the precursor loop regions - likely due to size fractionation of rna samples and the relatively short half-life of pre-mirnas. we conclude that our mirna expression data are principally derived from mature mirnas molecules, without appreciable pre-mirna contamination.

finally, it should be noted that recent studies have demonstrated appreciable levels of cross-hybridization between closely related mirnas and probes differing by only one or two bases  <cit> . it is therefore difficult to exclude the possibility that cross-hybridization within mirna families causes a distortion of quantitative estimates of expression levels of some individual mature mirna sequences.

microarray analysis of mirna expression
of the mature mirna sequences considered,  <dig> , showed significant expression in at least one tissue tested , and another  <dig> showed a borderline signal. specifically,  <dig> different mirnas showed significant signal in roots,  <dig> in leaves,  <dig> in young inflorescences,  <dig> in green berries,  <dig> in berries at veraison  and  <dig> in mature berries.

to evaluate the statistical significance of the differential expression of mature mirnas in the six tissue considered, we set up two distinct comparisons: one among the three developmental stages of the ripening berries and the other one among leaves, roots and inflorescences. anova analyses were performed with a p-value threshold of  <dig>  and subsequently a scheffè test was used to assess which of the three tissues showed significant differences. thirteen different mature mirnas showed a statistically significant change in signal between the ripening stages of the berry , and  <dig> mirnas showed significant changes in their expression when comparing three different tissues . mir395a and mir171h show a distinctive pattern of expression - being highly expressed at veraison with respect to the other two stages  . seven mirnas  are more expressed in mature berries than in green berries . four mirnas  are, on the contrary, more expressed in green berries, their expression decreasing during ripening .

clear patterns also emerge from analyses of differential expression between roots, leaves and young inflorescences. thirteen mirnas are significantly differentially expressed in roots, showing a similar expression in the other tissues. in particular mir397a, mir398b and mir <dig> all show at least  <dig> fold higher expression in root than either leaf or early inflorescences, while mir159a, mir160a, mir399a, mir399b, mir403a and mir <dig> show more modest, but still significant, changes in the same comparisons . on the contrary mir164a, mir164b, mir171c and mir172c show a significantly lower level of expression in roots .

five mirnas  yield significantly higher signals in young inflorescences than both leaves and roots . only one mirna, mir160c, shows a leaf-specific expression profile  . finally, six mirnas  exhibit significant differences in expression levels in all comparisons between leaf, root and inflorescences . five of these mirnas  show the highest expression in young inflorescences and the lowest in roots.

following the widespread assumption that many mirna/target interactions are conserved between related species  <cit> , our data regarding differential expression of mature mirna sequences raise some intriguing possibilities particularly with respect to the potential importance of mirna in the regulation of fruit maturation.

li et al.  <cit>  recently showed that the transcription factor nfya <dig> is targeted by mir <dig> and that overexpression of mir <dig> leads to excessive water loss through leaves and hypersensitivity to drought stress in a. thaliana. in this light, the preponderance of mir <dig> family members in the group of mirnas upregulated in mature berries is striking and might reflect a mechanism to protect maturing fruit from dehydration. we also note that mir <dig> family, identified so far only in o. sativa and p. patens  <cit>  is upregulated during berry maturation. this is a first indication of a possible function of mir <dig> for which no information was previously available. mir396c shows  <dig> fold decrease in expression during ripening. the mir <dig> family targets seven growth regulating factor  genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . grf genes encode putative transcription factors associated with cell expansion in leaf and other tissues in a. thaliana and o. sativa  <cit> . a potential role for mir <dig> in the regulation of cell expansion during fruit maturation is an intriguing hypothesis. in addition, recent data also link mir <dig> to responses to abiotic stresses including drought  <cit> , again suggesting the importance of water homeostasis during berry ripening. mir <dig>  downregulated during berry maturation, targets apetala  <dig>  -like transcription factors, regulators of flowering time, organ identity and of vegetative phase change  <cit> . in grapevine, genes related to ap <dig> are upregulated at veraison, being involved in berry maturation  <cit>  and putatively connected with abiotic and biotic stress resistance. this evidence fits well with our findings. the sharp up-regulation of mir <dig> at veraison suggests a further role for mirnas in an agronomically important aspect of grape maturation. mir <dig> is known to contribute to the regulation of sulfur metabolism, targeting both sulfate transporters and atp sulphurylase genes. a direct connection between atp sulfurylases and berry maturation has not been demonstrated, but it is known that a glutathione s-transferase is strongly connected with berry ripening and in particular with coloration during berry development  <cit> .

mir397a, mir398b and mir <dig> which are extremely highly expressed in root tissues target various copper proteins: plantacyanin, laccases and a superoxide dismutase, all putatively involved in stress responses and lignification  <cit> . these mirnas have also been shown to be coexpressed in arabidopsis under conditions of copper deprivation  <cit> . moreover some laccase genes in arabidopsis are root specific  or mostly expressed in roots  <cit>  and are involved in root elongation and lignification  <cit> . given that grapevine roots are much more lignified than those of arabidopsis, it is plausible that regulation of laccase expression is vital in the grapevine. it is interesting to note that the laccase family is, along with other polyphenol oxidase gene families, massively expanded in grapevine with respect to arabidopsis .

whole transcriptome sequencing and differential expression of precursors
the majority of plant mirna genes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii and result in the production of polyadenylated primary transcripts  <cit> . a strict correlation between expression levels of individual precursors and levels of mature mirnas should not be expected. mature mirnas are likely to be, in general, more stable than their corresponding primary transcripts and may derive from more than one genomic locus. furthermore, recent data in plants  <cit>  and animals  <cit>  suggest that a variety of mechanisms, including alternative splicing and the specific binding of protein factors, can regulate the efficiency with which pri- or pre-mirnas are processed. high levels of primary transcript can thus be associated with low levels of mature mirnas and vice-versa. these considerations notwithstanding, it is reasonable to presume that sequences derived from highly expressed pri-mirna transcripts should be represented in whole transcriptome "deep sequencing" experiments.

to investigate this hypothesis, we have analyzed whole polya+ transcriptome data generated with the illumina solexa technology  <cit>  and roche  <dig> next generation sequencing platforms.

a total of  <dig> , <dig> illumina sequences  derived from polya+ rna isolated from  <dig> tissues , in vitro cultivated juvenile stem , in vitro cultivated juvenile root  and embryonic callus  were mapped to the grapevine genome and coordinates compared to those for predicted pre-mirnas.

the statistical significance of the number of reads mapping within a predicted pre-mirna was evaluated  and  <dig> predicted precursors show significant expression in at least one tissue . many predicted precursors show a wide expression . in some families, when expressed, precursors show overlapping patterns. for example, mir319c, mir319e and mir319f are all expressed in stem, while mir319c and mir319g are expressed in callus, no expression of mir <dig> was detected in leaf or root. a similar situation is observed for the mir <dig> family. in other cases, different precursors seem to be predominantly expressed in different tissues. for example mir171e transcripts are detected only in callus, mir171f is only transcribed in stem while mir171g is observed in callus and root - a similar situation can be observed for several families including mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir169). these data suggest that tissue specific expression of different precursors within single families is widespread in the grapevine.

 <dig> sequencing generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads respectively from leaf and berry polya+ rna. the expression of  <dig> unique predicted precursor sequences received ulterior support from these data . with the exception of mir160b and the mir <dig> family the expression of all precursors detected by  <dig> sequencing in leaf was also strongly supported by illumina data. interestingly, given the lack of detectable expression of the mature sequence in leaf or berry, mir <dig> precursors were detected at high levels both by illumina and  <dig> sequencing, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of processing of this transcript.

estimation of primary microrna transcripts and splice sites
for a number of predicted micrornas the density of coverage of the corresponding genomic loci was sufficient to attempt to estimate primary transcript coordinates as well as patterns of splicing and alternative splicing.

we constructed position specific scoring matrices  of experimentally validated grapevine canonical splice donor and acceptor contexts  and used these matrices to evaluate all possible canonical splice donors and acceptors from  <dig> kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of predicted microrna precursors showing extensive coverage by illumina rna-seq reads. the positions and flanking exonic sequences of all possible splice donor/acceptor pairs were used to combinatorially generate possible splice junctions. rna-seq reads which did not map perfectly to the genome sequence were compared to these computationally generated splice junctions and pairs providing perfect matches  were recorded along with the tissue distribution of reads supporting each splice event. additionally, for each supported splice event, we recorded the ratio of base coverage by rna-seq of the flanking  <dig> putatively exonic bases and the coverage of flanking  <dig> putatively intronic bases . three fold greater coverage of exonic regions was considered as additional support for the presence of a functional splice junction. introns inferred from mapping of  <dig> transcriptome reads were also recorded.

visual examination of rna-seq coverage of regions upstream and downstream of mirna precursor loci was used to provide initial estimates of transcript start and end positions. this step was complicated by the known propensity of rna-seq to provide uneven coverage of transcript termini - presumably due to the dynamics the nebulization step in sample preparation and to issues associated with differential recovery of fragments during sample preparation. accordingly, we subjected the  <dig> kb interval centered on predicted precursors to promoter prediction analysis by tssp-tcm  <cit>  in order to attempt to provide support for manually identified transcription start sites. estimated transcript coordinates, putative intron coordinates quality scores for each donor/acceptor, frequencies of splice junction-covering reads, and tss proposed by tssp-tcm are reported in additional file 1: supplemental table s <dig> 

the mir <dig> precursor  is of particular interest in that it covers a region including several potential canonical introns that are supported by multiple illumina and  <dig> reads. all tissues indicate that the transcriptional start site falls between positions  <dig> , <dig> -  <dig> , <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  the postulated canonical introns imply alternative splicing of the nascent primary transcript from this locus, as does the coverage of the region by  <dig> contigs . several of these introns, and the alternative splicing of this transcript were also supported by preliminary race experiments . indeed, while the boundaries of proposed introns correspond to "shoulders" of falling transcript coverage, significant levels of reads mapping within the introns are observed. interestingly, hirsch et al.  <cit>  recently demonstrated that the primary mir162a transcript of arabidopsis is subjected to complex pattern of alternative splicing, similar to that proposed for the grapevine mir <dig> transcript. in arabidopsis, only unspliced isoforms are capable of yielding mature mirnas. our findings therefore suggest conservation of alternative splicing as a key regulatory mechanism in mir <dig> expression and indicate that illumina and  <dig> transcript data can also be used to identify alternatively spliced plant pri-mirnas.

of  <dig> precursor loci chosen on the basis of extensive rna-seq coverage ,  <dig> showed evidence of transcript splicing and  <dig> of alternative splicing, suggesting that post-transcriptional modification of mirna transcripts is likely to be widespread. it is possible that some splicing events frequently identified by deep sequencing approaches could be associated with regulation of downstream processing of transcripts as has been shown for the mir <dig> transcript of arabidopsis  <cit> . for mir <dig> and mir <dig>  this hypothesis might be consistent with the low levels of mature microrna observed by deep-sequencing, in contrast to the apparently high spliced transcript levels. for several pre/pri-mirna loci  we infer several closely related canonical introns . we speculate that this phenomenon might be due, in part, to the incapacity of the nonsense mediated decay pathway . thus, evidence of transcription of intergenic pre-mirnas can reasonably be considered as validation of transcription of the precursor.

the finding that relative depth of coverage of different regions of primary transcripts is consistent between tissues suggest the presence of systematic biases in either the procedure used to fragment the cdna, in amplification of fragments for sequencing, or in sequencing efficiency. dohm et al.  <cit>  observed a strong relationship between local gc content and depth of coverage with illumina genome resequencing. indeed, we observe a relationship between local gc content and depth of coverage - even within regions that show contiguous coverage and are unlikely to represent introns . however, grapevine introns between both coding and non-coding exons show a low gc content  with respect to coding and non-coding exons   <cit> . thus, it may be difficult to differentiate between introns and regions where low coverage is a result of low gc content in exonic regions on the basis of illumina transcriptome data - particularly where levels of template are likely to be low and a-priori gene models are not available. however, the discovery that putative splice junctions for pri-mirnas can be identified by discontiguous mapping of illumina reads may help to ameliorate this problem for plant pri-mirnas. the fact that we recovered evidence of alternative splicing of mir <dig>  is consistent with data from a. thaliana  <cit>  and validates our basic approach. indeed, other putative pri-mirnas, including mir394b show evidence of splicing from both transcript coverage and discontiguous mapping of whole transcriptome reads.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used a combination of high throughput approaches to show highly tissue specific expression of mature mirnas in the grapevine vitis vinifera including the first evidence of differential expression of mirnas during fruit maturation in this species. we have shown that, for plants at least, whole transcriptome sequence data can be applied to the detection of differential transcription of putative precursor mirna loci and to the detection and definition of pri-mirnas as well as to the tentative definition of patterns of splicing in such precursors. it is probable that similar analyses performed in lines carrying mutations in genes involved in mirna processing  will allow more extensive and accurate definition of mirna transcripts on a large scale, eventually facilitating detailed analyses of promoter sequences and a deeper understanding of mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of mirna genes. our analyses also suggest that splicing  of pri-mirnas may be widespread and might constitute a general mechanism for the regulation of mirnas.
