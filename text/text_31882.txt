BACKGROUND
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  o157:h <dig> is a food- and waterborne human pathogen that causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis , or in more severe cases hemolytic uremic syndrome   <cit> . cattle are the primary reservoir of this pathogen and may be asymptomatically colonized  <cit> . due to the serious disease and its low-infectious dose  <cit> , e. coli o157:h <dig> is considered an adulterant in non-intact raw beef products in the united states. shiga toxin  is one of the major virulence factors involved in e. coli o157:h <dig> pathogenesis  <cit> ; based on immunoreactivity, toxins are classified as either stx <dig> or stx <dig>  <cit> . dna sequence diversity further divides stx <dig> into  <dig> allelic types   <cit>  with stx2a and stx2c most frequently associated with hus  <cit> . during the stepwise evolution of e. coli o157:h <dig> from a common e. coli o55:h <dig> ancestor, genes encoding stx <dig> and stx <dig> were acquired horizontally by phage transduction  <cit> . in this established model, the stx2-converting phage was acquired before the antigenic shift from o <dig> to o <dig>  followed by stx1-converting phage acquisition. follow-up studies refined this model  <cit>  and most recently, lacher et al.  <cit>  proposed a model taking into consideration acquisition and loss of stx1-, stx2a-, and stx2c-converting phage, and additional mutations that define e. coli o157:h <dig> sub-lineages. genetic characterization together with clinical data has identified that two groups, designated clade  <dig> and clade  <dig>  are more commonly associated with severe disease than are isolates from other clades  <cit> .

the lambdoid stx-converting phages are temperate, exhibiting both lytic and lysogenic life cycles  <cit> . the lysogen-lytic switch is directed by several regulatory proteins including ci, cii, ciii, cro, n, and q, the latter of which activates transcription from the late promoter, pr’. the genes encoding stx <dig> are positioned downstream of pr’  <cit> , and dna damaging agents that activate lytic replication also increase toxin production  <cit> . previous genomic analyses  <cit>  demonstrated that dna sequence variation between stx2-converting phages occurs particularly within the regulatory regions, leading to the hypothesis that differences in the kinetics and abundance of prophage induction may be responsible for the variations in stx <dig> production observed between different e. coli o157:h <dig> strains  <cit> . this is supported by the observation that the e. coli o157:h <dig> q allele designated q <dig> is a marker of high stx2a producing strains  <cit> , although this has not been seen in other isolate collections  <cit> . other factors impacting toxin production include the presence of insertion sequences   within the phage genomes, and ci repressors encoded within other prophage  <cit> .

in previous publications we characterized  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> isolates from patients in pennsylvania  <cit>  and sequenced the genome of three isolates  <cit> . while the whole-genome sequence  data provided valuable information concerning strain diversity, the stx-converting phage genomes, critical for understanding toxin production, could not be fully assembled. factors contributing to this include the short read technology used, and the high sequence identity with other lambdoid phages; e.g.  <dig> out of  <dig> prophages in e. coli o157:h <dig> sakai are classified as lambdoid  <cit> . the objectives of the present work were to isolate and sequence stx2a-converting phages from a diverse set of e. coli o157:h <dig> strains, and to compare these phage genomes to those previously sequenced; the identification of identical phage within different e. coli o157:h <dig> hosts also allowed us to test whether factors encoded outside of the phage genome impact stx <dig> production.

RESULTS
phage genome assemblies
to enrich phage dna , e. coli o157:h <dig> strains were induced by ciprofloxacin and total phdna was isolated. for  <dig> of the  <dig> strains, sufficient dsdna  was obtained for  <dig> sequencing, and assembly resulted in complete stx2a-converting phage genomes ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp . in addition, two  <dig>  bp phage genomes unrelated to stx2a-converting phage and inserted at yicc, yielded enough read coverage for complete phage assembly.table  <dig> genome size, genomic insertion site, is <dig> copy number, and host strain for the nine phage sequence types  defined in this study

twenty-two stx2a-converting phage genomes form three genetic clusters
predicted phage proteomes were compared with large scale blast score ratio   <cit> . applying hierarchical average linkage clustering algorithm, which is part of mev v. <dig>   <cit> , on this proteomic matrix   <cit>  identified three distinct phage clusters, designated as phage sequence type  <dig> , pst <dig> and pst <dig> . these three clusters were also apparent within a whole genome alignment . the  <dig> genomes classified as pst <dig> were further divided into six subtypes  by assessing is <dig> copy number and insertion sites . pst1- <dig> contained  <dig> phage genomes that each have is <dig> inserted at the same position , splitting a predicted phage protein into two predicted proteins . this insertion sequence is located downstream of the stx <dig> gene. genome sequences of the 62 kb pst1- <dig> phage differed at most by five snps, and these snp level differences were observed within the predicted or <dig> operator, portal protein, tail fiber, and several hypothetical proteins . all pst1- <dig> isolates carry the stx2a-converting prophage found in the prototypical strain e. coli o157:h <dig> sakai  <cit> . the two phages in pst1- <dig> were 100 % identical on the nucleotide level, and psts 1– <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig> each represent single phage found in strains pa <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig>  and pa <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> nine phage sequence types  form three clusters when compared at the proteomic level. de novo gene prediction with prodigal was used to have consistent orf prediction prior to tblastn analysis. resulting ls-bsr values were clustered by average linkage hierarchical clustering resulting in three distinct main phage clusters . five proteins were highly conserved in pst <dig>   <dig> in pst <dig> and  <dig> in pst <dig>  and almost 50 % of proteins are conserved in all phages. the ls-bsr for each orf identifies unique , divergent  and common proteins   <cit> 

fig.  <dig> is <dig> is responsible for most diversity observed within  pst <dig> and  pst <dig> clusters. blast comparisons of phage genomes were visualized using easyfig  <cit> . blue shaded regions connect homologous sequences and orange shaded regions connect reverse complemented homologous sequences. arrows represent orfs. dark pink and green arrows designate the location of stx2a and is <dig>  respectively



we found that all pst <dig> cluster phages inserted within wrba, which encodes a trpr binding protein, while both the pst <dig> and pst <dig> cluster phages were inserted within the trna argw . the int sequences were identical for the pst <dig> and pst <dig> cluster phages. however, these were clearly of different evolutionary origin or have substantially diverged from int encoded within pst <dig> cluster phage, as neither the dna nor the deduced amino acid sequences could be aligned using blast  <cit> . a correlation between int sequences and insertion site has been noted before  <cit> .

is <dig> insertion and position is a main driver of genetic variation observed within pst <dig> and pst <dig> clusters
genomes from the pst <dig> phage cluster ranged in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp . is <dig> copy numbers, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , accounted for most of this difference. the insertion site and orientation of is <dig> varied as well . for instance, for psts 1– <dig> and 1– <dig>  the transposon inserted at position  <dig> , interrupting the gene for a putative dna-binding protein roi. is <dig> also inserted at position  <dig>  in pst1- <dig>  interrupting a putative lysozyme, and at position  <dig> in pst2- <dig>  interrupting a putative adenine dna methyltransferase. in pst2- <dig>  the insertion was found at position  <dig>  within an intergenic region .

phage early regulatory and replication regions differed among the three clusters
we next performed a global alignment of representative phage genomes from pst <dig>  pst <dig>  and pst <dig> . most differences were observed within regions predicted to encode the phages’ early regulatory and replication genes. for example, ci  and cro  only shared  <dig> – <dig>  % amino acid sequence identity over the full gene length among the three clusters . homologs that were distantly related by amino acid identity could still be identified by their shared patterns defined in the clusters of orthologous groups database  <cit> . predicted operator sequences  <cit>  were identified between ci and cro  and between ci and n  in genomes of the pst <dig> and pst <dig> cluster . we could not identify putative operator sequences or homologs to the early regulatory genes ciii and cii in the pst <dig> cluster, but instead a type ii restriction/modification enzyme system  was found at the corresponding region.fig.  <dig> the three pst clusters differ mainly in the early regulatory and replication regions. blast comparisons of phage genomes were visualized using easyfig  <cit> . blue shaded regions connect homologous sequences and orange shaded regions connect reverse complemented homologous sequences. arrows represent orfs. light orange, light blue and light yellow arrows represent early regulatory genes, replication genes and antiterminator q, respectively. light pink arrows represent bsubi restriction/modification system. dark pink and green arrows designate the location of stx <dig> and is <dig>  respectively



the sequence divergence within predicted early regulatory and replication genes is contrasted by the conservation of predicted late and structural genes. for instance, one of the late genes encoding a putative lysozyme , shared 95–98 % amino acid sequence identity over the full gene length among the  <dig> clusters .

the pst <dig> cluster is more closely related to the stx2a-converting phage of e. coli o104:h <dig> 2011c- <dig> rather than to pst <dig> and pst3
phage genomes were extracted from  <dig> closed bacterial genomes deposited in genbank , and we compared these to the nine psts established in this study and to seven other representative stx2a-converting phages from the e. coli o157:h <dig> lineage and non-o <dig> serotypes. we identified sequence fragments present in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes using panseq  <cit> , and their distribution, presence or absence, in each phage genome was used to infer a neighbor-joining tree  <cit>  using splitstree  <dig> . the psts within a cluster were located on the same node and this pst <dig> cluster was more related to stx2- phages from highly virulent non-o <dig> strains, such as e. coli o104:h <dig> 2011c- <dig>  <cit> , o103:h <dig>  <cit> , and o103:h <dig>  <cit>  when compared to psts  <dig> or  <dig> fig.  <dig> phages of pst <dig> are related to those from strains associated with high hus rates. host strain names or phage names are indicated. phage genomes were cut into 500 bp fragments. the “core genome” was defined as fragments present in > <dig> phage genomes at > 85 % identity using panseq  <cit> . the presence or absence of core genome fragments in each phage genome was used for clustering. uncorrected p-distance was used to build a neighbor-joining tree using splitstree  <dig>  <cit> . pst <dig>  pst <dig>  and pst <dig> clusters are highlighted by yellow, light purple and orange shading, respectively



blast comparisons  <cit>  were performed between representative psts from each of the  <dig> clusters and the nearest neighbor from fig.  <dig>  pst1- <dig> and the edl <dig> stx2a- phage  <cit> , differed mainly within the predicted phages’ early regulatory and replication region . for pst2- <dig> and the phage in strain e. coli o104:h <dig> 2011c- <dig>  phage regulatory and replication regions showed a higher degree of similarity . noteworthy, the bsubi restriction/modification system in pst2- <dig> is also present in the o104:h <dig> 2011c- <dig> phage genome  <cit> . most differences between the two phages were found within regions encoding orfs with no assigned functions. the most evident difference between pst3- <dig> and the ec <dig> phage was within a region encoding genes for n, ci, and cro .fig.  <dig> alignment of pst1- <dig>  pst2- <dig>  and pst3- <dig> to related phage from e. coli o157:h <dig> strains sakai, o104:h <dig> 2011c- <dig>  and ec <dig>  respectively. blast comparisons of  pst1- <dig> and phage from edl <dig>   pst2- <dig> and phage from o104:h <dig> 2011c- <dig> and  pst3- <dig> and phage from ec <dig> were visualized using easyfig  <cit> . blue shaded regions connect homologous sequences and orange shaded regions connect reverse complemented homologous sequences. arrows represent orfs. light orange, light blue and light yellow arrows represent early regulatory genes, replication genes and antiterminator q, respectively. light pink arrows represent bsubi restriction/modification system. dark pink and green arrows designate the location of stx <dig> and is <dig>  respectively



e. coli o157:h <dig> host genome affects stx <dig> production
our analyses identified for the first time strains of e. coli o157:h <dig>  carrying stx2a-converting phages  that were 100 % identical on the phdna level and had the same insertion site . these strains also carry an stx1-converting phage  <cit> . this provided us with the unique opportunity to use non-manipulated strains to ask whether factors apart from the stx2a-converting phage genome impact toxin production. to first investigate the genetic relatedness of the host strains, we established a phylogenomic framework derived from whole genome alignments of shared regions, excluding prophage, for all  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> genomes  <cit>  . strains pa <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig> and pa <dig> are phylogenetically positioned on separate branches indicating that, as expected, no two chromosomes genomes were identical. next, we measured the stx2a levels and stx2a expression after ciprofloxacin phage-induction . the lowest stx2a producer was pa <dig>  at approximately 1 ng/μg of protein, and the highest producer was pa <dig>  at approximately 5 ng/μg of protein. pa <dig> produced  <dig>  ng/μg, which was significantly different from the previous two strains, while toxin production from strains pa <dig>  and pa <dig>  was only different from pa <dig>  surprisingly, stx2a transcript levels were similar for all strains except for pa <dig>  which was greater than 10-fold above that measured with pa <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig>  or pa <dig> . this observed disconnect indicates that qpcr does not always reflect the level of stx <dig> secreted by e. coli o157:h <dig> fig.  <dig> o157:h <dig> whole genome phylogeny and stx2a-converting phage pst comparison suggests multiple acquisitions of pst <dig> phages. whole bacteria genomes of  <dig> o157:h <dig> strains were aligned using mugsy  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree was inferred using raxml with  <dig> bootstrap replicates  <cit> , and visualized as a cladogram due to high variation in branch length. pst <dig>  pst <dig>  and pst <dig> clusters are shaded in yellow, light purple and orange respectively. corresponding metadata were added with evolview  <cit> 

fig.  <dig> host factors modulate stx2a expression levels.  whole genomes of  <dig> o157:h <dig> strains with pst1- <dig> were aligned using mugsy  <cit>  and the phylogenetic tree was inferred using raxml  <cit>  with  <dig> bootstrap replicates and visualized using figtree  <cit> .  stx <dig> production was quantified by elisa 2 h after ciprofloxacin induction. bars labeled with different letters were significantly different 



discussion
the progression and severity of hus is thought to correlate with the amount of stx <dig> produced by e. coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> . e. coli o157:h <dig> strains vary by their toxin production potential and this likely results in different virulence potentials  <cit> . molecular methods previously grouped e. coli o157:h <dig> strains into three lineages and nine clades  <cit> . lineage i has been more frequently observed with isolates of human origin  than were lineage i/ii or lineage ii isolates  <cit> . this is presumably due, in part, to higher levels of stx <dig> produced by lineage i isolates compared to other lineages  <cit> . as production of stx <dig> is directly linked to phage replication  <cit> , it is not surprising that we were most successful in isolating phdna for sequencing from lineage i isolates. we only obtained sufficient dna from  <dig> out of  <dig> clade  <dig>  strains, which some reports suggested are high stx <dig> producers  <cit> , although another study  <cit>  suggested stx <dig> levels are at least one-log less than lineage i isolates. we were also unable to isolate sufficient phdna from lineage ii  isolates  or from a clade  <dig> isolate ; these groups of isolates are also typically low toxin producers  <cit> . while other temperate phages in e. coli o157:h <dig> are inducible  <cit> , we only obtained sufficient dna to close genomes for two others isolated from pa <dig> and pa <dig> that are related to a phage designated sp <dig> in strain sakai  <cit> . in contrast, the coverage for all stx2a-converting phages sequenced here was 117–573-fold. this data is consistent with the observations that most prophage in the e. coli o157:h <dig> genome are defective  <cit>  and that the genome copy number of stx2a-converting phage upon mitomycin c induction is at least two orders of magnitude higher than for other prophages.

previous studies suggested that genetic polymorphisms between stx2a-converting phage genomes could impact levels of toxin production  <cit> . our study identified eight new genotypes of stx2a-converting phage, almost doubling the number of complete phage genomes varieties deposited. we observed that one major driving force of phage genome diversity is in is <dig> copy number and location variations. this is in accordance with previous studies that identified multiple copies of is <dig>  especially in the prophage, prophage-like and plasmid regions  <cit> . this provides us with several testable hypotheses for how polymorphisms in the phage genome may impact toxin levels. for example, stx2a expression and subsequent release of toxin from the bacteria requires induction of the lytic cycle. noteworthy, we observed a disruption of a putative roi in pst1- <dig> and pst1- <dig>  which encodes a dna-binding protein that inhibits the activation of the lytic cycle  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that the specific is <dig> insertion in pst1- <dig> and pst1- <dig> may increase toxin production in strains carrying these phage sequence types. once stx <dig> is produced, efficient release of the toxin requires lysis of the bacteria. in pst1- <dig>  the gene encoding a putative lysozyme was disrupted which could reduce the amount of toxin released. inactivation of adenine dna methyltransferase genes such as that observed in pst2- <dig> may additionally affect toxin production through de-repressing the lytic cycle  <cit> .

the other major source of phage genome diversity, as noted before  <cit> , was located within early regulatory regions. the diversity of this region is driven by homologous recombination between different lambdoid prophages  <cit> . previous studies have also suggested that polymorphisms in early regulatory genes could lead to differential stx expression  <cit> . for example, the cooperative binding of ci dimers to operator sites designated ol and or maintains the phage in its lysogenic state through repressing transcription from the pl and pr promoters, respectively. the copy number of each operator site can vary, for example e. coli o157:h <dig> strain edl <dig> has two ol sites surrounding pl that are designated ol <dig> and ol <dig>  while the strain sakai also has an ol <dig>  <cit> . four hours post antibiotic phage-induction, stx2a production is greater for edl <dig> than sakai  <cit> , and one reasonable hypothesis could be that this is caused by decreased repression at ol  <cit> . as with the pst <dig> phage from sakai, our pst <dig> phage also had three identifiable ol and or sites, however, we were unable to identify operator sequences or some early regulatory genes in the pst <dig> cluster phages. whether one or more of these differences are responsible for the reduced quantities of toxin produced by strain pa <dig> compared to sakai and edl <dig>  <cit>  remains to be determined.

both pst <dig> and pst <dig> phages are found within clade  <dig> of e. coli o157:h <dig>  which is a subgroup associated with high incidence of hospitalization and hus  <cit> . we found that pst <dig> phages were highly similar to the stx2a phage of e. coli o104:h <dig> 2011c- <dig>  a stx2a-expressing enteroaggregative e. coli  that was responsible for a severe outbreak in germany in  <dig>  <cit> . a related phage designated tl-2011c  is found within the genome of an e. coli o103:h <dig> strain that caused a small outbreak in norway  <cit>  that again was characterized by a high hus rate. future research should investigate whether these phages are indicators of high stx2a producing strains.

diversity within the phage genome undoubtedly plays an important role in toxin production, however other factors encoded within the host may also influence the phage lifestyle  <cit> . our assembly of phage genomes identified several e. coli o157:h <dig> strains carrying identical stx2a-converting prophages that were integrated at the same genomic site. importantly, all of these strains also contain stx1-converting phage, which are known to decrease stx <dig> production in e. coli o157:h <dig> strains carrying both phages  <cit> . thus, by using wild-type clinical isolates that have been minimally passaged since isolation, we could test the hypothesis that genes external to the phage impact toxin production. indeed, we observed a greater than five-fold variation in stx <dig> production between pa <dig> and pa <dig>  demonstrating that future studies investigating the mechanism behind differences in stx expression must take both phage and chromosomal host background into consideration. we also noted some discordance between toxin protein and transcript levels , which is similar to observations with e. coli o157:h <dig> strain tw <dig>  <cit> . this suggests that caution must be taken when assessing potential virulence of e. coli o157:h <dig> by qpcr alone. the identification of highly similar phage was also observed with stx2-converting phage from e. coli o104:h <dig> isolates  <cit> , highlighting a remarkable stability contrasted to the mosaic structure that also exists between phage as reported here and elsewhere  <cit> .

although a single acquisition of the stx2a-converting phage was suggested in the well-established stepwise evolution model from o55:h <dig> to o157:h <dig>  <cit> , prophage regions are also known as hotspots of horizontal gene transfer. laing et al.  <cit>  used both complete genome and wgs to compare stx-converting phage phylogeny with their host bacterial phylogeny and found that the two phylogenies generally agree with each other. however, the phage genomes extracted from wgs were not necessarily fully assembled and this may have influenced the accuracy of this analysis  <cit> . unlike most whole genome shotgun sequencing studies, which do not allow for precise assembly of stx-converting phage regions, our study accomplished this by enriching for and sequencing phdna after removal of bacterial genomic dna. our data suggest that pst <dig> phages in general evolved vertically along with the host. we did however observe that e. coli o157:h <dig> strains pa <dig> and pa <dig>  both of which carry pst <dig> phages, occupy distinct nodes on the tree generated from whole genome alignments . while it is possible that this demonstrates mobilization of the pst <dig> phages, our limited genomic data set is clearly insufficient to make any firm conclusions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study expands our knowledge of the genetic diversity within stx2a-converting phages, and suggests that both phage and bacterial sequences, as well as phage insertion sites modulate stx <dig> production. sequencing additional stx2a-converting phages is justified, but should probably use other approaches as the strategy we took may bias results towards high phage producing strains. next generation sequencing  long read technologies, such as pacbio, have been used by other investigators for accurate phage genome assemblies when other  phages are present as well  <cit> . as a larger number of complete genomes become available, a more comprehensive comparison to other enterobacteria phage lambda will be possible that accounts for exchange of phage through genetic recombination, establishing whether the phage genotypes described could be considered distinct species. this study also serves as robust foundation for future work investigating whether the phage genome polymorphisms observed impact the virulence phenotype, particularly stx <dig> production, both in pure culture and in combination with other members of the gut microbiota.
