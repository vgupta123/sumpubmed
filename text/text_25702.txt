BACKGROUND
primordial germ cells  are the precursors of spermatozoa and oocytes, which are derived from a small number of epiblast cells under induction of bone morphogenetic protein  signaling and other unidentified signals from the extraembryonic ectoderm  and visceral endoderm  at embryonic day   <dig>  in mice  <cit> . following specification, pgcs must become motile and actively migrate across the embryo to reach the developing genital ridge  and form the functional gonads in combination with surrounding somatic cells  <cit> . in mice, the pgcs move from the primitive streak to the endoderm at e <dig>   <cit> . then, they migrate through the hindgut and mesentery and arrive at the gr at approximately e <dig>   <cit> .

previous studies have suggested that the directional migration of pgcs towards the gr is regulated by a combination of attractive and repulsive signals  <cit> . stromal cell-derived factor  <dig>  is the most promising attractant signaling candidate, which is primarily expressed in the gr and surrounding mesenchyme; its receptor, cxcr <dig>  is expressed in pgcs  <cit> . the importance of this chemokine signaling for pgcs migration and colonization has been demonstrated by studying gene knockout mouse models  <cit> . c-kit is another gene that has been implicated in guiding mouse pgc migration. c-kit is expressed in pgcs and its ligand, steel factor, is expressed by somatic cells along the migratory route  <cit> . other than attractive signals, the adhesion molecule e-cadherin  <cit>  and extracellular matrix molecule integrin β <dig>  <cit>  have been reported to be involved in the regulation of pgc migration and colonization in gr. however, the precise function of gr somatic cells in pgcs migration remains to be elucidated.

once the pgcs reach the gr, they lose their motility and proliferate rapidly  <cit> . bmp signaling has been shown to control formation of the pgc niche and proliferation of pgcs within the early gr  <cit> . after sex determination, the germ cells in both male and female embryos cease proliferation. male germ cells arrest at the g <dig> phase of mitosis, while female germ cells initiate meiosis and arrest at the diplotene stage of prophase i  <cit> . whether the proliferation and differentiation of pgcs is a cell autonomous process  <cit>  or is under the control of the surrounding gonadal somatic cells  <cit>  remains an open question.

the wilms' tumor  suppressor gene, wt <dig>  encodes a nuclear zinc finger transcription factor that was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene in patients with wt  <cit> . wt <dig> has been implicated in the regulation of target genes related to proliferation and cell cycle progression  <cit> . wt <dig> is expressed in the urogenital ridge coelomic epithelium and the underlying mesenchymal cells during embryo development  <cit> . it has been reported that wt <dig> is essential for gr development and deletion of wt <dig> results in gonadal agenesis due to the failure of gr development  <cit> . the alkaline phosphatase-positive pgcs are observed in the mesenchyme close to coelomic epithelium in wt1-/- embryo at e <dig>  suggesting that aberrant gr development probably does not interfere with the germ cell migration  <cit> . however, whether the germ cell migrating process is normal and all the germ cells reach the aberrant gr; or the proliferation of germ cells has been affected in wt1-/- embryo remains unclear. wt1r394w mice carry the most common denys-drash syndrome  missense mutation  <cit> . wt <dig> +/r394w mice display severe renal failure, and wt1r394w/r394w mice are embryonically lethal  <cit> . agenesis of gonads and kidneys is also noted in wt1r394w/r394w mice due to aberrant gr development which is similar to wt1-null mice.

in this study we found that the migrating process of pgcs was normal and no ectopic pgcs were observed in wt1r394w/r394w. however, the number of pgcs in wt1r394w/r394w embryos was dramatically reduced compared to control embryos due to the mitotic arrest. in contrast, abnormal proliferation of pgcs was also observed in wt1r394w/r394w embryos at e <dig> . these results suggest that the proliferation of germ cells during the early stage of gonad development is precisely regulated by gr somatic cells, and the gr somatic cells are probably dispensable for directional migration of pgcs.

RESULTS
wt <dig> mutation  results in gr agenesis through mitotic arrest of coelomic epitheliums
the gr arises as a thickening of the epithelium along the coelomic surface of the mesonephros  <cit> . a previous study suggests that wt <dig> plays a critical role in gr development, as deletion of wt <dig> results in aberrant gr development and absence of kidneys and gonads in mice  <cit> . the authors speculate that loss of wt <dig> probably leads to apoptosis of coelomic epithelial cells, which in turn causes gr agenesis in wt1-/- mice  <cit> . however, the exact function of wt <dig> in gr development is unclear.

in this study, wt1r394w point mutation mice strain  <cit>  was used to study the interaction of gr somatic cells and germ cells in gonad development. it has been demonstrated that this mutation causes wt <dig> protein loss of function but does not affect its expression  <cit> ; therefore, we can track the fate of coelomic epithelium, using the anti-wt <dig> antibody. we showed that wt1-positive coelomic epithelial cells were observed as early as e <dig>  in both control  and wt1r394w/r394w embryos . however, further development of wt1-positive coelomic epithelial cells was arrested in wt1r394w/r394w embryos . surprisingly, the results of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick endlabeling  assay showed that the number of apoptotic cells was not increased in wt1-positive coelomic epitheliums  of wt1r394w/r394w embryos compared to control embryos , which was inconsistent with the previous study  <cit> . further study revealed that the proliferation of coelomic epitheliums  in wt1r394w/r394w embryos was significantly reduced, using 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine  incorporation assay .

wt <dig> has been implicated in the regulation of target genes related to cell cycle progression  <cit>  and cyclin e <dig> has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the cell cycle by binding cycle-dependent kinase  <dig> , which phosphorylates rb, leading to transition from g <dig> into s phase  <cit> . to identify the underlying mechanism between wt <dig> loss and mitotic arrest, we identified four potential wt <dig> binding sites within the cyclin e <dig>  <dig> -kb promoter . the luciferase activity of tm <dig> cell transfected with wt1a or b  was increased approximately 7-fold compared with the control. in contrast, no difference was observed between the control and wt1c or d -transfected tm <dig> cells . to determine the effect of wt <dig> in regulating cyclin e <dig> promoter, we created two types of mutations in wt1a  <cit> . mutants contained changes in the zinc finger region, such as r366c, h377y, and r394w, failed to activate the cyclin e <dig> promoter. in contrast, the mutants with mutations outside the zinc finger region, such as f154s and s273a, had transactivational potentials similar to that of wild-type wt1a . together, these results indicate that wt <dig> regulates the expression of cyclin e <dig>  moreover, loss of function of wt <dig> in gr somatic cells induced cell morphological changes characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, accompanied by a complete loss of the epithelial markers e-cadherin and a significant elevation of mesenchymal markers vimentin . taken together, these results indicate that the aberrant gr development in wt1-mutant embryos is due to the mitotic arrest rather than apoptosis of coelomic epitheliums, and wt <dig> is essential for cyclin e <dig> regulation, epithelial cells characteristics maintenance and their normal proliferation.

the directional migration of pgcs is not obviously affected in gr-deficient embryos
previous studies  <cit>  have suggested that gr somatic cells participate in pgcs directional migration, although there is no direct in vivo evidence to support this hypothesis. to explore the roles of gr in pgc migration and later development, the pgcs migration process was attentively examined in control and wt1r394w/r394w embryos. as shown in figure 3d, stella-positive pgcs were observed in the mesenchyme near the coelomic epithelium in wt1r394w/r394w embryos, and the total number of pgcs in both male and female embryo was similar to that in control embryos at e <dig>  , using cross-section number counting of the whole embryo. to further detect the migration process of pgcs in wt1r394w/r394w embryos, cross sections of e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryos were prepared, and the numbers of pgcs at different locations along the migrating pathway were examined in figure  <dig>  at e <dig> , most of the pgcs were observed in the hindgut and mesentery of both control  and wt1r394w/r394w  embryos. at e <dig> , most of the pgcs reached the gr, and very few remained in the mesentery . no difference of pgcs localization was noted between control and wt1r394w/r394w embryos by quantitative analysis . in addition, no ectopic pgcs were detected in wt1r394w/r394w embryos. these results together indicate that functional gr is probably not essential for the directional migration of pgcs and that aberrant gr development does not affect pgc movement.

the expression of sdf <dig>  steel factor and integrin-β <dig> was not changed in wt1r394w/r394w embryos
it has been demonstrated that excreted factors, such as sdf <dig>  steel factor and integrin-β <dig>  involve in the directional migration of pgcs during gonad development  <cit> . to examine whether the expression of these factors is changed in gr-deficient embryos due to wt <dig> mutation, immunofluorescence experiments at e <dig>  were performed. as shown in figure  <dig>  the sdf <dig> protein was expressed in the mesenchymal cells and coelomic epithelium in both control  and wt1r394w/r394w  embryos. high-magnification images showed that the expression of sdf <dig> in the coelomic epithelium was not obviously changed in wt1r394w/r394w embryos  compared with control embryos . steel factor was mainly expressed in the mesentery of both control  and wt1r394w/r394w  embryos. integrin β <dig> was widely expressed in hindgut, mesentery and gr mesenchyme, and no difference was noted between control  and wt1r394w/r394w  embryos. furthermore, we compared transcript levels of c-kit, steel, cxcr <dig>  sdf <dig>  cdh <dig> and integrin-β <dig> between control and wt1r394w/r394w embryos at e <dig> . no differences were detected between samples for any of the genes using real-time rt-pcr , indicating that the expression of factors which were implicated in regulating pgc migration was not changed in wt1r394w/r394w embryos.

the proliferation of pgcs in the developing gonad is regulated by somatic cells
upon reaching the gr, the pgcs proliferated rapidly and their number increased up to approximately  <dig>  by e <dig>   and  <dig>  by e <dig>  . we found that the number of pgcs in wt1r394w/r394w embryos was significantly reduced compared to controls at e <dig>   and e <dig>  . to assess the reason for low pgcs number in wt1r394w/r394w embryos, tunel assay and brdu incorporation experiments were conducted at e <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  no tunel-positive pgcs were observed in control  and wt1r394w/r394w  embryos at e <dig> . numbers  in figure 6n showed the actual number of brdu-positive pgcs over the total number of pgcs counted for that embryo. note that approximately 50% of pgcs in control embryos were brdu-positive , while only approximately 28% of pgcs were brdu-positive in wt1r394w/r394w  embryos. these results indicate that the reduced number of pgcs in gr-deficient embryos is due to the mitotic arrest rather than apoptosis of pgcs. to further explore the molecular mechanism, we next assessed transcript levels for factors that may stimulate pgcs proliferation within e <dig>  gonad. potential factors include the bmp family members and tgf-β family members. the bmp family has been associated with pgcs proliferation within the early gr  <cit>  and two members of the tgf-β family, tgfβ <dig> and activin, limited murine pgcs proliferation  <cit> . bmp <dig> and smads were validated as wt <dig> targets by chip-pcr in kidney  <cit> , suggesting that bmp <dig> might most likely be transcriptional targets of wt <dig>  using real-time rt-pcr, we detected that the mrna levels of bmp <dig> and downstream genes of bmp signaling, including smad <dig> and smad <dig>  were significantly reduced in both male and female wt1r394w/r394w embryos . so, we conclude that the low level of bmp signaling within the gr is one of the reasons accounted for mitotic arrest and low pgcs number in wt1-mutant mice.

after a rapid increase in number, the pgcs cease proliferating after sex determination  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  most of the dazl-positive  germ cells were labeled with ki <dig> at e <dig>   and e <dig>   in control embryos. however, very few ki67-positive male germ cells were noted at e <dig>  , indicating that male germ cells in control embryos are in mitotic arrest at this stage. the percentage of ki67-positive female germ cells was approximately 35%, while approximately 96% of germ cells in wt1r394w/r394w embryos remained ki67-positive at e <dig>  . because a high percentage of germ cells in wt1r394w/r394w embryos does not leave active cell cycle process, it is likely that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor  that inhibited the g1/s transition was relatively down-regulated. we found that expression of p15ink4b and p27kip <dig>  as estimated by real-time rt-pcr, was down-regulated in wt1r394w/r394w germ cells, compared with male germ cells in control . in contrast, there were no significant differences in transcripts of p15ink4b and p27kip <dig> between female germ cells in control and wt1r394w/r394w germ cells . these results together suggest that the proliferation of germ cells during gonad development is precisely regulated by somatic cells and that the aberrant gr development results in abnormal germ cell proliferation.

the pgc identity and pgc-pgc interactions are not changed in wt1r394w/r394w embryos
it has been found that pgcs reside in extragonadal tissues, such as the adrenal and mesonephric tissues in some case  <cit> . the identity of these ectopic pgcs may partially change  <cit> . in our study, the pgcs settled under the epithelium of mesonephros. we questioned whether the pgc identity changed without the support of gr somatic cells. to test, the pgc identity was detected in e <dig>  wt1r394w/r394w embryos. we found that pgcs in both male and female gr-absent embryos still expressed pgc characteristic markers, including stella, ssea- <dig>  blimp <dig>  dazl and the pluripotent marker oct <dig> . in addition, pgc-pgc interactions, such as e-cadherin and β-catenin were maintained in e <dig>  wt1r394w/r394w embryos . these results suggest that the pgc identity and important characteristics do not alter in wt1r394w/r394w embryos. the mrna level of pgc characteristic markers , and pgc-pgc interaction markers  were not changed between control and wt1r394w/r394w embryos, detected by real-time rt-pcr, and normalized against the pgc-specific marker stella.

discussion
the pgcs are formed distantly from their final destination, thus, they must migrate for a long distance to reach the gr. the precise mechanism that regulates the directional migration of pgcs towards the gr remains an open question  <cit> . the widely accepted hypothesis suggests that the pgcs are attracted by the factors that are emitted from the destination or by somatic cells along their migratory route. in vitro studies have demonstrated that the gr tissue from e <dig>  embryos attracts pgcs migration  <cit> . several genes have been implicated in the process of pgc migration, such as sdf- <dig>  steel factor, integrinβ <dig>  <cit>  and e-cadherin  <cit> , and the inactivation of these genes results in aberrant pgc migration. in this study, a gr-deficient mouse model, wt1r394w/r394w, was used to study the roles of the gr in germ cell migration and development. we found that the migration of pgcs in gr-deficient embryos was normal, which was consistent with a previous study  <cit> . stella-positive pgcs reached the mesenchyme under the coelomic epithelium at e <dig> , and no ectopic pgcs were observed in gr-deficient embryos. however, the number of pgcs was dramatically reduced in gr-deficient at e <dig>  and e <dig> . further study revealed that the decrease of pgc number was due to the reduced proliferation but not cell apoptosis.

sdf <dig>  steel factor and integrinβ <dig> have been reported to play important roles in regulating pgc migration  <cit> . in this study, we found that the expression of these proteins was not restricted to gr somatic cells and the protein level was also not changed in wt1r394w/r394w embryos compared to control embryos. these results suggest that the signals that regulate pgc migration probably not only come from gr somatic cells, but the factors from hindgut, mesentery and the mesenchymal cells around gr also play important roles in this process. given that pgcs begin to migrate at approximately e <dig> , while the gr is not visible until approximately e <dig>  in mice, the early stage of pgc migration is most likely regulated by somatic cells along the migrating pathway, not by signals from the gr. in this study, we found that the gr development was blocked in wt1r394w/r394w embryos due to wt <dig> mutation. however, the coelomic epithelium was still maintained from e <dig>  to e <dig> . we could not exclude the possibility that the developmentally arrested coelomic epithelial cells still can secret some unknown factors which attract the pgc migration, and other functional gr is not essential for germ cell migration. we also found that most of the pgcs in control and wt1r394w/r394w embryos arrived at the mesenchyme near the coelomic epithelium at e <dig> . however, at e <dig>  and e <dig> , all the germ cells in control embryos were colonized into the developing gr , whereas, the germ cells in gr-deficient embryos were scattered widely under the coelomic epithelium instead . these results suggest that gr somatic cells are important for the precise positioning of pgcs at the final step of migration.

during and after colonization into the gr, pgcs proliferate rapidly, and their number is increased dramatically from approximately  <dig> to  <dig>  by e <dig>   <cit> . after sex determination, most germ cells enter mitotic arrest  <cit> . whether the proliferation of germ cells is a cell autonomous process or regulated by gr somatic cells is unclear. in this study, we found that the proliferation of pgcs was dramatically reduced in wt1r394w/r394w embryos at e <dig>  and e <dig>  compared to control embryos, whereas, the germ cells in wt1r394w/r394w embryos were still mitotically active at e <dig>  when all the germ cells stop proliferation in control embryos, indicating that the proliferation of germ cells is precisely regulated by gr somatic cells during the early stage of gonad development, and disruption of gr development results in aberrant germ cell proliferation. our results were consistent with previous in vitro studies, which showed that soluble factors released by gr regulated the proliferation of pgcs using the medium conditioned by different embryonic tissues  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study provide in vivo evidence that the proliferation of germ cells is tightly regulated by gr somatic cells during the early stage of gonad development. the directional migration of pgcs is not affected, but the precise positioning of pgcs at the final step of migration is disrupted in gr-deficient embryos, suggesting that the functional gr is not essential for pgc migration. however, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation await further investigation.
