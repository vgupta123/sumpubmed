BACKGROUND
chemokines are a superfamily of small chemotactic proteins that have been classified into four major subfamilies, namely cxc, cc, c, and cx3c, based on the presence or absence and positional arrangement of n-terminal cysteine  residues  <cit> . one of the hallmarks of chemokine function is to facilitate trafficking and recirculation of immune cells from the circulation and tissues into secondary lymphatic organs and various peripheral tissues to maintain immune homeostasis in vivo  <cit> . these ligands also control the selective recruitment of specific leukocyte subsets to sites of inflammation and immune reactions. besides migration, chemokines also induce the rapid activation of integrin molecules. the two cxc chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein- <dig>  and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant , are members of the cxcl <dig> subfamily containing a glutamate-leucine-arginine  motif that are well known for their ability to induce the activation and recruitment of neutrophils in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . these chemokines are also believed to be the murine structural and functional homologues of human cxcl <dig>  il- <dig> and chemokine growth-related oncogene   <cit> . mip- <dig> and kc display high affinity binding and signaling through the murine cxcr <dig>  a 7-transmembrane g protein-coupled receptor  <cit> .

it has been well established that endotoxin and various proinflammatory cytokines  stimulate the expression of mip- <dig> by macrophages, neutrophils and epithelial cells  <cit> . numerous studies have also demonstrated a pathophysiological role for mip- <dig> and kc in several inflammatory disease states including endotoxemia-induced lung injury  <cit> , 1996), glomerulonephritis  <cit> , bacterial meningitis  <cit>  and herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  infection  <cit> . in mice, the cellular sources of mip- <dig> have been confirmed to be macrophages  <cit> , epithelial cells  <cit> , bone marrow endothelial cells  <cit> , astrocytes  <cit>  and mast cells  <cit> . in humans, in addition to macrophages, monocytes, t, nk and b cells have also been shown to produce and respond to cxcl <dig>  <cit> . despite all of these reports, few studies have focused on chemokine production by b cells and the relevance of such production in cell-mediated immune responses.

age-related dysfunction of the immune system has often been attributed to a variety of measurable changes in the functional activity of many immunomodulatory factors. this immune deterioration with age is believed to contribute to the morbidity and mortality in humans, possibly due to the greater incidence of infection, autoimmunity and cancer in the elderly. dysregulation of lymphocyte function is thought to play a critical part in these processes. many factors are believed to contribute to age-associated immunodeficiencies including defects in cellular signaling, stem cell and bone marrow defects, thymus involution, alterations in hormone and growth factor production, and replicative senescence. chemokines are believed to play a pivotal role in the complex communication network between different cell types that enable the selective trafficking of many immune effector cells to the necessary sites at the appropriate times. several reports have also demonstrated increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the circulation and by peripheral blood cells with age suggesting that uncontrolled inflammation may contribute to the increased susceptibility to infection and injury in certain aged cohorts. for example, il- <dig> chemokine production by human t, nk and monocytes is altered with age in response to bacteria products  <cit> . alterations in chemokine production and responsiveness may have a significant impact on the capacity of aged subjects to control or even mount an immune response.

the objective of the current study is to explore both young and aged murine splenic b cells and b cell subsets for their ability to express the cxc chemokines, mip- <dig> and kc, in response to lps and other stimuli. three b cell subpopulations were studied here including:  marginal zone  b cells, which are uniquely positioned in the marginal sinus where they interact with efficient ag trapping circulating cells and are thought to be involved in the early response against thymus-independent  blood-borne ags  <cit> ;  follicular  b cells, which are long-lived recruiting b cells located at the border of the b cells follicle and the t cell containing pals zone that facilitate responses to thymus-dependent  ags and give rise to both germinal center  b cells and plasma cells  <cit> ; and  newly formed  b cells, which correspond to the recently immigrated b cells from the bone marrow and have been described as immature/transitional b cells and the precursors of fo and mz b cells  <cit> . we also investigated the effect of these b cell-derived chemokines on splenocyte migration and the influence of aging on this event. the relevance of these findings to the generation of humoral and cellular immune responses shall be discussed.

RESULTS
as expression of mip- <dig> and kc by murine splenic b cells has not been previously defined, we initially examined whether murine b cells are capable of producing the cxcl <dig> chemokines, mip- <dig> and kc, upon culture or post cellular activation with lps, anti-igm or cd <dig> mab in combination with il- <dig> for  <dig> h. culture supernatants were subsequently examined for mip- <dig> and kc expression using elisa analysis. the results shown in figure 1a demonstrate that while cultured non-stimulated splenic b cells failed to spontaneously produce detectable levels of mip- <dig> and kc , stimulation of b cells with lps, but not anti-igm or cd <dig> mab in combination with il- <dig>  resulted in the significant increase in the expressions of both of these chemokines. interestingly, the quantity of mip- <dig> produced in response to lps was significantly greater than kc. fig. 1b shows representative images of mip- <dig> expression patterns in the cytoplasm of lps-stimulated splenic b cells. visually, accumulation of cytoplasmic mip- <dig> was observed in splenic b cells  following  <dig> h incubation with lps, but was less evident in non-stimulated splenic b cells. similar results were also obtained examining cytoplasmic kc . in agreement with the above findings, mip- <dig> and kc mrna was only detected in lps-  but not anti-μ- or anti-cd <dig> mab/il-4-stimulated  b cells. consistent with protein expression, the mrna levels for mip- <dig> were expressed at a greater level than kc. as the engagement of the b cell receptor  initiates signaling pathways mediated through nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, including fyn, lyn, syk, and bruton's tyrosine kinase , while lps activate b cells by stimulating signaling through toll-like receptors, more specifically tlr <dig>  the cc chemokines, mip-1α and mip-1β, have been shown to be induced and secreted by human b cells in response to bcr signaling  <cit> . in contrast, the lack of cxcl <dig> chemokine induction in response to cross-linking of the bcr with soluble anti-igm antibody here suggests that the bcr signal may not be optimal and/or essential for mip- <dig> and kc production. perhaps additional costimulatory signals or activation pathways may be necessary for cxcl <dig> production in combination with bcr signaling. these data demonstrate that murine splenic b cells are capable of secreting the cxcl <dig> ligands upon activation with lps but not via anti-μ or anti-cd <dig> stimulation.

several reports have demonstrated that the proliferative response of whole spleen cells to lps declines with age  <cit> . the results in figure 2a demonstrate that purified splenic b cells derived from aged mice also display a significantly diminished proliferative response when cultured with lps for  <dig> h when compared to b cells derived from younger mice. however, no significant differences in cellular proliferation were observed between young and aged mice after  <dig> h of culture, which is in accordance with the previous report  <cit> .

despite no significant differences in lps proliferative responses between young an aged mice at  <dig> h, lps-stimulated b cells derived from young mice demonstrated approximately  <dig> times greater levels of mip- <dig> in the culture supernatants than aged b cells during this same time period. similarly, reduced levels of kc expression were also detected in the  <dig> h culture supernatants lps-stimulated b cells derived from aged mice when compared to younger animals . moreover, as shown in fig. 2c, splenic b cells from aged mice demonstrate significantly less expression of intracytoplasmic mip- <dig> and kc upon stimulation with lps when compared to younger b cells. these results were supported by conventional rt-pcr analysis where mip- <dig> and kc mrna signals were barely detectable in both freshly isolated and non-stimulated splenic b cells from young or aged mice. the mrna levels of mip- <dig> and kc chemokines in lps-stimulated b cells from aged mice were dramatically lower  than those in younger mice . unlike mip- <dig>  the kc mrna signal was only detected after  <dig> h of stimulation with lps and demonstrated similar patterns of age-associated expression as mip- <dig>  furthermore, real time rt-pcr analysis also demonstrated similar age-related alterations in b cell-derived mip- <dig> and kc mrna expression, albeit after  <dig> h of lps stimulation .

similar results were obtained using an in vitro b cell culture system in which murine naïve b cells can be activated and induced to proliferate and differentiate into ab-forming cells. the el- <dig> system has been described as a potent in vitro culture system for b activation, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . naive b cells cultured in the el- <dig> system differentiate to ig-secreting cells expressing switched isotypes and a plasma cell phenotype . the presence of both lps-dependent and t cell-dependent stimulation  contribute to the plasma cell differentiation in this model system. here, splenic b cells derived from young and aged mice were co-cultured with irradiated el- <dig> thymoma cells in presence of lps and a macrophage-derived culture supernatant. mip- <dig> and kc levels were assessed in the supernatants of those cultures via elisa on days  <dig> or  <dig>  as shown in fig. 3a, splenic b cells cultured in this el- <dig> culture system yielded similar results to those observed in fig.  <dig>  briefly, a considerable reduction of mip- <dig> production by aged splenic b cells was observed in comparison to b cells derived from younger animals. interestingly, no kc expression was detected in any of the aged b cell cultures while significant kc production was observed in the  <dig> and 5-day culture supernatant of young b cells. furthermore, real time rt-pcr also demonstrated a significant reduction in the mrna expression of mip- <dig> and kc in lps-activated aged b cells when compared to younger b cell cultures . moreover, given our data in figure  <dig> demonstrating that cross-linking of cd <dig> by anti-cd <dig> antibody and il- <dig> failed to elicit cxcl <dig> chemokine secretion by b cells, the b cell-derived mip-2/kc secretion in el- <dig> system may be attributed to the effect of lps-dependent signals rather than cd <dig> cross-linking signals and/or other cytokines/lymphokines presented in the culture. taken together, these results demonstrate that mip- <dig> and kc expression by murine splenic b cells is significantly altered with increasing age.

splenic b cells derived from adult mice are comprised of several distinctive subpopulations based on their surface marker expression  <cit> . to assess if the cxcl <dig> ligand expression differences observed between young and aged mice are due to differences in b cell subsets, mz, fo, and nf b cells as well as total igm+ b cells were sorted by facs based on their surface igm, cd <dig>  and cd <dig> markers . sorted individual b cell subpopulations were co-cultured with el- <dig> cells for  <dig> days. similar to our above results, total igm+ splenic b cells derived from aged mice expressed significantly reduced levels of mip- <dig> compared to young b cells. moreover, although mip- <dig> secretion by nf b cells derived from aged mice did not significantly differ from young nf b cells, the levels of mip- <dig> expressed by aged fo b cells were substantially diminished in comparison to b cells derived from their younger counterparts. furthermore, unlike mz b cells derived from young mice, mip- <dig> production was almost undetectable in mz b cells obtained from aged mice . in support of these data, mip- <dig> mrna expression was significantly reduced in aged fo and mz b cells but not in aged nf b cells when compared to b cells derived from younger mice . similar results were observed on day  <dig> . unfortunately, in several repeated subset studies, we were unable to detect kc in the culture supernatants of b cell subsets derived from young and aged mice. we believe this may be due to the low level of kc produced by the splenic b cell subsets compared to non-sorted, non-fractionated splenic b cells, which were also quite low albeit detectable. b cells stimulated with el- <dig> t cells behave differently than lps-stimulated primary b cells. b cells co-cultured with el- <dig> cells demonstrate better viability and more plasmocytic differentiation than lps alone. thus, b cells are in different states of activation in these two culture systems and may account for the differences in kc expression.

given the possibility that the reduced mip- <dig> and kc expression by aged b cells in these el- <dig> cultures might reflect a diminished capacity of these cells to proliferate and/or differentiate, we examined the proliferative response as well as the generation of class switched b cells in the culture of those b cells. by culturing mz, fo and nf b cell subpopulations as well as igm+ b cells on el- <dig>  no defect in the cell proliferations was found among those distinct b cell subsets in aged mice on day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  of culture. it should be noted that the el- <dig> cells utilized in these assays were thymidine kinase deficient  <cit>  and thus, the background thymidine incorporation was quite low .

on the other hand, analysis of both percentages  and the absolute number of igg1+ b cells  revealed that the frequency of igg1+ b cells presented in the aged b cell culture were comparable to those generated in the young b cell culture in response to lps. furthermore, elisa analysis of ig levels in culture supernatants demonstrated no difference in the level of igg produced by young and aged splenic b cells in response to lps . these studies suggest that the reduced mip- <dig> and kc production observed in el- <dig> b cell subset cultures are not due to significant alterations in cellular proliferation and/or differentiation.

to assess the potential functional relevance of mip- <dig> and kc expression by lps-stimulated splenic b cells, splenocytes derived from young mice were labeled with hoechst and examined for their ability to migrate in response to culture supernatants derived from lps-stimulated young and aged cells. the results in fig. 6a show that culture supernatants of lps-stimulated splenic b cells from either young and aged mice induced significant responder cell migration, as compared with non stimulated b cells-derived supernatants. more importantly, the chemotactic activity of culture supernatants derived from lps-activated younger b cells was significantly higher than the activity observed in response to supernatants derived from lps-stimulated aged b cells. interestingly, the addition of anti-mip- <dig> ab to the b cell cultures resulted in an approximate 5% reduction of the migratory capacity of the young responder cells to migrate in response to the lps-derived supernatants of young b cells but this antibody addition failed to exhibit any significant inhibition of migration induced by aged b cell supernatants . neutralization of responder cell migration was also significantly blocked with anti-kc ab  in the young but not aged b cell supernatants. additional neutralization studies using a panel of anti-chemokine antibodies revealed that several cc chemokines are also being made by b cells and are playing a role in the remaining chemotaxis observed using these young responder cell populations . overall, these results suggest that b cell-derived mip- <dig> and kc may play a possible role in leukocyte trafficking and that the mip- <dig> and kc derived from these b cell cultures are biologically active.

in the current study, we report that endotoxin-activated murine b cells express and secrete the cxc chemokines, mip- <dig> and kc. these results are in accordance with the previous studies, which demonstrate that activated human b cells express and secrete cxcl <dig>  <cit> . we also demonstrate that the expression of cxcl <dig> chemokines, mip- <dig> and kc, decline with age in murine splenocytes and b cells, particularly evident in mz and fo b cell subsets . this could not be attributed to impaired numbers of mz and fo b cells as judged by flow cytometric analysis as young and aged b cells demonstrated comparable numbers of these populations . in addition, these differences could also not be attributed to the alterations in proliferation  or terminal differentiation of these cells to igg plasma cells . thus, the downregulation of mip-2/kc chemokine production in response to lps by mz and fo b cells from aged in relation to young mice appears to be due to an age-dependent signaling difference in response to lps. in this respect, the expression and function of the lps receptor tlr <dig> has been shown impaired in aged animals  <cit> . in addition, aging can affect gene regulation and some transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa b  are required for induction by lps of mip-2/kc expression through tlr <dig>  <cit> . thus, further studies will be necessary to elucidate the relevance of age-related alterations in tlr <dig> expression and/or function as well as nfκb-dependent transcriptional control in the age-related decline of cxcl <dig> expression in murine b cells.

the accumulation of mip- <dig> and kc in tissues is known as an important event in early host defense against bacteria infection. moreover, evidence indicates the mz b cells are involved in the early stages of immune response against ti type  <dig>  ags derived from a number of encapsulated bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitides, and haemophilus influenzae  <cit> . mz b cells generate an early igm producing plasma response after in vivo stimulation with ti antigen  <cit> . the remarkable correlation between the ability of mz b cells to mount an immune response against bacterial-associated antigens and our observation showing that these cells produce neutrophil-attracting chemokines mip-2/kc in response to lps indicate a potential dual role for mz b cells in preventing host from bacterial infection. of particular significance for the functionality of mz b cells, we found that mz b cell-derived mip- <dig> and kc expression was impaired in aged mice. although ti-2-specific ab immune responses were not found to be significantly altered with age  <cit> , the diminished capacity of aging immune system to mount an optimal antibody response to encapsulated microbes could be attributed, at least in part, to the diminished capacity of lymphocytes to express inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as mip- <dig> and kc. alterations in cxcl <dig> chemokine production by aged b cells may also have implications in the secondary recruitment of granulocytes to local immune responses at peripheral sites or even within secondary lymphatic organs such as the mucosal immune system in the aged host.

murine mip- <dig> and kc exhibit similar expression patterns and functional activities to that of human il- <dig> in inflammatory response. for example, it has been previously shown that a significant increase of il- <dig> or mip- <dig> in human and mice, respectively, occurs in the grain dust-induced inflammation of the lower respiratory tract  <cit> . although age-related alterations in il- <dig> production by human b cells have not yet been described, diminished expression of il- <dig> has been observed in cultured il-2-stimulated nk cells  <cit>  and lps-stimulated monocytes  <cit>  derived from elderly subjects. these data suggest that an age-related mip- <dig> or il- <dig> production could be consequence of a defective functional activity of b cells in aging.

it should also be noticed that human il- <dig> has been shown to be a potent chemoattractant for human b cells  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that chemotactic activity of culture supernatant from young b cells was dramatically higher than that from aged b cells . neutralization of these chemokines effects with addition of anti-mip- <dig> and anti-kc abs to the cultures resulted in a significant reduction of the migratory capacity of spleen cells to the culture supernatant from young, but not from aged b cells . this may be due to the low levels of mip- <dig> and kc present in the culture supernatants of aged b cells that were not sufficient to induce significant migration of spleen cells to them. in addition, antibodies specific to kc and mip- <dig> partially blocked the young splenic b cell-derived chemotactic activity toward splenocytes for approximately 20% and 5%, respectively, although high level of mip- <dig> was present in the culture supernatants. the low ability of neutralizing anti-mip- <dig> ab to alter splenocyte migration suggests that mip- <dig> produced by b cells may be a weaker migratory factor for murine splenocytes in relation to kc. as mz b cells in spleen produce both mip- <dig> and kc, one could hypothesize that these chemokines may facilitate b cell migration into and within the mz area and/or amplify their activity and thus contributing to host defense.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrate for the first time that murine splenic b cells are highly efficient in producing elr-positive cxc inflammatory chemokines, in particular mip- <dig>  upon activation by lps stimulation. moreover, mip- <dig> production, particularly by mz b cells, was found to decline with age. our finding suggests a possible linkage between functional activity of mz b cells in production of neutrophil-attracting inflammatory chemokines and host defense. however, detailed and well-controlled in vivo studies will be necessary to assess these various possibilities and the significance of this cxcl <dig> production defect by aged b cells.
