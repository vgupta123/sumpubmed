BACKGROUND
aryl hydrocarbon receptor  is a ligand-activated transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix/per-arnt-sim family. in the absence of ligand, ahr is present in the cytosol in the form of a complex with two chaperone hsp90s, a smal protein , and an immunophilin-like protein   <cit> . upon ligand such as  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin  binding, the chaperon proteins dissociate and ahr translocate into the nucleus to form a heterodimer with its partner molecule aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator   <cit> . this heterodimer binds to the specific dna region termed dioxin response element , which has a core sequence of 5'-tngcgtg-3', and thereby activates a battery of genes expression  <cit> .

historically, studies of ahr pathway have focused on the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome p <dig> enzymes  <cit> . recent studies demonstrated a close relationship between ahr and mammary gland tumorigenesis  <cit> . ahr gene polymorphisms have been linked to an increased risk of lung and breast cancers  <cit> . increased expression of ahr has been reported in lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers in humans  <cit> . studies also suggest that constitutively active ahr may promote hepatocarcinogenesis in mice  <cit> . these data indicated a close relationship between ahr and tumorigenesis. however, the relationship between ahr and tumor progression is not clear.

tumor cells invasion and metastasis is a complicated process among which degradation of extracellular matrix  and basement membrane is a crucial step. tumor invasion and metastasis relies on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases  to destroy the ecm and basement membrane to allow cell migration. mmps are a group of zinc dependent metallopeptidases  <cit> . matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  is one of the type iv collagenase/gelatinases, which degrade basement membrane collagens and gelatins  <cit> . mmp- <dig> is widely associated with tumor invasion and metastasis  <cit> . the synthesis of mmp- <dig> is regulated by several growth factors, cytokines and hormones  <cit> . recent study linked tcdd-associated lesions with aberrant matrix metabolism  <cit> . microarray data demonstrate that tcdd/ahr alter expression of genes involve in matrix metabolism and deposition  <cit> . villano et al  <cit>  and haque et al  <cit>  reported that ahr agonist tcdd could induce mmp- <dig> expression in huamn melanoma cells and prostate cancer cells. these studies suggest that the mmp- <dig> expression may be a common endpoint for activation of the ahr pathway  <cit> .

gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death in the world  <cit> . gastric cancer cells invasion and metastasis often lead to a poor prognosis. several studies linked ahr pathway activation to gastric carcinogenesis. chen et al found increased expression of ahr in two human gastric cancer cell lines  by microarray analysis  <cit> . ma et al reported that concurrent expression of ahr and cyp1a <dig> is correlated with gastric cancer development  <cit> . andersson et al found that constitutively activated ahr could induce stomach tumors in a transgenic mouse model  <cit> . in another of our studies, we found that ahr expression and nuclear translocation were significant higher in gastric cancer than in premalignant lesions and normal gastric mucosa  <cit> . however, the relationship between ahr pathway activation and gastric cancer invasion and metastasis is still not clear. therefore, we investigated the effect of ahr pathway activation on human gastric cancer cells. our data presented here demonstrate that ahr pathway can be activated in gastric cancer ags cells and ahr pathway activation in ags cells induces mmp- <dig> expression and enhances ags cells migration and invasion activity. furthermore, our data show that this ahr activation-induced mmp- <dig> expression is mediated by c-jun.

RESULTS
ahr pathway activation in ags cells
in another of our studies we have demonstrated that there was a high level of ahr expression in ags cells  <cit> . to determine whether ahr pathway can be activated in this cell line, we examined the expression of cytochrome p- <dig> 1a <dig> , a classic target gene of ahr pathway, following ahr agonist tcdd exposure. rt-pcr and western blot analysis showed that both cyp1a <dig> mrna  and protein  expression in ags cells were increased in a dose-dependent manner following tcdd treatment. to determine whether this tcdd-induced cyp1a <dig> expression is ahr-dependent, ahr antagonist resveratrol  was used to block ahr pathway. as shown in fig. 1c and 1d, rsv could reverse tcdd-induced cyp1a <dig> expression in a dose-dependent manner. these data demonstrated that ahr pathway can be activated in ags cells by tcdd.

ahr pathway activation in ags cells induce mmp- <dig> expression
previous studies have shown that in several cancer cells, ahr agonist tcdd exposure activates mmp- <dig> gene expression  <cit> . in order to determine whether tcdd treatment of ags cells results in an induction of mmp- <dig> expression, we detected mmp- <dig> mrna using rt-pcr following tcdd exposure. as shown in fig. 2a, mmp- <dig> mrna expression was induced in a dose-dependent manner following tcdd treatment. to examine the role of the ahr pathway in mediating tcdd-induced mmp- <dig> expression in ags cells, cultures were co-treated with tcdd and the ahr antagonist resveratrol. co-treatment with resveratrol abolished tcdd-induced mmp- <dig> expression  demonstrated that tcdd-activation of mmp- <dig> expression is dependent on the ahr pathway. above data indicate that ahr pathway activation in ags cells induces mmp- <dig> mrna expression. in most cell types, the gene transcription of mmp- <dig> is inducible, and after translation the enzyme is immediately secreted and activated through the cysteine-switch mechanism  <cit> . to determine whether these changes in gene expression following ahr pathway activation result in changes in mmp- <dig> enzymatic activity, we performed gelatin zymography. the results showed that mmp- <dig> activity in media is gradually increased with the concentration increase of tcdd in media  and these changes could be reversed by resveratrol treatment in a dose-dependent manner . these data demonstrate that ahr pathway activation-induced increase in mmp- <dig> expression correlates with an increase in mmp- <dig> activity.

ahr pathway activation enhances ags cells migration and invasion
mmp- <dig> is one of the type iv collagenase/gelatinases that can degrade ecm components. mmp- <dig> is widely associated with tumor invasion and metastasis  <cit> . studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between mmp- <dig> expression and invasiveness and lymph node metastasis of gastric carcinomas  <cit> . to examine whether ahr activation-induced mmp- <dig> expression and activity in ags cells results in increased migration and invasion, we performed wound healing migration assay and transwell migration and invasion assay. after tcdd treatment, the migration distance of ags cells was significantly increased with a dose-dependent manner when compared with control cells  . transwell results showed a significant increase of migration  and invasion  abilities of ags cells when the cells were incubated with tcdd in concentrations from  <dig>  nmol/l  to  <dig> nmol/l . no significant effect on the migration and invasion was found at tcdd concentration <  <dig>  nmol/l . these results demonstrated that ahr pathway activation enhances gastric cancer ags cells migration and invasion. degradation of ecm and basement membrane is an essential step in tumor invasion and metastasis. it involves the action of matrix metalloproteinases . our study demonstrated that ahr pathway activation could induce mmp- <dig> expression and enzymatic activity, and promote ags cells migration and invasion. other studies indicated that ahr pathway activation could induce a variety of mmps expression  <cit> . ahr pathway activation enhances gastric cancer ags cells migration and invasion may be also due to other mmps expression besides mmp- <dig> expression.

c-jun mediated mmp- <dig> expression induced by ahr pathway activation
the mechanism of tcdd-induced changes in mmp- <dig> expression is not entirely clear. recent studies reported that tcdd can induce c-jun expression  <cit>  and c-jun is a target gene of ahr pathway  <cit> ; the promoter sequence in the 5'-flanking region of human mmp- <dig> gene contains c-jun binding sites  <cit>  and c-jun can induced mmp- <dig> expression  <cit> ; the transcription activity of c-jun is significant enhanced in gastric cancer  <cit> . basing on these study results, we proposed a hypothesis that tcdd-induced mmp- <dig> expression in ags cells is mediated by c-jun. to demonstrate this hypothesis, we first detected the c-jun expression in ags cells following tcdd treatment, and found that both c-jun mrna  and protein  expression in ags cells were increased in a dose  and time  dependent manner following tcdd treatment, and this tcdd-induced c-jun expression could be reserved by ahr antagonist resveratrol . above data demonstrated that c-jun is a target gene of ahr pathway in ags cells. to further demonstrate that c-jun can mediate tcdd-induced mmp- <dig> expression, sirna transfection was performed to silence c-jun mrna in ags cells. the results demonstrated that c-jun sirna  transfection almost completely abolished c-jun expression in ags cells both in mrna level  and in protein level . therefore, after c-jun sirna transfection for  <dig> hours, ags cells were treated with tcdd at concentration  <dig> nmol/l for  <dig> hours, cell pellet and culture media were collected, and mmp- <dig> mrna expression and activity were measured. as shown in fig. 4i and 4j, mmp- <dig> mrna expression and activity in untreated control ags cells were very weak; after tcdd  treatment, mmp- <dig> mrna expression and activity were significant increased; this tcdd-induced mmp- <dig> expression and activity increase could be abolished by c-jun sirna transfection and not be influenced by control sirna transfection. above data demonstrated that c-jun mediated mmp- <dig> expression induced by ahr pathway activation in ags cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study demonstrate that ahr pathway can be activated in gastric cancer ags cells and ahr pathway activation induces mmp- <dig> expression and activity which ultimately contributes to ags migration and invasion in vitro. furthermore, our data show that this ahr activation-induced mmp- <dig> expression is mediated by c-jun. because degradation of ecm and basement membrane is an essential step in tumor invasion and metastasis, our results provide insight into the mechanism and function of the ahr pathway and its impact on these processes during gastric cancer progression.
