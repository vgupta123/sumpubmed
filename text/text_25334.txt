BACKGROUND
mammary gland carcinomas are the most common neoplasms in both women and female dogs  <cit> . clinical evidence has shown that approximately 50% of canine mammary tumors  are diagnosed as malignant in dogs  <cit> . cmts possess epidemiological, clinicopathological, and biochemical characteristics similar to those of human breast carcinomas  <cit> . therefore, cmts have been considered an appropriate and valid model for human breast cancer studies for more than three decades  <cit> .

tumor cell lines have been widely used for in vitro research, and have proven to be a particularly useful tool for genetic analyses. previous characterizations of tumor cell lines have shown that they are also excellent models for studying the biological mechanisms underlying cancer  <cit> . the use of tumor cell lines has increased our knowledge of the deregulated genes and signaling pathways involved in cancer  <cit> . furthermore, original cell models have been developed to test anticancer drugs . tumor cell lines continue to be used in the development of new therapies  <cit> , and also provide an alternative to direct transplantation of tumors in animals for testing chemotherapeutics  <cit> .

the use of an appropriate in vitro model is crucial in cancer research. different cell models are used to investigate genetic, epigenetic, and cellular pathways  <cit> ; proliferation deregulation, apoptosis, and cancer progression  <cit> ; and identification of potential molecular markers  <cit> , as well as to screen and characterize cancer therapeutics  <cit> . the findings reported from tumor cell lines are typically extrapolated to in vivo human tumors  <cit> . thus, many biomedical and pharmaceutical companies have recognized the importance of tumor cell lines as models for drug testing and translational studies  <cit> .

in the present study, we established and characterized two new cmt cell lines, termed dtk-e and dtk-sme. these two cell lines exhibited significant diversity in cell morphology, protein marker expression, tumorigenicity, and chemoresistance. our results suggest that the two established cell lines might constitute a useful experimental model for investigating the tumorigenesis of mammary carcinomas and for screening potential anticancer drugs.

RESULTS
morphological analysis of established cell lines
after over  <dig> passages, two cmt cell lines, dtk-e and dtk-sme, were established from canine mammary carcinomas. when adhered to a culture plate, dtk-e cells exhibited a large, flat, epithelial-like morphology , while dtk-sme cells presented a rounded, epithelial-like morphology . of the two established cell lines, only dtk-sme cells possessed pile up . transmission electron micrographs showed that both dtk-e and dtk-sme cells exhibited high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios and large nucleoli .figure  <dig>

biological analysis of established cell lines
alterations in the biological properties of the two cmt cell lines were monitored during their establishment. during the first  <dig> passages, 50% fetal bovine serum  was required to maintain cell growth. after  <dig> passages, the percentage of fbs in the medium was gradually reduced. after  <dig> passages, 5% fbs was sufficient to support the growth of both cmt cell lines. in addition, contact inhibition was only significant during the first  <dig> passages, and was completely lost after  <dig> passages . during establishment of the two cmt cell lines, we also determined the doubling time. the final doubling times for dtk-e and dtk-sme cells were 24 h and 18 h, respectively .figure  <dig>

expression profile of cmt genes and proteins
we used western blot analysis with specific antibodies to investigate the individual protein expression profiles of the two cmt cell lines . both cmt cell lines expressed the low-molecular weight cytokeratin ae <dig> and vimentin, cytokeratin  <dig> , and heat shock protein  <dig>  . in addition, dtk-sme exhibited a higher level of hsp <dig> expression than dtk-e cells. in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  assays, the ck <dig> and hsp <dig> gene expression profiles were the same as their respective protein expression profiles; both dtk-e and dtk-sme cells expressed ck <dig> and hsp <dig> genes .table  <dig>

tumorigenicity of established cmt cell lines
we performed xenografts to examine the tumorigenicity of the two cmt cell lines. at passage  <dig>  each cell line was injected subcutaneously into five 8-week-old athymic mice . a tumor mass was first observed at the injection site in all mice injected with dtk-e and dtk-sme cells at 1 week post-injection; at 8 weeks, the dtk-sme and dtk-e groups exhibited masses of  <dig> – <dig>  cm and  <dig> – <dig>  cm in diameter, respectively .figure  <dig>

doxorubicin -induced dose-dependent growth suppression, apoptosis, and caspase- <dig> activation in cmt cells
next, we investigated the susceptibility of the two cmt cell lines to dox. cells were treated with dox and cell growth and apoptosis were analyzed at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. we found that dox  was able to promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in dtk-e cells, but not in dtk-sme cells . further quantitative analysis revealed that 72-h exposures to  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm dox resulted in 2% and 58% mortality, respectively, in dtk-e cells . in addition, dox  treatment caused dna fragmentation in dtk-e cells at 72 h . in contrast, no dna fragmentation was observed at 72 h in dtk-sme cells. because activation of caspase- <dig> is a hallmark of apoptosis, we examined caspase- <dig> activation in dox-treated  cmt cells . dox induced the time-dependent cleavage of procaspase- <dig> into its active caspase- <dig> form in dtk-e cells, but not in dtk-sme cells.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study, we established and characterized two new cmt cell lines derived from a single malignant tumor: dtk-e and dtk-sme. dtk-e cells showed a large, flat, epithelial-like morphology, while dtk-sme cells showed a rounded epithelial-like morphology. both dtk-e and dtk-sme cells exhibited a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, which is often associated with malignancy in tumor cells. consistent with this finding, xenografts of injected dtk-e and dtk-sme cells developed into prominent solid tumors within 2 weeks, and the tumor mass of dtk-sme was larger than that of dtk-e after the 8-week study.

the human breast contains a branching ductal network composed of two epithelial cell types: an inner layer of polarized luminal epithelial cells and an outer layer of myoepithelial cells. breast cancer arises mainly in the luminal epithelial compartment of the terminal duct lobular units  <cit> . several proteins have been identified as important cell markers for investigating tumor pathophysiology. cytokeratins  are critical markers of epithelial differentiation  <cit> . the distribution of cks is tissue-specific, and this feature facilitates the determination of tumor origin . one low-molecular weight cytokeratin subtype, ck <dig>  is a marker of luminal epithelial cells in both human and canine mammary tissues  <cit> . in a study of  <dig> cases, expression of ck <dig> was associated with up to 96% of human breast epithelial neoplasms  <cit> . other studies have also reported a high incidence of ck <dig>  in canine mammary gland carcinomas  <cit> . in this study, we showed that dtk-e and dtk-sme expressed ck <dig> and possessed high tumorigenicity. these results suggest that the dtk-e and dtk-sme cell lines could have originated directly from the tumor cells in the surgical specimen.

vimentin is an intermediate filament protein expressed in mesenchymal cells  <cit> . vimentin expression in invasive breast carcinomas is generally considered to indicate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or myoepithelial histogenesis. vimentin-positive breast tumors have been described as mostly malignant, highly invasive, and chemoresistant  <cit> . interestingly, the dtk-e and dtk-sme cell lines established in this study were vimentin-positive and displayed tumorigenicity in mice.

hsp <dig> is a member of the small heat shock protein family of molecular chaperones. it plays an essential role in protein folding and protects cells from stress-induced damage  <cit> . in general, the healthy canine  mammary gland exhibits little or no hsp <dig> expression . in human breast cancer tumor cells, overexpression of hsp <dig> was associated with accelerated cancer progression  <cit> , increased anchorage-independent growth  <cit> , increased invasiveness  <cit> , and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs . in patients, elevated expression of hsp <dig> in human breast cancer tissues has been shown to indicate poor prognosis and a low survival rate  <cit> . therefore, increased expression of hsp <dig> in human breast cancers might affect the prognosis and treatment outcome  <cit> .

dox is an antitumor drug that can promote tumor cell apoptosis. currently, dox is widely used to treat a broad spectrum of cancers. in vitro studies of cancer cells have shown that hsp <dig> expression protects against apoptosis and confers resistance to dox  <cit> . interestingly, we also observed an association between increased hsp <dig> expression and resistance to dox . indeed, hsp <dig> expression was elevated in both the dtk-e and dtk-sme cell lines, although the expression level was higher in dtk-sme cells. accordingly, dtk-sme cells were more resistant to dox-mediated apoptosis and tumor masses were larger than those of dtk-e cells. the correlation between hsp <dig> and cmt malignancy currently remains unclear; thus, these two cmt cell lines with different tumorigenicities may serve as a valuable cell model for future studies of the roles of hsp <dig> in tumorigenicity and chemoresistance.

CONCLUSIONS
we established and characterized two new cmt cell lines with diverse tumorigenic properties. dtk-e cells were large, flat, and epithelial-like, while dtk-sme cells showed a rounded epithelial-like morphology and possessed pile up. both dtk-e and dtk-sme cells were vimentin+/ae1+/ck7+/hsp27+ and tumorigenic in nude mice. these two cell lines also exhibited differential susceptibility to dox-mediated apoptosis. based on their diverse malignancy, tumorigenicity, protein marker profiles, and drug susceptibility, these newly established cmt cell lines represent useful cell models for basic tumor biology studies and for developing antitumor drugs to treat both human and canine breast carcinomas.
