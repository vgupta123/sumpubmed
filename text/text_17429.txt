BACKGROUND
escherichia coli typically colonize the mammalian and avian gastrointestinal tract and other mucosal surfaces. while many of these strains are commensal, certain pathogenic strains have the ability to cause severe diseases  <cit> . extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  are a group of strains that are implicated in a large range of infections in humans and animals, such as neonatal meningitis, urinary tract infection, intra abdominal infection, pneumonia, osteomyelitis and septicaemia  <cit> . among the typical extraintestinal infections caused by expec in humans are urinary tract infections , which are a major public health concern in developed countries costing healthcare systems billions of dollars annually  <cit> . similarly, systemic infection caused by avian expec isolates  is an economically devastating disease to poultry industries  <cit> . apec enter and colonize the avian respiratory tract by inhalation of fecal dust leading to localized infections such as airsacculitis and pneumonia. in certain cases, they spread into various internal organs typically causing pericarditis, perihepatitis, peritonitis, salpingitis and other extraintestinal diseases. systemic infection of poultry is characterized in its acute form by septicemia, commonly resulting in sudden death  <cit> .

previous studies showed that certain subsets of expec strains isolated from different host organisms show high rates of similarity  <cit> , envisioning their zoonotic potential, which makes their intensive study even more important.

in general, single expec pathotypes show a high diversity due to differences in the set of virulence genes in their genomes as well as different phylogenetic backgrounds  <cit> . thus, unique virulence profiles shared by different human and animal expec pathotypes only rarely exist  <cit> .

although a high number of virulence factors has already been identified, the molecular basis of apec pathogenesis is not yet fully understood  <cit> . furthermore, with respect to the unavailability of vaccines eliciting an immune response towards all strains belonging to the highly diverse apec group, it would be of special importance to identify such virulence factors, which could at the same time, serve as good vaccine candidates. adhesins, e. g., are known to represent well established targets for the development of vaccines against a number of infectious diseases  <cit> . among these bacterial proteins with adhesive properties are autotransporter adhesins, forming a large and diverse family. however, in principal, all members of this family share conserved structural features, that is  a secretion signal for the sec pathway in the n-terminus,  a conserved c-terminal translocation domain inserting into the outer membrane of the bacterial cell, and  a variable internal functional passenger domain, which is translocated to the bacterial surface  <cit> . this process is also known as type v secretion pathway which can involve two proteins, namely a transport and a secreted protein or, as it is the case for autotransporter adhesins, only one protein with dual function  <cit> . more than  <dig> members of the autotransporter family are known  <cit>  exhibiting very diverse functions conferred by their surface-exposed passenger domains. they can be involved in proteolysis, cytotoxicity, serum resistance, cell-to-cell spread, autoaggregation, biofilm formation, invasion, and adhesion  <cit> .

our work focuses on apec strain imt <dig> and its natural interaction with the chicken host, particularly concentrating on the identification of novel adhesins, conferring the primary and most vital step in the pathogen-host interaction  <cit> . to further unravel factors possibly involved in apec pathogenicity, suppression subtractive hybridization was applied to the genome of apec strain imt <dig> and human upec strain cft <dig>  both allocated to different multilocus sequence type complexes, leading to the identification of the putative apec autotransporter adhesin gene aata. a 98% identical gene was also found in strain apec_o <dig> by li and co-authors only recently  <cit> . the respective gene aata and its localization in the imt <dig> genome was analyzed and compared with similar loci present in sequenced e. coli genomes. to verify the functional role of the putative adhesin in vitro adhesion assays were performed using df- <dig> chicken fibroblast cells. in addition, a representative collection of expec and commensal e. coli strains from different hosts and phylogenetic groups was screened for the presence of the adhesin gene to determine whether it is associated with specific pathotypes or phylogenetic groups.

RESULTS
identification of genes present in apec strain imt <dig> but absent in human upec strain cft073
the aim of the work presented here was to identify new potential virulence genes specific for avian pathogenic e. coli  strains, which might be important in the pathogenesis of systemic infections in poultry and helpful in delineating this pathotype from other expec pathotypes. by applying suppression subtractive hybridization  to apec strain imt <dig> and human expec strain cft <dig>   <dig> clones were obtained from the not yet sequenced apec strain imt <dig> which were not present in the archetypical upec strain cft <dig>  these  <dig> clones were amplified by pcr and cloned into plasmid pcr <dig> . to explore the specificity of these gene fragments for apec strain imt <dig>  pcr amplicons were transferred to a nylon membrane and southern hybridization analysis was performed with labelled genomic dna of upec strain cft <dig> and k- <dig> strain mg <dig>  respectively. among the  <dig> clones,  <dig> contained an insert neither hybridizing with the labelled genomic dna of cft <dig> nor with that of k- <dig> strain mg <dig>  thus, a total of  <dig> dna fragments supposed to be specific for imt <dig> were sequenced . subsequent blast analyses revealed that  <dig> dna fragments, ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp in size, were indeed absent from the genome of cft <dig> and k- <dig> strain mg <dig> and were regarded as specific for apec strain imt <dig> in the experimental approach. sequences of the identified loci and their corresponding products, respectively, show similarities to bacteriophages; ents/ybda mfs transporter proteins, conjugal transfer proteins; restriction modification enzymes and different biosynthesis enzymes, e.g. a polysialic acid biosynthesis protein, a poly-alpha- <dig>  sialosyl sialyltransferase, a phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, a dtdp-rhamnosyl transferase and a glycosyltransferase. nine of the identified fragments were similar to sequences encoding proteins of unknown function.

one of the ssh fragments  was of special interest to us, as its potential product showed sequence similarity to proteins of the family of bacterial autotransporter adhesins, including a putative adhesin gene located on papec-o1-colbm plasmid, which at the time of our analysis, was not described in detail. our further analyses focused on this gene. a  <dig>  bp sequence of imt <dig> containing the open reading frame and the flanking regions of the gene was submitted to genbank . according to the nucleotide sequence similarity of 98% to the previously described adhesin gene aata , which is located on plasmid papec-o1-colbm  <cit> , we adopted the name and focussed our further study on a detailed characterization of imt <dig> aata.

sequence analysis of the autotransporter adhesin gene aata
to determine the complete sequence of aata and its flanking region we generated a cosmid library of apec strain imt <dig>  this library was screened by pcr using three different oligonucleotide pairs . after identification of the e. coli clone containing a cosmid with the aata sequence, the cosmid dna was isolated and sequenced. double strand sequence information was obtained for the complete predicted open reading frame  of aata  and  <dig>  additional nucleotides of the surrounding region. megablastn analyses revealed a 98% sequence identity of this orf with a coding sequence from e. coli apec_o <dig> . in addition, homologues were also found in e. coli strain bl <dig>  and e. coli strain b_rel <dig>  showing a 99% identity to aata. the coverage for the  <dig> to 99% identical region was 100% in bl <dig>  b_rel <dig>  and apec_o <dig>  respectively. figure 1a gives an overview of the genomic locus of imt <dig> containing the aata orf. figure  <dig> shows the comparison of the  <dig>  bp genome regions of the strains containing aata. the schematic view of the genome loci reflects similarities and differences among the sequenced e. coli strains harbouring aata. as illustrated in this figure, the orf of the adhesin gene is conserved among imt <dig>  apec_o <dig>  bl <dig>  and b_rel <dig>  whereas the surrounding regions differ, except for bl <dig> and b_rel <dig> which show 100% identity in this region. further analysis of the sequences up- and downstream of aata showed that in the strains mentioned above the 5' as well as the 3' flanking regions encode mobile elements . among these are sequences similar to insertion sequence is <dig> and is <dig> in the 5' flanking region of aata and genes coding for insertion sequences is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> in the 3' flanking region, respectively. the presence of genes encoding transposases in all four strains suggests that aata has been acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

sequence analyses also revealed that aata is likely to be a single gene locus and not part of an operon. this is in accordance with data of other autotransporter adhesins  <cit> . promoter prediction analysis with  <dig> bp upstream of the atg showed two possible transcriptional start sites at position - <dig>  and - <dig>  relative to the atg of the aata orf in imt <dig>  this  <dig> bp region is almost identical in apec_o <dig> . the most likely transcriptional start site is predicted at position - <dig>  relative to the atg of the aata orf. the  <dig> bp region upstream of aata in strains bl <dig> and b_rel <dig> shows only 70% identity to the respective region in apec strain imt <dig>  a possible transcriptional start site was predicted at position - <dig>  relative to the atg. expression analyses in later studies showed that the promoter of the imt <dig> aata lies within the  <dig> bp upstream of the orf .

aata is plasmid-encoded in apec_o <dig> but not in apec strain imt5155
although apec strains apec_o <dig> and imt <dig>  both assigned to multi locus sequence type complex   <dig>  are closely related the surrounding regions of aata significantly differ in these strains. the genome sequence of apec_o <dig> reveals that the aata homolog in this strain is located on the  <dig>  bp papec-o1-colbm plasmid, downstream of the eitabcd operon  <cit> . sequence analysis of the imt <dig> colv plasmid p1colv <dig>  as well as of the second imt <dig> plasmid p <dig>   showed that aata is not plasmid-located in imt <dig> 

aata encodes a protein with features of an autotransporter
blastx analyses with the imt <dig> aata orf revealed that the potential aata protein comprises a signal peptide at the n-terminus as predicted with the signalp  <dig>  server; an autotransporter repeat conserved among autotransporter adhesins from different bacterial species; a passenger domain and a c-terminal translocation domain . according to these data, aata likely encodes an adhesin of the autotransporter family.

thus, the relation of this protein to other autotransporter family members was further investigated. clustalw http://align.genome.jp/ analyses were performed with  <dig> protein sequences from already known adhesins of the autotransporter family including proteins from e. coli, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, yersinia enterocolitica, moraxella catarrhalis, helicobacter pylori, xylella fastidiosa, salmonella typhimurium, bordetella pertussis and the newly identified e. coli imt <dig> adhesin aata . protein sequences were obtained from the ncbi database and the respective accession numbers are given in figure  <dig>  the results presented as phylogenetic tree  show that aata clusters within one group together with aida-i , tiba  and ag <dig>  from e. coli, which are closely related to shda  from salmonella and pertactin from bordetella. we also investigated the  <dig> adhesins including only their last  <dig> amino acid residues according to the smallest protein hada to circumvent false results due to different protein lengths. the results were comparable to those of the analyses of the complete protein sequences. similarly, comparing only the c-termini, aida-i clusters in one phylogenetic branch with aata, thus the c-terminus of aata seems to be most related to that of aida-i . the amino acid residue alignment of the c-termini of aida-i and aata revealed a number of identical residues as shown in figure 3c. comparing only the c-terminus one has to keep in mind that this part contains the transmembrane domain to span the bacterial membrane, thus it is likely to be the most conserved part among all autotransporter adhesins.

we also examined the amino acid differences of the conserved aata proteins in e. coli imt <dig>  apec_o <dig> and bl <dig> and b_rel <dig>  respectively. the aata of the latter two strains are 100% identical. in total,  <dig> amino acid substitutions were found in the c-terminus containing the transmembrane domain;  <dig> variable positions lie within the passenger domain and  <dig> differences in amino acid sequence were found in the n-termini of the aata proteins . interestingly, the transmembrane domains of bl <dig> and imt <dig> are 100% identical and the  <dig> c-terminal amino acid differences occur in apec_o <dig> compared to these two strains. also the majority of amino acid substitutions within the n-terminus  occur in apec_o <dig> in contrast to the almost identical aata proteins from bl <dig> and imt <dig> . taken together, the adhesins of the two apec strains differ more than the aata proteins of imt <dig> and the non-pathogenic bl <dig> strain. it is notable that most differences are present in the c-terminus which forms a pore through the membrane and is thus functionally conserved whereas the passenger domains are known to be variable among the autotransporter adhesin family members.

aata is expressed in apec imt5155
to determine whether aata is transcribed in wild-type strain imt <dig> under laboratory conditions, its expression was studied by quantitative real-time pcr including aata-negative upec strain cft <dig> and aata-positive strains bl <dig> and apec_o <dig>  expression of aata was detectable in all aata-positive strains after growth in lb. interestingly, our analysis revealed different transcriptional levels of aata in imt <dig>  apec_o <dig> and bl <dig> when compared to the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene gyrb. in detail, we observed an increased transcription of aata in apec_o <dig> , while bl <dig> showed a considerable lower transcription level of this gene  as compared with the transcription level determined for aata in imt <dig>  as expected no specific transcription was detected for aata in cft <dig> .

aata triggers antibody production in rabbits
to investigate if the aata transcript in imt <dig> is indeed translated into the expected aata protein, a specific antibody against aata was raised.

for the production of specific aata antibodies we cloned the internal part of aata  into expression vector pet32a under the control of the iptg-inducible t <dig> promoter . the resulting construct led to the expression of a 64-kda fusion protein in e. coli bl <dig> designated aataf . figure  <dig> shows a coomassie stained sds-page, demonstrating that aataf was well expressed in e. coli bl <dig> after induction with iptg  and successfully purified using the histrap column . the purified protein was then used to produce specific aata antibodies as described in methods.

to confirm that the produced antibody is specific and able to recognize not only the fusion protein aataf but also the native wild-type protein aata, total protein extract of the strain bl <dig> prior and after induction of the iptg-inducible promoter as well as the purified fusion protein aataf and total protein extracts of strains imt <dig>  apec_o <dig>  cft <dig> and mg <dig> were separated on an sds gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. as shown in figure  <dig> incubation with anti-aata indeed led to the detection of protein bands of the expected size for aataf in the total extract of bl <dig> and wild-type aata protein in apec strains imt <dig> and apec_o <dig>  respectively. as expected, no signal was observed for cft <dig> and mg <dig>  which have no aata homolog in their genomes. taken together our data show that aata is suitable for the production of specific antibodies. furthermore, this antibody recognizes wild-type aata protein, demonstrating that apec strains imt <dig> and apec_o <dig> express a protein of the expected size, thus the gene in their genomes is likely to encode a functional adhesin. surprisingly, no band of the expected size for aata was detectable in strain bl <dig>  which might be due to several reasons, including the lower transcription of the gene in this strain probably due to the presence of the different promoter region as compared to the apec_o <dig> and imt <dig> aata promoter regions.

expression of aata in the fim negative e. coli strain aaec <dig> leads to enhanced adhesion abilities
based on sequence analyses it was assumed that also the chromosomal aata variant encodes a protein with adhesive function. to verify this, adhesion assays were performed using the chicken embryo fibroblast cell line df- <dig>  for this, aata was expressed under control of its native promoter in e. coli strain aaec <dig>  aaec <dig> is an mg <dig> strain in which the fim operon is deleted leading to a reduced adhesion in in vitro assays  <cit> . aaec <dig> and the control strain aaec <dig> were incubated with df- <dig> cells for  <dig> h. as shown in figure 7a, the aata containing strain displayed a  <dig>  fold increase in adherence as compared to the adhesion of the negative control . this suggests that aata mediates adhesion of e. coli cells to chicken cells. to prove that aata is indeed expressed, total extracts of aaec <dig> and aaec <dig> were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-aata antibody. as shown in figure  <dig>  a specific protein band appears for strain aaec <dig>  which has the expected size of aata. taken together, our data demonstrate that aaec <dig> expresses aata wild-type protein, which leads to enhanced adhesion of aaec <dig>  thus, we can assume a role of aata in adhesion of e. coli to chicken cells. furthermore, our data show that the aata promoter lies within the  <dig> bp upstream of the gene.

aata is involved in adhesion of apec strain imt5155
in order to investigate the role of aata in adhesion of the wild-type apec strain imt <dig> we have chosen an adhesion inhibition approach using specific anti-aata antibody for pre-treatment of bacteria prior to incubation with df- <dig> cells. bacteria pre-treated with pre-immune serum served as control. as shown in figure 7b the anti-aata antibody slightly reduced e. coli imt <dig> adherence to df- <dig> cells, which indicates that aata might play a role in adhesion of imt <dig> to eukaryotic cells. however, the difference is rather low. this observation is probably due to the number of other adhesins present in imt <dig>  which are not blocked by the anti-aata antibody and thus are still able to mediate adhesion.

in a second complementary adhesion inhibition approach df- <dig> cells were pre-incubated with purified and refolded aataf protein and with bsa as negative control, respectively, prior to the adhesion assay. bacterial cells, which adhered to the pre-treated df- <dig> cells, were harvested and the number of adherent bacteria was determined. as shown in figure 7c, the incubation of df- <dig> cells with aataf led to a reduction in adhesion of imt <dig> as compared to cells pre-incubated with bsa. as described above, imt <dig> expresses aata under the growth conditions used for adhesion assays. in conclusion, our results indicate that aata plays a role in adhesion of imt <dig> to chicken cells.

distribution of aata among  <dig> expec isolates with regard to pathotype, host, and ecor group
out of a total of  <dig> e. coli tested,  <dig> isolates  were found to be positive for aata . turning our attention to apec strains, we found that  <dig> % of  <dig> isolates harboured aata , while the gene was less frequently observed among upec  and other expec  isolates and completely absent in nmec strains. interestingly, a high percentage  of commensal strains, in particular of avian sources  was positive for aata. taking a closer look at the association of the host and the presence of aata in expec strains, we observed that  <dig> %  of avian strains harboured the gene, accounting for  <dig> % of all  <dig> aata positive strains. essentially minor percentages of aata-positive strains were recovered from companion animals  and humans , while among various non-avian hosts, only pigs and cattle also infrequently possessed aata . statistical analyses confirmed a positive correlation of aata-possessing strains to birds and a negative correlation to strains from humans and companion animals .

although aata was detected in strains of all major phylogenetic groups, the highest percentage of positive strains was observed in ecor group d  and in descending order in groups b <dig> , a , and b <dig>  . the frequent presence of aata-positive strains within ecor group d is even more remarkable if we merely consider avian strains, whether pathogenic or not. among  <dig> strains from birds,  <dig> %  group d strains were aata-positive, while a lower percentage was calculated for groups a , b <dig> , and b <dig> .

to get an idea about the distribution of the three different aata "variants" as determined by the variable flanking regions observed by sequencing and in silico analyses, a set of  <dig> aata-positive strains were analysed by three pcrs using primers specifically binding to the internal part of aata and to the respective flanking genes feci , ykgn , and eitd , the latter one likely reflecting a plasmid localization of aata in the respective positive strains. most of the strains tested harboured aata-flanking variant  <dig>  and variant  <dig> , both putatively resembling a chromosomal location of aata in these strains. on the contrary, the apec_o <dig> episomal variant  <dig> was only observed in  <dig> % of the strains. more than 50% of the strains were negative for all three variants tested, indicating the presence of yet other regions flanking the aata gene, which remain to be determined.

discussion
the pathogenesis of e. coli is a multifactorial process depending on a variety of pathogenicity factors. a vast amount of already known and still unknown virulence determinants defines the virulence of a certain strain and thus the strength of the disease symptoms induced in the corresponding host organism. although recent studies revealed considerable intersection between expec pathotypes in general, the set of virulence genes present in pathogenic strains can differ considerably in terms of number and combination of genes  <cit> . thus, the identification and characterization of additional virulence associated factors would still improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity and virulence of a certain group of e. coli strains.

making use of two clinical strains, namely imt <dig> and cft <dig>  which differ with respect to host , pathotype , o-type , and multilocus sequence type  in an ssh approach we identified an e. coli adhesin of the autotransporter family. the method of ssh enabled us to determine genes of the so far not sequenced apec strain imt <dig> representing a well studied prototype strain isolated from a chicken in a german poultry flock which had experienced a severe outbreak of systemic e. coli infection  <cit> . at the beginning of our studies, no sequence information was available for any apec strain. thus, ssh promised to be a useful tool to achieve sequence information about specific genes present in the avian pathogen but not in the human uti strain albeit both being expec strains. indeed ssh has successfully been used in the past in many aspects, including the identification of virulence genes  <cit> .

among  <dig> dna fragments that were specific for imt <dig> in our ssh approach, a  <dig> bp fragment, which showed similarity to putative adhesins, attracted our attention. although in the run of our experiments a 98% identical adhesin gene as well as the functional role of its product in vitro and in vivo have been published by li and colleagues  <cit> , we still considered it important to complete our data as we observed some essential differences to the mentioned study.

adhesins are involved in the first step of infection, allowing the primary and intimate contact of the pathogen with its host cell, initiating a pathogenic cascade. their localization at the bacterial surface and their supposed function for enhanced gut colonization in terms of an intestinal reservoir make adhesins attractive candidates for vaccine developmental strategies  <cit> .

apec strain imt <dig> harbours the fim genes for the type  <dig> fimbriae, csg genes for curli fibers and the temperature-sensitive haemagglutinin  gene  <cit> . it is interesting that imt <dig> lacks p, f1c, s and dr fimbriae, known to be specifically involved in upec pathogenesis  <cit> . thus, other, so far unidentified adhesins might play a role in imt <dig> pathogenesis. indeed, we recently identified the yqi gene cluster encoding a fimbrial type of adhesin, called ea/i, that has been shown to confer an adhesive phenotype to a fim negative k- <dig> strain  <cit> . our data presented here show that autotransporter adhesin aata might also play a certain role in the pathogenesis of apec infections. in fact, few autotransporter type adhesins have been shown to be involved in apec virulence to date. in  <dig>  tsh which confers agglutination of chicken erythrocytes, was identified in apec strain χ <dig>  <cit> . later, dozois and co-workers showed that tsh probably contributes to the development of air sac lesions in birds  <cit> . furthermore, it turned out that the vacuolating autotransporter toxin vat, identified in apec strain ec <dig> for the first time, was involved in the development of cellulitis in broiler chickens  <cit> . comparable to tsh and vat, aata of apec imt <dig> comprises all structural motifs characteristic for members of the family of autotransporter proteins: a signal peptide at the n-terminus, which would be recognized by the sec secretion machinery; an autotransporter repeat, a passenger domain and a c-terminal translocation domain were predicted.

adherence inhibition assay with a fusion protein containing the central part of the aata protein confirmed the adhesive properties of aata. this central part comprises the passenger domain, which is the secreted and surface-exposed protein part and thus the protein domain with supposed virulence function. while the translocation domain is highly conserved, the passenger domain demonstrates considerable sequence variation  <cit>  making it a good candidate to gain specific antibodies against aata.

by quantitative real-time pcr and immunoblot assays we could show that imt <dig> and apec_o <dig> wildtype aata are expressed under lab conditions, which stands in contrast to what li et al.  stated for apec_o <dig> in their recent publication  <cit> . these contradictory observations might in part be explained by different procedures used for antibody production, which could have led to a better detection of the aata wild-type protein in our study. the failure to detect the very similar bl21-aata protein with our antibody could be due to the low transcript level as indicated by qpcr experiments. lower transcription might in turn have occurred due to sequence changes in the promoter regions in front of the imt <dig> and bl <dig> aata orfs, which in fact show only 70% identity. adhesion assays with the fim negative strain aaec <dig> expressing the imt <dig> aata confirmed not only the adhesive properties for aata but also the functionality of the predicted native promoter region. in addition, adhesion inhibition assays indicated a role for aata as adhesin for imt <dig>  which substantiates the findings of li et al.  <cit>  and indicates that the location of aata, either on a plasmid or on the chromosome, does not seem to have any influence on the function of the adhesin, which has to be further investigated in the future.

the ability of bacteria to adhere to a diverse range of surfaces including different host tissues and abiotic elements is essential for colonization, survival and persistence  <cit> . this is demonstrated by the enormous number of different adhesins known so far. it is assumed that a bacterial cell has such a huge set of diverse adhesive proteins to be able to adhere to different tissues and surfaces  <cit> . indeed the results of our adhesion inhibition assays supported this idea as blocking of imt <dig> and of df- <dig> cells did not have a relevant effect on the adhesion property, showing that other adhesins are still effectively mediating adhesion.

an involvement of aata in adhesion does not necessarily predict its vital importance for the virulence of a strain in vivo. however virulence, in particular with regard to expec strains, is often a result of the interplay of several factors, with adhesion-related factors representing one of the most essential groups. here, a number of adhesins are involved making it difficult to assess the contribution of one single adhesin to disease symptoms. however, for the 98% identical aata of apec_o <dig> its contribution to full virulence in chicken was shown  <cit> .

one simple view is that one adhesin specifically mediates the adhesion to one specific receptor on the eukaryotic cell. this assumption led to the question if aata isolated from apec imt <dig>  which enters the chicken via the respiratory tract, specifically recognizes proteins of the avian trachea and lung tissue. interestingly, deduced from the amino acid sequence, aata clustered together with pertactin from b. pertussis, an adhesin which mediates binding to the lung epithelium of mammals . as this is just a presumptive sequence-based finding, the identification of the host tissue receptor and its interaction with aata has to be explored in future studies.

a number of publications claim that autotransporter adhesins are of special interest as they constitute an essential component of vaccines used in the medical area  <cit> . pertactin from bordetella pertussis was the first autotransporter adhesin used as a vaccine  <cit> . also for hap from h. influenzae elicitation of specific antibody titres was shown in mice  <cit> . indeed, new classes of these drugs are needed because of the increasing incidence of pathogenic organisms resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents; and it is believed that strains with genotypic resistance to the anti-adhesion agents will spread much slower than strains resistant to conventional drugs, such as antimicrobial substances  <cit> . here, we show that specific antibodies can be produced against aata. furthermore, we performed prevalence studies to verify if aata fulfils criteria to serve as vaccine component from an epidemiological point of view. in contrast to the previously described novel adhesin gene yqi, initially identified in apec strain imt <dig>  <cit> , aata was significantly associated with avian isolates, in that more than 90% of all positively tested strains were apec and avian commensal strains, respectively, which is in accordance with the findings of li et al.  <cit> . envisioning an intestinal prevention strategy that aims to combat pathogenic strains from colonizing the proposed intestinal reservoir, the frequent presence of aata in avian commensal strains would basically contradict this idea, as the biological function of the physiological microbiota, including that of non-pathogenic e. coli strains, should not be diminished by such a vaccine. however, a high percentage of aata positive strains was allocated to phylogenetic groups b <dig> and d. avian commensal strains belonging to these groups have recently been shown to harbour an essential set of virulence genes and to be pathogenic for chickens  <cit> . thus, they represent pathogenic strains residing in the chicken intestine rather than fulfilling the criteria of non-pathogenic strains. in conclusion, aata might not only be relevant to the adhesion of the upper respiratory tract of birds and subsequent pathogenic processes but seems to promote intestinal colonization, thereby contributing to the maintenance and transmission of pathogenic strains. a similar situation could be imagined for aata positive e. coli strain b_rel <dig> that has been isolated from the human gut, but to our knowledge has not undergone further characterization in terms of potential extraintestinal virulence so far.

li and colleagues found a significant association of aata with isolates assigned to phylogenetic group d with 70% of apec strains from this phylogenetic group being aata-positive, and more than half of all aata-positive strains belonging to phylogenetic group d  <cit> . we observed a similar situation among our strain collection, while a distinction between different aata-flanking region variants revealed that variant  <dig>  was more frequently observed in group b <dig> and d strains and variant  <dig>  in group a and d strains, while, although only rarely detected, the presumed episomal aata variant  <dig>  was linked with group b <dig> strains. further large-scale analysis will have to rule out, whether the distribution of different aata-flanking variants may be influenced by the phylogenetic background of the strains or by selective forces driven by environmental conditions, e.g. given in a certain host compartment.

the overall wide distribution of this supposed virulence associated gene in a large range of expec and commensal isolates is indicative for a horizontal transfer of aata. it is well established that virulence factors are often located on mobile elements, such as plasmids or pathogenicity islands and are thus often subjected to horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . sequence analyses of aata and the flanking regions revealed a potential of mobility for the adhesin gene. in all completely sequenced e. coli genomes, where an aata sequence was detected, the gene locus was enclosed by transposable elements. furthermore, episomally located aata variants might be transferred in the context of the whole plasmid, presuming the presence of functional transfer and mobility elements.

in addition, possible sequence variations among aata genes of strains allocated to different phylogenetic groups might be reflected functionally, which has for example been shown for the genes of the fim cluster  <cit> . since aata was retained in isolates of different phylogenetic groups, the discrete function of the protein in the respective strains, whether they commensally colonize the intestine or invade other internal organs of poultry and cause severe systemic infections, remains unsolved to date and should be subjected to thorough investigations in the future.

many autotransporter adhesins are known to be relevant not only for adhesion but also for biofilm formation, invasion, aggregation and toxicity  <cit> . adhesins related to aata, such as hap, ag <dig>  aida and tiba, for example, contribute to bacterial aggregation by intercellular passenger domain interactions  <cit> . most trimeric autotransporter adhesins also seem to confer serum resistance by binding to components of the complement system  <cit> . although imt <dig> does not produce a biofilm under normal lab conditions, it remains to be determined if in vivo conditions might probably trigger this phenotype, enabling to investigate a possible role of aata in this process. although li et al. suggested that aata is not involved in autoaggregation or biofilm formation  <cit> , it did not become evident whether they tested the wild-type and mutant strain, observing no difference, or whether the wild-type strain apec_o <dig>  comparable to imt <dig>  did not show these phenotypes in general.

CONCLUSIONS
a chromosomal variant of the autotransporter adhesin gene aata, which has recently been described in the plasmid papec-o1-colbm of apec_o <dig>  <cit>  was identified in apec strain imt <dig>  the gene product conferred adhesion of a fim-negative k- <dig> strain to df- <dig> cells and its passenger domain was able to trigger immune responses in rabbits. prevalence studies clearly hinted towards a special importance of this adhesin in avian pathogenic e. coli strains, whether outbreak or so-called reservoir strains, while an essential functional role for other animal and human expec strains cannot be inferred from the present data. different flanking regions as well as mobility elements indicate a high frequency of horizontal gene transfer of aata, the driving forces which have yet to be determined.
