BACKGROUND
sox <dig> is a central player in animal development and one of only a few factors that together can initiate the formation of pluripotent cells  from somatic cell populations
 <cit> . this reflects its central role as a ‘node’ in the gene regulatory network that controls embryonic stem cell biology, promoting stem cell self-renewal and inhibiting differentiation. sox <dig> is also one of the first genes to be active in the neural ectoderm and its expression is maintained in proliferating neural stem cells  of the cns throughout development and in the mature brain
 <cit> . the expression of sox <dig> in these cells again seems to be associated with their self-renewal and inhibition of differentiation
 <cit> . sox <dig> is generally regarded as a transcriptional activator. however, in recent studies analysing the global response of cells to loss of sox <dig> activity, the expression of many genes was seen to increase rapidly when sox <dig> function was inhibited
 <cit> . chip-seq analysis shows that several of the genes affected in these studies are directly bound by sox <dig>  implying that they are direct targets
. given the central role of sox <dig> in the biology of both es cells and nscs, the possibility that it might also possess such a major alternative mechanism of action is of great interest. we therefore set out to determine to what extent sox <dig> represses genes in nscs. using an expression array approach, we found that sox <dig> repressed approximately as many genes as it activated in nscs.

we also investigated the mechanism by which sox <dig> might achieve transcriptional repression. tcf and lef are closely related to the sox gene family. these factors can act as either transcriptional activators or repressors. like many other transcriptional repressors, these proteins achieve this effect by recruiting members of the groucho-related gene  family of co-repressors
 <cit> . we considered this to be a likely route for the repressor activity of sox <dig> 

we found that sox <dig> can indeed interact with grg proteins and a mutation disrupting interaction between sox <dig> and the grgs resulted in loss of the ability of sox <dig> to repress expression from the gfap promoter whilst its ability to activate other promoters remained intact. we also found that, unlike wild type  sox <dig>  the mutant version of sox <dig> was unable to repress neuronal differentiation when overexpressed. this suggests a new model for the mechanisms by which sox <dig> regulates nsc biology.

RESULTS
elucidating the target genes of sox <dig> repression
in order to ascertain the extent to which sox <dig> activates and represses genes in nscs, we carried out gene expression microarray analysis. human nscs were transfected with expression constructs encoding egfp alone, or together with wt sox <dig>  after 14 hours in culture, egfp-expressing cells were isolated by facs and rna extracted for analysis using affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  chips .figure  <dig>

rt-qpcr revealed that the level of sox <dig> overexpression was approximately  <dig> fold greater than endogenous sox <dig> and expression of the endogenous sox <dig> gene was unaffected in transfected cells. . among the genes that were affected by sox <dig> , the number exhibiting repressed probe sets  was almost the same as the number activated  . these numbers are strikingly similar to the number of genes whose expression increased  or decreased  > <dig>  fold when sox <dig> expression was lost  in es cells .

comparison of the genes activated by sox <dig> to those repressed revealed a striking difference. according to their gene ontology  terms  genes that were activated by sox <dig> were highly enriched for those listed under terms related to regulating transcription . most of these represent transcription factors. remarkably, the list of genes repressed by sox <dig>  included no terms in these same go term categories. by contrast, among the genes repressed by sox <dig>  there was very strong enrichment for genes associated with the cell cycle and mitosis, including spindle organization and dna replication and repair. such a dramatic difference in the classes of gene activated or repressed by sox <dig> provides additional assurance that the genes identified are a non-random selection of the genes on the array.

previous studies in which sox <dig> was knocked down were carried out in es cells and so would not be expected to share much in common with our experiments in nscs. however, comparison between these data revealed a small proportion of the genes identified as repressed by sox <dig> in our study that were also repressed by sox <dig> in es cells. some of these genes have also been shown to be bound by sox <dig> by chipseq  .

sox <dig> interacts with grg proteins
other hmg domain factors have been shown to interact with the grg family of co-repressors
 <cit> . therefore, in order to determine if this might also be a potential mechanism by which sox <dig> could act as a transcriptional repressor, we used two assays. first, we determined if sox <dig> could alter the subcellular localization of grg proteins. there are five grg genes in vertebrates; grg1- <dig> are long forms and grg  <dig> is equivalent to only the n-terminal half of those long forms. we analysed grg <dig> and grg <dig> as a representative full length grg protein. when transfected into cos- <dig> cells, grg <dig> forms nuclear bodies, grg <dig> is seen in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and sox <dig> exhibits diffuse staining restricted to the nucleus . when co-transfected with sox <dig>  both grg <dig> and grg <dig> adopted exclusively diffuse nuclear staining matching the distribution of sox <dig>  suggesting an interaction between sox <dig> and grgs . in a second assay, co-immunoprecipitation was carried out using human nscs,  transfected with myc-tagged grgs. this showed that endogenous sox <dig> was co-precipitated with the myc-tagged grg <dig> and grg <dig> implying that they exist in a protein complex .figure  <dig>

grgs affect sox <dig> function
to determine if grgs affect the transcriptional regulation activity of sox <dig>  luciferase reporter assays were carried out using several promoter sequences. co-transfection of cos- <dig> cells with sox <dig> resulted in a twofold increase in luciferase expression from a ‘generic’ sox promoter  and a 25-fold increase when the luciferase gene was under the control of the rex gene proximal promoter element, a known target of sox2
 <cit> . when grg <dig> or grg <dig> constructs were also transfected alongside sox <dig>  these increases in luciferase activity were almost completely abrogated or severely reduced . according to cavellaro et al.
 <cit> , expression of the gfap gene is directly repressed by sox <dig>  here, we confirmed this in p <dig> ec cells, in which the basal level of luciferase activity was significantly repressed by co-transfected sox <dig> . this repression was even greater in the presence of co-transfected grg <dig> or grg <dig> , where transfection of the same amount of grg <dig> or grg <dig> alone had no significant effect on the luciferase expression .figure  <dig> 
grgs repress sox <dig> transcriptional activation activity. co-transfected sox <dig> caused an approximately 2-fold increase in luciferase activity from the 3xsx promoter  or 25-fold increase from the rex promoter  in cos- <dig> cells, but this increase was significantly inhibited when grg <dig> or grg <dig> were co-transfected .  co-expression of sox <dig> with the gfap-luciferase reporter construct in p <dig> cells caused a 2-fold decrease in luciferase activity compared to vector alone and the presence of either grg <dig> or grg <dig> increased this repression .  cotransfected grg <dig> or grg <dig> caused no significant difference from controls  in luciferase activity from various promoters in p <dig> cells. *p = < <dig> ; **p = < <dig> .



mapping the grg interaction domain in sox2
we designed six c-terminal deletions of sox <dig>  and tested their ability to interact with grgs . the subcellular translocation assay with grg <dig> indicated that the c-terminal amino acids between  <dig> and  <dig> were essential for the interaction . we therefore set out to generate a site-directed mutant that no longer bound grgs, but would retain transcriptional activator activity.figure  <dig>

loss of grg interaction in a 203– <dig> mutant
comparison between sox <dig> and the other soxb <dig> members and between sox <dig> orthologues from different species revealed that only four amino acids were conserved in the region from position 203– <dig>  we therefore made a mutant, referred to as sox2m203– <dig>  in which these four amino acids were altered . although this mutant still located to the nucleus , in the subcellular translocation assay, the sox2m203– <dig> mutant exhibited a dramatically reduced ability to change the subcellular localization of grg <dig> . moreover, unlike wt sox <dig>  immune precipitation of myc-grg <dig> in cos- <dig> cells did not co-precipitate co-transfected sox2m203– <dig> mutant . in order to determine whether this mutation had disrupted a direct protein-protein interaction between the grg proteins and sox <dig> an in vitro pull down assay was used. the ability of gst-fused grg <dig> or grg <dig> proteins to pull down radiolabelled sox <dig> or sox2m203– <dig> was assessed. for both grg proteins, the sox2m203– <dig> mutant resulted in a similar 4-fold decrease in the amount of sox <dig> that was co-immune precipitated . it was also noted that grg <dig> was able to pull down approximately 4-fold more sox <dig> than did grg <dig> . these data show that residues 203– <dig> of the sox <dig> protein are necessary for a direct interaction with both grg <dig> and grg <dig> figure  <dig>

mutant does not interact with grgs and fails to repress a reporter construct.  unlike wt sox <dig>  the sox <dig> m203– <dig> mutant was unable to translocate grg <dig> into the nucleus of co-transfected cos- <dig> cells suggesting loss of interaction. counting the proportion of cells exhibiting altered distribution of myc-grg in cells co-expressing sox <dig> revealed a highly significant reduction of about 50% .  immune precipitation of myc-grg <dig> co-transfected with wt sox <dig> or with the sox <dig> m203– <dig> mutant, showing that the mutant failed to be co-precipitated with grg <dig>   in an in vitro pull down assay, immunoprecipitation of gst-fused grg <dig> or grg <dig> reproducibly pulled-down 4– <dig> fold less sox <dig> m203– <dig> than it did wt sox <dig>  the sox <dig> m203– <dig> mutant retained the ability to activate luciferase expression driven by the 3xsx promoter in cos- <dig> cells .  the ability of co-transfected sox <dig> m203– <dig> mutant to induce luciferase expression driven by the rex promoter in p <dig> cells was very similar to that induced by wt sox <dig>   unlike wt sox <dig>  the sox <dig> m203– <dig> mutant failed to repress luciferase expression driven from the gfap promoter, and the addition of grg <dig> or grg <dig> had no effect on this. *p = < <dig> ; **p = < <dig> ; ns – not significant scale bar approximately 20 μm.



the sox2m203– <dig> mutant loses repressor activity
having established that amino acids 203– <dig> were required for grg binding, we next asked whether sox2m203– <dig> was defective in its ability to act as a gene repressor. using the luciferase reporter assay described above, we found that the sox2m203– <dig> mutant retained the ability to activate both the 3xsx and the rex-regulated reporter constructs , indeed having a slightly stronger activator effect on the 3xsx promoter than wt sox <dig>  however, the mutant no longer significantly repressed luciferase expression of the construct driven from the gfap promoter even in the presence of ectopic grg <dig> or grg <dig> . these results suggest that despite its inability to bind grg co-repressors, sox2m203– <dig> retains the transcriptional activator activity of wt sox <dig>  but is significantly impaired in its ability to repress transcription from the gfap regulatory sequence.

consistent with this, when the effect of ectopic sox <dig> or the mutant sox <dig> m203– <dig> expression on gfap and six genes in nscs was assessed by qpcr, a range of levels of repression was exhibited by wt sox <dig>  this showed repression by wt sox <dig> and a reduced or lack of repression by the sox2m203– <dig> mutant .figure  <dig>

groucho-binding mutant of sox <dig> fails to repress neural differentiation
overexpression of sox <dig> in nscs has been shown to interfere with their ability to differentiate
 <cit> . we therefore compared the effect of overexpressing wt sox <dig> to the sox2m203– <dig> mutant. unlike control nscs transfected with egfp alone, cells transfected with wt sox <dig> did not extend fine, map <dig> positive processes after 5 days in differentiation medium, but instead, fewer cells extended broader, shorter processes . however, no such inhibition of differentiation was seen in cells transfected with the sox2m203– <dig> mutant.

discussion
sox <dig> is a central component of the gene regulatory network that controls a range of stem cells, most notably escs and nscs. the realization that, in addition to its role as a transcriptional activator, sox <dig> might also repress genes is relatively recent and little has been done to investigate this activity.

here, we have shown that the number of genes repressed by sox <dig> in nscs is almost identical to the number activated and we have identified one mechanism  by which it can achieve this repression. we have consequently generated a version of sox <dig> that acts as a transcriptional activator but now lacks that mechanism for repressor activity. this allows us to begin to dissect the full complexity of sox <dig> activity in regulating cell behaviour.

sox <dig> mechanism of repression
we chose to investigate a potential interaction with grgs since this interaction has already been shown to mediate repression by the hmg family protein, tcf
 <cit> . we have shown that sox <dig> does indeed, directly interact with both full length and short forms of the grgs. we used a series of deletions constructs to map the putative grg-interacting region of sox <dig> to amino acids 203– <dig> , which shows similarity to the eh <dig> grg interacting domain, f/yxi/vxxi/l/v
 <cit> . targeted mutation of this region localized the interaction to the sequence, dxxxlqy, which is well conserved in the soxb <dig> family.

however, alternative repressor mechanism may also exist. this would provide multiple aspects to the mechanisms of action of sox <dig> that could therefore be independently regulated to achieve a high level of complexity in its biological activities. it is also possible that some of the repressive effects of sox <dig> are indirect via transcriptional activation of a repressor. our results were over a short time scale so we do not feel that there was likely to be sufficient time for this to occur but it remains formally possible. this is supported by our earlier observations that the repressive effects of the very similar protein, sox <dig>  were mimicked by an hmg-engrailed repressor fusion protein
 <cit> .

relative role of transcriptional repression in sox <dig> functions
since sox <dig> has traditionally been regarded as a transcriptional activator, it is striking that our study revealed that the number of genes repressed by overexpression of sox <dig> was a similar to the number of genes that were activated. this implies that repression plays as big a part in its biological functions as does activation. since the numbers of genes affected by sox <dig> in our study closely resembles the numbers of genes affected when sox <dig> was knocked down in es cells
 <cit>  it seems probable that the effects in our study represent true targets of sox <dig> 

it is of note that the targets of sox <dig> activation are highly enriched for regulators of pol ii transcription whereas no such genes are repressed. this implies that a large part of the activator function of sox <dig>  is to regulate the biological activity of nscs indirectly through the function of downstream transcription factors, whereas its repressor function affects the cells directly though regulating effector genes. since sox <dig> is expressed in dividing progenitor cells, the enrichment for cell cycle related genes in those repressed by sox <dig> looks at first to be counterintuitive. however, this observation suggests that its normal role may be in part to control the rate of mitosis in those stem cells.

previous studies have shown that the effects of soxb1s in inhibiting the differentiation of nscs was mimicked by a constitutive activator form of soxb <dig> protein, while an hmg-enr construct caused cells to begin to differentiate, suggesting that the effects of the soxb1s were entirely through its activity as a transcriptional activator
 <cit> . however, overexpression of the hmg-enr construct did not elicit complete differentiation as shown by the absence of neurofilament or beta-tubulin expression
 <cit> . indeed, close inspection of the published data shows that an hmg-vp <dig> construct inhibits expression of early neurogenic transcription factors, but does not appear to completely inhibit expression of beta-tubulin.

we therefore suggest a model in which the activator function of sox <dig> promotes ‘stem cell-ness’ and so inhibits differentiation, but the repressor function of sox <dig> is also required to inhibit differentiation, repressing those effector genes that would be activated soon after the cells were released from the nsc state . consistent with this model and the published data, the gene encoding neurofilament light chain was amongst those genes revealed to be repressed greater than  <dig> -fold by sox <dig> in our microarray analysis.

target specificity
our observation that some genes are activated while others are repressed in the same transfected cell population, suggests that it is the gene target sequence that determines whether sox <dig> exerts its activator or repressor activity. activation or repression is not dictated solely by the availability of cofactors for these functions in a ‘cell context’ dependent manner, but is dictated by the target gene, which presumably determines which sox <dig> cofactors are available at that regulatory region to cause sox <dig> to act as either an activator or repressor.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that transcriptional repression is a major part of the mechanism by which sox <dig> acts in nscs. in order to understand how sox <dig> functions to regulate stem cell biology, we must therefore understand not only what is upstream and downstream of sox <dig>  but also which cell type-dependent cofactors are required for sox <dig> to regulate each target and the gene sequence context that determines whether the target gene is activated or repressed.
