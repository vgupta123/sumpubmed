BACKGROUND
with its rich genetic heritage and well-characterized morphology, zea mays  is a very important crop and a model system for cereal genetics and development. its moderately large genome  comprises up to 80% of repeated retrotransposons  <cit> . it is in the process of being completely sequenced and is the subject of many recent studies  <cit> . in particular, the maize transcriptome provides a source of new functionally important genes and has been recently studied with various methods such as comparisons between sense and antisense transcriptome  <cit> , serial analysis of gene expression  <cit> , and the construction of pcr-generated, normalized, or subtracted cdna libraries  <cit> .

display technologies are powerful tools for proteomics studies since they allow direct coupling of proteins with their dna encoding sequences. the prokaryotic phage display technology is the method of choice when studying non complex proteins but presents significant limitations in the case where folding, post-translational modification or oligomerization of the gene products are needed. baculovirus surface display is a relatively recent technology, which allows correct expression and presentation of eukaryotic proteins  <cit> . it is based on the use of baculovirus autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhydrosis virus  as a vector for expression of a recombinant target sequence on the surface of the virions or the host spodoptera frugiperda  cells  <cit> . the major baculoviral envelope membrane protein, gp <dig>  is usually used as the fusion partner for functional display of a foreign protein or peptide sequence on the viral surface. however, heterologous viral glycoproteins have been shown to be good alternatives to gp <dig>  such is the case of a truncated form of the vesicular stomatitis virus g glycoprotein  that allows an enhanced level of display as well as alternate presentation of epitopes  <cit> . refining the display capabilities of acmnpv has been the subject of many studies  <cit> . they have led to the development of tools for important applications, such as antigens display for production of antibodies  <cit> , molecular screening and drug delivery into mammalian target cells  <cit> , as well as baculovirus display of peptide libraries forselection of monoclonal antibody epitopes and to identify peptide antigen mimotopes  <cit> . to date however, the only study where baculovirus-based cdna library were generated did not use baculovirus-infected cells as a display platform  <cit> . we describe here the construction and preliminary analysis of a baculovirus display cdna library of maize young etiolated seedlings.

RESULTS
construction of a maize cdna display library
total rna from young maize etiolated seedlings was reverse transcribed, converted to double stranded cdna and cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pactmvsvg. this vector, combining the signal peptide of the single major envelope glycoprotein gp <dig> from acmnpv with the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of vsv-g vesicular stomatitis virus g glycoprotein, allows a high level of displayed proteins as well as alternate presentation of epitopes independent of gp <dig>  <cit> . the estimated size of the plasmid library was  <dig>  ×  <dig> independent clones, with a size distribution of cdna insert ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb.

the resulting library of plasmids constructed in the transfer vector was incorporated into the baculovirus genome by homologous recombination with a modified viral dna, bac10:ko <dig>  this viral dna cannot produce virus without undergoing recombination resulting in efficient transfer of the complexity of the vector library into the baculovirus background  <cit> . following transfection of a mixture of linearised viral dna with multiple aliquots of the transfer vector recombinant library into sf <dig> insect cells, virus was harvested at  <dig> days post infection and the supernatant pooled to form a master virus library. the library was not grown further to avoid degeneration but was stored frozen at -80°c.

expression of calreticulin and abp1
a principal of the system is that any valid cdna sequence from the maize genome would be expressed as a recombinant protein with its n-terminus fused to the gp <dig> signal sequence and c-terminus fused to the trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domain of the vsv g glycoprotein . therefore, in order to assess the functionality of the cdna library, we studied the expression of two well-characterized maize proteins, calreticulin and abp <dig> 

calreticulin is a protein abundant in the endoplasmic reticulum  of many eukaryotes, and in particular of maize  <cit> . abp <dig> is an auxin receptor found ubiquitously in vascular plants and originally identified in maize   <cit>  as a soluble protein, a proportion of which is present on the outer surface of the cell  <cit> .

the presence of maize calreticulin and abp <dig> cdnas in the maize seedlings cdna library was shown directly by pcr on the plasmid library prepared, using primers specific to calreticulin and abp <dig> sequences which revealed products of the expected sizes .

the correct expression of calreticulin and abp <dig> in insect cells infected with the baculovirus stock of the total cdna library was studied by immunoblotting. on the blots probed with polyclonal antiserum raised against maize calreticulin  <cit>  or maize abp <dig>  <cit> , polypeptides were detected in the infected extracts  but not in the extract from non-infected cells . the polypeptides migrated to a molecular weight corresponding to maize calreticulin  and to glycosylated abp <dig> , respectively. the clear expression of glycosylated abp <dig> in our system is consistent with previous work showing expression of an active abp <dig> from its cdna in a baculovirus system  <cit> . it was one of the first examples illustrating that insect cells were appropriate hosts for the expression of plant genes: abp <dig> was correctly processed and glycosylated in the endo-membrane system of insect cells. in the case of calreticulin, expression in a baculovirus system of a plant calreticulin is shown here for the first time in this study, although human calreticulin has been co-expressed in a baculovirus system by others  <cit> .

display of calreticulin and abp1
similarly to what was shown with egfp expression using pactmvsvg vector  <cit> , we expected the expressed proteins to complete the secretory pathway and be retained on the infected cell surface. in order to isolate such cells, we used the magnetic cell sorting  technology  <cit> . the indirect magnetic cell labelling was conducted using a primary antibody directed against the protein of interest and anti-immunoglobulin coated beads. macs technology has been already used for selection of baculovirus-infected cells vs. non-infected ones  <cit> . in our case however, magnetic cell sorting is used for the biopanning of specific infected cells according to the expression of a surface protein, calreticulin or abp <dig>  interacting with a specific ligand, the primary antibody. the high conservation of calreticulin sequence in plants allowed us to use an antibody directed against tobacco calreticulin  <cit> . it showed good recognition of the maize recombinant calreticulin  and was used to magnetically label cells displaying calreticulin. the maize abp <dig> polyclonal antiserum described before was used to magnetically label cells displaying abp <dig> 

virus from positively and negatively biopanned cells were amplified and used to infect fresh insect cells. expression of the proteins was studied by immunoblotting, as previously described. maize calreticulin is clearly revealed as a strong band in protein extracts from magnetically labelled cells , but cannot be detected in protein extracts from non-labelled cells , as expected. maize abp <dig> is also specifically detected, although as a minor band, in labelled cell extracts but not in non-labelled extracts . the weak signal obtained could result from a partial display of the recombinant protein or from a weak recognition by the first antibody because of unspecific interaction with the second antibody. the strong band visible in lane  <dig> could correspond to a cross-reaction between the first and the second antibody, as was noted in a study showing abp <dig> immunoprecipitation  <cit> .

we conclude therefore that calreticulin and abp <dig> are expressed and displayed by insect cells infected by baculovirus containing the whole maize cdna, demonstrating the proof of principle that our novel maize cdna display library constructed using recombinant baculoviruses can be used to isolate proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a maize cdna display library in the baculovirus transfer vector pactmvsvg, and have screened it by magnetic cell sorting for the expression and the display of two known proteins, calreticulin and abp <dig> 

both proteins are moderately abundant in maize, their expression being inducible by various developmental stage or stimuli  <cit> . the method of detection by magnetic cell sorting was sensitive enough to reveal their presence on insect cells infected by the cdna library. based on the ease of identification, we would expect to detect proteins encoded by less abundant mrnas as well, especially after normalization and/or subtraction of the amplified library  <cit> .

the library described here is based on baculovirus-infected cells as a display platform, and not only as an expression system as it is the case in the only other published baculovirus-based cdna expression library  <cit> . for this reason, it is unique in currently published cdna library. in addition, it is also, to our knowledge, the first cdna display library generated from zea mays.

the presented study advances the development and use of cdna display libraries expressed in baculovirus that could enhance gene discovery. in particular, over  <dig> million maize cdna sequences are now available  <cit>  which could be a source for discovery of new encoded proteins using this new eukaryotic in vivo display tool.

fluorescence activated cell sorting  is the classical methodology used for selection of molecules in a baculovirus surface display, as in the case of displayed peptide sequences  <cit> . here we report the use of macs for an efficient biopanning of baculovirus-infected insect cell displaying a desired protein and therefore binding to a specific antibody. the same principle of methodology could be very useful in addressing proteomic questions, such as rapid screening of the maize proteome for binding partners, for example proteins involved in hormone regulation or defence. this eukaryotic in vivo display tool would ultimately allow biopanning of a cdna library displayed on the virus surface with a target ligand of interest, thus allowing rapid screening of a proteome for binding partners.
