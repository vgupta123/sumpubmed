BACKGROUND
benzimidazole  and pro-bzd drugs are used widely to treat gastrointestinal helminthiasis including migrating larvae, liver flukes and lungworm infections in animals with a broad spectrum of activity and low mammalian toxicity  <cit> . the parent molecules of bzd anthelmintics are extensively metabolised in all animal species and the parent drug is short-lived and metabolic products predominate in systemic circulation. the primary metabolites, usually produced by oxidation and hydrolysis, are all more polar and water soluble than the parent drug. the poor water solubility reduces flexibility for drug formulation of the most potent bzd methylcarbamate anthelmintics such as albendazole  and fenbendazole , allowing their formulation only as tablets, boluses or suspensions for per os/intraruminal administration in ruminants  <cit> . after absorption from the intestine in ruminants, abz is rapidly metabolized into its anthelmintically active albendazole sulfoxide  and inactive albendazole sulfone  metabolites by liver enzymes  <cit> .

abz-so, known as ricobendazole, is chemically the sulfoxide derivative of abz being the most important antelmintically active metabolic product found systematically after abz treatment in sheep  and cattle  <cit> . abz-so is much more water soluble compared with abz. an injectable formulation of abz-so has been developed for subcutaneous  administration in cattle and sheep. this formulation has some advantages compared with the other formulations for per os or intraruminal administration, as drug molecules are potentially freely available for absorption from the injection site, avoiding the first-pass effect and actions of the oesophageal groove  <cit> . the gastrointestinal and the first-pass metabolism are common metabolic pathways for sulfoxide bzds and they are metabolised into their sulfoxides, which in turn are oxidized into the more polar and less anthelmintically active sulfone metabolites following per os administration in different animal species.

sulfoxide bzds  which have a chiral centre about the sulfur atom are formed as metabolites of sulfides and are metabolised into sulfones. pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of enantiospecific pairs are commonly different and are of major importance for their effective and safe therapeutic use. the sulfones are anthelmintically inactive, whereas sulfides and sulfoxides are both active  <cit> . although the plasma dispositions of two enantiomers of abz-so and ofz have been investigated in many species after per os administration of the pro-chiral abz, fbz and racemic abz-so and ofz , there is a paucity of data available in the literature on the stereospecific plasma behaviour of the enantiomers of abz-so following intravenous  and sc administration of rac-abz-so in goats.

due to a shortage of registered drugs available for goats in most countries, different classes of drugs, including anthelmintics licensed for sheep are extensively used in goats without optimization of dosing regimens and determination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties  <cit> . it is generally acknowledged that the plasma disposition and metabolism of anthelmintic drugs are different between sheep and goats . goats metabolise and eliminate anthelmintic compounds more rapidly from blood compared with sheep. the presence of the metabolic differences between two species has been not considered for many years. the high prevalence of anthelmintic-resistant nematodes in goats are probably due to the extensive extra-label use of these compounds at a standard ovine dosage, corresponding to a drug under-dosing and leading to reduced efficacy of the drug  <cit> . therefore, the present study was designed to compare the pharmacokinetic and bioavailability of abz-so in goats and sheep following iv and sc administrations at a dose rate of 5 mg/kg bodyweight  and to investigate the effects of increased doses  on the plasma disposition of abz-so in goats following sc administration. in addition, the stereospecific disposition of enantiomers  was also determined and compared in both species after iv and sc administrations of racemic -abz-so.

discussions
the present study showed that the auc and mrt values of abz-so in goats were significantly smaller and shorter compared with those observed in sheep. moreover, t1/ <dig> of abz-so was significantly shorter in goats compared with that observed in sheep following iv and sc administrations at a dose of 5 mg/kg bw. the origin of the lower plasma concentration in goats is unclear. the most likely explanation for the origin of these kinetic differences is that goats have a greater metabolic capacity and elimination capability of abz-so in comparison with sheep. previous studies indicated that the plasma disposition and metabolism of anthelmintic drugs are different between sheep and goats . it has been commonly acknowledged that the anthelmintic drugs are more rapidly metabolised and eliminated from blood in goats compared with sheep. this difference has been shown for different anthelmintic compounds, including bzds  endectocides  <cit> , levamisole,  <cit>  and oxyclozanide  <cit> . the greater ability to detoxify exogenous compounds, including anthelmintics, has been attributed to the specific feeding behaviour of goats  <cit> , since the feeding behaviour of goats is quite different compared with that of sheep. sheep are known as grazers, preferring to feed on grass and forbs, whereas goats are described as ingesting substantial amounts of browse . thus, goats are better adapted to tolerate and detoxify plant toxins and exogenous compounds compared with sheep  <cit> .

the plasma disposition of abz-so has been previously reported in sheep after iv and sc administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg bw  <cit> . some findings in the present study  are similar to those obtained by formentini et al.  <cit>   in sheep following iv administration at a same dose rate . on the other hand, although cmax , t1/ <dig>  and f  values of abz-so are similar, the auc  tmax , and mat  values are larger and longer than those reported by formentini et al.  <cit>  in sheep, respectively. the origin of the differences between the studies is unclear. these differences between the studies may be attributable to differences in methodology or experimental conditions such as different feeding type or regime, or even to parasitological status of the animals that may cause differences in absorption, disposition and persistence of anthelmintic drugs in the animals.

the results obtained in the present study indicate that an increase in abz-so dosage in goats is associated with elevation in the plasma level of abz-so. significantly higher auc and cmax values for abz-so were observed after sc administration at both dose rates of  <dig> and 15 mg⁄ kg compared to the treatment at 5 mg⁄ kg . the auc of abz-so increased from  <dig>   to  <dig>   and to  <dig>  μg.h/ml . these findings are in agreement with the previous study performed by alvarez et al.  <cit>  who indicated that increasing the dose of abz  is associated with enhanced plasma level and exposure of abz metabolites in sheep after intraruminal administration.

the plasma dispositions of the two enantiomers of abz-so have been investigated in many species after oral administration of the pro-chiral abz , and after iv and per os administration of abz-so in sheep  <cit>  which is discussed by capece et al.  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that  abz-so was anthelmintically more potent than rac-abz-so and  abz-so by using an ex vivo murine model for trichinella spiralis infection  <cit> .

the current study also showed that the enantiomers of abz-so were never in racemic proportions and the enantiospecific ratio  of plasma concentration of abz-so changed over time in favour of the  enantiomer in sheep and goats after both iv and sc administration of rac-abz-so. the auc of the  enantiomer was almost  <dig> times larger than that of  enantiomer of abz-so, in agreement with the previous studies performed by capece et al.  <cit>  who indicated that  enantiomer represented  <dig> and 80 % of the total plasma auc of abz-so in male and female sheep, respectively. this may contribute to the anthelmintic effect of the  abz-so enantiomer since it has been shown that  abz-so is quickly metabolised into the inactive sulfone  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the flavin monooxygenase  system is enantioselective in favour of the  sulfoxide of abz, whereas only cytochrome p <dig> systems specifically produce  abz-so which was shown to be the main substrate for the formation of the inactive sulphone metabolite  <cit> . differences in the interspecies enantioselectivity could be explained by different metabolic enzyme contributions.

CONCLUSIONS
although the absorption phase and the peak plasma concentration of abz-so were similar in both species, the plasma availability, elimination and persistence of abz-so were significantly lower and shorter in goats compared with those observed in sheep, respectively, following sc administrations at a dose of 5 mg/kg bw. as a consequence, treatment of goats with abz-so at the recommended sheep dose may result in reduced anthelmintic efficacy, which may increase the risk of drug resistance in internal parasites. moreover, it was also shown that increasing the dose of abz-so in goats was associated with enhanced plasma exposures after sc administration. therefore, increased doses could be a strategy to provide higher and more persistent plasma concentration and thus to improve the efficacy against the target parasites and to delay the development of anthelmintic resistance in goat parasites.
