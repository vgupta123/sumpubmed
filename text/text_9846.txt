BACKGROUND
the airways are lined by epithelium and the upper airways have mucus gland acini, all of which contribute to secretion of both water and mucus coating the surface. the epithelium forms a physical barrier to inhaled substances and, actively secretes and absorbs fluid to provide an appropriate thickness hydrated layer on the surface of the airways. the epithelium clears particulates from the airways by ciliary action and ingestion by macrophages. there is a local immune response to inhaled antigens in part through resident macrophages and dendritic cells. epithelial function is controlled by neurotransmitters  and blood born substances  and substances released from inflammatory cells . several serious diseases are linked to disfunction of the epithelium such as cystic fibrosis and asthma. therefore proper functioning of the epithelium is critical for normal lung function.

cholinergic stimulation of muscarinic receptors is known to increase mucus secretion from submucosal gland cells  <cit> , fluid transport by submucosal gland cells  <cit> , and ciliary beat frequency of ciliated epithelium  <cit> . the secretory functions are transient , occurring for several minutes during continuous stimulation of the cells by ach  <cit> . this synchrony makes sense from a functional standpoint since mucus that is secreted must be hydrated by secretion of fluid. the increase in cilia beat frequency caused by muscarinic receptor activation can then clear the ejected and secreted mucus.

histamine can also stimulate the release of mucus and fluid by submucosal gland cells. the effects of ach and histamine on short circuit current  are transient, reflecting the transient nature of the increase in secretion of fluid. stimulation of these cells by histamine probably does not support normal secretions, but represents mast cell degranulation, typically associated with the symptomatology of a pathological state such as asthma or allergies. the symptoms of airway irritation and hypersecretion are commonly treated with antihistamines except for the case of asthma, where excessive drying of the mucus membranes by first-generation antihistamines is considered a contraindication.

the antimuscarinic actions of first generation h <dig> selective antihistamines are well known  <cit> . in fact, some of the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs  and side effects  may also be attributable to these actions. generally, the antimuscarinic actions of the h <dig> selective antihistamines are undesirable, in particular in people with high blood pressure, arrhythmias or asthma. h <dig> selective antihistamines devoid of antimuscarinic properties should be useful in the treatment of asthma since mast cell degranulation occurs during the early phase of an asthma attack releasing histamine causing mucus secretion, inflammatory reactions in the airway epithelium, vasodilation in the mucosa and contraction of airway smooth muscle  <cit> . each of these events leads to a narrowing or stiffening of the airways and increased resistance to air flow. theoretically, h <dig> selective antihistamines devoid of antimuscarinic properties would decrease the pathological effects of histamine without altering the normal control of the cells in the airway by ach at muscarinic, m <dig>  receptors. yanni et al.  <cit>  suggested that an antihistamine, effective at both h <dig> and h <dig> receptors, lacking antimuscarinic actions, would be useful in the treatment of asthma. lee et al.  <cit>  proposed that selective h <dig> antihistamines could be useful in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma and have additive effects with leukotriene antagonists. therefore, the following experiments were performed to determine the antimuscarinic actions of several antihistamines on muscarinic receptor induced increases in ion transport by mucus gland cell epithelium grown in culture or porous bottom inserts as measured using ussing chamber methodology.

RESULTS
antimuscarinic effects
after two days in culture the mucus gland cells have formed confluent cell layers on the millicell inserts and current flow can be measured across the inserts. in figure 1a the short circuit currents  evoked by cumulative addition of ach are shown. the currents were used to generate concentration-response relationships for agonists on changes in Δisc. the responses to both ach and histamine are phasic, particularly obvious at higher concentrations of agonist . the maximum increase in current was  <dig> ±  <dig> μa/cm <dig>  for histamine and  <dig>  ±  <dig> μa/cm <dig>  for ach. also, illustrated in this figure is the basic protocol used for all experiments.  <dig> μm amiloride is added to the mucosal side of the mucus gland cells to block fluid reabsorption. a small decrease in basal current occurs indicative of the reabsorption of sodium and fluid by the monolayer. the addition of the test drug to the serosal chamber, in this case the prototypical muscarinic antagonist atropine, causes little change in baseline current. after five minutes ach is added cumulatively to the serosal side of the cells. the concentrations are indicated at the arrows. ach was added at  <dig> to  <dig> second intervals into each of the 4– <dig> ussing chambers being used during an experiment. thus, the apparent "shift to the right" that occurs in the response in the presence of atropine in this figure is indicative of inhibition of the muscarinic receptors. the parallel shifts in the concentration-response relationships to the right for ach caused by atropine are illustrated in fig 1b for averaged peak data at each agonist concentration normalized to the maximal response for each insert. the method of schild was used to determine the apparent ki for atropine as shown in fig  <dig>  the slope of the line through the data points is set to  <dig>  with the x intercept giving an estimate of the pa <dig> . the pa <dig> for atropine  was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . subtype selective inhibitors of muscarinic receptors were used to suggest which subtype of muscarinic receptor was being activated by ach to induce the increases in Δisc. 4-diphenylacetoxy-n-methylpiperidine  is a relatively selective antagonist for m <dig> muscarinic receptors and methoctramine is a relatively selective antagonist for m <dig> muscarinic receptors. the pa <dig> for these drugs was: 4-damp  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; methoctramine  <dig>  ±  <dig> . these values are consistent with m <dig> receptor inhibition  <cit> . therefore, the inhibitory constants given for antihistamine block of muscarinic receptors are considered to be against the m <dig> subtype in the following experiments.

six antihistamines were tested for inhibition of the muscarinic receptor response in gland cells. the antihistamines are: desloratadine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine. each was examined using the protocol described for atropine. in addition, the antihistaminic activity of each compound was confirmed by the ability of these drugs to block histamine-induced increases in Δisc. in figure 3a the effects of desloratadine on the Δisc induced by ach are shown. as with atropine there is a shift to the right in the concentration-response relationships  that, when plotted using the dose-ratio method of schild, yields a linear plot with slope of one  and an estimated pa <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig> .

the schild plot for diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine is also shown in fig 3c. their pa <dig> values are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. hydroxyzine is much less potent antagonist at muscarinic receptors than desloratadine and diphenhydramine . the active metabolite of hydroxyzine, cetirizine, has no effects on muscarinic receptor activation  even at very high concentrations . the precursor of desloratadine, loratadine, had no antimuscarinic action . fexofenadine had no antimuscarinic action at concentrations up to  <dig> μm . a compilation of the pa <dig> values is presented in table  <dig> 
a- all estimates for ki are statistically different  except diphenhydramine and desloratadine

antihistaminic effects
we did not perform schild analysis on the antihistaminic effects of the antihistamines because the underlying assumptions were not met. the basic underlying assumptions of schild analysis are: 1) the inhibition of a response by the antagonist is competitive and 2) that during the response, equilibrium of the antagonist and agonist for the receptor is reached. while these requirements seem to be met at least tacitly for muscarinic receptors, they do not appear to be met for antagonism of the effects of histamine. fig 5a shows the Δisc response to histamine. the Δisc response declines rapidly after reaching a peak, even at low concentrations of histamine. this provides little time for equilibrium conditions to be met during the response. in the case of diphenhydramine there is a shift to the right in the concentration-response relationships for histamine with little decrease in maximum response, as shown in fig 5a and inset. the inset shows the resulting schild plot with an estimated pa <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   when the slope the line shown in the inset was set to <dig>  however, the least squares fit to these data had a slope of  <dig>   and was curvilinear with estimated pa <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . this finding suggested that the underlying assumptions of the schild analysis were not met. this is more clearly illustrated for the case of fexofenadine as shown in fig 5b. fexofenadine causes a decrease in the maximum response to histamine and a shift to the right in the concentration response relationship. using data such as shown in fig 5b inset for inhibition of peak response, we computed the "% of maximal control Δisc" response  for each of the antihistamines; hydroxyzine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine and desloratadine. a graph of these data is shown in fig  <dig>  desloratadine is the most potent antihistamine in this group  and loratadine the least potent . table  <dig> gives a compilation of the estimates of potency for all compounds tested.

discussion
in order to test the validity of using short-circuit current responses for the measurement of pa <dig> values for inhibition of muscarinic receptors, we first examined the effect of classical muscarinic receptor inhibitors on the ach-induced currents. as shown in table  <dig> the pa <dig> estimated for atropine was  <dig> . this value is in good agreement with estimates from many other tissues  with estimated ki of in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm. kubo et al.  <cit>  measured a ki for diphenhydramine against qnb binding in the cerebral cortex, indicative of all muscarinic receptor subtype binding, of  <dig>  μm similar to our value of  <dig>  μm for m <dig> muscarinic receptor induced secretion from mucus gland cells. cardelus et al.  <cit>  estimated a similar potency for desloratadine of approximately  <dig>  μm  against muscarinic-induced contraction of rabbit iris.

by contrast, estimates of affinity using the dose-ratio method for the inhibition of the histamine receptor were not done except for diphenhydramine. the underlying assumptions of schild analysis were clearly not met. two of these assumptions are: 1) the inhibition of a response by the antagonist is competitive and 2) that during the response, equilibrium of the antagonist and agonist with the receptor is reached. these requirements are at least tacitly met for antihistamine binding to muscarinic receptors and one or both are clearly not met in the case of histamine receptors. the antagonists are known to bind competitively with histamine receptors as shown in receptor binding assays  <cit> . therefore, it seems reasonable that the second condition is not met. as shown for the Δisc response to histamine in fig 5b, the responses decline rapidly after reaching a peak . the decline occurs even at low concentrations of histamine. at least quasi-equilibrium conditions need to be established within a very few minutes. anthes et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that for desloratadine the off-rate for binding was quite slow with only 37% of the desloratadine released from the receptor in  <dig> hours. christophe et al.  <cit>  determined the t1/ <dig> for dissociation of cetirizine from the h <dig> receptor to be  <dig> min. the slow rate of dissociation of the antihistamine from the receptor resulted in a decreased maximum response, with little apparent shift in the concentration response relationship. this is reminiscent of non-competitive inhibition, since equilibrium cannot be reached during the transient response. thus, the calculation of pa <dig>  using the method of schild, is not valid for antihistamine inhibition of histamine-induced increases in short-circuit current. this conclusion was also drawn by miller et al.  <cit>  for inhibition of the initiation of calcium transients. however, qualitatively the potencies of the antagonists can be estimated from the concentration required to reduce the peak response by 50%, as shown in fig 5b. the rank order of potency using this method is: desloratadine > cetirizine ≈ hydroxyzine > fexofenadine > diphenhydramine > loratadine. this differs from the rank order of affinities determined by anthes et al.  <cit>  using radioligand binding assays: desloratadine > diphenhydramine > hydroxyzine > cetirizine > loratadine : <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  respectively). our estimates of potency are  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than the binding constants reflecting the differences in methodology. the difference in the rank order of potency primarily is due to our estimate of the potency of diphenhydramine using the dose-ratio method. we estimated a pa <dig> for diphenhydramine of  <dig>   much higher than the ki estimates of  <dig> – <dig> nm by others  <cit> . this suggests that even in the case of diphenhydramine equilibrium conditions are not met. it should be noted that the estimate of pa <dig> derived in this report assumed a slope of  <dig> for the schild plot. the slope by least square fit to the data was  <dig>   and curvilinear. therefore, diphenhydramine inhibition is also non-equilibrium, and we expect that the actual pa <dig> for diphenhydramine is in the range of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . this conclusion was also drawn by miller et al.  <cit> . they found that diphenhydramine inhibited the histamine-induced transient calcium response in an apparent non-competitive manner.

our findings suggest that of the antihistamines tested, the rank order of selectivity for histamine over muscarinic receptors is: cetirizine ≈ fexofenadine > loratadine > desloratadine > hydroxyzine ≥ diphenhydramine. this was derived from the ratio of the estimated potencies of muscarinic inhibition and histaminergic inhibition. since fexofenadine, cetirizine and loratadine did not affect the muscarinic response they were assumed to be the most selective with cetirizine having the higher potency toward histamine receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
it is likely that antihistamines with significant antimuscarinic effects in this assay might show some antimuscarinic actions in vivo. however, the antimuscarinic actions probably will occur early after dosing and be short lived, since as the plasma levels of the drugs decrease muscarinic inhibition would readily reverse, compared with the comparatively slow release of antihistamines from the histamine receptors. this would be true for most second generation antihistamines and hydroxyzine, but would not be true for diphenhydramine. this is born out by the well known antimuscarinic action of diphenhydramine. thus, of the agents tested, those with the least antimuscarinic action such as fexofenadine and cetirizine, may be the most useful for treatment of allergic rhinitis and possibly as an adjunct drug in the treatment of asthma.
