BACKGROUND
tobacco rattle virus  has straight tubular particles of two predominant lengths, the longer are about 190 nm and the shorter are  <dig> to 115 nm, depending on the isolate. normal particle-producing isolates  have two species of genomic rna, i.e. rna <dig> and rna <dig>  these are readily transmitted by inoculation with sap, and by nematodes in the family trichodoridae.

trv is a useful vector because of its bipartite rna. the rna <dig> and rna <dig> sequences of trv can be used independently as vectors in plants and plant cells. a trv-rna <dig> vector can be engineered to carry a heterologous nucleic acid for delivery into a plant. the trv vector induces very mild symptoms, infects large areas of adjacent cells and silences gene expression in growing points. in addition, it is commonly used to enable gene identification. trv is a positive-strand rna virus with a bipartite genome. proteins encoded by rna <dig> are sufficient for replication and movement within the host plant, while proteins encoded by rna <dig> allow virion formation and nematode-mediated transmission between plants  <cit> .

one of the most effective forms of plant defense against viruses is posttranscriptional gene silencing . in this the plant’s rna-silencing machinery is activated and the virus will be subject to rna silencing. therefore, ptgs is an attractive endogenous process that can be exploited to study gene function. virus-induced gene silencing  is one of the most efficient approaches to activate the ptgs process. when a recombinant viral vector  carrying a host-derived target gene sequence infects a plant, the trv viral double-stranded rnas are synthesized, leading to the activation of the antiviral rna silencing pathway and the subsequent knockdown of the endogenous host gene. the vigs technique is nowadays widely used to allow the transient interruption of gene function through a process similar to rna interference  <cit> . the basis of the technique is a mechanism that is inherent in the plants for combating viruses  <cit> . engineered viruses carrying one or more target genes are introduced into the plant. the double stranded rna produced during virus replication triggers the degradation of any rna with sequence similarity, including the endogenous transcripts of the target gene.

pepper is an important vegetable crop, which enriches our diets. the pepper colors are mainly determined by chlorophyll, anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments; with carotenoids being responsible for colors in mature pepper fruits. previous studies have shown that a range of genes are responsible for carotenoid formation and it is these that result in the varied colors of pepper fruits  <cit> . capsanthin is a red carotenoid that gives mature pepper fruits their red color, and it is an end product in the pepper carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. the capsanthin biosynthetic pathway starts from geranylgeranyl diphospahate , and then phytoene synthase  converts two molecules of ggpp to phytoene. after this, four desaturation reactions convert phytoene to lycopene, and the lycopene undergoes a cyclization reaction at both ends mediated by lycopene β-cyclase , thus producing β-carotene. β-carotene is then converted to β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin with the reactions being triggered by β-carotene hydroxylase . zeaxanthin is converted into antheraxanthin and violaxanthin when catalyzed by zeaxanthin expoxidase ; then, antheraxanthin and violaxanthin are converted to capsanthin by ccs and zep  <cit> . the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes that are involved in the capsanthin biosynthesis pathway have been cloned from pepper  <cit> .these genes are directly involved in the red color of fruits  <cit> .the capsanthin and capsorubin pigments are responsible for the red color in pepper fruits, and they are regulated by ccs gene. when the fruits starting to ripening, the ccs gene begins to be expressed, which catalyzes zeaxanthin to be transformed into capsanthin  <cit> .the yellow color in pepper fruits is due to a ccs gene deletion or ccs mutation, which means that capsanthin cannot be synthesized  <cit> . the question raised here is whether pepper fruit colors are associated with ccs gene expression or not. therefore, it is important to understand the functions of the main genes that regulate the color development on peppers.

there has been very little research work on the color change in detached pepper fruits. we used virus-induced gene silencing  technology to explore the molecular mechanism of color formation in the detached fruits. with the focus on the silencing of key genes involved in the capsanthin biosynthetic pathway and an exploration of the effects of different genes being removed on pepper fruit color formation.

RESULTS
effects of certain genes being silenced on pepper fruit color
the ccs gene carried by the trv viral vector was injected into detached fruits of capsicum annuum cv. r <dig>  compared to the control fruits, different colors were observed in the fruits that had been treated with the trv vector that had the ccs gene, 15 days after inoculation .the color of the fruits injected with the trv vector carrying the ccs gene was from green to yellow , while the control fruits were green to red color . these results showed that a yellow fruit color is because of the silencing of the ccs gene. we further confirmed these results with the trv/ <dig>  in which the empty vector  was injected into detached pepper fruits, and the fruits were found to be the same color as the control fruits . this confirmed that the yellow pepper fruit color is due to silencing of the ccs gene .figure  <dig>

we used vigs technology to determine the purpose of key genes involved in the color development in pepper fruits, and confirmed these changes by observing them in mature fruits.

changes in fruits’ color during simultaneous silencing of several key genes
we simultaneously silenced key genes to observe the effect of the genes deletion on the pepper fruits’ color. firstly, we simultaneously silenced two genes , and obtained pepper fruits with a slightly orange color . secondly, we simultaneously silenced three genes , and observed that the fruits’ color went from green to yellow . thirdly, we simultaneously silenced four key genes , and observed that the pepper fruits’ color went from green to bright yellow .these results showed that single gene silencing and multi-gene silencing had different effects on the pepper fruit color, which revealed that several genes had synergistic effects on fruit color formation.figure  <dig>

changes in target genes’ expression in pepper fruits through vigs technology
to better understand the relationship between the fruits’ color and gene expression, we extracted rna from normal fruits, trv empty vector injected fruits and gene silenced fruits. total rna was purified and first-strand cdna was synthesized by reverse transcriptase. then real-time quantitative pcr was used to determine the genes’ expression.

firstly, we looked at the phenotypic fruit color variation when a single target gene was silenced. from figure  <dig> it could be seen that when the ccs gene was silenced, there were no significant differences in the ccs gene expression level of the wt and trv/ <dig> groups, the ccs gene expression level in the trv/ccs group was significantly decreased compared with the wt group and the ccs gene expression level of the trv/ccs group was about 20% that in the wt and trv/ <dig> groups. all the other genes  showed normal expressions. this demonstrated that the yellow phenotype of the pepper fruits was due to the ccs gene being silenced when the trv carrying the ccs gene infected the detached pepper fruits . similarly, when the psy gene was silenced, there were no significant differences in the psy gene expression level of the wt and trv/ <dig> groups, the psy gene expression level in the trv/psy group was significantly decreased compared with the wt group and the psy gene expression level of the trv/psy group was about 20% that in the wt and trv/ <dig> groups. all other genes  showed normal expressions. this demonstrated that the orange phenotype of the pepper fruits was due to the psy gene being silenced when the trv carrying the psy gene infected the detached pepper fruits . for the trv/lcyb and trv/crtz, the expression of the lcyb, crtz and other genes in the wt group, trv/ <dig> group and trv/target genes group were similar. that is, the deep yellow phenotype of the pepper fruits was due to the lcyb gene or crtz gene being silenced when the trv carrying the psy gene or crtz gene infected the detached pepper fruits .figure  <dig>

secondly, we looked at the phenotype of the fruits’ color variation when several key genes were simultaneously silenced. when the psy and lcyb genes were silenced simultaneously, there were no significant differences in the psy and lcyb genes expression levels of the wt and trv/ <dig> groups, the psy and lcyb genes expression levels in the trv/psy/lcyb group were significantly decreased compared with the wt group and the psy and lcyb genes expression levels of the trv/psy/lcyb group were about 20%-30% that of the wt and trv/ <dig> groups. all other genes, for example, ccs and crtz genes,  showed normal expressions.this demonstrated that the slightly orange phenotype of the pepper fruits was due to the psy and lcyb genes being silenced when the trv carrying the psy and lcyb genes infected the detached pepper fruits .figure  <dig>

when the psy, lcyb and crtz genes were silenced simultaneously, there were no significant differences in the psy, lcyb and crtz genes expression levels of the wt and trv/ <dig> groups, the psy, lcyb and crtz genes expression levels in the trv/psy/lcyb/crtz group were significantly decreased compared with the wt group but the psy, lcyb and crtz genes expression levels of the trv/psy/lcyb/crtz group were about 20%-30% that in the wt and trv/ <dig> groups. all other genes, for example, the ccs gene,  showed normal expressions. this demonstrated that the yellow phenotype of the pepper fruits was due to the psy, lcyb and crtz genes being silenced when the trv carrying the psy, lcyb and crtz genes infected the detached pepper fruits .figure  <dig>

when the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes were silenced simultaneously, there were no significant differences in the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes expression levels in the wt and trv/ <dig> groups, the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes expression levels in the trv/psy/lcyb/crtz/ccs group were significantly decreased compared with the wt group and the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes expression levels in the trv/psy/lcyb/crtz/ccs group were about 20%-30% that of the wt and trv/ <dig> groups. this demonstrated that the bright yellow phenotype of the pepper fruits was due to the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes being silenced when the trv carrying the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes infected the detached pepper fruits .figure  <dig>

when considering the above results it could be seen that when the trv vector carrying the target gene was injected into detached fruits the expression levels of the genes were 20%-30% those of the levels in the normal fruits and those injected with an empty vector . this showed that a 70%-80% efficiency of target gene silencing was achieved. these results proved that gene silencing caused fruit color changes. therefore, the target gene silencing was a cause of fruit color change.

changes in composition of carotenoids in pepper fruits when a gene or some genes were silenced
the phenomenon of high or low target gene expression levels were not enough for an interpretation of the phenotype of the pepper fruits’ color variation. therefore, we determined the carotenoids’ composition in pepper fruits using the hplc method . an hplc system that was able to resolve the β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and capsanthin, and determine their levels via detection at an absorbance of 454 nm was utilized. additional file 2: figure s <dig>  additional file 3: figure s <dig>  additional file 4: figure s <dig>  additional file 5: figure s <dig>  additional file 6: figure s <dig>  additional file 7: figure s <dig>  additional file 8: figure s <dig>  additional file 9: figure s <dig>  additional file 10: figure s <dig> contain the hplc profiles.figure  <dig> 
carotenoids content in pepper fruits. wt: fruits not injected and trv/00: fruits injected with empty vector. values + sd of three independent biological replicates.



we knew that β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and capsanthin are the primary ingredients in the pepper fruits’ carotenoids biosynthetic pathway. these carotenoid ingredients would be affected when a gene or several genes were silenced. from figure  <dig>  we could see that the wt and trv/ <dig> had no obvious differences in the carotenoids’ compositions. and we also could identify that the levels of the metabolic intermediates  in the capsanthin biosynthetic pathway had different rate reductions when one or several key genes were silenced in pepper fruit, but there was a slight noticeable change in the content of capsanthin. therefore, to obtain a greater understanding the results need to be considered in greater detail. first of all, when silencing the ccs gene, the levels of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and capsanthin reduced than those of the wt. however, the capsanthin content of the fruits in which ccs was silenced reduced significantly. this demonstrated that the fruit color change was caused by silencing the ccs gene. secondly, when silencing the psy gene, compared with the wt, the content of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and capsanthin in the trv/psy fruits reduced significantly. this indicated that the intermediate products of the capsanthin biosynthetic pathway were negatively affected by silencing the psy gene, which resulted in the content of capsanthin being reduced. this resulted in a significant difference in the fruit color of normal and silenced fruits. thirdly, when silencing the lcyb gene, compared with the wt, the content of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and capsanthin in the trv/lcyb fruits reduced at different rates, and the content of capsanthin decreased significantly by comparing with the control. fourthly, when the crtz gene was silenced, compared with the wt, the content of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin decreased slightly, while the content of capsanthin decreased significantly. finally, when silencing several key genes, we can see that the content of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin decreased in different degrees, and the content of capsanthin decreased significantly among these metabolites. these results indicated that there was a significant reduction in the capsanthin content whether a single gene or several genes were simultaneously silenced. this showed that the change in fruit color was due to abnormal expression of these key genes, and this caused the content of the intermediate metabolite  in the capsanthin biosynthetic pathway to be reduced. eventually, this affected the normal synthesis of capsanthin, which resulted in the fruit color not becoming the normal red .

discussion
vigs is a quick method for target gene silencing to produce phenotype changes; therefore, vigs can be used to quickly identify a gene’s function  <cit> . trv as a vigs vector is able to penetrate the parts of a plant that are growing. this means that the infections could be spread by cell division as well as transport. as a result, infections will be more uniform and there would be less of a dilution effect from non-infected cells on the silencing. in addition, trv-induced silencing could be initiated in undifferentiated growing point cells and the silencing would be masked by gene expression in non-infected cells due to the target gene expression prior to infection.

however, the silencing effect remains transient in the majority of cases and the timing of its appearance as well as its duration is species-specific. for example, the barley stripe mosaic virus -induced a vigs effect in barley that lasted 1– <dig> weeks and trv mediated silencing in california poppy  was lost after 16 weeks, while apple latent spherical virus -mediated silencing was maintained in soybean throughout the plant’s life and was even transmitted to the next generation  <cit> . another challenge when using this technique is a variation in the level of penetration in vegetative and reproductive tissue that requires a larger number of plants to be screened for phenotypes. silencing effects are often found in dividing sectors of the plant or restricted to plant organs formed from a few consecutive nodes  <cit> . this study demonstrated that trv-induced vigs effects in detached pepper fruits lasted for 30 days, which was enough to determine the relationship between the genes and fruit color.

it could be observed from figure  <dig> that in the wt group; when the fruits were ripe the major pigment was capsanthin that was present in much greater amounts than the other carotenoids. the higher the capsanthin content in the pepper fruits, the deeper the red color. next we analyzed the causes of fruit color formation when key genes were silenced by vigs.

firstly, we analyzed the causes of the fruits’ color formation when a single target gene was silenced. by analyzing gene expression levels and the composition of the carotenoids, it was found that when the ccs gene had a low expression level and the capsanthin synthesis decreased, the pepper fruit color was yellow when the ccs gene was silenced. after psy gene silencing, the psy gene also had a low expression level and capsanthin synthesis decreased, but the level of capsanthin was higher in the trv/psy group than the trv/ccs group, so the pepper fruit color was orange when the psy gene was silenced. similarly, the trv/lcyb group and trv/crtz group caused a yellow fruit color after the psy gene or crtz gene was silenced.

secondly, we analyzed the causes of the fruits’ color formation when several key genes were silenced simultaneously. by analyzing gene expression levels and the composition of the carotenoids, it was found that the psy and lcyb genes had low expression levels and capsanthin synthesis decreased  when the psy and lcyb genes were silenced simultaneously, which meant that the pepper fruit color was yellow. after the psy, lcyb and crtz genes were silenced simultaneously, the psy, lcyb and crtz genes also had low expression levels and the capsanthin synthesis decreased , so the pepper fruit was yellow. similarly, when the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes were silenced simultaneously, the psy, lcyb, crtz and ccs genes also had low expression levels and the capsanthin synthesis decreased , so the phenotype of the fruit was yellow .

the focus of previous studies has been the opposing genetic characters of red and yellow, and they determined that red is dominant and controlled by a single gene at the y locus of the sixth chromosome  <cit> . the mature fruit color of the pepper is determined by capsanthin. researchers have found that capsanthin is synthesized by the enzyme capsanthin-capsorubin synthase . ha et al  <cit>  determined that the ccs gene was not present in yellow pepper. sequence analyses of the ccs gene revealed two structural mutations in yellow peppers that are a result of either a premature stop-codon or a frame-shift. a ccs transcript was not detectable in yellow peppers. the deletion of the ccs gene is not responsible for the yellow ripening in capsicum  <cit> .

previous studies related to pepper fruit color had a focus on ccs gene deletion or mutation, while other key genes related to fruit color change were rarely studied. this study’s experimental results revealed that the fruit color becoming yellow and orange was not only confined to ccs gene silencing but it was also related to psy, lcyb and ctrz genes silencing. this demonstrates that there is still a lot of work to be done on the fruit color genes. vigs technology can be used to analyze gene function, and our experiments analyzed genes related to fruit color in detached fruit. as genes were silenced, the pepper fruits changed their color resulting in many different colors. still, it needs to explore whether this is the result of the action of one gene or several genes, which will be solved in the future. vigs technology was used with detached fruits, which provided reliable information about the relationship between genes and fruit color formation and gave quick results, which was important.

CONCLUSIONS
by using vigs technology, we determined that there was a relationship between changes in pepper fruit color and the target genes’  silencing; while, single gene and multi-gene silencing had different effects on fruit color, as determined from the data presented in this paper. compared with capsanthin, the levels of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin or zeaxanthin were very low in pepper fruits. in addition, the content of capsanthin decreased significantly after a single gene or a group of genes were silenced. silencing any key gene would either directly or indirectly influence synthesis of capsanthin. this led to the pepper fruits’ color changes. vigs technology was used in detached fruits, which simplified the research process of studying the genes related to pepper fruit color changes. this gave a better platform to understand the relationship between colorful pepper fruits and the genetic regulation.
