BACKGROUND
secretoglobin  3a <dig>  also called high in normal- <dig>   <cit>  or uteroglobin-related protein  <dig>   <cit> , is a member of the scgb gene superfamily that consists of small secretory proteins  <cit> . hin- <dig> was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene because its expression was silenced by methylation in the majority of human breast carcinomas  <cit> . ugrp <dig> was independently identified as a homologous gene to ugrp <dig>  that is a downstream target for the homeodomain transcription factor nkx2- <dig>  also called titf <dig>  ttf <dig>  nkx <dig> , or t/ebp  <cit> . mouse scgb3a <dig> and scgb3a <dig> share 33% amino acid sequence identity  <cit> .

in humans, scgb3a <dig> is highly expressed in the trachea, lung, salivary gland, prostate, esophagus, duodenum and mammary gland  <cit> , whereas in mouse, it is primarily expressed in the trachea and lung, and weakly expressed in the heart, stomach, and small intestine  <cit> . methylation patterns of the human scgb3a <dig> gene promoter have been extensively studied and a correlation of methylation and loss of scgb3a <dig> expression and malignant phenotypes is well established in many human cancers including breast, prostate, lung, and pancreatic carcinomas  <cit> . the akt signaling pathway is responsible for the scgb3a1's tumor suppressor function as characterized by inhibition of cell growth, cell migration and invasion  <cit> . in this connection, it was shown that egf and tgfγ increase scgb3a <dig> expression through activation of the erk-mapk and phosphoinositide- <dig> kinase-akt pathways  <cit> . further, the expression of scgb3a <dig> is restricted to terminally differentiated airway epithelial cells and is up-regulated during retinoic acid induced differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that scgb3a <dig> may be involved in the acquisition or maintenance of the terminally differentiated epithelial phenotype  <cit> .

under interleukin - <dig> and il- <dig> stimulation, scgb3a <dig> expression is up-regulated through binding of stat <dig> to the stat binding element located in - <dig> to - <dig> bp of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter  <cit> , suggesting that scgb3a <dig> may also play a role in inflammation. in fact, a recent report demonstrated that scgb3a <dig> , a homologous gene to scgb3a <dig>  suppresses allergic airway inflammation when a mouse model for allergic airway inflammation is subjected to intranasal administration of recombinant adenovirus expressing scgb3a <dig>  <cit> . stat <dig> is the only transcription factor downstream of il- <dig> and il- <dig> signaling thus far demonstrated that directly binds to the scgb3a <dig> promoter and regulates expression of the gene  <cit> . it is not known what transcription factors are involved in constitutive expression of the mouse scgb3a <dig> 

in this study, we demonstrate that a ubiquitous transcription factor nf-y is an important transcription factor for controlling expression of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene through its binding to the responsive "ccaat" element located at - <dig> to - <dig>  and - <dig> to - <dig> bp upstream of the scgb3a <dig> gene. the methylation pattern of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene is examined and the association of the two closest cpgs to the transcription start site in tissue-specific expression of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene is discussed.

RESULTS
analysis of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter
in an attempt to understand the mechanism of mouse scgb3a <dig> gene expression, we first compared the promoter sequence of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene with the human scgb3a <dig> gene. interestingly, no significant homology was found by blast analysis when 2-kbp mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter sequence was subjected to analysis, suggesting that the regulation of human and mouse scgb3a <dig> genes may be quite different. six mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter-luciferase reporter constructs  were then prepared and subjected to transient transfection analysis using transformed mouse clara cells  that are derived from tumor tissues of lungs obtained from transgenic mice expressing the simian virus  <dig> large t antigen gene under control of uteroglobin/clara cell secretory protein promoter  <cit> . the reporter activity slightly increased with construct - <dig> . an approximately ten-fold enhancement of promoter activity as compared to a control construct pgl <dig> was obtained with the - <dig> construct, and the extent of activity remained at similar levels up to - <dig> bp of the promoter sequence. a further robust up-regulation  of the promoter activity as compared to control was obtained with construct - <dig>  suggesting that transcriptional response elements may be present between - <dig> and - <dig> bp, and - <dig> and - <dig> bp of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter. possible binding sites for transcription factors were analyzed using the tf search  <cit> , transfac  <cit>  and the reference of  <cit> . the analysis revealed the presence of two pu boxes  between - <dig> and - <dig> bp and two nf-y binding sites  between - <dig> and - <dig> bp that may be responsible for up-regulation of scgb3a <dig> gene expression . the pu-box is a binding site for the ets family of transcription factors that participate in an array of cellular activities in development, differentiation and tumorigenesis, and is a main regulator of the immune system  <cit> . nf-y is a ubiquitous heterotrimeric transcription factor, composed of nf-ya, nf-yb, and nf-yc, all of which are necessary for dna binding, and recognizes "ccaat" penta-nucleotide element  <cit> . a stat binding site  that we previously characterized  <cit>  for il-4/13-induced increase of scgb3a <dig> expression did not seem to be involved in the constitutive expression of scgb3a <dig>  further tf search analysis with low stringency revealed a possible binding site for gata , c/ebp  and hnf3β , transcription factors known to be involved in lung-specific gene expression  <cit> ; the latter two might contribute a slight increase of the reporter activity found with the - <dig> construct.

nf-y is involved in the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene transcription
the involvement of nf-y in mouse scgb3a <dig> gene transcription was first examined by co-transfecting pgl <dig> control vector, - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> scgb3a1-luciferase constructs with expression plasmids for three nf-y subunits into cos- <dig> cells that do not express scgb3a <dig> . only construct - <dig> has putative nf-y binding sites. luciferase activity increased approximately two-fold with the constructs - <dig> and - <dig>  further inclusion of upstream sequence up to - <dig> bp markedly increased luciferase activity to almost twenty-fold as compared to control, confirming the involvement of nf-y in mouse scgb3a <dig> gene transcription. in order to examine whether all three nf-y subunits are required for expression of scgb3a <dig>  co-transfecting analysis was carried out using single or a various combinations of nf-y subunits . the results clearly demonstrate that all three nf-y subunits are required for scgb3a <dig> gene transcription as previously described  <cit> . further, replacing the nf-ya construct with nf-yam <dig>  a dominant negative form of nf-ya that lacks the dna binding activity due to displacement of three critical amino acids in the middle of the dna binding domain but retaining the ability to form the nf-y heterotrimer  <cit> , nf-y up-regulation of - <dig> luciferase activity was reduced to close to basal levels, suggesting that the nf-ya subunit is critical for transcriptional activation . these results demonstrate that nf-y may activate mouse scgb3a <dig> transcription by binding to the nf-y binding site located between - <dig> and - <dig> bp of the scgb3a <dig> gene promoter.

in the - <dig> to - <dig> bp region, two "ccaat" sequences are present at - <dig> to - <dig> bp and - <dig> to - <dig> bp  from the transcription start site . in order to determine which putative binding sites are involved in binding of nf-y that is responsible for the increase of scgb3a <dig> gene promoter activity, electrophoretic gel mobility shift analysis  was carried out using double strand oligonucleotides containing proximal  or distal  "ccaat" box as a probe and nuclear extracts prepared from cos- <dig> cells over-expressing nf-y, mouse lungs, or mtcc cells . in all three nuclear extracts, the same pattern of specific protein-dna shifted band was obtained, although intensity varied, for both probes  <dig> and  <dig> ; the specific band was competed out by a 200-fold excess of cold probe , but not by an oligonucleotide having a mutation at the "ccaat" site . further, polyclonal anti-nf-y antibody specifically super-shifted the nf-y-dna complex with both probes , which was not seen with igg  or anti- c/ebp antibody  as a negative control. these results demonstrate that nf-y binds to the two "ccaat" binding elements located at - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig> bp in the scgb3a <dig> gene promoter.

in order to determine which nf-y binding element is responsible for scgb3a <dig> gene transactivation, mutant reporter plasmids were constructed by introducing mutations singly or doubly into two of the "ccaat" binding sites in the - <dig> construct . mutations introduced were the same as those used for emsa . when the proximal "ccaat" binding site was mutated , luciferase reporter activity with co-transfection of nf-y expression plasmid was reduced to approximately one-third as compared to wild-type, whereas mut  <dig> having the distal "ccaat" site mutated, displayed about one-half the luciferase activity of wild-type. with both mutations together, luciferase activity was further reduced to approximately one-fourth of that of wild type. these results suggest that the proximal nf-y binding site may be slightly more responsible, however, both nf-y binding sites are required for scgb3a <dig> gene activation.

nf-y is a dominant transcription factor over pu-box binding protein in the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter activity
the role of two pu-boxes  in the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter activity was examined by transfection analysis of mutant constructs in mtcc cells. mutations were introduced into the pu-boxes singly or doubly in the - <dig> and - <dig> constructs, the latter containing two nf-y binding sites . in both - <dig> and - <dig> constructs, pu-box  <dig> and  <dig> individual mutants showed markedly reduced reporter activities at the similar extent in relative to their parent constructs, in which pu-box  <dig> appeared to be more responsible for the promoter activity. the activity was further reduced to a basal level by both mutations together. emsa using mtcc nuclear extracts demonstrated that oligonucleotide containing pu-box  <dig> or  <dig> produced the same specific dna-protein band, which was competed out by a cold probe, but not a mutated probe  . these results suggest that both pu-boxes  <dig> and  <dig> may be required for transcription of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene.

to determine which transcription factor between nf-y and pu-box binding protein is more critical for the regulation of mouse scgb3a <dig> gene, co-transfection experiments were carried out in cos- <dig> cells using the construct - <dig> and - <dig> pu-box1& <dig> double mutant with and without nf-y. while both constructs had very little reporter activity without nf-y , the promoter activity was markedly increased by nf-y over-expression regardless of the presence of pu-box double mutation . the importance of nf-y in mouse scgb3a <dig> gene transcription was further demonstrated by co-transfection into cos- <dig> cells of the - <dig> construct and an expression plasmid for pu. <dig> /spi- <dig>  proviral integration site-1), one of the pu box binding ets family transcription factors  <cit> , although we do not know what ets family member of transcription factor is involved in mouse scgb3a <dig> gene transcription. in this case, scgb3a <dig> promoter activity was slightly increased by the addition of pu.1/spi- <dig> expression plasmid both in the absence and presence of nf-y, however, again the effect of nf-y on the promoter activity was far more robust than the pu-box binding transcription factor . these results suggest that nf-y may be a dominant transcription factor over pu-box binding protein for mouse scgb3a <dig> gene transcription. we therefore focused on nf-y in further studies.

analysis of nf-y binding to its specific binding sites in the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter
in order to further demonstrate that nf-y is a critical transcription factor that binds to the promoter of scgb3a <dig> gene and activates expression of the gene, chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments were carried out using mtcc cells that constitutively express scgb3a <dig>  <cit> , and nih3t <dig> and mouse immortalized respiratory cell-derived mle <dig> cells  <cit>  that do not express scgb3a <dig>  chip analysis demonstrated that nf-y binds to scgb3a <dig> gene promoter in all three cell lines examined regardless of scgb3a <dig> expression . further, when nf-ya shrna was transfected to mtcc cells, the amount of nf-ya protein was reduced to approximately a half as compared to nf-yb subunit, whose level stayed the same after nf-ya shrna transfection . at the same time, scgb3a <dig> mrna levels were reduced to approximately 60% . these results together with the results described above, demonstrate that nf-y is necessary and perhaps sufficient for scgb3a <dig> gene expression through binding to the "ccaat" binding sites located in the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter.

cpg methylation plays a role in the regulation of mouse scgb3a <dig> gene
while nf-y is a ubiquitous factor  <cit>  and binds to the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter, the expression in mouse is mainly found in the trachea and lung  <cit> . in order to understand the mechanism for tissue-specific expression of scg3a <dig>  rt-pcr was first carried out to determine the levels of expression of three nf-y subunits, nf-ya, nf-yb, and nf-yc, and scgb3a <dig> in various mouse tissues including brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen and testis . nf-yb and nf-yc were expressed in all tissues examined at similar levels, whereas expression of the nf-ya subunit varied depending on tissue/cell types as previously described  <cit> : expression in the brain, liver and skeletal muscle was very low or barely detected as compared with other tissues. interestingly, scgb3a <dig> was highly expressed only in the lung with very weak expression detected in the heart. these results confirmed the ubiquitous pattern of nf-y expression, which does not correlate with scgb3a <dig> expression.

in order to understand the tissue-specific expression of scgb3a <dig>  the methylation pattern in the mouse scgb3a <dig> promoter was examined. it is well known that dna methylation plays an important role in tissue-specific gene expression  <cit> . to this end, genomic dna was subjected to bisulfite modification, and the dna fragment spanning - <dig> bp upstream through + <dig> bp in the intron  <dig> of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene was pcr amplified, followed by a direct dna sequencing of the pcr fragment to determine the site of cpg methylation in the promoter and around the transcription start site of the gene. this modification converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil but does not affect 5-methyl cytosine. in the region between + <dig> to - <dig> bp of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene, nine cpg methylation sites were found, all of which were located between nf-y binding sites and the transcription start site . of nine, seven methylation sites located at the most 5' were always methylated regardless of tissues/cell lines examined, whereas two methylation sites closest to the transcription start site were partially or totally unmethylated in lung or mtcc cells, respectively . when  <dig> individual clones obtained from pcr products of bisulfite modified lung dnas were subjected to sequencing,  <dig> were found to have the two cpg sites closest to the transcription start site methylated while  <dig> were unmethylated. these results suggest that lung dnas consist of a mixture of methylated and unmethylated cpgs. note that direct sequencing of dnas from lung, mtcc and nih3t <dig> cells without bisulfite modification did not demonstrate any mutations anywhere within + <dig> to -600-bp region. interestingly, lung and mtcc were the only tissues/cells that exhibited high level of scgb3a <dig> expression. together with the results obtained by chip analysis, in which all mtcc, nih3t <dig>  and mle <dig> cells have bound nf-y at its specific binding sites of the mouse scgb3a <dig> promoter regardless of scgb3a <dig> expression, and that nf-y is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues/cells examined, the bisulfite sequencing results demonstrate that two methylation sites closest to the transcription start site in the scgb3a <dig> promoter may be responsible for tissue-specific expression of scgb3a <dig> 

lastly, in order to examine whether cpg methylation affects binding of dna-binding proteins, we performed emsa using an oligonucleotide having the proximal or distal cpg methylated as compared with unmethylated oligonucleotide . when cpg was methylated, an additional band was observed for both oligonucleotides flanking proximal or distal cpg using nuclear extracts prepared from mtcc and mouse hepatoma-derived hepa <dig> cells. since the shifted band is at different position between two oligonucleotides, they may represent different dna-binding proteins. these results suggest that cpg methylation affects the binding of dna-binding proteins.

discussion
we report here for the first time that a ubiquitous transcription factor nf-y is important for regulation of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene, while dna methylation appears to be associated with tissue-specific expression of the gene. nf-y recognizes a "ccaat" penta-nucleotide that can be found at every  <dig> bp in random genomic dnas based on mathematical calculation. with additional high stringency, in which the "ccaat" box is expanded to a 9-nucleotide element as ccaat  <cit> , this sequence appears every  <dig> kbp in frequency. a "ccaat" box is found in the vicinity of promoter region  with significant high frequency , suggesting that nf-y may play a pivotal role in controlling expression of many genes  <cit> . in the current study, ccaat boxes were located further upstream , away from the vicinity of scgb3a <dig> gene transcription start site.

transfection analysis in cos- <dig> cells revealed that the - <dig> and - <dig> constructs increased reporter activity two-fold in an nf-y dependent manner . however, no "ccaat" binding sequence was found between - <dig> bp and the transcription start site, nor did emsa reveal any nf-y binding in this region . while an exact "ccaat" sequence is required for nf-y binding, "ccact" sequence was reported to similarly function as the nf-y binding site in regulation of oncoprotein <dig> gene  <cit> . a low stringency survey revealed the presence of two "ccact" sequences in the scgb3a <dig> gene promoter at - <dig> to - <dig> bp and - <dig> to - <dig> bp, however, neither bound nf-y as determined by emsa . further, when nfyam <dig>  a dominant negative form of nf-ya was co-transfected with the constructs - <dig>  an approximately two-fold higher luciferase activity as compared to control remained even though a heterotrimer with nf-yam <dig> cannot bind dna   <cit> . moreover, mutation of the two nf-y binding sites did not completely abolish nf-y activation of the - <dig> construct luciferase activity . the exact reason for these phenomena is not known. however, it has been established that nf-y interacts with tata-binding protein   <cit> , tfiid  <cit> , and coactivators such as p <dig>  <cit>  and p/caf  <cit>  that modify gene expression. the interaction of nf-y with these factors could stabilize basic transcription machinery and/or its association with dna, which in turn results in a slight increase in scgb3a <dig> reporter activity with co-transfection of constructs - <dig> and nf-yam <dig>  and/or the constructs -59/- <dig> and nf-y expression plasmid. note that in these reporter assays, three expression constructs, nf-ya, nf-yb, and nf-yc were simultaneously co-transfected along with a reporter construct. the fact that only cells that have taken up all four plasmids can produce a complete form of nf-y that can activate the promoter suggests that the 20-fold increase of scgb3a <dig> promoter activity obtained in this co-transfection assay system may represent only a fraction of naturally occurring nf-y regulated scgb3a <dig> expression.

the importance of nf-y, in particular the nf-ya subunit in mouse scgb3a <dig> gene expression was demonstrated by reporter activities using a various combination of nf-y subunits and reduced scgb3a <dig> mrna expression by nf-ya shrna. in the latter, both nf-ya protein and scgb3a <dig> mrna levels were suppressed at similar levels of approximately 50–60% of the control. this incomplete suppression may be due to the fact that nf-y is a ubiquitous transcription factor and regulates many genes including housekeeping genes and those involved in cell cycle control, that account for approximately 20% of all genes  <cit> . thus, complete suppression of nf-y expression may likely result in suppression of cell proliferation and cell death. indeed, a knockout mouse for nf-ya is embryonic lethal, and embryonic fibroblasts prepared from this mouse demonstrate halted cell proliferation and dna synthesis  <cit> .

an important factor controlling tissue-specific expression of genes is cpg methylation  <cit> . this may particularly play a role in suppressing expression of nf-y-responsive genes in many tissues since nf-y is ubiquitously expressed  <cit>  and is responsible for recruitment of rna polymerase ii  <cit> . however, the possibility exists that nf-y may cooperate with another transcription factor, which could render expression of genes tissue and/or stage-specific. for instance, nf-y and c/ebpα interact with each other and synergistically activate the mouse amelogenin gene, which contributes to physiological regulation during amelogenesis  <cit> . whether this could be the case in the regulation of mouse scgb3a <dig> gene expression remains to be determined.

dna methylation is known to suppress gene expression through two basic mechanisms  <cit> ; first, methylation of cytosine bases inhibit association between dna-binding factors and their cognate dna recognition sequences, resulting in direct inhibition of transcriptional activation. second, proteins that recognize methyl-cpg such as methyl-cpg-binding proteins elicit repressive potential of methylated dna by recruiting co-repressor molecules to silence gene transcription and to modify surrounding chromatin, including histone modification. in the case of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene, the second mechanism most likely plays a role in silencing expression of the gene since two cpgs are located closest to the transcription start site, which is 3– <dig> bp downstream of the nf-y binding sites. these two cpgs in the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter are partially or completely unmethylated in mouse lung and mtcc cells, respectively. the partial methylation observed in the lung is the result of a mixture of methylated and unmethylated cpgs at approximately a 1: <dig> ratio. although we do not have a proof, the methylated cpgs might be at least partially derived from non-epithelial cells such as mesenchymal cells that are contained in whole lung from which genomic dna for methylation analysis was prepared. we found that the two cpgs were totally methylated when embryonic lung mesenchymal cells that do not express scgb3a <dig> were separately prepared from epithelial cells and subjected to sequencing . scgb3a <dig> is known to be expressed only in the airway epithelium  <cit> . however, very low scgb3a <dig> expression was observed in the heart even though the two cpgs closest to the transcription start site were methylated. the reason for this difference is not known. a small percentage of these cpgs might be unmethylated in a specific part of the heart and not abundant enough to be detected particularly using mrna prepared from whole heart. in this regard, the expression site in the heart is not known. alternatively, another transcription factor enriched in the heart might be responsible for the low scgb3a <dig> expression in this tissue. emsa using methylated cpg oligonucleotides revealed the presence of additional shifted bands as compared to unmethylated oligonucleotides. this could be due to binding of one of the methyl-cpg-binding proteins  <cit>  or other dna-binding proteins  to these sites. we do not know which methyl-cpg-binding protein or dna-binding protein is responsible for the new band, however the results at least suggest that cpg methylation affects binding of dna-binding proteins within the region around proximal and distal cpgs in the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter. previously we reported that a stat binding element located at -201- to - <dig> bp of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter is responsible for the il-3/14-induced increase of scgb3a <dig> gene expression in mtcc and mouse embryo lung primary cells  <cit> . this stat element is located to close to the 3' most methylated cpg. whether any changes in methylation status in this cpg under il-3/ <dig> induction remains to be determined.

lastly, in the human scgb3a <dig> gene promoter,  <dig> potential methylation cpg sites are found within  <dig>  bp of the promoter region  <cit> . high frequency of methylation of these cpgs is associated with loss of scgb3a <dig> expression in many human cancers  <cit> . in contrast, there are only  <dig> cpgs within  <dig> bp of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene promoter. this remarkable species difference in cpg islands can be explained by little significant homology in dna sequences between the human and mouse gene promoters, suggesting that mouse scgb3a <dig> and human scgb3a <dig> may be under different regulation. this could explain the different patterns of scgb3a <dig> expression between these two species. whether the difference in gene regulation has any implication in functional role of scgb3a <dig> between mouse and human requires additional studies.

CONCLUSIONS
a ubiquitous transcription factor, nf-y appears to be a potential potent regulator of mouse scgb3a <dig> gene expression through binding to two "ccaat" boxes located at - <dig> to - <dig>  and - <dig> to - <dig> bp in the scgb3a <dig> gene promoter. tissue-specific expression of scgb3a <dig> may be due in part to methylation of the two cpg sites closest to the transcription start site of the gene.
