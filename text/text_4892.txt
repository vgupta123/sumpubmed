BACKGROUND
photorhabdus are a genus of bioluminescent, entomopathogenic bacteria that are members of the family enterobacteriaceae and are thus closely related to escherichia coli and other important mammalian pathogens. as part of their normal life-cycle photorhabdus also have a mutualistic interaction with nematodes from the family heterorhabditis . the bacteria are normally found colonizing the gut of the infective juvenile  stage of the nematode. the ij is the free-living infective stage of the nematode that is found in the soil and actively searches for potential insect larvae to infect. once identified the ij enters the insect through natural openings such as the mouth, anus or spiracles or the ij can use a small tooth-like appendage to tear the cuticle and gain direct entry into the hemolymph. once inside the insect the ij migrates to the hemolymph where unidentified signals stimulate the ij to regurgitate the bacteria. the bacteria avoid the insect immune response and grow exponentially within the insect until the insect succumbs to septicimeia within 48- <dig> h of infection  <cit> . at this point all of the internal organs of the insect have been converted into bacterial biomass. this bioconversion is facilitated by a range of hydrolytic enzymes that are secreted by photorhabdus, including proteases and lipases. in the presence of high densities of photorhabdus the ij is stimulated to recover to a self-fertile adult hermaphrodite and this is the start of nematode reproduction. the hermaphrodite lays eggs and the developing nematode larvae feed on the bacteria present in the insect. as in caenorhabditis elegans, the heterorhabditis nematodes develop through  <dig> juvenile stages  before becoming adults  <cit> . nematode reproduction continues for 2- <dig> generations until unidentified environmental stimuli triggers the formation of an alternative j <dig> nematode, the ij, which exits the insect cadaver. before leaving the insect cadaver the new ij must be colonized by photorhabdus and transmission of the bacteria to the ij is a complex process that has only recently been phenomonologically described  <cit> . there are  <dig> striking features associated with the transmission process: 1) the colonization of the rectal gland cells of the adult hermaphrodite by photorhabdus and 2) the observation that all ijs develop inside the adult hermaphrodite in a process called endotokia matricida. therefore the bacteria that colonize the adult hermaphrodite are ultimately responsible for the colonization of the ij  <cit> .

the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission process are poorly understood. in the only previous published study that reports a gene involved in transmission it was shown that a mutation in a gene annotated as pbge <dig> severely affects the ability of photorhabdus to colonize the ij  <cit> . this mutant was isolated during a screen for genes affecting swimming motility and the pbge <dig> mutant was also shown to be severely attenuated in virulence. the pbge <dig> gene is predicted to be part of a  <dig> gene pbgpe operon that is homologous to the arn operon in salmonella  <cit> . the arn operon has been shown to be involved in the modification of the lipid a moiety of lps with l-aminoarabinose in response to the presence of cationic antimicrobial peptides   <cit> . the pbge <dig> mutant did produce altered lps compared to the wild-type implicating lps structure as a nematode colonization factor in photorhabdus  <cit> . in this study we screened a library of photorhabdus mutants with the aim of extending our understanding of the transmission process by identifying genes important in the colonization of the h. bacteriophora ij nematode by p. luminescens tt <dig> 

RESULTS
construction of a gfp-tagged strain of p. luminescens tt01
in order to facilitate a relatively rapid screening method for the identification of transmission mutants we decided to tag tt <dig> with a constitutively expressed gfp using a mini-tn <dig> transposon . this would enable the translucent ijs to be viewed beneath a fluorescent microscope and be scored qualitatively for the presence/absence of bacteria. colonies of the gfp-tagged strain  were initially checked for fluorescence using a uv light box before overnight cultures were checked for gfp expression using a fluorescent microscope. this confirmed that the vast majority of cells in an overnight population of tt01gfp were expressing gfp . phenotypic comparisons of tt <dig> and tt01gfp confirmed that there was no difference in growth rate, bioluminescence, pigmentation or virulence to insect larvae. furthermore we also verified that tt01gfp was able to colonize ij nematodes  with a transmission frequency identical to tt <dig> . as has been previously shown, the tt01gfp bacteria were confirmed to occupy the proximal region of the nematode gut extending from just below the pharynx of the ij .

identification of tt01gfp mutants affected in colonization of the ij
in this study we were using a qualitative screen that was designed to identify mutants that were affected in transmission frequency i.e. we were looking for mutants that colonized significantly fewer ijs than the 80% level observed with tt01gfp. therefore tt01gfp was subjected to transposon mutagenesis using the tn <dig> interposon delivered by plasmid put-km <dig> and individual mutants were arrayed into  <dig> well plates and frozen. from this arrayed library  <dig> mutants were screened for a defect in transmission frequency by growing the mutant on a lipid agar plate and inoculating the biomass with  <dig> surface-sterilized h. bacteriophora ijs. after  <dig> days incubation the new generation of ijs were collected and checked for colonization using a fluorescent microscope. in this way  <dig> mutants were identified as having a qualitative defect in transmission frequency i.e. <50% of the ijs were observed to be colonized by the mutant bacteria. each mutant was then re-screened  and approximately  <dig> ijs in total from each mutant were individually examined using fluorescence in order to get a quantitative measure of transmission frequency. as a result we identified  <dig> mutants that reproducibly gave transmission frequencies of <35% . the gene that was interrupted in each mutant was identified  and the loci affected are shown in figure  <dig>  mutants # <dig> e <dig> and # <dig> f <dig> were both identified as interuptions in pbge <dig>  a gene involved in lps biosynthesis and part of an operon, the pbgpe operon, previoulsy identified as being important for ij colonization  <cit> . the pbgpe operon is predicted to be involved in modification of the lipid a moiety of lps with l-aminoarabinose. interestingly we also identifed a mutation in the downstream gene, pbge <dig>  confirming a key role for this operon in ij colonization. from this group of  <dig> mutants we used mutant # <dig> f <dig> for all further analysis. mutants # <dig> d <dig> and # <dig> e <dig> were identified as interuptions of gale and galu respectively. the gale gene is predicted to encode udp-glucose 4-epimerase and galu is predicted to encode glucose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. both of these activities are important in the production of polysaccharides including o-antigen  <cit> . mutant # <dig> f <dig> was identified as an interuption of a gene with homology to the asma gene in e. coli. the asma protein is localised to the outer membrane of e. coli and mutations in this gene resulted in significantly lower levels of lps  <cit> . mutant # <dig> g <dig> was identified as an interuption of a gene with homology to hdfr in e. coli. the hdfr gene has been shown to repress flhdc expression, and thus motility, in e. coli  <cit> . finally mutant # <dig> d <dig> was shown to be an interuption of gene with homolgy to proq from e. coli. in e. coli proq encodes a protein that modifies the activity of prop, a mfs transporter involved in the adaptation of the cell to osmotic stress  <cit> . however we could not identify a prop homologue on the genome of tt <dig> suggesting a different role for proq in this bacterium.

attachment of mutants to abiotic surfaces
previous transmisson electron microscopy of photorhabdus within the gut of the ij had revealed features of the bacterial population that resembled growth as a biofilm i.e. the bacteria were seen to be in close association with the epithelial cells of the gut and encased in a matrix of unidentified composition  <cit> . therefore we wanted to determine if any of the mutants defective in transmission to the ij were affected in biofilm formation, as measured by attachment to an abiotic surface. the mutants were grown in the wells of a polypropylene  microtitre plate for  <dig> h and the attached biomass was measured using crystal violet . as can be seen only  <dig> mutants were affected in their ability to attach to pp, proq and galu . all other mutants appeared to be unaffected in biofilm formation suggesting that colonization of the ij and attachment to abiotic surfaces have distinct  genetic requirements.

virulence of mutants to insect larvae
photorhabdus is highly virulent to insect larvae and previous work had shown that mutants affected in their ability to colonize ijs were also affected in their virulence to insects  <cit> . therefore  <dig> cfu of each of the mutants was injected into  <dig> final instar larva of the greater wax moth  and insect death was assessed by gently prodding the insects at different time points post-infection. as expected the lt <dig> of tt01gfp was observed to be approximately 45- <dig> h . this was similar to the lt50's of the proq, hdfr and asma mutants suggesting that these genes are not important during virulence. we had previously shown that a mutation in the pbgpe operon was avirulent and this has now been confirmed in this study . in addition the gale and galu mutants appeared to be completely avirulent under the conditions tested here implying an important role for polysaccharide production during virulence .

sensitivity of mutants to polymyxin b
insects have a sophisticated innate immune system that includes the production of camps  <cit> . one mechanism employed by bacteria to adapt to, and resist, the presence of camps is to reduce the net negative charge associated with the lps present in their outer membrane. this can be achieved by, amongst other means, replacing a negatively charged phosphate group on the lipid a moiety of the lps with a positively charged l-aminoarabinose. in salmonella and e. coli this modification is carried out by the products of the arnbcadtfe operon   <cit> . in p. luminescens the closest homologue to the arnbcadtfe operon is annotated as the pbgpe operon and we have previously shown that a mutation in this operon is hyper-sensitive to the presence of the camp, polymyxin b  <cit> . the pbgpe mutant is also avirulent to insects and unable to colonize the ij suggesting a correlation between resistance to camp and the colonization of hosts  <cit> . to test this correlation further we analysed the ability of each of the mutants to grow in the presence of  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> polymyxin b. all of the mutants grew with the same growth rate as tt01gfp in lb broth without added pb . however in the presence of polymyxin b the mutants could be divided into  <dig> groups based on the shape of their growth curve . both tt01gfp and the proq mutant had very similar growth curves with a lag phase of approximately  <dig> h during which time it is likely that the cells are adapting to the prescene of the polymyxin b. the hdfr and asma mutants were apparently slower to adapt and the lag time was extended to  <dig> h before the cells began exponential growth. finally the pbge <dig>  gale and galu mutants did not show any growth in the presence of polymyxin b suggesting that these cells were unable to adapt to the presence of the camp.

discussion
in this study we screened over  <dig> mutants of a gfp-tagged strain of p. luminescens tt <dig> for mutants that were reduced in their ability to colonize the guts of the ij nematode i.e. transmission mutants. in total we identified  <dig> mutants in  <dig> different genetic loci: the pbgpe operon, gale, galu, asma, hdfr and proq. the transmission frequency of the identified mutants was between 10-30% indicating that none of these genes were required for colonization but, rather, somehow the genes improved the ability of the bacteria to colonize the ij. moreover, in those ijs that were colonized, the level of fluorescence observed suggested that the nematodes were carrying the full population of bacteria . however we did not test for this directly by crushing and plating individual ijs.

the pbgpe operon is predicted to contain  <dig> genes, pbgp1234pbge <dig>  and in this study we identified mutations in both pbge <dig> and pbge <dig> that were affected in their ability to colonize nematodes. this work confirms an earlier study where we reported that a mutation in pbge <dig> was important for both insect virulence and colonization of the ij  <cit> . in this previous study we reported that the level of colonization of the pbge <dig> mutant was 1% of the wild-type, in contrast to the 10-30% level reported here for the different mutations identified in the pbgpe operon . the reason for this difference is not clear but it is nonetheless evident that the pbgpe operon plays an important role in the colonization of both the insect and the nematode.

in this study we demonstrated that mutations in galu and gale were affected in their ability to colonize the ij. these genes are predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of udp-glucose and udp-galactose, respectively, important precursors in the production of polysaccharides. the galu gene is predicted to encode glucose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase and is required for the production of udp-glucose, an important glucosyl donor in the cell. in salmonella udp-glucose is required for the production of udp-arabinose which is used to synthesise l-aminoarabinose for the modification of lipid a in response to camps  <cit> . we have shown that the galu mutant does phenocopy the pbge <dig> mutation suggesting that the galu defect may be explained by the associated defects in l-aminoarabinose biosynthesis. however we have also shown that, in contrast to the pbge <dig> mutant, the galu mutant is defective in attachment to abiotic surfaces  suggesting that the galu mutation is pleitropic. indeed, in e. coli, a mutation in galu would also be expected to prevent production of the lps-associated o-antigen  <cit> . in addition to lps synthesis, udpglucose also plays a role in protecting e. coli against thermal and osmotic shocks ) and the negative regulation of σs, the stationary-phase sigma factor  <cit> .

however we have shown that σs is not required for either virulence or ij colonization by p. luminescens  implying that udp-glucose is important in colonization through its role in polysaccharide biosynthesis. the gale gene is predicted to encode udp-glucose-4-epimerase, an enzyme responsible for the interconversion of udp-glucose and udp-galactose. p. luminescens does not catabolise galactose  suggesting that the main role of gale is in the production of udp-galactose from udp-glucose. in e. coli both gale and galu are required for the production of lps o-antigen  <cit>  and, although the structure of the o-antigen is not known in photorhabdus, it seems plausible that both udp-glucose and udp-galactose will be required for o-antigen biosynthesis. indeed, given that the galu and gale mutants in p. luminescens are both avirulent to insects, sensitive to camps and defective in colonization of the ij, it seems likely that these mutants are affected in the same pathway i.e. lps biosynthesis. nonetheless it is interesting to note that, in contrast to the galu mutant, the gale mutant is not affected in attachment to an abiotic surface . however this can be simply explained if, as expected, mutations in gale and galu  result in slightly different lps molecules.

our identification of mutants in pbgpe, gale and galu clearly implicates lps as an important player in the colonization of the ij by photorhabdus. in this study we also identified mutations in genes that were not directly associated with lps metabolism; asma, hdfr and proq. the asma gene was originally identified in e. coli as a site for suppressor mutations of an assembly defective porin, ompf <dig>  <cit> . although the role of asma is still not clear it is likley that this protein is involved in organising the outer membrane. in the first instance a mutation in asma has been shown to result in reduced levels of lps in the outer membrane of e. coli  <cit> . in addition a recent study reported that a mutation in asma in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium resulted in a remodelling of the outer membrane that resulted in an increase in the transcription of marab, encoding a multi-drug efflux pump  <cit> . the authors further report that the s. enterica asma mutant was attenuated in virulence when administered orally to mice and showed a reduced ability to invade epithelial cells thus linking asma with infection  <cit> . the hdfr gene was originally annotated as  <dig> overlapping genes, yifa and pssr, on the e. coli genome but recent analysis confirmed the presence of a sequencing error that resulted in a frameshift and the subsequent mis-annotation  <cit> . the hdfr gene is predicted to encode a lysr-type regulator that represses the expression of flhdc, and therefore motility, in e. coli  <cit> . in proteus mirabilis  <dig> independent mutations in hdfr were identified in a stm experiment as being important for urinary tract colonization in mice  <cit> . motility has been shown to play an important role in p. mirabilis virulence however a role for hdfr in regulating motility in proteus has not been determined  <cit> . interestingly we have shown that the hdfr mutant does not appear to affect swimming motility in p. luminescens . finally we identified a mutation in the proq gene. this gene is predicted to encode a protein that, in e. coli, is involved in the post-translational activation of prop, an osmoprotectant/proton symporter that is capable of transporting both proline and glycine betaine in response to increases in osmotic pressure  <cit> . however the genome of p. luminescens is not predicted to encode a prop homologue suggesting an alternative role for proq in photorhabdus.

interestingly the proq mutant was the most affected in attachment to an abiotic surface suggesting alterations in the cell surface of the mutant . however the proq mutant was not sensitive to camps suggesting that the lps was not affected . it is also noteworthy that, unlike the other mutants identified in this study, there is the possibility that the mutation in proq has a polar affect on the downstream gene, prc . the proq and prc genes are separated by  <dig> bp on both the e. coli and p. luminescens genomes and proq and prc are predicted to be on the same transcription unit in e. coli http://ecocyc.org. the prc gene encodes a periplamsic protease called prc or tsp  that processes the c-terminus of ftsi  and is required for protection from combined osmotic and thermal stress  <cit> . moreover prc has been shown to interact with nlpi, a lipoprotein that has recently been shown to be involved in the attachment of adherent-invasive e. coli  to epithelial cells  <cit> . in addition, in pseudomonas aeruginosa, prc has been implicated in the regulation of alginate production by degrading mutant forms of muca, the anti-sigma factor that interacts with the alternative sigma factor algu  <cit> . therefore a decrease in the level of prc transcription may affect the surface of photorhabdus in a way that prevents colonization of the ij. however further experimentation is required to determine whether the proq or prc gene  are responsible for the reported phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> genetic loci in p. luminescens tt <dig> that are affected in their ability to colonize ijs of the nematode h. bacteriophora. in order to have a reduced transmission frequency it would be expected that the mutants would be affected in either their ability to infect and replicate within the adult hermpahrodite or in their ability to colonize the ij. preliminarly studies, using confocal laser scanning microscopy , suggest that all of the mutants are able to infect the adult hermaphrodite . therefore the defect in colonization appears to occur at some point later during the transmission process. it has been shown that colonization of the ij requires binding to the pre-intestinal valve cell in the immature ij followed by growth and replication of the bacteria in the gut lumen  <cit> . all of the mutants identified in this study can be implicated in the maintenance of the structure and/or remodelling the bacterial cell surface and it is, therefore, easy to envisage how mutations affecting the cell surface of p. luminescens could affect how the bacteria interact with the ij. the exact stage and nature of the colonization defect of each mutant is currently under examination.
