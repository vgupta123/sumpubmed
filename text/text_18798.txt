BACKGROUND
adolescence is a critical transitional stage during which youth mature into adulthood. this developmental stage is characterized by a continued brain remodeling, a process that is sensitive to the disrupting effects of alcohol  <cit> . epidemiological studies indicate that adolescence is a developmental stage particularly vulnerable to alcohol drinking-related problems and the onset of alcoholism  <cit> .

the brain is one of the major target organs of alcohol. excessive alcohol exposure can lead to structural and functional changes of the brain  <cit> , resulting in malfunctioning of the cns activity, as well as deleterious influence of bodily function  <cit> .

hypothalamus is one of the alcohol-sensitive brain regions  <cit> . being a key brain region for food and water intake regulation  <cit>  and part of the reward system  <cit> , the hypothalamus can modulate alcohol consumption and is involved in the development of alcoholism. it has been shown that stimulation of lateral hypothalamic regions could trigger alcohol consumption  <cit> . neuropeptides that are found in the hypothalamus could stimulate alcohol intake  <cit> .

conversely, alcohol can also affect hypothalamic activities. alcohol is known to activate the hpa axis  <cit> . it is likely that by modifying the activity of the hpa axis, alcohol will influence, and possibly compromise, the ability of the body to maintain or restore homeostasis and to coordinate appropriate behavioral responses in response to stressors  <cit> . in alcohol-dependent subjects, dopamine d <dig> receptor  binding in the hypothalamus was increased  <cit> . alcohol alters genes expression of lhrh secretory pathway in the hypothalamus of prepubertal female rats, resulting in suppressed lhrh secretion and delayed puberty  <cit> . the expression of hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin  gene was reduced by prenatal exposure to alcohol in rats  <cit> , and the pomc expression reduction persisted into adulthood by postnatal alcohol feeding in mice  <cit> . the expression of fos-related immediate early genes was altered following chronic alcohol administration in mice and rats  <cit> .

aside from alcohol, other substances of abuse potential have been shown to influence gene activity in the hypothalamus. thus, cocaine increased pomc gene expression in rat hypothalamus  <cit> , and escalated cocaine intake correlated with a number of genes in the lateral hypothalamic regions  <cit> . nicotine exposure was shown to affect brain development, corresponding to abnormal hypothalamic gene expression of appetite regulators such as down-regulation of npy and pomc in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus  <cit> .

hypothalamus also plays a role in autonomic modulation of cardiovascular system. sympathetic nervous system can also be activated by alcohol, and chronic exposure of the heart to elevated catecholamine levels released from sympathetic nerve terminals may result in pathological changes of the heart  <cit> .

studies of the effect of chronic alcohol exposure on the hypothalamus have been limited, particularly at the level of gene expression changes. specifically, it is not known what would be the alcohol effect on hypothalamus following adolescent alcohol intake, chronically over the adolescent development, at moderate levels. in the present study, we employed a paradigm of chronic moderate alcohol intake from adolescence-to-adulthood in mice  <cit> , and report here the alcohol effect on both behavioral and hypothalamic gene expression changes.

RESULTS
chronic alcohol consumption
we used a two-bottle free-choice paradigm to measure alcohol drinking  <cit> , and studied effect of chronic alcohol consumption during adolescent development. male adolescent mice  were divided into two alcohol groups, one with free access to 5% alcohol, and the other to 10% alcohol, so as to determine if there was a difference in alcohol consumption behavior due to difference in alcohol concentration. in addition, a water-only control group  was used. figure 1a showed the results of daily alcohol consumption  for the 5% alcohol group  and the 10% alcohol group . both groups of mice consumed similar amounts of alcohol, and there was no statistically significant difference  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , two-way anova with bonferroni post-test). figure 1b plotted alcohol preference  from the same mouse alcohol groups, showing that mice from the 5% alcohol group consumed higher volume of alcohol solution than those from the 10% alcohol group. since the 10% alcohol solution contained higher amount of alcohol per unit volume than the 5% alcohol solution, we calculated the absolute amounts of alcohol consumption by mice from both the 5% alcohol group and the 10% alcohol group, and found that there was no significant difference for the absolute amount of alcohol consumed between the 5% vs. 10% alcohol groups.

because there was no significant difference for the daily alcohol consumption between the 5% and the 10% alcohol groups, we combined mice from the 5% and 10% alcohol groups, to analyze the overall pattern of alcohol consumption . over the course of adolescent alcohol exposure, a trend of increased alcohol consumption was observed, with alcohol consumption data from later time points  significantly different from those in the earlier time points . average daily alcohol consumption over the duration of the entire procedure  was  <dig>  g/kg/day, and for the last 5 days  it was  <dig>  g/kg/day. these amounts of daily alcohol consumption represent a moderate level of alcohol consumption .

evaluation of motor activities indicated that chronic alcohol mice displayed accelerated acclimation for motor activities . this is consistent with reported alcohol exposure-induced locomotor activity changes  <cit> .

gene expression changes after chronic alcohol exposure
for brain tissue processing for gene expression analysis,  <dig> mice with 7 weeks alcohol exposure were selected and grouped into alcohol sample groups . samples a1-a <dig> had mice with relatively less alcohol consumed ; samples a4-a <dig> had mice with relatively more alcohol consumed ; these were significantly different . the rationale for such an approach of sample pooling was to cover the spectrum of mouse alcohol consumption behavior, so that the underlying gene expression patterns may be discernible. for water-only controls, nine mice were selected randomly, and grouped into water sample groups , designated samples c1-c <dig> 

rna samples extracted from hypothalamus were used in gene expression analysis, using the agilent mouse whole genome microarray chip set. data from all probe sets  were used in principal component analysis . results of pca were shown in figure  <dig>  showing different distribution patterns of alcohol mice vs. water mice. for component a from pca, both water controls and chronic alcohol mice showed results centered around the  <dig> axis. however, while the component a results from water samples were tightly grouped around the  <dig> axis, that from chronic alcohol mice were spread more widely, indicating more heterogeneity in gene expression represented in component a. for component b, results from water controls were tightly grouped above positive  <dig> level, while most  alcohol samples were near  or in the negative value range. the distribution pattern highlighted the fact that chronic alcohol consumption mice had very different gene expression patterns compared to the water controls, indicating that chronic alcohol exposure during adolescent development lead to altered gene expression in the hypothalamus.

significant differences in gene expression were observed between chronic alcohol exposure and water controls, with  <dig> regulated probes representing  <dig> genes  using the t-test at the p <  <dig>  . unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on these differentially expressed genes also showed distinct clustering of the alcohol hypothalamus samples compared with control hypothalamus samples .

pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes
of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> genes showed less than  <dig>  fold change  and  <dig> genes showed more than  <dig>  fold change . these  <dig> genes were chosen for pathway analysis, and several pathways were identified . one pathway showed p <  <dig>  — the dilated cardiomyopathy pathway, from the pathway enrichment analysis by both david functional classification analysis and web-based gene set analysis, and was chosen for further studies.

validation of microarray results by real-time pcr
to provide independent validation of the identified gene pathway from microarray analysis of gene expression data, real-time pcr was used to measure gene expression level changes with the same rna samples used in the microarray experiment. we studied ten genes in the dilated cardiomyopathy  pathway that were identified as differentially expressed genes , as well as two other genes in the dcm pathway with “borderline” difference  because of their key positions in the dcm pathway; in addition, jup was tested, as an internal control, because it was among those identified by microarray analysis, but was not situated in the β1ar-dhpr-ca2+ branch of the dcm pathway. seven candidate genes among the thirteen tested were validated by real-time pcr as differentially expressed genes, giving a  <dig> % positive confirmation rate. table  <dig> lists the seven genes that showed significantly differentiated expression between the chronic alcohol samples and the water control samples: adrb <dig>  gnas, adcy <dig>  cacna1d, and itga <dig> with down-regulation, while des and igf <dig> with up-regulation. interestingly, the four genes with the strongest statistical difference  all showed down-regulation, and they all code for proteins which initiate the signaling steps in the β1ar-dhpr-ca2+ branch of the dcm pathway , suggesting that this branch may be impacted by chronic alcohol consumption during adolescence.

discussion
in this study, we used mice to study chronic alcohol consumption during adolescence and its effect on gene expression and behavior in adulthood. we selected icr mice for this study, instead of the more commonly used c57bl <dig> mice, for two reasons:  icr mouse is an outbred mouse strain with inter-individual variability — similar to the outbred nature of humans. using an outbred mouse strain such as icr to study alcohol effect would more closely model the effect of alcohol in humans.  as an inbred strain, c57bl <dig> mice are known to drink considerably more alcohol than other mouse strains  <cit> . thus, c57bl <dig> mice may represent only a special case regarding alcohol drinking behavior. outbred mice such as icr have been shown to consume less alcohol and exhibit lower preference for alcohol than c57bl <dig> mice  <cit> ; in a preference test with 3% – 30% alcohol, the mean maximally preferred concentrations of alcohol were approximately 18% for c57bl <dig> mice vs. 7% for icr mice  <cit> . we chose a two-bottle free-choice paradigm to measure alcohol drinking, as animals have unrestricted access to both water and alcohol for their own choice, thus better modeling the free-choice nature of human access to alcohol; such an approach has been used to identify the genetic basis for alcohol preference and dependence  <cit> .

in our study, mice started chronic alcohol drinking from the age of about 4 weeks old and lasted seven weeks, covering the entire period of adolescence-to-adulthood development in mice. during this time, a trend of increased alcohol consumption was observed , with an overall average alcohol consumption of  <dig>  g/kg/day. this represents a moderate level of alcohol consumption, as it is comparable to the lower range of alcohol intake in a cross-mouse strain study of alcohol intake during the 4-hour daily drinking session using the drinking-in-the-dark model  <cit> . using fda’s guidance for conversion of animal doses to human equivalent doses  based on body surface area  <cit> , this level of alcohol consumption in mouse is roughly equivalent to about 1– <dig> glasses of wine in a 60 kg adult human. interestingly, such a relatively moderate level of alcohol drinking during adolescent development still resulted in a pattern of gene expression change in hypothalamus; in particular, for certain genes that have been shown to be involved in the dilated cardiomyopathy .

adolescent chronic alcohol intake in mice results in a pattern of gene regulation in the hypothalamus
our results showed that chronic alcohol intake influences hypothalamic gene expression. from our microarray analysis of hypothalamic gene expression,  <dig>  genes showed significant changes, of which  <dig> displaying gene expression change of  <dig>  fold or higher. pca  and clustering analysis  showed that, compared with water controls, alcohol intake in mice displayed a pattern of hypothalamic gene expression changes. using pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes, we found that dilated cardiomyopathy  pathway is one of the major pathways that was affected by chronic alcohol intake. using rt-pcr, five genes in the dcm pathway  are down-regulated in chronic alcohol mice relative to water controls, and two genes were up-regulated  . of the five down-regulated genes, four of them  belong to the β1ar-dhpr-ca2+ branch of the dcm pathway . the functions of these gene products are closely related: β-adrenergic receptors are coupled to g proteins including gnas, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase, and results in increased camp levels. the primary target for camp is protein kinase a, which phosphorylates several proteins including cacna1d, which regulates ca2+ influx into the cytosol from intracellular ca2+ stores endoplasmic reticulum in neurons and sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac myocytes. what these genes share in common is that they all code for proteins which initiate the signaling steps of this pathway. thus, we term these gene products “signaling pathway initiating factors” .

our results corroborate with evidence from human and rodent studies where chronic alcohol treatment was used. in human, chronic alcoholism was shown to be related to the reduced gsα levels in the temporal cortices of postmortem brains  <cit> . also, postmortem brains of alcoholics showed a significant reduction of adenylyl cyclase  <dig> in both frontal and temporal cortices  <cit> . in addition, adenylyl cyclase mrna levels in the blood were significantly lower in alcoholics than in controls  <cit> . cyclic amp levels were also decreased in lymphocytes of alcoholics  <cit> . some of these molecular effects appear long-lasting. for example, in platelet membranes, adenylyl cyclase activity was lower in alcoholics who had abstained from alcohol for one to four years  <cit> .

in rodents treated with chronic alcohol, it has been shown that in myocardial membranes, β-adrenergic receptor and camp levels were decreased  <cit> , similar to our observations at the mrna levels of these proteins . in addition, β-adrenergic receptor density in the heart was decreased by alcohol exposure  <cit> . there are also ample evidence of chronic alcohol-related reduction in rodents for adenylyl cyclase and g proteins in the cns, including cerebral cortex  <cit> , pituitary  <cit> , and cerebellum and pons  <cit> . these reports demonstrate that chronic alcohol treatment in vivo show a consistent pattern of reduction in β- <dig> adrenergic receptor, g protein, and adenylyl cyclase, consistent with our observations for the spifs, and suggesting that alcohol-induced impairment of these spifs may represent a rather common pathophysiological outcome from chronic alcohol exposure.

of the down-regulated spif genes in the dcm pathway, the activity and function of cacna1d in the hypothalamus was not well-understood. cacna1d encodes the voltage-gated l-type ca2+ channel formed by a1d subunits. ca2+ channel involvement in cardiovascular function is known. for example, mice deficient of the alpha-1d subunit of the ca2+ channel showed bradycardia and arrhythmia as a result of the sinoatrial node dysfunction  <cit> . d-ltcc channels are present in the atrial tissues of the heart where it contributes to pace-making  <cit> . d-ltcc channel opening results in ca2+ influx, which activities ryanodine receptor, thus mediating ca2+ release from intracellular ca2+ stores such as sarcoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , leading to cardiac muscle contraction. in the brain, d-ltcc channels are important in regulating neuronal activity  <cit> . in hippocampus, for example, these channels are involved in both long-term potentiation and long-term depression by coupling with ryanodine receptors  <cit> . these ca2+ channel functions in the hypothalamus are little understood, however.

potential relationship between the hypothalamic gene regulation pattern and alcohol-induced cardiovascular disease
regarding hypothalamic gene expression influenced by alcohol, there lacks reported studies about the four spif genes we studied. based on the above-cited evidence of hypothalamus involvement in cardiovascular function, and of the hypothesized involvement of some of these genes in cardiovascular diseases, it is possible that the alcohol-mediated gene down-regulation in the hypothalamus that we observed is related to alcohol-induced cardiovascular disease. our hypothesis is based on the following considerations:

 <dig>  hypothalamus is a key cns site for cardiovascular regulation. hypothalamus is involved in many functions of the sympathetic nervous system, which tightly regulates cardiovascular activity  <cit> . therefore, changes in hypothalamic gene expression are likely to influence the cardiovascular system, including cardiac muscles. our study documented hypothalamic gene expression changes in the dcm pathway brought on by chronic alcohol consumption. given the key role that hypothalamus plays in sympathetic regulation of cardiovascular function, the concerted gene down regulation pattern that we observed in hypothalamus is likely to be involved in regulating cardiovascular function.

 <dig>  chronic alcohol intake can lead to cardiac muscle damage in human and animals, resulting in alcohol-induced cardiac muscle diseases, even heart failure. in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure patients, sympathetic system activation and cardiac β- <dig> adrenergic receptor down regulation are important characteristics of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure  <cit> . alcohol can activate the sympathetic nervous system, leading to down regulation of cardiac βar, gs, and ac in human alcoholics and rats consuming chronic alcohol  <cit> . this is consistent with our observation that in the hypothalamus of chronic alcohol-drinking mice, the spifs of the dcm pathway showed concerted down regulation. thus, chronic alcoholic intake leads to the dcm pathway spif down regulation in both the hypothalamus and the cardiovascular system. these results suggest that the spifs of the dcm pathway may play an important role in the development and progression of alcohol-mediated cardiovascular system injury and diseases .

 <dig>  cacna1d codes for the dihydropyridine receptor , which functions as a ca2+ channel to affect ca2+ influx across the cell membrane. in cacna1d partial knockout mice, heart dysfunction was reported  <cit> . in neurons, ca2+ channels mediate depolarization-induced ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane of excitable cells, thus regulating the key physiological processes  <cit> . there is no prior report of alcohol-induced cacna1d down regulation in the hypothalamus. in our study, the concerted down regulation of the spif genes in the hypothalamus includes cacna1d. it is possible that decreased synaptic transmission and neuropeptide secretion in the hypothalamus may influence cardiovascular functions.

 <dig>  epidemiological studies indicate that alcoholics who consume over 90 g of alcohol a day for over five years are at high risk for developing asymptomatic dcm; those who continue to drink alcohol for over 15 years may experience symptomatic dcm, leading to potential heart failure  <cit> . it is observed that with chronic alcohol consumption, metabolic changes occur within a few weeks  <cit> , but signs of depressed contractile function are detectable only after several months of alcohol consumption  <cit> .

in our study, the amount of alcohol consumed by mice is in the range of moderate levels, lasting about seven weeks. dcm pathway gene expression is already influenced in the hypothalamus under such conditions. this indicates two issues:  the drinking activities spanned the adolescence development, highlighting the danger of adolescent alcohol consumption even at moderate levels, and the potential harmful effect later in adulthood for cardiovascular function; and  gene activity changes in the hypothalamus may precede noticeable changes in body’s physiology and function, suggesting that these changes in dcm pathway genes may serve as early warning signs for alcohol’s harmful effect.

it should be pointed out that hypothalamus is a neuroanatomically heterogeneous brain structure, with various nuclei subserving diverse functions. samples in our study encompassed much of the hypothalamus, therefore potentially diluting the extent of local gene expression changes. future studies with more localized brain tissue collection will be helpful to delineate the roles of sub-hypothalamic regions in alcohol consumption and gene modulation. another point to note is that, although the observed differences in alcohol consumption were not statistically significant between the 5% and 10% groups of mice, there still might be subtle differences in related gene expression changes, but our study design did not allow for distinguishing expression changes that are related to the 5% vs. 10% alcohol groups. further studies with larger group sizes would offer improved opportunities to distinguish gene expression differences between different alcohol concentration groups. additional limitations of this study relate to the fact that only hypothalamic tissues of the brain were studied for gene expression changes; it would be beneficial in future studies to examine cardiac tissues for alcohol-affected genes observed in this study, as a way to validate the findings of the present study. another issue of note is that in our study, access to alcohol by mice was allowed to continue throughout the study, without any washout period. this study design was chosen to avoid any potential complication from alcohol withdrawal effect, both behaviorally and at the gene expression level, that would likely to occur if a no-drinking washout period were to be instituted. thus, because of the continued access to alcohol, acute alcohol actions may contribute to the results observed in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that chronic alcohol consumption during adolescence, even at moderate levels, may trigger gene expression changes in the cns that parallel those found in dilated cardiomyopathy . if such effects also take place in humans, our findings would serve as a warning against alcohol intake in youth, such as by teens and/or college students.
