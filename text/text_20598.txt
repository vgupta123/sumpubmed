BACKGROUND
the acquisition of horizontally transferred genes plays an important role in prokaryotic evolution  <cit> . the colonization of new ecological niches is often enabled by the acquisition of foreign genes, which can be transmitted by a large variety of mobile genetic elements  present in individual members of the microbial community. in terms of evolutionary success, it is thus interesting to understand how different mobile dna elements control their mobility and may adapt to their bacterial host  <cit> .

various classes of mge are known, the most well-studied of which are plasmids and bacteriophages  <cit> . plasmids, apart from certain exceptions such as the f-episome in escherichia coli, generally occur as extrachromosomal dna in the bacterial cell. an important aspect of their life-style, therefore, is to ensure replication, stability and maintenance in the host cell  <cit> , and a variety of control mechanisms have evolved hereto  <cit> . conjugative plasmids encode and orchestrate specific machineries to produce the transfer system dedicated to their own distribution   <cit> . by contrast, temperate bacteriophages insert into the host's chromosome, where they can remain silent and are co-replicated with the host's dna for many generations, or are eventually genetically defunctionalized. feedback regulatory systems silence phage behaviour in the temperate form, but can very rapidly induce the lytic phase , upon which thousands of phage particles are produced to commence a new infection cycle  <cit> .

more recently, a large new class of dna elements has been recognized that contributes importantly to bacterial genome evolution via horizontal gene transfer. most of these have been detected by comparative genome sequencing and have in general been named 'genomic islands'  to portray their foreign character within the host genome  <cit> . often, according to the functions encoded by the gei, they were classified as pathogenicity, symbiosis, metabolic, secretion or resistance islands  <cit> . recently we and others proposed that gei should be considered an overarching group of elements comprising both phage-like, integrative and conjugative elements , as well as conjugative transposons  <cit> . although gei are assumed to have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer, for most of them self-transfer has not been tested under experimental conditions. in some cases only gei excision from its chromosomal location has been observed, which is presumed to be the first step in horizontal transfer  <cit> . a self-transferable gei  can move its excised dna to a new host, where it can reintegrate with the help of an integrase enzyme at one or more specific insertion sites. gei transfer can be mediated by conjugation or transduction, either by the element itself or via mobilization by another mge. for some gei the conjugation machinery closely resembles that of known plasmid-types, such as that of the sxt element of vibrio cholerae  <cit>  or the icemlsymr7a element of mesorhizobium loti  <cit> . for others it is very distantly related to known plasmid conjugative systems, like for icehin <dig> of haemophilus influenzae, suggesting them to be evolutionary ancient elements  <cit> . the findings that many gei resemble phages by their integrase, but plasmids by their conjugative system  <cit> , suggests they are evolutionary hybrids, which may have global control mechanisms reminiscent of both phages and plasmids. to better understand the global control of such evolutionary hybrid elements and the consequences of the element's behavior for its bacterial host, it would be helpful to have detailed information on their transcriptional organization and regulation, which is presently still very fragmented. the sxt-element, for example, displays a key regulator  similar to the phage λ ci repressor that is autocleaved upon sos response, after which sxt transfer becomes strongly induced  <cit> . preliminary regulation studies were also performed on icehin <dig>  <cit>  and the pseudomonas aeruginosa elements pklc <dig> and pagi- <dig>  <cit> , but without attaining a global level.

our group has been studying a mobile gei in pseudomonas, ralstonia and burkholderia, called the clc element or iceclc  <cit> . iceclc has a size of  <dig> kilobase-pairs  and is integrated into the chromosome at the 3' 18-bp extremity of one or more trnaygly genes by the help of an unusually long p4-type integrase  <cit> . the first half of iceclc encodes two catabolic pathways involved in chlorocatechol  and 2-aminophenol  degradation  <cit>  . the second half contains a large set of syntenic genes that were defined as life-style 'core' for sixteen geis originating from different beta- and gammaproteobacteria  <cit> . among other things, this core has been proposed to encode a type iv conjugative secretion system distantly related to that of icehin <dig>  <cit> . in addition, this part of iceclc is assumed to encode the relaxosome complex needed for conjugation and was shown to bear a regulatory factor controlling excision and transfer  <cit> . iceclc is transferred from p. knackmussii b <dig> as donor to e.g., pseudomonas putida as recipient almost exclusively in stationary phase cultures with frequencies of self-transfer ≈ 10- <dig> per donor. self-transfer rates are highest in stationary phase cells grown with 3-chlorobenzoate and lower with fructose  <cit> . in line with this, expression of the promoter for the integrase is highest after growth on 3-chlorobenzoate, lower on fructose and essentially absent on glucose  <cit> . because of the conservation of the iceclc core region among different geis we were interested to study its transcriptional organization, as a further step towards the understanding of the life-style program of this class of mobile elements.

in order to resolve the global transcription network of iceclc in p. knackmussii b <dig>  we carried out a combined approach of northern hybridizations, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , semi-tiling array hybridization and rapid amplification of cdna ends . we detected fifteen transcripts, some of which were expressed to high levels in stationary phase cultures, but -- interestingly, not with all carbon sources.

RESULTS
transcriptional organization of the iceclc core region
in order to analyze the transcriptional organization of the core region of iceclc, we used a combination of conventional molecular techniques and semi-tiling micro-array analyses. the iceclc core spans the region between nucleotide  <dig>  until the left end of the element , and comprises the most conserved stretch among a number of closely related gei  <cit> . furthermore, it includes the integrase gene at the other side of iceclc .

on top of the rt-pcr analysis we mapped the length of detectable transcripts by northern hybridizations of rna isolated from p. knackmussii b <dig> cultures grown to stationary phase on 3-chlorobenzoate . arguably, northern hybridizations do not always produce clear-cut signals and often show multiple bands indicative for mrna degradation or processing, but for most of the transcript sizes and positions proposed by rt-pcr analysis supporting evidence was provided by northerns . even the breakpoints detected between orfs 62755- <dig> coincided with two detectable transcripts of around  <dig>  kb that could be positioned around the gap . the longest detected transcript seems to be formed by an estimated  <dig>  kb polycistronic mrna that would start upstream of orf <dig> and ending at orf <dig>  it is possible, as we will argue below, that this transcript is actually synthesized as a much longer one, but cleaved somewhere in the area of the gap identified by rt-pcr between orf <dig> and  <dig>  the downstream part would be formed by a  <dig> kb mrna that was detectable by probes for the orfs  <dig> and  <dig> . although a - <dig> promoter region was predicted upstream of orf <dig> by bioinformatic analysis, several others were predicted in this  <dig>  kb region as well . therefore, promoter prediction was not sufficiently accurate to support or refute the hypothesis for the  <dig>  and  <dig> kb regions being transcribed as a single polycistronic mrna.

micro-array analysis assisted transcript mapping
to complement the rt-pcr and northern analyses, we hybridized cy3-labeled cdna synthesized from total rna isolated from p. knackmussii b <dig> cultures during exponential growth on 3-chlorobenzoate and during the following stationary phase, to custom-designed semi-tiling microarrays for iceclc. the semi-tiling array contained a 50-mer probe at approximately every  <dig> bases over the whole length of iceclc and for both strands, each in sixfold replicate on the array. we expected that a semi-tiling array format would permit us to map the position of iceclc transcripts in a complementary way to the conventional molecular analysis, which would help to reinforce the conclusions drawn on the transcriptional organization of the iceclc core. figure  <dig> shows an overlay of the core gene organization and rt-pcr plus northern derived transcriptional organization with the average micro-array hybridization signals per probe on the plus- and the minus-strand of the iceclc core region, whilst table  <dig> summarizes the transcript details across all three methods. very strikingly, most of the predicted transcripts follow a clear 5'-3' decrease in signal intensity, the slopes of which were different for each transcript region . we think the 5'-3' decrease in intensity may partially be caused by the fact that more transcripts are formed near the transcription start, which perhaps are incompletely finished, or by preferential 3'-end degradation. this effect has been noted by others using tiling approaches for transcript determination  <cit> . different slopes may be the result of varying mrna stability and processing speed.

b) in kilobase observed; within brackets, size calculated from sequence.

e) log2-average ratio of hybridization intensities over all microarray probes covering the presumed transcript during stationary phase versus exponential phase on 3-chlorobenzoate.

semi-tiling array hybridizations confirmed most of the proposed transcripts, including breakpoints, where the slope of the decrease in hybridization intensity as a function of probe position changed abruptly . an exception here was the rt-pcr detected breakpoint in between orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  where micro-array hybridizations did not show any aberrant change in slope of signal decrease. from this, therefore, we conclude that the long transcripts of  <dig>  and  <dig> kb mentioned above actually originate from one  <dig>  kb-long polycistronic mrna starting at orf <dig> and ending downstream of orf <dig>  this transcript would then be rapidly processed in the indicated breakpoint area, although this should be confirmed by alternative techniques.

for one other region the pattern of 5'-3' decreasing slope did not match the hypothesis of a single transcript predicted from rt-pcr and northern. this occurred in the area around  <dig>  to  <dig>  where rt-pcr had predicted a continuing transcript covering a four-gene cluster including orf <dig>   <cit> , orf <dig> , inrr   <cit>  and orf <dig> . indeed, northerns had already suggested two transcripts here, not completely covering the whole region , and also tiling array hybridizations showed two or even three differently 'sloped' hybridization patterns. therefore, it might be that there is read-through from orf <dig> into orf <dig>  producing the detected rt-pcr connection, but an additional promoter upstream of orf <dig> does not seem unlikely .

whereas most of the genes in the iceclc core region are organized on the minus strand , four genes are oriented on the plus strand. in general, hybridization signal intensities on micro-array for plus strand probes were lower than for the minus strand , but the signals coming from the small cluster of three genes at around  <dig>  and the single orf <dig> can be discerned on micro-array as being significantly above local background.

carbon substrate dependent expression of iceclc core genes
micro-array hybridizations clearly demonstrated that most of the core genes on the minus strand are upregulated in stationary phase conditions , with -- fold changes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . rnas from a larger number of different growth conditions were hybridized in dot-blot format using digoxigenin-labeled probes representative for all proposed transcripts . this showed that the expression of the highly abundant core transcripts represented by orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  actually started in the first twelve hours after reaching stationary phase and then increased continuously further up to  <dig> h. in contrast, transcription from the three plus strand orfs 52324- <dig> seemed to 'peak' in very early stationary phase, but then successively decreased . hybridizing blotted rnas from p. knackmussii b <dig> grown to stationary phase on different carbon substrates showed, interestingly, that the three transcripts 68241- <dig> , 83350- <dig> , and 85934- <dig>  were highly induced only in stationary phase cells that had been cultured with 3-chlorobenzoate or fructose, but not at all with succinate or glucose . highest induction of the iceclc core region genes in stationary phase cells grown with 3-chlorobenzoate is in agreement with previous experiments that showed the highest proportion of excised iceclc and highest iceclc transfer rates in cells cultured on 3-chlorobenzoate to stationary phase  <cit> .

another gene that produced relatively high signals in dot-blot hybridizations was orf <dig>  which urged us to analyze its expression more conspicuously by rt-pcr. contrary to rna isolated in stationary phase from 3-chlorobenzoate or fructose-grown cultures, consistently no rt-pcr product was obtained for the intergenic region between orf <dig> and orf <dig> on rna from cells that had been cultivated with glucose . rna isolated from all three substrate conditions did produce a smaller rt-pcr fragment directly upstream of orf <dig> , suggesting that an additional promoter exists that produces a transcript covering orf <dig> only. in fact, northern hybridizations with a probe for orf <dig> produced an additional band of  <dig>  kb length . the promoter located in front of orf <dig> might thus be specifically repressed after growth on glucose , or specifically activated after growth on 3-chlorobenzoate and fructose.

promoter analysis
results from 5'-race were not as conclusive as expected. although various amplicons were produced from cdna ends, only few matched the start region for transcripts detected by rt-pcr, northern and micro-array. in contrast, the start site for the transcript covering inrr could be mapped in the region upstream of orf <dig> to a thymine located  <dig> nt upstream of the orf <dig> start codon. interestingly, the corresponding - <dig> box  and - <dig>  are close to the proposed consensus sequence of σs and not σ <dig>  suggesting it is controlled by rpos  <cit> . this could explain a higher abundance of this transcript during stationary compared to exponential phase as seen on micro-array . 5'-race also produced a clear transcription start upstream of orf <dig> , which is in agreement to the other data and suggests a promoter being present at positions  <dig>  to  <dig>   and  <dig>  to  <dig>  . on the contrary, no 5'race product but a very weak product was obtained by primer extension in the region upstream of orf <dig>  which located at ~ <dig> bp upstream of the start codon , even though this transcript was among the most abundant ones of the iceclc core region . in a few other cases, bioinformatic searches identified promoter signatures which locate in regions where transcripts were deemed to start , but their nature remains to be experimentally verified.

discussion
by using a combination of semi-tiling micro-array hybridization and conventional techniques for transcription analysis, we obtained a highly detailed picture on the transcriptional organization of the iceclc core region. to our knowledge, this is one of the first examples of tiling micro-array in combination with rt-pcr and northern hybridizations to study transcriptional organization of mobile dna elements, the only other one currently being a study on the plasmid pcar <dig> of p. resinovorans  <cit> . we conclude from our results that such a combined approach can give excellent complementary data and retrieve details that either one of the typical transcription approaches alone cannot obtain. except for a few locations, the results from all approaches on iceclc's transcriptome were mostly in agreement with each other, or critically supported omissions in each of them individually. fourteen transcripts were detected by rt-pcr and northern; one more was inferred from micro-array hybridization . some transcripts seem clearly part of one larger but rapidly cleaved polycistronic mrna , whereas in one case  three transcripts were consistently detected but gene organization suggests close linkage.

the importance of the iceclc core gene region lays in its proposed control of the element's behavior: excision, self-transfer, maintenance and reintegration. even though still only few iceclc core genes have clear identifiable homology to known proteins , the region as a whole is largely conserved in a large collection of other gei, underscoring its functional importance for life-style  <cit> . the  <dig> or  <dig> transcripts in the iceclc core region, including a long  <dig>  kb transcript , is in the order of transcript numbers typically found for self-transfer and maintenance functions of conjugative plasmids . four of the core transcripts  might code for a type iv secretion system  similar to that of icehin <dig> from h. influenza   <cit> . furthermore, the orf <dig> product has weak homology to a relaxase and orf <dig> has a dna topoisomerase domain, suggesting possible implication in a relaxosome complex involving the excised circular iceclc form . a comparison with the icehin <dig> transcriptional organization in this area shows a number of differences, which are likely due to extensive gene arrangements during evolutionary divergence between the two elements . for example, the long icehin <dig> transcript covering the mating pair complex , is interrupted on iceclc by the reversely oriented orf <dig>  the transcript containing orf <dig>  is not the start, but part of a much longer transcript starting at orf <dig> on iceclc. second difference between iceclc and icehin <dig> relates to the large inversion of the genes tfc <dig> to tfc <dig> . icehin <dig> data suggested two transcripts in this region, with one being formed by the presumed regulatory gene tfc <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, on iceclc orf <dig>  is apparently the second gene of a six-gene transcript.

the relative abundance of transcripts in the region orf <dig> to orf <dig> of iceclc was up to 64-fold  different between stationary and exponential phase . if the postulate is correct that these genes would encode part of the type iv secretion system necessary for iceclc transfer , their induction would be much more pronounced than what is usual for plasmid conjugative systems. in most cases, the mpf genes are either weakly expressed or tightly regulated and inducible  <cit> , the reason presumably being that expression of the conjugative apparatus is energy costly and could favor male-type specific phage infection. tight control of the transfer genes of plasmids is often achieved by autoregulatory loops, such as the incp- <dig> pww <dig> plasmid traa and mpfr genes that control the relaxosome complex and mpf operons, respectively  <cit> . also, the presumed genes involved in conjugative transfer of the incp- <dig> plasmid pcar <dig> in pseudomonas putida and p. resinovorans are expressed at low and similar transcriptional level  during growth on succinate or carbazole  <cit> . induction of the putative conjugative system of iceclc would thus be more similar to the type of induction found in the sxt element  <cit> , which is a hybrid between phage-lambda type control and plasmid-like conjugation. however, none of the iceclc functions has any significant sequence similarity to the setr -- setc -- setd regulators of sxt, nor to the ci repressor from λ. the type of program that seems to be followed by iceclc  is indeed reminiscent of a phage program  <cit> , but we conclude that control layers are different from phage type. the finding that basically eight of fifteen identified transcripts in the iceclc core region are upregulated during stationary phase, suggests a coordinated global control mechanism, which is perhaps assisted by the stationary phase sigma factor rpos. indeed, some evidence for rpos control was obtained from sequence motifs in the inrr promoter. it is interesting to speculate as to what would be the ecological or physiological advantage for iceclc to become active during stationary phase. one hypothesis is that of the 'sinking ship': the element senses that its host survival  is endangered and tries to escape to a more favorable host cell . even more intriguing is perhaps the carbon substrate-specific upregulation of iceclc activity, which is highest after growth on 3-chlorobenzoate, less with fructose and very low with glucose or succinate as carbon sources. upregulation of the iceclc core region expression in stationary phase cells grown with 3-chlorobenzoate is in agreement with previous results showing increased activity of the integrase promoter  <cit> , increased proportion of iceclc excised dna and increased iceclc transfer rates  <cit> . since it is assumed that during stationary phase cells have depleted their carbon source, the carbon source can no longer be directly be responsible for the activation, but somehow must have generated a 'memory' effect which triggers iceclc response. in this light, the repression seen for transcription read-through from orf <dig> with glucose and succinate might point to a crc-type regulation of catabolite repression in pseudomonas  <cit> , although for the time being no specific crc binding motifs were detected in the iceclc core region.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified fifteen transcripts covering the presumed core region for behavioral functions of iceclc. eight of those are concertedly upregulated during stationary phase, but only after previous growth of the cells on 3-chlorobenzoate or fructose, which explains previous results that have seen highest iceclc transfer rates under such conditions  <cit> . the number and lengths of iceclc transcripts is similar to that found for typical conjugative plasmid systems, yet the mode of global transcription control is more reminiscent for phage-type control. we thus conclude that the hybrid transcriptional control mode comprising both conjugative plasmid and phage strategies has been selected in mobile elements of the iceclc group.
