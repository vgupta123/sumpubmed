BACKGROUND
gray leaf spot  is a destructive fungal disease and poses a serious threat to maize production worldwide. the yield loss caused by gls varies with different environmental conditions and cultivars. for instance, epidemic gls could result in >50% yield loss in the united states  <cit> , 20–50% in brazilian central region  <cit> , and  <dig> to 60% in south africa  <cit> .

both cercospora zeae-maydis  and cercospora zeina  are considered to be the casual pathogens to gls  <cit> . cercospora spores overwinter on corn debris left in the field, until conidia begin to develop in warm temperature and high humidity in the next growing season  <cit> . after initial pathogen infection, gls lesions appear first on the bottom leaves. in the early stages, it is hard to distinguish gls symptoms from those of other foliar diseases, such as northern corn leaf blight and southern corn leaf blight. some mature gls lesions, however, have unique features and are characterized by their distinct rectangular shapes parallel to the veins  <cit> .

compared with regular methods for disease control , cultivation of gls-resistant hybrids is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to reduce yield loss due to gray leaf spot  <cit> . gls resistance is a canonical quantitatively-inherited trait  <cit> . moreover, general combining ability is predominant in gls resistance, implying that additive genetic effects are more important than non-additive effects for resistance development  <cit> . thus, qtl identification would accelerate the breeding of resistant hybrids. for example, the simple sequence repeat  markers linked to qtls in bins  <dig>  and  <dig>  were used to select gls-resistant maize  <cit> . so far, a quite number of qtls associated with gls resistance have been reported using various parental lines and mapping groups  <cit> . out of  <dig> resistance qtls, seven consensus qtls were found on chromosome bins  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   <cit> . qtls for gls resistance were reported to show stable genetic contributions to gls resistance in different environments  <cit> . some resistance qtls were localized in the region associated with multiple-disease resistance, suggesting an intriguing broad-spectrum resistance  <cit> . in our previous study, we used the gls-resistant line y <dig> and the gls-susceptible line q <dig> to develop mapping populations for qtl analysis. one of the major qtls in bin  <dig> – <dig> is restricted to an ~ <dig> -mb region. another major qtl, qrgls <dig> in bin  <dig> – <dig>  is located within an ~110-mb region spanning the whole centromere of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

using a recombinant-derived progeny testing strategy, we ultimately mapped qrgls <dig> to a ~1-mb interval on chromosome  <dig>  which was close to the heterochromatin portion around the centromere. the mapped qrgls <dig> region shows syteny with two distant segments on chr. <dig> in maize as well as one segment on chr. <dig> in rice. our results provide useful information for qrgls <dig> cloning, and the markers developed around qrgls <dig> can be readily used for breeding gls-resistant maize.

methods
plant materials
a highly gls-resistant inbred line, y <dig>  was developed from the tropical population suwan <dig> and used as a donor parent. the highly gls-susceptible line q <dig> was used as a recurrent receptor parent . the two parental lines were crossed to produce the f <dig> hybrid, which was continuously selfed to generate f <dig>  f2: <dig>  and f3: <dig> populations. the f <dig> and f <dig> populations were planted in kunming . the 161 f2: <dig> families derived from 161 f <dig> individuals were evaluated for gls resistance in baoshan and dehong . in the initial qtl mapping, the mean disease scale of each f2: <dig> family was used to describe the disease state of the parental f <dig> individual  <cit> . in the winter nursery of 2010/ <dig>  the f3: <dig> families was planted in jinghong  to screen for recombinants using flanking markers bnlg <dig> and umc <dig>  then, recombinants were identified and backcrossed to q <dig> to produce bc1f <dig> progeny, which were planted in baoshan to evaluate gls disease severity. we planted the bc1f <dig> progeny of each f3: <dig> recombinant into one plot and all plots were randomly distributed. every plot has eight rows,  <dig>  m in length and  <dig>  m in width each row. each row has  <dig> holes. totally,  <dig> seeds were sowed per plot. because of the severity of gls in the recurrent parent q <dig>  it was impossible to backcross bc1f <dig> individuals to q <dig>  therefore, we selfed each bc1f <dig> individual as well as the bc2f <dig> and bc3f <dig> populations in baoshan. in 2011/ <dig>  we planted bc1f4: <dig> families in the winter nursery in jinghong to screen for more recombinants. the resultant recombinants were then backcrossed to q <dig> to develop bc2f <dig> progeny. the bc2f <dig> population was grown in boshan to investigate its gls resistance. the bc2f <dig> progeny of each bc1f4: <dig> recombinants were planted in one plot with ten rows. there are  <dig> holes each row. totally,  <dig> seeds were sowed per plot. in 2012/ <dig>  the bc2f5: <dig> families were grown in sanya  to obtain recombinants. in  <dig>  bc3f <dig> plants derived from bc2f5: <dig> recombinants were grown in boshan for fine-mapping of qrgls <dig>  we arranged  <dig> rows per plot for each bc3f <dig> progeny. totally,  <dig> seeds were sowed per plot. the development of the mapping populations and the screening of recombinants are depicted in additional file 1: figure s <dig> figure  <dig>

disease scoring in the field
the fine-mapping populations were planted in baoshan and infected naturally with causal fungus cercospora zeina   <cit> . we scored gls symptoms three times at intervals of 1 week, beginning 2 weeks after pollination. the number and size of disease spots on the leaves of the entire plant were used to evaluate gls severity. disease severity was rated using the following scale:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   <cit> .

development of high-density markers in the qrgls <dig> region
according to the b <dig> reference genome v <dig>  assembly  , the physical distance of the confidence interval for qrgls <dig> is ~110-mb and covers the whole centromere of chromosome  <dig>  ssr and insertions or deletions  polymorphism  markers located in the qrgls <dig> region were retrieved from the maize genetics and genomics database . because of the low density of these existing markers, we then developed new markers within the qtl region. we downloaded the sequences of the qrgls <dig> region from b <dig> refgen_v <dig>  and mined possible ssr sequences using ssrhunter <dig>  software  <cit> . single-copy ssr sequences were obtained after blastn comparison with the maize high-throughput genome sequence  database, and ssr markers were developed using primer <dig>  software  <cit> . for primer design, we searched for single-copy sequences in the qrgls <dig> region based on the b <dig> genome, and we then amplified those sequences from the genomes of the two parents, y <dig> and q <dig>  pcr products were separately cloned into the pgem-t vector for sequencing. to confirm that the correct sequences were obtained, we projected the sequenced amplicons on the b <dig> genome using contigexpress project software . sequence alignment of the two parents revealed indels that were then developed into idp markers. single-nucleotide polymorphisms  were used to develop snp markers. finally, to ensure that markers were located in the qrgls <dig> region, we ran a blast analysis on the gramene website . for ssr and idp markers, pcr products were analyzed electrophoretically on a 2% agarose gel or 6% polyacrylamide gel. for snp markers, pcr products were cloned into a pgem-t vector and sequenced to determine sequence variation.

estimation of the genetic effect of qrgls2
sequential fine-mapping of qrgls <dig> was carried out using recombinants and their progeny. the progeny derived from a given recombinant were divided into two genotypes based on their sequences at the qrgls <dig> region: the heterozygous q11/y <dig> genotype and the homozygous q11/q <dig> genotype. the disease scales  <dig> and  <dig> were classified as resistant, scales  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as susceptible. the resistance percentage for each genotype was an estimate of the proportion of resistant plants within the population. the relative difference in the resistance percentage between two genotypes represents the genetic contribution of the introgression region to gls disease resistance.

a statistical model for declaration of qrgls2
a linear regression model yi 
= α + βxi 
+ εi was used to test whether a significant association exists between the disease scales and the genotypes in the recombinant-derived progeny. in the backcross population, variable xi represents the genotype of the donor segment, xi =  <dig>  when the marker genotype is aa , or xi =  <dig>  when the marker genotype is aa . yi represents the phenotypic value for the ith individual, α is an intercept, β is the regression coefficient for yi on xi, and εi is random error  <cit> .

the significance of the regression coefficient was evaluated using the t-test. a p-value of ≤ <dig>  indicated the presence of a significant association, and the donor segment covered the qrgls <dig> locus. in contrast, a p-value of > <dig>  revealed no significant correlation, and the donor did not contain the qrgls <dig> locus. the statistical analysis was run with r  <dig> . <dig> software .

RESULTS
development of high-density markers in the qrgls <dig> region
in the initial qtl mapping, qrgls <dig> was mapped to a large chromosomal region because of the small mapping population and low-density markers. high-resolution mapping of qrgls <dig> is essential for the isolation of genes involved in gls resistance. we thus mined ssrs in the qrgls <dig> region based on the b <dig> reference genome and identified  <dig> single/low-copy ssrs. based on their flanking regions, we designed  <dig> primer pairs to amplify both parental lines y <dig> and q <dig>  polymorphic pcr products were observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> primer pairs. of these  <dig> ssr markers, only  <dig> were selected to saturate the qrgls <dig> region , as the other  <dig> ssr markers were tightly linked to these  <dig> markers. to develop idp and snp markers, we searched b <dig> reference genome and selected  <dig> single/low-copy segments in the qrgls <dig> region to design primers. these primers were used to amplify the two parental genome dna and the amplicons were sequenced. based on sequence variations between y <dig> and q <dig>  we developed  <dig> idp markers and one snp marker. finally, in the light of amplification efficiency and physical location,  <dig> of the  <dig> idp markers and one snp marker were used to saturate the candidate interval .table  <dig>

fine-mapping of qrgls2
qrgls <dig> was mapped to an interval of ~110-mb, flanked by the markers umc <dig> and umc <dig>  in the initial qtl mapping  <cit> . it explained  <dig> – <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation in the mapping population  <cit> . we conducted a one-way analysis of variance  in the f2: <dig> families using the qrgls2-tagged marker g <dig> . the homozygous y32/y <dig> or heterozygous q11/y <dig> genotype showed a lower disease scale than the homozygous q11/q <dig> genotype, indicating the presence of qrgls <dig> in the mapped region . therefore, we conducted sequential fine-mapping of qrgls <dig> from  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

a total of  <dig> recombinants screened from the  <dig>  progeny of 52 f3: <dig> families were backcrossed to q <dig> to generate  <dig> corresponding bc1f <dig> progeny. the sizes of their donor regions were estimated by genotyping at nine markers, including four newly developed markers  . in the summer of  <dig>   <dig>  bc1f <dig> individuals were planted . all bc1f <dig> plants were scored for gls disease severity and genotyped at the introgression region. the presence of a significant correlation  between genotypes and disease scales indicated that the introgression segment covered the qrgls <dig> locus.figure  <dig>

 recombinants were classified into  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> types, respectively. the genomic architecture for each type is depicted as black, white, and gray rectangles, representing heterozygous q11/y <dig>  homozygous q11/q <dig>  and mixed regions , respectively. table on the right: increased resistance percentage is defined as the difference in resistance percentage between genotypes q11/y <dig> and q11/q <dig> that resulted from the donor region of y32; the total number of plants refers to all progeny of a given recombinant type; list of markers used to detect the presence/absence of the donor region; a p-value of ≤ <dig>  indicates the regression coefficient between genotype and disease scale is significant within the progeny derived from a given recombinant type. this suggests the presence of qrgls <dig> on the donor region, and the parental recombinant was deduced to be gls resistant . a p-value of > <dig>  indicates that no significant correlation between genotype and disease scale is present, suggesting that qrgls <dig> is absent from the donor region of the parental recombinant, which is therefore marked as gls susceptible . analysis of both the deduced phenotype and the donor region for all recombinants enabled us to narrow qrgls <dig> from an ~110-mb to an ~1-mb region, flanked by the markers g <dig> and dd <dig> 



for a given f3:4-derived bc1f <dig> progeny, there are two genotypes, q11/q <dig> and q11/y <dig>  at the introgression segment. the recombinants were considered to have the same genotype if they shared the same introgression segment. thus, the 22 f3: <dig> recombinants were classified into seven types . types i and ii carried the introgression segments downstream of the umc <dig> and bnlg <dig> markers, respectively, whereas type vii carried the introgression segments upstream of b <dig>  no significant correlation between genotype and disease scale was detected in the bc1f <dig> progeny for each of these three types , indicating that qrgls <dig> was absent in their introgression segments. in contrast, types iii and iv carried the introgression segments downstream of b <dig> and umc <dig>  respectively, and types v and vi had the introgression segments upstream of umc <dig> and umc <dig>  respectively. the regression coefficients between genotype and disease scale were significant  for types iii, iv, v, and vi, implying the presence of the resistance qtl, qrgls <dig>  in their introgression segments. thus the qrgls <dig> region could be narrowed to an interval between the markers b <dig> and xl <dig>  with a physical distance of ~62-mb according to b <dig> refgen_v <dig> 

similar analysis was conducted in the bc1f5-derived  <dig>  bc2f <dig> progeny in  <dig>  sixteen markers were used to genotype  <dig> bc1f <dig> recombinants and to group them into  <dig> types. of these,  <dig>  were located between b <dig> and xl <dig> and two  were located downstream of xl <dig>  within the mapped qrgls <dig> region, types i–ix had downstream introgression segments that did not carry the resistance qtl, qrgls <dig> . type ix had the longest introgression segments of these, indicating that qrgls <dig> was not present downstream of g <dig>  types x to xviii carried the introgression segments that harbored the resistance qtl, qrgls <dig> . type xviii carried the introgression segment upstream of idp <dig>  suggesting the presence of qrgls <dig> in the introgression segment upstream of idp <dig>  the findings from types ix and xviii thus restrict the right border of qrgls <dig> to idp <dig>  type x had the closest crossing-over point to the left of the qrgls <dig> locus, thus restricting the left border of qrgls <dig> to g <dig>  in summary, these three types had the closest recombination breakpoints to qrgls <dig> and restricted qrgls <dig> to an interval of ~ <dig> -mb between markers g <dig> and idp <dig> .

in  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  bc3f <dig> plants derived from  <dig> bc2f <dig> recombinants were planted. moreover, a total of  <dig> markers, ten  within the qrgls <dig> region and four  located upstream of g <dig>  were used to genotype  <dig> bc2f <dig> recombinants and to group them into  <dig> types. within the newly mapped qrgls <dig> region, types i to v and types xv to xvii did not have qrgls <dig> in their introgression segments , suggesting qrgls <dig> was present between the left marker g <dig> and the right marker dd <dig>  types vi to xiv had the resistance qtl qrgls <dig> in their introgression segments  and thus restricted qrgls <dig> to the g <dig> and g <dig> interval. these types, with and without qrgls <dig>  unanimously mapped qrgls <dig> into the g346/dd <dig> interval with the physical distance of ~1-mb according to the b <dig> refgen_v <dig> .

genetic contribution of qrgls <dig> to gls resistance
the genetic effect of qrgls <dig> was estimated in f2: <dig>  bc1f <dig>  bc2f <dig>  and bc3f <dig> populations, respectively. as expected, plants carrying the qrgls <dig> regions showed higher gls resistance than those without qrgls <dig>  in f2: <dig> families, the percentages of resistant individuals were estimated to be  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for q11/q <dig>  q11/y <dig>  and y32/y <dig> genotypes, respectively . the resistance percentage in the bc1f <dig> population in  <dig> was  <dig> % in plants with qrgls <dig> versus  <dig> % in plants without qrgls <dig> . similarly, phenotyping of the bc2f <dig> population in  <dig> suggested consistent resistance improvement associated with qrgls <dig> . finally, in the bc3f <dig> population, individuals carrying the qtl regions showed a resistance percentage of  <dig> %, whereas individuals lacking the qtl segments only showed  <dig> % disease resistance . these results, which were derived from multiple populations over many years, indicated qrgls <dig> enhances gls resistance by  <dig>  to  <dig> % and that this genetic effect is passed on to subsequent generations.figure  <dig>

qrgls <dig> is adjacent to the centromere of chromosome  <dig>  and the whole region exhibits very low gene density and recombination frequencies as compared with the average across the whole genome  <cit> . in eukaryotes, genes often show uneven distribution along the chromosomes, and they organize in clusters with different gene densities and sizes  <cit> . this characteristic is also seen in the qrgls <dig> region. the  <dig> predicted genes are unequally scattered throughout the mapping region. ten genes are clustered on the left end, three genes are located at the right end, and only two genes are located in the middle portion, which occupies ~800-kb and ranges from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,000 bp based on the b <dig> refgen_v <dig> . we analyzed the sequence of this 800-kb gene-desert region using the repeatmasker  and found that  <dig> % of the sequence consists of transposable elements . this percentage is higher than that across the whole maize genome   <cit> .figure  <dig>

region and its syntenic blocks in maize and rice. maize chromosome  <dig> has two syntenic blocks: zm chr. 4- <dig> ranges from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,826 bp , and zm chr. 4- <dig> ranges from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,290 bp . in rice, the syntenic block os chr. <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,346 bp . the syntenic blocks in maize are depicted as green zones; syntenic blocks between maize and rice are depicted as pink zones. the arrows indicate genes and their orientations; the dotted lines indicate regions without genes. each pair of reversely syntenic genes with identical sequence is tinted with the same color. the  <dig> predicted genes in the qrgls <dig> region in chromosome  <dig> are grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm5g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , ac <dig> _fg <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , and grmzm2g <dig> . zm: zea mays; os: oryza sativa; chr.: chromosome.



we then searched for duplicated genomic fragments using the plant genome duplication database  and found some genes in the qrgls <dig> interval that share high synteny with rice genes located on chromosome  <dig> . moreover, we detected two syntenic blocks in maize that are present separately on the short and long arms of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the one  present on the long arm is a part of the large duplicated region between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which is assumed to originate from whole-genome duplication followed by genome rearrangement from tetraploid to diploid  <cit> . the gene content and order within this syntenic block are well conserved, and only a few sequence variations were observed between the coding regions of homologous genes . intriguingly, the other syntenic block , which is located on the short arm, shows perfect reverse collinearity, with the coding sequences of six genes being identical in reverse order in two collinear blocks . this inverted synteny may derive from a recent genomic duplication and rearrangement, which took place long after the ancient whole-genome duplication.

discussion
gls resistance is a quantitatively inherited trait and thus hinders breeding of resistant maize varieties  <cit> . host resistance is the most cost-effective and efficient way to control gls disease  <cit> . therefore, discovery of a resistance qtl and introgression into elite inbred lines via marker-assisted selection  would greatly increase gls resistance  <cit> . the qrgls <dig> locus overlaps with previously reported qtls  <cit> , implying the qrgls <dig> region may exist in other mapping populations. moreover, we showed that the qrgls <dig> locus is heritable and could stably enhance resistance percentages by >20% across multiple generations. these findings suggest that qrgls <dig> could be used to improve maize resistance to gls, and high-density markers around the qrgls <dig> region will be useful for mas.

because of the low density of publicly available markers around qrgls <dig>  we retrieved single/low-copy sequences to develop either ssr or idp or snp markers to saturate the qrgls <dig> region. this strategy, however, turned out to be inefficient. only a small fraction of the designed primers could be converted into markers. in the future, using genome sequences from diverse maize inbred lines, we can compare in silico the mined single/low-copy sequences, for instance between b <dig> and mo <dig>  and select those with sequence variations.

sequential recombinant-derived progeny testing is a powerful method for fine-mapping of resistance qtls  <cit> . this strategy can be modified to accommodate different situations. in the current study, we evaluated gls resistance during the growing season in baoshan in advanced backcross populations. however, it was impossible for us to produce backcross populations in baoshan because of severe infections of the recurrent parent line q <dig>  therefore, all individuals were selfed, and the resulting self-progeny of newly identified recombinants were grown in winter nurseries  where no gls was prevalent. heterozygous individuals were then selected and backcrossed to q <dig>  if the recombinant-derived progeny segregated at the qrgls <dig> region, we were able to estimate the relative difference of gls resistance between two genotypes and to fine-map the qrgls <dig> locus. in addition, the advanced backcross progeny shared similar genetic backgrounds with very low background noise  <cit> . this is very helpful for accurately estimating the genetic contribution of the donor region of a given recombinant to gls resistance. during screening of recombinants, we were aware that the recombination frequency seems to increase in the qrgls <dig> region as backcrossing advanced. the genetic distance per mb was estimated to be  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig>  and  <dig> e- <dig> in f3: <dig>  bc1f4: <dig> and bc2f5: <dig> populations, respectively. we hope to obtain some key recombinants in the qrgls <dig> locus when screening more advanced populations. the key recombinants in or around the qrgls <dig> locus is critical to narrow a qtl to a qtg , or even to a qtn  for qrgls <dig> 

there are  <dig> functional genes in qrgls <dig> region according to the 5b. <dig> annotation of the maize b <dig> genome v <dig>  we also evaluated b <dig> for its resistance to gls in boshan and found b <dig> is highly susceptible to gls. thus, none of the  <dig> genes is likely to be the candidate for qrgls <dig>  the resistance gene in the y <dig> may be a resistance allele to one of the  <dig> predicted genes or totally a new gene that is absent in b <dig>  fortunately, we have constructed the y <dig> bacterial artificial chromosome  library and obtained the positive bac clones covering the qrgls <dig> region. sequence analysis of the qrgls <dig> region of y <dig> could reveal all candidate genes, including the resistance gene underlying qrgls <dig> 

the ratio of genetic to physical distance in the mapped qrgls <dig> region is only ~ <dig>  cm/mb, which is much lower than the average ratio of  <dig>  cm/mb across the entire maize genome  <cit> . chromosomal recombination occurs more frequently at chromosomal ends as compared with centromere regions in maize  <cit> . additionally, gene density is much higher at chromosomal ends than in the centromere regions  <cit> . the qrgls <dig> region is located in the centromere region of chromosome  <dig> and is characterized by both low gene density  and a low recombination frequency. furthermore, the  <dig> predicted genes are unequally distributed in the mapped region. these findings render it very difficult to further screen the key recombinants for fine-mapping, although we continue to expand the mapping population. the same situation was reported for the cloning of ghd <dig>  which is involved in the regulation of the heading date in rice  <cit> . the candidate gene was mapped to the final  <dig> -cm interval in the centromere region of chromosome  <dig>  corresponding to the physical distance of  <dig>  kb. gene annotation identified the candidate gene for ghd <dig>  which was finally cloned via functional complementation  <cit> . it seems that several approaches are required to clone the genes in the centromeric region. apart from continued fine-mapping, we will also use transcriptome sequencing and association mapping to confirm the candidate gene for qrgls <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the development and cultivation of resistant maize hybrids are the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective ways to improve maize resistance to gls. we identified a major qtl, qrgls <dig>  for gls resistance and narrowed its location from an initial ~110-mb to a ~1-mb region. qrgls <dig> mainly acted in an additive manner and showed very stable genetic effects across multiple generations. the qrgls <dig> region is very close to the centromere of chromosome  <dig> and is characterized by low and unequal gene density. a total of  <dig> genes were predicted in the final mapped interval, according to the 5b. <dig> annotation of the maize b <dig> genome v <dig>  our findings provide a solid base for map-based cloning of the gls resistance gene underlying qrgls <dig> in maize. the high-density markers developed around qrgls <dig> will be useful in mas for gls-resistant breeding.
