BACKGROUND
afferent projections from skin to primary somatosensory cortex  are well known to form a fine map of the body surface in si. in this map, a skin locus provides afferent input to an extensive cortical region in si  <cit> . in particular, the direct connectivity between somatosensory thalamus and si cortex is now recognized to be much more spatially distributed than previously believed . the intrinsic si excitatory connections link not only neighboring but also widely separated regions of somatosensory cortex  <cit> . these connections ensure that many members of widely distributed neuronal populations interact extensively within milliseconds after the onset of stimulus-evoked thalamocortical drive. thus it is not surprising to find that the processing of even a very local skin stimulus is associated with si activation over several sq. millimeters of cortical area, as revealed, for example, with optical imaging techniques  <cit> .

such spatially extensive cortical regions are not functionally homogeneous. for example, using optical intrinsic signal  imaging in near-infrared  range, we find that in squirrel monkeys a small-diameter stimulus probe oscillating on the skin at  <dig> hz activates more than  <dig> mm <dig> of cortical territory in area 3b of si  <cit> . such a territory can contain as many as  <dig> place-defined cortical columns  organized into 4– <dig> alternating rapidly- and slowly-adapting submodality bands  <cit> . chen et al.  <cit>  reported that the relative magnitudes of optical response in local,  <dig> – <dig>  mm wide, si regions changes when the frequency of the stimulating probe is changed from simple taps to  <dig> hz to  <dig> hz . and on even finer spatial scale si might be organized in ~ <dig> μm-diameter functionally distinct minicolumns  <cit> .

together these considerations suggest that the spatial pattern of activity evoked in si by even the smallest stimuli might be structurally more complex than a typically envisioned basic bell-shaped pattern. a closer inspection of such patterns might reveal certain spatial formations within them with significant functional implications. recently, we investigated the response of si cortex to varying amplitudes of flutter stimulation. regardless of the amplitude of stimulation , we found that the spatial extent of the response of si cortex remained the same  <cit> . instead, the actuated cortical region exhibits increases in its magnitude of neuronal response proportional to the intensity of stimulation  <cit> . one feature of particular interest in our study was that the activity patterns evoked within these spatially delineated regions, when viewed at high resolution, appeared to develop in an orderly manner dependent on stimulus amplitude. the purpose of this study was to determine if those patterns are indeed systematic, and if so, to characterize them quantitatively.

RESULTS
comparable results were obtained from the  <dig> other subjects, . viewing the 3-d activity maps , it is evident that the low amplitude stimulus evokes a pattern with a much higher spatial frequency than that evoked by the higher amplitude stimulus. the third column also shows that in each subject there was a shift of the most prominent frequency band of the ois power spectrum from ~ <dig>  cycles/mm to ~ <dig> cycles/mm as the stimulus amplitude was increased from  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm, when the stimulus-evoked activity was sampled in the anterior-posterior dimension. in the medial-lateral dimension , no such shift in the power spectra was observed. low frequencies around 2– <dig>  cycles/mm dominate all of these spectra.

this effect of stimulus amplitude on the distribution of spatial frequencies in the ois response along the anterior-posterior dimension is highly reproducible across all subjects. figure 4a shows the average across-subject  power spectra, obtained in response to flutter stimuli delivered at  <dig> different amplitudes. the 6– <dig>  cycles/mm frequency band, which is most prominent in the absence of stimulation , loses relative power as stimulus amplitude is increased . in contrast, relative power at  <dig> – <dig> cycles/mm grows as stimulus amplitude is increased, and at the highest amplitude used  it greatly dominates the power spectrum . overall, the ois power spectrum appears to respond to an increase in stimulus amplitude by a shift of the relative power towards lower frequencies. this tendency is expressed more clearly in figure  <dig>  where the highest-power frequency  is plotted as a function of the stimulus amplitude.

stimulus duration appears to alter the spatial organization of si optical response to flutter in a manner similar to the alteration that accompanies an increase in stimulus amplitude. figure  <dig> displays the temporal evolution of the responses evoked by four different amplitudes. in each case, the pattern of absorbance evoked by the flutter stimulus appears to become more organized and periodic with time after the stimulus onset. in other words, with increasing stimulus duration, the local aggregates of above background absorbance tend to form larger clusters – which would lead to higher periodic values . the spatial frequency changes with stimulus duration were quantified in a manner similar to those that were used to quantify the spatial frequency characteristics that changed with stimulus amplitude. to give a representative example, figure  <dig> shows the temporal evolution of the si response of a subject to a  <dig> μm-amplitude flutter stimulus. the images in figure 7a were obtained  <dig> sec prior to stimulus onset , as well as at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sec after the onset of continuous skin flutter stimulation. the power spectra obtained from these images  show a systematic leftward shift of the dominant frequencies with increasing time after stimulus onset, from ~ <dig>  cycles/mm prior to stimulation, to ~ <dig> cycles/mm after  <dig> sec of continuous stimulation. the plots in figure 7c show that the 6– <dig>  cycles/mm frequency band, which is dominant in the resting state, loses relative power after onset of stimulation, and during this same time relative power within  <dig> – <dig> cycles/mm frequency band also becomes maximal.

discussion
spatial frequency analysis revealed that the si response to flutter stimulation produces systematic, spatially periodic fluctuations in the magnitude of the ois within the responding si region. in the absence of stimulation – the control condition – the power spectra have a small prevalence of spatial periodicities in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  mm. in contrast, in the presence of a prominent flutter stimulus spatial periodicities in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  mm dominate the stimulus-activated si region.

visual inspection of the 3-d activity plots , together with the results of spectral analyses performed along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral cortical dimensions, point to a substantial tendency of the stimulus-evoked activity to take a form of a pattern of roughly parallel elongated waves oriented in the anterior-posterior direction. these waves have a medio-lateral spacing of  <dig> – <dig>  mm between their crests. this tendency is already well developed in response to a relatively weak,  <dig> μm-amplitude flutter. at such weaker stimuli, each anterior-posteriorly oriented wave has a pattern of fine "ripples" along its long axis, with the dominant spatial periodicities in the neighborhood of  <dig> - <dig>  mm – values close to those characteristic of the ois in the no-stimulus condition. stronger stimuli lead to an emergence of larger spatial periodicities in the anterior-posterior dimension, up to  <dig>  mm. such a stimulus amplitude-dependent shift towards larger spatial periodicities suggests that the spatial pattern of si response to flutter stimulation undergoes substantial reorganization in response to changes in stimulus amplitude/intensity. that is, the stronger  stimuli have an effect of restructuring the anterior-posteriorly oriented waves by replacing the high-frequency ripples along their crests with more prominent ca.  <dig>  mm periodic fluctuations.

such a reorganization of stimulus-evoked ois spatial patterns apparently also occurs across time. that is, flutter stimulus-evoked ois patterns in the anterior-posterior dimension develop gradually from the resting state – dominated by high spatial frequencies – through a series of states characterized by progressively lower spatial frequencies. thus, the spatial organization of the patterned response evoked in si by a flutter stimulus varies with both stimulus strength and stimulus duration.

in interpreting the outcomes of our spatial frequency analyses, it is important that it be recognized that they were performed not on the si neuroelectrical responses to flutter stimulation, but on si optical responses to such stimulation. it now is well established that cortical neuroelectrical activity is positively and strongly correlated with the local increase in cortical tissue light absorbance  <cit> . although highly correlated with neuroelectrical activity, however, the ois is not a direct reflection of either neuronal spike discharge activity or, more generally, the local voltage changes evoked by a sensory stimulus. notably, it has a much slower onset and decay than the neuroelectrical responses of cortical cells. the intrinsic signal detected using the near-infrared light  is relatively independent of changes in blood flow  <cit> . the optical signal observed under near-infrared light reflects a variety of factors but, most significantly, change  in the volume of the extracellular fluid compartment attributable to the glial swelling due to stimulus-evoked changes in extracellular  and/or neurotransmitter release  <cit> . in view of these complex origins of the near-infrared ois, it remains to be determined whether the observed stimulus-dependent periodicities reflect the spatial organization of stimulus-evoked neuroelectrical activity. alternatively, the observed ois periodicities might reflect the spatial organization of the cortical glial reaction to local neuroelectrical activity, or si microvascular responses  <cit> , which become more prominent with increases in both stimulus strength and duration.

if the observed stimulus-dependent ois periodicities were to reflect neuroelectrical activity patterns, how well would they fit with the known features of si functional organization? in particular, a macrocolumnar functional organization has been well documented in si cortex. receptive field-mapping techniques have revealed that si cortex is partitioned into ~ <dig>  mm-wide submodality- and place-defined columns  <cit> . these topographic entities, repeating every  <dig>  mm, might indeed be responsible for the prominent  <dig>  mm periodicity in si ois stimulus-evoked activity patterns. if the spatial ois periodicities were due to selective modulation of entire macrocolumns , then the observed ois periodicities would be at least double the size of macrocolumns. since this is not the case, and the ois periodicities approximate the size of macrocolumns, the fractionation of the si response would appear to take place on the submacrocolumnar scale, with flutter stimuli preferentially activating only a subsector of each macrocolumn in the si region engaged by the stimulus. such preferentially activated subsectors would then form a roughly periodic pattern across the responding si region. in support of this proposal, chen et al.  <cit>  have reported that single skin taps,  <dig> hz flutter, and  <dig> hz vibration  were associated with preferential activation of different  <dig>  mm-diameter regions within the responding si territory. the small size of these regions suggests that they should occupy only a subsector of a typical submodality column, rather than a whole column  <cit> .

whether or not the  <dig>  mm periodicities in ois stimulus-response patterns in si owe their existence to submodality- and/or place-defined macrocolumns, the fact remains that a flutter stimulus activates multiple cortical loci, separated from each other by less active loci. such a locally selective distribution of activity in si is suggestive of the presence in si functional architecture of a mapping factor in addition to submodality and place on the skin – a factor specific to some yet to be explored attribute of mechanical skin stimulation. similarly, bruno and colleagues recently demonstrated that individual barrels in rat si contain minicolumns of neurons preferring the same whisker deflection angle and that these angular tuning domains could be the result of convergent inputs from thalamocortical cells with corresponding angular preferences  <cit> . it is possible that upon further investigation, the spatial activity patterns evoked in si cortex, such as the amplitude-dependent patterns described in this report, will also be found to be submodality-dependent as well.

finally, considering that spatial periodicities in si ois response patterns emerge gradually, and evolve with time after the stimulus onset, the fine sculpting of the si response might be the result of a network-level neurocomputational process that involves competitive and cooperative interactions among local neuronal aggregates. that is, si sensitivity to the stimulus attribute responsible for the observed fractionation of activity within the responding si region might be an emergent property of the si network , rather than a simple outcome of selective convergence of thalamocortical afferents on si neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
observations of the spatial patterns of si cortical response within an activated region, such as those evoked by flutter stimulation of the skin, suggest that evoked cortical activity within such a territory is not evenly distributed. furthermore, the cortical activity patterns change in a manner that appears to be dependent upon stimulus conditions. the observed spatiointensive fractionation on a sub-macrocolumnar scale of the si response to skin stimulation might be the product of local competitive interactions within the stimulus-activated si region, and as such can lead to new insights about the functional interactions that take place in the si cortex.
