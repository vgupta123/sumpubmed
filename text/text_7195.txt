BACKGROUND
glucosinolates are a group of secondary metabolites found exclusively in the plant kingdom, predominantly within the brassicaceae family. glucosinolates are substrates for endogenous thioglucosidases called myrosinases. following tissue disruption, glucosinolates are hydrolysed by myrosinases to produce compounds with a range of biological activities. these activities include the protection of the plant against pathogens and herbivores as well as plant recognition by specialist predators. glucosinolates are also responsible for the flavour and anti-carcinogenic properties of many brassica vegetables  <cit> . recent interest has focussed on the regulation of glucosinolate synthesis and the potential for manipulating glucosinolate profiles in food crops  <cit> .

the biosynthesis of glucosinolates occurs in three main stages. initially the precursor amino acids, such as phenylalanine and methionine may be elongated by the addition of one or several methylene groups. during the second stage the modified precursor amino acids are converted into glucosinolates , and finally secondary modification of the glucosinolate structure takes place  <cit> . modifications of the basic glucosinolate molecule create an enormous variety of glucosinolate structures. secondary modification such as oxidation, hydroxylation, methoxylation, desaturation and glycosylation primarily occurs on the methionine side chain and occasionally on the glucose moiety  <cit> . the side chain modification of the glucosinolate molecule is of particular importance as the structure of the side chain largely determines the nature of the products formed following glucosinolate hydrolysis by myrosinases  <cit> .

the major steps involved in 4c aliphatic glucosinolate side chain modification are outlined in figure  <dig>  following the formation of methylthioalkyl glucosinolate from methionine, an initial oxidation occurs, catalyzed by the product of the gs-ox locus to form methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate. further modification of the side chain is performed by the protein products of the gs-alk and gs-ohp loci  <cit> . in arabidopsis the gs-alk and gs-ohp loci map to a region near the top of chromosome four, termed the gs-aop locus  <cit>  and fine scale mapping has led to the identification of the three genes, aop <dig>  aop <dig> and aop <dig>  that encode 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases  <cit> . the gs-alk  locus protein product is responsible for the formation of alkenyl glucosinolates whilst the gs-ohp  locus protein product is thought to be responsible for the formation of hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates  <cit> . the alkenyl glucosinolate can also be further hydroxylated through the action of the gs-oh locus protein product  <cit> .

the aop <dig> gene is believed to be the ancestral gene that gave rise to aop <dig> and aop <dig> through a series of gene duplication events. currently the function of aop <dig> is unknown  <cit> . heterologous expression in escherichia coli has shown that aop <dig> catalyses the conversion of 3-methylsulfinylpropyl- and 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolates to the corresponding alkenyl glucosinolates, 2-propenyl and 3-butenyl, respectively. the heterologous expression of aop <dig> displayed only a weak conversion of 3-methylsulfinylpropyl glucosinolate to 3-hydroxypropyl glucosinolate  <cit> . however, in the accessions examined a perfect correlation was reported between the expression of a functional aop <dig> and aop <dig> and the accumulation of alkenyl and hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates, respectively  <cit> . arabidopsis displays differential aop leaf expression whereby a particular accession expresses either aop <dig> or aop <dig> or neither, but not both, and in some arabidopsis accessions the absence of both functional enzymes leads to the accumulation of the precursor methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate  <cit> .

the aop <dig> homologue  from collard  has been cloned and characterised and it was found that the gene product is able to catalyse the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate to the alkenyl form in planta  <cit> . broccoli, on the other hand, contains a non-functional allele of bogsl-alk and hence accumulates the 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate, glucoraphanin  <cit> . the accumulation of glucoraphanin is of particular importance as the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin by myrosinase leads to the production of the isothiocyanate, sulforaphane, which is a major inducer of phase ii detoxification enzymes that are important in chemoprotection from carcinogens  <cit> .

it is thought that natural variation at the aop locus, in particular the differential expression of the aop <dig> and aop <dig> genes, accounts for a large amount of the variation in the glucosinolate profiles and the levels of glucosinolate accumulation found between different arabidopsis accessions  <cit> . a mechanism for the differential leaf expression, whereby a particular accession transcribes either aop <dig> or aop <dig> but not both, has recently been reported to be due a complete inversion of the aop <dig> and aop <dig> structural genes in some accessions, causing the aop <dig> gene to be expressed from the aop <dig> promoter  <cit> . the important role that aop <dig> plays as part of a feedback loop which regulates the transcription of other aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes has also been reported, however, the mechanisms underlying this regulation have not yet been elucidated  <cit> . due to the key role that the aop <dig> structural gene and promoter plays in the aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway, the aop <dig> coding sequence and 5'regulatory region has been characterised in a range of accessions in this report.

the accumulation of glucosinolates has been well studied in arabidopsis. an extensive survey of the glucosinolates accumulated in the arabidopsis accession col- <dig> demonstrated that the composition and concentration of glucosinolates varies both developmentally and spatially. it was found that dormant and germinating seeds contain the highest glucosinolate concentration and diversity, followed by inflorescences, siliques, leaves and roots  <cit> . this pattern of accumulation has also been found in other glucosinolate producing species  <cit>  and correlates with the current theories on the optimal distribution of defence substances which state that the maximum level of protection is provided to the plants' reproductive tissues  <cit> . in this study the spatial pattern of aop <dig> transcript accumulation was examined.

the accumulation of glucosinolates in various plants species is also influenced by many environmental factors  <cit> . climatic and seasonal conditions have long been known to influence glucosinolate concentration in various crop species  <cit> . glucosinolate levels have also been found to vary throughout the day, with a two-fold change in total glucosinolate concentration being recorded in b. oleracea during one diurnal cycle  <cit> . it was found that the concentration of 3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate was reduced in brassica napus seedlings when kept in darkness for  <dig> hours  <cit> . it has also been found that watercress  accumulates higher levels of the glucosinolate, gluconasturtiin, when grown under long day conditions  <cit> . currently little is known about changes in glucosinolate accumulation in response to environmental factors in arabidopsis. in particular, little is known about the environmental factors that activate or repress glucosinolate biosynthetic genes  <cit> . therefore a study was initiated to investigate the level of transcript accumulation of the aop <dig> gene in response to light.

as many plant species within the brassicaceae are important crop plants, the ability to alter glucosinolate profiles in planta is potentially valuable from an agricultural perspective. therefore the current study also aimed to demonstrate that the arabidopsis aop <dig> gene product is functional in planta. this was done through the introduction of the aop <dig> gene from the arabidopsis pitztal accession  into the columbia accession. it was shown that columbia plants accumulate methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates and it was hypothesised that the introduction of this gene would result in the conversion of the precursor methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate to the alkenyl glucosinolate form.

RESULTS
aop <dig> gene expression in the leaves of five arabidopsis accessions
the accumulation of the aop <dig> transcript in the leaves of five arabidopsis accessions: col, cvi, ler, pi and st, was investigated. northern blot analysis indicates that of these accessions, cvi and pi exhibit high levels of aop <dig> gene expression, whereas ler and st display low or undetectable levels of aop <dig> gene expression . figure  <dig> also indicates that leaf expression of aop <dig> in col is not detectable by northern analysis. expression of a non-functional aop <dig> transcript in the col accession has previously been reported  <cit> . our inability to detect the aop <dig> message in the leaves of col suggests that the gene may be transcribed at a low level and/or the transcript may be unstable.

analysis of the aop <dig> structural gene
the aop <dig> structural gene was sequenced in col and the two aop2-expressing accessions  and two aop3-expressing accessions . the sequenced region encompassed all introns and exons between the translation initiating atg codon and the stop codon. intron/exon boundaries were predicted from the cvi sequences using the genscan program found at  and confirmed by sequencing rt-pcr products. the aop <dig> gene was predicted to contain three exons at positions 1- <dig>  588- <dig>  and 1647- <dig> bp .

the aop <dig> gene sequence exhibits complete identity between the five accessions across introns and exons with the exception of three regions in exon two where polymorphisms were found to occur . the aop <dig> allele present in the cvi and st accessions was named allele  <dig> , the pi allele which contains two polymorphisms  was named allele  <dig> , whereas the col and ler alleles that contain these two polymorphisms as well as an additional  <dig> bp frame shift deletion was named allele  <dig> .

the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp polymorphisms cause a nine amino acid difference between the predicted protein product encoded by the aop2- <dig> and aop2- <dig> alleles .. if the aop2- <dig> transcript containing the  <dig> bp deletion was translated, the frame shift would result in a truncated protein of  <dig> amino acids being produced, which is in agreement with the col aop <dig> gene product  having been reported as non-functional  <cit> .

exon  <dig> from aop <dig> in twelve additional accessions was amplified and sequenced . six of these accessions  generated sequence characteristic of the aop2- <dig> allele, whereas the accessions c <dig>  can-o, cond, sha and sorbo generated sequence characteristic of the aop2- <dig> allele, whilst la-o appears to harbour the aop2- <dig> allele. northern analyses show that the six accessions analysed containing the aop2- <dig> allele accumulate aop <dig> transcript in the leaves, whereas leaf aop <dig> expression in the three accessions containing aop2- <dig> could not be detected. the presence of the aop2- <dig> allele does not correlate either positively or negatively with aop <dig> expression as four of the aop2- <dig> containing accessions accumulate leaf aop <dig> transcripts and four accumulate leaf aop <dig> transcripts .

aop <dig> spatial expression profile
an analysis of the aop <dig> transcript levels in various organs  of pi and ler plants grown in cl was conducted . leaf tissue was collected at the four leaf stage of vegetative growth from ler and the six leaf stage from pi. the stem, root and floral tissues were collected from both types of plant approximately four days after the plants had formed floral bolts. in pi the highest level of the aop <dig> transcript was detected in the leaf tissue and the transcript was also found to accumulate in stem tissue and to a lesser extent in the floral organs. the root tissue and dormant seeds displayed little or no detectable aop <dig> transcript. no aop <dig> expression was detected in pi plants whereas ler accumulated aop <dig> transcript in the same spatial pattern as that exhibited by aop <dig> in pi . as expected, no aop <dig> expression was found in any part of the ler accession plant. this indicates that, at least in the plant organs of the accessions tested, the accession-specific leaf expression of the aop <dig> and aop <dig> genes extends to the other tissues.

a comparison of the aop <dig> 5' regulatory region amongst accessions
two kb of the 5' regulatory region upstream of the aop <dig> gene was sequenced with the intention of identifying any promoter differences between aop2-expressing accessions  and col which could help explain the different expression profiles observed amongst these accessions. the aop <dig> non-expressing accessions  were also included in the analyses. interestingly, the col and pi 5' regulatory region sequences were found to be identical to each other , notwithstanding the substantial difference in aop <dig> transcript accumulation levels in these two accessions. this study has detected no aop <dig> expression in the col accession using either northern analysis  or rt-pcr, although it has previously been reported that a low level of aop <dig> transcript  is detectable in col by rt-pcr  <cit> . this suggests that the aop2- <dig> transcript, which encodes a non-functional protein, may be degraded rapidly.

it has previously been reported that the ler accession contains a complete inversion of the aop <dig> and aop <dig> structural genes that may have resulted in a promoter exchange. this would suggest that this regulatory region may be driving aop <dig> leaf expression in ler  <cit> . gene-specific primers were used to investigate the physical juxtaposition of the aop2/ <dig> regulatory regions and the aop2/ <dig> structural genes in ler. the primers were designed to amplify a fragment extending around  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream from the initiating atg codon. both col and pi were included as controls. amplifications using mixed primers were included in an attempt to detect any aop promoter-cds linkage anomalies. the mixed aop2/ <dig> primer combinations generated no fragments amongst these accessions . the aop <dig> promoter-aop <dig> cds primer combination generated the expected fragments in the three accessions, whereas the aop <dig> combination generated a fragment in col and pi but not ler despite repeated attempts. sequencing of the aop <dig> ler pcr fragment  indicates that in ler the proximal  <dig> nucleotides of aop <dig> regulatory region is linked to the aop <dig> cds . the sequence from the overlapping regulatory region fragments extend this linkage  <dig> kb upstream indicating that an inversion has not occurred within  <dig> kb upstream of the aop <dig> structural gene in the ler accession used in this study.

the comparison between the regulatory regions upstream of the aop <dig> structural gene in the aop2-expressing  and aop <dig> non-expressing  accessions found only a small number of exclusive differences, comprised of single and double base pair substitutions and insertion/deletions, and one  <dig> bp deletion. the majority of these differences are clustered around nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> upstream of the atg . no potential cis-acting elements  were identified in this region and it is not clear that these minor changes would explain the substantial difference in the leaf level of aop <dig> transcript observed amongst these accessions.

aop <dig> expression is regulated by light
several light-responsive elements were identified in the aop <dig> 5' regulatory region  including gt-boxes and gata/i-boxes  <cit> . the aop <dig> promoter also contains a cbs element that is found in the promoters of many clock-regulated genes that have a peak of expression around mid-day  <cit>  although harmer & kay  <cit>  suggest that cbs does not act alone to specify circadian phase. one me and one tbx element  <cit>  are also found in the aop <dig> promoter. these elements, along with flanking sequences are thought to specify the time of day phase and level of transcriptional activity through interactions with photocycles, thermocycles and the circadian clock  <cit> . interestingly, the aop <dig> promoter contains a number of forca elements which occur in arabidopsis genes that are up-regulated in response to oomycete and fungal infection  <cit> . similar elements  are found in the ler aop <dig> promoter . the positions of the elements in the aop <dig> promoter sequence are highlighted in figure  <dig>  sequence polymorphisms between the aop2-expressing accessions  and non-expressing accessions  lead to the disruption of only one putative gt box response element in the non-expressing accessions at position  <dig> .

an examination of the microarray data located at "the diurnal project"  shows aop <dig> exhibiting a very low level of expression in col that peaks around midday when plants are grown in ld conditions at constant temperature  <cit> . however, this microarray-based aop <dig> expression pattern in col is very similar in both amplitude and phase to that depicted for aop <dig> in ler, which is generally accepted as being an aop <dig> non-expressor. this contrast with the aop <dig> expression pattern in ler which shows a substantially higher diurnal expression with a maximum at zt  <dig> under ld conditions. since neither of the accessions utilized in "the diurnal project" express substantial levels of aop <dig> transcript, the accumulation of the aop <dig> transcript in pi plants under various light conditions at a constant temperature was investigated. the pi plants, which express aop <dig> but not aop <dig>  were initially grown under long day  conditions  until they had reached the six-leaf stage. the plants were then transferred to either short day  conditions , continuous light  or remained under ld conditions. samples were collected at 4-hour intervals and the transcript level of the aop <dig> gene was subsequently analysed by northern blot . the aop <dig> transcript was detectable in plants exposed to light, however it was found that when the plants entered a dark period the expression of aop <dig> decreased to an almost undetectable level within four hours in both ld  and sd  conditions. when plants again entered a light period the transcript level returned to a detectable level within a few hours. plants that were transferred from ld conditions to cl showed relatively constant expression of aop <dig>  whereas no transcript was detectable at all in plants transferred to continuous darkness. hence no evidence of aop <dig> transcript oscillations in the absence of environmental stimuli was obtained.

constitutive expression of the aop2- <dig> allele in the col background alters the glucosinolate profile
transgenic arabidopsis lines were created in the col accession. col expresses low levels of aop <dig>  and no aop <dig> transcript. absence or low levels of aop <dig> or aop <dig> expression should result in accumulation of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate  <cit>  in the col accession, whereas the introduction of a functional aop <dig> gene would be expected to convert methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate to the alkenyl glucosinolate form. the aop2pi gene  from the pi accession driven by the camv35s promoter was used to create a 35s:aop2pi line in the col accession.

ten independent transformants were obtained. following confirmation of the presence of the construct by the amplification of the expected  <dig> bp pcr fragment, the transcript levels from the aop <dig> gene within those lines was analysed. northern blot analysis  shows the presence of aop <dig> transcript in all the appropriate transgenic lines. rna from an aop <dig> expressing accession  was included as a positive control . the inclusion of wild-type col rna on the northern blot shows that the low expression of aop <dig> was not detectable by northern analysis in untransformed col plants. a degree of variability in the transcript levels of the aop <dig> gene is observed in the transformed lines.

hplc analysis of the transgenic lines was conducted to determine whether the introduction of aop <dig> into the col background alters the glucosinolate profile. five t <dig> generation homozygous aop <dig> lines were obtained and used for hplc analysis. the selected lines were 35s:aop2pi:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the typical hplc result obtained for wild-type col. the identities of the peaks were confirmed using standards and peaks  <dig> and  <dig> were found to correspond to the two precursor glucosinolates present in wild-type col, 3-methylsulfinylpropyl  and 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolates , respectively. the hplc analysis of col accession was repeated several times with similar results and corresponds with the profile reported in the literature  <cit> .

discussion
much of the genetic and phenotypic diversity evident in natural arabidopsis accessions occurs as a result of drastic mutations, such as deletions and nucleotide changes resulting in the introduction of stop codons. in some cases these changes occur in several accessions which suggest they may be adaptive  <cit> . in the present study, three aop <dig> alleles were identified based on the presence or absence of polymorphisms, which were all located in the second exon. when compared with aop2- <dig> , the allele, termed aop2- <dig>  was found to contain one  <dig> bp and one  <dig> bp deletion polymorphism, in addition to the  <dig> bp deletion polymorphism previously identified  <cit> . the col and ler accessions were found to possess the aop2- <dig> allele and aop <dig> transcript was not detected in the leaves of either of these accessions. if the aop2- <dig> allele is transcribed, the  <dig> bp mutation would cause the introduction of a series of stop codons in the transcript, which may have a negative effect on mrna stability  <cit> . it should be noted that the ler accession used in the previous study  <cit>  was found not to possess the  <dig> bp polymorphism in exon  <dig>  whereas the ler used in the current study was found to possess the aop2- <dig> allele containing the  <dig> bp deletion. the expression of aop <dig> in the leaves was not detected in the ler accession used in either study  <cit> . in addition, the pi- <dig> accession used in the previous study was found to express aop <dig> instead of aop <dig>  <cit> , whereas the pi accession used in the current study displays aop <dig> leaf expression exclusively. these discrepancies are most likely due to the use of different pi and ler strains. the pi and ler used in the present study are laboratory strains that have been selected over a number of years.

the aop2- <dig> allele that was found to be transcribed in our pi accessions does not contain the  <dig> bp deletion but does contain the two in-frame  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp deletion polymorphisms. this would result in a predicted protein product nine amino acids shorter than aop <dig>  <dig>  these polymorphisms occur in a region of the aop <dig> protein that contains several asparagine, valine and alanine rich repeats. our results, in conjunction with previously reported results  <cit> , indicate that both aop2- <dig> and aop2- <dig> encode functional protein products.

the aop2- <dig> allele was present in both cvi and st but only expressed in cvi and not the st accession. st expresses aop <dig> in the leaves . as the st aop2- <dig> allele does not contain the  <dig> bp deletion, mechanisms other than mrna instability arising from a frame shift mutation are likely to be responsible for the lack of aop <dig> expression in st.

the aop <dig> 5' regulatory region was examined for differences between the aop2-expressing  and aop <dig> non-expressing  accessions. no sequence differences in the aop <dig> 5' regulatory regions differentiating the aop2-expressing and aop <dig> non-expressing accessions were detected within  <dig> kb of the atg initiation codon amongst any of these accessions and only a few minor differences were found within the  <dig> kb analysed further upstream. in addition, none of the major primary sequence differences found in the aop2-expressing accessions correlate with the level of aop <dig> transcripts. hence it is likely that primary sequence differences found in the aop <dig> promoter regions do not account for the variation in aop <dig> transcript expression levels amongst the accessions analysed, although reporter gene experiments are needed to confirm this.

differential aop2/ <dig> expression in the leaves of arabidopsis accessions has been reported as being associated with an aop2/ <dig> structural gene inversion and aop2/ <dig> promoter swap . in the ler accession, which expresses aop <dig> in the leaves, such an inversion would be expected to bring the ler aop <dig> cds under the control of the aop <dig> regulatory region. our results suggest that an inversion has not occurred within the  <dig> kb upstream of aop <dig> in our ler accession or within the  <dig> kb upstream of the aop <dig> gene in those accessions analysed that express aop <dig>  it should be noted that our results do not preclude an inversion/s having occurred outside the regions analysed which may bring the aop regulatory regions under flanking epigentic influences that regulate the spatial expression of the aop genes. our inability to obtain a product using the aop2-specific primers on ler dna may indicate a rearrangement has occurred in the aop <dig> region that affects primer hybridization or amplification. faint larger bands in the aop <dig> primer ler reaction as well as some bands originating from the use of mixed aop2/ <dig> primer combinations on other arabidopsis accessions occurred on occasion but these results were difficult to reproduce. nevertheless the results raise the possibility that a variety of rearrangements may have occurred in the aop region amongst arabidopsis accessions. this warrants further investigation given the implications for glucosinolate production and plant-insect interactions. other regulatory mechanism differences associated with transcription factor activity or differential mrna stability may also need to be investigated in order to fully understand the regulation of aop expression.

the spatial expression analysis showed high levels of aop <dig> transcript were present in the vegetative leaves of pi. although there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the site of gene expression and metabolite accumulation, this correlates with reports that aliphatic glucosinolates, in particular c <dig> and c <dig> alkenyl, hydroxyalkyl and methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates, accumulate to high levels in arabidopsis vegetative leaf tissue  <cit> .

it has been reported that arabidopsis roots accumulate a similar glucosinolate profile to that of rosette leaves, except that they contain a greater proportion of indole glucosinolate  <cit> . this spatial and temporal analysis of glucosinolates was conducted in the col- <dig> arabidopsis accession, which contains non-functional alleles of aop <dig> and aop <dig> and thus, does not accumulate alkenyl or hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates  <cit> . in the current study the aop <dig> transcript level was analysed in the pi and ler accessions and was found to be at low to undetectable levels in the roots and we have been unable to detect root aop <dig> in either accession. therefore it is possible that the lack of a substantial aop <dig> transcript level would correlate with a lack of alkenyl glucosinolates in arabidopsis roots in general. it is also interesting to note that substantial aop <dig> expression is only observed in photosynthetic regions of the plant. thus, it would be interesting to determine whether aop <dig> transcript is detectable in light grown roots, and if so, whether the change in gene expression would result in the expected alteration in glucosinolate composition. a study has recently been conducted using arabidopsis roots to analyse phenylpropanoid accumulation. it was reported that monolignol glucoside and flavonoid accumulation are induced by light in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . the response to light was found to require proteins involved in photomorphogenesis and was repressed by proteins involved in skotomorphogenesis. the light-induced accumulation of monolignol glucosides and flavonoids in root tissue was also found to involve changes in the level and cell specificity of phenylpropanoid gene expression  <cit> .

as the levels of many secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, phenylpropanoids and glucosinolates have been reported to be influenced by light  <cit>  the effect of light on the level of aop <dig> transcript in the leaves was analysed in the pi accession throughout a diurnal cycle and it was found that the levels of the transcript varied dramatically. high levels of transcript are observed in light periods, however during dark periods the transcript was found to decrease to an almost undetectable level . this suggests there is a light requirement for aop <dig> transcript accumulation. this is supported by our spatial analysis. multiple gt- and gata/i-boxes were identified in the aop <dig> 5' regulatory region  and these may be important in the light-mediated regulation of the gene. the aop <dig> 5'regulatory region was found to have three main regions containing five, three and two light responsive elements. a high degree of degeneracy has been reported for the gt-boxes  <cit> . therefore, as there may be additional motifs within the outlined regions that contain gt-boxes that were not detected by the bioinformatics packages, functional analysis will need to be conducted to determine which regions are critical for the light-responsive regulation of aop <dig>  in ler, the aop <dig> transcript also accumulates preferentially in light grown plants  although the aop <dig> transcript does not drop as dramatically in the dark as does the aop <dig> transcripts in pi plants.

the forca elements found in the aop <dig> promoter are activators of oomycete- and fungal-pathogen response genes under continuous light, but acts as a repressor under long days and prolonged darkness  to midnight  suggesting that the forca elements may play a role in regulating aop expression.

the activity of the arabidopsis aop <dig> gene has previously been investigated by the heterologous expression of the aop <dig> protein in e. coli and it was reported that the conversion of the precursor methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolate to the alkenyl glucosinolate forms is controlled by the aop <dig> gene  <cit> . to demonstrate the activity of aop <dig> in planta, ten independent lines over-expressing the aop <dig> gene from the pi accession were created. pcr analysis, designed to amplify a junction fragment spanning the 35s promoter, confirmed that all of the lines contain the appropriate constructs. the northern blot analysis of the ten lines showed expression of the appropriate transgene in all of the lines. the variability in transgene transcript levels in this analysis may be explained by position effects  <cit> , gene copy number  <cit>  and the varying ratios of heterozygous and homozygous t <dig> plants included in the pooled samples analysed.

the glucosinolate profiles in the five 35s:aop2pi over-expressing t <dig> lines analysed by hplc showed that the aop2- <dig> allele catalysed the conversion of the two precursor methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates to 2-propenyl and 3-butenyl glucosinolates. in the majority of lines tested, the extent of conversion to 3-butenyl glucosinolate was substantial and provides the first demonstration of manipulation of the glucosinolate pathway utilising the activity of arabidopsis aop <dig> in planta. a previous study has also shown in planta modification of the glucosinolate profile in the col arabidopsis accession by the introduction of the brassica oleracea aop <dig> homologue . it was found that boglucosinolate-alk is able to convert more than 80% of the 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate precursor into 3-butenyl glucosinolate, and the 3-methylsulfinylpropyl glucosinolate precursor into 2-propenyl glucosinolate  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
an examination of the aop <dig> gene across several arabidopsis accessions has revealed that the structural gene encoding aop <dig> has three alleles. while one of the aop <dig> alleles  encodes a truncated protein which is unlikely to be functional, the other alleles  have now been demonstrated to be functional in planta. no major differences where identified in the sequence of the aop <dig> 5'regulatory region between the accessions. aop <dig> expression in leaf tissue is light regulated and numerous putative light response elements are found within the 5' regulatory region of the aop <dig> gene. furthermore, aop <dig> transcript was found to accumulate predominantly in photosynthetic regions of the plant, with little or no transcript present in root and seeds.
