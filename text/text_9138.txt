BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni consists of two subspecies: c. jejuni subsp. jejuni  and c. jejuni subsp. doylei . cjd strains originally were identified as gastric campylobacters from human gastric biopsies  <cit>  and nitrate-negative campylobacters from pediatric patients with gastroenteritis  <cit> . the major phenotypic characteristic commonly used to distinguish cjd strains from cjj strains, is the inability of cjd to reduce nitrate. other phenotypic characteristics also associated with cjd include variable growth at 42°c  <cit> , high susceptibility to cephalothin  <cit> , and the absence of γ-glutamyl transferase  and l-arginine arylamidase activity  <cit> . however, like cjj, all cjd strains are hippuricase positive.

in clinically-related aspects, cjd strains also differ from cjj. first, cjd strains cause both gastritis  <cit>  and enteritis  <cit> , and often are isolated from pediatric patients  <cit> . second, cjd strains are isolated more often from blood cultures than from stool cultures  <cit> . moreover, morey reported that cjd was isolated from  <dig> % of campylobacter/helicobacter-related bacteremia cases in australia during a five-year period  <cit> . additionally, cjd was isolated from  <dig> % of the campylobacter-positive stool cultures but 24% of the campylobacter-positive blood cultures  <cit> , obtained at red cross children's hospital, cape town, during the years 1977– <dig> 

despite the unusual clinical symptomatology, cjd is isolated infrequently and few strains exist  for this subspecies. one possible reason is that many clinical laboratories do not characterize campylobacter isolates past the genus level or subspeciate c. jejuni isolates as cjj or cjd. moreover, normal cjj culturing methods select against cjd that are susceptible to cephalothin and exhibit variable growth at 42°c. this appears to be supported by the fact that in south africa, cjd strains represent a significant proportion of the total campylobacters isolated from human clinical samples; where 16% of the non-cjj/coli campylobacter isolates were cjd. these isolates were obtained using the cape town protocol  <cit>  which uses passive filtration through a  <dig>  μm membrane filter, growth at 37°c and no antibiotic selection.

multilocus sequence typing   <cit>  and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization   <cit>  have been utilized by several groups to assess genomic diversity and index the gene content of hundreds of c. jejuni strains. in particular, these cgh or comparative gene indexing  studies identified regions of intraspecies hypervariability, such as the lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis , capsular biosynthesis , flagellar modification , and dna restriction/modification  loci  <cit> . furthermore, dna sequencing of certain intraspecies hypervariable loci identified diversity in both the dna sequence of common genes and the gene composition at each locus.  <cit> .

in this study, we have exploited the sequencing of housekeeping genes  and dna microarray-based cgi to examine the genomic relationship between cjd strains, to determine the relationship between cjd and cjj strains, and to identify possible genomic factors that may have contributed to the emergence of cjd strains. the mlst indicated that cjd strains in our geographically diverse collection are highly related. moreover, cgi analysis identified genomic regions that are commonly absent from cjd strains and may contribute to their pathogenic characteristics.

RESULTS
sequence typing of cjd strains
multilocus sequence typing  of the eight cjd strains listed in table  <dig> identified six novel sequence types  . prior to this study, no cjd sts were present  in the campylobacter jejuni/coli mlst database. it was intriguing that all eight cjd strains contained the same aspa allele, aspa <dig>  considering the geographical and temporal range of the strains. however, aspa has been shown previously to be associated also with a subgroup of campylobacters ; therefore, it is possible that aspa is linked to a locus important for colonization or virulence, and that conservation at this locus is maintained by interstrain recombination. the aspa <dig> allele has been identified only three times before, in sts st- <dig>  st- <dig> and st- <dig>  the phylogenetic relationship between the six cjd sts and representative cjj and c. coli  sts was also determined . the housekeeping gene sequences of each st were concatenated and aligned. the cjd strains form a distinct clade within the resulting dendogram supporting their subspecies designation. a similar organization of cjd strains into a distinct cluster was observed previously using aflp  <cit>  and were observed in this study also by comparative genomic indexing .

the presence of a single cjd cluster invites the possibility that cjd strains form a discrete group within the species and that no  genetic exchange occurs between the two subspecies. unfortunately, the resolution of such hypotheses by this study are hindered by the small size of the mlst-typed cjd sample set  and the high frequency of novel mlst alleles among the cjd strains. with the exception of strain  <dig> , the cjd strains characterized in this study each possess six novel mlst alleles, with the seventh allele being the aspa <dig> allele described above. thus, eburst analysis, using  <dig> c. jejuni  sts and a group definition of four common alleles, was not particularly informative ; st- <dig> and st- <dig> formed a two-st clonal complex, st- <dig>  formed a clonal complex with st- <dig>  and the remaining three cjd sts were singletons. although the presence of st- <dig> in the same clonal complex as  <dig>  might indicate lateral gene exchange between the two subspecies, it is unclear from the data available if the strain representing st- <dig> is a cjj or a cjd. the same could be said, presumably, for a large number of strains within the c. jejuni mlst database that may not have been identified to the subspecies level. therefore, to determine the nature of the origin and/or evolution of the cjd subspecies and to determine whether cjd alleles arise through the accumulation of point mutations or through a more rapid mechanism of exchange and recombination, additional experiments and analyses will be necessary. such experiments would entail the characterization of a much larger and geographically diverse set of cjd strains and the further identification of strains within the c. jejuni mlst database to the subspecies level. characterization of additional cjd strains might explain also the noteworthy conservation of the aspa <dig> allele within the subspecies.

comparative genomic indexing of the cjd strains
we further examined the genomic diversity of these eight cjd strains more comprehensively by comparative genomic indexing  analysis. the cgi analysis allowed the assessment of gene content for each cjd strain relative to the multi-strain c. jejuni dna microarray, described previously  <cit> , that comprises  <dig> genes from nctc  <dig> and  <dig> genes from rm <dig>  genomic dnas from both nctc  <dig> and rm <dig> were used as a reference dna mixture and competitively hybridized with genomic dna from each of the cjd strains. we observed that  <dig> %  of the genes represented on the microarray were highly divergent or absent  in at least one cjd strain and  <dig> of these genes were absent from all of  <dig> of the cjd strains in this study. in comparison, we observed  <dig> %  of the genes were highly divergent or absent in at least  <dig> of  <dig> geographically and temporally diverse cjj strains from both humans and animals using this microarray  <cit> . the cgi data sets as trinary scores for the cjd strains are available as an additional table .

using cluster analysis, we examined the genomic relationship between the cjd strains and these  <dig> diverse cjj strains that were analyzed previously  <cit> . figure  <dig> depicts the relationship among the strains using a standard correlation function and bootstrapping  where the linkage distance between strains is represented by branch lengths in the resulting hierarchical cluster. these microarray-based cgi results at the whole genome level demonstrate that the cjd strains formed a discrete cluster, correlating well with our mlst dendogram.

intraspecies hypervariability regions and genomic elements
as with cjj strains, the majority of genes that were divergent in the cjd strains were contained within described regions of intraspecies plasticity /hypervariability  [e.g. hv regions 1– <dig>  <cit>  and regions pr1-pr <dig>  <cit> . the cjd strains exhibited identical presence/absence patterns for genes within  <dig> of the  <dig> intraspecies hypervariability regions described recently  <cit> . interestingly, the genes cj0728-cj <dig> within hv region  <dig> that were shown recently to be phosphate-regulated  <cit>  were absent or highly divergent in all of the cjd strains examined. it should be noted that the cjd strains were not all identical at the hypervariable regions related to surface structures, including the lipooligosaccharide  biosynthesis locus   <cit> , the flagellar modification locus   <cit> , and the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis locus   <cit> . furthermore, all of the cjd strains were distinct from both nctc  <dig> and rm <dig> in these three hv regions. this suggests that the cjd strains do not produce one distinct set of surface molecules, nor do they produce the same surface molecules observed for either nctc  <dig> or rm <dig> 

we previously demonstrated the occurrence of four campylobacter jejuni integrated elements , similar to those identified in rm <dig>  in other strains of c. jejuni  <cit> . the cjie <dig>  cjie <dig> and cjie <dig> show similarity to bacteriophage while cjie <dig> may be an integrated plasmid. for cjd strains, fewer than  <dig> genes from the campylobacter mu-like phage  or cjie <dig> were present. we observed that strain rm <dig> possessed a majority of the genes within cjie <dig> described in strain rm <dig>  <cit> , while cjd strains rm <dig>  rm <dig> and rm <dig> possessed a smaller number of genes within cjie <dig> . although not visible in figure  <dig>  these same strains  also possessed a cluster of genes from cjie <dig> , suggesting the possibility that a plasmid  is present in these strains.

common deletions in cjd strains
the cjd strains also had missing genes outside the c. jejuni intraspecies hypervariable regions. indeed,  <dig> genes not identified previously within the c. jejuni hypervariable regions, but missing from at least half of the cjd strains, is presented in table  <dig>  of these,  <dig> genes were absent from all cjd strains  and  <dig> genes were detected in only one cjd strain . the largest clusters of highly divergent loci contained three genes , with the remainder distributed uniformly throughout the chromosome, assuming genomic positions similar to the two sequenced cjj strains. the majority  of the cjd highly-divergent loci encode proteins with unknown or general function. the remaining genes, such as argbc, napab,proa, dcub, ceucd, and sdac, mostly encode metabolic or transport proteins. furthermore, the microarray results suggest that the observed absence of nitrate reductase activity in cjd strains is due most likely to deletions in napa and/or napb. we have confirmed recently these nap mutations by pcr and sequencing and our evidence strongly suggests that cjd arose from a single evolutionary event, i.e. the napa deletion, with the divergence at napb occurring subsequently  <cit> . despite these results, these metabolic and transport-related genes provide too few clues into their possible role in cjd pathogenicity.

the total absence of the virulence gene cdta  among the cjd strains, however, may be related to pathogenicity . the cdt genes encode subunits of the cytolethal distending toxin , indicating that cjd strains do not produce this toxin. as cdt has been associated with virulence properties in c. jejuni  <cit> , and cjd has been isolated almost exclusively from human clinical samples, it is intriguing to speculate what role loss of a virulence factor plays in cjd pathogenicity. specifically, cdt from c.jejuni has been shown to arrest eukaryotic cells in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle  <cit>  and induces the release of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin- <dig>   <cit> . it is possible that due to the absence of cdt,cjd strains fail to induce the release of il- <dig> and this may be responsible partly for the much higher incidence of cjd in blood cultures compared to cjj. interestingly, deletions of portions of cdta and cdtb have recently been reported for three cdt-negative c. jejuni strains that were also isolated from patients with bacteremia  <cit> . this further supports a relationship between the absence of cdt genes and bacteremia; however, it is not clear if the strains examined in that study were cjj or cjd. additionally, cgh experiments comparing  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> , or  <dig>  <cit> cjj strains reported complete conservation of the cdt locus across this subspecies, suggesting that production of cdt may be yet another marker that distinguishes cjj and cjd.

CONCLUSIONS
although cjd strains have been distinguished from cjj strains, due to phenotypic characteristics associated with cjd strains, including the inability to reduce nitrate, high susceptibility to cephalothin and variable growth at 42°c  <cit> , the genomic relationship between these subspecies has not been reported previously. two types of genomic relationships between the two subspecies were possible: first, that the cjd strains represented a phylogenetically- and phenotypically-distinct clade within c. jejuni and second, that the two subspecies were indistinguishable phylogenetically but possessed unique phenotypic characteristics. initial studies that differentiated campylobacters by amplified fragment length polymorphism  profiling  <cit>  suggested that the first possibility was the most likely. consistent with these observations, using mlst and cgi analysis, we confirmed in this study that cjd strains are phylogenetically distinct from cjj strains. indeed, all of the cjd strains examined from our geographically diverse collection had the same aspa <dig> allele and possessed a common set of absent or highly variable genes. this set of genes included both genes in the intrastrain hv regions and  <dig> genes outside these regions. moreover, we recently demonstrated that the loss of nitrate reductase activity in  <dig> cjd strains was the result of an identical  <dig> bp deletion in the nitrate reductase large subunit-encoding gene, napa  <cit> . also, there is a high frequency of novel mlst alleles among the cjd strains. together, these analyses suggest that cjd strains arose from a common ancestor. considering c. jejuni is generally a non-clonal organism with a high frequency of gene exchange, it is possible that cjd strains are ecologically isolated from cjj strains, with mlst alleles arising mainly by mutation rather than recombination. however, it is also possible that cjd strains share the same environment with cjj strains but have a barrier to recombination. characterization of additional cjd strains might provide clues as to the potential evolutionary origin of cjd and their possible ecological niche.

it is not clear how the common genotypic characteristics of cjd, identified in this study, relate to the observed clinical characteristics such as bacteremia  <cit> . nevertheless, the absence of the virulence related genes, cdta and cdtb may play a role. it is also possible that there are unidentified virulence-related genes present in the cjd strains that are absent from cjj strains. the current cgi analysis measures the gene content of the cjd strains relative to the nctc  <dig> and rm <dig> genes present on the microarray; thus, cjd-specific genes would not be detected by the cgi analysis. the current genomic sequencing project of cjd strain  <dig>  by j. craig venter institute  may identify such unique cjd genes  <cit> . it is also possible that many of the differences between the two subspecies are a result of more subtle differences. these subtle differences could be bp changes that result in proteins with a different topology or substrate specificity or bp changes that affect gene regulation or protein expression) that would not be detected using an amplicon-based dna microarray with cgi analysis but would be observed from the sequence data. additional, comparative genomic analysis will be possible once the sequence is available.
