BACKGROUND
t-cell activation is central to the adaptive immune response. the first step in t-cell activation is immunological synapse  formation at the interface of a t cell and an antigen-presenting cell  during antigen recognition. the is is a multi-molecular assembled of receptors and adhesion molecules, consisting of a central cluster of t-cell receptors  that form the central supramolecular activation cluster  and a surrounding ring of adhesion molecules   <cit> . during synapse formation, molecular re-organisation of plasma membrane proteins occurs in concert with a complex and dramatic morphological change in the cell, which is primarily driven by active cytoskeletal processes, such as actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and microtubule-organising centre  reorientation . the cytoskeleton rearrangements result in an altered morphology, including cell polarisation, which is essential for t-cell activation. however, not all antigen-specific t cells are sufficiently activated by contact with an apc  <cit> , so the factors affecting the morphological changes in and activation of t cells have attracted much attention.

the morphology of t cell has been reported to change from spherical to elongated and/or flattened in a dynamic manner during is formation . the elongated morphology is believed to be a characteristic of a mobile t cell which is scanning or spreading toward apcs, whereas the flattened t cell is immobile and forms stable contact with the apc  <cit> . the process of a t cell encountering an antigen-presenting b cell lasts >20 min and consists of three distinct stages: contact, recognition, and stabilisation  <cit> . the contact phase lasts from 20 s to several minutes and consists of t-cell probing of and contact with the b cell prior to any change in i. the recognition phase lasts 1–3 min and is the most dynamic stage of the interaction, coupled with a i increase. the third phase  occurs after i relaxes from the peak level and is morphologically characterised by partial retraction and subsequent rounding of the t cell  <cit> . the dendritic cell  is the most powerful apc and has a strong ability to activate t cells. the type of synapse formed between a t cell and a dc is different from that between a t cell and a b cell  <cit> , which may reflect different cytoskeleton rearrangements and morphological changes in a t cell in contact with a dc. however, the morphological change of t cell during contact with dc is not very clear.

filamentous actin  network plays a central role in is formation, morphological change and tcr signalling  <cit> . treatment of t cells with actin depolymerising agents leads to loss of ca2+ mobilization and downstream transcriptional activation  <cit> . a necessary step for the activation of t cells following tcr engagement is the stimulation of ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane  <cit> . tcr activation causes a series of signalling molecules to accumulate in the is, such as zeta-chain-associated protein kinase  <dig> , linker of activated t cells  and phospholipase c-γ . the activity of plc-γ generates inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate, which releases ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum  and promotes activation of the ca2+ release-activated ca2+  channels encoded by the orai proteins in the plasma membrane  <cit> . the ca2+ influx through the crac/orai channels triggers the translocation of mitochondria towards the plasma membrane or is, and these mitochondria in turn maintain calcium channel activity and thereby allow more ca2+ influx to induce global cytosolic ca2+ signalling  <cit> . when mitochondrial accumulation at the is is prevented, ca2+ accumulates in a microdomain close to the crac/orai channels, leading to inactivation of the channels and efficient ca2+ clearance by plasma membrane ca2+ atpases . therefore, the global cytosolic ca2+ concentration becomes low  <cit> . cytoskeletal networks have been reported to affect intracellular ca2+ signalling by controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of ca2+ sources and sinks and by modulating tcr-dependent ca2+ signals, which are required for an appropriate t-cell response  <cit> .

in our study, we imaged the diversity of morphological changes in antigen-specific t cells during contact with dcs. we found that a relatively round and flattened t-cell shape was correlated with a strong and sustained ca2+ response in the t cell, whereas an mobility and elongated-flattened t-cell shape was correlated with a limited ca2+ response. furthermore, morphological changes modulated t-cell activation by the accumulation of f-actin which controls the distribution of calcium microdomains. the accumulation of f-actin in the is plays an important role in t-cell activation.

dc maturation and cd4+ t cell-dc contact
for icam-1-egfp/dc <dig>  cell maturation, ifn-γ  was added into the medium for overnight incubation. then lps  was added for one hour incubation  <cit> . ova  was used to pulse the dc cell line for 2-h. ot-ii cd4+ t cells labelled with alexa fluor 647-conjugated h <dig> antibody were added to matured dc  for live cell imaging. for some experiments, t cells were pre-incubated at 37 °c with 1 μm,  <dig>  μm, 5 μm or 10 μm cytochalasin d for 30 min, or 2 μm nocodazole for 16 h. those t cells were washed by pbs buffer, and then added to ova-pulsed dcs. for tg stimulation, tg  was used to stimulate t cells for 1 min to image or add to ova-pulsed dcs.

confocal microscopy
images were taken with a confocal microscope  equipped with an apo oil immersion objective lens . to quantify redistribution of molecules at the contact site, t-dc doublets were chosen from bright-field images and evaluated by the fluorescence image stacks. image stacks consisted of 6– <dig> sections with 1 μm per step at z axis. time-lapse scanning was used for live cell imaging for 30–60 min with 512 × 512 pixels per frame and  <dig> or 10 s as the interval.

ca2+ imaging
for ca2+ imaging, ot-ii cd4+ t cells were incubated with h57-fab-tcrαβ-alexa fluor  <dig> for 30 min at 4 °c, washed twice, then labelled with 10 μm calcium crimson™ in 1 ml calcium free pbs for 60 min at 25 °c. then the cells were washed two times, and were added to ova-pused icam-1-egfp/dc <dig> . afterwards, the cells were maintained throughout the experiment in mammalian ringer solution containing :  <dig> nacl,  <dig>  kcl,  <dig> cacl <dig>   <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> hepes , supplemented with 11 mm glucose. calibration was performed by measuring fluorescence intensities in the absence of calcium  or the calcium-saturated solution , and applying the equation of takahashi et al.  <cit>  fmin was established at 1 mm egta with calcium-free solution. fmax was established at 1 mm ionomycin with 10 mm ca2+. ca2+ images were taken every 5–20 min after adding t cells to the dcs. the scans were made at 10-s or 40-s intervals to determine whether calcium concentration rose in the t cells after contacting dcs. then z-planes scanning were used to determine the synapse structure.

immunofluorescence staining
for zap- <dig> and other intracellular molecule staining, after the t cells had contacted dcs for  <dig> mins, all the cells were fixed in pbs/4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by pbs/ <dig>  m glycine incubation for 3 min, as reported previously  <cit> . cells were permeabilized with pbs/ <dig>  % triton x- <dig> for 20 min, and then blocked with pbs/2 % bsa buffer for 20 min. afterwards, the cells were stained with a 1: <dig> dilution of anti-zap- <dig> antibody for 60 min. after being washed three times, the secondary antibody was diluted 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> and incubated with cells for 30 min. the images of cells were observed with a confocal microscope. for f-actin staining or mitochondrial labeling, the antibody of f-actin or mitotracker was used as previously reported  <cit> .

imaging analysis
the images were analysed with the leica application suite advanced fluorescence software . segmentation, rendering, area, spot tracking and maximum intensity projection were used for data visualization analysis. utilizing these tools, 3d intercellular contacts could be visualized from multiple angles. only t-dc pairs whose contact orientation was proper for x-y plane projection were taken into consideration for further analysis.

a quantitative estimation of morphological change was obtained by calculating the shape index: shape index = p2/4πs  <cit> . the p and s are the perimeter and the area of the cross section of a cell  respectively. these values were calculated from a semiautomatic definition of the outline of the cell, obtained with imaris software. when the planar projection of a cell  is a circle, the shape index is approximately  <dig>  any departure from a circle gives a shape index >  <dig>  reflecting the cell was elongated  <cit> . we defined a cell as a round cell if the shape index was within  <dig> - <dig> , and defined a cell as an elongated cell if the shape index was above  <dig> .

the flattened morphology change was measured by the contrast change between the edges and the middle part along a line  according to a previous report  <cit> . briefly, the flattening of a cell correlated with a reduction of the contrast between the edge  and the middle part  of the cell when analysed by the gray value of the bright field  image. then we defined a cell which became elongated and flattened as an elongated-flattened cell and define a cell which only became flattened as a round-flattened cell.

the contact area was assumed to form a spherical cap with a solid angle of 2α on the t cell. it is estimated by the equation c = 2πr <dig>   <cit> , where c is the contact area while α is half of the solid angle for the contact cap.fig.  <dig> morphological changes in t cells following is formation. a

data analysis
data analysis was performed with graphpad prism  <dig> . for all statistics, two-tailed student’s t-test and one-way anova were applied to compare two normal distribution datasets. mann–whitney u test was used to compare two nonparametric datasets. significance levels and symbols employed were p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
two different types of morphological changes in cd4+ t cells were analysed during is formation
to investigate the morphological changes in cd4+ t cells during is formation, we sorted splenic cd4+ t cells from ot-ii transgenic mice and labelled the tcr clusters. additionally, icam-1-egfp was transfected into the dc <dig>  cell line to show the is structure. after the cd4+ t cells were placed in contact with ova-pulsed dcs, the synapse structure was measured using confocal microscopy. we found that only those cd4+ t cells forming a stable synapse became flattened . using a protocol from a previous report  <cit> , the flattening was measured based on the contrast change between the edges and the middle part along a line. a naive t cell is spherical in shape before it makes contact with an apc. after the t cell made contact with a dc, the t cell changed to a flattened morphology, with the contrast between the edges and the middle part reduced to approximately  <dig>  microscopy, fig. 1a-b right panel). however, those cd4+ t cells that interacted with dcs transiently or that scanned dcs without forming a synapse did not become flattened . these findings indicated that the flattened shape was correlated with is formation.

for the cd4+ t cells that interacted with dcs, 15 % of t cells changed from spherical to elongated and flattened in shape . neither immobility nor round shape was observed among these t cells during is formation . in contrast, 52 % of the cd4+ t cells in contact with dcs became flattened and remained round during is formation . the shape index of the round-flattened t cells slightly fluctuated around  <dig> during the process of t cell-dc contact. during this process, certain t cells extended their pseudopodia to make contact with dcs in several frames . other t cells were scanning t cells and did not become flattened during contact with dcs . the duration of the elongated-flattened and round-flattened cd4+ t cells’ contact with dcs was more than 1 h, indicating that both morphological changes in the cd4+ t cells allowed the formation of a stable synapse with dcs.

in the absence of antigen, the percentage of t cell-dc contact decreased significantly. nearly no stable t cell-dc contact was found. neither the round-flattened nor the elongated-flattened change was observed among the cd4+ t cells. as the antigen concentration increased, the number of elongated-flattened and round-flattened t cells increased, whereas the ratio of round-flattened t cells to elongated-flattened t cells among all t cell-dc conjugates was not changed .

the elongated-flattened morphological change correlated with ineffective t-cell activation, whereas the round-flattened morphological change correlated with effective t-cell activation
previous reports showed that only 13 % and 60 % of antigen-specific t cells could be activated by b cells and dcs, respectively  <cit> . to investigate whether the distinct morphologies might induce different t-cell activation states, we dynamically measured the morphological changes and calcium signals after an ot-ii cd4+ t cell came into contact with an ova-pulsed dc. we found that the trigger of ca2+ signal was correlated with the change to the flattened shape of t cells. the elongated-flattened morphology of the cd4+ t cells correlated with low-level ca2+ signals. a ca2+ signal was released in an elongated-flattened cd4+ t cell during contact with a dc . before the ot-ii cd4+ t cell made contact with the dc, its shape index slightly fluctuated around  <dig>  the t cell then made contact with the dc, and its shape index changed, resulting in dramatic elongation during the contact phase . tcrs began to move into the centre of the cell-cell contact . in contrast with t cell recognition of a b cell  <cit> , this t cell needed a long time to recognise the dc . the t cell became flattened at 1040 s, after which the ca2+ signal was triggered. the peak of the ca2+ signal was  <dig> nm. in this phase, tcrs and icam- <dig> accumulated to form the synapse . after the recognition phase, the ca2+ response decreased .fig.  <dig> morphological changes correlated with sustained ca2+ signals in cd4+ t cells. a shape index changes and ca2+ signals in a cd4+ t cell whose morphology changed to elongated-flattened . phases i, ii, and iii refer to contact, recognition, and interaction, respectively. images of the morphology and ca2+ signals of the elongated-flattened t cell in the three phases are shown in the left panel at the bottom. the contrast between the edges and the middle of the cell changed at  <dig> s and  <dig> s . b shape index changes and ca2+ signals in a cd4+ t cell whose morphology changed to flattened  during the three phases. images of the morphology and ca2+ signals of the round-flattened t cell in the three phases are shown in the left panel at the bottom. the contrast between the edges and the middle part of the cell changed at  <dig> s and  <dig> s . the dotted white line depicts the contact boundary between the ot-ii cd4+ t cells and the dcs. c shape index changes and ca2+ signals in a single resting cd4+ t cell. the contrast between the edges and the middle of the cell changed at  <dig> s .  ca2+ signalling was observed every  <dig> s or  <dig> s. the calcium signal intensity was pseudo-colored with hues ranging from blue  to red . icam- <dig> was labelled to be green, tcr was labelled be red. before is formation, tcr was uniformed on the surface of t cell. after is formation, tcr and icam- <dig> were accumulated into the is of dc-t. d average ca2+ responses in cd4+ t cells whose morphology changed to round-flattened  or elongated-flattened . the average ca2+ response in the resting cd4+ t cells was 57± <dig> nm . scale bar =  <dig> μm



in contrast to the elongated-flattened morphological change, the round-flattened change in the cd4+ t cells correlated with a high level of ca2+ signalling. a ca2+ signal was released in a round-flattened cd4+ t cell during contact with a dc . the t cell made contact with the dc at 200 s and had no obvious morphological change. in the recognition phase , the shape index of the round-flattened t cell fluctuated in the range of  <dig> - <dig> . the t cell became flattened at 300 s, and a ca2+ signal was released at that moment . the ca2+ signal was triggered at 600 s and sustained for at least 10 min. after the recognition phase, the shape index was approximately  <dig>  and the ca2+ response was sustained at a high level. the recognition phase of round-flattened t cell-dc contact was shorter than that of an elongated-flattened t cell. the mean peak of ca2+ responses in the elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells were significantly lower than that in the round-flattened cd4+ t cells . the ca2+ signals were not induced in resting or scanning cd4+ t cells . these results indicated that different morphological changes correlated with different t-cell activation states.

to further investigate the correlation between the morphological changes and t-cell activation, tcr signalling pathway molecules were detected. although tcrs accumulated in the is in both types of morphologically changed cd4+ t cells, the mean fluorescence intensity  of the tcrs in the is of the elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells was lower than that in the is of the round-flattened cd4+ t cells . furthermore, zap- <dig>  a parameter that reflects the tcr’s downstream signal, was measured in the is of elongated and/or flattened cd4+ t cells. zap- <dig> had a limited or no tendency to accumulate in the is of elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells and did not co-localise with the tcr cluster. however, zap- <dig> was obviously recruited into and accumulated in the is of round-flattened cd4+ t cells and co-localised with tcrs . the mfi of zap- <dig> in the is of the elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells was lower than that in the is of the round-flattened cd4+ t cells . plc-γ <dig> and pkc-θ, the downstream signalling molecules of zap- <dig>  did not co-localise with the tcr cluster in the is of the elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells . in contrast, both of these molecules were present in the is and co-localised with tcrs in the round-flattened cd4+ t cells. in the elongated-flattened t cells, zap- <dig> did not co-localise with tcrs, leading to impairment of zap- <dig> activation, which blocked downstream signalling.fig.  <dig> morphological changes correlated with the localisation of tcr signalling molecules in the is. a-d

taken together, elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells may lose the ability to be activated due to a defect in tcr signalling molecule accumulation and may be induced to produce a low-level ca2+ response, whereas round-flattened cd4+ t cells can be activated.

the amount of f-actin accumulating in is differed in different morphological change of cd4+ t cell
to investigate the reason why the different morphologies of the t cells induced different t-cell activation states, we first studied the factors affecting t-cell morphological changes. actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and mtoc reorientation were both involved in the t-cell morphological changes and were evoked by the tcr-mediated increase in intracellular ca2+ signalling  <cit> . both events provided the basis for structural remodelling and intracellular signal transduction in t cells  <cit> . thus, we measured the localisation of f-actin and microtubules in t cells after is formation. in our study, f-actin accumulated in the is of the elongated-flattened t cells and the round-flattened t cells . however, f-actin did not accumulate in the scanning t cells, which did not become flattened and did not form an is with dcs . although the fluorescence intensities of the total f-actin in the elongated-flattened t cells and the round-flattened t cells were not significantly different , the fluorescence intensity of f-actin in the is of the elongated-flattened t cells was lower than that in the is of the round-flattened t cells . moreover, the area of accumulation of f-actin in the is of the elongated-flattened t cells was significantly smaller than that in the is of the round-flattened t cells, consistent with the results showing that the contact area between the elongated-flattened t cells and dcs was smaller than that between the round-flattened t cells and dcs . these findings indicated that less f-actin accumulated in the is of elongated-flattened t cells than in the is of round-flattened t cells.fig.  <dig> the morphological changes in cd4+ t cells were dependent on the f-actin cytoskeleton. a the accumulation of f-actin  in an elongated-flattened cd4+ t cell  or a round-flattened cd4+ t cell  after is formation. the distribution of f-actin in a cd4+ t cell after it made contact with an ova323-339-pulsed dc in the presence of cytochalasin d is also depicted. tcr  and icam- <dig>  were labelled to show the is formation. the dotted white line depicts the contact boundary between the cd4+ t cells and the dcs. scale bar =  <dig> μm. b the mfis of f-actin in the is of the round-flattened t cells and the elongated-flattened t cells , ***p< <dig>  . c comparison of the contact area of t cell-dc contact based on the area of accumulation of f-actin in the is , ***p< <dig>  . d the percentage of elongated and/or flattened cd4+ t cells was analysed after t cells made contact with dcs with cytochalasin d, nocodazole, tg, or cytochalasin d and tg treatment . e the percentage of elongated and/or flattened cd4+ t cells after is formation with  <dig> μm,  <dig>  μm,  <dig> μm, or  <dig> μm cytochalasin d treatment 



treated with cytochalasin d, an inhibitor of f-actin polymerisation, f-actin could not accumulate in the is formed by t cell-dc contact . not only the percentage of cd4+ t cell-dc contact was reduced but also the percentages of elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells and round-flattened cd4+ t cells decreased significantly . as the dose of cytochalasin d increased, both the percentage of elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells and the percentage of round-flattened cd4+ t cells decreased. treatment with 5 μm cytochalasin d disrupted the elongated-flattened morphology completely . these results indicated that f-actin played an important role in the formation of cell-cell contact and in morphological change of t cells. however, microtubules accumulated in the is in 10 % of the elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells and in 30 % of the round-flattened cd4+ t cells . after treatment with nocodazole, a microtubule inhibitor, the morphology of cd4+ t cells after t cell-dc contact did not change . microtubule was not an essential factor in the morphological changes of t cell during contact with dc.

because the morphological changes in t cells were accompanied by a ca2+ response during is formation, we investigated whether intracellular ca2+ signalling could influence t-cell morphological changes. the changes in t-cell morphology were measured after treatment with thapsigargin , an inhibitor of the sarco-endoplasmic ca2+ atpase that depletes ca2+ stores completely and irreversibly  <cit> , thereby leading to maximal activation of the crac channels and maximal ca2+ release from the er  <cit> . when t cells were treated with tg, the morphology of the cells remained round. when t cells were pre-treated with tg and then made contact with dcs, the percentages of t cells that became elongated-flattened and round-flattened were similar to those in the absence of tg treatment . furthermore, we blocked f-actin polymerisation in t cells with cytochalasin d  to abrogate the morphological changes, pre-stimulated the t cells with tg, and then added those t cells to ova-pulsed dcs. neither elongated-flattened nor round-flattened t cells were observed . these findings indicated that intracellular ca2+ signal from ca2+ stores could not affect the morphology and that the morphological changes required f-actin.

the accumulation of f-actin in the is contributes to the calcium influx in cd4+ t cells
to further analyse whether f-actin participates in t-cell activation, we measured the calcium response after disrupting f-actin. consistent with previous reports  <cit> , in the presence of cytochalasin d , the mean peak ca2+ signal and the fluctuation of the ca2+ signal in cd4+ t cells decreased significantly . the mean peak ca2+ signal decreased significantly not only in the round-flattened t cells but also in the elongated-flattened t cells after cytochalasin d treatment . these results indicated that f-actin modulated the ca2+ response in cd4+ t cells.fig.  <dig> different morphological changes in cd4+ t cells modulated ca2+ signalling in an f-actin-dependent manner. a ca2+ response in a cd4+ t cell after it made contact with a dc pulsed with ova323- <dig> in the presence or absence of cytochalasin d. b average ca2+ responses were measured in cd4+ t cells following is formation in the presence of cytochalasin d, nocodazole, tg or cytochalasin d and tg , ***p< <dig>  . c average ca2+ responses were measured in elongated and/or flattened cd4+ t cells after they made contact with dcs in the presence of cytochalasin d or tg treatment , **p< <dig> , ***p< <dig>  . d ca2+ response in a cd4+ t cell with tg stimulation and in a cd4+ t cell making contact with a dc after tg pre-treatment. e ca2+ response in a cd4+ t cell with cytochalasin d and tg treatment and in a cd4+ t cell that made contact with a dc after cytochalasin d and tg pre-treatment. ca2+ signalling was noted every  <dig> s



furthermore, cd4+ t cells were pre-treated with tg and were then co-incubated with ova-pulsed dcs. there was a greater increase of ca2+ signals in the cd4+ t cells after is formation , despite maximal depletion of the ca2+ stores in the t cells before dc contact. the round-flattened t cells exhibited greater ca2+ signal induction than the elongated-flattened t cells did after is formation . however, with cytochalasin d pre-incubation, treatment with tg, and then contact with ova-pulsed dcs, cd4+ t cells did not undergo any further ca2+ signal elevation . under these conditions, there was no difference in the ca2+ response between the round-flattened t cells and the elongated-flattened t cells . the results indicated that f-actin participated in the ca2+ influx in the t cells.

f-actin modulated the ca2+influx by controlling the distribution of calcium microdomains
there have been reports that ca2+ response is correlated with the location of calcium microdomains and the movement of f-actin  <cit> . to analyse how f-actin modulates the ca2+ response in t cells, we compared the distributions of calcium microdomains in the is between the different t-cell morphologies. orai <dig> is a key member of the crac channel protein family in cd4+ t cells. in our experiments, in  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of the round-flattened cd4+ t cells, orai <dig> localised in the synapse or puncta . in 75 ±  <dig>  % of the elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells, orai <dig> was away from the is . the fluorescence intensity of orai <dig> in the is of the elongated-flattened cd4+ t cells was lower than that in the is of the flattened cd4+ t cells .fig.  <dig> f-actin cytoskeleton-dependent morphological changes modulate ca2+ signals by controlling the localisation of calcium microdomains. a the localisation of orai <dig> in an elongated and/or flattened cd4+ t cell or a cd4+ t cell with cytochalasin d treatment. b left column: the percentage of cd4+ t cells with orai <dig> localisation in the is. right column: the mfi of orai <dig> in the is , **p< <dig> , ***p< <dig>  . c the localisation of pmca in an elongated and/or flattened cd4+ t cell or a cd4+ t cell with cytochalasin d treatment. in a and c, tcr  and icam- <dig>  are labelled to show the is formation. the dotted white line depicts the contact boundary between the cd4+ t cells and the dcs. scale bar =  <dig> μm.  left column: the percentage of cd4+ t cells with pmca localisation in the is. right column: the mfi of pmca in the is , ***p< <dig>

with cytochalasin d treatment, there was no accumulation of orai <dig> or pmca in the synapses of the t cells . the fluorescence intensities of orai <dig> and pmca in the is decreased significantly . moreover, with cytochalasin d treatment, mitochondria were not present in the synapses of cd4+ t cells . the fluorescence intensity of the mitochondria in the is decreased significantly . these data indicated that f-actin modulated the distribution of calcium microdomains to be localised in or near the is. the different distributions of calcium microdomains between elongated-flattened t cells and round-flattened t cells indicated that the different ca2+ signals between the two t-cell morphologies may be modulated by the amount of f-actin accumulation in the is.

discussion
t-cell polarisation accompanied by altered morphology is important for t-cell activation  <cit> . spherical t cells have been reported to become elongated and/or flattened after contact with an apc  <cit> . in contrast to contact with b cells, t cells contact with dcs led to diverse t-cell morphological changes in our experiments. especially, the round-flattened shape change was mostly observed in t cell during contact with dc. only t cells that became flattened, undergoing either round-flattened or elongated-flattened morphological changes, formed an is with dcs. there are three characteristics that differ between the round-flattened morphology and the elongated-flattened morphology. first, the recognition phase of the round-flattened t cell is shorter than that of the elongated-flattened t cell. second, the range of the shape index of round-flattened t cell is narrower than that of the elongated-flattened t cell . third, the contact areas formed by round-flattened t cell-dc contact are larger than those formed by elongated-flattened t cell-dc contact. these phenomena indicated that cytoskeletal polymerisation was different between these two t-cell shapes, which may lead to different t-cell activation states.

the relationship between morphological changes and t-cell activation has attracted much attention, but the relationship between morphological changes and the activation of naive t cells in contact with dcs is rarely described. the diversity of t-cell morphological changes during t cell-dc contact may lead to diverse t-cell activation states. here, we found that only flattening of a t cell, including elongated-flattened morphology and round-flattened morphology, correlated with ca2+ release in the t cell. the vast majority of t cells became round-flattened when they made contact with dcs, whereas minority became elongated-flattened. only the round-flattened t cells exhibited a high-level ca2+ response and the accumulation of activated tcr signalling molecules in the is. in contrast, the elongated-flattened t cells exhibited a low-level ca2+ response and did not accumulate tcr signalling molecules in the is. a sustained high level of ca2+ signalling can sufficiently induce t-cell activation, whereas a low level of ca2+ signalling for a long period of time may induce t-cell tolerance  <cit> . the round-flattened t cells may be activated efficiently, whereas the elongated-flattened t cells may fail to be activated. although t-cell polarisation is helpful for t-cell activation, excessive tension may be not efficient for t-cell activation. in addition, round-flattened shape of t cell was different from t cell contacted b cell but occupied the major proportion of t cell during contact with dc, and was activated efficiently. these results may explain why dcs can activate more antigen-specific t cells than b cells in a short period of time. in our observation, we found that elongated-flattened change and round-flattened change of t cell occurred before is formation  and ca2+ release . due to is formation controlled t-cell activation  <cit> , morphological change before is formation is an initial factor for t-cell activation. for the t cell without elongated-flattened or round-flattened shape change, t cell can not be activated . when disrupting the morphology of t cells with cytochalasin d, t-cell activation was decreased . thus the morphological changes of t cell modulate t-cell activation. to investigate whether different t cell activation status determines their morphology changes during dc activation, we obsevered the morphology of t cell and found that it was changed after t cell was activated. the elongated-flattened t cell changed to round-flattened after is formation for ten minutes  while the round-flattened t cell did not. it indicated that t-cell activation might affect the morphological change of t cell in return. in this manuscript, we focus on how the morphological change modulates t-cell activation. the investigation how t-cell activation affects the morphological change of t cell would be our further study.

furthermore, we have shown that f-actin plays an important role in the process of morphological changes modulating t-cell activation. moreover, greater accumulation of f-actin in the is is better for t-cell activation. previously, f-actin was shown to play at least three important roles in antigen recognition:  forming the is by organising distinct supramolecular activation clusters through actin cytoskeleton rearrangements  <cit> ;  involving signalling complexes that are dependent on a scaffold of actin filaments ; and  modulating ca2+ influx by controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of ca2+ sources and sinks  <cit> . in our experiments, we found that the intensity of f-actin accumulation in the is correlates with the strength of t-cell activation. in round-flattened t cells, more f-actin accumulation in the is is better for stable synapse formation and organisation of the supermolecular activation clusters involving zap- <dig>  plc-γ, pkc-θ, which further activate the tcr signalling pathway to trigger a calcium response. a large amount of f-actin is polarised to the is to bring more mitochondria to localise into the is. previous reports showed the localisation of mitochondria in the is prevent ca2+-dependent channel inactivation and sustain the activity of the crac channels for a long period to allow a prolonged ca2+ influx, which enhances ca2+-dependent t-cell activation and subsequent proliferation  <cit> . therefore, a large amount of f-actin in is will be of great benefit to t-cell activation by bringing more mitochondria close to the is. however, in elongated-flattened t cells, less accumulation of f-actin reduces its ability to bring a large proportion of the mitochondria close to the is. in case mitochondrial accumulation at the is is prevented, ca2+ accumulates in a microdomain close to the crac/orai channels, which leads to inactivation of the channels and efficient ca2+ clearance by pmca  <cit> . these events result in a sustained low ca2+ signal in elongated-flattened t cells, which is consistent with a report by ariel quintana  <cit> . in addition, tg treatment can lead to maximal activation of crac channels, but had no impact on the tcr signaling molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, morphological change and the localization of orai <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the activation of crac channels could not affect morphological change. after is formation, tcr signaling molecules, cytoskeletal proteins and orai <dig> were activated. the localization of orai <dig> in crac channels in is were correlated with different morphological t cells. due to cytoskeletal protein was reported to affect the localization of orai <dig> in is  <cit> . the cytoskeletal proteins affected morphological change of t cells, while orai <dig> in crac did not. therefore, in t cells with different morphologies, different t-cell activation states may be attributable to the ability of f-actin to accumulate in the is, which leads to different distributions of calcium microdomains and levels of ca2+ release.

in addition, antigen dose could not affect the ratio of elongated-flattened t cells to round-flattened t cells but decreased the numbers of elongated-flattened t cells and round-flattened t cells. it indicated elongated or flattened shape change is not correlated with antigen dose. the reason why elongated-flattened morphology is associated with low activation of t cells whereas the round-flattened morphology is associated with effective t cell activation may be the different expressions of membrane surface molecules on these two types of t cells. some membrane surface molecules are associated with f-actin that affect morphological change. these molecules may also be associated with t-cell activation. for example, ctla- <dig> or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may participate in morphological change and t-cell activation . in addition, some adhesion molecules may participate in morphological change and t-cell activation. for example, lfa- <dig> is reported to accumulate into t-dc contact before tcr accumulation and affect the movement of f-actin that is associated with morphological change  <cit> . moreover, lfa- <dig> is an important molecule for is formation and t-cell activation. it is worthy to investigate which molecules regulate morphological change and the activation of t cell. the elongated morphological change in t cells is reported to be mediated by ctla- <dig>  <cit>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . both of these molecules are dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, vav- <dig>  cdc <dig>  myosin light chain kinase, src-family kinases, and phospholipase c  <cit>  to further affect f-actin polymerisation. elongated t cells may be a subset that express specific adhesion molecules to mediate cell-cell contact, f-actin polymerisation and higher-order f-actin bundling  <cit> . therefore, the different morphological change may occurr in two different subsets of cd4+ t cells. what adhesion molecules are essential for shape changes and what the function of such a cd4+ t cell subset with special adhesion molecules will be the subjects of our future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we found that f-actin accumulation in the is participates in the processes of t-cell morphological changes and activation and modulates ca2+ influx by controlling the distribution of calcium microdomains. not all antigen-specific t cells are activated to release a high level of calcium signal; only round-flattened t cells accumulate a large amount of f-actin in the is and exhibit a high-level ca2+ response. other t cells, which become elongated-flattened, exhibit a low-level calcium response. loss of the ability of f-actin to accumulate in the is may lead to hyporesponsiveness among elongated-flattened t cells, which may play a regulatory role in t-cell activation. the mechanism and the function of such hyporesponsive t cells should be studied further.
