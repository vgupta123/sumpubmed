BACKGROUND
quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  has become a method of choice for gene expression studies in clinical samples, especially for low copy targets of interest and for samples of limited size  <cit> . in comparison to microarrays  <cit> , qrt-pcr benefits from broad dynamic range, sensitivity, and enables accurate quantification  <cit> .

however, to precisely quantify changes in expression level of target genes by qrt-pcr, one must apply normalisation for heterogeneity in clinical samples and also for variability introduced during rna extraction and cdna synthesis  <cit> . besides normalisation to sample size and total rna, normalisation using endogenous reference genes represents relevant approach  <cit> . reference genes should ideally be constitutively expressed by all cell types and should not be affected by disease and experimental procedure. to date, a universal reference gene has not been identified yet. housekeeping genes  are most commonly used reference genes  <cit> . although hkgs are expressed by any cell, their expression varies among different cell types/organs  <cit> . use of hkgs as reference genes for a particular sample type should be, therefore, validated.

so far, only few reference genes have been validated for cells from respiratory compartment; specifically gnb2l <dig> was validated for bronchoalveolar macrophages in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit>  and gapdh  for non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> . the majority of studies published on qrt-pcr in lung setting uses a general approach of normalisation against gapdh or actb   <cit> . however, these "traditional" reference genes have been already found unsuitable for normalising of mrna levels in asthmatic airways  <cit>  and also for expression studies employing bronchoalveolar macrophages  <cit> .

in order to identify suitable reference genes for qrt-pcr normalisation in the setting of bronchoalveolar compartment, our aim, therefore, was to identify hkgs with the most stable mrna expression in bronchoalveolar  cells. our choice of candidate hkgs was based on 1) their common use in previous qrt-pcr experiments , 2) stable expression in different human tissues in microarray experiments   <cit> , and 3) stable expression in bronchoalveolar macrophages and peripheral neutrophils   <cit> . to account for variations of bal cellular profile in different respiratory diseases, we studied stability of hkgs mrna expression in seventy-one subjects across a spectrum of lung pathologies. besides bal cellular profile and type of lung pathology, four variables were investigated for their possible influence on mrna expression of studied hkgs; these were: smoking, gender, treatment, and age. further, mrna expression stability of all ten hkgs was validated in the second, independent bal cohort consisting of seventeen control subjects and sixty-three sarcoidosis patients with special emphasis on patient subgroups. finally, by investigation of mrna expression of two cytokines known associated with sarcoidosis, infg  and ccl2/mcp- <dig>  we provided practical evidence, that normalisation with validated reference genes in clinical samples is absolute prerequisite for obtaining clinically unbiased valid information from qrt-pcr.

methods
subjects
bal was performed according a standard procedure  <cit>  in  <dig> caucasian subjects  with lung diseases diagnosed between  <dig> and  <dig> in one referral centre in the czech republic . the diagnoses were in compliance with the criteria from the international statements/standards of these diseases:  <dig> patients with interstitial lung diseases ,  <dig> cancer patients and  <dig> copd patients. for clinical and laboratory characteristics of studied subjects see table e <dig> in the additional file  <dig> 

the subgroups based on gender , smoking status , treatment before bal , age , and groups with normal /pathological  differential bal cell counts were also analyzed. the reference values for bal cell counts  were based on our own laboratory values and correspond to meyer  <cit> . the subgroups according bal cell composition were as follows:  <dig> n/ <dig> p macrophage-,  <dig> n/ <dig> p lymphocyte-,  <dig> n/ <dig> p neutrophil- and  <dig> n/ <dig> p eosinophil-counts.

the second cohort, used for validation of mrna expression stability of studied hkgs, consisted of  <dig> subjects:  <dig> patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and  <dig> control subjects. the control group consisted of subjects  undergoing bal within medical examination for "non-inflammatory condition" e.g. psychogenic cough. all had normal bal fluid cytology, immunology, and microbiology & cd4+/cd8+ ratio. for clinical and laboratory characteristics of studied subjects from the second cohort see table e <dig> in the additional file  <dig>  none of the patients in the second cohort received corticosteroid therapy before bal. the subgroups in the second cohort were based on gender , smoking status , and presence of lung disease . further subgroups were formed within the sarcoidosis patient group: based on the presence/absence of löfgren's syndrome  , involvement of parenchyma , involvement of other organs than lung  and groups with normal /pathological  differential bal cell counts. the subgroups according bal cell composition were as follows:  <dig> n/ <dig> p macrophage-,  <dig> n/ <dig> p lymphocyte-,  <dig> n/ <dig> p neutrophil- and  <dig> n/ <dig> p eosinophil-counts.

the study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty palacky university & faculty hospital olomouc. all subjects signed informed consent about usage of an aliquot of bal sample, taken primarily for diagnostic purposes, also for the research purposes of this study.

bal sample processing
bal cells  were separated from the bal fluid and washed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, bal samples were filtered through one gauze layer followed by separation of bal cells by centrifugation . the cells were washed twice with  <dig> ml ice-cold pbs-depc, counted and resolved in  <dig> μl pbs-depc. after immediate addition of rnalater , the cells were stored at 4°c overnight and then at -20°c until use. the time between bal procedure and processing of sample did not exceeded  <dig> hours.

total rna isolation and quality assessment, reverse transcription
the cells stored in rnalater were recovered by centrifugation  after 1: <dig> dilution with ice-cold pbs-depc as recommended by the manufacturer. total rna was isolated using mirvana mirna kit  and genomic dna was eliminated by turbodnafree kit  according to the manufacturer's recommendation. the quantity and quality of rna samples were assessed by  <dig> bioanalyzer  using rna  <dig> nano assays.

reverse transcription  was performed with reverse-it rtase blend using anchored dt primers  at 47°c for  <dig> min in triplicates and then combined. all cdna samples were diluted to  <dig> ng input total rna/μl and stored in aliquots at -20°c until use.

gene expression measurements by qrt-pcr
fluorescently labelled locked nucleic acid probes  and the primers  for investigated genes  were selected using probefinder assay design tool  . pcr reaction mixes were prepared as follows: equal amount of cdna  for each individual gene was added to  <dig> μl pcr-mix . the final concentrations were  <dig> nm each sense and antisense primers,  <dig> nm lna probe,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> μm each dntps,  <dig> u thermo-start taq polymerase, 1× thermo-start buffer . after initial denaturation ,  <dig> cycles amplification  were performed on rotorgene  <dig> system .

statistical analysis
descriptive statistics, f-test for ctt variance equality, kolmogorov-smirnov test for normality of log-transformed relative expression values were calculated by software spss  <dig>  . log-transformed relative expression values for infg and ccl <dig> were used for statistical calculations by student's t-test, one-way anova. p <  <dig>  was considered significant. equivalence test  <cit> , statistical applets bestkeeper  <cit> , genorm  <cit>  and normfinder  <cit>  were used for the analysis of gene expression stability. normalisation factors  for genes and gene pairs were calculated according to vandesompele et al  <cit> . for more details on statistical approaches and calculation of normalisation factor see the additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
quality of rna isolated from bal samples
all investigated rna samples were of good quality, mean rin  values  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . among all samples, ratios 28s:18s varied between  <dig> – <dig>  with no visible degradation products .

amplification efficiency and reproducibility of qrt-pcr with fluorescently labelled lna-probes
in order to determine the amplification efficiency for all studied genes, 5-point standard curves with known concentrations of transcribed human universal reference rna were constructed. the amplification efficiencies of lna-based qrt-pcr for studied hkgs varied between  <dig> to 100%, except for arf <dig> where the amplification efficiency of 85% was achieved. the linear regression coefficient  for all ten genes ranged between  <dig> – <dig> . based on  <dig> replicates, intra-assay variation of less than  <dig> % and inter-assay variation of less than  <dig> % were achieved. negative controls using not transcribed rna samples for all genes were negative.

gene expression levels of ten housekeeping genes within the whole 1st cohort sample set
in order to evaluate gene expression levels of all studied hkgs within the whole patient sample set of the 1st cohort, mrna expressions for every gene were measured in individual bal samples. gene expression levels in individual samples showed a broad range of variance between ctt  <dig>   and ctt  <dig>   . out of ten studied genes, actb  and rpl <dig>  were expressed at the highest levels; psmd <dig>  and gps <dig>  at the lowest levels in bal cells. the lowest expression variability within all samples was observed for the gene psmb <dig>  and rpl <dig> . genes psmd <dig>  and gnb2l <dig>  showed the most variable expression within the sample set. f-test showed that psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> had significantly lower variance of ctt values when compared to canx, gnb2l <dig>  actb, psmd <dig>  arf <dig>  gps <dig>  g6pd and gapdh . descriptive statistics of gene expression data and corresponding absolute x-fold change values for all studied genes calculated by the applet bestkeeper are shown in table  <dig>

* stably expressed genes were selected according to the criteria  published in pfaffl et al  <cit> .

analysis of expression stability of ten hkgs in bal cells from the 1st patient cohort by equivalence test and statistical applets bestkeeper, genorm and normfinder
in order to find out the most suitable reference genes for normalisation of gene expression in bal cells, four different statistical approaches  were applied in parallel to assess the gene expression stability of ten hkgs within the whole sample set and also in patient subgroups based on gender, smoking status, treatment, disease type, age, and bal differential cell counts.

a) equivalence test
in order to identify the most stably expressed genes in patient subgroups by equivalence test, we applied two-fold expression change cut-off for group-wise comparisons. genes gapdh and psmd <dig> were identified as the least stably expressed genes in bal samples, equivalently expressed only in subgroups according gender and age . genes arf <dig>  actb, canx, gapdh, gnb2l <dig>  g6pd, gps <dig>  psmd <dig> were found not equivalently expressed in more than two of eight studied subgroups. out of all studied genes, only psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> were found equivalently expressed in all studied subgroups . the comparison of results of equivalence tests for two most stable genes  and two "traditional" reference genes  in all subgroups is shown in fig.  <dig> 

b) analysis by bestkeeper
analysis by the applet bestkeeper showed that only two genes  are stably expressed within the whole data set , as well as in all studied subgroups based on gender, smoking status, treatment, type of the disease, age and bal cellular composition . the expression of genes actb, arf <dig>  canx, gapdh, g6pd, gps <dig>  gnb2l <dig> and psmd <dig> has to be considered as inconsistent , thus they were excluded from further analysis. when the regression analysis was performed with two stable genes, the psmb <dig> was shown to be more suitable as a reference gene  than rpl <dig> .

c) analysis by genorm
average expression stability measure of ten hkgs in the whole sample group during stepwise exclusion of the least stable genes by the applet genorm resulted in following gene order: the most stable-actb-gps1-gnb2l1-arf1-psmb2-rpl32-canx-g6pd-psmd2-gapdh-the least stable. when the applet was applied to particular subgroups, we obtained various ranking lists of suitable reference genes for various subgroups: e.g. actb and gnb2l <dig> were the most stable genes for smokers and actb and psmb <dig> for non-smokers; psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> were the most stable genes for males and actb and gnb2l <dig> for females.

d) analysis by normfinder
analysis by the applet normfinder ranked ten genes according their expression stability in the whole patient set in the following order: the most stable-actb-psmb2-gnb2l1-arf1-gps1-rpl32-canx-g6pd psmd2-gapdh-the least stable. however, we obtained various ranking lists when we calculated the expression stability of ten investigated hkgs in subgroups: e.g. genes psmb <dig> and arf <dig> were the most stable genes in subgroups based on smoking status , actb and gnb2l <dig> were the most stable genes in subgroups based on gender .

validation of expression stability of ten hkgs in bal cells from the 2nd patient cohort by equivalence test
in order to confirm that psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> genes, identified as the most stable genes in the aforementioned analyses in the 1st cohort, has indeed the most stable mrna expression unaffected by range of tested variables, we investigated gene expression of all ten genes in the second, independent bal cohort  by equivalence test. the relative gene expression values for all genes were compared among the patient subgroups based on gender, smoking status, and clinical characteristics such as presence of disease, presence of löfgren's syndrome, involvement of parenchyma, involvement of other organs than lung and bal differential cell counts . out of ten studied genes, only psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> genes were equivalently expressed in all tested subgroups of the second cohort.

assessment on the minimal number of reference genes for normalisation of qrt-pcr in bal cells
in order to evaluate the minimal number of reference genes for normalisation of qrt-pcr in bal cells, we calculated the normalisation factors for novel reference genes and their combination  and for the "traditional" reference genes in lung settings  in all individual samples in both cohorts separately. generally, the most suitable reference genes are the genes with mean nf value closest to  <dig> and with the lowest sd. gene psmb <dig> alone showed the lowest mean nf, sd and coefficient of variation  in both cohorts . gene rpl <dig> alone showed in both cohorts the same mean nf as psmb <dig> gene, but higher sd and cv . pairing of psmb <dig> with rpl <dig> did not significantly improve the mean nf value and the variability  compared to psmb <dig> or rpl <dig> alone. genes actb  and gapdh  were found less suitable as reference genes for bal cells. we, therefore, recommend single genes psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> as denominators for gene expression studies in bal cells.

effect of the used reference gene on relative target gene expression values: study of mrna expression of infg and ccl <dig> known to be associated with pulmonary sarcoidosis 
in order to demonstrate the effect of used reference genes on the result of target gene expression data in bal cells, we investigated relative mrna expression of two cytokines known to be associated with sarcoidosis, infg and ccl <dig>  in sarcoidosis patients and control subjects . the following genes were applied as denominators: 1) reference genes validated in our study  and 2) "traditional" reference genes . the data are presented as a mean fold change of relative expression compared to control subjects .

relative mrna expression levels of infg were higher in sarcoidosis patients than in control subjects when the normalisation was done with gene psmb <dig> , with gene rpl <dig> , and with gene pair psmb2-rpl <dig>  . when the expression level of infg was normalised to actb  or to gapdh , the mrna expression of infg did not differ between control subjects and sarcoidosis patients .

similar, when ccl <dig> mrna levels were expressed as a ratio to actb  or to gapdh , there were not significant differences in mrna levels in bal cells between sarcoidosis patients with chest radiographic stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> patients. using genes psmb <dig>  and gene rpl <dig> , and gene pair psmb2-rpl <dig>  as denominators, ccl <dig> mrna levels differed between chest radiographic stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> sarcoidosis patients .

discussion
aiming at finding suitable reference genes for quantitative gene expression profiling studies in bronchoalveolar cells, we have investigated the gene expression of ten housekeeping genes selected according their expression stability reported in literature or their common use in qrt-pcr. out of these, two genes psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> were found constantly expressed in unseparated bal cells from seventy-one subjects irrespective of lung pathology, smoking status, gender, treatment, age and bal cellular composition. the stability of mrna expression of psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> genes was further validated in the second, independent bal cohort of sixty-three sarcoidosis patients and seventeen control subjects. by contrast to psmb <dig> and rpl <dig>  expression levels of genes actb, arf <dig>  canx, gapdh, g6pd, gps <dig>  gnb2l <dig> and psmd <dig> considerably varied among studied patient subgroups in both investigated cohorts thus making these genes less suitable for the normalisation in qrt-pcr. we, therefore, recommend psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> as suitable reference genes for the normalisation of the gene expression in unseparated bal cells, namely in interstitial lung diseases. moreover, based on our data, psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> represent promising candidate reference genes for other lung pathologies such as copd and cancer. finally, we demonstrated on the example of infg and ccl <dig> mrna expression in sarcoidosis that the normalisation with validated reference genes in clinical samples is absolute prerequisite for obtaining clinically meaningful information from qrt-pcr.

although qrt-pcr is an established method for quantifying of mrna expression in bal samples, normalisation for differences among individual samples is the major difficulty of this methodology  <cit> . several normalisation strategies can be applied: normalisation to sample volume, to total rna and to internal reference genes or their combination. normalisation to equal volumes on its own is not suitable for respiratory settings because bal samples differ in cell counts and cellular composition. the other approach, the normalisation for quantity of total rna, is disqualified because it does not correct for differences in rna quality and in reverse transcriptase efficiencies among samples  <cit> . nowadays, the endogenous reference genes represent the most suitable and easiest way for normalisation of clinical samples in qrt-pcr  <cit> . moreover, reference genes may correct also for differences in rna integrity among the samples  <cit> . similarly to huggett et al  <cit> , we affirm that the combination of similar sample size, similar rna concentration in reverse transcription and use of validated reference genes represents the proper normalisation strategy for bal samples.

although it is known that the normalisation with unsuitable reference gene may lead to misinterpretation of target genes expression data  <cit> , most investigators have generally used the genes gapdh and actb as reference genes to normalize qrt-pcr in lung settings without previous validation  <cit> . the reason may be the fact that the known approaches for validation of reference gene stability have been introduced mainly for cell cultures and tissues  <cit>  and no general approach for validation of reference genes in clinical samples is recommended nowadays. in our study, we applied four different mathematical and statistical models to select stably expressed hkgs genes in bal samples. similarly to robinson et al  <cit> , we observed that the output of the most suitable reference genes using pair-wise approach genorm  <cit>  is influenced by chosen set of candidate genes, and the ranking of the genes occurs according the similarity in expression profiles  <cit> . another applet, the model-based approach normfinder  <cit> , takes already into account the individual gene expression variability and calculates the gene expression stability in subgroups. by contrast to andersen et al  <cit> , who compared gene expression in two types of cancer tissues, we aimed to investigate the influence of many variables  on the expression stability of studied genes. doing so, we obtained various ranking lists of suitable reference genes for various subgroups, thus making normfinder approach less suitable for our purpose. using the third used approach, the bestkeeper applet, only psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> were revealed as stably expressed genes in bal samples, the eight remaining genes were excluded from further analyses as inconsistently expressed  <cit> . moreover, the limitation of this approach is the use of pearson's correlation  <cit> , which makes it unsuitable for analyses of non-normally distributed data commonly observed in clinical sample sets. the heterogeneity of the results obtained by the statistical applet bestkeeper, genorm and normfinder and also having in mind our aim to identify genes stably expressed irrespective of many variables  contributed to our final decision to apply equivalence test into our analyses of hkgs expression stability in bal cells. doing so, to exclude genes with high expression variability within the sample set and studied subgroups, we set very strict criteria corresponding to two-fold change in gene expression  <cit> . similarly to previous reports  <cit>  we observed that "traditional" reference genes like actb and gapdh are indeed unsuitable for normalisation of gene expression in bal cells. even in the case of gnb2l <dig>  gene recommended as a reference gene for bal macrophages from copd patients  <cit> , we observed that its expression in bal cells is influenced by lung pathology, treatment and by eosinophil and neutrophil counts in bal samples. only two genes, psmb <dig> and rpl <dig>  were found constantly expressed in all studied subgroups irrespective of smoking, gender, treatment, age, lung pathology and bal cellular composition. to enhance the evidence about invariable expression of psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> genes, their expression was further validated in second, independent bal cohort of patients with sarcoidosis and control subjects. we are aware that we dealt mostly with bronchoalveolar cells from interstitial lung diseases and sample sizes of other diseases have been limited. addressing this limitation in the future is prerequisite for definite conclusion about general usage of psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> as reference genes for expression studies in lung compartment as a whole.

psmb <dig> belongs to the group of genes encoding for constitutively expressed 20s proteasomal core subunits, rpl <dig> is a gene encoding for a component of the 60s ribosomal subunit. various ribosomal proteins have been already validated for qrt-pcr: rpl13a for the pancreas and the prostate tissues  <cit> , lrp <dig> for adipose tissue  <cit> , rpl <dig> for human neutrophils  <cit>  and bal macrophages from copd patients, where it was stable irrespective of disease severity  <cit> . psmb <dig> showed only 29% variation in expression among  <dig> human tissues by microarray technique  <cit>  and here we show for the first time its suitability as a reference gene for qrt-pcr also in unsepared bal cells.

there has been ongoing discussion about the minimal number of reference genes required for qrt-pcr in clinical samples. although the combination of more than one normalisation gene resulted in improved accuracy in several studies  <cit> , other investigators showed that normalisation with a single gene is sufficient for most research applications  <cit> . also our analyses showed that the combination of two most stable genes  did not yield improved precision over normalisation with psmb <dig> or rpl <dig> genes alone. we, therefore, suggest that the use of single reference genes psmb <dig> or rpl <dig> is sufficient for normalisation of target gene expression in bal cells, at least in interstitial lung diseases, where we validated their expression stability in the second, independent bal cohort. psmb <dig> gene is a moderate-copy gene, thus can better control for rna isolation efficiency, rna quality and rt-efficiency than rpl <dig> expressed at high abundance.

in order to demonstrate that the normalisation with reference genes with variable expression may indeed lead to the misinterpretation of target gene expression and even to missing the identification of clinically relevant molecules, we applied the newly defined reference genes for investigation of mrna levels of two cytokine genes reported to be associated with sarcoidosis. these were: th <dig> cytokine infg, which mrna and protein was elevated in th <dig> polarised sarcoidosis  <cit>  and cc chemokine ligand -2/mcp- <dig>  implicated in the development of sarcoid alveolitis namely in chest x-ray stage  <dig> disease  <cit> . in our patients, increase of infg mrna in sarcoid bal cells was observed only when psmb2/rpl <dig> were used as denominators in the normalization procedure. controversially, normalization of infg transcripts to actb/gapdh did not resulted in infg mrna up-regulation. similarly, ccl <dig> mrna up-regulation in sarcoid chest x-ray stage  <dig> disease was observed when stably expressed reference genes psmb2/rpl <dig> were used. use of actb/gapdh as denominators again yielded inconclusive, ambiguous expression data. by these reports we emphasize that our results provide an important and clear message for pulmonary science because only using validated  reference genes for normalization will one ensure that detected changes in target gene expressions in bal samples are valid and therefore clinically meaningful. by contrast, usage of genes with variable expression such as actb or gapdh for normalization leads to misinterpretation of target gene expression in lung samples.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study aimed at identifying stable genes, the expression of which is not influenced by variables such as smoking, gender, age, lung pathology, treatment and bal cellular composition. genes psmb <dig> and rpl <dig> fulfilled the above criteria, and, therefore, they represent suitable normalisation genes for qrt-pcr in bronchoalveolar cells, namely for studies in sarcoidosis and other interstitial lung diseases.
