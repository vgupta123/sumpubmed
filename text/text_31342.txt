BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is a severe respiratory infectious disease in which protective immunity and pathological hypersensitivity to an intracellular bacterium coexist  <cit> . in  <dig>  there were  <dig> million incident cases and  <dig>  million deaths  <cit> . it is difficult to cure with anti-tb chemotherapy because a long treatment duration  with multiple drugs was used on active tb, many tb patients cannot complete a full period of treatment, which lead to failure of treatment and acquired drug resistance with eventual creation of multi-drug-resistant tb   <cit> . accordingly, effective vaccines are needed in the face of failing drug treatments, and this may include therapeutic vaccines. protective immunity against tb is largely attributed to a cellular immune response in which the production of the th1-type cytokines  predominates over the production of the th2-type cytokines  . dna vaccination has been found to establish and boost antigen-specific cellular immunity in the direction of responses. furthermore, immunotherapy with plasmid dna has been found to be an effective adjunctive treatment in combination with antibacterial chemotherapy in mice. it both shortened the period of treatment and improved the therapy outcome of latent tb infection  <cit> . furthermore, we and others have shown that ag85a dna vaccine can also have immunotherapeutic effects against mdr-tb in mice . here we report that the rv2190c gene of mycobacterium tuberculosis  is similarly effective as a therapeutic dna vaccine. the open reading frame  contains  <dig> nucleotides and encodes a hypothetical protein with an nlpc/p <dig> domain  <cit> . målen et al.  <cit>  identified the protein product of rv2190c in mtb culture filtrate, showing that it could be expressed and secreted in vitro. parthasarathy et al.  <cit>  showed that the gene and its protein product were essential for normal growth and virulence of mtb in vivo and mcmurry et al.  <cit>  found that rv2190c peptide could stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells to secrete ifn-γ in persons with latent tb infection. beyond that, mtb rv2190c antigen has not been extensively studied and thus therefore presents new possibilities for developing drug targets, diagnostic reagents and vaccines. accordingly we evaluated its immunogenicity and immunotherapeutic effects as a dna vaccine in mice.

discussion
in this study, a dna sequence encoding mtb rv2190c protein was inserted into plasmid vectors pet30a and pvax <dig>  thereby recombinant rv2190c protein and rv2190c dna vaccine were prepared and subsequently used to compare the therapeutic effects of rv2190c dna with those of ag85a dna as vaccines against tb in mice.

the cellular immune responses to rv2190c dna were measured as increase in frequency of circulating t cells that produced either ifn-γ or il- <dig> in response to cognate vaccine antigen since these cytokines are markers of protective th <dig> responses and non-protective th <dig> responses respectively. a balance between th <dig> and th <dig> in which th <dig> predominates is essential for the control of tb and mycobacterial infection in mice and human  <cit> . in this study, the significantly increased ifn-γ level in the spleen lymphocyte culture supernatant, the abundance of th <dig> cells and elevatory ratios of th <dig> /th <dig> cells in antigen-specifically stimulated whole blood from the rv2190c dna group were all similar to the results obtained in the ag85a dna group. thus both vaccines induced a predominantly th <dig> immune response . this finding was consistent with evidence from mcmurry et al.  <cit>  showing that rv2190c peptide can induce ifn-γ production in cells from persons with latent tb infection, and indicated a potential utility of rv2190c antigen in therapeutic vaccination.

when used to treat infected mice, rv2190c dna vaccine did indeed reduce the numbers of live bacteria found in the organs sampled after 6 weeks of treatment when compared to control mice. however, the reduction in lung bacterial load was small, not statistically significant, and less than that obtained after ag85a dna treatment. in contrast, the reduction of load in the spleen was significant, but again less than that observed after ag85a dna treatment. apparently, although the rv2190c protein enhanced antibacterial immunity it was in this respect a less effective vaccine antigen than the ag85a protein. nevertheless, in a practical therapeutic vaccine for human use, more than one antigen is likely to be required and rv2190c is clearly a candidate for inclusion. the greater effects in spleen than in lung suggest that the dna vaccines were more active against bacteria in extra-pulmonary sites than in the lung, but whether this was due to differential effects on bacterial dissemination, growth inhibition or killing was not investigated. although organ bacterial load is one of the important indicators to evaluate curative effects on animal tb experiments  <cit> , evaluation of the impact upon pathology is also essential. strikingly, the lesions in the lungs of rv2190c dna and ag85a dna vaccinated groups were similarly lessened, suggesting that rv2190c dna and ag85a dna provided similarly efficient immunotherapy for tb disease in this model.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully constructed a mtb rv2190c dna vaccine that could induce th1-type cellular immune reactions in mice and had some immunotherapeutic effects on tuberculosis in mice. it may have potential for use in an immunotherapeutic dna vaccine against tb.
