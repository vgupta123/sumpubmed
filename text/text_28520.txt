BACKGROUND
a rich diversity of histone modifications affect chromatin structure and/or gene activation and repression in eukaryotes reviewed by  <cit> . chromatin organization plays a crucial role in plant gene regulation, employing conserved and unique mechanisms compared to those of other eukaryotes  <cit> . in mammals, as well as plants  <cit> , the presence of activating histone modifications such as trimethylated lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  and acetylated lysine  <dig>  at the transcription start site  are good predictors of gene expression  <cit> . for example, the degree of h3k <dig> trimethylation at the tss is directly proportional to transcript expression level  <cit> . in mammals, monomethylated h3k <dig>  is preferentially associated with enhancer elements, while dimethylated h3k <dig>  is associated with enhancers and promoters, as well as with “poised” genes that are expressed at defined developmental stages or in specific cell types  <cit> . h3k <dig> methylation, in contrast, is thought to mediate rna polymerase ii  elongation and act as docking sites for transcript-processing enzymes reviewed by  <cit> . in general, plants have a similar histone code to that of mammals, with some exceptions such as a higher abundance of h3k4me <dig> reviewed by  <cit> .

lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig> is trimethylated by set <dig> of the trithorax protein complex compass in yeast  <cit> , with atxr <dig> and to some extent atx <dig> performing this function in arabidopsis  <cit> . in yeast, h3k <dig> trimethylation is predicated on rad6-mediated ubiquitination of lysine  <dig> of histone h2b   <cit> . the uh2b-k <dig> modification is critical for h3k <dig> methylation by set <dig>  possibly acting to open the chromatin structure for set <dig> targeting  <cit> . set <dig> associates with the activated form of pol ii, in part through the paf <dig> complex, ensuring that h2b ubiquitination and h3k <dig> methylation occur proximal to the pre-initiation complex reviewed by  <cit> . thus, h3k4me <dig> appears to be established by active transcription itself, is reported to occur at over 90% of pol ii-enriched sites in human  <cit>  and is associated with transcription initiation but not necessarily transcription elongation in mammals  <cit> . since the h3k4me <dig> modification endures at previously active genes for up to several hours after silencing in yeast, it represents evidence of both active and recent transcription  <cit> . h3k <dig> methylation can, however, be dynamically reversed by histone demethylases  <cit> . the function of h3k4me <dig> is to recruit tfiid to active promoters and assisting in pre-initiation complex formation, which is enhanced in the presence of a tata box  <cit> , via interaction with the taf <dig> subunit  <cit> . a number of other proteins are known to bind to h3k4me <dig> at specific loci, which are in turn tethered to, or recruit, enzymes that manipulate the local chromatin structure  <cit> .

at human tsss, “open” chromatin regions that are hypersensitive to dnase i cleavage are followed by a prominent h3k4me <dig> signal immediately downstream; a relationship so strong that the pattern can be used to annotate tsss and the direction of transcription  <cit> . in plants, h3k4me <dig> histone modifications occur almost exclusively in genes and their promoters but preferentially occupy genic regions 250– <dig> bp  or 500– <dig> bp  downstream of the tss  <cit> . genes occupied by h3k4me <dig>  especially in the absence of h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  generally display low tissue specificity but high levels of constitutive expression in arabidopsis  <cit> . however in two drought studies, h3k4me <dig> distribution broadened considerably along genes differentially expressed during drought stress in arabidopsis  <cit> , and showed differential trimethylation for a proportion of genes differentially expressed during drought stress in rice  <cit> , suggesting h3k4me <dig> can also be associated with tightly regulated pathways.

due to the widespread use of woody biomass in pulp, paper and chemical cellulose industries, various studies have undertaken to understand the transcriptional regulation of xylogenesis   <cit> . modified histones have been poorly studied in woody tissues, despite their importance in growth and development. secondary xylem, which forms the characteristic swelling of woody plant stems, develops from xylem mother cells in the vascular cambium, a lateral meristem  <cit> . xylem mother cells form nascent fusiform initials that give rise to fibers and vessels, the two main cell types constituting secondary xylem, undergoing elongation, secondary cell wall deposition, lignification and programmed cell death within a thin layer of tissue  known as developing secondary xylem   <cit> . chromatin immunoprecipitation  has only recently been applied to vascular tissues to study protein-dna interactions  <cit> . these have been restricted to the dsx tissue rather than mature xylem, since dead or dying cells and large quantities of secondary cell wall material characterising fibers and vessels pose significant challenges to nuclei isolation.

here, we aimed to determine the role of the activating histone modification h3k4me <dig> in the epigenomic regulation of xylogenesis, using field-growing eucalyptus grandis trees as our model. we hypothesized that h3k4me <dig> signals marking pol ii-transcribed genes, including those involved in wood formation, can predict their corresponding transcript levels in developing xylem. we assessed and optimized existing protocols for the isolation of crosslinked chromatin from field-collected dsx tissue for use in chip-seq assays, and modified a nano-chip-seq protocol for the amplification of chip dna. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide study of the role of a modified histone in developing wood.

RESULTS
chip-seq analysis of h3k4me <dig> in e. grandis developing secondary xylem
we collected dsx samples in spring from two seven-year-old e. grandis individuals  growing in a plantation. we optimized chromatin fixation, isolation and sonication and assessed isolated chromatin quality using micrococcal nuclease . we then conducted a chip-seq analysis of the activating histone mark h3k4me <dig> to evaluate our modified chip-seq protocol  and to better understand the role of this signature in developing xylem gene regulation. we selected a commercial antibody for h3k4me <dig> which had been validated for chip analyses in arabidopsis  <cit> . antibody recognition of the h3kme <dig> protein in eucalyptus dsx was confirmed by western blot analysis of dsx nuclear extracts, where the antibody recognized a ~ <dig> kda band corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of h3k4me <dig> . additionally, a dotblot assay using synthetic peptides representing all possible methylated and non-methylated variants of h3k4me <dig> showed that the antibody specifically recognized only the trimethylated variant . in trial experiments, different amounts of anti-h3k4me <dig> antibody produced similar enrichments of candidate regions as assessed by chip-qpcr .

we generally obtained 1– <dig> ng chip-enriched dna from the modified protocol by kaufmann et al.  <cit> . in order to perform illumina sequencing with enough chip dna to spare for qpcr validation, we adopted a “nano-chip-seq” approach developed for chip-seq analysis of limited mammalian cell numbers  <cit> . modifications to the adli & bernstein  <cit>  chip dna amplification protocol  allowed for successful amplification of  <dig> ng or less of template , producing up to several hundred nanograms of template for library preparation.

following chip dna amplification and library construction, we generated over  <dig> million 50-base paired-end reads from both the h3k4me3-enriched and input  libraries . the sequences were trimmed to remove primer sequences and mapped to the v. <dig> . annotation of the e. grandis reference genome  <cit> . for one individual , we additionally sequenced an igg2a negative control library to remove false positive peaks due to nonspecific antibody or protein a binding . between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million read pairs mapped uniquely for each h3k4me <dig> and input replicate after filtering for pcr-induced duplicated reads . only  <dig> % of igg2a library reads mapped to the genome, likely reflecting the lower complexity of non-specifically bound targets. read coverage along the genome correlated significantly  between biological replicates . strand cross-correlation analysis showed that all h3k4me <dig> chip libraries were enriched to an efficiency well within encode standards  <cit>  .

we followed encode guidelines  <cit>  for peak-calling using model-based analysis of chip-seq  software  <cit> , employing the irreproducible discovery rate  method to identify peaks from chip-seq data from both replicates with a low false positive rate  and a high degree of biological replication . to assess within- and between-sample consistency, the number of shared peaks identified separately for biological replicates, randomly generated within-sample pseudoreplicates, and randomly generated pseudoreplicates of pooled data were within two-fold of each other , in agreement with encode recommendations  <cit> . within-sample pseudoreplicates of each biological replicate produced similar idr profiles , indicating similar data quality for each biological replicate.

after removing  <dig> false positive peaks shared with the igg2a negative control sample, our method identified  <dig>  significant h3k4me <dig> peaks . subsampling of increasing proportions of the mapped tags showed that the number of peaks called separately for each replicate began to plateau , suggesting near-saturation of h3k4me <dig> peak detection at the sequencing depths obtained in this study. the peaks, which spanned a median interval of  <dig> bp , covered  <dig>  mb  of the assembled genome, ~86% of which overlapped annotated gene models and/or promoter regions within  <dig> kb upstream of the predicted tss.  <dig>  target genes were identified as enriched for h3k4me <dig> based on their physical overlap with a significant peak . of the  <dig>  peaks that did not overlap a gene model in the v. <dig> . genome annotation, a further  <dig> overlapped some  <dig> low-confidence gene annotations that were previously removed from the first annotation , suggesting that some of these may be bona fide gene models .

on average, ~48% of a given peak interval, defined here as the genomic span of a significant peak, overlapped intronic sequence, and ~25% overlapped exon sequence . in intergenic regions, ~5% of peak intervals overlapped  <dig> kb promoter regions of genes . thus, compared to the genomic frequency of these annotations , h3k4me <dig> peak distribution was heavily biased towards genes. we also assessed the h3k4me <dig> enrichment of known and predicted noncoding rna  elements in the e. grandis genome  <cit> . disregarding ambiguous h3k4me <dig> peaks that overlapped with both ncrnas and genes, ~18% of small nucleolar rnas  and ~2% of known or predicted micrornas  were enriched for h3k4me <dig> whereas transfer rnas , ribosomal rnas , small nuclear rnas , antisense rnas and small rnas  showed no or significantly less enrichment . a number of putative targets of the enriched mirnas were identified that remain to be experimentally verified . the enriched snornas appeared to consist of  <dig> polycistronic clusters , a common arrangement in plants  <cit> . these data are consistent with the fact that mirnas and many snornas are transcribed by pol ii and might hence be expected to exhibit h3k4me <dig> modifications when expressed  <cit> .figure  <dig> overlap of h3k4me <dig> chip-seq peaks with genomic features.  percentage of all h3k4me <dig> peak intervals overlapping different genomic features. the nonredundant set of annotated exons, introns, 5’ untranslated regions  and 3’ untranslated regions  has been collated as representing genes, whereas  <dig> kb upstream promoter regions and the remaining genomic regions are classified as “intergenic”.  percentage of the e. grandis genome assigned to different genomic features according to the v. <dig>  annotation.

we reconstructed the binding profile of h3k4me <dig> relative to genic regions by calculating per-base coverage of h3k4me <dig> and input libraries across all annotated genes, as well as the upstream and downstream sequences, in a bin-wise manner. as expected, h3k4me3-enriched library coverage peaked shortly after the tss . in contrast, input coverage was comparatively uniform across transcribed regions and their flanking non-coding sequences . similarly, when absolute distance relative to the tss or tts  was analysed for h3k4me <dig> and input coverage across genes, the h3k4me <dig> profile yielded a prominent peak ~600- <dig> bp downstream of the tss . the position of the peak was similar for genes of different lengths .figure  <dig> h3k4me <dig> and input chip-seq profiles across the  <dig> kb promoter, transcribed and  <dig> kb downstream regions of annotated loci.  bin-wise, showing relative gene length.  absolute distance anchored at the 5’ and 3’ ends of transcribed regions. the 5’ and 3’ regions were analysed separately, thus profiles overlap for genes <  <dig> kb. per-base coverage values were normalized between h3k4me <dig> and input libraries. tss, transcription start site; tts, transcription termination site; gene, regions annotated as transcribed in e. grandis v. <dig> .



expression dynamics of h3k4me3-enriched genes
h3k4me <dig> enrichment of genes is tightly associated with their corresponding transcript abundances  <cit> . we investigated the relationship between h3k4me <dig> modification of genes and their rna-seq expression values in dsx tissue collected from a different trial  <cit> . the sample collection, data analysis and results of this experiment are discussed in vining et al.  <cit> . on average, genes enriched for h3k4me <dig> were expressed almost two-fold higher than the full set of annotated genes with detected expression in dsx, and over five-fold more than those lacking the histone modification . less than one percent of h3k4me3-enriched genes had no expression evidence . after ranking expressed genes by transcript abundance and dividing them into ten ordinal expression level categories of equal size , the percentage of genes exhibiting h3k <dig> trimethylation increased with gene expression levels . of the top tenth of genes expressed in dsx,  <dig> % were trimethylated at h3k <dig>  compared to  <dig> % of genes with no detected expression . these results indicate that h3k4me <dig> enrichment of genes is indeed predictive of gene activation, where h3k4me <dig> is most often associated with genes expressed at high levels.figure  <dig> expression properties associated with h3k4me <dig> enrichment in developing secondary xylem tissue.  percentage of genes enriched for h3k4me <dig> among non-expressed genes and genes with increasing expression levels, represented as ten ordinal categories of similar size .  h3k4me <dig> enrichment  at the 5’ regions of transcribed genes, for each of the expression level categories in . average per-base coverage values from  <dig> kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of the transcriptional start site  is shown for each expression level category.  tissue specificity of genes enriched for h3k4me <dig> , genes expressed in developing secondary xylem regardless of histone modification status , and genes expressed in developing secondary xylem but lacking h3k4me <dig> modification , as measured by shannon entropy. high entropy values indicate broad, even expression across tissues; low values indicate high tissue specificity. the maximum possible entropy value for this data is  <dig> .



we next investigated whether local coverage of mapped h3k4me <dig> chip-seq reads, which reflects the degree of enrichment of h3k <dig> trimethylation at a given locus, is related to transcript levels. average h3k4me <dig> chip-seq library coverage was calculated for each base around the 5’ regions of genes for each expression level category in figure 3a. as expected, we found that h3k4me <dig> enrichment was most pronounced around the 5’ region of genes in the top expression level category, showing a concordant decrease with less abundant transcript levels . this relationship was maintained throughout the  <dig> kb region downstream of the tss . these results confirm that the degree of h3k <dig> trimethylation at a locus is correlated with transcript abundance in eucalyptus dsx.

in addition to an association with gene expression, it was reported in arabidopsis thaliana that genes enriched for h3k4me <dig> tended to be less tissue-specific than those lacking the h3k4me <dig> modification, regardless of h3k <dig> mono- or dimethylation states  <cit> . to further explore the relationship between h3k4me <dig> modification and expression in eucalyptus, shannon entropy values  <cit>  of relative transcript abundance across seven tissues and organs  <cit>  were calculated for the  <dig>  genes that were expressed in at least one tissue and overlapped a significant h3k4me <dig> peak, and compared to entropy values for  all genes expressed in dsx, and  expressed genes that were not significantly enriched for h3k4me <dig>  genes enriched for h3k4me <dig> had significantly higher entropy values  compared to both the expressed, and expressed but lacking h3k4me <dig>  gene sets  . similarly, genes lacking the h3k4me <dig> mark were significantly more tissue-specific than all expressed genes in dsx . thus, h3k4me3-enriched genes tend not only to be highly expressed, but also show less tissue specificity in general than unenriched genes in eucalyptus. it is noteworthy, however, that a large proportion  of h3k4me3-enriched genes had entropy values lower than the average of  <dig>  for genes expressed in dsx . furthermore, the average relative expression of genes in dsx  was higher for h3k4me3-enriched genes  than unenriched genes  and the total dsx transcriptome . this tissue bias is consistent with the association of h3k4me <dig> with transcriptional activation in the sampled tissue, and suggests that h3k <dig> trimethylation occurs at genes with strong, broad expression, as well as with expressed genes preferentially expressed in dsx.

the role of h3k4me <dig> modification in regulating wood-related biological processes
since the  <dig>  genes enriched for h3k4me <dig> in dsx comprise over 26% of those in the v. <dig> . annotation and tend to be more broadly expressed than those lacking the modification, it was hypothesized that h3k4me3-enriched genes would be overrepresented for general biological processes rather than those specific to wood formation. since h3k4me <dig> is strongly associated with transcribed genes, we used as the reference set all genes transcribed in dsx tissue to assess whether those enriched for h3k4me <dig> genes showed over- or underrepresentation of particular biological functions represented in this set. as expected, broad biological functions such as translation, protein metabolism and catabolism, primary metabolism and mrna metabolism were significantly overrepresented among h3k4-trimethylated genes . interestingly, relative to genes expressed in dsx tissue, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, responses to biotic and abiotic stress and a number of regulatory processes were significantly underrepresented among h3k4me3-trimethylated genes .

while go terms characteristic of xylogenesis, such as secondary cell wall biosynthetic processes, were not overrepresented among h3k4me3-enriched genes, h3k <dig> trimethylation at genes involved in xylogenesis provides insights into how they are regulated at the chromatin level. a substantial proportion  of annotated functional homologs of cellulose and xylan biosynthesis-associated genes  <cit>  were enriched for h3k4me <dig> , most of which were highly and preferentially expressed in dsx tissue . a smaller proportion  of phenylpropanoid pathway genes overlapped h3k4me <dig> peaks owing to a large number of tandemly duplicated homologs with low transcript abundance , possibly explaining the significant underrepresentation of this pathway among h3k4me3-enriched genes. only considering phenylpropanoid pathway genes expressed above the median fpkm level, ~55% were enriched for h3k4me <dig> . mapping of nearest arabidopsis thaliana homologs of h3k4me3-enriched eucalyptus genes and their corresponding transcript abundance in dsx to the kegg phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway ath00940;  <cit>  showed that most of the central monolignol biosynthetic enzymes were h3k4-trimethylated . this suggests a biologically relevant role for h3k4me <dig> in the regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway.figure  <dig> association of h3k4me <dig> secondary cell wall candidate genes in e. grandis.  cellulose and xylan biosynthesis.  phenylpropanoid biosynthesis . genes enriched  or unenriched  for h3k4me <dig> were plotted by absolute transcript abundance in dsx tissue  and relative transcript abundance in dsx tissue compared to shoot tips, young leaves, mature leaves, flowers, roots and phloem . the full gene lists are presented in additional file 3: table s <dig>  table s <dig> 



to validate the chip-seq data, we performed a chip-qpcr analysis focusing on carbohydrate and secondary cell wall-associated loci with evidence of h3k <dig> trimethylation. this method evaluates enrichment directly against mock  chip, whereas the chip-seq peak-calling algorithm uses input as negative control, thus providing an independent assessment of enrichment. all six positive regions identified by chip-seq and assayed by chip-qpcr showed clear immunoprecipitation enrichment  in the h3k4me <dig> chip sample compared to mock chip . we included two controls for the qpcr analysis. in the first, we validated two false positive h3k4me <dig> regions overlapping homologs of snd <dig> and nst <dig> identified through macs analysis of the igg2a  library. these targets showed similar amplification between h3k4me <dig> and mock chip samples as expected . second, we profiled two intergenic negative control regions which showed negligible amplification in both h3k4me <dig> and mock chip samples, showing that there was no template loading bias in the h3k4me <dig> samples .figure  <dig> chip-qpcr validation of h3k4me3-enriched and control loci. the putative arabidopsis ortholog of each candidate is indicated in parenthesis. asterisks denote h3k4me <dig> targets identified in the chip-seq analysis. eucgr.k <dig> and eucgr.d <dig> serve as validations of identified false positives arising from nonspecific binding. two intergenic negative control regions are included. error bars indicate standard deviation of three technical replicates.



discussion
in this study, we sought to explore the role of h3k4me <dig> in the epigenomic regulation of secondary xylem development in e. grandis, modifying and optimizing existing chromatin preparation protocols in order to perform chip-seq on this challenging tissue. over 80% of identified peaks were shared between sampled individuals at a stringent idr , showing that our approach successfully captured biologically relevant binding events. we have shown that high-quality chip-seq profiles of developing xylem collected from mature field-grown trees can be generated using our approach, revealing both known properties of trimethylated h3k <dig> as well as a novel role in the epigenomic regulation of various aspects of xylogenesis.

while the use of a chip dna amplification step allowed for the preparation of illumina sequencing libraries from only 1– <dig> ng, or less, of chip dna in this study, the relatively high proportion of redundant sequences arising from template amplification  is undesirable. we have also frequently found that most of the dna in amplified samples was > <dig> bp in length , resulting in libraries with a small fraction of the dna having the preferred insert size of 100– <dig> bp. these limitations favour the preparation of illumina libraries from unamplified chip dna, where pooling of technical replicates may be necessary to obtain enough chip dna for successful library construction.

in eucalyptus, h3k <dig> trimethylation generally occurs ~ <dig> -  <dig> bp downstream of annotated tsss , irrespective of the gene length, but we point out that this value is dependent on the accuracy of tss predictions in the e. grandis v. <dig> . genome annotation. nonetheless, the observed range is similar to that reported in rice  <cit> , while further from the tss than that in arabidopsis, which mostly occurs within  <dig> bp of the tss  <cit> . the vast majority of h3k4me <dig> peaks were gene-associated , including noncoding rna genes that are predicted to be transcribed by pol ii , and the h3k4me <dig> chip-seq library coverage within the first kilobase after the tss correlated well with transcript abundance . as transcript levels increased, a greater proportion of genes expressed at each level became enriched for h3k4me <dig> , supporting the known function of h3k4me <dig> in keeping expressed genes in a transcriptionally active state  <cit> . the h3k4me <dig> signal at a given locus could represent the degree of h3k4me <dig> trimethylation in one particular cell type, and/or the proportion of cell types in the tissue that are h3k4-trimethylated at that locus. chip-seq analysis of individual xylem cell types remains a future challenge.

h3k4me <dig> peaks predicted on-off states of target genes to a high degree of precision: over 99% of h3k4me3-enriched genes were expressed in dsx tissue, >85% of them above the median fpkm value, and only ~1% of genes without evidence of expression were positive for h3k4me <dig>  considering that our rna-seq data originated from an independent trial, the exceptions to the rule are unsurprising. conversely, gene transcript level was not necessarily predictive of h3k4me <dig> modification at a locus – even among the most highly expressed genes in dsx tissue, ~27% did not show evidence of h3k4me <dig> enrichment . while increased chip-seq sequencing depth may detect more h3k4me <dig> binding events, accurate prediction of mrna abundance generally requires information for more than one histone modification mark  <cit>  and depends largely on transcript quantification methods   <cit> . it is likely that partially functionally redundant histone modifications, such as mono- or dimethylated h3k <dig> or lysine 9-acetylated histone h <dig>  may be sufficient to promote an active chromatin configuration in the absence of h3k4me <dig> 

it was reported in arabidopsis thaliana that h3k4me3-modified genes tend to show less tissue-specificity compared to genes lacking the mark  <cit> , a trend we confirmed in eucalyptus . in light of this, the overrepresentation of general cellular processes and “housekeeping” functions among h3k4me3-associated genes relative to dsx-expressed transcripts  is expected. despite this tendency, we showed that h3k4me <dig> was present at several highly expressed genes involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis which were also preferentially expressed in dsx . thus, h3k <dig> trimethylation appears to play a role in the epigenomic regulation of wood formation. it is likely that h3k4me <dig> modification is employed to keep highly expressed genes in an active state once activated in a given tissue or cell type, in this case dsx. the lower tissue specificity of h3k4me3-enriched genes is probably a reflection of a general negative correlation between tissue-specificity and gene expression level  <cit> . for example, the top 10% of genes expressed in dsx in the rna-seq dataset used in this study had significantly higher average entropy than the entire dsx transcriptome .

h3k <dig> trimethylation profiles, especially when combined with dnase-seq data  <cit> , are a useful resource for annotating tsss as well as direction of transcription  <cit> . our h3k4me <dig> data suggest that  <dig> low-confidence gene models in the v. <dig>  annotation that were removed in the v. <dig>  annotation are potentially true gene models. we suggest that these gene models could be prioritized based on both rna-seq coverage as well as h3k4me <dig> fold enrichment provided in additional file  <dig>  we have found numerous examples of h3k4me <dig> peaks located at genomic regions that have not been previously annotated, but show clear rna-seq expression coverage . thus, the h3k4me <dig> data from this study is an important line of evidence for future revisions of the e. grandis genome annotation.

CONCLUSIONS
chip-seq has proved to be a valuable technique for the high-throughput analysis of in vivo protein-dna interactions in yeast, mammals and, to an increasing extent, plants. as this technology becomes more widespread, its application to novel and challenging tissues will require additional optimization and testing. chip-seq combined with a nano-chip-seq protocol allowed us to produce high-quality profiles of a modified histone in developing secondary xylem tissue, here in mature eucalyptus trees, closely following standards recommended by the encode consortium  <cit> . the  <dig>  h3k4me <dig> peaks identified in this study mostly overlapped the 5’ vicinity of transcribed regions, the enrichment of which was strongly correlated with gene expression. while h3k4me3-enriched genes tend to be broadly expressed across tissues, this epigenomic mark is associated with highly expressed, tissue-specific genes with crucial functions in wood formation. the h3k4me3-enriched mirnas and snornas identified in this study suggest that these noncoding rnas are biologically active in developing secondary xylem, guiding future research into the post-transcriptional regulation of wood formation. finally, a number of h3k4me <dig> peaks were located at unannotated genomic regions with transcriptional evidence, providing a valuable resource for improved annotation of the e. grandis genome sequence. epigenomic profiles such as modified histone distributions have important implications for how we understand and interpret genome function. this study probes the poorly understood role of chromatin organization during xylogenesis and promotes further investigation into the functions of epigenomic features in plants. researchers can visualize h3k4me <dig> chip-seq data reported here in a custom e. grandis genome browser in eucgenie  <cit> .
