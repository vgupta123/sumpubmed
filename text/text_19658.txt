BACKGROUND
the eukaryote cellular machinery has been shown to contain several alternative processing mechanisms acting on rna. on the pre-mrna level, alternative splicing is a well-known mechanism altering transcripts. this type of alternative processing is particularly important in the nervous system, where it helps determine the properties of many types of neurons  <cit> . although rna editing has received less attention, it is known to fine-tune messenger rna composition by changing single nucleotides . the most common enzymes to perform editing in mammals are the adar  proteins. the adar enzymes adar <dig> and adar <dig> convert adenosines to inosines  within double stranded rna by a hydrolytic deamination . since inosine is interpreted as guanosine  by the splicing and translational machineries, adar editing effectively results in an a-to-g change that may alter the amino acid sequence encoded by the substrate. there are two types of a-to-i edited sites,  hyper-edited sites that are abundant in non-coding and untranslated regions of long, almost completely double stranded, stem loop structures  <cit>  and  selectively edited sites that consist of imperfect stem loop structures, often formed by an exon and a trailing intron sequence. to date, site selective editing has mainly been found in genes involved in neurotransmission.

the known substrates for site selective editing typically have a functional significance due to non-synonymous alteration of a codon that alters the amino acid sequence. both rna strands of a substrate stem often show high conservation of sequence as well as structure in species from human to chicken  <cit> . imperfections in the form of bulges and internal mismatches are important structural features for site selective editing  <cit> . even though only a handful of substrates have been identified, editing has proven to be important for the function of the developing brain in both invertebrates  <cit>  and vertebrates  <cit> .

the method we developed encompasses an initial explorative screen followed by a refinement of potential candidate sites using a novel scoring system. our explorative screen for selectively edited sites consists of two components, the initial identification of candidate sites using rna structure prediction and the subsequent evaluation of these sites using evolutionary sequence conservation. for the first, we developed the program stemprediction to predict edited double stranded rna stems within genomic transcripts that contain sequence pairs with approximate reverse complementarity. for the second, to specifically extract duplexes found in evolutionarily conserved regions, a novel conservation measure was developed and applied that employs multiple alignments of  <dig> vertebrate genomes  <cit> . in the refinement phase, we first used alignments of genomic data and an expressed sequence database  <cit>  to target candidate sequences enriched for a-g mismatches between genomic and transcribed sequences. in addition, candidates were evaluated using a novel 6-bit scoring scheme based on characteristics for known a-to-i edited sites.

similar ideas have been used previously to construct computational screens with the same purpose  <cit> . the hallmarks of these prior screens have been the a-g discrepancy and the clustering of adjacent discrepancies. less used components involve conservation  and prediction of target rna foldback structures. these studies have mainly led to the discovery of thousands of hyper-edited substrates where the editing events arise from inverted repetitive elements such as alu sequences. to avoid the detection of extensively edited long stem loop structures created by alu inverted repeats, we focused on the mouse genome that is devoid of these repetitive elements.

our aim is to find single sites of selective editing that have the potential to re-code the open reading frame . to do this we use only coding sequences from well annotated mouse genes in order to focus on sequences destined for protein synthesis. unique to our screen is also the scoring scheme based on features of known sites of selective editing. the result of applying our extended screen to the mouse genome gives a substantial number of novel putative substrates of which  <dig> have been experimentally tested. of these,  <dig> derive from our combined explorative screen and refinement and an additional  <dig> candidates from the explorative screen alone. that is, in the latter  <dig> we looked for editing events within  <dig> highly conserved stem regions without requiring an a-g mismatch when comparing to the transcript database. among the  <dig> candidates found in the combined screen and refinement, we identified the gabra <dig> transcript. this gene that codes for the Î± <dig> subunit of the gabaa receptor has recently been found by us to be edited at one site, giving rise to an isoleucine to methionine change in the protein sequence. from sites identified using the explorative screen alone, we confirmed editing in several candidates, particularly in the neuron-specific rna binding hu-proteins. our results imply that our method can be used to accurately identify novel substrates for site selective editing.

RESULTS
prediction of rna stem structures within mouse genes
previous work in our laboratory have included the use of mouse genome 430a  <dig>  array  to experimentally detect novel sites of a-to-i editing  <cit> . in this study, we use a novel bioinformatic method to search the sequences from these  <dig>  well annotated mouse genes for new sites of editing in their open reading frames. an advantage of using the mouse genome instead of the human genome is the avoidance of alu repeat elements known to be highly edited but so far without a well defined function. the mouse genome contains inverted repeats within transcribed regions having the potential of being double stranded rna structures targeted for editing. indeed, repeats are also edited in mouse with one documented example of editing in a sine element of the ctn-rna  <cit> . however, editing in the mouse repeats are much more infrequent, possibly due to the higher divergence of the different repetitive elements  <cit> . we first extracted the genome sequences corresponding to the genes on the above mentioned microarray from the mouse genome assembly release  <dig>   <cit> . blastz  <cit>  was then used to identify those transcribed sequences containing nearly exact reverse complementary pairs of subsequences, reasoning that these are likely to form rna duplexes . our blastz search was restricted to mouse genomic regions that:  correspond to one of the  <dig>  mouse genes; and  are alignable with at least  <dig> other species in the multiple sequence alignments  consisting of the mouse genome aligned to  <dig> other vertebrates. the total number of sequence pairs extracted with blastz was  <dig> , <dig>  an average of about  <dig>  per gene.

identification of stems as potential substrates for adar enzymes
both sequence and structure are often phylogenetically well conserved at sites of selective editing. we used our novel program stemprediction  to filter the large sequence collection extracted above with blastz for pairs of sequences exhibiting characteristics of known adar substrates . a key parameter was the max_energy cut-off corresponding to minimum free energy for the stems. we avoided a strict cut-off, since the free energy for known adar substrates are often moderately low . on the other hand, an overly liberal cut-off would inevitably result in a vast amount of noise sequence pairs. based on these considerations, max_energy = - <dig> kcal/mol was chosen. when inspecting the results, we found it unlikely that a looser cut-off would yield any additional interesting predictions. the energy values for the retrieved stems ranged between the extremes - <dig> and - <dig> . the empirical distribution is shown in figure  <dig>  the total number of retrieved stems was  <dig> , <dig>  of those,  <dig> , <dig> candidate stems with a maximum length of  <dig>  nt were selected for further analyses.

identifying conserved stem structures
using the multiple alignment of the mouse genome with several other genomes, we scored each candidate stem according to its level of conservation. based on previously confirmed editing sites, we expected adar substrates to be highly conserved in terms of structure, at least in areas close to the edited site. typically, it is the nucleotides in the helical regions of the adar substrates whose identity is conserved whereas nucleotides in non-helical regions are not, although their non-helical state is maintained. this is evident in a previous phylogenetic analysis that reveals an unusual sequence conservation within exonic and intronic sequences involved in rna editing  <cit> . this turns out to also be true for editing substrates that consists of exon sequence entirely  <cit> . we therefore required a high conservation score on both stem arms of the putative substrates. in order to exclude regions of low conservation we defined the overall conservation score of a stem to be the score of its lowest scoring stem arm but the highest scored site on that arm .

number of sites, gene overlapping sites , areas , gene overlapping areas , and number of predicted stems within the corresponding conservation score intervals are shown.

using the mouse vs.  <dig> vertebrates multiple sequence alignment , we scored each site/nucleotide within the predicted stems according to its level of conservation . this msa attempted to align regions from the mouse genome to as many of the other  <dig> genomes as possible. each mouse site included in an alignment containing at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> species was given a positive conservation score while all other positions were given a conservation score of zero. the conservation score for these 10-aligned consists of two terms, a parsimony term and the tree term, both computed relative to a window of k nucleotides upstream and k nucleotides downstream of s. we found k =  <dig> to be suitable, i.e., the conservation score for s depends on the sites in a window of width  <dig> surrounding s.

the number of sites in the mouse genome that was given a positive conservation score was  <dig> , <dig>  approximately 2% of the mouse genome, and the values ranged from just above zero to  <dig> . an area with conservation score c is a set of contiguous sites, with at least one site scoring c or higher, surrounded by  <dig> consecutive sites all having a score below c.

for each score is tabulated the total number of stems, the number of stems with a-g mismatch , and the percentage of a-g mismatches .

the idea behind using the parsimony term and the tree term is that the former should capture absolute conservation, i.e., its value will be high for sites in which very few mutations have occurred, while the latter should capture conservation in the mouse and human part of the tree which relates the aligned species . that is, a site in which several substitutions have occurred in some small subtree distant from mouse, but where no substitutions has occurred elsewhere, will have a high tree term value. as an example we used the alignment of a genomic sequence of the ampa glutamate receptor, subunit b at the known r/g editing site  . a boxed window  of the first  <dig> nucleotides contains five substitutions altogether. all these have occurred in one species, resulting in a high tree term for this window. further, a section of mouse chromosome  <dig> overlapping the positions for the editing substrates glur-b q/r and r/g, respectively, was plotted against the conservation score . from this graph we can conclude that the genome positions for these two substrates score higher than all other chromosomal positions.

identifying sites of editing
to identify specific sites of selective a-to-i editing within the candidates selected by structure and phylogenetic conservation, a screen was made that discriminate between an a in genomic sequence and a g at the same position in est data for an individual. this is typically an indication of an a-to-i editing site in the mrna sequence. the genomic sequences used in the alignment were matched to the cdna sequence, also called genomic mrna below. however, the sequences in the databases correspond to many individuals, so an a-g mismatch may be caused by single nucleotide polymorphism . therefore, we used the mouse snp database to remove known snps of genomic origin from our a-to-g targets. however, it has previously been shown that over one hundred snps in human are most likely due to a-to-i editing  <cit> . therefore, a-to-g snps verified by the sequencing of ests were not excluded from the screen. we used two databases, mouse est  <cit>  and mouse snp  <cit> , to extract the a-g mismatches. a total of  <dig>  a-g mismatches were identified and of those  <dig>  were rejected due to concurrent hits with a genomic origin in the snp database. thus,  <dig>  high quality a-g mismatches were detected. the number of genes containing a certain number of a-g mismatches ranged between the extremes  <dig> and  <dig> according to the distribution in figure  <dig>  in  <dig>  genes at least one a-g mismatch was detected.

for those regions assigned positive conservation scores, we evaluated our collection of candidate stems for a-g mismatch enrichment. we partitioned the spectrum of conservation scores into sections <  <dig>  50- <dig>  60- <dig>  70- <dig>  80- <dig> and â¥  <dig>  if conservation score and a-g mismatches both indeed are adar substrate characteristics, a-g mismatches will be enriched among candidate stems with high conservation scores. we evaluated this using a null hypothesis according to which an a-g mismatch is independent of a-to-i editing. since we view: i) editing as the only possible explanation for dependence between a-g mismatch and conservation and ii) in order to get a computable p-value, we extend the null hypothesis to include independence between a-g mismatch and conservation. absolute numbers and relative frequencies of a-g mismatches for various conservation scores are shown in table  <dig>  the frequency of a-g mismatch among stems with conservation score <  <dig> and 80- <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the probability of having such a high discrepancy assuming that an a-g mismatch is a random phenomenon with the same distribution in both ranges of conservation score is < 10- <dig>  this p-value was calculated with hoeffding's bound  <cit> . we conclude that there is a correlation between editing and a high conservation score. in both ranges, some of the a-g mismatches could be attributed to random phenomena independent of editing, and we assume that the fraction of randomly occurring a-g mismatches is the same in both ranges. this fraction can be no larger than  <dig> , indicating that the fraction of edited stems in the 80- <dig> range is at least  <dig> , corresponding to  <dig> stems.

site ranking based on known substrates for site selective editing
to narrow down the number of candidates further, we utilized a site ranking scheme as a filter. we first imposed a minimum conservation score for a candidate to be evaluated by the site ranking scheme. using the conservation scores for the predicted stems of known edited sites as a guide , we set this cut-off conservation score to â¥  <dig>  of the  <dig> , <dig> sequences with complementary subsequences identified by blastz, we found  <dig>  stems with conservation scores above this cut-off. to further reduce the number of potential sites, we applied a site scoring criteria based on common features among known adar substrates. the known substrates are too few to apply a machine learning approach or to allow a good understanding of the relative importance of these criteria. so, our approach is purely heuristic. we used a bit-scoring scheme in which a candidate stem could have a maximum score of  <dig> . the first two bits were used to credit conservation even further. to promote the conservation we decided to use the conservation score â¥  <dig> and â¥  <dig>  the reason for this was that the  <dig> top scored known substrates regarding conservation  also are edited close to 100%. assuming the editing frequency to be a quality marker for the conservation trait, we decided to add  <dig> bits in total for highly conserved stems, referred to as cons_ <dig> and cons_ <dig> in table  <dig>  the third bit specifically scores whether an a to g mutation is observed in the transcript data. this bit is called the a-g mutation. a stem has an a-g mutation if  it has an a-g mismatch when comparing genomic and transcribed sequences; and  mouse and a closely related species have an a at the a-g mismatch site in the alignment, while species distant to the mouse have a permanent g at that position as shown for the glur-b r/g site where tetraodon has a genomic g at the r/g site . the fourth bit was used to reward distinct a-g mismatches in both stem arms since the probability of having a-g mismatches in both stem arms is significantly lower than the probability of having an a-g mismatch in only one stem arm. this bit is called a-g_both. to determine whether the a-g substitution would result in a change in the protein sequence, we downloaded all available mrna and protein sequences from the entrez gene site  <cit> . if amino acid changes appeared in the consensus protein sequence due to a-to-g changes it was scored as annotated_aa_change.

a states whether an a-g mismatch has been found in mouse  and human .

b states whether stemprediction has assigned any stem overlapping an edited position, regardless of the stem ranking .

c states whether the stem according to column  <dig> has a conservation score â¥  <dig> 

d to our knowledge this site has not been annotated in mouse which is also emphasized by low sequence similarity between the  <dig> species.

e a-g mismatcher does not detect the annotated site but finds  <dig> additional a-g mismatches in the vicinity, inferring an i/m and a d/g codon change, respectively.

it has previously been shown that there is a sequence bias in the vicinity of an edited adenosine  <cit> . hence, we used algorithms for calculating information content  <cit>  to sort out if and how to score a nearest neighbor distribution of an edited site . the information content in this case is related to whether there is a pattern of nucleotide disposition that differs from the expected with respect to the background distribution. this means that if there is a background distribution of equal amounts of the four different nucleotides and we also find a distribution of equal amounts of nucleotides at a position, we can gain no information at that position, i.e.,  <dig> bits. the calculations are based on known selectively edited sites in mammals where the literature reports more than 40% editing. consequently  <dig> sequences were used to calculate the information pattern Â±  <dig> nt around an edited position. expectedly, we find the highest degree of information just adjacent to the targeted adenosine. the upstream and downstream neighbor had  <dig>  and  <dig>  bits respectively. the downstream preference of a guanosine  and the higher total information content motivated us to score downstream guanosines of a candidate editing site, . we compiled a list of  <dig> selected candidates having a site score of â¥  <dig> . in this list, gabra <dig>  appeared with a score of  <dig>  using other methods this substrate has subsequently been shown by us to be highly edited at one site  in mouse brain  <cit> .

the final list of candidates  which are chosen from all sites having a score â¥  <dig> .

verification of editing using high throughput sequencing technology
to validate editing in the  <dig> candidates, we used the amplicon  <dig> sequencing technology. the advantage of using this technique is that even low levels of editing can be detected with high accuracy. the collection of  <dig> sequences retrieved for each of the  <dig> candidate genes were aligned to the mouse genome. the number of sequences aligning to a candidate gene, and thus the number of alignment rows, ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the  <dig> output contains a phred score for each position indicating the risk of erroneous sequencing for the position in question. that is, even though one can give a general estimate for  <dig> sequencing errors, the phred score provides a much better estimate for any given specific position. in most cases the phred score was reported to be between  <dig> and  <dig> corresponding to 1% and  <dig> % risk respectively. furthermore, all alignments showing any sign of poor quality were discarded. a total of  <dig> positions were found where a genomic a was replaced by a g in at least one of the sequences. the gabra <dig> transcript was found to be edited 93% of the time in these analyses . another gene found to be edited was elavl <dig> . the alignments corresponding to this site contained  <dig> sequences out of which  <dig>  showed an a-g replacement at one site . this editing event causes an amino acid change from aspargine to aspartic acid . also another site confirmed to be edited within this transcript causes an isoleucine to valine  change in  <dig> % of the transcripts. the mhub protein is a neuron-specific rna binding protein with  <dig> rna recognition motifs . both of the edited sites are situated in rrm <dig>  in addition, another  <dig> sites where the editing frequency was higher than  <dig> % were found,  <dig> of these leading to amino acid changes . among these was elavl <dig> , another neuron specific rna binding protein.

discussion
we have described an explorative screen for selectively a-to-i edited sites, based on two components, rna stem structure and conservation of the corresponding sequence. for the stem structure, we use a free energy threshold and characteristics of known adar substrates while the conservation score is used to rank stems. unlike previous attempt to detect sites of editing we have focused on modifications within encoded sequence  <cit> . however, in a recent genome wide screen a fundamentally different approach to detect novel sites of selective editing was used where repetitive elements where filtered  <cit> . in line with our results li et al. stress the finding of widespread editing at low levels  and few edited sites that give rise to a change of the translational code.

an assay was designed for our explorative screen that tests whether highly conserved stems are enriched for positions with an a-g mismatch between the genomic and the transcribed sequence. the result of the evaluation is that a-g mismatches are significantly enriched in highly ranked stems. comparing stems in the 80- <dig> conservation score range with those in the <  <dig> range yields an estimate of  <dig> edited stems in the former. given that true editing events are located in highly conserved stems we consider the frequency of a-g mismatches in the <  <dig> range to be the background we see in the other conservation ranges. consequently a fraction of  <dig>  could always be expected to be noise associated with each of the other ranges. therefore  <dig>  stems in the range 80- <dig> are believed to be stems wherein true editing occurs. the same type of comparison between each of the three intervals 70- <dig>  60- <dig>  and 50- <dig> and the interval <  <dig> yields an estimate of  <dig>  edited stems in the combined conservation score range 50- <dig>  these values are surprisingly high given the number of currently known adar substrates. however, it is noticeable that the conservation score range â¥  <dig> contains relatively few stems with an a-g mismatch. we find two possible explanations for this:  several of the known adar substrates are in this range but have been excluded in order to not bias the calculations with bona-fide substrates,  the editing efficiency is lower than 50% and not registered as an a to g change in the database and  known functional edited sites often have a g in fish and amphibians that are more distantly related to mammals and this prevents a very high conservation score. thus, a conservation score of a true editing event is often impaired by the fact that species far from human/mouse often have a template dna g at the editing site, which lowers the conservation score.

we refined our screen by including several additional components of which a-g mismatch between genomic and transcribed sequences is one. our refinement was applied to mouse orthologs of the known human adar substrates. as seen in table  <dig>  of the known selectively edited sites,  <dig> are contained in a stem structure that:  has an a-g mismatch in mouse as well as human,  has a free energy below the threshold and  has a conservation score above  <dig>  by restricting ourselves to structures with conservation score above  <dig>  we lose some of the known adar substrates but the majority satisfy this requirement. from the final list, it is worth noting that the r/g and q/r sites of glur-b, and the i/v site of kcna <dig> are among the absolute top ranking candidates . this is a strong indication that our screen in total has an intrinsic capacity to detect adar targets. further, we found one novel substrate for site selective editing to be highly scored. the gabra <dig> transcript coding for the Î± <dig> subunit of the gabaa receptor got a score of  <dig>  this transcript was verified to be edited to 93% using amplicon  <dig> sequencing on rna extracted from the mouse brain  within exon  <dig>  <cit> . thus, the high score in the present computational screen indicates that it is possible to detect novel sites of selective editing using this method. noteworthy is that in previous attempts to find substrates for editing, the gabra <dig> transcript was not detected. the unique feature of our screen compared to others is that we limit our analysis to encoded sequence in combination with rna secondary structure conservation and hallmarks for efficient site selective editing. out of the final list,  <dig> candidates were investigated further. by using the  <dig> sequencing method the sequence of several hundred to a thousand single transcripts can be analyzed and thereby the accuracy in editing efficiency determination is extremely high. altogether, we found editing in  <dig> positions where the a-g discrepancy could not be explained by either sequencing or alignment errors. the top  <dig> sites  are listed in table  <dig>  noteworthy is that five of these come from our explorative screen alone. that is, we detect signs of true editing without the a-g mismatch requirement and exclusively due to extreme conservation traits of our predicted stems. out of those, three sites are located in the orf of neuronal hu proteins b and d -like). the hu family members hub and hud  play important roles in neuronal differentiation and proliferation  <cit> . they consist of three rna binding domains  and have been shown to be involved in rna processing events that regulate expression of nf <dig>   <cit> , ikaros  <cit>  and cgrp   <cit>  in neuronal cells. also, plasticity in snp composition in these genes have been implied in parkinson disease  <cit> . interestingly, in hud the t/a editing site  is situated in rrm  <dig>  and in hub both the i/v and the n/d editing sites are in rrm  <dig>  even though only low levels of editing were detected in hub and hud, one should keep in mind that samples from total brain was used. it is therefore possible that editing in these genes is higher in certain regions of the brain and that it is of importance to achieve a tissue specific regulation of alternative splicing. moreover, since these are neural specific genes, increased levels of editing in non-neuronal tissues might be a way to down regulate these proteins. although further analyses are required, our list of substrates with a low level of editing gives a hint of cell specific gene regulation by rna editing, with one recent exception  <cit> , this type of low level editing has previously not been possible to detect using other methods.

CONCLUSIONS
using our explorative screen in combination with  <dig> sequencing, it is possible to find novel sites of editing within coding sequence at levels that have previously not been possible. our findings also point to a risk in basing an entire screen for a-to-i edited sites on a-g discrepancies between genomic and cdna sequences annotated in the database, since many of the candidates here found to be edited came from the explorative screen alone.
