BACKGROUND
differentiation of the mammalian gonad is a dynamic process which occurs during embryogenesis and continues throughout an individual's life. during this process, both germ and somatic cells acquire sex-specific characteristics. meiosis is initiated at different time points in males and females; female germ cells begin meiosis during embryogenesis while male germ cells do not enter meiosis until puberty. recent findings have indicated that the entry of female germ cells into meiosis is mediated by retinoid responsive genes  <cit> . a second major event in female gonad differentiation occurs when somatic pre-granulosa cells surround individual germ cells to form primordial follicles which constitute a reservoir of oocytes  <cit> , available for subsequent growth and differentiation. this event occurs during fetal life or after birth, depending on the species.

during the last decade, substantial progress has been made in identifying the genes that control the assembly and initial growth of ovarian follicles. different approaches, such as transcriptome analysis of fetal ovaries at different developmental stages and gene inactivation in the mouse, have revealed pathways leading to the formation and differentiation of follicles  <cit> . the transcription of several oocyte-specific genes, such as growth and differentiation factor  <dig>  and bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  commences during early folliculogenesis  <cit> . regulation of these genes is in part due to the expression of two oocyte-specific transcription factors, figla  <cit>  and nobox  <cit> . it has been also shown recently that sohlh <dig> disruption perturbs follicular formation, partly by causing the down-regulation of nobox and figla  <cit> .

in order to identify novel genes involved in follicle differentiation, microarray-generated expression profiles of the mature ovary have been compared with those of newborns, and several novel genes in ovarian development and follicle formation have thus been discovered  <cit> .

by contrast, few genes are known to be related to meiotic prophase i in female mammals. in most cases, meiotic genes were initially discovered in the context of meiotic recombination in yeast. mammalian counterparts were then discovered, predominantly by means of approaches such as gene-targeting in mice and mutational and chromosomal analysis in human patients with fertility disorders  <cit> . the application of microarray technology has enabled the comparison of transcriptional activity in developing male and female gonads at different stages, some of which contain female germ cells in meiotic prophase i  <cit> . more recently, a microarray study compared genome-wide expression in embryonic mouse ovaries, the aim being to identify novel genes associated with early female meiosis, and reported that around  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in e <dig>  mouse ovaries compared with e <dig>  ovaries  <cit> .

another means of isolating differentially expressed transcripts consists in using subtraction techniques. a highly effective method, termed suppression subtractive hybridization , has been applied to generating subtracted cdna libraries of various systems. this method has also been used to isolate ovary-specific genes in several species  <cit> .

in sheep, differences between the somatic components of ovaries and testes are microscopically evident by embryonic day  <dig> . germ cells, however, remain indistinguishable between the sexes until d <dig>  when ovarian germ cells initiate prophase of meiosis  and testicular germ cells arrest in the g0/g <dig> stage of the mitotic cell cycle  <cit> . the structural integrity of ovigerous cords is maintained until d <dig>  at which time primordial follicles first begin to emerge from the interface of the cortex and medulla  <cit> . the maximum number of germ cells present within the fetal ovary of sheep is found at d <dig> . type  <dig> follicles  are first observed at around d <dig>  and in some cases, type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  follicles are present by d <dig>  antral follicles are observed in the fetal sheep ovary at around d <dig>  which is about  <dig> days before parturition  <cit> . few studies have described the expression profiles of genes controlling meiosis and follicular development in sheep  <cit> .

in this study, we report on the generation of two sheep fetal ovary cdna libraries, obtained by applying ssh using mrnas isolated from d <dig> and d <dig> female gonads in the first subtraction d <dig> was used as tester and d <dig> as driver and the forward subtractive library was constructed . in the second one the tester and driver were interchanged and the reverse subtractive library was constructed . these two stages correspond to the onset of meiotic prophase i in female germ cells and primordial follicle formation, respectively.  <dig>  cdna clones were selected and  <dig>  were sequenced from both libraries, then  <dig>  valid sequences were subjected to database searches to annotate the putative functions of the genes thus represented. differentially expressed genes were identified by in silico analysis and rt-pcr. expression analysis confirmed that some of these genes were specifically expressed in fetal ovaries. we further demonstrated that two of the selected ests  were expressed in the female gonad during meoitic prophase i period. furthermore, about 1%  of these ovary-expressing transcripts were novel. they were analyzed for their expression in gonads at different developmental stages. the expression patterns of these  <dig> cdnas were validated by rt-pcr, which enabled the identification of two transcripts with ovary-specific expression.

RESULTS
generation of two ovary stage-specific cdna libraries
messenger rnas isolated from d <dig> and d <dig> fetal ovaries were used to construct two subtractive cdna libraries using ssh. the m  library, supposed to be enriched in cdnas representing genes preferentially expressed during prophase i meiosis, was obtained using cdnas from d <dig> mrnas as the 'tester' and cdnas from d <dig> mrnas as the 'driver'. the f  library was obtained by reversing the 'tester' and 'driver' mrna. sequencing was carried out for  <dig>  cdnas clones selected at random from both libraries:  <dig>  from the m library and  <dig>  from the f library. after removing poor quality sequences, a total of  <dig>  ests from the m library and  <dig>  from the f library were conserved for further analyses . the insert size of the clones ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs, and the average insert size was approximately  <dig> base pairs.

a database named m/f db was generated using all ests from the m and f libraries  <cit> . to generate contigs regrouping identical ests, two successive criteria were applied. the first step built clusters of all  <dig>  sequences from the m/f db and publicly available ovine ests, sharing at least  <dig> bp at an identity rate of 96% using megablast. the second step constructed coherent contigs from the previous clusters using the cap <dig> assembly program  <cit> . this analysis revealed a total of  <dig>  independent contigs  for both libraries,  <dig>  contigs only being found in the m library and  <dig> in the f library . these comparisons resulted in the assembly of  <dig>  independent sequences including  <dig> clusters  and  <dig>  singleton ests . the percentage of unique sequences in each library ranged from 42%  to 73% . this high proportion of sequences represented by single ests seemed to indicate an efficient normalization of the libraries; only  <dig> % of the genes were represented by more than  <dig> ests. furthermore, only  <dig> % of the sequences were represented by ests from both libraries , as expected for libraries that were indeed normalized.

sequence analysis
each sequenced clone was analyzed using the blast program and classified as known, homologous, or novel after its evaluation against entries within the publicly accessible non-redundant ncbi database . known genes were classified as such if homology was high  between the subtracted ssh-generated clones and the ovis aries database: unigene build # <dig>  they accounted for more than 60% in both libraries .

functional annotation of ests
comparison of the  <dig>  sequences from both ssh libraries with the non-redundant protein uniprot/swissprot database revealed that  <dig>  contigs  displayed significant similarity  to existing protein sequences. furthermore, among these  <dig>  contigs, only  <dig> had one go term . these  <dig> sequences fell into the three principal go categories: cellular component, biological process and molecular function. in both libraries, the three most widely represented biological processes were intracellular signaling cascade , cell surface receptor  and dna repair  . however, the small number of go annotated sequences restricted functional annotation of our libraries.

identification of differentially expressed ovary-specific transcripts
in order to evaluate the specificity of the transcripts involved in both the developmental processes studied here, i.e. meiosis and follicle formation, individual library specific ests were studied. a bioinformatics comparison of our ssh library sequences with those published in the literature showed that at least  <dig> genes previously described as being expressed in mice fetal ovaries or adult male meiotic germ cells were present in our libraries. the detection of several genes already known to be expressed during meiosis, such as stk <dig> , smc <dig> , dmrt <dig> , zp <dig> , mutl <dig> , dazl , stathmin , msh <dig>  and msh <dig>  in the m library increased confidence in the quality of the subtraction procedure. in a similar manner, sequences corresponding to the foxo3a , lhx <dig>  and bmp <dig>  genes involved in folliculogenesis were present in the f library.

rt-pcr screening was used to validate in our animal model the ovary-specific expression of several genes previously described in the context of mouse gonad transcriptome analysis. this screening contained  a mixture of cdnas from four different fetal somatic tissues  and  cdna from male and female gonads at two different developmental stages . we examined seven genes from the m library using this mini-profiling procedure, with dmc <dig> as the positive control of the meiotic gene . five genes  produced a band-pattern consistent with the profile expected for a gonad-specific transcript or a predominantly gonad-expressed transcript. three of them  were more strongly expressed in female gonads than in males . in order to confirm their specific expression pattern, tex <dig> was subjected to further real-time quantitative rt-pcr expression analysis on a panel of several fetal stages for each sex. its expression profile appeared to be specific to meiotic prophase i and was similar to typical meiotic genes such as dmc <dig> .

interestingly,  <dig> novel transcripts were also detected in the two libraries. primers were designed for each of them  and rt-pcr analysis was performed using mini profiles . the expression patterns of these  <dig> transcripts were classified into three categories: the first corresponded to transcripts expressed in both male and female gonads and somatic tissues, the second to transcripts specifically expressed in gonads of both sexes, and the third to those specifically expressed in the ovary . transcripts presenting a differential expression pattern between sexes or stages were subjected to real-time quantitative rt-pcr expression analysis . this analysis showed that three transcripts were stage and sex -specifically expressed.

discussion
use of the ssh method to study meiosis and early folliculogenesis
of the different strategies available to study transcriptome variations between two biological situations, suppression subtractive hybridization   <cit>  is an efficient method to identify genes that are differentially regulated. because it includes a normalization step, it enables the isolation of low abundance, differentially expressed transcripts. it does not require previous sequence knowledge, which is an advantage when the genome of the studied species has not been sequenced, and it can be started using pcr-amplified cdnas. it is thus particularly well suited to biological situations such as embryonic or fetal development where specific genes are expressed and tiny amounts of rna are available  <cit> .

the present study aimed to analyze changes in the gene expression profile of sheep ovary during development using the ssh technique. the choice of ssh was based on the assumption that we would be able to discover factors expressed at lower levels than the genes classically detected by microarray techniques, particularly since commercial microarrays are only available for a small number of species that does not include sheep.

m and f cdna-libraries were generated by ssh using mrnas isolated from fetal ovaries at two developmental stages, and a total of  <dig>  ests from both libraries were found to represent a maximum of  <dig>  genes. the level of redundancy in the libraries was approximately 50%.

we used an approach based on the systematic sequencing of ssh products and gene analysis by functional categories. out of the  <dig>  uncommon ests that were cloned during this study, about 82% corresponded to contigs and singletons found to be unique, demonstrating the effectiveness of the experimental design utilized for these ssh libraries. of the two libraries, the one dedicated to meiosis was of better quality than the f library, i.e. it contained more independent contigs , more non redundant contigs  and more singletons .

in total,  <dig>  non-redundant contigs were sequenced and analyzed. nearly all of them presented a unigene nucleotidic annotation  and around two-thirds of the sequences were present in sheep genome databases, while one third presented homology with human or bovine genome databases. these results should be placed in context insofar as in the 99% of sequences with nucleic annotation, a large proportion displayed no protein annotation or possessed a hypothetical or unknown function. major efforts regarding annotation are now necessary in order to improve our understanding of the functional role of these clones.

the cdnas isolated from the m library included several transcripts that had previously been reported to be involved in the meiosis process  <cit> . examples included stk <dig>  <cit> , smc <dig>  <cit> , dmrt <dig>  <cit> , zfp <dig>  <cit> msh <dig>  <cit> , msh <dig>  <cit> , stathmin  <cit> , dazla  <cit> , and mutl <dig>  <cit> . similar data had been observed regarding the f library, with the identification of foxo3a  <cit> , sohlh <dig>  <cit>  and bmp <dig>  <cit> . the detection of previously identified genes supported the validity of our experimental model and the use of ssh as the analytical method. although the utilization of ssh in the current study was successful in identifying previously characterized genes, several expected genes were not present within the target cdna library. among these, stra <dig>  <cit> , dmc <dig>  <cit>  for meiosis genes and bmp <dig>  <cit>  and figla  <cit> , for folliculogenesis genes were not found within our subtracted libraries. the absence of these genes from the libraries may have been due to the use of pcr, and some of the cdnas may not have been amplified as efficiently as others and thus have been lost from the ssh starting material. a similar inability to identify all expected known genes after ssh was recently reported by others and ascribed to incomplete representation of the total cdna repertoire  <cit> . we can also suppose that the plating and sequencing of a larger number of clones could allow isolation of weakly expressed transcripts.

in addition, 1% of the transcripts thus isolated were unknown. they may correspond to additional exons of previously known genes, resulting from differential splicing specific to ovine species or to new genes not yet described . further 5' and 3'race analyses will be necessary to obtain full-length transcripts and to perform other sequence comparisons and functional analysis.

analysis of functional gene ontology
in order to understand the pathways involved in the initiation of prophase i meiosis and follicle formation, go was used to cluster genes according to their biological function. the resulting classification mainly highlighted three biological processes, each representing more than 10% of the contigs taken into account: intracellular signaling cascade, cell surface receptors and dna repair. these results should be modulated by the fact that only 25% of the contigs analyzed displayed go annotation. however, this partial analysis was consistent with the fact that signaling molecules and dna repair proteins are known to be important to regulating germ cell development and meiosis  <cit> .

expressional analysis
rt-pcr analysis of three  of seven selected ests from the m library confirmed their differential expression between males and females. these three transcripts exhibited regulation in the sex, organ and stage from which they were cloned; i.e. female, ovary and meiosis prophase i stage. real-time quantitative rt-pcr analyses of two of them  revealed that they were over-expressed in ovaries from days  <dig> to  <dig> and presented similar patterns to dmc <dig>  a typical meiotic gene. this suggested that the m library contained ests representing genes differentially expressed in meiosis prophase  <dig> period. tex <dig>  initially described as being expressed during adult spermatogenesis, has recently been demonstrated on female meiotic chromosomes in mice  <cit> , findings in agreement with our results. moreover, it is noteworthy that mov10l <dig> transcripts have never been described in female fetal gonads; they were previously described as being expressed in adult testis  <cit> . it is also interesting to note that the expression profile of the ovine pecanex  <dig> gene differed from that described in the mouse  <cit> . it had previously been shown that the mouse pecanex  <dig> transcript was only present in the germ line and not in the somatic cells of the testis, reaching its peak at the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase. however, in sheep, we detected pecanex  <dig> in the fetal testis when male germ cells were not in meiosis.

the expression of unknown transcripts revealed that 20% of them were specific to gonads and 14% to ovary. two of these unknown transcripts from the m library were more strongly expressed in the ovary and not expressed in the testis during fetal life. their expression profiles were similar to those described in the goat for aromatase, activin β genes and 3β hsd  <cit> , with a high level of transcripts at around d <dig> followed by a decline and then a further rise at around d75– <dig>  this similarity of profiles suggests that these unknown genes may be involved in the regulation of steroid production. by refining our methods for sequence homology analysis, we found nucleotidic sequence homology between both cu <dig>  and cu <dig>  and two distinct bovine chromosome  <dig> genomic contigs . no genes have been localized near these homologous regions.

this report also presents a medium scale sequencing of cdnas representing genes in sheep. indeed, of the  <dig>  non-redundant ests selected from the m and f libraries,  <dig> were not reported in the ovis aries est database collection and therefore constituted an unique contribution to the ovis aries est pool. though modest by comparison with databases for some other ruminants, such as cattle, our sequence collection for sheep may serve as a source for comparative studies in the bovids, an animal family of considerable importance to agronomic research.

CONCLUSIONS
using normalized cdna subtraction as a transcript profiling tool to identify differentially expressed transcripts, we isolated several genes that may contribute toward understanding the mechanisms involved in meiosis and ovarian follicle differentiation in a mono-ovulatory species. defects in these two processes are a leading cause of both infertility and birth defects. further analyses of some selected genes in terms of their spatiotemporal expression patterns at the mrna and protein levels in the developing ovarian follicle will be necessary to gain a clearer understanding of their functional roles.

in addition,  <dig> mer oligonucleotides from each of the  <dig> unique ests will be designed and thus constitute a custom-made macroarray dedicated to ovine ovary differentiation. this tool will be used to evaluate modifications to gene expression under various nutritional and environmental conditions and to analyze their impacts on ovarian function.
