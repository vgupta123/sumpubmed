BACKGROUND
retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that transpose via an rna intermediate. they are abundant and widespread components of eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . there are two major types of retrotransposons: long terminal repeat  retrotransposons and non-ltr retrotransposons such as lines  and sines   <cit> . ltr retrotransposons are abundant in plant genomes and can constitute a very large fraction of the host genome  <cit> .

ltr retrotransposons are flanked by ltrs in direct orientation. ltrs are subdivided into u <dig> , r  and u <dig>  regions. regulatory signals such as promoter, terminator regions and polyadenylation sites are found in the ltrs  <cit> . besides the functional importance of these sequences, several studies have reported that the ltrs are the most-rapidly evolving regions of retrotransposons  <cit> .

ltr retrotransposons encode a number of proteins derived from the gag and pol genes, which are usually transcribed as two main mrnas. the proteins in pol are synthesised as a polyprotein that is cleaved by an internal protease activity releasing the internal protein activities endonuclease/integrase, reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease h . the gag gene encodes a protein involved in maturation and packaging of the rna form of the retrotransposon. the life cycle of an element involves transcription by cellular rna polymerase ii, reverse transcription, packaging into virus-like particles, and integration of the cdna copy back into the genome  <cit> .

the retrotransposon tnt <dig>  first characterised in tobacco, is one of the few plant retrotransposons for which transpositional activity has been demonstrated  <cit> . tnt1-like sequences have been detected in several solanaceae and in nicotiana at least three major groups can be differentiated based on u <dig> regulatory region sequence divergence giving rise to tnt1a, b and c subfamilies  <cit> . retrolyc <dig> elements detected in tomato share extensive nucleotide similarities to tnt <dig> elements except in the u <dig> region  <cit> . distinct from tnt <dig>  retrolyc <dig> sequences comprise two subfamilies, retrolyc1a and b, also distinguished at the regulatory u <dig> region  <cit> .

the retrotransposon life cycle results in genome amplification and for this reason their activity is tightly controlled by the host. besides rounds of amplification, host genome size can be scaled down by homologous recombination events within an element or between elements, usually leading to an increase in the copy number of solo-ltr sequences  <cit> . the work presented here aims to address the question of 'how' tnt1-related sequences differentiated in three solanaceae genera  and if there is any evidence for the occurrence of lateral gene transfer. these questions were addressed in a total of  <dig> non-redundant sequences using a population model approach based on recent studies of the amplification of alu sequences among human and chimpanzee lineages  <cit> .

the results presented here demonstrate the existence of tnt <dig> superfamily related lineages in all species studied. sequences analyses corroborate the hypothesis that the tnt1-superfamily has evolved through differentiation of the u <dig> region as previously suggested  <cit> . rnaseh clustering studies revealed the existence of a major representative rnaseh sequence  suggesting the presence of active copies. however, the highly diverse u <dig> region presents inter- and intra-specific diversification, which supports the hypothesis of a rapidly evolving sequence that can be interpreted as a strategy either to evade negative control by the host or to quickly adapt to the new evolving host genome thus contributing to host fitness.

RESULTS
tnt1-like sequences within different solanum species
the presence of tnt1-like sequences within  <dig> wild and cultivated solanum genotypes  was assayed by pcr using primers designed on the tnt <dig> sequence anchored in the terminal part of the ribonuclease h  domain , and on the u <dig> region  spanning part of rnaseh, linker, u <dig>  r and a portion of u <dig> region . fragments of the expected size  were detected in all genotypes analysed . sequence analysis using the ncbi blast tool  <cit>  confirmed that all  <dig> cloned fragments exhibited similarity to the tnt <dig> superfamily and were therefore named "retrosol" to designate them as retrotransposons from solanum. alignment of nine retrosol sequences, chosen randomly from seven distinct species, to tnt <dig> and retrolyc <dig> retrotransposon sequences revealed that the similarity spans the rnaseh, r and u <dig> regions but not u <dig> .

accession means collection, year and locality. x in species name, means hybrid.

note. code refers to the codes use in table  <dig> for each species and cultivars. domestication  status: wild or cultivated  genotypes. total: indicates total number of sequences obtained; unique genotypes: total number of different sequences and percentage; size: average fragment size in bp ; πjc indicates nucleotide diversity with jukes and castor's  correction; i, ii and iii refers to the sequence identity group obtained from the tree presented in figure  <dig> and numbers in these columns indicates numbers of sequences; premature: refers to number of sequences with premature stop codon and no stop/cod: refers to number of sequences with no stop codon in the rnaseh domain.

intra-genotype redundancy was eliminated and only unique sequences within species were considered for further sequence studies . as these species do not have well-characterised genomes, it cannot be determined whether the amplified retrosol fragments represent an unbiased random sample of sequence diversity. however, for a survey of the evolution of this element family, this approach seems appropriate as it was also used previously in the characterisation of the tnt <dig> and retrolyc <dig> families. a few sequences had a premature stop codon and others no stop codon at all in the rnaseh domain .

the nucleotide divergence index , with jukes and castor's correction, was calculated for the full-length fragment sequence within each genotype. numbers range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and allow the genotypes to be classified within three sets . the most diverse displays πjc values ≥  <dig>  and encompassed s. hannemanii, s. kurtzianum and s. okadae species. the second, involving s. acaule, s. megistacrolubom and s. xsucrense, presented values between  <dig>  and  <dig> ; while the third, involving all remaining species had an πjc index of <  <dig> . it is worth pointing out that cultivated potatoes  were in the least diverse group.

phylogenetic relationships of solanaceae tnt1-related sequences
to visualise the relationship between all solanaceae tnt1-related sequences, a phylogenetic analysis was performed using all full-length fragments amplified. retrosol sequences were aligned, together with representatives of tnt1a b and c, and retrolyc1a and b subfamily sequences. three groups were obtained supported by a bootstrap of 98% or higher . group i contains  <dig> sequences, including both wild and cultivated species and all  <dig> sequences amplified from s. brevidens . nucleotide identity between sequences varies from 80–90%. group ii has  <dig> sequences from wild and cultivated species  and nucleotide identity is higher than 90% between sequences. group iii has  <dig> sequences belonging to  <dig> wild species: s. acaule, s. hannemanii, s. kurtzianum, s. okadae and s. xsucrense  with variable nucleotide identity ranging from 60–95%. the tnt <dig> c sequence clusters to group iii while tnt <dig> a, b and retrolyc <dig> a and b form a bridge between groups i and ii and the other sequences.

the πjc index calculated for all unique retrosol sequences was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . considering retrosol phylogenetic groups separately, the nucleotide variability is lower for sequences of group ii , and for group i . group iii has the highest value , probably representing more than one group of related sequences. nucleotide diversity is not uniformly distributed amongst the amplified fragments. when a comparative sliding window for nucleotide diversity is applied on all aligned sequences or within each group, as shown in figure  <dig>  higher substitution rates are seen to be in the u <dig> region. however, when nucleotide diversity distribution was analysed within each group, group ii showed a less diverse u <dig> region compared to the other groups, while group iii sequences exhibited the highest diversity in the u <dig> region. the data support the hypothesis that solanum species harbour at least three versions of u <dig> regulatory regions, although based on previous tnt <dig> superfamily u <dig> divergence studies  <cit> , group iii could represent more than one version.

network analysis of tnt <dig> superfamily ribonuclease h
network approaches have been designed to investigate relationships between closely related sequences, allowing identification of persistent ancestral nodes, multifurcations and reticulations, which are not resolved when applying a conventional phylogenetic package  <cit> . in the network approach, the most-represented identical sequences – named α or master copy – occupy a central position in the net with high numbers of branches suggesting that the sequence represents part of an active element. this approach is based on the parsimony principle, which connects data sets with the minimum number of evolutionary steps. reticulations on the net could result from recombination and/or homoplasy  <cit> .

considering the tnt <dig> superfamily of retrotransposons in the genera solanum, lycopersicon and nicotiana as a population of sequences with a common ancestor, a network study was carried out with the aim of testing the hypothesis that a common α master sequence exists in tnt1-superfamily. the  <dig> nucleotides corresponding to the last portion of the rnaseh coding domain from a total of  <dig> tnt <dig> like-sequences  were used for network analysis. the resulting network  revealed that tnt <dig>  retrolyc <dig> and retrosol did not share any rnaseh sequence as revealed by the absence of shared nodes, although different species within each genus did share a master sequence.

in retrosol sequences, the unique α node observed  represents  <dig> % of all retrosol sequences and encompasses s. hannemanii, s. incamayoense, s. infundibuliforme, s. microdontum, s. megistacrolobum, s. okadae, s. sanctarosae, s. spegazzinii, s. tarijense, s. x sucrense, s. vernei and all s. tuberosum cultivars. it is worth mentioning that  <dig> of the  <dig> α <dig> sequences belong to group ii, which is the least diverse phylogenetic group. moreover, within α <dig> group it was possible to identify identical u <dig> regions belonging to different species and cultivars. a total of  <dig> non-redundant s. brevidens sequences are connected with the α sequence in the net through a nucleotide change. none of the sequences belonging to group iii appear in the α <dig> cluster; group iii sequences are located at a more distant position in the net, suggesting a more distant relationship with the core sequence and probably do not originated from the α <dig> node.

tnt <dig> sequences originated from two α nodes: α <dig> with 24%  and α <dig> with  <dig> %  of tnt <dig> sequences . α <dig> sequences belonged to: nicotiana tabacum, n. debneyi, n. benthamiana, n. plumbaginifolia and n. sylvestris, embracing the three tnt <dig> sub-families . α <dig> clustered sequences from nicotiana tabacum, n. glauca, n. debneyi, n. benthamiana, n. plumbaginifolia and n. sylvestris, grouping tnt <dig> subfamilies a and c. it is interesting to note that tnt1- <dig>  for which transpositional activity has been demonstrated  <cit> , grouped in the α <dig> node.

retrolyc <dig> showed three different α nodes: α <dig> with  <dig> % , α <dig> with 17%  and α <dig> with 13%  of retrolyc <dig> sequences . α <dig> include sequences from lycopersicon pimpinellifolium and l. esculentum – all from the retrolyc <dig> b subfamily. α <dig> has sequences that belong to l. peruvianum and to the retrolyc <dig> a subfamily, while α <dig> has  <dig> sequences that belonged to l. peruvianum and only one from l. hirsutum – all from retrolyc <dig> a. identical u <dig> sequences were shared by different species in the α <dig> node.

other data nodes with different numbers of sequences are connected with the central α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> nodes, suggesting that these members could be active and could contribute to the expansion of each element inside its corresponding genus . the network did not show any excess of multidimensional reticulations so the influence of homoplasy can be considered as negligible  <cit> .

discussion
genome expansion and contraction resulting from rounds of amplification/deletion of transposable elements is becoming accepted as a major component influencing the diversification of eukaryote genomes, as suggested by studies in particular plant and animal species  <cit> . genome sequencing project also shed light on the ancient associations of known transposable element families with plant genomes. for example, in the work described by rossi et al.   <cit> , a phylogenetic study on mutator-like elements  identified in sugarcane revealed the existence of  <dig> mule lineages in angiosperms prior to the divergence of monocots and eudicots.

the retrotransposon tnt <dig> was initially characterised in nicotiana tabacum and then detected by probe hybridisation in other solanaceae genomes  <cit> . ten years later, a new tnt1-like element, retrolyc <dig>  was characterised in lycopersicon peruvianum  <cit> . in this study we report a new family member, retrosol, present in several wild and cultivated solanum genotypes from south america. these results suggest an early association of the tnt <dig> superfamily in the evolution of this plant family .

in addition to its functional importance, the ltr is one of the most rapidly evolving retrotransposon regions. ltrs contain important functional regions such as terminal segments, promoter and enhancer elements, rna processing signals, and it is recognised for the integration process. in the bare- <dig> retrotransposon of barley, the whole ltr is heterogeneous  <cit> , while in tnt <dig> superfamily the variability is targeted specifically to the u <dig> region of the ltr  <cit> . the three subfamilies of tnt <dig> retrotransposons, as well as retrolyc <dig> subfamilies, are also differentiated mainly by the u <dig> region. retrosol sequences present the same structure, showing an accumulation of indels and snps targeted specifically to the u <dig>  thus, the hyper variability of the u <dig> region in the tnt1-superfamily seems to be a general phenomenon of this element's evolution within solanaceae species.

three clades emerged when applying phylogenetic methods to analyse amplified retrosol sequences from solanum sequences. groups i and ii are consistent because they represent cohesive versions of u <dig>  in contrast, group iii encompasses the most diverse sequences, probably due more than one u <dig> version being represented. no correlation is observed between a particular u <dig> version and genotype, wild or cultivated species, or geographical distribution . these results suggest that the amplification and differentiation of retrosol occurred prior to solanum speciation.

a population model was applied in this work to evaluate the relationships among tnt1-derived elements in solanum, lycopersicon and nicotiana with the aim of testing the existence of a unique master copy. to analyse the network results, the three models of expansion proposed by cordaux et al   <cit>  for alu subfamily in humans and primates were considered: the single 'master gene' model, the intermediate model and the transposon model. according to the 'master gene' model, a single α-type element generates all other subfamily members, leading to a star-like relationship with all inactive copies derived from the α element. the contrasting transposon model postulates that all element members can be active in producing new copies, resulting in the lack of a radiation structure from the α central node. the intermediate model suggests that several members are active and contribute to expansion. relationships in this latter model are expected to be partly star-like, but also with different proportions of elements that are not connected directly with the central element depicted as the "α "-sequence.

the rnaseh network supports different models of expansion depending on the element. in addition, rnaseh sequence types, represented by nodes in the net, are distinctive for each genus. retrosol and tnt <dig> show a star-like topology, with the central α node corresponding to the most frequent sequence type, although tnt <dig> presented more than one α node. other nodes not directly connected with the central α node are also found, indicating that the sequence type immediately downstream is also capable of amplification. the unique retrosol α node is represented in  <dig> out of the  <dig> genotypes analysed, taking into account that for most of the other  <dig> genotypes only a few sequences were cloned. in summary, the model of expansion of tnt <dig> in nicotiana sp. and retrosol in solanum sp. best suits the intermediate model. in contrast, retrolyc <dig> present a model with the absence of a radiating structure from a central node and with more than two α nodes, suggesting that many family members are capable of producing new ones. however, these results cannot be used to make conclusions regarding retrolyc <dig> evolution as the sequences used in this study were obtained from only a few species of lycopersicon.

the α <dig> in retrosol encompasses 92% of group ii sequences, representing 50% of the total group ii sample. as mentioned above, group ii presents the least variable u <dig> region , and several group ii sequences amplified from different genotypes have identical u <dig> regions. thus, sequences with identical rnaseh and u <dig> regions transposed prior to the divergence of the host species. this activity is recent enough that element copies should not have accumulated mutations or deletions in the u <dig> variable region. all these lines of evidence point out the protagonist role of group ii in retrosol expansion as the transpositionally active lineage.

rnaseh is conserved in retrosol elements across host species from the same genus, while the u <dig> region has evolved rapidly, in agreement with the concept of modular evolution. the conservation of the rnaseh module at the genus level is related to its biological function, in which the enzyme has to interact with other molecules. rnaseh is involved in degradation of the original rna template, generation of a polypurine track, and final removal of rna primers from the newly synthesised minus and plus dna strands  <cit> . these functions are necessary for the transpositional activity of the element. on the other hand, the u <dig> module evolved rapidly in accordance with its promoter function. new promoter sequences may permit the expression of the element in diverse environmental conditions, increasing the survival potential of the element in the host and/or the probability of overcoming host transcriptional silencing efforts. in addition, the host may gain an advantage in generating genome diversity by insertion of new retrotransposon copies, increasing its own environmental fitness. co-evolution and co-adaptation of retrotransposon with its host genome is expected to play a particularly important role in the long-term survival of these genetic elements  <cit> .

the solanaceae is one of the largest flowering plant families, embracing  <dig> genera. it has a world-wide distribution but the greatest concentration of genera and species is found in south and central america. about three-quarters of these genera and around half of the total number of species are found there; strongly suggesting that the family itself originated in the part of the ancient land mass that later became south america  <cit> . in order to analyse the evolution of the tnt <dig> superfamily, species from three genera were considered: solanum, lycopersicon and nicotiana. solanum is one of the largest genera in angiosperms and accounts for all wild and cultivated tuber-bearing species originating in the high andes of southern peru and northern bolivia. lycopersicon includes the tomato and its wild relatives, which are confined mainly to chile, peru and ecuador. nicotiana encompasses cultivated tobacco and wild species found mainly in south america and australia. these three genera originated in south america but the present species distribution reflects several dispersal phenomena  <cit> . could tnt1-related elements be a determinant in the speciation of the solanaceae?

as proposed by grandbastien et al  <cit> , the composition of present element populations results from the adaptive response of the ancestral tnt <dig> population to different hosts. this adaptive element response refers to appropriate expression patterns, efficient mechanisms of replication and integration, and insertion into non-deleterious genomic sites. ancestral copies exhibiting such adaptive responses were selectively amplified during or after the radiation of solanaceae. on the other hand, non-transcribed copies would have been rapidly inactivated and lost. in retrosol elements, no correlation is found between host species, u <dig> region or rnaseh sequence type, suggesting that diversification of solanum species was not a determinant of this retrotransposon population. similar results have been reported for tnt <dig>  <cit>  and retrolyc <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the use of a population model based on the network approach to evaluate the nature of the association of tnt1-related sequences in solanaceae supports the existence of an ancestral element rather than the occurrence of recent lateral gene transfer. the modular nature of such retrotransposons is clearly demonstrated by the finding that protein functions, represented here by rnaseh, are characterised as slowly evolving sequences, while the u <dig> regulatory region is under a less restrictive evolutionary force. current populations of tnt <dig>  retrolyc <dig> and retrosol most likely result from their vertical transmission in solanaceae. the molecular basis that drives u <dig> differentiation, and whether the rapidly evolving sequence is the result of a strategy to evade host negative control or an attempt to quickly adapt to the new evolving genome and contribute to host fitness, remains to be demonstrated.
