BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  have exponentially increased our knowledge of the genetic component of human disorders, revealing unsuspected loci that harbour variants linked to an increased risk of disease  <cit> . however, the majority of gwas signals fall in non-coding regions of the genome, which has made their functional analysis particularly challenging  <cit> . even the identification of the genes targeted by disease-associated variants is not straightforward, as mere proximity can result in incorrect identification of the culprit gene  <cit> .

atrial fibrillation  is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in humans  <cit>  although its pathophysiologic basis is still not clearly understood, presenting a challenge for cardiovascular research and therapy. af is defined as a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterised by uncoordinated atrial activation, and is frequently observed as a consequence of various systemic and cardiac disorders   <cit> . however, in 10% to 20% of cases af is not associated with other cardiovascular disease, and thus is dubbed ‘idiopathic’ or ‘lone’ af that mostly occurs in patients under  <dig>  the strong association of af onset with risk factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, hypertension and other heart diseases  <cit> , originally suggested it being a non-genetic disorder  <cit> . nevertheless, in the last two decades several epidemiological studies pointed to a significant incidence of genetic factors  <cit> . furthermore, rare mutations in a dozen genes, mostly encoding ion channel subunits  <cit> , are associated with af as part of wider cardiac electrical syndromes.

at least ten loci have been linked to af by gwas in large cohorts of non-related patients of distinct ethnic backgrounds  <cit> . the most highly af associated variants identified in all studies are located on chromosome 4q <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> kilobases  distal to pitx <dig> and within a  <dig>  megabases  intergenic gene desert. pitx <dig> encodes an evolutionarily conserved homeodomain transcription factor that is involved in the establishment of left-right asymmetry and cardiovascular development in the vertebrate embryo. in mice and humans the pitx <dig> gene generates several isoforms. pitx2a and pitx2b are alternative splicing variants produced from a common promoter, whereas pitx2c is the product of an alternative promoter and is the main isoform expressed in the heart  <cit> .

mouse pitx2c is first expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm of the early embryo, as part of the network regulating the establishment of left-right asymmetry during development  <cit> , and is then expressed in the left side of the heart at early stages  <cit> . at later stages, expression follows a dynamic pattern, being present in the left atrium, the myocardium sleeves of the pulmonary veins, the atrio-ventricular cushions or the base of the ventricles  <cit> . germline homozygous deletion of pitx <dig> results in embryonic lethality and numerous cardiac malformations, such as right atrial isomerism and outflow tract defects, varying from double outlet right ventricle or transposition of the great arteries to persistent truncus arteriosus  <cit> . more recent research showed that pitx2c is expressed in adult mice and human hearts, predominantly in the left atrium , and that its levels of expression decrease in atria of af patients  <cit> . furthermore, pitx2c heterozygous or atrial specific deletion of pitx2c display molecular and physiological hallmarks of human af  <cit> , which also is observed when pitx <dig> is deleted in adult mice  <cit> . altogether, these data support the hypothesis that pitx <dig> could play a causal role in the pathogenesis of af and that its function could be altered by genomic elements located in the vicinity of the single nucleotide polymorphisms  in 4q <dig> that correlate with of af.

in this study, we explored whether the 4q <dig> region spanning the af-associated variants identified by gwas harbours putative regulatory elements that could be acting on neighbouring genes. by tissue culture, in vivo transgenics and analysis of chromatin structure, we have found that this region contains potentiator cis-regulatory elements that interact with the promoters of pitx2c and, unexpectedly, enpep, the next gene located downstream of pitx <dig>  given the expression of enpep in the sinoatrial node  and the co-expression of pitx <dig> and enpep in pro-arrhythmogenic regions of the embryonic heart, such as the sleeves of the pulmonary veins, our data suggest that de-regulation of these genes could underlie increased risk of af.

RESULTS
genomic analysis of the 4q <dig> af-associated locus
to identify putative cis-regulatory elements located in the 4q <dig> region we analysed the evolutionary conservation  <cit>  and distribution of histone modifications associated with active elements  <cit>   in an  <dig> kb window containing the main snps that have been associated with an increased risk of af by gwas . this window is centred on the lead rs <dig> snp  <cit>  that has repeatedly been identified as the most significant variant associated with af  <cit> , and spans a region that includes other distal snps  that lie in the proximity of sequences highly conserved between human and mouse . the region including the majority of af-associated snps in 4q <dig> is confined to a linkage disequilibrium  block  <cit> , separated from that containing the coding exons of the gene and from adjacent ld blocks in the  <dig>  mb gene desert located centromeric to pitx <dig> . it is also noteworthy that the selected snps and the pitx <dig> gene are contained together in a single topologically associated domain , as defined by hi-c in three different human cell lines  <cit> .figure  <dig> genomic landscape of the atrial-fibrillation associated region 4q <dig>   a  <dig> kb view of the 4q <dig>  gene desert, showing the position of af risk-associated snps  distal to pitx <dig>  the different pitx <dig> isoforms of the gene are shown above with pitx2c, the main cardiac isoform, on top. below, ucsc tracks of the region showing the distribution of h3k4me <dig> marks  in foetal heart , smooth muscle , foetal liver , foetal brain  and human embryonic stem cells ; the conservation  between human and mouse, rat, cow, opossum and chicken; and the linkage disequilibrium structure from the hapmap project .  a  <dig> kb zoom of the shaded rectangle shown in a  indicating the fragments  tested for regulatory activity in this study. the lead af risk associated snp rs <dig> is highlighted in red. af, atrial fibrillation; ucsc, university of california santa cruz genome browser.



we selected seven genomic fragments  for further analysis . fragments af <dig> and af <dig> lie in close proximity to rs <dig> and show high evolutionary conservation. these fragments are included in a region  tested as part of a large scale screen for tissue specific human enhancers by transgenesis in the mouse embryo  <cit>  and drive reporter expression in the nervous system and limbs but not in the heart. this region was also tested in transgenic zebrafish, driving expression in similar patterns but again not in the developing heart  <cit> . af <dig> to af <dig> are a set of overlapping fragments that include the lead rs <dig> variant and other highly associated snps, in a region with high conservation among placental mammals and h3k4me <dig> marks of active regulatory elements. finally, af <dig> and af <dig> map to a region conserved in vertebrates including rs <dig>  which has been associated with af but is independent of rs <dig>  <cit> .

the 4q <dig> af-associated locus contains active regulatory elements
we tested the regulatory activity of these fragments, corresponding to the none-risk haplotype at rs <dig> from a commercial source of human dna, by linking them to a human minimal beta-globin promoter  <cit>  and the reporter gene coding for monomeric red fluorescent protein   <cit> . these constructs were transfected into cultured hl- <dig> mouse atrial cardiomyocytes  <cit> , a tissue culture model of the physiological conditions in which pitx <dig> is active  <cit> . as a positive control, we used a previously described enhancer from the nppa gene  that recapitulates its endogenous expression in transgenic mice  <cit> ; for negative controls we used the reporter constructs lacking any genomic fragment, and containing the pluripotent-specific oct <dig> distal enhancer  <cit> . of the seven fragments, only af <dig>  which contains rs <dig> , showed significant activity compared with negative controls . while this could seem surprising given that other fragments show a more robust signal for histone modifications associated to regulatory elements , enhancer prediction based on histone marks is only accurate in a fraction of cases  <cit> .figure  <dig> regulatory activity of 4q <dig> genomic elements in cultured hl- <dig> atrial cardiomyocytes and in transgenic mouse embryos.  hl- <dig> transfection assays with the 4q <dig> fragments af <dig> to af <dig> show that only af <dig> exhibits regulatory activity  as compared with the positive  and negative  controls.  transfection assays of af <dig>  to af <dig>  overlapping fragments; only af <dig>   and af <dig>   show significant activity. deletion of the overlapping fragment between them, which itself shows strong activity , abrogates activity of af <dig>   but not of af <dig>  .  af <dig> drives lacz reporter expression in e <dig>  transgenic mice embryos to different sites, such as the facial mesenchyme , limb muscles , and the left gonad .  activity in embryonic day   <dig>  to  <dig>  transgenic embryos of af <dig>   and af <dig>   is highly variable, driving expression in diverse sites, such as the central nervous system  or facial mesenchyme , limb muscles , somites , and heart .  reporter activity driven by the pitx <dig> ase element is preferentially localised to the left side with weak expression in the cardiac region.  the chimeric ase + af <dig>  construct behaves in a similar way to ase but with increased cardiac expression.  sections of the embryos shown in g and h, comparing the region of the right ventricle  of ase  and ase + af <dig>  , which shows a broader domain of reporter expression. similarly, expression in the atrioventricular canal  is broader in ase + af <dig>   compared to ase . for a and b, data are expressed as mean ± sem. statistical significance versus empty pβrfp was calculated by unpaired student’s t-test. *p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> . la, left atrium. ase, asymmetric enhancer; sem, standard error of the mean.



due to the large size of af <dig> , we further analysed its function by generating six overlapping fragments  of  <dig> to  <dig> kb each . when tested in hl- <dig> cells, only af <dig>  and af <dig>  showed activity . it is noteworthy that af <dig> , which contains rs <dig>  is not active in this assay. af <dig>  and af <dig>  overlap in  <dig> base pairs , so we then tested the activity of this minimal fragment  in hl- <dig> cells as well as versions of af <dig>  and af <dig>  where the overlap was removed . af <dig> ∩ <dig>  showed strong activity in hl- <dig> cells, and while af <dig> Δ was not active, af <dig> Δ retained activity although at a reduced level . it is interesting to note that this  <dig> bp minimal fragment is highly conserved between human and mouse, and that its sequence corresponds to a short interspersed nuclear element of the mir <dig> family. it has been shown that repeat sequences can act as enhancers in experimental assays  <cit> , although their putative function in vivo is still under debate  <cit> . therefore, we can conclude that the regulatory activity of af <dig> in this assay is located in af <dig> , and that additional activity may be present in the overlapping fragment of af <dig>  and af <dig> .

next, we assayed the activity of fragments af3- <dig> and af <dig> in transgenic mouse embryos, using the lacz gene as a reporter. again, only af <dig> showed enhancer activity , confirming the results of the tissue culture assays. af <dig> drives reporter expression in facial mesenchyme, limb muscles, and the left gonad, some of which are sites of expression of endogenous pitx <dig>  <cit> . contrary to expectations, af <dig> did not drive expression in the developing heart. we reasoned that regulatory elements from pitx <dig> underlying the association with af might not be active during development, and instead drive cardiac-specific expression of pitx <dig> in the adult. we therefore generated transgenic mice and examined reporter expression in the heart at postnatal day  <dig>  again, we found no expression in cardiac tissues .

when tested in mouse transgenic assays, both af <dig>  and af <dig>  showed activity . sites of expression include facial mesenchyme, limb muscles, somites, or pericardium, but we did not observe a reproducible pattern driven by these fragments. we can rule out the possibility that this heterogeneity is due to non-specific reporter activation as a consequence of integration site of the transgene, because of the very low percentage of lacz positive embryos  obtained for genomic fragments tested showing no activity  as compared to those that do .we also tested activity in transgenic embryos of the minimal af <dig> ∩ <dig>  fragment, finding that it was not active .

the 4q <dig> regulatory elements show non-specific potentiator activity
the above results suggest that these 4q <dig> elements, while they have regulatory potential, do not confer tissue specificity. to test this hypothesis further, we transfected fragments af <dig>  af <dig>  and af <dig>  into two cell types unrelated to the cardiac lineage: the mouse teratocarcinoma-derived pluripotent cell line p <dig> and human embryonic kidney  cells. we found that all three fragments were active in both cell types, closely matching the degree of activation in hl- <dig> cells . as expected, the oct4-de was active in p <dig> but not in hek cells; in contrast, the nppa enhancer was not active in p <dig> but showed activity in hek cells, as expected given the endogenous expression of nppa in human kidney  <cit> . overall, our results suggest that the regulatory elements detected in 4q <dig> do not act as cell type-specific enhancers, but rather as accessory elements that can potentiate the activity of tissue-specific enhancers located elsewhere in the locus.

to further prove the putative potentiator activity of 4q <dig> elements, we assessed the effect of af <dig>  on the activity of a previously identified intronic enhancer from pitx <dig>  which drives left-sided expression in the embryo  <cit> . this asymmetric enhancer  is evolutionarily conserved in sequence and function, but it is noteworthy that the ase from human pitx <dig> only drives weak expression in the mice heart compared with its mouse homologue  <cit> . we generated a chimeric construct containing both human af <dig>  and ase and compared its activity to that of ase alone in transgenic mouse embryos at  <dig>  . we first observed that when using the chimeric ase + af <dig>  construct, the variability associated with af <dig>  alone is lost, and all embryos show the characteristic left-sided expression described for the ase . importantly, we found that there is no additive effect of both genomic fragments as that observed when placing together different enhancers in the same transgenic construct  <cit> . in fact, we observed that adding af <dig>  to the ase apparently increased the levels of reporter expression in the cardiac region , as seen in sections where domains of reporter activity in the right ventricle and in the atrio-ventricular canal are expanded in ase + af <dig>  embryos compared to ase . when we examined in detail reporter expression in the developing heart for all transgenic embryos, we found that af <dig>  increases the number of embryos expressing lacz in the left atrium . the results of these assays further suggest that 4q <dig> elements have an accessory role in defining pitx <dig> expression acting in conjunction with other regulatory elements.

the three-dimensional architecture of the pitx <dig> locus identifies promoter-specific long range interactions
although the above evidence shows that 4q <dig> includes regulatory elements, there is no direct evidence that this genomic region acts on pitx <dig> or that, if it does, it shows any specificity regarding the cardiac and non-cardiac isoforms produced from two alternative promoters. to answer these questions, we analysed the three-dimensional organisation of the locus by chromosome conformation capture   <cit> , to address if these regions physically contact the promoters of pitx <dig>  because we aimed to perform the assays in the physiological context of the heart, we selected the mouse genome region syntenic to human 4q <dig> and analysed chromatin from the atria and ventricles of adult mouse hearts. based on the relative order and position of conserved sequence blocks between human and mouse, we could unambiguously map mouse fragments  equivalent to the human af1-af <dig> fragment series tested above .figure  <dig> long-range chromatin interactions in the mouse pitx <dig> genomic locus.  schematic representation of a  <dig> kb region of the mouse genome syntenic to human 4q <dig>  the approximate locations of regions orthologous to human af1-af <dig> are indicated by pink boxes . the promoter regions from which anchor primers for 3c were generated are indicated . genomic hindiii fragments tested for their interaction with anchor promoter primers are represented by black horizontal bars .  normalised 3c interactions, expressed as crosslinking frequencies , between the test fragments and the promoters of pitx2ab

we probed the interaction of hindiii restriction fragments containing the pitx2a,b or pitx2c promoter with ten fragments spanning over  <dig> kb of the distal region on mouse chromosome  <dig> syntenic to the af-associated 4q <dig> locus in humans . using atria and ventricles from adult mice we observed a clear pattern of long range interactions, with regions interacting specifically with the pitx2a,b promoter , the pitx2c promoter , or with both . the latter result prompted us to ask if fragment 8f had regulatory activity in hl- <dig> cells, since it is not included in any of the previously tested fragments. this was not the case, suggesting that this genomic region has other architectural roles in configuring the regulatory landscape of pitx <dig>  to further examine the specificity of chromatin interaction between the af-associated region and pitx2c, we checked the interaction of a fragment containing the promoter of enpep, the next neighbouring gene distal to pitx <dig> in both mouse and humans . to our surprise, we found a robust interaction between fragment 6f and enpep , suggesting that the 4q <dig> regulatory landscape is partially shared between pitx <dig> and enpep. the specificity of the interactions of fragments 2r, 6f and 8f with pitx2ab, pitx2c and enpep was tested by using a series of control primers located upstream and downstream of the promoters, which showed no interactions .

we next asked if the interactions we observed showed regional differences in atria, as af constitutes a disorder of the left atrium and this is the region where pitx <dig> is prominently expressed  <cit> . while fragment 2r interacted specifically with the pitx2ab promoter in both left and right atrium, fragment 6f interacts only in left atrium with pitx2c and enpep. on the other hand, fragment 8f shows interaction with pitx2c in both atria but only in the right atrium with enpep . given the fact that the promoters of pitx2c and enpep share many of the interactions tested, we examined if they were physically associated and if this was region-specific. we found a robust and specific promoter-promoter interaction in both atria and in ventricles , therefore independent of transcription and in line with recent observations on the role of pre-existing promoter-promoter interactions for structuring the genome  <cit> .figure  <dig> differential chromatin interactions of pitx <dig> and enpep in left and right atrium.  normalised 3c interactions, expressed as crosslinking frequencies , between fragments 2r, 6f and 8f, and the promoters of pitx2ab, pitx2c and enpep, in left  and right  atrium.  3c interaction between the pitx2c and enpep promoters, including control regions upstream  and downstream  of enpep , in left  and right  atrium, as well as in ventricles . in each graph, the highest crosslinking frequency values were set to  <dig>  statistical significance was assessed following one-way anova test of student-newman-keuls. *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> . error bars represent ± sem. anova, analysis of variance; sem, standard error of the mean; 3c, chromosome conformation capture.



it should be noted that fragment 6f contains the region conserved with human fragment af <dig>  thereby suggesting that the region with regulatory activity and that contains the lead snp associated with af  interacts in a specific manner with the promoters of the cardiac-specific isoform of pitx <dig> and the neighbouring gene, enpep. the 3c analysis of the mouse pitx2/enpep locus thus revealed an unexpected complexity of specific and shared chromatin interactions between the regions containing the potentiator elements and the different promoters studied that could be related to their function.

enpep is expressed in arrhythmogenic sites in the embryonic heart
enpep encodes aminopeptidase a, which cleaves angiotensin ii to produce angiotensin iii as part of the renin-angiotensin system  <cit> . therefore enpep is involved in the control of blood pressure, and accordingly it is expressed in the renal system and endothelial cells, and knockout mice for enpep develop hypertension  <cit> . however, at present there is no report for expression or a role of enpep in the heart. in light of our results, we examined the expression of enpep in the e <dig>  mouse embryos by in situ hybridization on tissue sections . enpep is strongly expressed in the endothelial lining of the lungs, but also in a specific and restricted pattern in the developing heart . we compared enpep expression with that of pitx <dig>  and hcn <dig> , which encodes a voltage-gated ion channel and at this stage is a marker of most of the cardiac conduction system  <cit> . this analysis showed that enpep is co-expressed with pitx <dig> in the pulmonary veins but not in the myocardium of the left atrium , and is co-expressed with hcn <dig> in the left and right superior venae cavae and in the san . enpep is thus expressed in the embryonic mouse heart in key components of the cardiac conduction system such as the san. moreover, enpep is also expressed at the base of the pulmonary veins and the junction of the caval veins, regions prone to initiate ectopic electrical beats, which lead in many cases to the onset of af  <cit> .figure  <dig>

discussion
the advent of gwas has radically changed our perspective on the genetic analysis of common diseases in humans. on the one hand, a plethora of novel loci linked to increased disease risk have been uncovered, which await further analysis before possible translation to the clinic  <cit> . on the other hand, the vast majority of risk variants are located in non-coding genomic sequences, pointing to a fundamental role for variation in cis-regulatory elements as the basis of common diseases  <cit> . understanding the role and function of these genomic elements will be fundamental to making the most of the discoveries of gwas.

the genomic analysis of af is a prime example in this regard. all gwas carried out to date have shown that the major loci for af lie in an intergenic gene desert in 4q <dig>  located distal to the developmental regulator pitx <dig>  <cit> . despite its early role in establishing the left-right patterning of the heart and its prominent expression in the left atrium, no evidence suggested a role for pitx <dig> in the pathophysiology of af  <cit> . subsequent analysis of loss-of-function mouse models of pitx <dig> have confirmed that it plays a pivotal role in regulating different atrial phenotypes by distinguishing electrical from working myocardium in the right and left atria respectively  <cit> . however, no reports to date have provided evidence as to how distal variants in 4q <dig> act on pitx <dig>  even more surprisingly, a recent report showed that 4q <dig> variants do not correlate with pitx <dig> expression in atrial tissue from human patients  <cit> . this evidences that variants identified by gwas may have extremely subtle effects, which fall below the threshold of detection of current analytical tools and approaches.

our analysis of the regulatory structure of the 4q <dig> locus shows that genomic sequences in close proximity to af-linked variants can act as transcriptional regulatory elements both in tissue culture and in mouse embryos. rather unexpectedly, and contrasting with other cases of gwas-related enhancers in the cardiovascular system  <cit> , these elements are not specific to cardiac cell types, either in culture or in vivo. the 4q <dig> elements show equal activity when transfected into cell types of different origin. furthermore, in transgenic mouse embryos these elements drive highly variable patterns of reporter expression. these results suggest that the cis-regulatory elements in 4q <dig> do not act as classical tissue-specific enhancers, but as potentiator elements that would act in cooperation with elements located elsewhere in the locus that dictate tissue restricted expression. in the case of mouse pitx <dig>  an intronic enhancer  has been described that drives left-side specific expression in the early embryo and later in the heart, liver and other organs  <cit> . it is conceivable that precise control of spatial and quantitative expression of pitx <dig> requires interplay of the ase and the 4q <dig> potentiator. in fact, when placed together and tested by transgenics, the variability of 4q <dig> elements is lost and it can modulate the activity of ase. it is possible that this potentiator could also modulate the activity of other yet to be identified regulatory elements from the locus.

by analysing the physical interaction between promoters and intergenic sequences of the mouse region syntenic to 4q <dig>  we have found a further degree of complexity in the chromatin structure of the region. first, there is a clear specificity in the interaction of distal elements with the alternative promoters of the different pitx <dig> isoforms, despite their being separated by less than  <dig> kb. in this regard, it is noteworthy that the region containing the potentiator activity we have described interacts specifically with the promoter of the cardiac-specific pitx2c isoform. furthermore, this interaction occurs specifically in the left atrium. these results provide additional support to the specific role of the region identified by gwas in regulating pitx <dig> in the heart.

more surprising was the fact that this same region physically interacts with the promoter of enpep, the neighbouring gene located distal to pitx <dig>  this opens the possibility that enpep could also be a transcriptional target of the identified cis-regulatory elements. enpep, as part of the renin-angiotensin system, has been shown to control blood pressure, and hypertension is a known risk factor for af  <cit> . however, 4q <dig> variants are associated with lone af, with no co-occurrence of hypertension  <cit> , and independent variants located in the proximity of enpep but not in the 4q <dig> af loci are associated with changes in blood pressure  <cit> . furthermore, there is no reported correlation between expression of enpep and 4q <dig> variants in the blood or adipose tissue  <cit> . we can therefore conclude that the possible regulation of enpep by the 4q <dig> potentiator elements would be unrelated to its known role in the control of blood pressure. our re-evaluation of enpep expression in the developing mouse heart by in situ hybridization reveals co-expression with pitx <dig> in the pulmonary veins, a region with pro-arrhythmogenic potential  <cit> , and in the san of the right atria, a key component of the cardiac conduction system where the electrical impulse is generated. our preliminary observations suggest that incorrect regulation of enpep in these locations could be linked to af. the precise role of enpep in the heart remains to be identified and could offer novel insight into the pathogenesis of af.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that novel cis-regulatory elements are located in the region of 4q <dig> associated with an increased risk for af. these elements establish complex long-distance interactions with the promoters of both pitx2c and enpep, and therefore could regulate the transcription of these genes. a potential limitation of our study is the fact that while we have used human genomic dna for regulatory assays, the chromatin structure of the pitx2/enpep locus and the expression of enpep in the heart was carried out in mouse. however, the sequence conservation in the regions studied, as well as conserved synteny of the locus and of gene functions strongly suggests that regulatory mechanisms will also be conserved between human and mouse. overall, our results suggest that de-regulation of either one or both pitx <dig> and enpep might have a causal role in the development of af. future work will be needed to identify the causal variants and the upstream regulatory factors that act through the potentiator elements described here.

our study also highlights the challenges we face in the functional analysis of genetic variation identified by gwas. our understanding of the nature and function of non-coding genomic elements is still incomplete, despite the wealth of genome-wide data available through encode and similar projects  <cit> . we are greatly limited by the breadth and specificity of available assays to interrogate the function of a dna fragment. we can hypothesise that only a fraction of gwas hits will represent classical tissue-specific enhancers, whose characterisation is feasible with current tools. many cases will affect other regulatory elements with not such a clear-cut and easily identifiable role in gene transcription, such as potentiators or modulators , but also silencers, insulators or stabilisers. novel tools and assays will need to be devised to fully understand the regulatory variation underlying common human disease.
