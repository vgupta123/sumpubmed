BACKGROUND
mitogen activated protein kinases  respond to a wide array of external signals, and are presumed to be present in all eukaryotes. cellular proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses are all regulated by mapks  <cit> . the well characterized mapks function as part of a signaling module in which a mapk kinase kinase  phosphorylates and thereby activates a mapk kinase , which then phosphorylates and activates the mapk. upon activation, mapks phosphorylate targets in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, and at the cell cortex  <cit> .

because mapks affect targets throughout the cell, their localization is a critical aspect of signal regulation  <cit> . in fact, mislocalization of mammalian erk mapks has been associated with altered signaling  <cit> . moreover, the duration of erk nuclear localization has been reported to be very important in determining the outcome of erk activation: proliferation vs. differentiation  <cit> . immunofluorescence and gfp-tagging experiments have demonstrated that pathway stimulation causes some mapks to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus  <cit> . although nuclear accumulation of mapks has been studied in model systems, the mechanisms that regulate this phenomenon are not fully understood.

a priori, the nuclear localization of mapks can be regulated in two ways: 1) regulated import or export across the nuclear membrane; 2) release from cytoplasmic tethers  and/or sequestration by nuclear tethers. thus far, there are four examples of mapks that are subjected to active transport. in mammals, erk <dig> interacts directly with the nuclear pore complex and undergoes ran-dependent nuclear import  <cit> , whereas erk <dig> and erk <dig> are actively exported from the nucleus by the crm <dig> exportin  <cit> . in budding yeast, the hog <dig> mapk undergoes both ran- and nmd5-dependent nuclear import, as well as crm1-dependent nuclear export  <cit> . a number of reports also suggest that tethers influence the localization of mammalian mapks. mek is thought to be a cytoplasmic tether for erk1/ <dig>  for example  <cit> . when erk is activated, it releases from mek, allowing erk to localize to the nucleus. pea- <dig>  hsef, the mkp- <dig> dual-specific phosphatase, and the tyrosine phosphatases heptp and ptp-sl have also been reported to be cytoplasmic tethers for erks, and β-arrestin is thought to anchor erk to endosomal vesicles  <cit> . as yet, dusp <dig> is the only protein reported to tether erks in the nucleus  <cit> . in the budding yeast s.cerevisiae, the ptp <dig> phosphatase and the msn <dig>  msn <dig>  and hot <dig> transcription factors act as nuclear tethers for the hog <dig> mapk, whereas the ptp <dig> phosphatase and the pbs <dig> mek tether hog <dig> in the cytoplasm  <cit> . also in budding yeast, spa <dig> retains the mpk <dig> mapk at sites of polarized growth  <cit> . finally, the atf <dig> transcription factor of s.pombe has been shown to regulate the nuclear localization of the spc1/sty <dig> mapk  <cit> .

to better understand the mechanisms controlling mapk localization, we are using the mating reaction of s.cerevisiae as a model signaling system. when haploid yeast cells of opposite mating type are mixed, they undergo a complex mating reaction leading to the formation of zygotes. each mating type constitutively secretes a peptide mating pheromone that triggers cells of the opposite type to arrest in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, form mating projections , and induce mating-specific genes in preparation for cell and nuclear fusion. the signal to mate is transmitted across the plasma membrane by a seven transmembrane domain receptor and its associated heterotrimeric g protein. upon release from gα , the gβγ dimer binds to the ste <dig> scaffolding protein and stimulates a pak kinase. these proteins, in turn, are required for activation of the map kinase cascade. the map kinase module consists of ste <dig> , ste <dig> , and fus <dig> . upon activation by ste <dig> on the ste <dig> scaffold, the fus <dig> mapk accumulates at its sites of action  <cit> . in the nucleus, fus <dig> phosphorylates the ste <dig> mating-specific transcription factor  <cit> , its two negative regulators, dig <dig> and dig <dig>  <cit> , and a regulator of cell division, far <dig>  <cit> . at the cortex, fus <dig> is thought to phosphorylate bni <dig>  <cit>  and gβ  <cit> .

in proliferating cells, fus <dig> is found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with a slightly greater concentration of fus <dig> in the nucleus  <cit> . upon pheromone stimulation, the relative proportion of fus <dig> in the nucleus increases. to quantify this pheromone-induced nuclear accumulation of fus <dig>  we developed an assay that measures the relative amount of fus <dig> in each compartment  <cit> . digital images of cells expressing a fus3-gfp reporter were used to determine the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence . using this assay, we confirmed that pheromone induces a measurable accumulation of fus <dig> in the nucleus, and found that this increase in nuclear fus <dig> correlates with the responsiveness of cells to pheromone. cells that are resistant to pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest have lower rncf values; cells that are hypersensitive to pheromone arrest have higher rncf values. moreover, the relative amount of fus <dig> in the nucleus decreases as cells adapt to pheromone stimulation and re-enter the mitotic cycle. these results demonstrate that, although the changes in fus <dig> localization during the induction and downregulation of the pheromone response are small , they are of great consequence to the cell. it is therefore of interest to determine what regulates the partitioning of fus <dig> between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  and fluorescence loss in photobleaching  analyses, van drogen and co-workers found no evidence that the rate of fus <dig> transport either into or out of the nucleus is regulated by pheromone  <cit> . rather, they concluded that fus <dig> rapidly shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm by passive diffusion. if the rate of fus <dig> transport across the nuclear membrane is not regulated by pheromone, then what causes the accumulation of fus <dig> in the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells? one possibility is that the activation of fus <dig> alters its affinity for cytoplasmic and nuclear tethering proteins. consistent with this, fus <dig> dissociates from the ste <dig> scaffolding protein in the cytoplasm when it is phosphorylated by ste <dig>  <cit> . combining this mechanism with an increased tendency to bind tethers in the nucleus could account for the observed signal-induced change in fus <dig> localization.

here we report that three proteins known to interact with fus <dig> in the nucleus  contribute to its pheromone-induced redistribution. our data suggest that dig <dig> and dig <dig> are nuclear tethers for fus <dig>  and that ste <dig> influences fus <dig> localization either by directly interacting with it, or by transcribing genes whose protein products are fus <dig> tethers. we also provide evidence that the phosphorylation state of fus <dig> is a key determinant of its localization, and that the msg <dig> phosphatase regulates fus <dig> localization by dephosphorylating it in both the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. this work supports the idea that the activation of mapks changes their affinity for anchoring proteins in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, thereby effecting their signal-induced redistribution.

RESULTS
dig <dig> and dig <dig> are required for the normal accumulation of fus <dig> in the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells
dig <dig> and dig <dig> are nuclear proteins that are known to interact with both the inactive and active forms of fus <dig>  with results from pull-down, two-hybrid, and peptide array binding experiments suggesting that these interactions are direct  <cit> . they negatively regulate the pheromone pathway by binding non-overlapping regions of ste <dig>  <cit> , a transcription factor essential for the expression of mating-specific genes  <cit> . to determine whether either dig <dig> or dig <dig> affects the nuclear localization of fus <dig>  we measured the cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of fus3-gfp in wild-type, dig1Δ, and dig2Δ cells. the distribution of the reporter was not significantly different in the three strains during vegetative growth . in response to pheromone treatment, however, the wild-type cells exhibited a significantly higher concentration of fus <dig> in the nucleus as compared to the mutant cells . these data suggest that dig <dig> and dig <dig> contribute to the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> during the mating response, but either do not affect the localization of fus <dig> in vegetative cells, or are functionally redundant in this regard.

because the effect of dig1Δ and dig2Δ on fus3-gfp localization is only detectable after pheromone treatment, and because pheromone treatment induces the phosphorylation/activation of fus <dig>  we wondered whether dig <dig> and dig <dig> specifically affect the localization of the phosphorylated form of fus <dig>  in stimulated cells, the pheromone-responsive mek, ste <dig>  phosphorylates fus <dig> on two residues, t <dig> and y <dig>  <cit> . to determine the effect of fus <dig> phosphorylation on its putative nuclear tethering by dig <dig> and dig <dig>  we used a mutant form of the fus <dig> reporter that cannot be phosphorylated by ste <dig>  fus3t180ay182a-gfp  <cit> . the mutant reporter localized normally in vegetative wild type cells, but was defective in pheromone-induced nuclear accumulation . significantly, dig1Δ and dig2Δ had no measurable effect on the localization of the fus3t180ay182a-gfp reporter . the insensitivity of fus3t180ay182a-gfp localization to deletion of dig <dig> and dig <dig> suggests that dig <dig> and dig <dig> primarily tether the phosphorylated form of fus <dig>

ste <dig> overexpression confers hyper-accumulation of fus <dig> in the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells
the ste <dig> transcription factor is required for the induction of many mating-specific genes  <cit> . it localizes to the nucleus  <cit>  and, based on two-hybrid and biochemical data, is known to directly interact with fus <dig>  <cit> . therefore, like dig <dig> and dig <dig>  ste <dig> might be a nuclear tether for fus <dig>  to examine this possibility, we asked whether overexpression of ste <dig> affects the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig>  we did not test the effect of ste12Δ on fus <dig> localization because ste <dig> is essential for normal activation of the pheromone pathway. a plasmid containing ste <dig> under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter was transformed into wild type cells carrying the fus3-gfp reporter. galactose-induced overexpression of ste <dig> did not affect fus3-gfp localization in vegetative cells . however, when ste <dig> overexpression was induced concomitant with the addition of pheromone, the pheromone-stimulated rncf was significantly greater than in the control cells . thus, excess ste <dig> causes hyper-accumulation of fus3-gfp in the nuclei of pheromone-treated but not untreated cells. to determine whether this effect depends on the phosphorylation of fus <dig>  we repeated the experiment in cells expressing the fus3t180ay182a-gfp reporter. as shown in figure  <dig>  overexpression of ste <dig> had no effect on fus3t180ay182a-gfp localization , consistent with the idea that ste <dig> augments the nuclear tethering of activated fus <dig> .

msg <dig> affects the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> by dephosphorylating it in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus
msg <dig> is a pheromone-inducible, dual-specific phosphatase known to dephosphorylate and thereby inactivate fus <dig>  <cit> . we have previously shown that overexpression of msg <dig> lowers the amount of fus <dig> found in the nucleus of vegetative cells  <cit> . in stimulated cells, excess msg <dig> completely blocks the pheromone-induced nuclear accumulation of fus <dig>  conversely, deletion of msg <dig> confers hyper-accumulation of fus <dig> in the nucleus  <cit> . although these experiments strongly suggest that msg <dig> affects the localization of fus <dig>  they do not tell us how. a priori, msg <dig> could mediate its effect on fus <dig> by tethering it in the cytoplasm and/or by dephosphorylating it on either side of the nuclear membrane. to investigate these possibilities, we first asked where msg <dig> itself is located. an msg5-gfp reporter was constructed and shown to be functional by its ability to compliment an msg5Δ allele in pheromone-response assays . in vegetative cells, msg5-gfp appeared to localize uniformly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, and this pattern was unchanged after pheromone treatment . to determine whether the putative nuclear fluorescence was due to the presence of msg5-gfp within the nucleus, and not simply around it, we compared cells expressing the msg <dig> reporter to those expressing ptp3-gfp. ptp <dig> is a tyrosine phosphatase that inactivates fus <dig> and its sister mapk, hog <dig>  <cit> . the ptp3-gfp reporter has been shown to localize exclusively to the cytoplasm  <cit> . as shown in fig. 3a, there is no detectable fluorescence in the nuclei of cells expressing ptp3-gfp. this demonstrates that our imaging system can discern equal nuclear and cytoplasmic localization from purely cytoplasmic localization. together, these results suggest that msg <dig> is distributed evenly in both compartments, and that its localization does not change upon pheromone treatment.

given the apparent distribution of msg <dig> throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, the effect of msg <dig> on fus <dig> nuclear localization can be explained in either of the two ways described above: msg <dig> might tether fus <dig> in the cytoplasm, just as ptp <dig> is thought to tether hog <dig>  <cit> . alternatively, dephosphorylation of fus <dig> by msg <dig> might alter its affinity for anchoring proteins on either side of the nuclear membrane. of course, these possibilities are not mutually exclusive.

to separate the potential abilities of msg <dig> to regulate fus <dig> by tethering and dephosphorylation, we created a phosphatase-dead form of the enzyme, msg5c319a. the c319a substitution in msg <dig> has been shown to specifically disrupt the catalytic activity of the phosphatase  <cit> . we then compared the localization of fus3-gfp in wild-type cells and cells overexpressing either msg <dig> or msg5c319a. excess msg5c319a lowered the basal rncf as effectively as an excess of wild type msg <dig> . in contrast, msg5c319a was handicapped in its ability to regulate fus <dig> localization in cells responding to pheromone: although excess msg5c319a lowered the induced rncf, the pheromone-stimulated nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> was not completely blocked, as was the case in cells overexpressing wild-type msg <dig> . this suggests that the phosphatase activity of msg <dig> is required for proper regulation of fus <dig> localization during mating.

does msg <dig> inhibit the pheromone-induced change in rncf by dephosphorylating fus <dig> in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or both? to answer this question, we fused either the nuclear localization signal  of the sv <dig> t antigen  <cit>  or the nuclear export signal  of hiv- <dig>  <cit>  to the n-termini of msg <dig> and msg5c319a, preserving the native msg <dig> promoter sequences. because the msg <dig> message has an alternate translational start site at codon  <dig>  <cit> , we also engineered m45a substitutions in both constructs, thereby ensuring that all of the msg <dig> protein encoded by the hybrid genes is n-terminally tagged. the resulting constructs are designated nls-msg5m45a, nes-msg5m45a, nls-msg5m45ac319a, and nes-msg5m45a c319a. all are contained on centromeric  plasmids.

to determine the efficacy of the nls and nes tags, we fused gfp to the c-termini of nls-msg5m45a, nes-msg5m45a, nls-msg5m45ac319a, and nes-msg5m45a c319a. cells transformed with nls-tagged msg <dig> reporters exhibited dramatic nuclear concentration of the gfp signal, similar to that seen in cells expressing a gfp-tagged form of the nuclear phosphatase, ptp <dig> . rncf measurements indicated that about 80% of the gfp-reporter signal was localized in the nuclei of cells expressing both nls-msg5m45a-gfp and nls-msg5m45ac319a-gfp. cells transformed with nes-tagged msg <dig> reporters exhibited dramatic cytoplasmic concentration of the gfp signal, similar to that seen in cells expressing a gfp-tagged form of the cytoplasmic phosphatase, ptp <dig> . rncf measurements of the nes-tagged reporters indicated that approximately 70% of the reporter was localized to the cytoplasm.

by transforming an msg5Δ fus3-gfp strain with various pairs of the nls-tagged and nes-tagged msg5m45a and msg5m45ac319a centromeric plasmids, we sought to determine how fus <dig> localization would be affected by loss of msg <dig> phosphatase activity in one compartment or the other. three strains were created: the nes-msg5m45a/nls-msg5m45a cells express enzymatically active msg <dig> in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus; the nes-msg5m45ac319a/nls-msg5m45a cells express msg <dig> in both compartments, but little or no phosphatase activity in the cytoplasm; and the nes-msg5m45a/nls-msg5m45ac319a cells express msg <dig> in both compartments, with little or no phosphatase activity in the nucleus. because all of the msg <dig> alleles are expressed from the native msg <dig> promoter, all are carried on low-copy plasmids from the ycplac series  <cit> , and all were transformed into the same msg5Δ strain, the level and partitioning of msg <dig> is very unlikely to vary significantly amongst the three strains in question. these three strains should differ only in where msg <dig> is enzymatically active. as shown in table  <dig>  the basal rncf values were not significantly different in the three strains, suggesting again that msg <dig> phosphatase activity does not play a major role in regulating the localization of fus <dig> in vegetative cells. in contrast, the pheromone-induced rncf values were elevated in cells lacking full msg <dig> phosphatase activity in either the cytoplasm or nucleus. this suggests that msg <dig> negatively regulates the pheromone response by inactivating fus <dig> both inside and outside of the nucleus.

we have previously established that the relative amount of fus3-gfp in the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells correlates with sensitivity to pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest  <cit> . to determine whether the deficiency of msg <dig> phosphatase activity and the consequent increase in the induced rncf also corresponds to heightened sensitivity to pheromone, we performed halo tests. compared to our wild type control strain, the three nes-msg5/nls-msg <dig> strains all formed smaller halos that were partially filled in with pheromone resistant colonies , a phenotype consistent with overexpression of msg <dig>  <cit> . however, the three experimental strains were not equally responsive to pheromone in the halo tests. the cells deficient in cytoplasmic msg <dig> activity  were more sensitive to pheromone-induced growth arrest than the cells with full msg <dig> activity in both compartments , and the cells deficient in nuclear msg <dig> activity  were the most sensitive of all. this suggests that although msg <dig> regulates pheromone-responsiveness in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, the nuclear pool of msg <dig> has a greater impact on the cell's sensitivity to pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest. these observations also strengthen the correlation between higher rncf  and greater cellular responsiveness to pheromone.

discussion
mapk signaling modules are designed to relay signals originating at the plasma membrane to nuclear targets. this is accomplished by the phosphorylation and activation of the mapk in the cytoplasm, followed by its accumulation in the nucleus. the signal-induced redistribution of the mapk drives the nuclear responses, whereas these responses attenuate as the level of active mapk in the nucleus declines. the kinetics with which mapk nuclear activity rises and falls determines both the degree of response and, in some cases, the type of response  <cit> . for example, the decision of rat pc <dig> cells to proliferate or differentiate into neurites is thought to be controlled by how long erk remains active in the nucleus after stimulation  <cit> . clearly, the localization of mapks, like their enzymatic activity, must be tightly regulated.

like erk1/ <dig>  the mating-specific fus <dig> mapk of yeast regulates a developmental switch between proliferation and differentiation. pheromone signaling increases the concentration of active fus <dig> in the nucleus, which causes cell cycle arrest and induces the morphogenic changes necessary for efficient mating. the results reported by vandrogen et al.  <cit>  suggest that fus <dig> diffuses freely into and out of the nucleus, at a rate unaffected by pheromone. if pheromone has no effect on the rate of fus <dig> movement, then how does it increase the level of nuclear fus3?

active fus <dig> may be tethered by its nuclear substrates
one way to explain the pheromone-induced accumulation of nuclear fus <dig> in the absence of regulated transport is differential tethering: activation of fus <dig> could cause it to dissociate from cytoplasmic tethers  and bind to nuclear tethers. although our experiments do not directly measure the level of active fus <dig> in either compartment, our data are consistent with the idea that fus <dig> is tethered by its nuclear substrates. dig <dig> and dig <dig> are substrates of fus <dig>  and each interacts directly with fus <dig> in the nucleus. deletion of either dig <dig> or dig <dig> conferred a defect in the accumulation of fus <dig> in the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells but, even though dig <dig> and dig <dig> bind to the inactive form of fus <dig>  <cit> , had no significant effect on the nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of fus <dig> in vegetative cells . it is unlikely that the aberrant localization of fus <dig> in pheromone-treated cells is due to a loss of fus <dig> function, as dig1Δ and dig2Δ are reported to have no effect on fus <dig> activity  <cit> . therefore, the simplest explanation for our results is that dig <dig> and dig <dig> enhance retention of the phosphorylated/activated form of fus <dig> in the nuclei of mating cells. alternatively, deletion of dig <dig> and dig <dig> could affect the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fus <dig> indirectly by altering the expression of ste12-regulated genes. fus <dig>  msg <dig>  and dig <dig> are all known to be upregulated by ste <dig>  <cit> .

another potential nuclear tether for fus <dig> is the ste <dig> transcription factor. ste <dig> is a substrate of fus <dig> and the two proteins directly interact in the nucleus. we found that overexpression of ste <dig> significantly increased the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> but not of fus3t180ay182a-gfp in pheromone-treated cells , as would be expected if ste <dig> specifically tethers the activated form of fus <dig>  it has been reported, however, that pheromone-treatment substantially diminishes the fus3-ste <dig> association, as assayed by co-ip  <cit> . therefore, we favor the idea that ste <dig> overexpression affects the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> indirectly, by hyper-inducing the expression of other nuclear tethers. dig <dig> could be one such downstream tether, as its transcription is induced by pheromone  <cit> . indeed, deletion of dig <dig> lessened the effect of ste <dig> overexpression on fus <dig> localization, although the difference between the rncf data sets was not quite statistically significant . unfortunately, we were not able to directly assess the effect of ste12-induced transcription on fus <dig> rncf because the available transcription- alleles of ste <dig> all contain large deletions, which could disrupt ste12-fus <dig> interaction. we conclude that ste <dig> contributes to the retention of fus <dig> in the nuclei of mating cells either by direct interaction with activated fus <dig> or, more likely, by inducing the expression of other fus <dig> nuclear anchoring proteins.

the msg <dig> phosphatase regulates fus <dig> localization
the dual-specific msg <dig> phosphatase inactivates fus <dig> by removing the phosphates on residues t <dig> and y <dig>  in earlier work, we reported that overexpression of msg <dig> had a dramatic effect on fus <dig> localization: excess msg <dig> lowered the relative amount of nuclear fus <dig> in vegetative cells and completely blocked its pheromone-induced nuclear accumulation  <cit> . our discovery that msg <dig> localizes homogenously to both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm  is consistent with several means by which msg <dig> might limit the pool of nuclear fus <dig>  msg <dig> could sequester fus <dig> in the cytoplasm, and/or it could dephosphorylate fus <dig> in either or both compartments. to distinguish these possibilities, we examined the effects of altering msg <dig> activity and localization on fus3-gfp partitioning. we found that overexpression of msg5c319a, an enzymatically dead form of the phosphatase, lowered the basal rncf as effectively as the overexpressed wild type enzyme . this indicates that msg <dig> can sequester fus <dig> in the cytoplasm. however, we do not believe that msg <dig> tethering of fus <dig> greatly influences fus <dig> localization, as the fus3:msg <dig> protein ratio is about 16: <dig> in vegetative cells, and the pheromone-induction of fus <dig> transcription is slightly greater than that of msg <dig>  <cit> .

a potentially more important finding is shown in table  <dig>  as compared to excess wild type msg <dig>  overexpressed msg5c319a was clearly defective in its ability to inhibit the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> in pheromone-treated cells. this implies that msg <dig> phosphatase activity regulates the partitioning of fus <dig> in mating cells. given that msg <dig> is overexpressed from the strong gal <dig> promoter in these experiments, however, the extent to which dephosphorylation of fus <dig> by msg <dig> affects the localization of the kinase under physiological conditions was unclear. we were also interested to know whether fus <dig> inactivation could be specifically attributed to the nuclear msg <dig> phosphatase activity, as the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of msg <dig> could play distinct roles in fus <dig> regulation. to address these questions, we constructed a set of three strains designed to express the same total amount of msg <dig> in each compartment, but which are distinguished by whether they express msg <dig> phosphatase activity in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, or both. although msg <dig> appears to be at least slightly overexpressed in these strains, as indicated by the halo tests , the msg <dig> levels are presumed to be more nearly normal than in the cells expressing msg <dig> from the gal <dig> promoter . in essence, these strains allow us to ask what happens to the localization of fus <dig> when msg <dig> phosphatase activity is specifically turned off in either the nucleus or cytoplasm, while holding the total amount of msg <dig> constant. our data indicate that fus <dig> hyper-localizes to the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells lacking msg <dig> phosphatase activity in either compartment . in contrast, loss of msg <dig> phosphatase activity had no effect on the partitioning of fus <dig> in vegetative cells . these results strongly suggest that dephosphorylation/inactivation of fus <dig> is an important means of regulating its localization in cells responding to pheromone, and that msg <dig> performs this function in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

consistent with our previous results  <cit> , the hyper-accumulation of fus <dig> in the nuclei of msg <dig> phosphatase-deficient cells correlated with increased sensitivity to pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest: the halos formed by cells lacking msg <dig> phosphatase activity in the nucleus or cytoplasm were larger and less filled than those formed by the control cells . interestingly, loss of nuclear msg <dig> phosphatase activity conferred a slightly more sensitive halo phenotype than loss of msg <dig> phosphatase activity in the cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclear msg <dig> has a greater impact on fus <dig> regulation of the cell cycle than the cytoplasmic pool of the phosphatase.

a limitation of these msg5-partitioning experiments is that we did not directly measure the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of the various msg <dig> forms. although such measurements could strengthen our conclusions in principle, immunoblot-quantification of msg <dig> after cell fractionation would not be sufficiently precise to be meaningfully correlated with the rncf differentials that we observed. a priori, it is possible that the m45a or c319a substitutions in msg <dig> could decrease its half-life. however, flandez et al. have shown that myc-tagged msg5m45a is no less stable than the myc-tagged wild type protein  <cit> , and the results of our fus3-gfp localization assays argue strongly against the possibility that the c319a mutation destabilizes msg <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  overexpression of msg5m45ac319a has the exact same impact on the basal rncf as does the overexpression of msg <dig>  and expression of nes-msg5m45ac319a instead of nes-msg5m45a had no effect on the basal rncfs. . finally, even if we suppose that the steady-state level of nls-msg5m45ac319a is lower than that of nls-msg5m45a, we would expect to find this difference in all the strains analyzed for fig.  <dig> and the bottom section of table  <dig>  instead of concluding that the msg <dig> phosphatase activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus inhibits pheromone-induced fus <dig> nuclear localization, we would conclude simply that both cytoplasmic and nuclear msg <dig> inhibits pheromone-induced fus <dig> nuclear localization.

nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of fus3–a switch and a timer
considering our results with those of others, pheromone-induced nuclear accumulation can be explained quite simply as follows: fus <dig> diffuses freely into and out of the nucleus at a rate that is unaffected by pheromone  <cit> . when the cell is exposed to pheromone, fus <dig> is phosphorylated by ste <dig>  which causes it to shift to its active conformation. activation of the kinase triggers its dissociation from ste <dig>  <cit> , while increasing its affinity for its nuclear targets. the interaction of fus <dig> with its nuclear targets then retards its diffusion out of the nucleus. in short, fus <dig> accumulates in the nucleus of pheromone-treated cells as the result of signal-induced changes in cytoplasmic and nuclear tethering. fus3/ste12-induced transcription of nuclear tethers  would be expected to further increase the retention of fus <dig> in the nucleus, thus creating a positive feedback loop. the fact that the absence of dig <dig> or dig <dig> did not affect the basal rncf or completely inhibit the pheromone-induced increase in the rncf suggests that there are other proteins involved in the nuclear tethering of fus <dig> 

our results also suggest that msg <dig> antagonizes the nuclear localization of fus <dig>  by removing the activating phosphates on fus <dig>  msg <dig> decreases its affinity for its nuclear tethers. in addition to promoting adaptation to pheromone and return to the ground-state partitioning of fus <dig> after cell fusion, this mechanism may play an important role in regulating the mating response. looking at the system as a whole, the primary job of the mapk is to report the status of the membrane-bound receptor to the nucleus. as long as fus <dig> remains active, the cell is insensitive to changes in receptor signaling. msg <dig> limits the duration of fus <dig> activity, thereby ensuring that the kinase periodically re-associates with the ste <dig> scaffold, where it receives updates about the upstream elements in the pathway. thus, msg <dig> is a timer. by continually reversing the fus <dig> activation switch , msg <dig> sharpens the temporal connection between the stimulus and response.

if the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> is due to pheromone-induced tethering, as we suggest, then the flux of fus <dig> from the nucleus to cytoplasm of cells responding to pheromone should decrease. why was this change undetected when vandrogen et al. tried to measure it? most likely, the decrease in fus <dig> "export" due to induced nuclear tethering is too small to be observed by frap analysis. the error in their measurement  is much greater than the rate change in fus <dig> movement out of the nucleus that we would expect to see, assuming the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> is linear over time.

another prediction of our model is that a mutant form of fus <dig> that cannot be phosphorylated should be unable to accumulate in the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells. indeed, the induced rncf of the fus3t180ay182a-gfp reporter is significantly lower than normal . on the other hand, pheromone treatment of wild type cells expressing fus3t180ay182a-gfp does induce some increase in rncf. if the phosphorylation of fus <dig> is essential to its nuclear tethering, then why does the fus3t180ay182a-gfp reporter accumulate in the nuclei of pheromone-treated cells at all? one possibility is that fus3t180ay182a-gfp dimerizes with wild type fus <dig>  and these heterodimers are retained in the nucleus by a subset of fus <dig> targets. in support of this explanation, fus <dig> interacts with itself in the two-hybrid assay  <cit> , and the erk mapks are known to dimerize in response to stimulus  <cit> . although we have not tested fus <dig> dimerization directly, one of our previously published observations is consistent with it: pheromone induces the nuclear accumulation of the fus3t180ay182a-gfp reporter in cells expressing either fus <dig> or kss <dig> , but not in cells lacking functional copies of both these mapks  <cit> . alternatively, the phosphorylation of fus <dig> may be necessary for its efficient tethering by some nuclear proteins , but not others. in this view, the pheromone-induced nuclear accumulation of fus3t180ay182a-gfp would require expression of functional fus <dig> or kss <dig> because tethering is augmented by the mapk-dependent phosphorylation of some fus <dig> anchoring proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that phosphorylation of fus <dig> augments its ability to interact with nuclear tethers, which explains the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> observed after pheromone pathway activation. additionally, the msg <dig> phosphatase counteracts the nuclear accumulation of fus <dig> by dephosphorylating it in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. the continual dephosphorylation of fus <dig> throughout the cell may enhance the temporal sensitivity of the pheromone pathway, thereby promoting a rapid adjustment of signalling intensity in response to changes in the pheromone gradient.
