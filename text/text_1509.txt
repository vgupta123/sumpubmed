BACKGROUND
gwas analysis generally yields large quantities of test results. global and local graphical viewing of the test results is an effective approach and often is a necessary step for interpreting gwas results. a widely used graphical viewing of gwas results is the manhattan plot, which provides a global graphic view of gwas results of all chromosomes for a trait on one graph to quickly identify genome locations with the most significant snp effects  <cit> . following this global view, detailed graphical examination of each chromosome is helpful for further understanding the gwas results, and more graphical work often is needed for effective presentation of the gwas results. the purpose of the snpevg package is to provide a graphical tool for rapid digestion of gwas results and to accomplish large quantities of graphical tasks of gwas analysis in a seamless fashion.

implementation
the snpevg computer package is implemented in the c++ programming language. the object orientation feature of the c++ language enables the efficient software development cycle by easy reuse of modules for different applications with similar features. the snpevg computer package used the qt library under the terms of the gnu lesser general public license  version  <dig>  as shown  <cit> .

RESULTS
snpevg version  <dig>  includes three graphical programs: snpevg <dig>  snpevg <dig> and snpevg <dig>  snpevg <dig> is for graphing effects of one trait per graph for up to  <dig> traits, snpevg <dig> is for graphing multiple traits on the same graph, and snpevg <dig> processes directly uses an output file of episnp or episnpmpi  <cit>  as the input file. both snpevg <dig> and snpevg <dig> using the same format of the input file, which contain name, chromosome number and chromosome position of each snp marker, and p-values of statistical tests from any method. each program has a scalable gui allowing efficient and flexible use of computer screen and allows the production of graphical images with user defined vertical/horizontal ratios. each program can be launched multiple times by mouse click of the executable program so that the user can compare graphical effects of different graph options simultaneously. snpevg  <dig>  is available from additional files  <dig> and  <dig> or from the website at http://animalgene.umn.edu. full features of the snpevg package are described in the snpevg user manual  <cit>  additional file  <dig> 

the snpevg <dig> program
snpevg <dig> supports a maximum  <dig> traits. the gui  has numerous graphical options for manhattan plots, including user-customized colors , shading p-values below the threshold p-value line , and scalable pixel size proportional to p-values  <cit>  , and displaying p-values above the specified cut-off p-value . each manhattan plot uses true chromosome size defined by the starting and ending snp marker positions of the chromosome. p-values for the unknown chromosome are displayed in sequential order of snp markers rather than chromosome positions. manhattan plots and q-q plots  provide global view of test results for each trait. in addition to global viewing, the gui produces graphs for each chromosome and each trait. for each chromosome, p-values can be presented as connected lines  or separate symbols . the total number of graphs that can be generated is n, where n is the number of ‘traits’ with  <dig> < n ≤  <dig>  and c is the number of chromosomes. assuming  <dig> traits and  <dig> chromosomes per trait, the program produces  <dig> graphs for interactive viewing by one click of ‘run’, including  <dig> manhattan plots,  <dig> q-q plots and  <dig> chromosome graphs. the upper-right window of the gui  is the ‘graph list’ by trait, showing a list of graphs produced by the ‘run’ button. the user can turn off manhattan and q-q plots, scroll the chromosome graphs of each trait using the up or down arrow key, and switch between traits using the left or right key. any selected graph, or graphs for selected traits, or all graphs can be saved as graphical images with publication quality by clicking a button on the gui. snpevg <dig> requires a simple text input file with the following columns: chr, position, snp, and p-value columns, where chr = chromosome number, position = chromosomal position of the snp marker, snp = name of the snp marker, and p-value is the p-value for a trait.

the snpevg <dig> program
snpevg <dig> is designed to display p-values of multiple traits on the same graph. each chromosome figure can display p-values in log scale or the original values of a variable on either y <dig> or y <dig> axis  . the y <dig> axis can be used to display a variable unrelated to p-values such as minor allele frequency or allele frequency difference between the best and worst individuals, allowing the production of more flexible and informative graphs than using y <dig> axis presenting p-values only. the chromosome graphs can be crowded and difficult to view if the number of traits is large. this problem can be solved by the option to select traits to display, to customize the color of each trait or switch y <dig> and y <dig> axes using the ‘setting’ button on the gui . each y axis, y <dig> or y <dig>  can have its own threshold p-value or cut-off p-value . snpevg <dig> requires a simple text input file with the same format as for snpevg <dig>  i.e., chr, position, snp, and p-value columns, where chr = chromosome number, position = chromosomal position of the snp marker, snp = name of the snp marker, and p-value is the p-value for a trait.

the snpevgconvert program
the snpevgconvert program is designed to convert an output file from any gwas analysis software to the format of snpevg <dig> and snpevg <dig>  with this format conversion program, virtually any gwas software could snpevg <dig> and snpevg <dig>  to use this program, the user only needs to specify the number of columns in the original files and identify the column numbers to be printed in the input file for snpevg <dig> and snpevg <dig> 

the snpevg <dig> program
snpevg <dig> is developed for graphical analysis of gwas using the output file of single-locus test results of episnp or episnpmpi  <cit>  as the input file for drawing figures. snpevg <dig> has similar gui features as snpevg <dig>  but it does not have the limit of  <dig> traits. this program draws graphs for p-values of additive, dominance and genotypic effects on the y <dig> axis and draws sample size on the y <dig> axis. the p-values can be displayed with lines connecting adjacent data points  or use symbols without connecting lines . the user has an option to draw a figure by a sorted effect such as additive or dominance effect.

evaluation of sample size limitations
currently, snpevg <dig>  snpevg <dig> and snpevg <dig> have a microsoft windows 32-bit version and a 64-bit version for mac os x  <dig>  or newer. a windows 64-bit version is expected to become available at a later time. for practical purposes, either the 32-bit or the 64-bit version would be powerful enough for real gwas data sets. for a single trait, the 32-bit version could process  <dig> million markers per trait in about  <dig> seconds but failed for  <dig> million markers, and the 64-bit version could process  <dig> million markers in  <dig>  seconds . for multiple traits, the number of markers that can be processed per trait is approximately the numbers in table  <dig> divided by the number of traits .

the 32-bit version was run on a desktop pc with microsoft windows  <dig> and intel core i7- <dig> cpu of  <dig>  ghz and  <dig> gb memory. the 64-bit version was run on the macbook pro with mac os x  <dig>  and intel core i <dig> cpu of  <dig>  ghz and  <dig> gb memory.

CONCLUSIONS
the snpevg package is a versatile and efficient graphical tool for rapid digestion of large quantities of test results from gwas and can be customized for graphical viewing and drawing of non-gwas information such as allele frequency differences.
