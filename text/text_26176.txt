BACKGROUND
the production of virulence factors in staphylococcus aureus is coordinated by a network of two-component systems, global regulators and transcription factors, allowing optimal adaptation of the pathogen to a changing environment and stress conditions encountered during the various stages of infection. a central regulatory element of virulence factor production in s. aureus is the accessory gene regulator agr, a two-component quorum sensor regulating gene expression in a growth-dependent manner. the main effector molecule of the agr operon is the regulatory rnaiii  <cit> , which is responsible essentially for the upregulation of secreted proteins in the post-exponential phase. rnaiii transcription is enhanced by the staphylococcal accessory regulator sara  <cit>  and reduced by the alternative sigma factor σb in strain newman  <cit> . sara is a winged helix transcription factor influencing many virulence genes  <cit> . the transcription of sara in turn is directly activated by the alternative sigma factor σb  <cit> , which controls over  <dig> genes including virulence factors and secondary regulators in a direct or indirect way  <cit> . indirectly σb-controlled genes lack a σb consensus promoter sequence, and are thought to be controlled by secondary, σb-dependent regulatory elements. the yabj-spovg operon, with spovg as effector molecule, is besides sara one of the directly σb -dependent secondary regulators  <cit> . spovg contributes to methicillin and glycopeptide resistance, stimulates capsule synthesis, and was recently shown to regulate a small σb-subregulon comprising mainly excreted virulence factors including the highly upregulated virulence factor esxa  <cit> .

secretion of virulence factors is facilitated by several translocation systems in s. aureus  <cit> , the major sec pathway, the accessory sec <dig> system  <cit> , the twin-arginine translocation pathway  <cit> , and the type vii-like specialized esx secretion pathway   <cit> . the ess system comprises a cluster of at least nine genes: esxab, essabc, esaabc and esad  <cit>  and secretes proteins with a size of approximately  <dig> amino acids containing a helical structure and a conserved trp-xaa-gly  motif  <cit> . three proteins were so far shown to be exported by the staphylococcal ess system, two wxg <dig> family proteins, esxa and esxb, and the non-wxg <dig> substrate esac  <cit> . all three proteins act as pathogenicity factors in a murine model of staphylococcal blood-borne dissemination and abscess formation  <cit> . the actual role of esxa, esxb and esac remains unclear. structural analysis of esxa suggests a role as transport module or chaperone to assist export of proteins by the ess secretion pathway rather than being an effector protein itself  <cit> . the esxa gene seems to be under complex control. besides being upregulated by spovg  <cit> , esxa was found to be upregulated by arlr  <cit> . the two-component system arlrs  <cit>  itself is activated in an indirect way by σb in strain newman  <cit> , adding a further level of complexity in the regulation of esxa.

this study analyses the transcriptional control of esxa by σb and the σb-dependent regulatory elements sara, arlr, rnaiii and spovg.

RESULTS
transcriptional analysis of esxa
the  <dig> bp esxa gene , coding for a small secreted protein involved in staphylococcal virulence, is the first of at least nine genes of the ess gene cluster encoding the type vii-like esx- <dig> secretion pathway  in s. aureus   <cit> . although esxa seems to belong transcriptionally to the ess gene cluster  <cit> , transcriptional profiling produced one single esxa-specific transcript with a size of about  <dig>  kb appearing in early growth phase after  <dig> h and increasing slightly within time . no esxa-specific signals were detected in the corresponding Δesxa mutant bs <dig>  confirming the esxa deletion. the deletion of esxa had no polar effects on the expression of the downstream ess genes, nor on the divergently transcribed gene directly upstream of esxa, predicted to be involved in staphyloxanthin synthesis  <cit>  . our results suggest that esxa is located on a monocistronic transcript and is not co-transcribed with the remaining genes of the ess gene cluster.

esxa promoter and terminator sequence analysis
in a microarray of strain newman, esxa transcription was found to be upregulated by the σb-controlled yabj-spovg operon  <cit> . searching the nucleotide sequence upstream of the esxa orf for potential σa   <cit>  and σb   <cit>  consensus promoter sequences and for a ribosomal binding site   <cit> , we identified  <dig> bp upstream of esxa a putative σa promoter , and  <dig> bp upstream of esxa a potential σb promoter . a proposed ribosomal binding site  was located  <dig> bp upstream of the esxa start codon . fourteen bp downstream of the esxa stop codon we identified a putative rho independent terminator consisting of a  <dig> bp inverted repeat with a minimal free energy Δg of - <dig> kcal/mol as calculated by mfold  <cit> .

primer extension analysis located the transcriptional start point  of esxa  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon of esxa . it was preceded by the predicted - <dig> and - <dig> σa promoter elements, and further up by the σb promoter.

to verify and compare the function of the putative σa and σb promoter sequences, we cloned the esxa promoter region upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene and analyzed the luciferase activity of this construct, pesxap-luc+, as well as of constructs containing either a deletion of the σa or σb promoter . whereas the relative luciferase activities of pesxap-luc+ and pesxapΔσb-luc+ after  <dig> h of growth were comparable, pesxapΔσa-luc+ showed almost no activity, suggesting that esxa possesses a σa-dependent promoter . we could rule out a direct involvement of σb in the control of the esxa promoter, furthermore, by testing the esxa upstream region in the heterologous two-plasmid system that was established to identify σb-dependent s. aureus promoters  <cit> . the upstream region of esxa was cloned into the reporter plasmid psb40n resulting in plasmid pesxap which then was introduced into e. coli dh5α containing either pac7-sigb, expressing the s. aureus sigb gene from an inducible promoter, or the empty plasmid pac <dig>  if the s. aureus σb - e. coli rna polymerase core enzyme hybrid recognized the esxa promoter, dark blue colonies would be expected on the indicator lbacx-ara agar  <cit>  in combination with pac7-sigb, as with the σb-dependent promoters of asp <dig> or yabj ; if not, uncolored colonies would be expected, as with the σb-independent promoter of capa or the empty psb40n . in contrast, transformants containing the empty pac <dig> vector should produce uncolored colonies. however, both combinations, pesxap with either pac <dig> or pac7-sigb, developed an identical only light blue color in e. coli dh5α, indicating that the esxa promoter was recognized weakly by an e. coli rna polymerase, but that the observed transcriptional activity was independent from σb . overall, the results of the esxa promoter and terminator sequence analyses supported a monocistronic transcription of esxa from a σa-dependent promoter.

effect of σb and σb-controlled spovg on esxa expression
to differentiate between the effect of σb and of the σb-controlled yabj-spovg on the transcriptional control of esxa, we followed the luciferase activity of the esxa promoter-reporter fusion in pesxap-luc+ during the growth cycle in parental strain newman, the corresponding Δrsbuvw-sigb mutant , and in the Δyabj-spovg mutant . the luciferase activity increased in the parent newman in a growth phase dependent manner from the exponential towards the stationary phase and declined thereafter . the course of luciferase activity in the Δyabj-spovg mutant sm <dig> and in the Δrsbuvw-sigb mutant ik <dig> was comparable but the overall activity was reduced by a factor of two in sm <dig>  whereas it was two up to four times higher in ik <dig>  these effects were also mirrored by the intensity of the esxa specific transcripts . since esxa transcription in strain ms <dig>  <cit> , a mutant with a stop in sigb inactivating σb, was indistinguishable from that in ik <dig>  we could assign the upregulation of esxa transcription to the loss of σb and exclude any contributions of rsbuvw .

to determine if either yabj or spovg inactivation was responsible for the reduction of esxa transcription, we complemented newman, sm <dig> and ik <dig> in trans with a series of plasmids expressing constitutively either yabj , spovg , or yabj-spovg , circumventing the requirement of σb to transcribe the yabj-spovg operon. northern blot analysis revealed that the constructs containing spovg or yabj-spovg, but not the one carrying yabj, did restore the esxa transcription to wild type level in sm <dig> . in ik <dig>  showing stronger esxa transcription signals than the wild type, the esxa transcription was even further enhanced by the complementation with pspovg or pyabjspovg, confirming that spovg, but not yabj, had a positive effect on esxa expression in presence and absence of σb. however, the fact that esxa transcription was strongly induced in ik <dig> lacking not only σb, but consequently also the σb-dependent spovg, suggested that esxa transcription may be activated by spovg but repressed by other σb-dependent factors.

influence of major regulators sara, rnaiii and arlr on esxa
as σb and spovg had opposite effects on esxa expression, we searched for further σb-dependent regulators that might be involved in esxa control, namely the two major regulators of s. aureus, the agr system with its effector molecule rnaiii; and the transcriptional regulator sara. a further candidate was arlr, the response regulator of the arlrs two-component system, reported to be activated by σb in strain newman, and promoting together with spovg capsule formation  <cit> . the transcript intensity of esxa in newman compared to that in its isogenic Δsara , Δagr  and Δarlr  mutants during growth, revealed a strong upregulation of esxa in lr <dig>  a downregulation in ks <dig> and an even stronger attenuation in sm <dig> , suggesting that sara acts as repressor, and rnaiii and arlr as activators of esxa transcription. this was confirmed by the level of luciferase activity of pesxap-luc+ during growth, which was highly increased in the Δsara mutant , and lower in the Δagr  and almost absent in Δarlr  mutants compared to the wild type newman . interestingly, as in capsule synthesis, spovg and arlr acted as elements enhancing the esxa expression  <cit> .

influence of esxa on regulatory elements and itself
esxa itself had no influence on the signal intensity or activity of any of the above regulatory genes, neither on asp <dig>  as an indicator of σb activity  <cit> , nor on spovg, arlr, sara or rnaiii, when comparing their expression in strain newman and in the Δesxa mutant bs <dig> during the growth cycle . we could also rule out any autoregulatory effects of esxa on its own transcription, since luciferase activity patterns of pesxap-luc+ were congruent over the entire growth cycle in newman and bs <dig> .

influence of sara, rnaiii, σb, arlr and spovg on each other
an overview of the regulatory network influencing esxa transcription is given in figure  <dig>  including also the mutual interactions of the different regulators: σb activity was found to be comparable in all strains tested, excluding secondary effects on esxa transcription due to an altered σb activity . we confirmed the previously reported positive influence of σb on arlrs and yabjspovg transcription  <cit> , as well as on sara transcription  <cit> . in contrast, we could not detect any major changes in rnaiii transcript intensity in σb mutants, although some studies suggest that σb activity is reducing the rnaiii level  <cit>  .

further, minor changes in transcription were observed in the Δsara mutant where rnaiii was downregulated and arlr transcripts were slightly upregulated, and in the Δarlr mutant where sara transcription was increased . however, these dependencies could not explain the changes in esxa transcription in the corresponding mutants.

phenotypic characteristics of the Δesxa mutant
the successful deletion of esxa reported here, and the superimposable growth rates of wild type and esxa mutant in complex lb medium, confirmed that esxa was not essential for growth in vitro . the growth defects observed in sigb and arlr mutants, the former affecting late  <cit>  and the latter reducing early growth stages  <cit> , can therefore also not depend on altered esxa expression. although σb and spovg are known to influence extracellular proteolytic activities  <cit> , and σb is known to repress hemolytic activity in s. aureus  <cit> , esxa did neither affect proteolytic nor hemolytic activities in bs <dig> . as the activity of the sigma factor σb and the σb-controlled spovg positively influences methicillin and glycopeptide resistance in methicillin resistant s. aureus  and in glycopeptide intermediate resistant s. aureus   <cit> , we deleted esxa in mrsa strain bb <dig>  <cit>  and gisa strain nm <dig>  <cit> . however, resistance levels of the Δesxa mutants bs <dig> and bs <dig> to oxacillin and teicoplanin, respectively, were identical to those of the parent strains, when measured by etest , as well as by antibiotic gradient plates, which allow the detection of very small differences in resistance . these results suggest that esxa, which enhances abscess formation in mice and is thought to act either as transport chaperone or adaptor protein  <cit> , primarily plays a role as extracellular virulence factor in pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that the repression of esxa by σb is due the σb-induced transcription of sara, leading to a strong and dominating sara-mediated repression of esxa. the activation of esxa transcription, on the other hand, is stimulated by the agr quorum sensing system, the response regulator arlr, and the effector protein spovg; whereby arlr is controlled indirectly, and spovg directly by σb. thereby the activating effect of arlr seems to be more profound than the effect of spovg and agr. moreover, virulence gene regulation in s. aureus is very complex and additional factors might contribute to the regulation of esxa transcription.

the mode of function of spovg, named after the stage v sporulation protein g in bacillus subtilis  <cit> , and spovg homologues in other bacterial species is yet unknown, nor have any spovg interacting partners been reported. spovg does not affect σb activity as seen from the expression of asp <dig>  which is a measure of σb activity in s. aureus. spovg does also not interfere with the transcription of sara, arlrs nor agr in strain newman.

by which mechanisms spovg counteracts the postulated sara-mediated repression of esxa remains open. the affinity of sara binding to dna can be enhanced by phosphorylation  <cit> , but a postulated interaction of spovg with sara or other proteins has yet to be investigated. interestingly, the same stimulating effect by arlrs and spovg is seen in s. aureus capsule synthesis  <cit> . we therefore can not rule out that spovg and arlr may interact or have some common target. spovg by itself seems also to enhance transcription of esxa when artificially overexpressed in a sigb mutant. the absence of predicted dna binding motifs in spovg may not fully exclude its interaction with nucleic acids or with factors involved in transcription. in conclusion, we have presented here spovg, an interesting new player in the regulatory cascade modulating s. aureus virulence factors.
