BACKGROUND
matrix metalloproteinases  are protein-digesting enzymes that are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. genes encoding mmps have been cloned from several plant species including soybean, cucumber and the model legume medicago trunculata, and have also been identified in sugarcane  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, a family of five very similar intronless mmp genes has been identified  <cit>  encoding proteins with the same characteristic domain structure as animal mmps  <cit> . this comprises an n-terminal signal peptide, a propeptide including a cysteine switch motif, and a zinc-binding region with the conserved sequence hexghxxgxxh followed by a methionine turn motif. four of the arabidopsis mmps are predicted to integrate into the plasma membrane via a c-terminal hydrophobic helix, while the presence of an uncleavable signal peptide suggests the remaining family member resides in the er lumen.

although the natural substrates of plant mmps are unknown, they play important roles in a variety of physiological processes including senescence  <cit> , pathogen defense  <cit>  and growth and development  <cit> . very recently an mmp-like protein from m. trunculata  has been shown to be involved in the establishment of symbiotic interactions with sinorhizobium meliloti  <cit> . in this case the protein's function might not depend on proteolytic activity since it has an amino acid substitution in a normally conserved position within the catalytic domain.

mmps are usually expressed at low levels in a variety of tissues but are strongly induced under certain conditions. the levels of soybean smep <dig> and arabidopsis at2-mmp mrna in leaf tissue increase in line with the age of the plant  <cit>  and cs1-mmp mrna levels in cucumber increase sharply after the onset of senescence in cotyledons and leaves  <cit> . gmmmp <dig> mrna in soybean is induced by certain types of stress, including wounding, dehydration and infection with the oomycete pathogen phytophtora sojae or the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea  <cit> . at3-mmp mrna in arabidopsis is induced > 30-fold  <dig> minutes after exposure of seedlings to the p. syringae derived flg <dig> peptide  <cit> .

here we describe the cloning of a tobacco mmp gene from tobacco by- <dig> suspension cells and functional analysis of the encoded product, ntmmp <dig> using zymographic assays on artificial substrates. we determined the subcellular localization of ntmmp <dig> using a fluorescent reporter protein, and analyzed the expression profile during normal fermentation and after challenge with bacterial pathogens. structural and functional differences between ntmmp <dig> and the well-characterized vertebrate mmps are discussed.

RESULTS
cloning the ntmmp <dig> cdna
degenerate mmp primers were designed by reverse translation of the conserved zinc-binding motif in the collection of plant mmp sequences in the genbankÂ® database. these were used to amplify mmp cdna sequences from by- <dig> cell total rna in combination with an oligo primer. a putative partial mmp sequence was identified by sequencing several of the cloned pcr products and completed by amplification of the 5'-end of the cdna using specific primers. the complete cdna was  <dig> bp in length and contained an open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding a 365-amino-acid mmp named ntmmp <dig> .

the ntmmp <dig> protein sequence contained all the components found in other mmps, including a signal peptide , a potential propeptide  containing a cysteine switch motif , a putative peptidoglycan binding motif , two zinc-binding sites , a methionine turn motif , a potential transmembrane domain, and seven potential n-glycosylation sites. according to the merops classification of proteases  <cit> , ntmmp <dig> belongs to the m10a subfamily of plant matrixins. ntmmp <dig> is closely related to at2-mmp, at3-mmp and at5-mmp from a. thaliana with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity at the amino acid sequence level, respectively. figure  <dig> shows ntmmp <dig> aligned with other plant mmp sequences described in the literature.

subcellular localization of ntmmp1
in silico analysis using interproscan  <cit>  and psort  <cit>  predicted that ntmmp <dig> is targeted to the secretory pathway and integrated into the plasma membrane via a c-terminal 17-amino-acid hydrophobic domain. to test this prediction, the catalytic domain of ntmmp <dig> was exchanged with the sequence for emerald gfp , a variant of the green fluorescent protein  <cit> . tobacco by- <dig> cells were stably transformed with this construct and the localization of ntmmp1-gfp was analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy.

by subculture day  <dig>  confocal analysis revealed clear labeling of the plasma membranes but no significant staining in other cell compartments . additional staining of the er was observed prior to day  <dig>  indicating transit of the protein through the secretory pathway. to exclude the possibility that ntmmp1-gfp is secreted to the apoplast and not associated with the plasma membrane, cells were rinsed with  <dig>  m kno <dig> to induce plasmolysis. under these conditions gfp staining was clearly associated with the protoplasts, whereas no gfp was detected in the surrounding cell walls, confirming membrane integration .

transient expression of recombinant ntmmp <dig> and analysis of proteolytic activity
to facilitate analysis of ntmmp <dig> enzymatic activity, two recombinant ntmmp <dig> versions designated ntmmp1-apo and ntmmp1-kdel were produced. in both variants the c-terminal hydrophobic domain was omitted to facilitate protein extraction. ntmmp1-apo contained a c-terminal his <dig> tag for purification, ntmmp1-kdel contained the his <dig> tag followed by the er retention sequence. the corresponding ntmmp1-apo and ntmmp1-kdel cdnas were inserted into the plant expression vector ptrakt and the proteins transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. total soluble proteins were extracted from tobacco leaves using mild detergents and recombinant ntmmp <dig> was purified via the c-terminal histidine tag.

immunoblot analysis revealed that the purified recombinant ntmmp1-apo exists in two forms with apparent molecular masses of ~ <dig> and  <dig> kda . the theoretical mass calculated from the amino acid sequence lacking the signal peptide is  <dig>  kda. the difference between the predicted and apparent values probably reflects glycosylation at one or more of the seven potential n-glycosylation sites. the microheterogeneity of the upper band likely reflects differences in the glycosylation pattern and represents the full-length ntmmp <dig> protein including the propeptide. the lower molecular weight form of ntmmp <dig> that appears as a double band likely represents differentially processed forms without the propeptide. data for smep <dig> suggest that the protein could be processed in the region of amino acid residue  <dig>  <cit> , which is consistent with the observed molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda for the low molecular weight forms of recombinant ntmmp <dig> 

the zymography assay demonstrated that all forms of ntmmp1-apo are enzymatically active and degrade co-polymerized casein in a polyacrylamide gel, the same being true for the kdel-tagged version of the protein . preincubation of all recombinant forms with apma, a metallo-organic activator of metalloproteases  <cit> , did not enhance casein degradation, indicating that recombinant ntmmp <dig> is already present in an active form. in contrast, enzymatic activity was efficiently blocked by the inclusion of  <dig> mm edta in the protease buffer, showing that divalent cations are required as cofactors for ntmmp <dig> activity .

analysis of endogenous ntmmp <dig> expression in by- <dig> cells
the expression of ntmmp <dig> mrna and ntmmp <dig> protein was monitored in wild type by- <dig> cells between days  <dig> and  <dig> of a typical fermentation cycle. the mrna could be detected by northern blot at all time points although a slight increase was observed at day  <dig> . however, the overall expression levels were quite low, perhaps providing an explanation for the absence of ntmmp <dig> sequences in the by- <dig> est database  <cit> . in agreement with the transient expression data, the ntmmp <dig> protein was represented by two forms with molecular masses of >  <dig> kda and >  <dig> kda . in contrast to the mrna data, the abundance of both proteins declined towards the end of the cultivation. the mobility of the larger band was slightly retarded compared to the recombinant form of ntmmp <dig> reflecting the presence of the hydrophobic c-terminus, which was removed from the recombinant protein.

induction of ntmmp <dig> by pseudomonas syringae
to determine whether ntmmp <dig> can be induced by pathogens like other plant mmps, by- <dig> cells were incubated with either agrobacterium tumefaciens, pseudomonas syringae pv tomato or xylanase from trichoderma viridae  <cit> . total rna was isolated after  <dig> min and  <dig> h and northern blots were carried out using ntmmp <dig> as the probe . while ntmmp <dig> mrna levels are induced after treatment with p. syringae and a. tumefaciens, the xylanase treatment had no effect on ntmmp <dig> mrna levels indicating a lack of responsiveness toward fungal elicitors.

the induction level of ntmmp <dig> mrna after one hour of incubation with either p. syringae or a. tumefaciens were calculated from three independent biological replicates using the aida software. for the agrobacterium treatment the calculated induction factor is  <dig>   and for the pseudomonas treatment  <dig>  .

discussion
we have cloned a cdna encoding the matrix metalloproteinase ntmmp <dig> from tobacco by- <dig> cells, which possess all the expected features of a mmp including the cysteine switch, and the zinc-binding region and methionine turn motif in the catalytic domain. although the overall structure is very similar to other mmps, ntmmp <dig> also has some novel features, including the substitution of alanine for the second proline residue normally found within the cysteine switch consensus sequence prcxxpd  <cit> . since proline residues have a profound impact on protein structure, substitution with the non-polar amino acid alanine may lead to the inactivation of the cysteine switch by preventing the free cysteine residue coordinating the zinc ion within the catalytic domain and maintaining the latency of the proenzyme. the sensitivity of this motif towards amino acid replacements has been shown for the human mmp- <dig> where an arginine to histidine exchange within this domain inactivates the cysteine switch  <cit> . this amino acid substitution leads to structural changes within the prodomain and hence to an alternative activation mechanism that is independent of the cysteine switch motif.

another key feature is that ntmmp <dig> contains a second cysteine residue  in the n-terminal portion of the protein. according to the scratch protein predictor server  <cit>  this residue is predicted to form a disulfide bridge with cys  <dig> in the cysteine switch motif. therefore, it is unlikely that ntmmp <dig> is regulated by the cysteine switch mechanism that has been proposed for human mmp molecules  <cit> . the closest homologs to ntmmp <dig> are at2-mmp, at3-mmp, and at5-mmp from a. thaliana which also contain one  or two additional cysteine residues . the additional cysteine residues in these mmps are also predicted to form disulfide bridges with the cysteine residue from the switch motif, possibly representing constitutively active forms of the enzyme. like ntmmp <dig>  they have a c-terminal hydrophobic domain and are believed to reside in the plasma membrane  <cit> .

the above data suggest that ntmmp <dig> does not require proteolytic cleavage for activation, a hypothesis supported by the finding that apma treatment has no effect on ntmmp <dig> activity. although it is well established that zymogens are activated stepwise during zymography  <cit> , apma treatment is accompanied by a decrease in molecular mass due to autoproteolytic processing  <cit> . however, we observed no shift to a lower molecular mass in the ntmmp <dig> zymogram assay . furthermore both recombinant forms ntmmp1-apo and ntmmp1-kdel show the same activity although they are expected to have different subcellular localizations. while ntmmp1-kdel is expected to reside exclusively in the er due to the c-terminal kdel sequence, ntmmp1apo can follow the entire secretory pathway until it is finally secreted to the apoplast. therefore ntmmp <dig> seems to gain enzymatic activity immediately after synthesis in the er. since no endogenous mmp inhibitor proteins like the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases  in animals have been identified thus far in plants, it is likely that ntmmp <dig> is constitutively active.

ntmmp <dig> is expressed constitutively but at a low level during by- <dig> cell cultivation . the low expression level is reflected by the absence of ntmmp1-related sequences in an est library of by- <dig> cells containing more than  <dig> sequences  <cit> . ntmmp <dig> mrna is induced within  <dig> min after the treatment of by- <dig> cells with p. syringae and to a lesser extent by a. tumefaciens . other mmp genes induced by pathogenic bacteria include soybean gmmmp <dig>  which is induced after treatment with compatible and incompatible p. syringae pathovars  <cit> , and arabidopsis at3-mmp, which is rapidly induced after treatment of arabidopsis seedlings with a 22-amino-acid peptide  derived from p. syringae flagellin  <cit> . the normal substrates for ntmmp <dig> are unknown, so it may act directly against invading bacteria or may help to generate signaling molecules that trigger further defense responses of the plant cell. given the constitutive expression and activity of ntmmp <dig>  it might be an integral part of the plant's surveillance system for pathogens or other stress signals.

the n-terminal portion of ntmmp <dig>  is predicted to form a peptidoglycan-binding motif comprising three alpha helices, a structure initially described for the streptomyces albus zn2+ g peptidase  <cit> . according to the pfam protein families database  <cit>  many matrixins contain an n-terminal peptidoglycan-binding like motif . whether this domain binds to bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns  such as peptidoglycan  <cit>  and flagellin  <cit>  remains to be determined. the plant cell usually recognizes specific peptide fragments from pamps rather than the full length proteins  <cit> . in the case of flagellin, a peptide fragment from the do domain is recognized by the corresponding plant surface receptor  <cit> . yet this domain, and hence the flg <dig> peptide that binds to the plant fls <dig> receptor, is hidden inside the intact bacterial flagellum  <cit> . it is therefore tempting to speculate that plasma membrane-bound proteases such as ntmmp <dig> recognize pamps and process them to generate specific peptides that subsequently bind to their corresponding transmembrane receptors of the nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat , receptor-like kinase  or receptor-like protein  classes  <cit> . although ntmmp <dig> did not respond to the fungal elicitor xylanase  mmp induction has been shown in soybean for gmmmp <dig> treated with the oomycete p. sojae and in tomato for lemmp <dig> treated with the fungal elicitor fusicoccin  <cit> . therefore also certain pamps from fungal origin are able to induce mmp expression. in future work we will aim to determine the natural substrate of ntmmp <dig> and its potential role in pamp recognition and processing. however, the induction of ntmmp <dig> by bacterial pathogens indicates its involvement in pathogen recognition and defense responses and therefore contributes to our understanding of pathogen-host interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
the matrix metalloproteinase ntmmp <dig> is localized in the plasma membrane of tobacco by- <dig> cells. our biochemical data indicate that the enzyme is constitutively active, and this is supported by bioinformatic analysis of the primary sequence. the low basal level of ntmmp <dig> expression increases immediately after the exposure of tobacco by- <dig> cells to bacterial pathogens. given the low-level constitutive activity of the protein, its induction in response to bacterial pathogens and its localization at the cell surface, we propose that ntmmp <dig> plays a role in pathogen recognition and defense at the cell periphery.
