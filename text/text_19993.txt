BACKGROUND
the evolutionary history of the scorpions begun around 425– <dig> million years ago, in the middle silurian  <cit>  and these animals are therefore often considered “living fossils”. scorpions are morphologically conservative organisms  <cit>  and approximately  <dig> species are recognized and classified in different families  <cit> . the family buthidae is geographically distributed worldwide and is the largest of the scorpion families, comprising  <dig> genera and  <dig> species  <cit> . moreover, from a clinical perspective, buthidae is the most important scorpion family  <cit> . several members of this family are toxic to mammals and can be dangerous to humans  <cit> . stings by scorpion species dangerous to humans can induce different levels of toxicity and sometimes have lethal consequences. scorpion venom consists of a mixture of biologically active compounds:  peptide toxins that specifically target ion channels  and other cellular receptors  <cit> . in terms of venom, scorpion biodiversity is reflected in more than  <dig>  –  <dig>  distinct natural ligands. this value considers the number of described species and the data of the different venom analyses yielding the characterization of approx. 100– <dig> different venom components . advanced methods of venom fractionation, chromatography, mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing allow the characterization of the components in scorpion venom. however, the identification of a large number of animal toxins is often also based on information obtained via transcriptome analyses. expressed sequence tags  from venom glands provide complementary information and often reveal not yet described components related to the biological activity of the venoms. until now ,  <dig> scorpion nucleotide sequences were described  and only  <dig> were identified as scorpion toxin or toxin-like . as yet, we have discovered less than 1% of all venom components, despite the strong efforts made in this vast field to get knowledge about its considerable diversity.

mesobuthus gibbosus  is one of the most important health-threatening scorpions in turkey. this species is considered an old species living in the mediterranean shore of the aegean region, including anatolia, greece and aegean islands  <cit> . information related to the toxin and venom compounds from m. gibbosus is restricted to one report  <cit> , which describes the mrna precursors and peptides of three alpha-potassium channel toxins   <cit> . no data has been reported regarding the toxin genes or genomic organization in this species.

in the present work, we described 1) the first catalogue of gene expression by transcriptome analysis of venom gland  and 2) the genomic organization of the chlorotoxin genes. in order to generate the transcriptome data a cdna library from m. gibbosus scorpion was constructed. the non-amplified cdna library was randomly screened and the positive colonies carrying a dna insert corresponding to ≥500 bp of the putative toxin transcripts were subsequently dna sequenced and analyzed by bioinformatics tools. our results reveal information of genes related to some cellular processes  and genes involved in venom gland functions . we performed a comparative sequence analysis of the obtained toxin-like transcripts and the related toxin families. three chlorotoxin-like genes from m. gibbosus  were detected and the genomic organization of megcltxs genes allowed us to describe a new group of the chlorotoxin family. comparative sequence analysis with the genome of m. martensii and megcltxs genes provide evidence of two cltxs groups.

RESULTS
analysis of cdna sequences and identification of new genes
a cdna library from m. gibbosus scorpion was constructed with mrna extracted from a telson with a pair of venom glands from one specimen as previously described  <cit> . a random screening of  <dig> colonies using the non-amplified cdna library from a pair of venom glands  was performed. the cdna library clones were selected by pcr fragments, sequenced and analyzed via phred, cap <dig> and algorithms described in methods. quality values of the dna sequencer trace data produced by phred are used in the cap sequence assembly program for overlaps between reads, removal of false overlaps and construction of contigs, generating multiple sequence alignments and consensus sequences. results of cap <dig> allow the generated contigs, singlets and quality files. a total of  <dig> colonies  resulted in a sequence length corresponding to the expected size of a putative toxin or venom component transcripts . the  <dig> sanger sequences were analyzed and only  <dig> sequences high-quality ests were identified as  <dig> mgib sequences. of those  <dig> sequences,  <dig> mgib sequences  correspond one or more ests. we identified  <dig> of these  <dig> mgib sequences as putative precursor based on the corresponding orf . to attempt the functional classification of these sequences, we compared the consensus sequences against genbank and uniprotkb databases and we grouped the  <dig> mgib sequences in different transcript categories . figure  <dig> shows the relative proportion of categories . we found “toxin-like peptides” including sequences with high identity to scorpion toxin family genes . “antimicrobial and cytolytic peptides”  genes  and "other venom components" , described scorpion venom or secreted protein . the category “cellpro” includes transcripts encoding for proteins involved in cellular processes  such as enzymes, cell structure, ribosomal and other metabolism proteins. the "unknown function" category includes ests with an identity of already described sequences with no functional assessment and hypothetical scorpion peptides . the “no match” category includes ests that did not match with currently known sequences  while “noorf” describes sequence with non-identified open reading frame . mgib deduced amino acid sequences show a high similarity with some toxin genes from other mesobuthus species and other scorpion genes . additional file 1: table s <dig> shows the amino acid sequence deduced from the precursors of the different gene categories from m. gibbosus. amino acid sequences deduced of the mgib cdna sequences correspond to  <dig> new precursor sequences that encoded to toxins-like, venom components and antimicrobial or cytolytic peptides transcripts.

e-value
match and identity of the transcripts of different gene categories are shown. e-value is included in the right columns.

normally, a single-pass read of mgib cdna sequences includes the complete coding sequence  that corresponds with the sequence of amino acids in a peptide or protein. mgib ests contain single-pass reads of the cdna  sequence, encoding a complete precursor sequence which includes a signal peptide, mature sequence and depending of the transcript, an additional pro-peptide region. cap <dig> may yield conflicting bases in the sequence generated for the contig. in order to confirm the precursors deduced from our mgib singleton and contigs sequences and to be deposited in the genbank database, we performed additional dna sequencing of all obtained plasmids. confirmed sequences, which were constructed by alignment of the group of one or more dna sequences, was called “singleton”  and “contig” or clusters  to follow the sequence analysis previously described in the transcript categories. the obtained nucleotide sequences were deposited in the genbank database . the annotation was based on the best match in the consulted databases . however, some of the mgib plasmids could not provide additional dna sequence of high quality to complete the information of the corresponding single-pass read of cdna sequence . these sequences were deposited in a division of the genbank database to the expressed sequence tags .

toxins-like transcripts
scorpion venoms contain several structurally distinct families of peptidyl modulators of ion channels  <cit> . in accordance with the ion channel specificity, these peptides can be divided into four categories: 1) peptides of 60– <dig> amino acids linked by  <dig> disulfide bridges that modulate sodium channel activity; 2) short and long peptides of 30– <dig> residues with  <dig> or  <dig> disulfide bridges that block potassium channels; 3) short-chain peptides of 34– <dig> amino acids with four disulfide bridges and putative venom chloride channel toxin that blocks small-conductance chloride channels  and 4) short peptides with  <dig> disulfide bridges that modulate ryanodine receptors . the transcriptome analysis of m. gibbosus reveals a total of  <dig> new toxin transcripts included in the four categories of peptidyl modulators. we identified six transcripts that encode new members of the scorpion toxins specific to potassium channels belonging to the α-ktx and β-ktx families. the α-ktxs transcripts encode new toxin-like sequences of different subfamilies . mgib <dig> corresponds to a new β-ktx transcript. four different sequences encoding sodium channel toxins  were identified and its sequence analysis showed a match with α and β-natx classes. in addition, we identified a putative calcium channel toxin  similar to bmca <dig> toxin  and a putative chloride channel toxin or chlorotoxin-like transcript . our results indicate that the transcripts bear a relation to toxins from diverse scorpion genera targeting different ion channels.

potassium channel toxins
scorpion toxins specific to potassium channels have been classified into families as alpha, beta, gamma   <cit>  and kappa  on the basis of the alignment of cysteines and conserved residues  <cit> . the α-ktx family is considered as the largest potassium channel toxin family  <cit> . until now, the α-family included short-chain toxins  with a total of around  <dig> different peptides, comprising  <dig> subfamilies and new peptides and precursors being continuously described . the β-ktx family, also known as long-chain potassium channel toxins , has been organized into  <dig> groups  <cit> , later denominated class i, ii and iii  <cit> . peptide scorpion toxins that block the voltage-gated shakers  channels typically consist of 30– <dig> residues and have a molecular weight of about 4 kda  <cit> . however, β-ktxs have shown effects on some kv <dig> x channels and some members show a relation to scorpion defensins with antimicrobial activity.

α-ktx
five transcripts were identified that encode α-ktxs. figure  <dig> shows the alignment of megktx and related toxins. mgib <dig> encodes a toxin-like peptide precursor similar to some putative potassium channels not included in any α-ktx subfamily  and less similar to members of α-ktx <dig> x and α-ktx <dig> x families  . we believe mgib <dig> is a member of the new α-ktx subfamily . mgib <dig> belongs to the subfamily α-ktx <dig> x, which includes four members described from m. martensii <cit> . α-ktx <dig>  is a characterized toxin that selectively and reversibly inhibits small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. figure 2b shows the alignment of all precursors of the α-ktx <dig> x subfamily and mgib <dig>  with the signal peptide regions being highly conserved . following the nomenclature of ktxs  <cit> , mgib <dig> transcript corresponds to α-ktx <dig> . mgib <dig> encodes a precursor related with the α-ktx <dig> x. there are two members reported in this family and only α-ktx <dig>  has been described . the recombinant toxin α-ktx <dig>  was characterized, showing an effect on kv <dig>  channels expressed in cos <dig> cells  <cit> . according to the nomenclature, we consider that the mgib <dig> transcript corresponds to the α-ktx <dig> x subfamily . mgibc <dig> shows match and low identity with members of the α-ktx <dig> x subfamily. cobatoxin-  <dig> and  <dig> are all the members of the subfamily α-ktx <dig> x and correspond to α-ktx <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . these toxins block kv <dig> x channels  <cit>  . the mgibc <dig> mature sequence showed similarity with the invertebrate defensin galiomicin . figure 2d shown the alignment of mgibc <dig>  α-ktx <dig>  and galiomicin. the identity values  are too low to be considerate as a member of the same α-ktx <dig> x subfamily  <cit> .

new subfamily α-ktx  <dig> x
mgib <dig> encodes a precursor of a toxin-like peptide similar to the putative potassium channel toxin tx <dig> from buthus occitanus israelis , to the putative neurotoxin b and c precursors from lychas mucronatus  and lower identity with members of α-ktx <dig> x and α-ktx <dig> x families . meg <dig> is a partial gene that probably corresponds to the same complete amino acid sequence from mgib <dig>  however, the differences in the nucleotide sequence can be taken as evidence to consider it a different transcript. the presence of  <dig> cysteines in the predicted mature sequence from mgib <dig> and mgib <dig>  does not show a close relationship with subfamily α-ktx <dig> x members, that also possess  <dig> cysteines . members of the α-ktx <dig> x subfamily possess  <dig> cysteines and differ from the α-ktx <dig> x in the cysteines organization. precursors of mgib <dig>  tx <dig> and the putative neurotoxins b and c can be considered as members of the same ktx group . despite the lack of information related to the biological activity of members of this group, we believe that this group can be considered as a new α-ktx subfamily. according to the nomenclature for short-chain peptides, the percent of identity between α-ktxs subfamilies and database information  they correspond to α-ktx <dig> x  <cit> . the geographic distribution of scorpions is traditionally organized into two groups, namely the old and the new world scorpions. α-ktx <dig> , α-ktx <dig>  and α-ktx <dig>  precursors from the “old world”  show also differences between the “new world” α-ktx <dig> x members  . all “new world” α-ktx <dig> x members show a consensus sequence: wc2stc4xc10xc16xc20xc31xc36xc38yt  while “old world” members show a predicted mature sequence: qkxc8xc14xc18xc29xc34tc36yy. perhaps, some of the “old world” α-ktx <dig> x members can be reclassified since the cystine arrangement is different in the first two members of this subfamily . α-ktx <dig>  precursor shows similar cystine arrangement to the new α-ktx <dig> x family members . mgib <dig>  displays a match with α-ktx <dig>  and α-ktx <dig>  toxins . all described α-ktx <dig> x toxins correspond only to toxins belonging to scorpion species of the buthidae family and show an effect on potassium current and specific channels  <cit> . however, the low identity of the mgib <dig> and α-ktx <dig> x toxins precursors  and the discrepancy of the number of cysteines  support the idea of a new ktx subfamily.

β-ktxs
β-ktxs include “chimeric” peptides with a cysteine-free n-terminal sequence and a c-terminal with a recognizable cs-αβ motif that includes  <dig> cysteine residues  <cit> . mgib <dig> sequence, named megβ-ktx <dig>  is related to the group of the long-chain potassium ion channel blocker txkbeta <dig>  <cit>  and belongs to the β-ktx class  <dig>  <cit> . all precursors of the β-ktx class  <dig> reported so far belong to species of the buthidae family . while the precursor of the megβ-ktx <dig> shows more than 88% similarity with precursors from species belonging to “old world” genera, there was less correspondence with species from the genus tityus, which is classified among the “new world” genera. the signal peptide region has marked differences between old world, new world, and precursors of the chinese species lychas mucronatus . a further distinctive and interesting feature is the conservation of consensus residues ser-ser-cys, located before the pro-peptide region , which suggests that it might be a conserved region involved in the post-translational processing of the precursor. the mature peptides are conserved in the putative pro-peptide regions although they are better conserved in the c-terminal. the residues h <dig> and g <dig> exhibit a high degree of conservation in all β-ktx members  and additionally, residue p <dig> was preserved in β-ktx class i and ii . the latter class also includes peptides poorly characterized called “orphan” peptides. some members of the β-ktx class i have been biochemically characterized and it was discovered that they exhibit biological activity on potassium ion channels  or potassium channels in synaptosomes . nevertheless, the post-translational processing and biological activity of the pro-peptides  remain to be elucidated. on the other hand, genomic information of the β-ktx class i is limited to a single report concerning the genomic organization of ttrbetaktx  from tityus trivitatus  which contains an intron that interrupts the pro-peptide region  <cit> . notwithstanding the fact that currently several research groups continue to contribute valuable data related to new β-ktx members , genetic information  and our actual knowledge regarding the biological characterization is not sufficient to allow us to clearly understand β-ktx toxins role.

sodium channel toxins
scorpion na+ channel toxins  modify the activity of voltage-gated sodium  channels. natxs are peptides that contain 58– <dig> amino acid residues in length, linked by  <dig> disulfide bridges   <cit> . physiological experiments have shown that these peptides modify the gating mechanisms of the sodium channels function, affecting the inactivation  or the activation  of the channel kinetics  <cit> . according to their effects and the binding sites on nav channels: i) α-class scorpion toxins for nav bind to channel receptor site  <dig> and show an effect in the inactivation mechanism of the channels  <cit> ; ii) scorpion β-class toxins modify the nav activation process by shifting activation to more negative membrane potentials after binding to site  <dig>  <cit> . several natxs show differential effects on mammals and insects. depending on their in vivo effect, the insect-specific toxins are usually classified as “excitatory” or “depressant”  <cit> . here, four different mgib sequences encode new natx’s-like peptides . mgib natx’s precursor sequences show a match to α- and β-natx: two putative depressant insect β-toxins transcripts were obtained. mgibcluster <dig>  and mgib <dig> are putative depressant insect β-toxins that show 84% identity with bmkita <dig> precursor . the mature sequence of mgibc <dig> and mgib <dig> show more than 79% identity with other putative depressant insect toxins . mgib <dig> and mgib <dig> belong to the α-natx class with mgib <dig> being a partial clone encoding a gene very similar to precursors described from m. eupeus . figure 4b shows precursors related to mgib <dig>  all putative toxins are reported as unknown activity. the signal peptide sequences display a strong conservation in the amino acid sequence. this phenomenon was observed within the depressant toxins family from b. occitanus israelis <cit> . mgib <dig> shows a match to the precursor sequence of a sodium toxin peptide from m. martensii  . however, this precursor shows low identity and differences in the putative mature sequence with the related toxins . the predicted signal peptide shows a cleavage site between position  <dig> and  <dig> , the mature sequence will include residues  <dig> to  <dig>  and an odd number of cysteines. mgib <dig> plasmid was fully sequenced by both strands  thus excluding the possibility of an error of the number of cysteines. previously, the odd number of cysteines has been observed in amino acid sequences deduced from scorpion cdna .

antimicrobial precursor and other venom components
besides precursor of neurotoxins-like peptides, three mgib transcripts correspond to venom components with other biological activities: a partial clone similar to phospholipase precursor  and two transcripts with high identity to scorpion cytotoxic/antimicrobial peptides . antimicrobial peptides can be divided into different groups according to their primary and secondary structure. one of these groups is related with the defensins widespread in different phyla and other group is called ‘cytotoxin linear peptides’. the linear peptides are mostly α-helical peptides with no cysteines called non-disulfide-bridge peptides   <cit> . five putative transcripts were predicted to belong to the antimicrobial peptide transcripts. they correspond to the mgibc <dig>  mgibc <dig> , mgibc <dig>  mgibc <dig> and mgib <dig> . these putative antimicrobial peptides display similarity to venom components of other species . we have identified one partial gene of a putative defensin . this sequence shows low identity  with the plant defensin from the barrel medic medicago trunculata  and the mollusk hyriopsis cumingii . defensins conserve a cysteine-stabilized α-helix and β–sheet  structural motif widely distributed in plants and the animal kingdom . figure  <dig> shows the alignments of meg-ndbps and related precursor of ndbp families. the predicted mature sequence of cluster <dig> or megc <dig>  shows similarity to precursors of the cytotoxic peptides and antimicrobial peptide members: marcin- <dig> and meucin- <dig> from m. martensii and m. eupeus respectively . according to the name of homologous genes, megc <dig> precursor was named megicin- <dig> . cluster mgibc <dig> and mgib <dig> encode two very similar precursors related to the antimicrobial peptide from mesobuthus species  and from l. mucronatus  of the ndbp  <dig> subfamily. cluster mgibc <dig> is related to the bradykinin-potentiating peptides ndbp  <dig> subfamily. this family includes the longest peptides  of the ndbp families  <cit> . mgibc <dig> precursor shows 76–89% identity  with related precursors . antimicrobial peptides can be viewed as an emerging class of agents because the spectra include bacteria and fungi  <cit> . in this respect, antimicrobial peptides are a fantastic unexplored resource for use in drug design.

transcripts related to cellular functions and unknown genes
we will only mention the number of transcripts obtained in the “cellpro” and “unknown” transcript categories. nine transcripts encoding common cellular proteins match proteins involved in diverse cell functions such as ribonuclease, nadh dehydrogenase or cytochrome b. additional file 1: table s <dig> shows the deduced amino acid sequence of cellpro and unknown transcripts. in addition, clusters mgibc <dig>  mgibc <dig> and clones mgib <dig>  mgib <dig>  mgib <dig>  mgib <dig>  mgib <dig>  mgib <dig> and mgib <dig> are similar to other scorpion hypothetical proteins with a function that remains unknown. lastly, two “no match” orfs were found .

the profile of gene expression in the venom glands from buthidae family
in general, transcript sequences from venom glands have been used in various types of analysis: expression of different transcript categories, conservation of mature sequences, genomic organization and approaching the diversification of toxin families by gene codon usage. to the best of our knowledge, only ten reports are available describing transcriptome analyses in buthidae family: tityus discrepans <cit> , lychas mucronatus <cit> , hottentotta judaicus <cit> , t. stigmurus <cit> , t. serrulatus <cit> , isometrus maculatus  <cit> centruroides tecomanus <cit>  and b. occitanus israelis <cit>  by sanger sequencing; the transcriptome analysis from c. noxius performed with a pyrosequencing platform  <cit>  and m. martensii sequencing by ilumina  <cit> . kozminsky-atias et al. <cit> , used cdna library information of the venom glands from b. occitanus israelis to show that the codon usage depends on the translational regulatory mechanisms, and to study the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the diversity of scorpion toxins. the genus mesobuthus  has been studied in diverse aspects related to its venom components. however, information regarding the general transcriptome analysis is still limited to b. occitanus israelis and m. martensii. figure  <dig> compares the percentage of all gene categories reported of transcriptome analyses in the buthidae scorpions by sanger sequencing, integrating the sum of categories into  <dig> groups: i) transcripts of venom functions, which include toxins, antimicrobial, cytolytic peptides and venom component transcripts ii) cellular processes transcripts and iii) other transcripts including no match, no orf and unknown functions transcripts. comparative transcriptome analyses for the venom glands from m. gibbosus indicate that the abundance of toxin transcripts is high compared to the other transcriptome categories and congruent with the other buthidae transcriptomes in similar conditions . in contrast, a smaller percent of toxin transcripts was observed in the transcriptome analysis of the “resting” venom glands cdna library from h. judaicus  and t. serrulatus . in these cases the percentage of “cellpro” transcripts was the highest compared to other transcriptomes . despite the fact that we used similar conditions for the library construction, the transcriptome analyses in the buthidae family showed different venom compounds and differences in the percentage of gene categories. according to the original source of transcriptome information, the sum of the toxin transcript, antimicrobial, cytolytic peptide categories and other venom components corresponds to: 50% from  <dig> high quality ests in t. discrepans <cit> , to 75% from  <dig> high quality ests in t. stigmurus <cit> , 37% from  <dig> high quality ests in t. serrulatus, 55% and 57% from  <dig> readable sequences in l. mucronatus  and l. mucronatus   <cit> , 24% from  <dig> high-quality clones in h. judaicus <cit> , 78% from  <dig> clones in b. occitanus israelis <cit> ; 57% from  <dig> sequences in c. tecomanus <cit> , 53% from  <dig> readable sequences in i. maculatus  <cit>  and  <dig> % using  <dig> high-quality ests in m. gibbosus . comparative analysis of the transcriptome analyses reported for buthidae genus is an important tool to compare the expression of family genes in venom glands. in addition, transcriptome analyses can reveal an inter-species difference originating from different habitat, feeding behavior and other conditions . c. noxius transcriptome analysis was performed by a different sequencing method . however, the three conditions used in the library construction allowed comparing the abundance and transcript level differences in each condition and in the same species  <cit> . at this point, the conditions used for the cdna library construction are important elements having a repercussion on the ests analysis and the interpretation of the differential expression pattern. these conditions may also reveal intra-species  differences based on the physiological state of the specimen.

in recent times, the genome of m. martensii revealed  <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> . the authors described a total of  <dig> neurotoxin genes located in this genome , consisting of  <dig> natxs,  <dig> ktxs,  <dig> cltxs and  <dig> catx or toxins for ryanodine receptors. in addition, cao and colleagues  <cit>  confirmed  <dig> expressed neurotoxin genes in the transcriptome analysis by next generation sequencing . the advantage and the limitations of the sequencing technology depends on factors such as the sample  amount, focus of the study or the cost. but, all sequencing techniques allow to explore different transcriptomes from venomous species. high throughput sequencing or next generation sequencing platforms offer the possibility of generating thousands of sequences that contribute to the study of different conditions and provide a “complete” catalogue of the gene expression . in this sense, our low-throughput sequencing is far from a complete catalogue of the gene expression. however, sanger sequencing in transcriptome is the approach often used for the screening of the cdna libraries in the follow conditions: i) limiting sample amount  ii) transcripts sequencing for a future characterization  and iii) general catalogues with focus in toxin or venom component transcripts . our results by sanger sequencing provided a total of  <dig> “toxin transcripts”  corresponding to 10% of the neurotoxin genes located in the m. martensii genome . rendon-anaya et al. <cit> , identified  <dig> different toxin-like isogroups from c. noxius analysis by  <dig> sequencing  but only  <dig> toxin-like isogroups correspond to ion channel specific toxins. our results of toxin–like transcripts to specific ion channel correspond to 25% of toxin transcripts obtained by  <dig> sequencing platform. the number of transcripts and information provided by the transcriptomes by sanger sequencing is still important for the contribution to the scorpion transcripts.

chlorotoxin-like genes and the first scorpion genome genomic organization
in the second part of this work, we identified a transcript that encodes a new putative chlorotoxin . this sequence shows a full-length cdna of 254 bp including the 3’-utr . chlorotoxin is a putative venom chloride channel toxin from leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus that blocks small conductance-chloride channels and is able to bind glioma cells  <cit> . around  <dig> chlorotoxin-like precursors from scorpions have been described , however only a few of them have been biochemically characterized . prior to the characterization of chlorotoxin, the team of prof. grishin described several small insect toxins from m. eupeus . these peptides show activity on insects and show a primary structure related to the chlorotoxin precursor as homologous peptides. in addition, a partial n-terminal sequence and the deduced amino acid sequences of i <dig> and i <dig> insectotoxin-like peptides were reported  <cit> . the insect toxin intoxi <dig>  is more the 90% identical to the mgib <dig> deduced amino acid sequence. furthermore, similarities between chlorotoxin and members of the α-ktxs family increased the interest in characterizing chlorotoxin-like peptides and synthetic peptides with the catalytic dyad essential to the activity on kv <dig> x channels  <cit> , even though no effect on kv <dig> x channels was reported. according to the information from the genbank/uniprotkb, the chlorotoxins meuctx- <dig> and meucltx  from m. eupeus show an effect on kv <dig> /kcna <dig> channels. unfortunately, the data to support this has not been published by the authors yet.

mgib <dig> mature sequence shows a methionine as first residue similarly to other precursor sequences from m. eupeus and a. autralis . recently, the genome of m. martensii reveled the genomic organization of five chlorotoxin genes   <cit> , one of which  has been previously described and named bm12-chlorotoxin gene while bmkcltx <dig> shared its deduced amino acid sequence. former to the report of the m. martensii genome, we attempted to elucidate the genomic organization of the chlorotoxin genes from m. gibbosus to provide evidence of the different classes of cltxs genes by precursor and genomic organization. signal peptide conservation of cltxs precursors and mgib <dig> were used to the design of specific screening from genomic dna. three cltx genes from m. gibbosus were obtained from a pcr reactions, using specific primers that correspond to the precursor sequence of 183 bp . figure  <dig> shows the megcltxs precursor sequences deduced from the cdna and gdna. these genes were named megcltx <dig>  megcltx <dig> and megcltx <dig> . megcltxs gene sequences were deposited in the genbank database . we performed additional experiments with cdna to confirm the expression of megcltxs genes. megcltx <dig> and megcltx <dig> are expressed in the venom glands  and its deduced amino acid sequence showed an identity between the three sequences corresponding to 85% and between 63-66% with the other cltxs . all the sequences showed a small intron inserted in the signal peptide sequence . the genomic organization of megcltxs genes showed similarities with the genomic organization of chlorotoxin-like bm <dig> or bmkcltx <dig> . chlorotoxin-bm- <dig> gene has an intron of 93 bp  <cit>  while the size of megcltxs introns was in the range of 88–90 bp . we compared the nucleotide sequences obtained from m. gibbosus and m. martensii genome. despite that the genome sequences for bmkcltx <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were reported as partial amino acid sequences  <cit> , we compared sequences that correspond to the bm <dig> gene, megcltxs, the genomic sequence of the bmkcltx <dig> contig <dig>  and bmkcltx <dig> contig <dig> . we observed a high identity between bmkcltx <dig>  bmkcltx <dig> sequences and the obtained sequence to megcltxs . we predicted one intron in all the sequences analyzed and a different start codon to the bmkcltx <dig>  according with our analysis, the signal peptide to bmkcltx <dig> reported by cao et al. <cit> , corresponds to the intron region predicted in bm <dig> and the three megcltxs genes . we could not predict a donor site to the bmkcltx <dig>  however, the acceptor splice site is present in the same region as the other cltxs genes in additional file 3: figure s <dig> . furthermore, the contig sequence for bmkcltx <dig> and bmkcltx <dig> include additional residues similar to megcltxs not included in the deduced amino acid sequence reported by cao et al. <cit>  . our results thus provide information to complete and generate a second group in the chlorotoxin family from genus mesobuthus.

CONCLUSIONS
this report revels part of the diversity of genes expressed in the venom glands from m. gibbosus. we identified several transcripts of toxic relevance as evidenced by orthologous genes. furthermore, ribosomal and housekeeping transcripts were obtained. the transcriptome analysis revealed new putative peptides and may help to identify putative post-translational modifications in the deduced amino acid precursor sequences of the transcripts. in addition, for the chlorotoxin family genes, we described the genomic organization of three new genes and confirmed the corresponding expressed sequences for two of them. this information may contribute to the classification of chlorotoxin genes into two groups for the genus mesobuthus. this transcriptome contribution can be useful for further studies and to help discovery new gene families, toxins and other venom components.
