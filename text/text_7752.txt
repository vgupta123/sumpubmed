BACKGROUND
fish diseases caused by viruses, bacteria and parasites are recognized as a significant constraint on aquaculture production and trade hence affecting the economy seriously  <cit> . a global estimate of disease losses in aquaculture surpassed us$  <dig> billion per year, which is about 15% of the value of world farmed fish and shellfish production  <cit> . successful defence against pathogenic infection is dependent on the ability to detect the presence of the invading pathogen  <cit> . teleost fish possess the elements of both the innate defence system and the acquired specific immune system  <cit> . however, the adaptive immune response in fish is less developed than that in higher vertebrates  <cit> . therefore, innate immune system is quite important in fish and believed to be the first line of host defence in opposing pathogenic organisms or any other foreign material  <cit> . in aquaculture, the basic data on fish-pathogen interactions have been effectively applied for large scale vaccination to aid in the generation of robust and long-lasting immune responses  <cit> . however, the development of an effective vaccine is a complex process. the prerequisites for developing vaccines are the understanding of the basic epidemiology of diseases and the immune system of the target species and identifying the genes and pathways involved in transcript response of a fish upon infection  <cit> .

expressed sequence tags  generated by cdna cloning have proven to be a powerful and rapid tool for identifying genes  <cit> . ests also form the basis for subsequent microarray design, snp detection and the placement of novel markers on genetic linkage maps  <cit> . currently ests are available from a large number of fish species, such as european seabass  <cit> , halibut  <cit> , cod  <cit> , trout  <cit> , salmon  <cit> , european and japanese flounders  <cit>  and catfish  <cit>  which enabled the identification of immune-related genes in these species. however, screening for immune-related genes in est databases using bioinformatic tools allows identification of only those genes that share sequence similarities with known immune-related proteins from other organisms  <cit> , but misses novel genes related to immune responses. suppression subtractive hybridization   <cit>  can be applied to identify differentially expressed genes in different tissues or conditions and thus is also a highly effective method for identifying novel genes related to important biological processes. this technique has been proven to be a suitable tool for identification of novel immune-related genes in a variety of teleost fish species, including flounder  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , salmon  <cit> , grouper  <cit> , croaker  <cit> , cod  <cit> , sea bream  <cit> , turbot  <cit> , dogfish  <cit>  and european seabass  <cit> .

the asian seabass lates calcarifer distributed in the tropical and sub-tropical areas of asia is an important marine foodfish species in southeast asia and australia. this species has been cultured for more than  <dig> years in brackish-water ponds and in recent years in floating cages. the global annual production of asian seabass was currently  <dig>  metric tons according to fao statistics  <cit> . in the past few years, we conducted a breeding program for asian seabass  <cit>  and developed a number of genomic tools such as microsatellites  <cit> , snps in genes  <cit> , linkage maps  <cit> , bac and cdna libraries  <cit>  to facilitate the selective breeding program. massive mortalities caused by bacterial or viral infections in intensive aquaculture production have caused serious economic losses in asian seabass aquaculture. some kinds of bacteria, such as cytophaga johnsoniae and streptococcus iniae have currently been isolated from sick seabass in singapore  <cit> , thailand  <cit>  and australia  <cit> . in order to shield the aquaculture loss by pathogenic diseases, asian seabass aquaculture urgently requires effective disease prevention strategies. although some studies had shown that asian seabass exhibited strong immune responses against bacteria based on the antibody activities in sera  <cit> , little information on host--pathogen interaction during infection with pathogenic microorganisms is available for this species.

immune response can be experimentally stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides   <cit> . cdna libraries of liver, kidney and spleen have been proven to be an excellent source of genetic information concerning immune function in fish  <cit> . the aim of this study was to identify and analyze immune-response genes in asian seabass by challenging individuals with lps, the ssh technology and bioinformatic tools.

RESULTS
ssh efficiency
the efficiency of subtraction can be estimated with pcr analysis by comparing the abundance of housekeeping genes and differentially expressed genes before and after subtraction . in this experiment, an immune-related gene  and a house-keeping gene  were used to examine the efficiency of subtraction. quantitative real-time pcr analysis of ighm and Î¯-actin revealed that ssh efficiency was  <dig>  fold for the forward subtractive library and  <dig>  fold for the reverse subtractive library.

generation of subtractive cdna libraries and assembly of ests
two subtractive cdna libraries, a forward subtractive library  and a reverse subtractive library  were constructed using subtractive cdna from spleen of asian seabass sampled at  <dig> hour post challenge with lps and control samples. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> randomly picked clones for the forward subtractive library and the reverse subtractive library, respectively, were sequenced. after trimming of end and vector sequences and eliminating sequences with low quality and/or shorter than  <dig> bases, a total of  <dig> high quality sequences were obtained. among the  <dig> high quality sequences  <dig> were derived from the forward subtractive library whereas  <dig> from the reverse subtractive library .

after assembly and clustering,  <dig> unique transcripts consisting of  <dig> singletons and  <dig> contigs  were obtained. among the  <dig> contigs,  <dig>  contained  <dig> ests,  <dig>  had 3- <dig> ests and  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> or more sequences. the largest contig was formed by  <dig> ests.

annotation of ests
blast searches against known sequences in public databases using the programs blastx and blastn revealed that  <dig> unique transcripts were similar to  <dig> known genes and  <dig> unannotated mrna sequences with high confidence  in the database. the remaining  <dig> unique transcripts were potentially novel sequences or utrs of known genes. three hundred and thirty-one of these known genes and unannotated mrna sequences were represented by multiple sequences . among the known genes and mrna sequences represented by est clones,  <dig> were found in the reverse subtractive library and  <dig> were found in the forward subtractive library, respectively. of which,  <dig> were present in both libraries. the percentage  of unique transcripts presented both in reverse and forward subtractive libraries was slightly higher than that in some previous studies , such as on grouper epinephelus coioides  <cit> . this might be related to the nature of ssh technique used in this study. although differentially expressed genes were enriched significantly with the approach, some of the unwanted genes might not have been eliminated completely in the libraries. when more clones of the ssh libraries were sequenced, as in our study, more rare transcripts would be found in both of the forward and reverse libraries. this should increase the percentage of unique transcripts that are present both in reverse and forward subtractive libraries.

the globin gene family was among the predominant est sequence clusters in both libraries. of the  <dig> est sequences,  <dig> %  matched the globin family ,  <dig> %  were ribosomal proteins ,  <dig> %  were initiation factors and  <dig> %  belonged to elongation factors . these results probably reflect that the fish were in an active growth stage. interestingly, the expression of the globin gene family  and elongation factors  were significantly differentiated between two libraries, indicating some globin proteins  and elongation factors  might play important roles in host defence.

the complete results of blast searches of the asian seabass ests from the forward subtractive and reverse subtractive libraries are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

functional classification
available bioinformatic tools, such as the gene ontology  go slimmer and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  provide useful information to analyze the functional profile of annotated genes  <cit> . a total of  <dig> annotated genes were used in functional classification . according to go slimmer results, genes encoding for proteins associated with cellular process, metabolic process and biology regulation in category of biological processes  were the three largest annotated subcategories. the second largest group was genes encoding products related to regulation of biological process, response to stimulus and developmental process in both of the forward subtractive library and the reverse subtractive library. the remaining genes encoded products were involved in many other diverse biological processes. with respect to cellular components , we observed that a large proportion of sequences were classified into cell, cell part and organelle followed by organelle part, macromolecular complex, extracellular region and membrane-enclosed lumen in the forward and the reverse subtractive libraries. as expected, a remarkably high proportion of annotated sequences were categorized as binding and catalytic activity followed by transcription regulator activity and transporter activity in both of the libraries . analysis of go categories showed that the functional distribution of the genes of the two libraries in the three categories was similar . the detailed information of functional classification is shown in additional file  <dig> and  <dig> 

ko  is a pathway-based classification of orthologous gene groups. four hundred and sixty seven of the  <dig> unique transcripts with ko assignments were composed of  <dig> unique genes. of which,  <dig> unique genes belonged to  <dig> kegg pathways. interestingly,  <dig> annotated genes were found in  <dig> immune-related pathways, including complement and coagulation cascades , chemokine signaling pathway , antigen processing and presentation , toll-like receptor signaling pathway , leukocyte transendothelial migration , t cell receptor signaling pathway , hematopoietic cell lineage , b cell receptor signaling pathway , natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity  and fc epsilon ri signaling pathway . most of the annotated genes were associated with cellular process  and diseases  and metabolism , followed by environmental  and genetic  information processing. our data suggest that several important immune processes were likely to be affected by the lps challenge.

immune-related genes and differentially expressed genes in subtractive libraries
genes in the go subcategories 'response to stimulus' and 'immune system process' are likely to be involved in the interaction of bacteria with its host. we identified a total of  <dig> genes  with response to the lps challenge, whereas only  <dig> genes were shared between two libraries. these genes were mainly associated with response to stress , response to chemical stimulus , response to external stimulus , cellular response to stimulus , regulation of response to stimulus  and immune response . most of the responsive genes were under represented in the library with only one copy in each library. although the percentage of unique genes responding to stimulus contained in both libraries was not significant, the actual number of the est clones representing these genes  was quite different between two libraries . in addition,  <dig> % of the est clones  matched the genes in immune system process  based on go term and kaas data. the est clones of immune genes were found statistically different between two libraries . majority of the immune and stress-related est sequences identified in this study  were reported for the first time in the asian seabass.

based on the number of homologous ests in the two libraries, fisher's exact test found a significant increase in abundance for a total of  <dig> genes  and a significant decrease in abundance for  <dig> genes upon challenge with lps, suggesting a strong transcriptional regulation upon lps challenge . homologues of some immune-related genes such as ly <dig> d and eef2l were found exclusively in one library, and some others such as c1ql4l and hmox <dig> were found highly expressed not only in one library but also in another library at a much lower frequency. only  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes that differentially expressed in spleen of the asian seabass upon challenge with lps were classified as immune response-related genes in the gene ontology database  <cit> . however,  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> differentially expressed genes could be identified as immune response-related genes in innatedb non-redundant list  <cit>  except ba <dig>  agc <dig>  hdr, hbaa <dig>  rps <dig>  eef and two unknown genes.

count-up, est count of a given gene in the forward subtractive library; est count in the reverse subtractive library. p <  <dig>  indicates statistically significant.

by the go classification scheme, the significantly differentially expressed genes were divided into subsets based on their functions. among the genes with increased abundance,  <dig> major groups can be identified, including binding , catalytic activity , transporter activity , enzyme regulator , antioxidant activity  and structural molecule activity  and with no hit for the remaining  <dig> genes . for the abundance-decreased genes, go annotation reveals their involvement in several subcategories of molecular function including binding , catalytic activity  and molecular transducer activity  and no assignment for two remaining genes .

ests containing microsatellites and snps
screening of all est sequences for microsatellites  identified  <dig> microsatellites with â¥ <dig> repeats . out of these  <dig> microsatellites,  <dig> had significant hits with known genes  by blast . twelve  of the microsatellites were dinucleotide and  <dig> were trinucleotide , while only  <dig> tetranucleotide  were found. because  <dig> individuals were used in library construction in this study and around  <dig> est sequences were available, it was possible to identify high quality snps. three hundred and three of the  <dig> contigs  contained snps, indicating that a very high polymorphism exists in genome of the asian seabass among individuals.

validation of subtractive library data by quantitative rt-pcr  and expression profiles of genes in response to lps challenges
to validate the subtractive library data, qrt-pcr was performed on  <dig> randomly selected annotated genes and  <dig> unknown gene sequences. of which,  <dig> genes were considered to be up-regulated and  <dig> genes were presumably down-regulated in spleen upon lps challenge, based on the differences of homologous est counts in both libraries . the expression levels for these genes were evaluated on the spleen rna samples at  <dig> h post challenge with lps and in the control group. the expression levels were normalized with a house-keeping gene, elongation factor 1-alpha  and are presented as in fig.  <dig>  in well agreement with the est data, all genes with higher counts in the forward subtractive library tested in the qrt-pcr assay showed clear induction in the spleen upon lps challenge and three  of the remaining genes with higher counts in the reverse subtractive library showed clear suppression after injection with lps. however, the expression levels for the remaining genes myd <dig> and cmklr <dig> in two groups were significantly different from the est counts in two libraries. this inconsistency might be caused by the random sampling errors in sequencing since their expressions were very low in spleen with only one copy in reverse subtractive library .

in addition to the quantitative analysis of the expressions of these genes in spleen by qrt-pcr, expressions of these genes in liver and kidney in experimental  and control groups were analyzed using qrt-pcr to add information about the spatial expression of these genes. as shown in fig.  <dig>  it was surprising that all of the  <dig> genes down-regulated in spleen were highly up-regulated in liver and  <dig> of which were significantly up-regulated in kidney, except gene krt <dig> and dbpht. but for the  <dig> genes up-regulated in spleen, only  <dig> were significantly up-regulated in liver and  <dig> were significantly up-regulated in kidney as detected by qrt-pcr assay.

discussion
discovery of novel ests from the subtractive cdna libraries of asian seabass spleen
ssh is an effective method to study functional expression levels of specific transcripts in various cells and tissues  <cit> . this study identified a total of  <dig> unique transcripts, of which  <dig> were similar to  <dig> known genes and  <dig> unannotated mrna available in public databases and the remaining  <dig> unique transcripts were potentially novel sequences or utrs of known genes. some of these genes might play important roles in host-pathogen interaction during infection. future functional studies of these genes could improve our understanding of innate defence system of fish against pathogenic infection.

currently, total est collection for the asian seabass in ncbi est database  <cit>  is approaching to  <dig>  and all of these data originated from a brain cdna library  <cit> . the addition of  <dig> unique transcripts from asian seabass to the existing database would not only make a contribution to functional genomic studies, but also help the annotation of genome and the comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in the near future.

genes involved in innate immune responses
fish represents the earliest class of vertebrates possessing the elements of both innate and acquired immunity  <cit> . the soluble mediators released by fish immune cells can regulate inflammatory responses and have a fully functional complement system and unique receptors that recognize pathogens  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig> annotated genes  in response to stimulus and  <dig> genes  matching genes in immune system process. it was much higher than those reported in european seabass  with only  <dig> genes  categorized to the go category "immune system process" after infected with v. anguillarum  <cit>  and with  <dig> % of the ests showing significant similarities with immune genes after nodavirus infection  <cit> . the majority of immune and stimulus-related est sequences detected in this study were reported for the first time in the asian seabass. of which, some homologous genes found in this study were previously reported to play an important role in the innate immune response of vertebrate animals upon bacterial infection, e.g., hepcidin  <cit> . based on our est data, we identified hepcidin- <dig>  gene in the asian seabass. the cdna sequence with a length of  <dig> bp consisted of the whole orf and partials of the utrs for hepcidin and encoded a peptide of  <dig> amino acids with a molecular weight of  <dig> daltons. this represents the first antimicrobial peptide gene discovered in the asian seabass.

many pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor -like, interleukin- <dig>  and il-1-like receptors have been identified in a number of fish species  <cit> . in our study some pro-inflammatory cytokines and related receptors have also been identified, such as tnf receptor super family member  <dig> , il- <dig> receptor a , chemokine receptor-like  <dig> , chemokine  receptor  <dig> , chemokine  receptor  <dig>  and chemokine  ligand  <dig> . complement components are also known to play a role in linking innate and adaptive immunity. a number of complement and complement receptor homologs such as c1r, c <dig> inhibitor, c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> have also been identified from a variety of fish species  <cit> . from our est data, we identified complement component c <dig> , c <dig> and cr <dig>  c <dig> and c3b and complement factor . to our knowledge, the complement receptor cr <dig>  has not been previously reported in fish.

lectins are also known to play an important role in the innate immunity of fish  <cit> . two c-type lectins  have been identified in rainbow trout  <cit>  and c-type lectin receptors have also been identified in two species of cichlid fish, paralabidochromis chilotes and oreochromis niloticus  <cit> . we identified c-type lectin domain family  <dig> member c , c-type lectin domain family  <dig> member e  and a kind of f-type lectins  in our libraries. in addition, the toll-like receptors  were reported to play a critical role in innate immunity against fungal and bacterial infections by initiating intracellular signal transduction that results in the expression of genes involved in inflammation, antiviral responses and maturation of dendritic cells  <cit> . we found at least  <dig> genes were involved in toll-like receptor signaling pathway such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit , tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member  <dig> , proto-oncogene protein c-fos  and ras-related c <dig> botulinum toxin substrate  <dig> .

differentially expressed genes associated with immune processes
a number of similarities in immune response exist between mammals and fish  <cit> . analysis of the immune system of the zebrafish revealed a fully developed adaptive and innate immune system showing notable similarities to the mammalian equivalent  <cit> . by comparative analysis of ests, many conserved genes responded upon the bacterial infection were revealed between asian seabass and mammals. for example, apolipoprotein e  was found to work as an immune modulator in humans  <cit> , european seabass, carp and medaka  <cit> . in this study we also detected a substantial increase in the expression of this gene upon lps challenge. based on the approximate expression patterns inferred from spleen est sources of mammals  <cit> , we concluded that more than half of the differentially expressed genes detected in this study were also found to be highly expressed in the spleen of mammals. some of the genes detected in this study have highly homologous counterparts of well-known mammalian spleen genes such as ba <dig>  eef2l and c1ql4l, being a homologue of hbb-b <dig>  eef <dig> and c1qa, respectively. all together, these data indicate that there are many conserved features in expression and function of genes in spleen between fish and mammals.

our data also suggest that  <dig>  out of the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed transcripts could not be identified as immune response-related genes in current public databases. the hematopoietic death receptor  and the ba <dig> globin gene were highly differentially expressed upon lps challenge. zh-dr was the first tnfr family member to be identified in zebrafish and specific to haematopoietic tissue  <cit> . however, little information of the function of this gene in innate immune response is available currently. it was reported that death receptors belong to the tnf /ngf  receptor superfamily and contribute to regulation of the adaptive immune response  <cit> . some reports also suggested that hemoglobin can be induced in macrophages stimulated with lps and interferon-Î³ that synergistically increases the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the innate immune system in response to lps  <cit> . our result suggested that similar to other dr and hemoglobin genes, zh-dr and ba <dig> globin gene might have potential immune regulatory functions in response to bacterial infection in fish. alternatively, mammalian heme oxygenase  <dig>  was up-regulated strongly during stress and following pathogen entry  <cit> . to our surprise, hmox <dig> was found to be significant down-regulated in spleen of seabass during the acute inflammatory response in this study. another study of atlantic salmon  also showed that hmox <dig> was down-regulated in spleen to infection with the salmon louse  at  <dig> day post infection  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that some differences might exist in immune-mediated inflammatory responses during host--pathogen interaction between fish and mammal.

putative markers in innate immunity
the development of fish comparative immunology has been hampered by the lack of specific markers for immunoregulatory peptides  <cit> . in this study at least  <dig> genes that significantly responded on the challenge of lps were detected and almost all of the genes could be classified as immune response-related genes. in addition, a reliable predictive of changes in gene expression with the est data in two libraries was confirmed by qpcr experiments; our study also showed that the expression of these genes was highly conserved between fish and mammals. therefore, these significantly differentially expressed genes might be considered as candidate markers of bacterial infections in spleen of the asian seabass. these genes provide the basis for further research into the identification of specific markers for immuno-regulatory peptides and for understanding the immune response of the asian seabass.

microsatellites and snps in immune-related ests
in this study, we identified  <dig> microsatellites and over  <dig> snps in immune-related ests. these markers could be used for many genetic studies  <cit> , such as linkage and qtl mapping  <cit> , examining population dynamics  <cit> , analyzing pedigree  <cit> , managing genetic diversity of broodstock  <cit>  and conducting comparative genome analysis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
by challenging asian seabass with bacterial lipopolysaccharide  and using suppression subtractive hybridization  technique and bioinformatic tools, we identified a large number of potential immune-related genes. some of which are vertebrate homologues and others are hitherto unreported putative defence proteins. these genes will supply us a solid basis for a better understanding of immunity in asian seabass, for conducting detailed functional analysis of these genes and for developing effective strategies for immune protection against infections in the asian seabass.
