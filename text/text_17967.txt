BACKGROUND
genes are regulated by sequence-specific dna-binding transcription factors and interacting partner proteins  <cit> . these physically interacting partners form complexes that are responsible for chromatin modifications. the swi-independent   <cit>    <cit>  corepressor serves as an essential scaffold for several proteins. by recruitment of histone deacetylases , it forms a deacetylase complex which generally catalyzes the silencing of the promoter  <cit> . sin <dig> can either interact directly with transcription factors or indirectly through adapter molecules like ncor  and/or smrt . the sin <dig> homologues have four evolutionarily conserved paired amphipathic helix  regions, a histone deacetylase interaction domain  and a highly conserved region   <cit> . an increasing number of nuclear proteins have been observed to interact with sin <dig> in a flexible manner. as a result, sin <dig> can both suppress and activate gene promoters  <cit> .

the sin <dig> family consists of sin3a and sin3b, which are highly homologous. human sin3b  contains  <dig>  amino acids, which share 90% identity with murine sin3b   <cit> . interactions between murine sin3a  and corepressor proteins such as the eto homologues have been reported  <cit> . the eto homologues include the transcriptional corepressors eto , mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig>  <cit> . msin3a has been shown to associate with eto  <cit> , but not with eto- <dig>  the murine homologue of mtg <dig>  <cit> . endogenously, eto is known to associate with msin3a, n-cor and hdacs  <cit> . however, interaction studies between hsin3b and the eto homologues have not yet been reported.

the eto homologues are evolutionarily related to the drosophila protein nervy, sharing four conserved regions: nervy homology regions  1– <dig>  <cit> . nhr <dig> and the flanking regions to nhr <dig> are required for the interaction of eto with msin3a  <cit> . the eto homologues do not bind directly to dna but rather repress transcription indirectly by binding to nuclear corepressor proteins such as ncor, smrt and msin3a  <cit> . obviously, msin3a is part of a corepressor complex that can include eto as one element. in the present work, we investigated whether hsin3b can also bind to the eto homologues.

both eto and mtg <dig> are known to carry out transcriptional repression as components of chimeric proteins generated by chromosomal translocations in certain subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia . the t gives rise to the aml1-eto fusion gene  <cit> , and the t gives rise to the aml1-mtg <dig> fusion gene  <cit> . the leukemia fusion proteins can recruit corepressors and hdacs, leading to dysregulated transcriptional repression that is responsible for a block in cell differentiation  <cit> . aml1-eto retains the dna-binding region of aml <dig>  but the transactivation domain is deleted. however, the eto partner of aml1-eto retains the conserved regions nhr1- <dig>  allowing interactions with corepressors. aml1-eto has been shown to interact with msin3a  <cit> .

additional studies of the interactions between different isoforms of sin <dig> and their partners in the transcriptional deacetylase complex may provide new knowledge about gene regulation. therefore, in the current study we examined the interactions of hsin3b with the eto homologues as well as with aml1-eto. our results demonstrate formation of complexes between hsin3b and selective eto homologues both upon ectopic coexpression in cos- <dig> cells and, more importantly, endogeneously in primary placenta cells and the k <dig> human erythroleukemia cell line. furthermore, immunolocalization studies showed that hsin3b and eto homologues colocalized to the nucleolus. our results suggest that hsin3b is a member of a corepressor complex involving specific eto homologues.

RESULTS
tissue and cell line expression of hsin3b and the eto homologues
first, an attempt was made to determine the general expression of hsin3b by investigating several tissues. results from rt-pcr showed hsin3b mrna to be expressed in all tissues and cell lines examined . because the transcript levels reach saturation during rt-pcr, the results may not reflect the true number of transcripts. therefore, we also carried out real-time pcr, which showed that hsin3b and eto homologues are ubiquitously expressed with a variable number of transcripts . the highest expression of hsin3b was found in thymus, placenta, pancreas, brain, heart and lung. in general, these tissues also had the highest expression of the eto homologues confirming earlier results  <cit> . furthermore, liver and muscle showed the lowest transcript levels for both hsin3b and the eto homologues. the other tissues showed no covariation between hsin3b and eto homologues.

hsin3b interacts with selective eto homologues
eto has previously been shown to be present in an endogeneous complex containing msin3a  <cit> . sin <dig> proteins are large and thus suitable for cooperation with multiple nuclear partners  <cit> . for these reasons, we investigated possible interactions between hsin3b and eto homologues. to determine this, transient transfections were carried out in cos- <dig> cells followed by ip-western analyses. control experiments showed that none of the antibodies used in these experiments  bound non-specifically . three independent experiments were performed and typical data is shown in fig.  <dig>  ip was performed with α-eto and western blotting with α-hsin3b on extracts from cells co-expressing hsin3b and eto. as a result, a protein of approximately  <dig> kda was pulled down, corresponding to the size of hsin3b . thus, eto co-precipitated hsin3b. the reciprocal ip-western experiment demonstrated that hsin3b co-precipitated eto as a  <dig> kda protein  further strengthening the conclusion that hsin3b and eto can form a complex. as hsin3b interacted with eto, we also investigated whether hsin3b can interact with the chimeric oncoprotein aml1-eto. however, hsin3b was not co-precipitated by aml1-eto and in the reverse experiment aml1-eto was not co-precipitated by hsin3b  indicating a lack of interaction. an interaction was also shown between hsin3b and mtg <dig> , but not between hsin3b and the eto homologue mtgr <dig> .

in order to confirm the specificity of these interactions experiments were also carried out using eto homologue constructs tagged with v <dig> and detected by anti-v <dig>  three independent experiments were performed by expression in cos- <dig> cells and typical data is shown in fig.  <dig>  hsin3b pulled down eto-v <dig> and mtg16-v <dig> but not mtgr1-v <dig> . in the reverse experiment eto-v <dig> and mtg16-v <dig> but not mtgr1-v <dig> pulled hsin3b , thus, the results confirmed the specificity of interaction between sin3b and eto homologues; sin3b interacted with eto and mtg <dig> but not with mtgr <dig>  from the present results, we conclude that hsin3b can form stable interactions with selective eto homologues, but not with aml1-eto.

we also tried to confirm the interactions between hsin3b and eto homologues in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. however, a repressor activity of the eto homologue constructs might have lowered the signals making it difficult to differentiate between interaction of the molecules in this system .

the eto domain nhr <dig> and the amino-terminus are required for interaction with hsin3b
of the four evolutionary conserved regions  of eto homologues, a region spanning from nhr <dig> to nhr <dig> has been described to associate with corepressors such as sin3a, n-cor and smrt  <cit> . similarly, we wanted to identify the regions of eto involved in the interaction with hsin3b. for this we used eto mutants lacking individual nhrs in cotransfection experiments in cos- <dig> cells. three independent experiments were performed and typical results are shown in fig.  <dig>  immunoprecipitation was performed with α-sin3b followed by western blotting with α-eto. deletion of nhr <dig> abrogated co-precipitation of the eto mutants by hsin3b . in contrast, deletion of nhr <dig>  nhr <dig> or nhr <dig> did not interfere with the formation of complexes with hsin3b . the expression of hsin3b was confirmed by performing ip-western with α-hsin3b , while the expression of eto mutants was confirmed by western blotting with α-eto .

the eto part of the leukemia fusion protein aml1-eto lacks  <dig> n-terminal aminoacids. therefore, it was important to determine whether these are important for the interaction with hsin3b. deletion of these amino acids from the amino terminal region of eto abrogated co-precipitation by hsin3b . the reciprocal experiment showed that this mutant did not co-precipitate hsin3b . full length eto was used a control to show normal interaction between hsin3b and eto . importantly, as evident from our previous result , aml1-eto was unable to bind to hsin3b. our data indicate that both the amino-terminal part and nhr <dig> of eto are required for the interaction with hsin3b.

endogeneous hsin3b co-immunoprecipitates eto
the previous conclusions on interactions between hsin3b and eto homologues are based on data from overexpression in cos- <dig> cells . therefore, it was important to confirm the interactions between endogeneous proteins. for this purpose cells from the central villous part of the placenta were isolated. results from western blotting showed that hsin3b and all the eto homologues are present in the placental cells . to investigate whether eto homologues were present in hsin3b associated nuclear complexes, we immunoprecipitated nuclear placental cell extracts with α-sin3b and performed western blotting using eto homologue specific antibodies. the reverse experiment was also carried out. the results show that eto pulled down a protein of approximately  <dig> kda, corresponding to hsin3b , and in the reverse experiment hsin3b pulled down a protein of approximately  <dig> kda, corresponding to eto . however, no co-immunoprecipitation was observed between hsin3b and mtgr <dig> or mtg <dig>  though input data confirm the presence of mtgr <dig> and mtg <dig> in ip lysates. we were not able to show input of hsin3b protein because of a low protein level in the lysate. our data show that hsin3b can interact with eto in primary placental cells.

immunolocalization and antibody specificity
the specificity of the peptide antibodies used against the eto homologues in immunoprecipitation and western blotting has been shown previously  <cit> . furthermore, in immunolocalization assays using cos- <dig> cells, antibodies for hsin3b  and eto homologues  were also shown to bind specifically to their respective antigens . α-mtg <dig> showed a faint background in non-transfected cells, probably due to a low endogenous expression of mtg <dig> in these cells . however, this antibody produced a strong fluorescence signal in cells overexpressing mtg <dig> . a quantitative analysis of the dapi stained cells showed the transfection efficiency for hsin3b and eto homologues to be 70–80% .

a total of  <dig> to  <dig> dapi stained cos- <dig> cells successfully transfected with hsin3b, eto homologues or aml1-eto were analyzed after probing with the respective antibodies. untransfected cells did not show antibody binding .

our data confirm that the antibodies to hsin3b and the eto homologues specifically detect their respective antigens in immunofluorescence studies.

nucleolar localization of hsin3b and eto homologues
a punctuate presence of all the eto homologues in nuclear particles has been reported  <cit> , and the presence of mtg <dig> in the nucleolus has also been reported  <cit> . nuclear particles are formed at the end of the cell cycle  <cit>  and are thought to migrate towards the nucleolar organizer region to fuse and aggregate into nuclear bodies, which eventually form nucleoli. b <dig> was used as a marker for nucleolar localization in cos- <dig> cells. three independent experiments were performed and typical data are shown in fig.  <dig>  cells expressing hsin3b showed a nucleolar colocalization with b <dig> . moreover, all the eto homologue transfected individually showed colocalization with b <dig> . however, aml1-eto was not found in nucleoli but only in nuclear particles .

a quantitative analysis of the data  showed that 80– <dig> % of successfully transfected cells displayed an antibody signal in the nucleus only. nucleoli  were observed in 11–20% of successfully transfected cells . approximately half of all nucleoli observed showed a signal for both hsin3b and the individual eto homologues judging by colocalization with b <dig>  thus, our data demonstrate that hsin3b and the eto homologues, but not aml1-eto, can be targeted to the nucleolus.

a total of  <dig> to  <dig> dapi stained cells successfully transfected with hsin3b, eto homologues or aml1-eto were analyzed. b- <dig> was used as a marker for nucleoli. a majority of these cells showed a nuclear signal. nucleoli were visible in 11–20% of the cells . the eto homologues showed a nucleolar localization in approximately half of these cells as. aml1-eto showed no nucleolar localization.

finally, we examined whether hsin3b colocalized with the eto homologues in the nucleolus. upon coexpression of hsin3b and eto, we observed colocalization of both these proteins in nuclear bodies , the matrix of the nucleolus  and at the periphery of the nucleolus . the colocalization between hsin3b and mtgr <dig> was not complete . thus, in some cells mtgr <dig> was present in nuclear particles  with or without colocalization with hsin3b at the periphery of these . complete colocalization was also observed between hsin3b and mtg <dig> in nuclear bodies , in the nucleolar matrix  and at the periphery of the nucleolus . no nucleolar colocalization was observed between hsin3b and aml1-eto  consistent with the lack of interaction between these proteins in ip-western experiments . a quantitative analysis of the data from cotransfection of hsin3b and eto homologues is shown in table  <dig>  a majority of cells showed nuclear colocalization . furthermore, significant colocalization was seen in nuclear bodies, nuclear particles and nucleoli. no colocalization was observed between hsin3b and aml1-eto.

a total of  <dig> to  <dig> dapi stained cos- <dig> cells successfully cotransfected with hsin3b  and eto homologues were analyzed. these cells were divided into % of cells showing nuclear colocalization, nucleolar colocalization, nuclear body colocalization and nuclear particle colocalization.

nucleolar localization of hsin3b and eto homologues in k <dig> cells
we confirmed the nucleolar colocalization between hsin3b and eto homologues observed upon overexpression in cos- <dig> cells  by studies of endogeneous proteins. the hel human erythroleukemia cell line is the only leukemic cell line that we know of that expresses transcripts for both hsin3b and all three eto homologues , but hsin3b was not detectable by immunoblotting in these cells . therefore, we used the k <dig> human erythroleukemia cell line instead although the data will be limited to mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> as this cell line does not express eto  <cit> . in support of this, immunoblotting showed the presence of hsin3b, mtgr <dig> and mtg <dig> but not eto . a nucleolar localization of sin3b, mtgr <dig> and mtg <dig> was observed , and hsin3b was shown to colocalize with mtgr <dig> and mtg <dig> . these observations strengthen our observations that hsin3b colocalizes with eto homologues, mtgr <dig> and mtg <dig> in the nucleolus.

discussion
the major role of sin <dig> proteins is to recruit hdacs, which catalyze deacetylation of histones leading to the creation of a repressive chromatin structure  <cit> . msin3a has been extensively studied as a corepressors, and is known to interact with eto homologues  <cit> . the following observations were made in the present work:  the corepressor hsin3b was shown to be ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and cell lines.  upon ectopic expression, hsin3b was shown to interact with eto and mtg <dig> but not with mtgr <dig> or aml1-eto.  in primary placenta cells, hsin3b was found to interact with eto but not with mtg <dig> or mtgr <dig>   a nucleolar localization of hsin3b and eto homologues was observed both for overexpressed proteins in cos- <dig> cells and endogenous proteins in the k <dig> leukemia cell line. collectively, the results suggest that hsin3b is a member of a chromatin-repressor complex involving selective eto homologues.

sin3a and sin3b differ in their interactions with eto homologues
the region of eto involved in binding to msin3a has been mapped to nhr <dig> and its flanking regions  <cit> . our data show that nhr <dig> is required for an interaction between hsin3b and eto. beyond this, our results also show a role for the amino-terminal part of eto for an interaction with hsin3b. this is consistent with the observed lack of an interaction between hsin3b and aml1-eto, which is devoid of the  <dig> amino-terminal residues present in wildtype eto  <cit> . however, not only the absence of these residues but also steric hindrance caused by the aml <dig> part of the chimeric aml1-eto protein could be important for lack of interaction.

interaction between hsin3b and selective eto homologues
the corepressor msin3a is known to interact with eto and mtgr <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to sin3a, we demonstrated interactions between hsin3b and eto or mtg <dig> but not mtgr <dig> in cos- <dig> cells by overexpression. the results of overexpression studies may not necessarily reflect protein interactions as they occur normally. interestingly, an interaction between hsin3b and eto was also detectable in primary cells from the villous part of the placenta. therefore, our results suggest a non-redundant interaction between hsin3b and eto homologues.

hsin3b and all the eto homologues show nucleolar targeting
a nuclear localization of eto homologues and aml1-eto has been reported previously  <cit> . furthermore, nucleolar targeting of mtg <dig> but not of eto and mtgr <dig> has been reported by hoogeveen et al.  <cit> . however, we observed all eto homologues as well as hsin3b to be targeted to the nucleolus upon overexpression in cos- <dig> cells . there are intrinsic problems associated with overexpression systems used for these studies wherein the type of plasmid and the efficiency of transfection may influence the results. importantly, we confirmed the nucleolar colocalization endogenously in the k <dig> human erytroleukemia cell line.

possible role of hsin3b and eto homologues in transcriptional inactivation
the periphery of the nucleolar chromatin ring contains a large number of inactive methylated rdna repeats  <cit> . mtg <dig> has been demonstrated to be localized at the nucleolar periphery and suggested to play a role in rdna silencing  <cit> . in addition, we observed eto as well as mtgr <dig> at the nucleolar periphery . likewise, we observed a peripheral nucleolar localization of hsin3b. furthermore, involvement of the sin <dig> corepressor complex in rdna silencing has been reported  <cit> . the presence of transcriptional repressors like hsin3b and eto homologues in the nucleolus could lead to transcriptional inactivation of rdna and a slowdown of cell proliferation  <cit> .

unlike sin3a, hsin3b does not interact with aml1-eto
aml1-eto is known to suppress aml1-responsive gene transcription  <cit> . aml1-eto has been shown to interact with msin3a  <cit> , but our data show that it does not interact with hsin3b. this seems to be explained by the deletion of the amino-terminus of eto in aml1-eto as an aminoterminal deletion of  <dig> aminoacids abrogated the interaction between eto and hsin3b. previous  <cit>  and present studies show lack of targeting of aml1-eto to the nucleolus. this is in contrast to the nucleolar targeting of eto. furthermore, upon coexpression with hsin3b, aml1-eto and eto showed separate nuclear localization . therefore our data suggest that aml1-eto is not a part of a possible hsin3b-associated complex.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data indicate that hsin3b is a potential member of a core repressor complex involving the eto homologues. the nhr <dig> domain of eto and its flanking regions are involved in making contact with the corepressor msin3a  <cit>  and our data suggests that nhr <dig> and the amino-terminus of eto are required for contact with hsin3b. this difference may be attributed to the difference in the structure of the pah <dig> domain of sin <dig> homologues  <cit> . we speculate that a corepressor complex involving eto homologues may contain either sin3a or sin3b. it is unlikely that both sin3a and sin3b are part of the same complex involving eto homologues. previous studies have shown that eto pulls down a complex of about  <dig> kda that contains msin3a, ncor and hdacs  <cit> . a nucleolar repressor complex of this limited size is unlikely to be able to hold both sin3a and sin3b, as both are large proteins. we propose a model in which a corepressor complex contains either hsin3a or hsin3b, but not both. the eto homologues of this complex may be interchangeable. finally, the finding of hsin3b as an interacting partner for specific eto homologues in the nucleolus suggests an epigenetic control of nucleolar transcriptional regulation.
