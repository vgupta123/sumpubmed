BACKGROUND
genome sequencing has historically been accomplished by fragmenting genomic dna, amplifying the fragments clonally using bacteria, and sequencing the amplified clones  <cit> . although this method has improved to the extent that much larger genomes can be sequenced, and some of the intermediate cloning steps can be circumvented  <cit> , practically all genome sequence until very recently has been generated by the sanger method. given the costs of sanger-based genome sequencing and surveys, significant amounts of genomic information for most of the  <dig>  eukaryotic species listed in the ncbi taxonomy database  <cit>  are unlikely to be available for some time. soybean , which is the subject of this study, has an existing but incomplete genome project. however, many crop plants, plant pathogens, endangered species and species of evolutionary interest have little or no available genome data. recently developed microbead technologies capable of sequencing hundreds of thousands of dna molecules in parallel provide a way to obtain genomic information from these species for reasonable cost, and without any bacterial cloning step. the method used here,  <dig> pyrosequencing, uses pyrophosphate release as a method for detection of base incorporation  <cit> . pyrosequencing has been used before to genotype snps in a polyploid plant, potato. however, the technology used  <cit>  relied on known primer sequences, greatly limiting the utility of the method for de novo sequencing. the  <dig> pyrosequencing method uses randomly sheared dna, has no requirement for known primer sequences , and makes sequence data faster and cheaper to obtain than sanger-based methods. however, the accuracy and read length of the method as used here is generally inferior to sanger-based sequencing of small clones  <cit> .

the first step in characterizing large genomes has frequently been a genome survey, often using end sequences of bacterial artificial chromosome  vectors  <cit> . such a survey gives important information about common repeat sequences, allows the generation of some genetic markers and helps determine the feasibility of building a bac tiling path. such surveys are limited, however, as representation of cloned sequences is likely to be somewhat skewed towards those that can be successfully propagated in bacterial vectors  <cit> . here we describe a method for performing high coverage, inexpensive and detailed genome surveys without the necessity of cloning, bacteria or vector libraries. the  <dig> pyrosequencing method described by margulies et al.  <cit>  allows access to randomly placed, short sequences in large numbers, without the generation of bacterial vectors or a cloning step. since  <dig> pyrosequencing produces relatively short reads, without paired end information, it is currently unsuitable for de novo sequencing of eukaryotic whole genomes. however, a high-coverage genome survey using this method can potentially deliver invaluable data about the makeup of a genome, quickly and at relatively low cost. in particular, the identification of sequences present in many copies per genome  is straightforward.

the soybean genome is relatively well-characterized, and significant progress has been made towards its completion. a survey of bac clone ends has been performed at relatively low coverage on the soybean genome  <cit> , and extensive sequencing of soybean ests has been performed  <cit> . however, a complete physical map is not yet available, and the amount of soybean genomic sequence in the public domain is still somewhat limited, although now growing rapidly. the survey described here provides further information about the makeup of the genome of this crop of great commercial importance.

RESULTS
sequencing of  <dig> million bases of random short reads from the soybean genome
genomic dna was extracted from purified nuclei isolated from leaves of soybean cv. williams. the dna was randomly sheared, and sequenced using the  <dig> pyrosequencing method  <cit> . this resulted in  <dig>  successful sequence reads, together with phred-equivalent quality  values  <cit> . mean read length of these filtered, trimmed reads was  <dig>  base pairs , with a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp of sequence generated. the soybean haploid genome size has been estimated at  <dig>  million base pairs   <cit> , therefore the filtered, trimmed reads used in this sequence survey represent an estimated 7% coverage of the soybean genome.

the 103-kb region surrounding the chs locus of soybean has been extensively characterized  <cit> . we utilized the sequence of this region to probe the genomic distribution and accuracy of the genomic survey sequences. using blat  <cit> ,  <dig> reads with 95% or higher identity across 98% or more of the read to this validated sequence were identified. these reads represent  <dig>  base pairs of sequence with an overall  <dig> % match to the validated sequence, hence there is a minimum estimated error rate of  <dig> %. the presence of slightly more than the expected number of matching reads within the pyrosequencing dataset provides evidence that the estimated genome size of soybean  <cit>  is approximately correct.

analysis of high-abundance sequences in soybean
repetitive sequences can confound both common methods for de novo genome sequencing: conventional, tiling-path based assembly strategies and shotgun genome sequencing approaches. consequently, we aimed to develop accurate repeat detection methods and comprehensive cataloging of repetitive sequences.

using the annotated tigr databases  <cit>  from multiple species, we are able to estimate the genomic copy number of all of the repeat classes in the tigr collection. these repeats may be detected either through similarity to glycine or to repeats known from other plant genomes, including the completed genomes of arabidopsis and oryza.

the tigr plant repeat database is composed largely of transposable element sequences and noncoding rna genes, and as with any database using incompletely sequenced genome data, it is incomplete. satellite sequences such as those detected in the assembly of our own soybean repeat database are under-represented in the tigr repeat database, despite their presence in genbank, and the types of repeat and organisms of origin of the sequences vary.

for each of the  <dig>  reads, we searched for a significant  blast  sequence match to the tigr plant repeat database, which is organized both by species of origin and class of element. figure 1a shows the percentage of reads with top hits that matched each species represented in the tigr database. the most abundant matches are those to repetitive elements already known to exist in glycine max. since the most abundant sequences in soybean are also the most likely to be well-characterized in this organism, this was an expected result. however, the database contains other legume repeat sequences:  <dig> sequences from lotus species,  <dig> from medicago species, as well as  <dig> from glycine species. we were surprised that the lotus and medicago matches were not more abundant. we speculate that this may be because the lotus, medicago and soybean sequences are mostly related, and hence the reads with a match to legume repeats generally have their best  match to the glycine sequences. note that most of the de novo detected repeats from our survey, including the sb <dig> and str <dig> satellites  database) and many retrotransposons described in additional file  <dig> , were not present in the tigr database.

relatively few reads matched the repeat database for arabidopsis. most of the reads similar to repeat sequences from other plants  had their most significant similarity to sequences from oryza or from brassica. brassica is more closely related to soybean than oryza, but has been the subject of very limited genomic sequencing, while oryza has been completely sequenced but is much more distantly related to soybean than brassica or arabidopsis. the result that there are more similarities between glycine repeats and oryza repeats, and between glycine and the known repeats from brassica, than to arabidopsis was therefore unexpected.

this analysis also allows description in broad terms of the abundance of transposable element sequence families in glycine, given the presence of related sequences in the database used for comparison. regardless of species of origin, a family was assigned to each soybean sequence read with a significant  blast  hit to the tigr plant repeat database. figure 1b gives an overview of the repeat composition of the soybean genome and an expected minimum genome copy number for each element type found in the database used. again, we cannot expect the reference database to be in any way complete, so no conclusions regarding absent sequences can be made. we estimate that the soybean genome contains a minimum of just over  <dig>  transposable elements of types named and present in the tigr repeat database; many more "unclassified repetitive" sequences that have similarity to sequences in this dataset  are present. one result that arises from this analysis is that while retrotransposons are common in the soybean genome, type ii transposons are likely to be relatively rare . more noteworthy was that no hits were observed to mule  transposons in the tigr collection. it is likely therefore that soybean mules are sufficiently divergent in sequence from any mules in the tigr repeat database that they are not detected by a blast  search. conversely, while mites  were not previously present in the tigr soybean repeat database, sequences with hits to mite elements from other organisms in the tigr plant repeats are present in many different classes, indicating the presence of several mite families in the soybean genome.

de novo detection of abundant sequences in the soybean genome
identification of repetitive elements using high throughput survey sequencing is not limited to sequence homology searches to known repeats from other genomes. repeats can also be identified based on their over-representation in the data set. by clustering non-cognate, overlapping dna sequence fragments using phrap  <cit>  we were able to identify a comprehensive set of sequences present in many copies in the soybean genome. the expected number of cognate contigs obtained by sequencing 7% of a non-repetitive genome was calculated according to lander and waterman  <cit> . since 7% of the genome was sequenced, assembly into non-cognate contigs allows detection of sequences present in  <dig> copies or more per genome. the observed excess of overlapping sequences from phrap assembly was used to estimate the relative amount of repetitive dna present in  <dig> or more copies in the soybean genome. these calculations are summarized in table  <dig>  note that most  of the predicted repetitive sequence is in contigs that contain more than seven reads, all of which are likely non-cognate since none are expected to be generated by chance from non-repetitive dna. in total, approximately 41% of the total reads in the survey  were found to form contigs only expected to assemble if the underlying sequence is present in multiple copies . we thus estimate that 41% of the soybean genome is present in more than  <dig> copies per haploid set. most of these repeats  are present in  <dig> or more copies. this estimate is in strong agreement with past dna re-association kinetics , which predict that 30–45% of the soybean genome consists of highly repetitive dna, with the total repeat content in the range of 40–60%  <cit> . however, unlike cot measurements, this method gives access to the underlying sequence of the detected repeats.

our assembly yielded  <dig>  predicted repetitive contigs . the missouri repeat database  <cit>  contains  <dig> sequences, the soybase.org collection  <cit>   <dig>  repeats, and the tigr glycine repeat database  <cit>   <dig> sequences. using blast with an e value cutoff of 1e- <dig>  we determined that our repeat database contains  <dig>  repeats with no similar sequences in the missouri collection,  <dig>  repeats with no similar sequences in the soymap.org collection, and  <dig>  with no similar sequences present in the tigr glycine repeat database .

the most abundant repetitive sequences which assembled into higher-order sequence structures were the  <dig> bp repeat family ; these are present in multiple distinct contigs of higher-order repeats . in total,  <dig>  reads, or  <dig> % of the soybean genome sequence, are contained in sb92-like higher-order repeats. however, the published sb <dig> repeat sequence, which is found in centromeres as well as other genomic locations in the annual soybeans  <cit>  matches only  <dig>  reads by blast . this indicates the variability of the repeat units within the higher-order contigs, many of which are not close enough to the published, canonical sb <dig> sequence to match it in our blast search. this is consistent with observations  <cit>  that the sb <dig> repeat has a high level of sequence diversity. a total of  <dig> contigs contain sb92-like sequences , but these sequences do not assemble into a single unit. this indicates that distinct subtypes and higher-order structures of this satellite sequence are present in the soybean genome.

in addition to a large number of satellite repeats, we detected novel transposable elements  comparison to the tigr repeat database above, presumably because no similar elements are present in that collection). these elements correspond to  <dig> different classes, including both type i and type ii transposons. in support of the hypothesis that mules do in fact exist in the soybean genome, we detected two mules in our de novo soybean repeat assembly. these mule elements have contig ids  <dig>  and  <dig> .

the  <dig> most abundant sequences detected by assembly of the survey data, the number of reads encoding each, and the percentage of the genome that each is predicted to represent, are summarized in additional file  <dig>  note that the list is dominated by sb <dig> repeats, str <dig> satellites and calypso/diaspora type retrotransposons. the full list of assembled repeats is available online  <cit> . an estimated genomic copy number is given, based on the size of the contig and the number of reads it contains . however, we are unable to determine from our survey whether these sequences actually occur in the stated copy number as contiguous units, or whether fragments of these sequences may occur in separate locations. the copy number is our best estimate of the relative abundance of these high-copy-number sequences.

we have compiled and curated the multiple copy sequences discovered using the above sequencing approach and phrap assembly into a soybean repeat database, available from the authors' web site  <cit> .

using survey data for genomic copy number analysis
assuming that sequences in our genomic dna survey are sampled without bias for particular sequence types, the genomic dataset provides a method of estimating the copy number of any genomic sequence. since the reads are shorter than sanger sequencing reads, the same amount of sequence provides a higher sampling rate throughout the genome. a 7% coverage survey with  <dig>  bp reads provides  <dig>  reads per  <dig> kb of single copy sequence. by comparison, a sanger-based survey with  <dig> bp reads, and with no read pairing, would have a sampling rate of  <dig> fragment/ <dig> kb at 7% coverage. since most sanger sequencing is done using read pairs, this would further reduce the effective sampling rate to one read pair  per  <dig> kb of genomic sequence. hence, the  <dig> pyrosequencing survey data can be used to estimate the copy number of any  <dig> kb window of genomic sequence with relative accuracy, as well as detect high-copy-number sequences accurately across much shorter windows. we utilized the sequence of the chs region, used earlier to probe the accuracy of the genomic survey sequences, to demonstrate the utility of this approach to detect repeats. the chs sequence is extensively annotated at the gene level but not previously annotated for noncoding repetitive regions, since no databases of repeats were available to the authors of that study  <cit> . the survey reads with substantial identity to this region were identified with blat, then assembled to the genomic sequence backbone, and further inconsistent matches were excluded using a blastz  <cit>  alignment . the resulting alignment consists of closely related, but not necessarily directly cognate sequences, since repetitive sequences from other genomic regions are intended to assemble with the repetitive regions in the query sequence, allowing them to be visualized. since approximately 7% of the genome was sequenced, approximately 7% coverage is expected for single-copy sequences, and higher coverage indicates repeated regions. expected copy number can thus be calculated from the coverage of each sequence window across the alignment. many regions would be expected to be present in two or more copies as a result of the history of the soybean genome, which involves relatively recent duplication  <cit> . using the laj viewer  <cit>  and scripts written in-house  <cit>  , we created graphical views of the alignment. the resulting graphic  shows the superimposition of the microbead reads matching the bac sequence containing the 103-kb region surrounding the chs locus. this clearly defines regions of the bac that are present in multiple copies per genome, and shows estimated copy number of these regions. we repeated this analysis with two more bacs, gm_wbb0078a <dig> and gm_wbb0098n <dig>  available from the soymap.org site  <cit> . neither bac had any associated annotation at the time of writing. the bac clone gm_wbb0078a <dig> is derived from a pericentromeric region, whereas gm_wbb0098n <dig> is from a euchromatic region of the genome . the two euchromatic bacs  have a similar appearance – low or single copy regions form most of the sequence, and they are interspersed by sequences that are found in tens, hundreds or thousands of copies, such as stretches of satellite repeats or transposable elements. in contrast, the pericentromeric sequence is composed to large extent of sequences that are present in hundreds or thousands of copies . note that some regions of the pericentromeric bac are estimated to be present in few copies, possibly as few as one copy, per genome. this approach is thus potentially useful for detecting unique, possibly genic regions within sequences that are largely repetitive.

in addition to developing a database of repetitive sequences, we have developed a graphical tool for alignment of any sequence to the raw read data, to allow the detection of repetitive regions. the whole-genome copy number of sequence fragments from bac or other genomic clones can be assessed using the search and alignment viewer, which is available at the authors' web site  <cit> .

higher-order structure of repeats within satellite sequence
we were able to assemble some of the smaller, tandem satellite repeats detected in our survey  into non-cognate but deeply sequenced higher-order units using the data from our high-coverage survey. other sequences, such as retrotransposons, were assembled into a single unit. in order to validate the assembly of selected assembled abundant sequences, both single unit and higher-order satellite, we used pcr amplification to determine the presence of a block of the predicted size in the genome, and used conventional sequencing to confirm the identity of the fragment. three such amplicons, two higher-order satellite sequences and one putative retroelement, were amplified from genomic dna to provide validation of the non-cognate assembly data. the pcr fragments are shown in additional file  <dig>  the fragments from contig  <dig>  and contig  <dig>  were cloned and the fragment ends sequenced from vector primers. the fragment from contig  <dig>  was refractory to cloning, and was sequenced in part directly from the gel-purified pcr product using the amplification primers. all sequences matched the contig assembled from the  <dig> sequence survey, with some base mismatches. fragments  <dig> and  <dig> matched their predicted contigs with > 95% sequence identity across the sequenced length in a global pairwise alignment. no sequence was 100% identical to the predicted contig, probably due to the degeneracy between similar repeats expected in vivo. fragment  <dig> was more divergent to our predicted sequence, with a blast match at > 95% identity but an overall identity of 87% to the predicted contig in a global pairwise alignment. we attribute this to a higher level of degeneracy within this higher-order repeat family in vivo, with the cloned fragment being divergent from the most common sequence predicted by the genome survey.

analysis of conceptual translations from randomly generated genomic reads
the average read size of our survey was  <dig>  bp, giving a maximum average open reading frame size of  <dig> amino acids. consequently, reads that are derived completely from exonic sequence are a potential source of partial protein sequence. the gmgi database v.  <dig>  was used to estimate our survey's coverage of coding regions of the genome  <cit> . this contains  <dig>  sequences with an average length of  <dig> base pairs. a blast  search was performed with each gmgi sequence as a query and the survey reads as a database, with an expect value cutoff of 1e- <dig>  figure 3a shows the number of soybean ests with 95% or higher nucleotide level sequence matches to the raw reads,  <dig>  of  <dig> , or 37%. since seven percent of the genome was covered with average  <dig>  base pair reads, we expect approximately 37% of the ests known from soybean to have hits to the genomic reads. this concordance provides further evidence of the unbiased random sampling of genomic sequence by our sequencing method, and further evidence that the genome size estimate of  <dig>  megabases of arumaganthan and earle  <cit>  is approximately correct.

in addition to sequences that have hits to the gmgi est collection, a number of reads contained open reading frames with blast hits to known proteins from other organisms, but no hits to soybean ests or other soybean sequences. figure 3b shows the distribution of coding fragments with an open reading frame giving a 1e- <dig> or lower blast  e value to the nr database, and the taxonomy of the organism from which the closest sequence in that database was generated. this demonstrates the coverage of the existing est collection, with over 50% of protein sequence derived from survey reads matching glycine proteins that are already known. in total,  <dig>  of the survey reads were identified as derived from likely conserved protein coding regions  hits to the nr database); 41% of the identified protein fragments have no detectable similarity to known soybean protein sequences, giving over  <dig>  potential novel soybean protein fragments with similar, conserved protein sequences known from other organisms.

discussion
comparison of  <dig> survey sequences to previously sequenced bac clones can reveal regions of multiple-copy sequence and allow approximate quantitation of copy number. since no bacterial cloning is necessary, a significant advantage of this approach is that repetitive sequences which are refractory to cloning in e. coli  <cit>  can be characterized without a cloning step.

it is possible to use the survey sequences to reconstruct a representative dataset of soybean highly-repetitive sequences in silico on a whole-genome scale, because sequences which assemble with 7% genome coverage will almost all be present in multiple copies. using this method  <dig>  multi-copy sequences were found, of which  <dig>  are estimated to be present in  <dig> or more copies per genome. these sequences include transposons, satellites, putative centromeric and telomeric repeats  and multi-copy genes such as those for ribosomal rna. we have collated, curated and annotated these repeat sequences and developed an on-line database where these sequences can be accessed and searched, and we believe they have utility and biological interest in addition to the detection of repeats for genome assembly. for example, since mules can be domesticated to perform conserved developmental tasks  <cit>  it is possible the mules detected using this survey in soybean will be of broader biological interest.

exclusion of these multi-copy sequences and low-complexity simple repetitive dna gives a dataset of "low or single-copy" dna sequences that can be potentially used to derive genetic markers in subsequent experiments. agreement with previous cot measurements  <cit>  provides evidence of a lack of bias in genomic sampling using the  <dig> sequencing procedure, thus it is possible that high-coverage surveys will be able to detect single-copy regions with greater accuracy than current methods.

of the  <dig>  repeats discovered in our survey, an interesting class are the higher-order repeats composed of slightly divergent repeat units of between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides. this class represents many of the most abundant repeats in soybean . eukaryotic centromeres are typically composed of satellite sequences with a repeat frequency of between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, or approximately the amount of dna required to fold around a nucleosome  <cit> . two  <dig> bp repeats  form a repeat unit of  <dig> bp, making these sequences a candidate for a centromeric or pericentromeric satellite. such satellite sequences, while conserved in size, are highly variable in sequence even within a plant species  <cit>  and show more rapid evolutionary change than euchromatic sequences  <cit>  – consequently it is expected that soybean repeats show little sequence similarity to those known in arabidopsis and its relatives . in humans  <cit>  and in arabidopsis  <cit>  centromeric repeats have been shown to consist of higher order arrays, composed of closely related yet divergent nucleosomal repeat monomers. our short-read sequencing data allows global analysis of such higher-order structures within abundant satellite dna, and several sequences in additional file  <dig> and the repeat database  <cit>  represent such higher order repeat families, producing contigs between  <dig>  and  <dig>  base pairs in length. speculatively, therefore, some of these sequences may represent novel centromeric repeats. these relatively large, high-copy-number satellite repeats are difficult to access by other means, and are often not included even in "completed" genomes such as arabidopsis  <cit>  because of difficulties in obtaining or assembling bac clones. a detailed catalog of these higher-order repeats is an important product of the survey approach we describe. knowledge of these higher order sequences provides both a screen for clones containing such problem sequences, and potentially a method to generate more detailed knowledge of tandem repetitive regions such as centromeres or telomeres.

in a genome such as soybean, where substantial est sequencing has been performed, but the genome itself is not completely sequenced, the genomic survey data can also provide estimates of the copy number of any genes characterized at the molecular level. copy number of genes is known to affect agronomically relevant traits in soybean, such as allergenicity  <cit> . in addition to gene copy number estimation, detailed knowledge of repeat sequences, and the ability to screen these sequences from any shotgun genome sequencing dataset, are of significant value to any sequencing and assembly project. while our survey was aimed primarily at investigating repetitive sequences, we also generated some data on partial protein-coding sequences. most of the sequences we discover with hits to known proteins, but not to known soybean proteins, are likely to represent the regions of incomplete coverage within transcripts partially covered by known ests. it is also possible that some of our short sequences are not of sufficient length to generate significant hits. however, some hits from non-plant eukaryotes, bacteria and viruses are seen. these sequences may indicate the presence of a small number of coding sequences in soybean without homology in the completely sequenced plant genomes. we cannot exclude the possibility that our sequences are too short to generate significant scoring alignments with some orthologous plant proteins. it is also possible that these sequences result from microbial dna contamination, or that homologous proteins exist within, for example arabidopsis or rice but that these proteins have not been annotated and placed in the nr database. the utility of such a coding region fragment discovery project includes the potential to design microarray probes to coding sequences that may not be present even in detailed est sequence sets.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed and validated a method for genomic survey sequencing; a high-coverage, short-read genome survey using  <dig> pyrosequencing. this method provides no de novo assembled sequence, and is not a replacement for conventional shotgun genomic sequencing, or for est sequencing. however, rapid sequencing of many short genomic fragments gives a clear picture of overall genome composition. given the much lower cost of the method when compared to sanger-based whole-genome sequencing or est sequencing, it can provide a substantial amount of information as a preliminary step to characterize large, unsequenced genomes.

even much higher coverage sequencing of soybean, using random short reads of the size described here, would be unlikely to allow the assembly of a complete genome sequence. short sequence fragments, together with the extensive repeats we describe, would cause insoluble difficulties in whole-genome assembly. however, a  <dig> pyrosequencing genome survey allows the derivation of many types of valuable information, including repeat composition, genome size and genomic copy number. higher coverage would further increase the value of this type of survey, in particular the coverage of single-copy protein-coding sequences. ultimately, advances in read length , and the availability of paired reads, could make possible true whole-genome shotgun sequencing of soybean and other crop plants at greatly reduced cost.
