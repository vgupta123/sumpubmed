BACKGROUND
environmental stresses exert evolutionary pressure on organisms, which, in turn, have developed sophisticated responses to cope and to survive. plants react to unfavorable conditions by dynamically changing physiological behavior and expression levels of implicated genes. pre-exposure to various abiotic stresses  may alter plants’ subsequent responses by improving resistance to future exposures
 <cit> . pre-treatment  with hormones  increased the systemic immunity and induced stronger responses from responding genes upon subsequent treatments, relative to non-primed plants
 <cit> . these observations have led to the concept of ‘stress memory’, implying that during subsequent exposures plants provide responses that are different from their responses during the first encounter with the stress
 <cit> .

drought-triggered dehydration stress is one of the most common environmental stresses endured by plants and their responses to dehydration stress are extensively researched at organismal, cellular, and genome levels. recently, we demonstrated that arabidopsis plants subjected to several cycles of dehydration/water recovery treatments maintained higher relative water content than plants experiencing dehydration stress for the first time
 <cit> . dehydration stress ‘memory’ also affected gene expression from response genes. analysis of  <dig> dehydration response genes after multiple stress treatments revealed the existence of two different types of transcriptional responses: genes that produced transcripts at similar levels during each stress and genes that in a subsequent response significantly increased their transcript levels and transcription rates relative to the first response
 <cit> . accordingly, genes that provide altered responses in a subsequent stress were referred to as ‘memory genes’ to distinguish them from ‘non-memory’ genes responding similarly to each stress.

here, we explore how broadly memory genes are distributed within the dehydration stress responsive fraction of the arabidopsis thaliana genome. comprehensive rna-seq analyses of the transcriptomes of plants prior to stress, during a first stress, and during a third dehydration stress exposure revealed an unexpected diversity of memory-type responses at the transcriptional level. analyses of the memory genes by go functional categories indicated a biased functional distribution among the memory response patterns. results are interpreted in the context of the possible biological relevance of these memory responses.

methods
plant growth and treatments
arabidopsis thaliana  plants were grown in potting soil in growth rooms at 22°c with a 12-h light photoperiod and light intensity of 180 μmol m-2 s- <dig>  repeated dehydration stresses were performed by air-drying for 2 h followed by a 22 h period of full re-hydration recovery as described
 <cit> . rna-seq analyses were performed on rosette leaves from pre-stressed  plants, from plants exposed to the first dehydration treatment , and during a third stress  following two stress/recovery cycles. plants from two independent biological samples were used. after removal from soil and before initiating the stress/recovery cycle, experimental plants were conditioned overnight in humid chambers and used to establish the basal transcript levels  for the transcriptome analyses. the transcriptional behavior of the marker memory genes rd29b and rab <dig> were monitored in leaf samples taken from fresh plants in soil, from overnight conditioned plants after their removal from soil, and from plants kept under watered conditions throughout the stress/recovery as indicators of the normal dehydration stress behavior of plants in s <dig> and s <dig> and internal controls for the whole genome transcriptome analyses.

rna extraction and rna-seq library construction
leaf tissues were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. total rna was extracted with trizol , treated with dnase i , and purified using qiagen rneasy mini kit. rna integrity was confirmed on a bioanalyzer  <dig> using nano  <dig> labchip . complementary dna sequencing library was prepared from the total rna using the mrna-seq sample preparation kit . briefly, poly-adenylated rna was isolated from 10 μg total rna by sera-mag magnetic oligo-dt beads . rna purified mrna was fragmented, annealed to high concentrations of random hexamers, and reverse transcribed. following second strand cdna synthesis, end repair, and a-tailing, oligo adapters complementary to sequencing primers were ligated to cdna fragment ends. resultant cdna libraries were size fractionated on an agarose gel, 200 bp fragments excised, and amplified by  <dig> cycles of polymerase chain reaction. clusters were generated from the cdna sequencing library on the surface of a flowcell in the cluster station  by so-called bridge amplification. replicates for the watered, s <dig> and s <dig> sample libraries were each run on a single lane in a flowcell on an illumina gaiix at the genomics core facility at the university of nebraska-lincoln.

reverse transcription and real-time pcr
total rna isolation and reverse transcription with oligo  were performed as described previously
 <cit> . the amounts of individual genes were measured with gene-specific primers by real-time pcr analysis with a cycleriq real-time pcr instrument  and sybr green mixture . the relative expression or amount of specific genes was quantitated with the 2-ΔΔct calculation
 <cit> , according to the manufacturer’s software , where the reference gene was ubiquitin. primers used in real-time rt-pcr are in additional file

bioinformatics analysis
transcriptome sequencing of the watered, s <dig>  and s <dig> samples yielded a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  million reads, respectively, summed over the two biological replicates per sample . the read length for s <dig> and s <dig> is  <dig> bases, while for watered it is  <dig> bases. to determine the quality of the replicates we performed a least-square simple linear regression for each of the three samples. we calculated the r
2
 statistic  and slope , which provide measures of goodness-of-fit and correlation, respectively, using the regress function in matlab®  . for use in all further analyses, the arabidopsis thaliana genome and gene models were downloaded from illumina’s igenomes , and gene functional descriptions and gene ontology assignments from the arabidopsis information resource .

the bowtie  and tophat  packages were used with default parameters to map the rna sequence reads from watered, s <dig>  and s <dig> to the genome , and to determine the expression quantity of known transcripts in each sample. the cuffdiff tool from the cufflinks package  was run with default parameters to calculate expression changes and associated q-values  for each gene, between the samples s <dig> and water, and s <dig> and s <dig>  we further classify genes as being significantly differentially expressed when all three of the following conditions are met: q ≤  <dig> ; | log <dig> | ≥ 1; and the fpkm-normalized expression value of at least one sample out of the two needs to be larger than the 25th percentile. the output files of cuffdiff are further annotated  by adding gene functional descriptions and go classifications, and merged into a master file containing all data for s <dig> versus water and s <dig> versus s <dig> .

from that master file we determined the  <dig> significant drought-responsive genes , and using that initial set we then looked at the significant responses in s <dig> versus s <dig>  and the remainder that did not respond . we assigned simple classifications to the types of response during the first stress  and the second stress , combining them into six classes: , , , , , and  . two additional classes  and  contain genes that in s <dig> did not change significantly expression  compared to pre-stressed levels in w but significantly changed transcription in s <dig>  formally, these genes do not belong to the s <dig> dehydration-stress responding fraction.

RESULTS
dehydration stress memory response genes of arabidopsis thaliana
watered non-stressed plants and plants subjected to one or three dehydration stresses by exposure to dry air for  <dig> hours followed by 22 h periods of watered recovery intervals
 <cit>  were analyzed. the levels of mrnas from the leaves of these plants were determined by rna-seq. transcripts from  <dig>  a. thaliana genes were identified . of these,  <dig> genes  significantly increased or decreased their transcript levels during the first dehydration stress , compared to their transcript levels in watered plants , representing the dehydration stress-responsive genes of a. thaliana. of the genes responding in s <dig>   <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . a comparison of the transcript levels during the first  and third dehydration stress  identified  <dig>  dehydration responsive genes displaying significantly different amounts of transcripts in s <dig> versus s <dig>  our operational criterion for transcriptional memory is that the transcriptional responses to similar stress conditions must be different. accordingly, these  <dig>  genes display dehydration stress transcriptional memory .

four distinct transcriptional memory response-patterns were recognized within the s1-responding fraction. we designate these transcription patterns as , ,  and  memory responses, where the first sign indicates higher  or lower  transcript levels in s <dig> relative to the levels in pre-stressed watered plants . the second sign indicates higher  or lower  transcripts in s <dig> relative to the levels in s <dig>  non-memory genes are denoted as  or  indicating that up-regulated or down-regulated transcript levels occurring in s <dig>  respectively, have similar levels in s <dig>  in addition,  <dig> genes were up-regulated in s <dig>  and  <dig> were down-regulated . these delayed response patterns are different from the memory responses represented by the four s1-responding memory types. here, we focus mainly on the transcriptional patterns of the s1-responding gene fraction of arabidopsis.

of the four different memory classes,  <dig> genes denoted as  memory genes were induced in s <dig> and induced to higher levels in s <dig> . all  <dig> memory genes described in our earlier study
 <cit>  were present in the  memory category in the genome-wide rna-seq data . the  class contained  <dig> genes with decreased transcript levels in s <dig> and further reduced levels in s <dig> . the  class contained  <dig> memory genes that were down-regulated in s <dig>  but produced significantly higher transcript levels in s <dig> ; conversely,  <dig>  memory genes, were induced in s <dig> but had lower levels in s <dig> . the latter two categories ‘revise’ their transcriptional behavior in a subsequent stress: after robustly responding in s <dig>  these genes show weaker/no responses in s <dig>  producing transcripts at levels close to their initial watered  levels. these genes are referred to as ‘revised response’ memory genes. the distribution of transcript levels for the dehydration stress-responsive memory genes in s <dig> and s <dig> illustrating the four memory categories is shown . the two non-memory gene classes  consistently provide transcriptional responses in s <dig> similar to those in s <dig> .

functional distribution of arabidopsis memory genes
the large number of the dehydration stress-memory responsive genes and the diversity of their transcriptional responses raised questions of their functions and of whether there was a preferential association of particular cellular functions with any of the four memory types. to address these questions, genes displaying transcriptional memory were analyzed for biological function according to their gene ontology  classification .

genes involved in aba/abiotic stresses responses are signature for the  memory genes
genes implicated in responses to salt, salinity, cold/heat acclimation, and abscisic acid  constitute about a quarter of the  memory genes. lea genes represent 3% among them .

ribosome/protein synthesis, chloroplast, and thylakoid membrane associated functions are signature for  memory genes
memory genes encoding ribosomal, as well as chloroplast and photosynthesis proteins are the major constituents of the  memory subgroup . encoded proteins are involved in ribosome structure and amino acid biosynthesis, as well as in photosynthesis, in the light harvesting complex , and in responses to light . the largest number of thylakoid membrane-associated proteins is encoded by  memory genes.

functions encoded by  revised response memory genes
there are no particular types of cellular functions specifically enriched within the  group of memory genes, although the largest percentages of genes encode chloroplast and membrane  related functions. many of these are for electron transport, photosystem ii assembly, chloroplast organization and re-location, functions similar to those encoded by  memory genes .

dehydration stress  memory genes are shared with multiple signaling pathways
the signature  dehydration memory genes are regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including the aba, ethylene, auxin , gibberrellic acid , jasmonic acid , and salicylic acid  pathways . a prominent functional group represented by  memory genes encodes proteins associated with membranes. although membrane -related genes are highly represented within the entire drought-responding fraction , genes for tonoplast intrinsic proteins regulating water transport  and the inward k+ channel proteins  display, exclusively,  memory responses .

dehydration stress memory of transcription factor genes
among the ~ <dig> arabidopsis genes encoding transcription factors 
 <cit> , members of about two dozen families have been implicated in responses to drought
 <cit> . among these families, transcriptional memory behavior was found for members of ten of the families . five families  are represented in all memory categories; gras and hsf members display only  and  memory, and the caat family is represented only by  memory genes. tf genes are least represented in the  memory subgroup .

 memory genes for myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig>  athb- <dig>  athb- <dig>  and abf <dig> specifically cluster with aba/abiotic stress responding genes but are rarely found among other hormonally responsive pathways ; six putative tf genes display  memory type responses and only three are shared with other response pathways . tfs with  or  revised response memory behavior are broadly shared with multiple abiotic and hormone response networks, outlining distinct clusters .

discussion
biological relevance of the transcription memory behavior
plants experience more dehydration stress during the day when transpiration exceeds the rate of water uptake and fully, or partially, recover during the night when the rate of water uptake exceeds the greatly diminished loss of water from leaves
 <cit> . this creates a diurnal cycle of oscillating leaf water potential that is probably most pronounced during periods of moderate drought conditions
 <cit> . the repetitive dehydration stress system employed in this study has similarities to this natural diurnal stress. we hypothesize that dehydration stress memory helps plants to prepare for the next day’s stress if they were stressed the day before, despite alleviated stress signals during the night
 <cit> .

genes displaying transcriptional memory are among the genes responding to the first dehydration stress. altering their expression levels in subsequent stresses, presumably, allows the plant to finely tune its responses to ongoing/recurring dehydration stress. the possible biological relevance of the genes displaying transcriptional memory is considered in the context of four overlapping strategies generally employed by a plant to improve its stress tolerance and/or survival: 1) increased synthesis of membrane protecting, damage-repairing, and detoxifying functions; 2) coordinating photosynthesis and growth under repetitive stress; 3) re-adjusting osmotic and ionic equilibrium to maintain homeostasis
 <cit> ; and 4) re-adjusting interactions between dehydration and other stress/hormone regulated pathways
 <cit> .

increased synthesis of protective functions
in general, the proteins encoded by  memory genes are involved in cell protective roles. these include heat shock proteins and chaperons, proteins involved in the repair of stress-induced damages to membranes, in modifying membrane lipid composition, in regulating membrane fluidity and permeability to toxic ions, dehydrins , and lipid transfer proteins 
 <cit> . lea  proteins functioning as molecular chaperones to maintain membrane structures, ion balance and homeostasis
 <cit>  and enzymes for the synthesis of isoleucine , serine , and proline  are encoded by  memory genes. thereby,  memory genes ensure elevated synthesis of factors critical for cell survival under multiple dehydration stresses .

abscisic acid  is the key mediator of dehydration signaling and is involved in responses to other abiotic stress response pathways
 <cit> . aba responsive genes that respond to dehydration are often points of overlap in various abiotic stress pathways
 <cit>  . the  memory and  non-memory genes, generally, encode proteins with similar protective functions. however, the memory component, presumably, allows the plant to optimize its stress tolerance within the context of protection. only a few  memory genes and a smaller number of down-regulated  genes are shared between dehydration/aba and other abiotic stress responding systems .

photosynthesis and growth during repeated stresses
more than 40% of the  memory genes encode ribosome/protein synthesis, chloroplast, and thylakoid membrane related proteins indicating repetitive stress results in a stronger attenuation of the pathways for photosystem ii electron transport, small rubisco subunit and sugar biosynthesis, as well as for ribosome assembly, protein translation, dna replication and histones . none of the  memory genes encodes a thylakoid membrane function. of note,  <dig>  memory genes associated with chloroplasts encode functions that are different, even opposite to, the functions encoded by the  memory genes. chlorophyll and toxin catabolic enzymes, enzymes for the synthesis of isoleucine , serine , and proline  are encoded by  memory genes. photosynthetic and starch synthesizing activities, in addition to proteins involved in chloroplast organization and relocation, are encoded by  memory genes. down-regulated  non-memory genes encode ribosome- and chloroplast-associated proteins as well . the functional implications of the  transcriptional response patterns  and the protective functions by the  memory genes are in agreement with known responses of plants enduring dehydration stress
 <cit> . of note, on the background of a rather even distribution of go functions encoded by the late responding  and  genes, the fraction of genes encoding chloroplast and thylakoid membrane proteins constitute ~ 20% among the  genes .

re-adjusting cellular homeostasis
the  and  revised memory genes respond robustly to the initial stress, but in a subsequent exposure provide responses at levels closer to their non-stressed levels. presumably, these genes help in restoring homeostasis as the plant adjusts to dehydration stress. thus,  memory genes for chloroplast organization, relocation, photosynthetic, light harvesting, and metabolic functions are similar to the functions encoded by the  memory genes . however, by producing significantly more transcripts in s <dig> than in s <dig>  or returning to pre-stressed  levels in s <dig> , these genes support the ability of plants to restore photosynthesis after temporary water withdrawal
 <cit> . presumably, the  genes contribute to an initial decrease in chloroplast/photosynthetic activity in s <dig>  but by reverting to pre-stressed transcription levels in s <dig>  contribute to a subsequent re-adjustment. the  memory genes glk <dig> and glk <dig>  implicated in regulating the photosynthetic apparatus and chloroplast development in a cell-autonomous manner
 <cit>  are candidate genes for a role in such an adjustment.

within the same go category,  and  memory genes may encode opposing biochemical activities. for example, a number of the  memory genes encode chlorophyll and carbohydrate  synthesizing enzymes, while chlorophyll and starch degrading activities are encoded by  memory genes . juxtaposing these functions would suggest complementary roles during both the initial and repeated stresses. acting together, these genes are likely to decrease overall chlorophyll and starch biosynthesis during the first stress but to partially restore it during subsequent stresses. these complementary transcriptional patterns and functional roles support the fine coordination occurring between metabolic and energy adjustments during adaptation to drought
 <cit> .

membrane-associated memory genes present another paradigm of biological relevance for the dehydration memory genes. as dehydration may damage membrane integrity, it is not surprising that a large number of genes  encode functions related to membranes; more than  <dig> of the late responding genes encode membrane-associated proteins . proteins regulating osmotic pressure, water balance, and wall modifications have been implicated in plants’ stress responses and environmental adaptation
 <cit> . these functions are encoded by genes of all four-memory response types, suggesting that after providing an up/down transcriptional response in s <dig>  a large number of arabidopsis genes alter their transcript outputs  in a subsequent exposure to more finely modify cell membrane structure, ion balance and homeostasis.

dehydration stress memory genes in crosstalk with other response pathways
individual genes that are regulated by multiple different stimuli represent overlapping points of these plant’s signaling networks
 <cit> . the subset of the dehydration stress memory genes that are at these convergent points revealed new aspects of plants’ stress responses. for example the dehydration/ja pathways share the largest number of both memory and non-memory genes co-regulated by these pathways, consistent with reported crosstalk between jasmonic acid  and aba regulated signaling networks during dehydration
 <cit> , salt
 <cit> , and cold stresses
 <cit> . more than  <dig> ja-responsive genes are up-regulated in s <dig>  and about  <dig> are down-regulated . in s <dig> stress, however,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes continued to provide similar transcript levels, seven produced higher , and  <dig> lower , transcript levels, but  <dig>  genes did not respond in the subsequent stress. thereby, in addition to a finer tuning, the altered transcript levels from the memory genes suggest an altered crosstalk between these pathways in s <dig> compared to s <dig> 

non-memory  and unidirectional memory  dehydration stress responding genes respond every time the plant experiences dehydration stress. concurrent with amplified responses from the  and  memory genes, however, engagement of the  and  genes lessens in s <dig>  suggesting the nature and the dynamics of the interactions between dehydration and other signaling pathways are different during repeated exposures than the interactions occurring in a single exposure.

lastly, we note that tf encoded by memory genes can be critical for the expression of dependent genes in s <dig>  but that they do not necessarily determine the memory behavior of regulated genes in s <dig>  for example, the  memory of the myc <dig> gene, identified as a master regulator of the crosstalk between the aba, sa, ga, ja, and auxin signaling pathways
 <cit> , correlates with the  memory of a large number of myc2-dependent genes common for these signaling pathways . however, the signature gene, rd <dig>  directly regulated by myc2
 <cit>  is a non-memory gene that is up-regulated in both s <dig> and in s <dig>  despite the fairly low levels of myc <dig> transcripts in s <dig>  evidently, another tf activates rd <dig> in s <dig>  the results suggest that diverse gene-specific mechanisms are involved in regulating the behavior of dehydration stress responding genes and that the memory behavior of individual tfs alone does not necessarily determine or predict the memory or non-memory behavior of their targets.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome-wide response of arabidopsis genes to dehydration stress revealed the existence of four distinct transcriptional memory response patterns. by altering transcript levels, and presumably the levels of encoded proteins, memory genes are likely to alter the cellular responses and the crosstalk between overlapping pathways. adjustments of expression of memory genes, together with the consistent responses from the non-memory genes, allow the plant to optimize its responses and the interactions between various signaling systems. transcriptional memory, like defense gene priming, can provide the benefits of a more robust or modified stress response while reducing the costs of the state of preparedness
 <cit> . the behavior of transcriptional memory genes adds a new dimension to our understanding of plants’ responses to dehydration stress and to current models for interactions between different signaling systems. revealing the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional memory responses may be critical for understanding how plants’ adapt to changing environments and is emerging as a new area in plant abiotic and biotic stress response research.
