BACKGROUND
focal adhesion kinase  is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase highly enriched in focal adhesions  <cit> . fak is activated following integrins engagement or stimulation of a variety of transmembrane receptors  <cit> . fak is closely related  to proline-rich tyrosine kinase  <dig> , also known as cell adhesion kinase Î² , related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase , or calcium dependent protein tyrosine kinase .

fak comprises three well-defined domains: an n-terminal four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin , a central catalytic domain, and a c-terminal focal adhesion targeting  domain, necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of fak to focal adhesions  <cit> . the structure of these  <dig> domains has been experimentally determined  <cit> . in mammals or chick the ferm and kinase domains are joined by a short linker  containing a proline-rich motif , which binds sh <dig> domains of several proteins including src and trio  <cit> , and the autophosphorylated tyr- <dig>  <cit> . the kinase and fat domains are joined by a relatively long, poorly characterized, region of ~ <dig> residues containing two proline-rich motifs , which provide the basis for many sh3-mediated protein-protein interactions of fak  <cit> .

fak is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues and plays a critical role during embryogenesis as indicated by the lethality of its deletion at  <dig>  embryonic days in mice  <cit> . fak regulates major cellular functions including migration, spreading, cell cycle progression and survival in numerous cell types  <cit> . fak is important in brain development  <cit>  and appears to play a critical role in the formation of tumors and in malignancy of cancer cells, controlling their invasive and metastatic capacities . pyk <dig> is functionally distinct as it is involved in signalling pathways initiated by extracellular signals that elevate intracellular calcium concentration and by stressful stimuli .

fak is activated by autophosphorylation of tyr- <dig> which recruits several sh <dig> domain containing proteins including src family kinases . phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues in fak by these kinases increases its activity and promotes the recruitment and phosphorylation of associated proteins . thus, fak acts as an autophosphorylation-regulated scaffolding protein, which triggers the assembly of multimolecular complexes regulating downstream signalling cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase  and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  pathways.

fak has been highly conserved through evolution. fak orthologues regulate cell adhesion and migration in drosophila  <cit>  and sea urchin  <cit>  and play an essential role in the morphogenesis of zebrafish  <cit> . in some species, multiple fak transcripts resulting from alternative splicing and/or promoter usage have been characterized. an alternative internal promoter has been identified in chicken and mouse  <cit> . transcription from this alternative promoter results in the production of a truncated isoform of fak, lacking its n-terminal and catalytic domains, termed frnk   <cit> . frnk acts as a dominant negative, inhibiting numerous effects of fak  <cit> . interestingly an n-terminal-truncated form of pyk <dig>  named prnk , has also been reported  <cit> .

cloning fak transcripts from rat brain revealed the existence of various 5'-leader sequences, and alternative splice variants predicting changes in the amino acid sequence of fak  <cit> . these alternative exons code for small peptides located either just before the fat domain , or on either side of the autophosphorylated tyr- <dig> . fak isoforms including boxes  <dig> and  <dig>  have a much higher autophosphorylation on tyr- <dig> than the "standard" isoform , which does not include them  <cit> . fak+ <dig>  is the predominant isoform in rat and mouse brain  <cit> . in addition, a study in human reported the possible existence of other mrna variants of fak, which could potentially lead to the translation of truncated fak proteins  <cit> . the expression of multiple isoforms of fak provides a potential for multiple regulations and/or functions in specific cell types and/or in pathological conditions including cancer.

the aim of the present study was to take advantage of the available genomic sequence information from multiple species to better define the organization of fak gene. using sequence analysis and rt-pcr we then examined the existence and conservation of various putative variants of fak transcripts. finally, we investigated thoroughly in rodent and human tissues the expression pattern of conserved alternative splicing likely to be biologically significant.

RESULTS
phylogeny of fak family kinases
fak cdna and/or genomic sequences are known in several vertebrate and non-vertebrate species. pyk <dig>  which shares around 45% amino acid identity with fak, has been identified in mammals  <cit> . fak gene is referred to as ptk <dig> or ptk2a, and pyk <dig> gene as ptk2b. ptk2a and ptk2b are both located on chromosome  <dig> in human  and chimpanzee, but these two genes are not syntenic in other mammalian species. a recent phylogenetic study of fak family suggested that its common ancestor with pyk <dig> was very ancient  <cit> . we took advantage of the availability of sequence information in an increasing number of species, to re-investigate the overall phylogenetic relationships between fak family members and pyk <dig>  we aligned fak and pyk <dig> sequences from  <dig> species  and used a computerized method  that eliminates poorly aligned positions and divergent regions that may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions  <cit> . thus, our analysis was performed on blocks of positions distributed across the full length fak and pyk <dig> sequences. the phylogenic tree resulting from a maximum likelihood analysis based on these blocks of sequence is shown in fig.  <dig>  the tree suggests that gene duplication leading to the appearance of fak and pyk <dig> occurred after the urochordate  branch since distinct clusters of fak and pyk <dig> proteins are only observed in vertebrates. furthermore, the vertebrate fak genes are more closely related to the common ancestor than pyk <dig> genes, suggesting that pyk <dig> was subjected to less evolutionary pressure. the global tree topology obtained with the maximum likelihood analysis was reproduced using the distance method analysis  on fak complete amino acid sequence  and on isolated ferm or kinase domains . interestingly, the zebrafish genome includes two distinct and likely functional fak genes  <cit>  presumably resulting from genome duplication  <cit> . similarly two fak genes are predicted in fugu genome . in most analysis fugu fak proteins formed a distinct monophyletic group supporting independent duplication in each fish species . however, maximun likelihood analysis with ferm domain indicated fugu fak <dig> and zebrafish fak1a as monophyletic, suggesting that these proteins are orthologues and that fak gene was duplicated before emergence of these two fish species, in agreement with the usual view of early genome duplication in this clade  <cit> . altogether, these data suggest that vertebrate fak family members evolved from a common ancestral gene, which was duplicated in deuterostomes after the echinoderma embranchment, leading to the evolution of pyk <dig> with distinct properties. thus, fak and pyk <dig> appear to be coded by paralogous genes in vertebrates.

fak is conserved in vertebrate and non-vertebrate species . the most conserved domain is the kinase domain  followed by the ferm domain . the c. elegans orthologue of fak appears to be the most divergent. the human fat domain has only 18% amino acid identity with the c-terminus of the c. elegans sequence. however, hydrophobic cluster analysis  <cit>  revealed that the nematode fak c-terminal region has an organization similar to that of human fat , suggesting that it corresponds to a bona fide fat domain. the sequence of the linker regions between ferm and kinase domains, and between kinase and fat domains  is less conserved. the ferm-kinase linker contains a conserved sequence in fak and pyk <dig>  dyaei, with a tyrosine that has been shown to be autophosphorylated in mammals and drosophila. this sequence is absent, however, from the available genomic sequence of c. elegans fak orthologue , suggesting that fak has a fundamental autophosphorylation-independent biological function. the linker region between kinase and fat domains is the most variable region, and contains insertions in some species, which are longest in echinoderma , cniderias  and arthropods . interestingly the c. elegans predicted sequence does not encompass proline-rich motifs in this region .

organization of murine and human fak genes
we then focused our study on mammalian fak, and to obtain more insights into the organization of its gene we compared in detail its sequence in human and rodents.

fak and frnk promoters
fak promoter has been characterized in human  <cit> , while the internal frnk promoter has been identified in chicken and mouse  <cit> . we identified the orthologous mouse fak and human frnk promoters . pairwise conservation analysis of these sequences showed  <dig> evolutionary conserved regions  in fak promoter region . in frnk promoter, we identified a novel ecr  located upstream from the previously reported ones  <cit> . we searched fak and frnk promoters for conserved transcription factors binding sites, and identified novel putative binding sites , in addition to those previously reported  <cit> .

fak 5'-untranslated region
we next investigated the genomic organization of the 5'-untranslated region. this region is important since in most cases the rate limiting step of translation is initiation, which implicates the 5'-untranslated region   <cit> . fak transcripts cloned from rat brain revealed several 5'-leader sequences containing various combinations of five sequences termed boxes a-e  <cit>  . we aligned the murine and human 5' utr sequences of the fak transcripts reported in either mrna or est databases  and localized them in the murine and human fak gene . all reported transcripts contain box a, which is the untranslated 5' part of the first coding exon. murine transcripts contain various combinations of 5' utr sequences corresponding to six previously annotated exons  . comparison of human sequences revealed the existence of at least eight exons, three of which have been annotated . we numbered the four exons conserved between human and mouse as exons - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . boxes b, c and d, previously characterized in rat, correspond to exons - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> respectively . exon - <dig> is present in the human gene, but has not yet been reported in any transcript in that species . the two other mouse 5'-untranslated exons are not conserved in human and we annotated them as -2am and -2bm. conversely, four human untranslated exons are not conserved in mouse fak gene and we numbered them as exons -2ah, -2bh, -3ah, and -3bh . the homology of exons -2am, -3ah and -3bh with various sine/alu repeated sequences  suggests they are part of mobile elements, an observation which may account for their lack of evolutionary conservation. altogether these results identify five novel putative 5'-untranslated exons  upstream from the canonical initiation codon of the human fak gene. our results suggest a complex regulation of exons inclusion/exclusion at the 5' end of fak mrna, which may be important in their localization, stability and/or expression. all the mouse transcripts detailed in fig. 3a contain the conserved exon - <dig>  it is noteworthy that all the human and mouse transcripts detailed in fig. 3a and 3b are compatible with the existence of a single promoter region  adjacent to exon - <dig> in both species  as proposed by golubovskaya et al  <cit>  for human fak.

fak coding sequence
concerning the coding sequence,  <dig> exons are annotated in human   and rat  fak genes, including those coding for boxes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and pro-trp-arg . in contrast, the exon encoding pwr has not been annotated in the mouse gene , although isoforms containing this peptide have been characterized in mouse  <cit> . we examined the sequence of the mouse fak gene and identified an exon encoding pwr. we therefore propose a consistent annotation of human and mouse fak genes, and number exons encoding boxes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and pwr as exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, in both genes .

conserved alternative splicing of fak coding sequence
several alternative exons coding for short peptides have been reported in rat and mouse fak  <cit> . exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are conserved in mouse, rat and human, and their presence, except for exon  <dig>  has also been reported in transcripts from frog  <cit> . we examined the presence of these exons in the fak genes of homo sapiens, chimpanzee , dog , chicken , frog , fugu , and zebrafish . we identified exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the fak genomic sequences of chimpanzee, dog, chicken, frog, fugu, and zebrafish, with more than 80% identity in their nucleotide sequences . this corresponds to 60â80% amino acids identity for boxes  <dig> and  <dig> and 100% for pwr . interestingly, exon  <dig> was found in only one fak zebrafish gene . exon  <dig>  was found in the genomic sequences from dog and chicken and in only one fak gene from zebrafish  and fugu   . we could not conclude about the presence of exon  <dig> in frog since fak gene sequence is incomplete in this species. none of these alternative exons could be identified in non-vertebrate species, suggesting that alternative exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> appeared in a common ancestor of vertebrates. the high degree of conservation of nucleotide and amino acid sequences supports an important physiological role of fak isoforms containing these alternative spliced exons.

putative additional variant fak transcripts
as mentioned above two products, fak and frnk, are transcribed and translated from fak gene and more variety is generated by alternative splicing of four highly conserved exons. in addition to these well characterized gene products, a number of cdnas and ests have been reported that include additional variations. in particular, several human fak transcripts containing various deletions and/or insertions have been reported in different tissues . some of these transcripts would encode putative proteins with interesting predicted properties. alternatively, these variant transcripts could correspond to regulatory mechanisms at the mrna level including nonsense-mediated decay   <cit> . we first examined which of the reported variant fak ests or mrnas were compatible with the human fak gene sequence. this ruled out reported transcripts containing a 39-bp sequence, with an atg in frame with fak open reading frame  apparently inserted in the middle of exon  <dig>  <cit> . this sequence was found in chromosome  <dig>  and not in fak gene, located on chromosome  <dig>  suggesting that it may have resulted from chromosomal abnormality in the source material.

we then analyzed human adult brain rna by rt-pcr to search for the presence of fak transcripts containing other reported modifications compatible with the genomic sequence . one transcript identified in stomach  included an additional  <dig> nt sequence 5' of the canonical exon  <dig> of fak . this transcript corresponds to the splicing of exon -3bh  with exon  <dig>  although exon -3bh is also found in the chimpanzee fak gene, it has not been reported in any transcript in that species. interestingly, exon -3bh contains an atg in frame with fak open reading frame , which would give rise to a 25-amino acid n-terminal elongation of fak  . however, this atg diverges from the canonical consensus sequence  <cit>  and its use remains to be demonstrated. pcr reactions using a forward primer spanning the boundary between exons -3bh and  <dig> ) and a reverse primer spanning the boundary between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  did not yield bona fide amplification products, suggesting that this exon is not included in adult human brain fak transcripts .

a fak transcript truncated of the first  <dig> exons and containing an additional  <dig> nucleotides sequence 5' of exon  <dig> has been isolated from human hippocampus mrna . this additional sequence was also reported in several macaque transcripts  and we identified it in intron  <dig>  adjacent to exon  <dig> in the human fak gene . this transcript contains a non-canonical atg  in frame with fak orf. rt-pcr with a forward primer located in this sequence  and reverse primers located in exon  <dig>  amplified a fragment of the expected size . its sequencing confirmed the presence of exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and the absence of exon  <dig> . no pcr products were obtained with forward primers located in various exons upstream from exon  <dig> and a reverse primer located in the additional nucleotide sequence . thus, this transcript could correspond to an alternative splice variant, or be generated from an alternative promoter located in intron  <dig>  at any rate, our results demonstrate that this transcript is expressed in adult human brain. if translated, it would encode a fak isoform deleted of the ferm domain, but possibly containing a 20-residue n-terminal extension  .

fak transcripts containing an in-frame insertion of  <dig> nucleotides in the catalytic domain have been reported in human brain  <cit> . as expected we localized this sequence between exons  <dig> and  <dig> in the human fak gene and annotated it as exon 18a . exon 18a is flanked by canonical splice donor and acceptor sites. this exon is conserved in homo sapiens and pan troglodytes genomes, although in both species two nucleotides are missing as compared to the published human cdna sequence, predicting a frame shift and the insertion of a stop codon in exon  <dig> . sequencing of pcr products  obtained from adult human brain cdnas confirmed the existence of exon 18a, the nucleotides deletion and the frame shift .

a 3' truncated fak transcript cloned from human brain and characterized by a 91-nucleotide insertion was also reported  <cit> . we localized this additional sequence, which contains an in-frame stop codon, between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  and we annotated it as exon 23a . the presence of this exon and its sequence were confirmed by pcr  of human brain cdnas . transcripts containing either 18a or 23a would encode c-terminally truncated isoforms of fak ] and , see also table 1). we found exons 18a and 23a in pan troglodytes, but not in mus musculus or rattus norvegicus fak gene. no transcript containing these sequences has yet been reported in chimpanzee. the analysis of repeated sequences in these regions revealed the existence of putative long interspersed elements , an abundant class of retrotransposons very active in the human genome  <cit> . altogether our analyses indicate that these two variant mrnas are present in human tissues and would lead to a truncated protein. however, their lack of conservation suggests that they may not be biologically important and may reflect the unstability of the corresponding dna regions.

a fak transcript  in which intron  <dig> is not spliced at its canonical 5' border, resulting in an additional  <dig> nt and a stop codon, has also been reported in human brain   <cit> . we found this sequence at its expected localization in intron  <dig> of fak . however, the human genome sequence reveals  <dig> nucleotide substitution in the  <dig> bp additional sequence compared to the published sequence resulting in a c-terminal glycine instead of a glutamic acid . using a forward primer located in exon  <dig>  and a reverse primer  overlapping the end of exon  <dig> and the additional  <dig> nt sequence, we obtained a pcr product of the expected size, albeit devoid of exon 18a . this transcript, similarly to those containing exon 18a, would encode a fak isoform deleted of the c-terminal moiety of the protein including most of the kinase domain.

various fak transcripts appear to be lacking specific exons. a transcript missing exon  <dig> has been reported in human placenta  and dog  . our data indicate that if this variant is expressed in humain brain this occurs at a very low level . in contrast, we clearly confirmed by rt-pcr , the expression of another fak variant cloned from brain  in which exon  <dig> is skipped  . no change in orf results from the absence of exon  <dig>  during this study, we also found  <dig> other fak transcripts lacking either exon  <dig> or exon  <dig>  . the skipping of these exons leads to stop codons in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . it is noteworthy that deletion of exon  <dig> was used to generate endothelial cell-specific fak knockout mice  <cit> .

altogether these results demonstrate that multiple fak transcripts are expressed in adult human brain . however, these transcripts appear to be expressed at low levels in homo sapiens and not to be conserved in other species but in some cases pan troglodytes or macaca fascicularis. these observations suggest that these alternative transcripts may be side products and/or play a regulatory role in transcription.

regulatory elements possibly involved in the control of fak alternative splicing
since fak gene products appear to undergo multiple alternative splicing, we searched for genomic elements which might be involved in this process. alternative inclusion/exclusion of exons is known to be regulated by cis-regulatory elements present in the exon and within the flanking introns. using the web-based program acescan <dig>  we searched for sequences referred to as ace-exs which are overrepresented in alternative evolutionary conserved exons  <cit> . we observed a marked enrichment of ace-exs sequences in conserved alternatively spliced exons - <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . other cis-regulatory sequences are exonic and intronic splicing enhancers  or silencers  that control exon skipping by recruiting trans-acting splicing factors  <cit> . we analyzed the human fak gene with the rescue-ese prediction program  <cit>  to determine the frequency of ese per exon and found a high score for exon  <dig> . the same results were obtained by browsing the murine fak gene  in which exon  <dig> inclusion/exclusion is also alternatively regulated. the search for ess with two different programs   <cit>  indicated the presence of a high number of ess in exon  <dig> in human and mouse fak gene . interestingly there was no enrichment of ese or ess in the 5' non coding exons . on the other hand, we found a high occurrence of the hexamer ugcaug, a well-characterized ise in various genes  <cit> , in the intronic regions between the alternatively spliced exons -2ah and - <dig>  and between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  of human fak gene . these results provide a basis for the possible regulation of alternative inclusion/exclusion of exons located in the 5' utr region or in the canonical coding region of human and mouse fak gene.

developmental regulation of alternative splicing of fak exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in mouse brain
our study of fak phylogeny supports the conservation in vertebrates of alternative splicing of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  although this alternative splicing can generate theoretically  <dig> distinct transcripts, it is unclear which of these transcripts are actually expressed since the combination of the various exons has not been studied systematically. to amplify simultaneously all exons combinations, we used rt-pcr with primers flanking this region of alternative splicing . embryonic mouse brain mrna at different developmental stages was first analyzed . we obtained multiple pcr products migrating on agarose gels as expected for fragments containing various combinations of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in the same rna samples the total levels of fak transcripts were estimated by amplification of a constitutive fragment, using primers m-f <dig> and m-r <dig> located in exons  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. although the total levels of fak appeared stable throughout development, dramatic alterations were observed in the ratios of the various isoforms. at e <dig>  the short pcr product, with a size indicating it included only exon  <dig>  was predominant. the amplification product of ~ <dig> bp , increased dramatically at e <dig> and remained the major isoform until adulthood . longer isoforms, presumably including exon  <dig>  were less abundant and detected only in post-natal brain.

the use of flanking primers has the advantage to allow the comparison of the ratios of the various isoforms between different samples. however, it does not identify accurately the exact combination of the various alternatively spliced exons in fak transcripts. to address this question we set up an rt-pcr approach using  <dig> distinct forward primers  spanning each possible exonic boundaries immediately upstream from exon  <dig> and the r <dig> reverse primer described above . pcr reactions with each forward primer amplified specifically isoforms containing one of the possible combinations of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  for each of them, the presence of exon  <dig> generated a distinct longer pcr product . we analysed embryonic mouse brain mrna at different developmental stages using this approach. except for transcripts with alternative exon  <dig> alone , which were not detected at any stage , our results suggest that the expression of fak isoforms containing the various combinations of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> follows three distinct general patterns during mouse brain development : i) transcripts containing no alternative exon  or containing exon  <dig> alone  were detected at e <dig> and decreased during development ; ii) transcripts with alternative exon  <dig> alone , or in combination with  <dig> or  <dig> , were present at e <dig>  peaked at e <dig> and tended to decrease thereafter ; iii) fak isoform combining the three alternative exons, fakex: <dig> , <dig> , was detectable at e <dig> and increased steadily thereafter  while transcripts with associated exons  <dig> and  <dig> alone  followed a similar trend, at very lower levels . it should be noted that fakex: <dig>  and fakex: <dig> , <dig> were much less abundant than the others, requiring  <dig> pcr cycles for a good detection. to compare directly the pattern of inclusion of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> during development, we evaluated the total amount of pcr products containing each of these exons . two patterns were clearly apparent. on the one hand the inclusion of exon  <dig> was very weak at e <dig>  and increased gradually during development. on the other hand inclusion of exon  <dig> and  <dig> increased rapidly between e <dig> and e <dig> and remained stable or decreased slightly afterwards.

since amplification from brain tissue does not allow to distinguish between cell types, we examined the exonic pattern of fak in cultured neurons. only  <dig> fak variants were detected in e <dig> cortical neurons . the most abundant variants were fakex: <dig> , fakex: <dig> , <dig> and fakex: <dig> , <dig>  while the detection of fakex: <dig> , <dig>  required  <dig> pcr cycles and was only detected as traces. these results demonstrate that alternative splicing occurs in neurons and that most variants expressed in these cells contain exon  <dig>  furthermore fakex: <dig> , which is detected in whole brain rna is only expressed as traces in neurons, suggesting that it probably originates mostly from non-neuronal cells in whole tissue.

altogether, these results show that the inclusion of the three alternative exons is already taking place at e <dig>  it increases dramatically between e <dig> and e <dig>  in the case of exons  <dig> and  <dig> coincident with the bulk of neuronal differentiation, whereas the increase is more prolonged in the case of exon  <dig>  this difference suggests that the mechanism regulating the inclusion of these various exons in neurons are independent from each other.

alternative splicing of fak exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in rat tissues
we screened various rat tissues for the expression of fak transcripts containing exons 13â <dig> with the rt-pcr approach described above. using primers flanking the alternative exons , we detected in most tissues a single pcr product with a migration on agarose gels expected for a fragment devoid of alternative exons . an additional longer pcr product was detected in skeletal muscle and testis, and two additional fragments in brain . total fak transcripts were evaluated in each tissue . to determine the exact combination of alternative exons in each tissue we used exons boundaries-specific primers , as described above. transcripts containing no alternative exon  were present in all tested tissues . transcripts with alternative exon  <dig> alone  were detected at low levels in adrenal gland, blood, spleen, and thymus, and at very low levels in heart, liver and lung . transcripts with alternative exon  <dig> alone  were detected at very low levels in testis, heart and adrenal gland . transcripts with exon  <dig> alone  were highly expressed in testis and detected in brain . fakex: <dig> , <dig> was detected in all tested tissues . transcripts with associated exons  <dig> and  <dig>  were detected at very low levels in heart . fakex: <dig> , <dig> was detected in testis, spleen, lung and brain  and fakex: <dig> , <dig>  was detected in all tissues examined . as in mouse brain, the isoforms including exon  <dig> appeared to be less abundant since they required 35â <dig> amplifications cycles. these results combined with those obtained in mouse brain show that exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> can be included in combination or independently of each other. overall three transcripts are more widely and highly expressed than the others: fakex: <dig>  fakex: <dig> , <dig> and fakex: <dig> , <dig> . thus, in non-neuronal tissues fakex: <dig> is the major isoform, except in testis where fakex: <dig>  is predominant, as previously reported using different approaches  <cit> . these results indicate that the inclusion of exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> is tightly regulated in a tissue-dependent fashion.

alternative splicing of fak exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in human brain
although alternatively spliced variants of fak exist in humans , no information is available concerning their expression in brain. to search for fak splice variants containing exons  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> in human brain we used the same rt-pcr approach as described above , with primers matching the human fak nucleotide sequence. using primers  flanking exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we detected multiple fak transcripts in fetal and adult human brain rna . in fetal brain, the predominant pcr product corresponded to the expected size of fakex: <dig> , <dig> while a band of the size of fakex: <dig> was also present . in adult brain fakex: <dig> was the most abundant variant . in both types of samples, longer pcr products presumably including exons  <dig> and  <dig> or  <dig> were barely detectable .

we then performed rt-pcr with primers h-f <dig>  h-f <dig>  h-f <dig>  h-f <dig>  selective of the different combinations of exons  <dig>  and  <dig>  and the reverse primer h-r <dig>  to determine precisely the expression of each fak transcript. in fetal human brain rna the main transcripts amplified were fakex: <dig>  fakex: <dig> , <dig> and fakex: <dig> , <dig>  . fakex: <dig>  and, to a lesser degree, fakex: <dig> , <dig> and fakex: <dig> , <dig> were also detected . interestingly, in adult brain, although the general pattern was the same as in fetal brain, all exons combinations were amplified, including fakex: <dig>  and fakex: <dig>  . these results demonstrate that alternative splicing of fak exons takes place in human brain, as in mouse or rat. in human fetal brain samples, results were very similar to those in fetal mouse brain at e15- <dig>  in contrast, two noticeable differences were observed in human adult brain. first, the levels of expression of fakex: <dig> appeared higher than those of fakex: <dig> , <dig>  this may be due to the fact that fakex: <dig> is expressed in non-neuronal cells, including glial cells, which represented a higher proportion in adult human tissue samples. second, all combinations of exons were detected, even if most of them were found at very low levels. this may indicate a larger variety of splicing mechanisms and/or cell types included in the samples.

discussion
the present study provides a global and updated view of the fak family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. fak and pyk <dig> share a high degree of amino acid sequence identity  and nearly identical intron-exon structure . in contrast to a previous report  <cit> , the phylogenetic analysis presented here suggests that pyk <dig> and fak share a common ancestor posterior to the appearance of the echinoderm branch. this different result is probably due to the inclusion of a larger number of fak sequences in the present study, including cnidarian, arthropod and urochordate sequences. the proposed duplication event leading to the emergence of two fak family members is in agreement with chordate genome evolution in which one or several duplications occurred after the separation of craniates and cephalochordates, before the emergence of teleosts  <cit> . the duplication in the early stage of vertebrate evolution was also proposed for other tyrosine kinases families including platelet-derived growth factor receptor  and src tyrosine kinase families  <cit> . in addition, two fak sequences were found experimentally in danio rerio  <cit>  and predicted in takifugu rubripes  in agreement with the additional genome duplication in teleost ancestors  <cit> . similarly, two pyk <dig> genes are predicted in danio rerio , although only one has yet been annotated in takifugu rubripes . thus, fak and pyk <dig> can be considered as paralogous genes in vertebrates. vertebrate fak sequence is closer than pyk <dig> to fak in urochordate, echinoderma and other non vertebrate species, suggesting that pyk <dig> has undergone a more rapid evolution, presumably linked to its novel functions.

the highest degree of conservation in fak family proteins is found in the ferm, kinase and fat domains, whereas the linker regions are less conserved. interestingly, the autophosphorylated tyrosine and the surrounding conserved motif, in the linker between ferm and kinase domains, is absent from c. elegans genome sequence, suggesting that it is not essential to fak function. the kinase-fat linker region was also poorly conserved with multiple insertions/deletions in various species. not surprisingly it is in these linker regions that conserved alternative splicing events take place in vertebrates, including around the autophosphorylated tyrosine  in fak and upstream from the fat domain  in fak and the short isoform of pyk <dig>  <cit> .

we updated the annotation of murine and human genes to take into account the conserved exons, based on the analysis of transcripts and est databases as well as rt-pcr experiments. murine and human fak genes span  <dig> and  <dig> kb respectively . the murine and human fak genes include at least  <dig> and  <dig> exons, respectively. four 5'-non coding exons  and  <dig> coding exons  are conserved in both species . we also show that the promoter regions of full length fak and frnk, previously identified in human and mouse, respectively  <cit>  are conserved between the two species, allowing to identify novel conserved regions of putative regulatory interest. interestingly, the existence of two alternate gene products, full length pyk <dig> and prnk, has been reported in the case of pyk <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that the two promoters are an ancient and conserved feature of this tyrosine kinase family.

most of the translational control occurs at the level of initiation, implicating the 5'-untranslated  region as a major site of translational regulation  <cit> . fak mrnas cloned from rat brain contained various 5' utr sequences suggesting a tight translational regulation  <cit> . the present work expands these results since we identified  <dig> murine and  <dig> human 5' utr exons. four of these exons  are highly conserved in both species , while the remaining exons are not. cis-regulatory splicing sequences are enriched in exons - <dig>  -2bh and in the intron between exons - <dig> and -2ah . we did not find any correlation between the organization of the 5' utr and the inclusion and exclusion of specific alternatively spliced coding exons in fak transcripts, although a more systematic study would be necessary to draw definite conclusions.

within the coding sequence the present study shows that the previously described exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are highly conserved in vertebrates. a number of fak transcripts containing additional sequences have been reported, especially in human. we examined in detail these variants to determine whether they could encode for novel forms of fak with interesting biological properties. one variant transcript  would encode a fak isoform deleted of the n-terminal of fak but including tyr- <dig> and the kinase domain. we also characterized fak transcripts containing modifications that would result in various c-terminal truncations. the presence of either exon 18a or of an extended exon  <dig> would encode isoforms of fak deleted of their c-terminal moiety and most of the kinase domain. the inclusion of exon 23a would result in fak isoforms containing an intact kinase domain but deleted of the c-terminal proline-rich regions and the fat domain. we also found transcripts lacking exon  <dig>  or exon  <dig> . another fak transcript in which exon  <dig>  is spliced out has been reported. this transcript is particularly interesting since exon  <dig> of fak corresponds to the exon  <dig> of pyk <dig> which is also deleted in an alternative splice variant of pyk <dig>  <cit> . these exons encode residues localized in the c-terminal region, between the proline-rich motifs pr <dig> and pr <dig>  suggesting that their deletion could have similar functional consequences. although we did not detect a significant expression of this fak transcript in human brain, it could be expressed in other tissues similarly to the pyk <dig> alternative splice variant  <cit> .

the presence of several of these variant transcripts in human brain was supported by our rt-pcr experiments, which showed that they are expressed at low levels, similar to fak transcripts containing exon  <dig>  however, exons 18a and 23a are not conserved in mouse, and non-conserved alternative splicing events are less likely to generate functional proteins than those which are conserved  <cit> . thus, it remains to be established if these species-specific transcripts are translated into proteins in human tissues. transcripts containing exon 18a may be degraded since inclusion of this exon results in a change in orf and a stop codon in exon  <dig> following the nonsense-mediated decay  rules  <cit> . nmd is an mrna surveillance pathway responsible for the degradation of abnormal mrnas containing premature translation termination codons  which encode truncated proteins potentially harmful for the cell  <cit> . altogether the lack of evolutionary conservation of these alternative fak transcripts does not support an important biological role. as a matter of fact, several of these non-conserved alternatively spliced fak exons discussed here exhibit a strong homology with repeated elements. the 5'-untranslated exons -2am in mouse and the human -3ah and -3bh are likely to derive from alu elements. the primate specific genomic insertion of exons 18a and 23a could be the consequence of line insertion. the exonization of intronic transposable elements  is a well characterized phenomenon in mouse and human and could explain the diversity and the species specificity of those fak gene exons  <cit> .

since our results highlighted a complex regulation of fak mrna alternative splicing we searched in exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and in their flanking introns for cis-regulatory sequences, conserved in mouse and human, known to influence alternative splice site selection  <cit> . exons  <dig> and  <dig> were recognized as alternative conserved exons according to yeo et al  <cit> . we found an overrepresentation of exon splicing silencers  or enhancers  in exons  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. we also identified, in the intronic region between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  a high frequence of a well characterized intronic splicing enhancer sequence  regulating tissue-specific alternative exons inclusion/exclusion  <cit> . we determined that this hexanucleotide is conserved in human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken fak  suggesting that it could be involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of exon  <dig> and/or  <dig>  functional evidences have shown that ugcaug binds various tissue-specific isoforms of mammalian fox- <dig> splicing factors with a high specificity  <cit> . fox- <dig> family factors can act as splicing enhancers or repressors depending on the tissue, the isoform, as well as the localization of the hexanucleotide binding site  and its distance from the targeted alternative exon. the effect of fox isoforms on the alternative splicing of exons  <dig> and  <dig> remains to be established and predictions are difficult since both exons can be alternatively spliced. however, in muscle cells fox- <dig> was shown to act as a splicing repressor of exons normally skipped in muscle but used in other tissues  <cit>  and this effect required the localization of the hexanucleotide upstream from the targeted exon which would correspond here to exon  <dig>  this type of regulation could be responsible for the absence of exon  <dig> in fak transcripts in some tissues. on the other hand, the ugcaug sequences reported to activate splicing are located downstream from the regulated exon  <cit>  concerning here the exon  <dig> of fak. furthermore, the ugcaug sequence and various fox isoforms have been shown to activate the splicing of neuron-specific alternative exons  <cit>  such as the n <dig> exon of the non-muscle myosin heavy chain ii-b  <cit>  or the n <dig> exon of src  <cit> . thus, the presence of multiple cis-exonic and intronic sequences regulating positively or negatively alternative splicing can be correlated with the complex rt-pcr expression profile of fak isoforms containing various combinations of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that we observed in adult tissues and during development.

the alternative exons encoding boxes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and pwr  are highly conserved in vertebrates supporting an important biological role. here, we demonstrate by rt-pcr that, as expected, alternative splicing of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> takes place in human. the study of the pattern of inclusion of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> suggests that they are independent from each other and subjected to tissue and development-specific regulatory mechanisms. for instance, fakex: <dig>  fakex: <dig> , <dig>  and fakex: <dig> , <dig>   can be detected at various levels in all tissues tested while the expression of other exons combinations is restricted to very few tissues, usually at very low levels  in testis, heart, and adrenal gland, and fakex: <dig> , <dig>  in heart). overall, fakex: <dig>  is the most abundant transcript, except in testis and brain in which fakex: <dig>   and fakex: <dig> , <dig>  respectively, are preponderant.

our results demonstrate that the majority of transcripts expressed during brain development or in adult brain contain exons  <dig> and  <dig> , in agreement with previous results obtained with different approaches  <cit> . during mouse brain development the inclusion of these exons increases dramatically between e <dig> and e <dig>  interestingly, this period  corresponds to the initial stages of cortical development in the brain, including cortico-pial basement membrane formation and neuronal migration, both processes requiring fak  <cit> . the preponderance of fak transcripts containing exons  <dig> and  <dig> in human and rodent brain is particularly interesting since the inclusion of the corresponding peptides in fak isoforms increases significantly the autophosphorylation rate  <cit> . this effect results from the relief of the inhibition by the ferm domain, and from the ability of fak including boxes  <dig> and  <dig>  to undergo intramolecular autophosphorylation  <cit> . these specific properties have important consequences since they suggest that the recruitment of these alternatively spliced fak isoforms may lead to their autophosphorylation without requirement for the clustering of multiple fak molecules in contrast to what occurs in focal adhesion. interestingly, the expression of fak transcripts containing exon  <dig> is not restricted to brain. fakex: <dig>  is the most abundant fak transcript in testis in which the autophosphorylation of fak is essential for specific actin-based adherens junctions assembly and disassembly between sertoli and germ cells  <cit> . fakex: <dig> , <dig> and fakex: <dig> , <dig>  are also expressed, although at a much lower level than in brain, in the other tissues tested. the inclusion of box  <dig>  also increases autophosphorylation and its effect is additive with that of box  <dig>   <cit> . in contrast, the function of box  <dig> in fak is not known. our results showing the strong evolutionary conservation of boxes  <dig> and  <dig> in vertebrates support an important functionnal role, yet to be established.

CONCLUSIONS
the fak gene family includes one orthologue in non-vertebrate metazoans and two paralogue genes in vertebrates, fak and pyk <dig>  in vertebrates fak is subjected to conserved alternative splicing of several non-coding and coding exons which are likely to have an important biological function. in contrast, other variations due to non-conserved alternative splicing may be the consequence of the presence of transposable elements in the genome and have no function or be possibly involved in regulatory mechanisms. fak is known to play an important role in human pathology, especially in cancer invasiveness and metastasis  <cit> . since alterations in splicing mechanisms are frequent in cancer cells  <cit>  it will be important to determine whether such mechanisms could alter fak properties, either by modulating the mrna levels, or by changing the coding sequence of expressed proteins.
