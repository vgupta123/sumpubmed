BACKGROUND
understanding of cell responses to environmental stimuli is one of the central tasks of molecular biology. genome-wide gene expression profiling techniques, such as microarray and deep sequencing, are widely used to identify the responsive genes whose expressions are significantly changed after the stimulus. but identifying the responsive genes by differential expressions does not consider the complex gene-gene interactions or regulation information. increasing evidences suggest that cell responses are usually organized as pathways or responsive gene modules consisting of a group of interacted genes at the molecular level  <cit> . identification of the responsive gene modules rather than independent responsive genes can provide better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. with the increasing content of the gene-gene interaction databases, such as protein-protein interaction  databases and pathway databases, several methods have been developed to identify the responsive gene modules by finding an active sub-network in genome-wide gene networks   <cit> . the previous methods usually formulate the module identification task as an optimization problem: first, a module score evaluating the significance of differential expression  <cit>   of any given gene sub-network is introduced as the objective function; then heuristic searching or exact computational methods  are implemented to find the sub-networks optimizing the objective function. the obtained sub-networks are regarded as the responsive gene modules . related methods have been successfully applied for analyzing many physiological processes, such as type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> , immunology  <cit> , breast cancer metastasis  <cit>  and drug response  <cit> .

here we presented a new formulation of the module identification task: a group of closely connected and co-expressed differentially expressed  genes in genome-wide gene networks are regarded as the signatures of the underlying responsive gene modules at the rna expression level. our method named clustex was designed to find those signatures in the first step. many studies show that the genes which are co-expressed in rna level and/or interacted in protein level tend to involve in the same biological process, and promising new discoveries have been found by using the co-expression  <cit>  and/or interaction information  <cit> . after getting the clustered de genes as the signatures, the "missing parts" of the responsive gene modules are recovered in the second step by adding the intermediate genes, which may not be differentially expressed but are on the paths connecting the de genes in the gene network.

human umbilical vein endothelial cells  are widely used as in vitro models to study the vascular systems in inflammation and angiogenesis. we collected two time-course microarray datasets: one is for tumor necrosis factor alpha  stimulated huvecs, an inflammation model  <cit> , and the other one is for vascular endothelial growth factor a  stimulated huvecs, a canonical angiogenesis model  <cit> . then clustex was applied to identify the responsive gene modules of tnf/vegf stimulated huvecs by integrating the time-course microarray data and the genome-wide hprd ppi data  <cit> . results show that clustex has better performances than several available module identification tools on the reference responsive gene sets. the enriched kegg pathways  <cit> , microrna  target gene sets  <cit>  and go terms  <cit>  identified by gene set analysis also support clustex predictions.

RESULTS
clustex overview: identify the responsive gene modules by network-based differentially expressed  genes clustering and extending
clustex is a two-step method for identifying the responsive gene modules by combining gene expression and interaction information. in the clustering step, average linkage hierarchical clustering was used to cluster and partition the de genes into different gene groups according to their distances in gene networks, based on the assumption that a group of closely-connected and co-expressed de genes are the signatures of the underlying responsive gene modules. in the extending step, the intermediate genes on the k-shortest paths between the de genes were added to form the final responsive gene modules . the details of clustex are presented in methods section.

identification of the responsive gene modules of human umbilical vein endothelial cells  in inflammation
clustex was applied to identified the responsive gene modules of huvecs in inflammation model using the 0~ <dig> h time-course microarray expression profiling data  and the hprd genome-wide ppi data  <cit> , with the following settings: the minimum fold changes of de genes is  <dig>  the shortest path length is shorter than  <dig>  for clustering and the "k" is  <dig> for adding the intermediate genes on the k-shortest paths. the identified biggest responsive gene module has  <dig> genes including  <dig> de genes  and the second has  <dig> genes including  <dig> de genes. the top two modules are very significant according to the edge-based module score measurement defined by  <cit>  .

to validate our predictions, three different tnf reference responsive gene sets were collected from 1) netpath "tnf/nf-kb signaling pathway", 2) pid/biocarta/reactome annotated tnf signaling pathways, and 3) pubmed abstracts. we compared our predictions with several available module identification tools. the original node-based approach using simulated annealing  and the edge-based heuristic searching approach in  <cit>   did not find any significant module larger than  <dig> genes using the parameter settings described in method section. the other compared methods included the node-based approach using greedy search , gxna   <cit> , several methods revised from clustex and the simple de gene approach with minimum fold change  . generally, clustex predictions are better both on sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio  on the reference responsive gene sets, except that foldchange_ <dig>   exhibits much higher sensitivity on the literature reference gene set . as the cutoff of the hierarchical clustering is gradually relaxed , the sensitivity of clustex increases but the s/n decreases. the other two module identification methods also show higher specificities than foldchange_ <dig> , which suggests that the interaction data of the gene network provide additional information of cell responses at the molecular level.

gene set analysis of kegg pathways, go biological processes and microrna  target genes were conducted to find additional supporting evidence. sixteen pathways were enriched in the biggest responsive gene module identified by clustex, including many known pathways affected by tnf, such as apoptosis, notch signaling pathway, jak-stat signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway and cell cycle . years ago, apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells has been reported after tnf stimulus  <cit> . looking at the overlapped genes, it is found that caspase apoptosis cascade  may be activated by tnf. jak-stat signaling pathway and toll-like receptor signaling pathway are two signaling pathways activated by tnf  <cit> . our previous study, which used another two micro-array datasets of tnf-stimulated vascular endothelial cells, also found that apoptosis, toll-like receptor signaling pathway and jak-stat signaling pathway are enriched for the responsive process  <cit> . jactivemodules found eleven enriched pathways, gxna found five pathways and foldchange_ <dig>  found nine pathways. the average rank of the pathway enrichments was higher for clustex  than the other three methods  .

for the enriched mirna target gene sets : comparing with five for jactivemodules, four for gxna and six for foldchange_ <dig> , clustex found eight mirnas, more than the other methods . these results suggest that clustex captures more signaling and regulatory information from the gene expression and interaction data of tnf stimulated huvecs. in the enriched mirnas, mir-221/ <dig> is a well-studied mirna which can significantly reduce tube formation and migration by directly targeting kit   <cit> . in the identified biggest tnf responsive gene module, ets <dig>  irf <dig>  esr <dig> and socs <dig>  which are important genes in inflammation and angiogenesis, are also predicted as the targets of mir-221/ <dig>  mir- <dig> is located in a large mirna cluster mir-17~ <dig>  which has been identified as an oncogene  <cit> . it functions as a pro-angiogenic factor by repressing thbs <dig> . mir- <dig> is also predicted to target esr <dig>  irf <dig>  kit, notch <dig>  pappa and tnfaip <dig> in our study. mir- <dig> has recently been reported to regulate cell differentiation  <cit> . a set of inflammatory and/or angiogenic genes, including adam <dig>  cd <dig>  ets <dig>  foxo <dig>  smad <dig> and tlr <dig>  are predicted as the targets of mir- <dig>  which suggests that mir- <dig> may also play important role in the two processes.

we also analyzed the enriched go terms of the biggest responsive gene module. the enriched terms for tnf are mainly divided into three classes: apoptosis, protein kinase cascade and i-kb kinase/nf-kb cascade. apoptosis and i-kb kinase/nf-kb cascade are two main programs activated by tnf. these two go terms are consistent with the enriched kegg pathways. the detail information of the enriched go terms is documented in additional file  <dig> 

identification of the responsive gene modules of huvecs in angiogenesis
angiogenesis is an essential physiological process in vascular systems. clustex was applied to analyze a time-course microarray dataset of vegf stimulated huvecs , a canonical angiogenesis model  <cit> . the biggest responsive gene module has  <dig> genes, including  <dig> de genes . the z-score of the biggest module is  <dig> . on the literature reference gene set , foldchange_ <dig>  achieves highest sensitivity and clustex show competitive performance with jactivemodules, while on the reference gene set collected from pathway databases , clustex achieves highest specificity and competitive sensitivity to foldchange_ <dig>  .

for the following gene set analysis: thirteen pathways and eight enriched mirna target gene sets were found enriched in the biggest responsive gene module identified by clustex; nine pathways and eight mirnas were found for jactivemodules; one pathway and six mirnas were found for gxna; and three pathways and six mirnas were found for foldchange_ <dig>  . in the enriched pathways, tgf-beta signaling pathway, cell cycle and wnt signaling pathway are frequently reported to be related to vegf stimulus  <cit> . in the enriched mirnas, mir- <dig> is detectable in huvecs  <cit>  and mir- <dig> has been reported to play an important role in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis  <cit> . mir-132/ <dig>  ranked as the first for the vegf dataset, may regulate angiogenesis by targeting ep <dig>  map3k <dig>  mapk <dig> and mapk <dig>  the enriched go biological processes are mainly apoptosis and rna/nucleic acid transport related terms , which is consistent with vegf pro-angiogenesis effect.

discussion
the cross-talk between inflammation and angiogenesis in notch signaling pathway
several studies have shown that endothelial cells are closely related to angiogenesis within an inflammatory environment  <cit> . notch signaling pathway may play essential role in the cross-talk between inflammation and angiogenesis  <cit> . this pathway was found enriched both in tnf and vegf responsive gene modules identified by clustex. several repressing signals of notch signaling pathway were found after tnf stimulus, which can promote angiogenesis sprouting with the following vegf stimulus  <cit> . some transcription factors in the identified responsive gene modules, such as rela , yy <dig> and smad <dig>  which are the direct and highly co-expressed neighbors of the genes in kegg annotated notch signaling pathway, may also participate in the signaling.

limitation of the protein-protein interaction edges
some cell adhesion molecules of huvecs significantly up-regulated in inflammation, such as icam <dig>  vcam <dig> and sele were not covered in the identified responsive gene modules. we manually checked the expression correlations between these genes with their neighbor genes and found that the correlations are relatively low. the promoters of the three genes contain multiple transcription factor binding sites of the nf-kb complex , which are significantly up-regulated by tnf stimulus and covered in the biggest tnf responsive gene module . these observations suggest that the missed responsive genes are more likely to connect with the biggest responsive module by transcriptional regulation rather than protein-protein interaction. so the missing edges representing the transcriptional regulations  should be added in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
taking the closely-connected and co-expressed differentially expressed  genes in condition-specific gene networks as the signatures of the underlying responsive gene modules provides a new strategy to solve the module identification problem. the responsive gene modules can be identified by finding the extended sub-networks from groups of clustered de genes. following this strategy, a two-step method named clustex was proposed and applied to identify the responsive gene modules of huvecs within inflammation and angiogenesis. clustex shows better performances than several available module identification tools on reference responsive gene sets. the following gene set analysis of pathways and mirna target genes also support clustex predictions.
