BACKGROUND
studies on actinorhizal symbioses have benefitted greatly from several genome sequences of the actinobacterial symbiont frankia sp. strains. such strains induce root nodules and fix n <dig> in a broad array of plants  <cit> . the smallest frankial genome finished to date is that of frankia sp. hfpcci <dig>  that infects plants of the family casuarinaceae; it is about  <dig>  mbp in size and encodes  <dig> cds  <cit> . a striking feature of the cci <dig> genome is the presence of over  <dig> transposase genes or gene remnants that may play, or have played, a role in genome plasticity  <cit> . in addition, relative to other frankia sp. genomes that have been sequenced, cci <dig> contains few gene duplicates  <cit> . comparative genome studies suggest that evolution has favored gene deletion rather than duplication in this strain, perhaps as an outcome of its symbiotic focus on a single, geographically limited group of plants in the casuarinaceae  <cit> .

transcriptome sequencing of bacterial genomes has yielded surprising complexity . such studies have shown differential cistron transcription within operons  <cit> , small regulatory rna transcripts  <cit>  and numerous riboswitch controlled transcripts  <cit> . significant transcriptional heterogeneity has also been found in single cultures that has been ascribed to subpopulations within an otherwise synchronized bacterial population  <cit> . high throughput rna-seq methods provide a tool for transcript quantification with a much higher dynamic range than that provided by microarray studies by relying on direct comparison of transcript abundance for assessing differential expression  <cit> .

frankia transcriptome studies have the potential to reveal common genes and pathways active in, or essential to, symbiosis and free-living growth. a first step to resolving symbiotic-specific expression is to gain insight into transcriptional behavior and variability in axenic culture. this work helps address the issue of cultural heterogeneity that will likely be exacerbated by physiological heterogeneity in symbiosis. a previous transcriptome study has been done using whole-genome microarrays in alnus and myrica root nodules using cultured frankia alni strain acn14a as a reference  <cit> . in that study, relatively few surprises were encountered and the overall transcription profile was similar in both nodule types. we focus here on an approach using transcriptome deep sequencing of cultured frankia strain cci <dig> grown under different conditions, and the analysis of subsequent data to provide insight into the global expression that may impinge on physiology and genome stability in frankia strains.

RESULTS
culture characteristics and experimental design
as a consequence of its filamentous growth habit, frankia sp. strain cci <dig> grows from hyphal tips with an initial doubling time of about  <dig> hrs that subsequently slows to more linear growth  <cit> . as tips extend, cells left behind are physiologically in stationary phase and eventually senesce. thus, even young cultures  have a degree of physiological heterogeneity that increases as cultures age  <cit> . this heterogeneity must be taken into account in interpreting global transcriptome analyses.

several factors in our sampling and library creation may influence a transcriptome analysis. single frankia cultures were used in preparing rna libraries for each sample prior to sequencing. in addition, each sample was run on the illumina ga iix sequencer without technical replicates. while technical and biological replicates would have eliminated two potential sources of variability in the results of this experiment, several studies have suggested that both types of variability are unlikely to influence end results  <cit> , while other studies have found significant variation among replicate samples  <cit> . such effects may only influence low rpkm value genes  <cit>  but, as with many such studies, our results must be viewed in the light of many potential variables.

rna sample quality and features
rna preparations used for making dscdna libraries for illumina sequencing had 260/ <dig> ratios greater than  <dig>  and greater than  <dig> to  <dig> ng per μl. pcr amplification using primers for the glna gene failed to yield an amplicon from rna preparations indicating very low, if any, dna contamination. in addition, an rt-pcr assay revealed no detectable dna within total rna samples prepared in a separate experiment, confirming that the rna extraction technique can apply to sensitive rna based experiments that use strain cci <dig> 

transcriptome sequencing done using 5dnh <dig> cci <dig> cells yielded about six million reads, three million of which could be mapped to the frankia sp. cci <dig> genome . almost 51% of the mapped reads were from rrna or trna . an updated base-calling algorithm  yielded substantially higher reads for samples from 3dnh <dig> and 3dn <dig> cultures. about  <dig> million reads were obtained for the latter samples, with about  <dig> million mapped reads in each . non-coding rnas represented a greater proportion of mapped reads in these two samples, comprising nearly 80% of the total.

ǂ includes reads that mapped ambiguously. ambiguous reads were only counted once.

even after ribosomal rna depletion, non-coding sequences formed the majority of reads in all samples with the greatest reduction seen in the 5dnh <dig> sample . this relative amount of rrna could be related to the reduction of rrna in older cultures, as observed in stationary and death phase cultures of e. coli  <cit> . on the other hand, given the concentration dependence of the rrna depletion method used in preparing the mrna-seq libraries, a decrease in the proportion of rrna in the five-day time point could have resulted from more efficient depletion. incomplete depletion of rrna populations is similar to what is observed in other studies and is related to the sheer abundance of such sequences  <cit> .

the number of coding rna reads was similar among all three samples although the read length for the 3dnh <dig> and 3dn <dig> samples was  <dig> versus  <dig> for 5dnh <dig>  all of the pseudogenes present in the cci <dig> genome had transcripts in at least two of the three genomes . pseudogene transcription is presently not believed be a rare event  <cit> , though many pseudogenes identified in a bacterial genome may simply be misannotated orfs.

functional pathways
the  <dig> genes with the highest rpkm value in each condition, omitting ribosomal rnas, are listed in table  <dig>  the number of hypothetical genes in this group range from  <dig> in the 3dnh <dig> cells to  <dig> in the 3dn <dig> cells to  <dig> in the 5dnh <dig> cells. older cultures had more transcripts associated with trnas, transposases, crispr elements, integrases and hypothetical proteins than did younger cultures. indeed, had they been included in the list,  <dig> of the  <dig> trna genes in cci <dig> would have been in the top  <dig> most abundant transcript populations in 5dnh <dig> cells whereas no trnas were found in the top  <dig> transcripts in 3dn <dig> or 3dnh <dig> cell populations. the picture painted by the abundance of such transcripts is one of cells starved for essential metabolites such as amino acids, as expected in aging cells. in addition, enzymes involved in solving oxidative damage  were also more abundant in the older culture. conversely, enzymes involved in catabolism  were more frequently represented in the two younger cultures.

 <dig> gene annotations and locus tag numbers are colored based on their presence in all three samples , in the 3dn <dig> and 5dnh <dig> samples , in the 3dn <dig> and 3dnh <dig> samples , in the 3dnh <dig> and 5dnh <dig> samples , and in one of the three samples .

 <dig> rpkm  = /.

comparison of the top  <dig> gene lists with each other  and construction of heat maps of all genes revealed that overall gene expression varied more with culture age  than culture condition , with 3dnh <dig> and 3dn <dig> clustering before the 5dnh <dig> sample . gene dendrograms  gave five clusters of genes  that had within-group expression profiles consistent among the three culture conditions tested. the genes in each cluster are listed in additional file 1: gene_list.xls.

group i genes are clearly down-regulated in 3dnh <dig> cells; these include  <dig> transporter related genes, five diguanylate cyclases and an array of putative n-controlled proteins such as assimilatory nitrate reductase, adenosine deaminase, allantoinase and nitrogen fixation  genes in addition to  <dig> hypothetical proteins. group ii genes are up regulated in 3dn <dig> cultures and include most of the nif genes, genes involved in sulfur metabolism and iron-sulfur protein synthesis, cell division proteins and hydrogenase synthesis. the 3dn <dig> culture was prepared with a modified iron stock containing a higher concentration of iron sulphate and sodium molybdate  <cit> . we cannot rule out that an increase in iron-sulfur protein synthesis may be related to the increase in iron sulphate to the medium although it is more likely to be related to an increased demand for iron and molybdenum. eight phage integrases were also present in group ii, which was the highest number of integrases present in any of the five groups. group iii contains genes that have relatively more transcripts in 5dnh <dig> cells; these include a larger proportion of hypothetical protein orfs  than were present in the other four groups . all of the annotated excisionase/xis orfs were present in the group iii list, suggesting that phage-related excisionases are being transcribed more in the 5dnh <dig> sample than in the other conditions. group iv genes were more abundantly transcribed in the 3dnh4+ sample including several sigma factors; this group also had the fewest transposase orfs . group v contains orfs more highly expressed in younger cultures. orfs in this grouping include  <dig> ribosomal protein orfs, and a majority of the glycolytic enzymes.

as expected, nif orfs were more highly expressed in the 3dn <dig> sample, with numerous vesicles present, than in the 3dnh <dig> sample and were in group ii on the heat map. the 5dnh <dig> culture also had nif expression above that detected in the 3dnh <dig> culture. three nif orfs were not significantly expressed in the 5dnh <dig> sample over the 3dnh <dig> sample as predicted by a kal's ztest p value  <cit>  . on the other hand, the genes for the core nitrogenase components nitrogenase reductase , and nitrogenase alpha and beta chains  were upregulated in the 3dn <dig> sample, and were cotranscribed to similar extents within individual cultures, suggesting that they exist in an operon independent from the rest of the nif cluster. an intergenic space consisting of  <dig> nucleotides between these three orfs and the rest of the cluster supports this analysis. the presence of nif transcripts in all cell types, even where ammonia should still be in excess, is in concert with the heterogeneous nature of the frankial growth habit, where mycelia develop microsites that are potentially nutrient deficient or microaerobic due to adjoining cell populations. the 5dnh <dig> cells are most likely depleted for combined nitrogen and, indeed, a few vesicles can be observed in older cultures. this observation highlights a fundamental problem with the mrna deep sequencing of a frankia culture where different cell physiologies can skew average gene expression in a culture. apart from isolated vesicles  <cit>  that are unlikely to give a sufficient quantity of mrna for second generation sequencing technologies, long-read, single molecule sequencing techniques run in parallel could specifically sequence the transcriptome of distinct cell morphologies in a pure culture as was recently done with vibrio cholerae  <cit> .

insertion sequences
recent studies on frankia proteomes have indicated the presence of several transposases in cci <dig> grown in culture and in symbiosis  <cit> , raising the question of how is elements behave in cultured cci <dig> cells. given the number of transposase orfs in the cci <dig> genome , mrna deep sequencing provides an efficient method of quantifying their behavior in cultures grown under different conditions.

rpkm values for the transposase orfs were plotted against the locations of is elements in strain cci <dig> . additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> list the calculated expression data for the transposase orfs. transposase transcripts were generally more abundant than the transcriptome's median rpkm value  throughout the genome. the visual representation of transcript abundance in figure  <dig> indicates that transposase orfs were overall more highly expressed in older cultures and, to a lesser extent, in n <dig> fixing cells than in younger, nutrient sufficient cultures. seventy-three transposase orfs in the 5dnh <dig> sample were more highly expressed with respect to the 3dnh <dig> sample . only  <dig> transposase orfs were shown statistically to have higher expression in 3dnh <dig> than in 5dnh <dig>  a similar trend was noticed in the 3dn <dig> vs 3dnh <dig> sample, with  <dig> transposase orfs having statistically significant higher expression values in the 3dn <dig> sample. many transposase orfs had similar expression in the 3dn <dig> vs 3dnh <dig> and the 5dnh <dig> vs 3dnh <dig> comparisons. this is reflected in the ztest p values, as the 3dn <dig> vs 3dnh <dig> comparison had  <dig> changes with p values greater than  <dig>  and the 5dnh <dig> versus 3dnh <dig> comparison had  <dig> changes with p values greater than  <dig> . the majority of the insignificant p values in the comparisons are due to similarity of rpkm values.

one is <dig> transposase  near the  <dig> mb region of the genome had an rpkm greater than  <dig> in all samples. the majority of these reads were ambiguous. this transposase has five paralogs with greater than 99% nucleotide similarity, thereby accounting for ambiguous reads, so the elevated rpkm, while still high, is distributed among several paralogs. other transposase orfs with rpmk values higher than the median were more likely to be present in cci <dig> deletion windows  as determined by a chi square test against the likelihood that high rpkm transposase orfs would exist in a similar sized region of the genome at random . this observation suggests that any transposase found in these windows is more likely to be transcribed at higher levels than transposases outside of these regions.

the largest change in expression was found in an is3/is <dig> orf between the 5dnh <dig> and 3dnh <dig> samples. this orf  was expressed eleven fold higher in the 5dnh <dig> sample than in the 3dnh <dig> sample. five other is <dig> orfs are also highly expressed in 5dnh <dig> ranging from  <dig> fold to  <dig> fold higher expression than in the 3dnh <dig> sample. eight is <dig> transposases had no detected reads under the alignment conditions in each growth condition. these eight is <dig> transposases are members of a previously described group of  <dig> paralogs that have nearly 99% similarity in nucleic acid sequence  <cit> . parameters of the sequence alignment used allowed for ten sites of ambiguity, therefore discarding reads from eight of these  <dig> duplicates as too ambiguous to map on the reference genome. graphic depictions of assembled reads derived from raw clc workbench files show that the majority of reads for the six detected is <dig> transposases mapped around two regions. both of these regions contained one nucleotide difference from the other eight identical transposases. de novo alignment of the unmapped reads from each sample resulted in a full map of the highly duplicated is <dig> transposase orfs .

more globally, the 5dnh <dig> and 3dn <dig> samples had higher rpkm values per transposase orf than in the 3dnh <dig> sample. the sum of the rpkm values among the transposase data set placed the 5dnh <dig> sample  and the 3dn <dig>  each nearly 30% higher than in 3dnh <dig> . the numbers of transposase genes classified as upregulated in the heat maps in figure  <dig> include  <dig> in 3dn <dig> cells,  <dig> in 5dnh <dig> cells and only two in 3dnh <dig> cells. twenty-eight were down regulated in the 3dnh <dig> cells as shown by the heat map analysis . these results suggest a relative quiescence of transposase orfs during healthy growth, and a burst of transcription when cells are stressed. mutagenesis of genes involved in general metabolic pathways in escherichia coli has been shown to promote earlier transposition of an is <dig> family insertion sequence  <cit> . media supplements to the mutated cells were shown to delay transposition events, thereby showing general starvation responses were likely involved in increased is element activity  <cit> .

the expression of nif cluster genes in the 5dnh <dig> sample suggests that the ammonium content of the medium was depleted, or nutrient deprived microsites had developed among the mycelia. one of the highly expressed non-ribosomal orfs is the pyrophosphohydrolase gene hise , suggesting that the amino acid histidine is in short supply. additionally, a serine o-acetyltransferase was highly expressed in 5dnh <dig> cells, indicating activity in the cysteine synthesis pathway. higher expression of both ppx/gppa orfs  in the 5dnh <dig> sample suggests that the stringent response  <cit>  is active in response to amino acid deprivation. two orfs annotated as ppgpp synthetases  were actually more highly expressed in 3dn <dig> and 3dnh <dig> cells than in 5dnh <dig> cells.

transcription of is elements does not directly correlate to translation  <cit> . many is elements prevent their own transposition by requiring a - <dig> frame shift mutation in the transcript in order to express a functional transposase protein  <cit> . since the specific methods of translational control used by frankia is elements are unknown, transcriptome data alone cannot be used as a proportional metric for transposition activity. on the other hand, recent proteomic studies on the cci <dig> genome have confirmed that translation of many is elements does occur in vivo and in symbiosis  <cit> .

rt-qpcr confirmation of transposase transcription
duplicated copies of highly similar transposase orfs presented a problem in the analysis of transcript sequence data. to compare transcription frequencies of duplicated orfs in different culture conditions, we used rt-qpcr to amplify conserved regions of eight duplicated transposase orf families using primers designed to amplify conserved regions in each group. the duplicates had greater than 98% nucleotide similarity with each other. the glutamine synthetase i  gene was used to normalize expression data as previously described  <cit> . we included a five-day old nitrogen fixing  condition in our assay to better estimate transposase orf expression in two older culture conditions .

the results of the rt-qpcr assay confirmed the transcriptome sequence data . comparing the five-day samples with three-day samples revealed an increase in transposase orf transcription in older cultures in nearly all cases . the only exception was in the case of the tn <dig> family of transposases where transcription was predicted to be higher  at three days in both conditions. this may be due to transposition immunity described for other members of the tn <dig> family  <cit> . cross comparisons of nh <dig> and n <dig> samples revealed that nitrogen fixing cultures had more transposase transcripts from these duplicated families than from the ammonium cultures at both time points . the most dramatic change in transcript quantity was found for the is <dig> transposases' transcripts in the 5dn <dig> sample that were  <dig>  fold higher than levels in the 3dnh <dig> sample. as the representative transposase orfs chosen for the rt-qpcr analysis were families of duplicates, a direct comparison of rt-qpcr fold change to transcriptome rpkm values was difficult to make. still, the results of this experiment confirm the general trend of transposase orf transcription in frankia sp. cci3: older and nitrogen-deprived cultures had higher transcription of transposase orfs.

prophage and crisprs
orfs with phage-related annotations were all more highly transcribed in the five-day sample with respect to both three-day samples . several orfs annotated as phage integrases were expressed more than two-fold in the 5dnh <dig> sample when compared to the 3dnh <dig> sample. comparisons of fold change among all three samples yielded many statistically insignificant differences as determined by a kal's z-test suggesting that these orfs are likely transcribed at similar rates regardless of culture conditions. a phage spo <dig> dna polymerase-related protein  was constitutively expressed in all three samples, and four phage resistance orfs were up-regulated in the 5dnh <dig> sample. the latter include members of the pspa and pgl  families of phage resistance genes. similar rpkm values between the two pgl orfs in all three samples suggest that these orfs are transcribed as an operon in cci <dig>

cci <dig> has four putative crispr arrays, two of which are located near clusters of cas orfs . three of the crispr arrays had high numbers of repeat copies  making alignment of ambiguous sequence reads difficult. even the shorter  <dig> bp read lengths of the 5dnh <dig> sample could not be reliably mapped across the arrays using the clc genome workshop alignment programs. as a result, few reads mapped to the array region of the crispr islands and numerous deletions were predicted . the cas orf transcripts, by contrast, were detected in all three samples. again, transcription was modestly higher in the 5dnh <dig> sample than in the 3dnh <dig> sample . in this instance, the 3dn <dig> sample had nearly two fold higher expression of all cas orfs when compared with the 3dnh <dig> sample. comparison of the 5dnh <dig> and 3dn <dig> samples revealed insignificant fold changes as determined by a kal's ztest.

snp detection
given the base pair resolution of rna sequencing, it is possible to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms . recent analysis of the bovine milk transcriptome revealed high fidelity of snp calls derived from an rna-seq experiment, though the authors caution that stringent criteria are necessary to reduce false positive calls  <cit> . using similar filtering criteria, we identified  <dig> snps in the 5dnh <dig> sample,  <dig> snps in the 3dn <dig> sample and  <dig> snps in the 3dnh <dig> sample. comparison of the snp populations revealed that the 5dnh <dig> sample had substantially different snp calls than the 3dn <dig> and 3dnh <dig> samples. only  <dig> of the putative snps were found in all three samples . twelve of these common snps resulted in non-synonymous amino acid changes.

 <dig> the nucleotide present in the reference genome sequence of frankia sp. cci <dig> 

 <dig> the predicted allelic variants for the reference position nucleotide. the most common polymorphic nucleotide is listed first in the proportion.

there are several possibilities that may explain the variance of snp content between the 5dnh <dig> sample and the two three day samples. the age of the culture is a possible, yet unlikely, contributor to a significantly different snp pattern. frankia strains are maintained by bulk transfer of cells since derivation from single colonies is problematical due to the hyphal habit of growth. thus, over time, snps likely arise spontaneously. another possibility is that errors are incorporated into the mrna-seq libraries resulting in false positive snps. the superscript iii© reverse transcriptase used in the first strand cdna synthesis was derived from a mml virus  <cit>  and has an error rate of approximately  <dig>  × 10- <dig> errors per base  <cit> . therefore, only snps detected in all three samples with high coverage and multiple variant copies were likely true positive snps.

CONCLUSIONS
we deep-sequenced dscdna libraries derived from three culture conditions of frankia sp. cci <dig>  overall gene expression varied more as a function of culture age than as a function of nitrogen deprivation, likely because the cell population has fewer actively growing cells at the fifth day of culture and those remaining are adapting to nutrient deprivation. in two limited nutrient environments, transposase orfs were relatively more highly expressed than in younger ammonium grown cells. a rt-qpcr assay designed to quantify highly duplicated transposase orfs supported the data from the mrna-seq experiment. these results, in tandem with discovery of putative snps, suggests that the is element laden cci <dig> genome is in constant flux within the relatively mundane conditions of a culture flask.
