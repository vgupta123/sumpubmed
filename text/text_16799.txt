BACKGROUND
chemokines are specialized cytokines  that induce chemotaxis in proximal cells. the cc subfamily is primarily a chemoattractant to monocytes and lymphocytes  <cit> , demonstrating their role in immune response. chemokines are highly conserved across species, suggesting their roles are essential to viable offspring  <cit> . they have been implicated specifically in brain health, including neuronal migration during development and even neuronal death  <cit> , which has important implication on brain health throughout life and could have important implications in neurodegenerative diseases. ccl <dig> is part of the cc chemokine subfamily and is predominantly expressed in the liver  <cit> . the ccl <dig> protein is also known to be present and active in the brain and blood  <cit> .

ccl <dig> is located on the q arm of chromosome  <dig> amongst a cluster of other chemokines and is known to play a role in angiogenesis  <cit> . while the ccl <dig> protein is known to be heavily active in the liver, little is known about its overall regulation in the brain and blood.

to date, most research regarding ccl <dig> is limited to its expression in the liver and its role in chemotaxis, generally. little is known about ccl <dig> gene regulation and the protein’s role across all tissues. it is clearly involved in immune response, as one of its primary functions is to attract lymphocytes and monocytes  <cit> , making ccl <dig> a potentially critical protein throughout the body. it is also unclear how ccl <dig> protein levels across blood plasma and csf are regulated.

here, we measure ccl <dig> protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid  and blood plasma, and perform a genome-wide association analysis to identify snps that are associated with ccl <dig> levels in both csf and blood plasma. these findings will help clarify ccl <dig> regulatory mechanisms and their effects on human development and health.

methods
subjects and data description
exactly  <dig> and  <dig> csf and blood plasma samples, respectively, were used in this study from participants in the knight-alzheimer’s disease research center at washington university school of medicine  and  <dig> and  <dig> csf and blood plasma samples, respectively, were used from the alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative . from the knight adrc samples, approximately 93 % of the samples were controls, and 7 % were alzheimer’s disease cases, and from the adni samples, approximately 85 % were controls, and 15 % were ad cases. we measured levels for ccl <dig> in each sample using the human discoverymap panel v <dig>  and a luminex  <dig> platform  <cit> . all samples were genotyped using the illumina  <dig> or the omniexpress chip. the knight adrc samples and associated collection methods were previously described  <cit> . we collected the adni samples from the adni database , which were part of the adni biomarker study  <cit> . all samples are of european descent.

snp imputation
the snps were imputed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, data from the  <dig> genomes project  were used to impute snps using beagle. imputed snps with the following criteria were removed:  an r <dig> of  <dig>  or lower,  a minor allele frequency  lower than  <dig>   out of hardy-weinberg equilibrium ,  a call rate lower than 95 %, or  a gprobs score lower than  <dig> . exactly  <dig> , <dig> snps passed the qc process.

data cleaning and analysis
we excluded snps that exceeded thresholds for hardy-weinberg equilibrium  <cit>  , missing genotype rate , and minor allele frequency  for each data set, using plink version  <dig>   <cit> , to perform genotype quality control. we then excluded individuals with a missing genotyping rate greater than 2 % , leaving  <dig> individuals from knight adrc and  <dig> samples from adni after cleaning. remaining knight adrc and adni samples consisted of  <dig> and 61 % males, respectively. the average age for adni samples was 76 years, ranging from  <dig> to 91 years, and the average age for knight adrc samples was  <dig>  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> 

after data cleaning, we tested for an association between each remaining snp and ccl <dig> csf levels within each dataset, adjusting for age, gender, and the first two principal components generated by eigensoft  <cit> . we then performed a meta-analysis across both data sets, accounting for sample size, p-values, and direction of effect using the default metal  <cit>  settings. we retained all snps that had a genome-wide significant meta-analysis p-value less than 5×10− <dig> and that had the same direction of effect in both datasets. we then tested associations between each snp and ccl <dig> plasma levels following the same protocol and kept only those snps that were significantly associated with both csf and plasma ccl <dig> levels.

to assess known functional effects and identify snps that are biologically likely to modify gene expression or function, we searched all significant snps in the nhgri catalog of published genome-wide association studies  <cit>   for known disease associations, collected regulomedb annotations   <cit> , and collected functional annotations from wannovar  <cit> .

we performed a conditional analysis for all included snps that were in or near a given region to test whether there is one or multiple independent effects in the region  <cit> . conditional analysis is a follow-up method used to test if there are secondary association signals within a region by retesting each snp while including the top snp as a covariate. we chose the most significant snp in the region to use as a covariate in the conditional analysis.

RESULTS
we identified  <dig> and  <dig> snps significantly associated with ccl <dig> protein levels in csf and plasma, respectively . of these,  <dig> snps were significantly associated with increased ccl <dig> protein levels in both csf and plasma, based on the meta-analyses, all of which are in or near the ccl <dig> gene . the genomic inflation factor was  <dig>  . none of the  <dig> snps have been reported to show association with disease in the nhgri gwas catalog. two snps are located in the 3’ untranslated region ,  <dig> are intronic,  <dig> is downstream, and  <dig> are intergenic . snps are identified as “downstream” if they are within  <dig> nucleotides of the 3’ end of a gene, according to the national center for biotechnology information’s  snp faq archive  <cit> . minor allele frequencies  for the ten snps ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and regulomedb scores ranged from ‘1f’ to ‘6’, with three snps having no known regulation data, according to regulomedb.table  <dig> significant snps in or near the ccl <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> that met our inclusion criteria with pertinent biological information implicating them in ccl <dig> regulation



all ten snps associated with both csf and plasma ccl <dig> protein levels are in high linkage disequilibrium, suggesting there is likely one association signal in the region . the conditional analysis further supports a single signal as the p-values are no longer genome-wide significant when including the most significant snp, rs <dig>  as a covariate. snp rs <dig> is the snp identified as being “downstream” of ccl <dig>  and has a regulomedb score of ‘3a’.fig.  <dig> snps located in and around ccl <dig> are associated with ccl <dig> protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid . snp rs <dig> is the snp most strongly associated with ccl <dig> protein levels in csf. all significant snps are in high linkage disequilibrium, suggesting there is only one association signal in the region

fig.  <dig> snps located in and around the ccl <dig> gene are associated with ccl <dig> protein levels in blood plasma. as in the csf analysis, rs <dig> is the snp most strongly associated with ccl <dig> protein levels in plasma. all significant snps are in high linkage disequilibrium, suggesting there is only one association signal in the region



snp rs <dig> is an intronic snp with a regulomedb score of ‘1f’ and was previously demonstrated to be within an expression quantitative trait locus  that specifically modifies ccl <dig> gene expression  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> snps do not have known regulatory associations or functions, according to regulomedb, but  <dig> of the  <dig> are located in genic regions, such as utrs and introns.

discussion
we identified exactly  <dig> snps associated with increased ccl <dig> protein levels in both csf and blood plasma, all of which were located in or around the ccl <dig> gene and based on the conditional analysis, all representing on single signal. the snp most strongly associated with ccl <dig> protein levels was rs <dig>  which was identified as being “downstream”  of ccl <dig> with a regulomedb score of “3a”. regulomedb scores range from “1a” to “6” where lower scores indicate stronger evidence that the snp affects gene regulation based on both empirical data, such as chip-seq, and whether the snp is within a known transcription factor binding motif. a score of “3a” indicates minimal evidence that a snp is involved in gene regulations, but regulomedb can only represent what is currently known based on experimental data. thus, further investigation of this snp may be warranted. snp rs <dig> received a score of “1f”, indicating that it is known to be part of an eqtl. as such, the rest of the snps are likely part of the same eqtl since they are all in strong linkage disequilibrium.

two of the remaining snps  are located in the 3’utr of ccl <dig>  which can play an important role in gene transcription and translation , while three others  are located within ccl <dig> introns, which can also affect gene regulation  <cit> . the remaining three snps  are located between approximately  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the gene. intergenic variants are generally less likely to affect transcription than variants within the promoter region or the gene itself, though it is possible if the variant affects transcription factor binding. many genes have enhancers both upstream and downstream that can be active in specific tissues, depending on the transcription factors expressed in the tissue  <cit> . however, given that rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> are in high linkage disequilibrium with the other significant snps, we believe they are less likely to be causal variants. the remaining three are intergenic. identifying which snp directly affect ccl <dig> regulation will require experimental data, but we believe the most suspect from these  <dig> is rs <dig> because it has the strongest association, its proximity to the gene, and the fact that many genes have regulatory elements  downstream  <cit> , though the vista enhancer database does not have data on ccl <dig> enhancers  <cit> .

while these  <dig> snps are the most significant and biologically likely to affect ccl <dig> regulation based on our criteria, there may be other snps in the individual csf and plasma lists that regulate ccl <dig> independently, including those found in other genes. more biological data will be necessary to identify causal snps. additionally, our data are not whole exome or genome and there may be causal variants in ld with our top hits, associated with the single signal we’ve seen in our results that were not yet genotyped. full sequencing data within the region may reveal other candidate causal variations.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that one or more snps in or around the ccl <dig> gene are associated with increased ccl <dig> protein levels in both csf and plasma, but it is not clear whether that is due to regulation in multiple tissues such as the brain and liver, or whether the protein is crossing the blood–brain barrier. our results are an important step to resolving this relationship, as they will allow researcher to explore experimentally how these snps affect ccl <dig> gene regulation in different tissues. understanding ccl <dig> gene regulation in greater depth will be important to better understanding its role in human health.
