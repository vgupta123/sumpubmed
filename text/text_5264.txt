BACKGROUND
the majority of statistical methods used for analyzing protein sequences require an amino acid substitution model to describe the evolutionary process of protein sequences. amino acid substitution models are frequently used to infer protein phylogenetic trees under maximum likelihood or bayesian frameworks . they are also used to estimate pairwise distances between protein sequences that subsequently serve as inputs for distance-based phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . moreover, these models can be used for aligning protein sequences  <cit> . these and other applications of the amino acid substitution model are reviewed in  <cit> .

many methods have been proposed to estimate general amino acid substitution models from large and diverse databases . these methods belong to either counting or maximum likelihood approaches. the first counting method was proposed by dayhoff et al.  <cit>  to estimate the pam model. as more protein sequences accumulated, jones et al.  <cit>  used the same counting method to estimate the jtt model from a larger protein data set. however, the counting methods are limited to only closely related protein sequences.

the maximum likelihood method was proposed by adachi and hasegawa  <cit>  to estimate the mtrev model from  <dig> complete vertebrate mtdna-encoded protein sequences. the mtrev model outperformed other models when analyzing the phylogenetic relationships among species based on their mtdna-encoded protein sequences. whelan and goldman  <cit>  proposed a maximum likelihood method to estimate the wag model from  <dig> globular protein families. the wag model produced better likelihood trees than the dayhoff and jtt models for a large number of globular protein families.

recently, le and gascuel  <cit>  improved the maximum likelihood method by incorporating the variability of evolutionary rates across sites into the estimation process. the method was used to estimate the so-called lg model from the pfam database. experiments showed that the lg model gave better results than other models both in terms of likelihood values and tree topologies.

although a number of general models have been estimated from large and diverse databases comprising multiple genes and a wide range of species, they might be inappropriate for a particular set of species due to differences in the evolutionary processes of these species. a number of specific amino acid substitution models for important species have been introduced  <cit> , e.g. hiv-specific models that showed a consistently superior fit compared with the best general models when analyzing hiv proteins.

in recent years, the world has encountered a series of emerging influenza epidemics, including h5n <dig>  or h1n <dig>  these have caused serious problems in economics and human health. theoretical and experimental studies have been extensively conducted to understand the evolution, transmission and infection processes of influenza viruses  <cit> . we propose here our flu model which was specifically estimated for modeling the evolution of influenza viruses. experiment results show that flu is robust and better than other models in analyzing influenza proteins. thus, it could enhance studies of the evolution of influenza viruses.

RESULTS
we used the maximum likelihood approach introduced by le and gascuel  <cit>  to estimate an influenza-specific amino acid substitution model  from data set d comprising  <dig> influenza protein alignments. in the following sections, the main properties and performance of flu in comparison with  <dig> widely used models will be analyzed.

model analysis
flu, as an amino acid substitution model, includes a symmetric amino acid exchangeability matrix and an amino acid frequency vector. thus, we analyze flu with other models by comparing their amino acid exchangeabilities and frequencies. table  <dig> presents low correlations between flu and other models, which means that flu is highly different from existing models. hivb and hivw are among the models that are most highly correlated with flu, since they were also estimated from rna virus proteins.

in the following, we compare flu with hivb  and lg  in detail. figure  <dig> displays the amino acid frequencies of these models and the empirical amino acid frequencies  that were counted from all alignments of data set d. amino acid frequencies of flu and influenza are nearly identical , the correlation being much higher than that of influenza with the  <dig> other models, hivb  and lg . notably, we observe large differences between the amino acid frequencies of influenza and the others. for example, the frequency of leucine  in influenza  is much lower than that in hivb  and lg . these results indicate that flu represents the amino acid frequencies of influenza proteins more accurately than other models.

the exchangeability coefficients of flu, hivb, and lg models , in principle, describe similar biological, chemical and physical properties of the amino acids, e.g. the high exchange rate between lysine  and arginine  or the low exchange rate between lysine and cysteine . however, they differ considerably when we look in their relative differences . for example,  <dig> out of  <dig> coefficients in flu are at least  <dig> times as large as corresponding ones in the hivb model. table  <dig> summarizes the relative differences between flu and hivb, lg models.

the value at the row 'twice' and column 'flu>hivb' indicates the number of exchangeability coefficients in flu that are at least twice as large as corresponding ones in the hivb model. similar explanations can be given for other entries.

in a nutshell, flu is very different from existing models in both amino acid exchangeabilities and frequencies.

flu performance
we compared the performance of flu and other models in constructing maximum likelihood trees for influenza protein alignments. maximum likelihood trees were constructed by phyml with  <dig> discrete gamma rate categories , invariant sites , and -f/+f options  <cit> .

global test
in the global test, we used flu and other models to construct maximum likelihood trees for  <dig> protein alignments of d. since we estimated and tested flu on the same data set d, it contains more free parameters than other models, i.e.  <dig> with -f option or  <dig> with +f option. to compare the performance of flu and other models, the aic criterion was used  <cit> .

the average aic of flu is higher than that of other models . for example, flu gains  <dig>  aic per site when compared with the second best model, hivb. in the case where  <dig> models have the same number of free parameters,  <dig>  aic per site is equivalent to ~ <dig> log likelihood points per alignment of  <dig> sites. the last column of table  <dig> shows the aic differences between +f and -f options. the +f option would improve the aic only when the amino acid frequencies of the model are significantly different from the empirical frequencies. however, the +f option might lead to the loss of aic due to the penalty of  <dig> additional free parameters. table  <dig> shows that the +f option did not improve the aic for most of the models due to the slight difference between the influenza and the amino acid frequencies of the models, except mtrev, mtmam, and mtart estimated from mitochondrial proteins. in these cases, the +f option significantly improved the aic because of the high difference between the amino acid frequencies of influenza and mitochondrial proteins .

two-fold cross validation
in the two-fold cross validation, we randomly divided d into halves d <dig> and d <dig> where either one served as the learning data set and the other acted as the testing data set. due to the low number of protein types , d <dig> and d <dig> might contain alignments of the same protein types. we first estimated flu <dig>  model from d <dig> , and then used flu <dig>  to construct maximum likelihood trees for alignments of d <dig> . consequently, we obtained  <dig> maximum likelihood trees inferred using either flu <dig> or flu <dig>  for the sake of simplicity, we denote flu as the overall model for flu <dig> and flu <dig> in analyzing the two-fold cross validation. since learning and testing data sets are independent, there is no penalty for additional free parameters when comparing flu with other models, i.e., we could directly compare log likelihoods of trees inferred using flu and other models.

the last column shows proportions of proteins used to estimate the flu model.

it is clear from tables  <dig> and  <dig> that flu outperforms all other models. it helps to construct the best likelihood trees for  <dig> out of  <dig> alignments  and the second best trees for  <dig> other alignments . flu trees also have the highest average likelihoods, which is  <dig>  log likelihood point per site higher than the second best model, hivb . this means that flu gains about ~ <dig> log likelihood points on average when applied to an alignment of  <dig> amino acids. hiv models, as expected, are the second and third best models since they were also estimated from rna virus proteins. since ha and na proteins are the most crucial proteins of influenza viruses, a large number of ha and na protein sequences were available to estimate the model . flu outperforms other models in ~98% of ha and na alignments. it is significantly better than hivb in ~95%  of ha  alignments. however, it is worse than hivb when analyzing m <dig> and pb1-f <dig> protein alignments.

 the number on the cell of model m and column p indicates the number of alignments where m model stands at the rank p over  <dig> models tested. for example, flu model stands at the first rank for  <dig> out of  <dig> alignments.

 the number on the cell of model m and column p indicates the number of alignments where m model stands at the rank p over  <dig> models tested. for example, flu model stands at the first rank for  <dig> out of  <dig> alignments.

flu trees have the highest average likelihoods.

the likelihood difference between  <dig> trees inferred using  <dig> different models m <dig> and m <dig> might fluctuate due to various error factors, e.g., numerical problems and local optimizations. to assess the statistical significance of the difference between m <dig> and m <dig>  we used a simple nonparametric version of the kishino-hasegawa  test  <cit>  as used in  <cit> . as explained in  <cit> , the test avoids any normality assumption and selection bias that would favor one model compared with the other . table  <dig> shows that flu is significantly better than other models for the majority of alignments. for example, the kh test determined  <dig>  alignments where flu trees had significantly higher likelihood values than hivb trees. the number increases to  <dig>  or  <dig>  when compared with the jtt and lg, respectively. flu was significantly worse than one of  <dig> compared models in only ~7% of alignments. these comparisons lead to the conclusion that flu describes the evolution of influenza viruses better than other models, thus resulting in more accurate phylogenetic trees.

loglk/site: the log likelihood difference between trees inferred using m <dig> and m2; a positive  value means m <dig> is better  than m <dig>  #m <dig> > m2: the number of alignments among  <dig> alignments where m <dig> results in better likelihood value than m <dig>  #m <dig> > m <dig> : the number of alignments where the kishino-hasegawa test indicates that m <dig> is significantly better than m <dig>  #m <dig> > m <dig> : the same as #m <dig> > m <dig>  but now m <dig> is significantly better than m <dig> 

tree analysis
we observed a large number of alignments where tree topologies of flu and other models were different . for example, flu trees and hivb trees are topologically different for  <dig>  alignments, of which flu is better than the hivb for  <dig>  alignments.

t <dig>  is the tree inferred using m <dig>  model. #t <dig> > t2: the number of alignments where topologies of t <dig> and t <dig> are different and the likelihood of t <dig> is higher than the likelihood of t <dig> , and the number of alignments where topologies of t <dig> and t <dig> are different . #t <dig> > t <dig> : special cases of #t <dig> >t <dig>  where t <dig> is significantly better than t <dig>  #t <dig> > t <dig> : the same as #t <dig> > t <dig> , but now t <dig> is significantly better than t <dig> 

to measure the difference between  <dig> tree topologies, we used the robinson-fould  distance, which is the number of bi-partitions present in one of the two trees but not the other, divided by the number of possible bi-partitions. thus, the smaller the rf distance between  <dig> trees, the closer their topologies. note that the rf ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

robustness of model
we investigated the robustness of flu by measuring the correlations between flu, flu <dig> and flu <dig>  table  <dig> shows extremely high correlations  between flu, flu <dig> and flu <dig> in both amino acid frequencies and exchangeability coefficients. thus, the data set d is sufficiently large to estimate a robust amino acid substitution model for influenza proteins.

 the exchangeability  column gives the correlations between exchangeability matrices  of these models.

we also examined the influence of the temporal aspect of influenza evolution on flu. to this end, the data set d was divided into  <dig> nearly equal subsets dt <dig>  and dt <dig> . we used subset dt <dig>  to estimate model flut <dig> . flut <dig> and flut <dig> were nearly identical . moreover, flut <dig> and flut <dig> were highly correlated to flu . the high correlations indicate that the influence of the temporal aspect of influenza evolution on estimating the amino acid substitution model is insignificant. thus, flu is applicable to analyze both old and recent influenza proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose the flu model that has been specifically estimated for modeling the evolution of influenza viruses. analyses revealed significant differences between flu and existing models in both amino acid frequencies and exchangeability coefficients. experiments showed that flu better characterizes the evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses than general models.

both the global test and 2-fold cross validation confirmed that flu is better than existing models in constructing maximum likelihood trees. using the kh test, flu proved significantly better than other models for a majority of alignments tested. nevertheless, there were a few alignments  where flu was significantly worse than the hiv-specific models or general models, e.g. lg, or jtt. in this study, amino acid sequences were aligned by muscle  <cit>  to produce alignments that serve as inputs for estimating flu. recently, liu et al.  <cit>  proposed a method for coestimating sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, and showed that it improved tree and alignment accuracy compared with 2-phase methods for large dna data sets. although previous studies showed that models estimated using near-optimal phylogenetic trees are relatively stable , it would be interesting to assess the influence of the coestimation method on the estimation of amino acid substitution models in future work. the occurrence of homologous recombination within influenza virus genes has been reported, however, it is rare and controversial  <cit> . therefore, the flu was estimated in a standard phylogenetic framework. the effect of the homologous recombination, if it occurs at all, on the flu model would be discovered in future work. in summary, flu model is useful for any influenza protein analysis system that demands an accurate description of amino acid substitutions. it should enhance our understanding of the evolution, transmission and infection processes of influenza viruses.
