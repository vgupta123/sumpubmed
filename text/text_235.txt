BACKGROUND
cyclic amp dependent protein kinase  is a holoenzyme that consists of a regulatory  subunit dimer and two catalytic  subunits  <cit> . the enzyme is activated when two camp molecules bind each r subunit, causing a conformational change that releases the c subunits  <cit> . different isoforms of both r and c subunits exist. four separate r subunit genes designated riα, riβ, riiα and riiβ have been identified and characterized in all primates investigated  <cit> . in most species investigated three genes encoding the c isoforms have been identified and designated cα, cβ and prkx. prkx is an x chromosome encoded protein kinase  <cit>  that has, despite low homology to cα and cβ, been identified as a pka c subunit with the ability to release the r subunit in a camp-dependent fashion  <cit> . a murine homologue of prkx termed pkare has also been described  <cit> . moreover, in human, an intron-less gene transcribing the mrna for cγ has been identified. cγ represents a testis-specific retroposon  <cit> . in the mouse a c subunit pseudogene has been identified and designated cx  <cit> .

several splice variants of cα and cβ, arising from alternative splicing of the first exon in the cα and cβ genes, are responsible for further diversity. the cα gene encodes two splice variants  in mouse  <cit> , human  <cit>  and sheep  <cit> ). in human  <dig> different splice variants encoded by the cβ gene have been identified and called cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ4ab, cβ4abc, cβ3ab, cβ3abc, cβ3b and cβ4b  <cit> . in the mouse and bovine three and two cβ splice variants have been identified, respectively. in bovine they are designated cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>  <cit>  and in mouse they are designated cβ <dig>  cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>  <cit> . cα <dig> and cβ <dig> are ubiquitously expressed, while the other splice variants show a more tissue restricted expression pattern. cαs/cα <dig> is solely expressed in sperm cells  <cit> . whereas expression of the human cβ <dig> splice variant is enriched in lymphoid tissues  <cit> , it shows a more widespread pattern of expression in the bovine  <cit>  and is restricted to the brain in mice  <cit> . the majority of the other cβ splice variants identified, which include human and murine cβ <dig> and human cβ <dig> as well as the human cβ <dig> and cβ <dig> abc variants, are only detected in nerve cells and the brain  <cit> .

a number of reports have demonstrated that both the cα <dig> and cβ <dig> isoforms have a relative molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda when analysed by sds-page  <cit> . in contrast, human and bovine cβ <dig> have a relative molecular mass of  <dig> kda  <cit>  whereas in the mouse it is  <dig> kda  <cit> . both human and murine cβ <dig> are  <dig> kda, as is also the case with human cβ <dig>  <cit> . for the human cβ <dig> and cβ <dig> abc variants, the relative molecular masses have not been determined.

we investigated the expression of c subunits in various murine tissues and identified two immunoreactive proteins of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> kda. whereas the  <dig> kda band was ubiquitously expressed, the  <dig> kda band was restricted to lymphoid tissues such as thymus, spleen and lymph node. based on this we examined the activity, level and apparent molecular sizes of cβ splice variants in immune cells. using spleen cells from wild type and mice mutant for the cβ gene we demonstrated that the  <dig> kda band was cβ <dig> whereas the  <dig> kda protein was the murine homologue of human and bovine cβ <dig>  the novel murine cβ <dig> was shown to be an active protein kinase that was immunodetected by an antiserum made against the human cβ <dig> specific sequence. based on this, together with sequence homology searches and sequence comparisons, we conclude that the previously reported murine cβ <dig> is a homologue of human cβ <dig>  thus, the murine cβ gene encodes the splice variants cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>  as is the case with the human cβ gene.

RESULTS
murine spleen cells express cα <dig>  cβ <dig> and a novel  <dig> kda cβ splice variant enriched in lymphoid tissues
when lysates made from various murine tissues were separated by sds-page and immunostained with a commercially available pan c antibody , a  <dig> kda band was detected in all tissues. in addition to this ubiquitously expressed band a weaker band of  <dig> kda was detected, that seemed to be restricted to lymphoid tissues, as it could only be detected in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus. no expression was detected in brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle.

to investigate identity of these c immunoreactive bands, spleen cell lysates from wild type  mice and mice that were heterozygous  or homozygous  for a null mutation in the cβ gene  <cit>  and a human t cell lysate were immunoblotted with the pan c antibody . in the human t cell lysate two immunoreactive bands of  <dig> and  <dig> kda were identified. these protein bands have previously been shown to be cα <dig>  and cβ <dig>   <cit> . the  <dig> kda immunoreactive protein band was detected in the spleen cell lysate from wt and cβ+/- mice, but was absent in the cβ-/- lysate, implying that it represents a cβ splice variant. furthermore, in the cβ-/- lysate, the  <dig> kda protein band appeared weaker in intensity. this was confirmed by densitometric scanning of the  <dig> kda bands in figure 1b  which revealed a  <dig> % reduction in intensity of the  <dig> kda band in the cβ-/- lysate. together this implies that cβ <dig>  may be expressed in mouse spleen cells.

spleen cell lysates from wt and cβ mutant mice were also tested for pka-specific phosphotransferase activity by incorporation of 32p from -atp into the pka-specific substrate kemptide . phosphotransferase activity was also measured in the presence of pki to demonstrate that kinase activity was pka-specific . pka-specific activity was reduced by  <dig> and  <dig> % in cβ+/- and cβ-/- mice, respectively, compared to wt  mice. this indicates that cβ contributes significantly to pka activity in mouse spleen cells.

to further investigate the identity of the  <dig> and  <dig> kda protein bands, we analysed c subunit expression and pka kinase activity in mice lacking the cβ <dig> splice variant   <cit> . figure 1d demonstrates that the  <dig> kda c subunit immunoreactive band is present in cell lysates from both wt and cβ1-/- mice. it should however be noted that the  <dig> kda protein band was clearly weaker in intensity in lysate from cβ1-/- mice. densitometric scanning indicated that this reduction was of similar magnitude  as that monitored in the cβ-/- mice. together with the fact that we also measured a  <dig> % reduction in pka kinase activity in the cβ1-/- mice lysates  this demonstrated that cβ <dig> is expressed in mouse spleen cells. finally, the fact that reduction in pka kinase activity in the cβ-/- was approximately twice as much at that observed in the cβ1-/-  strongly implies that the lymphoid tissue specific  <dig> kda protein is a cβ splice variant and that it contributes significantly to pka kinase activity in mouse spleen cells.

cloning and expression of a novel catalytically active murine cβ splice variant homologous to human cβ2
our observations that murine spleen cells express a  <dig> kda anti-c immunoreactive protein that is absent in the cβ-/- animals, and co-migrates with human cβ <dig>  suggest that the mouse expresses a cβ <dig> subunit homologous to the human cβ <dig> subunit. in order to investigate this, we initially performed a homology search in the national center for biotechnology information  blast  search tool using the human cβ <dig> specific peptide sequence. we identified a region with high sequence similarity to the human exon 1– <dig> sequence in the published mouse genome  <cit> . this sequence was located in the mouse cβ gene upstream of exon  <dig> . based on this information and the fact that all c subunits identified so far only differ in the domain encoded by alternative use of exon  <dig>  we postulated a hypothetical cdna sequence using this mouse exon 1– <dig> sequence and the known murine cβ cdna sequence  <cit>  . to confirm mrna expression of this sequence, oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5'-untranslated and 3'-untranslated regions of the cdna were synthesised and used for reverse transcriptase pcr of total rna from mouse thymus since cβ <dig> expression has earlier been reported to be enriched in human thymus  <cit> . pcr products were subcloned into pcr-blunt-ii-topo vector. nucleotide sequencing  and amino acid sequence deduction , followed by comparison of the unique n-terminal end  <cit>  with corresponding sequences in human, bovine, mouse and zebra fish , confirmed the novel sequence as the murine cβ <dig> homologue.

it has previously been demonstrated that a cdna encoding the bovine cβ <dig> was not active when transfected into cho cells  <cit> . to determine if the mouse cβ <dig> cdna encodes an active protein kinase, the cdna was amplified by pcr and subcloned into pcdna-dest <dig> . to optimize for efficient protein expression, a kozak sequence was introduced in the 5'-end. moreover, two different 3'-ends were made, one including and one excluding a stop codon to facilitate native and tagged expression, respectively . the new plasmid was designated pcdna-dest40mcβ <dig> and transfected into hek 293t cells. as a positive control pef-dest51cα <dig>  which expresses human cα <dig> , was used. mock transfected cells served as a negative control. twenty-four hours after transfection cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting using a pan c antibody. this revealed expression of an immunoreactive protein of  <dig> kda in cells transfected with mcβ <dig>  and a  <dig> kda protein in cells transfected with hcα <dig>  a weak  <dig> kda band could also be seen in mcβ <dig> and mock transfected cell lysates , representing endogenous cα <dig>  in order to test for enzyme activity of the expressed cβ <dig>  the same cell lysates were analysed for pka-specific phosphotransferase activity against kemptide. this demonstrated a more than 10-fold increased enzyme activity in the cells transfected with mcβ <dig> and hcα <dig> compared to the mock-transfected cells . the pka specific inhibitor pki abolished this activity, implying that the activity observed is pka-specific and that mouse cβ <dig> is an active pka enzyme. it should be noted that the c-terminally tagged cβ <dig> was kinase inactive and was not used for further experiments .

in order to further demonstrate that the cloned sequence expressed a murine cβ <dig>  specific sequence, we developed an antiserum by immunizing two rabbits with two mcβ <dig> specific peptides . immunoreactivity of the resulting antiserum  was tested by immunoblotting using lysates from hek 293t cells transfected with either mcβ <dig> or human cα <dig>  . this revealed that the size of the protein recognized by the anti-mcβ <dig> serum was determined to be  <dig> kda by comparison with an identical blot probed with the pan c antibody. it should be noted that the anti-mcβ <dig> serum did not appear to cross-react with expressed hcα <dig> 

discussion
the present report demonstrates a lymphoid tissue specific  <dig> kda cβ subunit which together with cβ <dig>  is responsible for  <dig> % of pka specific enzyme activity in spleen cells. the  <dig> kda cβ subunit was cloned and shown to be an active murine pka cβ splice variant. based on a sequence homology search, and production of a specific antiserum, we conclude that the  <dig> kda protein is the murine homologue of human and bovine cβ <dig>  furthermore, sequence comparison also led us to conclude that the previously published murine cβ <dig> is the murine homologue of human cβ <dig>  taken together with previous reports our results demonstrate that the murine cβ gene encodes cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ <dig> and cβ <dig> 

expression of cβ <dig> in murine spleen was indirectly demonstrated by reduced immunoreactivity of the  <dig> kda band and a  <dig> % reduction in pka-specific kinase activity in the cβ1-/- mouse. cβ <dig> expression in murine lymphocytes is in conflict with our previous observations in human t lymphocytes  <cit> , which apparently do not express this splice variant. if this is also the case for murine t cells, it implies that other cell types may account for the presence of cβ <dig> in our cell extracts, since spleen cells are a mixture of various immune cells, including b and t cells as well as macrophages and monocytes.

our results demonstrate the existence of a sequence in the murine genome homologous to the human and bovine cβ2-specific sequence. in addition, we observed a  <dig> kda anti-c immunoreactive protein that was absent in cβ-/- but not in cβ1-/- mice. because the cloned and expressed cβ variant was  <dig> kda as demonstrated by immunoreactivity to a pan c antibody and a serum made against the n-terminus of the novel protein, and because the only known  <dig> kda pka c subunit is the human and bovine cβ <dig>  <cit> , we conclude that the novel c subunit is the murine cβ <dig> homologue. the existence of the  <dig> kda cβ <dig> homologue is in conflict with our previous report, which showed the presence of cβ <dig> in several mammalian species, including monkey, dog, man and bovine, but failed to demonstrate the splice variant in rodents  <cit> . this was concluded based on a zoo-blot  analysis using a probe spanning the human cβ2-specific sequence. failure to identify a murine cβ <dig> may have been due to low homology between cβ <dig> of various species, which we also discovered in our data-base searches comparing the cβ <dig> specific sequence of human, bovine, mouse and zebra fish . interestingly, the cβ <dig> specific sequence was fairly well conserved even in the fish genome, indicating the presence of cβ <dig> in all vertebrates. a lower of degree of conservation is a feature generally associated with sequences not directly involved in catalysis, which again may suggest a more structural role for the n-terminal part of the protein.

expression of cβ <dig> protein seemed to be mostly restricted to lymphoid tissues, as the  <dig> kda band was present in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus, but not detectable in brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. in an earlier report cβ <dig> mrna was detected in bovine brain, heart, skeletal muscle, spleen and liver  <cit> . moreover, in human cβ <dig> has been detected by northern blotting in human kidney in addition to the same immune tissues as demonstrated for mouse  <cit> . the fact that we were unable to detect cβ <dig> protein in all tissues described in bovine and in kidney of human may imply that the protein is not present in these tissues or that the level of expression is below the level of detection for the antibodies used here.

using peptides corresponding to the cβ <dig> specific sequence, we made a polyclonal antibody. this antiserum was shown to be cβ <dig> specific in immunoblot assays.

guthrie et al.  <cit>  identified three cβ splice variants in mouse, with cβ <dig> expressed exclusively in the brain, encoding an additional  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus by alternative use of exons. it is therefore smaller than human and bovine cβ <dig> and is not expressed in the same tissues. in fact, the previously described mouse cβ <dig> is identical to the human splice variant designated cβ <dig>  which is expressed in the brain  <cit> . based on this evidence, the previously described murine cβ <dig> has now been renamed murine cβ <dig>  moreover, based on this and previous reports, we conclude that all mammals contain the isoforms cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>  these facts call for a revision of the present cβ splice variant nomenclature as given in table  <dig> 

*the old and new murine nomenclature has been indicated.

**the abc variants of cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>  have not been included in the table.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the murine homologue of human and bovine cβ <dig> is expressed in lymphoid cells. the previously published murine cβ <dig>  <cit>  is the murine homologue of human cβ <dig>  <cit> . taken together with previous reports we conclude that the murine cβ gene encodes cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>
