BACKGROUND
the genetic components underlying the response of plants to the photo-thermal environmental cues affecting seasonal and local adaptation are key factors that limit crops’ geographical distribution and yield potential. therefore, as they have critical implications for agricultural productivity, such components have become an important focus of applied research. the winter hardiness of temperate cereals refers to the ability of plants to withstand the chilling and freezing temperatures that occur during the winter season , and is also associated with vernalization requirement and photoperiod sensitivity, to maximise yield potential whilst minimising the risk of damage due to abiotic stresses. in economically important temperate cereals, like wheat and barley, the range of cultivated germplasm can be divided into winter, facultative and spring types, depending upon their requirement for vernalization to flower and set seed. in particular, facultative genotypes, although cold tolerant and able to survive winters, can be sown in spring as well and set seed without vernalizing  <cit> . the genetic control of frost tolerance is complex and is the final manifestation of several component traits. plants become tolerant to the effects of freezing through the acclimation process or hardening, i.e. a relatively slow, adaptive response during late autumn, signalled by a gradual decrease in temperature, day length and light intensity leading to a series of biochemical changes enhancing the cold resistance of sensitive tissues. frost tolerance also depends on the intrinsic capacity of the vegetative tissues to survive freeze-induced desiccation, and their efficient recovery from the stress  <cit> .

in the triticeae, major efforts to dissect the genetic basis of winter hardiness component traits, i.e. frost tolerance and induction of flowering by temperature and day length, have been mainly based on the use of bi-parental mapping populations of random recombinant lines in wheat and barley. the bi-parental studies led to the discovery of mostly major loci responsible for the traits. major quantitative trait loci  emerged as logical targets for gene cloning, and the causal candidate genes have been identified for many of them . in the case of frost tolerance, the literature in barley is scarce with most of the original qtl studies confounded with segregation of one or more major developmental genes. the ‘nure’  x ‘tremois’  barley population  <cit>  is at present the only example of biparental mapping in the triticeae where both frost resistance-h <dig>  fr-h <dig>  and frost resistance-h <dig>  fr-h <dig> segregated and were located on a genetic map, approximately  <dig> cm apart on the long arm of chromosome 5h. a cluster of at least  <dig> c-repeat binding factor  genes  <cit>  co-segregates with the barley  and the wheat  orthologous loci  <cit> . the cbf gene family has been shown to have a critical role in stress response in arabidopsis and encodes a small family of transcription factors that have been demonstrated to regulate cold acclimation response by controlling the level of cor  expression, which in turn promotes tolerance to freezing. in barley, it has been shown that variation in both expression levels and copy numbers of cbf genes is associated with low temperature tolerance differences amongst cultivars  <cit> . fr-h <dig> co-segregates with hvbm5a, the barley candidate gene for vrn-h <dig>  a major developmental locus governing barley vernalization requirement. allelic variation at the wheat vrn-a <dig> locus is sufficient to trigger the regulatory cascade that down-regulates the cold acclimatisation pathway  <cit> . a new major low temperature tolerance qtl, designated fr-h <dig>  has recently been discovered on barley chromosome 1h in the ‘nb3437f’  × ‘or71’  and the ‘nb713’  × ‘or71’ barley populations  <cit>  but the gene underlying fr-h <dig> has yet to be identified. other loci with minor effects on freezing tolerance at the vegetative stage have been mapped on barley chromosomes 1hl, 4hs and 4hl in the ‘dicktoo’  × ‘morex’  barley mapping population together with fr-h <dig> <cit> . a locus for frost induced sterility at the reproductive stage has been mapped distally on barley chromosome 2hl in the ‘haruna nijo’  × ‘galleon’  barley mapping population  <cit> . all these populations involve genetically broad crosses between winter  and spring growth habit parents, which therefore segregate for vrn-h <dig> and/or vrn-h <dig>   <cit>  that may obscure and complicate interpretation of the results.

although bi-parental mapping has been successful in identifying key genetic switches affecting frost tolerance in barley, it can be argued that both the limited size and the genetic origin of the mapping populations capture only a portion of the genetic diversity of the species. furthermore, the usually large pleiotropic and epistatic effects involving major genes segregating within bi-parental crosses limit our capacity to detect other loci with smaller effects and significant interactions amongst them and the environment.

the emergence of high throughput snp marker genotyping platforms enabled the implementation of genome-wide association studies  in crop plants, where the interest is considerable  <cit> . barley is a diploid autogamous crop plant where linkage disequilibrium  is predicted to be extensive  <cit> . therefore medium-resolution gwas can potentially be used to capture significant genetic effects segregating in the cultivated gene-pool  <cit>  and successful examples considering simply inherited traits have recently been published  <cit> . both these studies demonstrated that there is enough accumulated recombination within the cultivated gene-pool to identify and functionally validate the candidate genes responsible for the traits. for instance, cockram et al.  used a collection of  <dig> elite uk barley lines genotyped with  <dig> snp markers to identify the causal polymorphism for ant- <dig>  a major switch governing anthocyanin production in barley. ramsay et al.  used a genetically broader germplasm collection consisting of  <dig> american / european elite cultivars genotyped with  <dig> snp markers to identify the candidate gene for int-c, one of the genes controlling barley spike morphology. the candidate gene was then validated using a collection of well-characterized mutant stocks  <cit> . comadran et al.  used a genome-wide scan for divergent selection footprints in  <dig> spring and  <dig> winter two-rowed barley genotyped with the iselect 9k snp platform to identify the candidate gene for earliness per se  <dig> , a locus associated with spring growth habit and environmental adaptation in barley, which was validated by re-sequencing the candidate gene in a historical collection of putative early flowering mutants  <cit> .

three association mapping approaches for studies of frost tolerance have been published to date in the triticeae: two in barley and one in rye, the most frost tolerant species. a genome wide association study of winter hardiness traits using  <dig> snps to genotype north american barley germplasm identified significant associations on chromosome 5h  <cit> . in the fr-h <dig> region, two snps were significantly associated with the trait, one representing the hvcbf <dig> gene, and the other located in an est encoding a heat shock transcription factor . at the fr-h <dig> locus, a specific hvbm5a intron  <dig> amplicon showed the most significant association, whereas a third significant snp, about  <dig> cm proximal to hvbm5a, showed the highest homology to an arabidopsis gene predicted to code glutamyl-trna amidotransferase subunit c, a gene with no obvious relationship with frost tolerance. in a previous study using a different germplasm collection, the allelic variation of four out of the thirteen 5h barley cbf genes was studied in a panel of  <dig> spring and winter accessions. two nucleotide variants of hvcbf <dig> and one nucleotide variant of hvbm5a  were detected as being significantly associated with frost tolerance  <cit> . in rye, a study of eleven candidate genes involved in frost response   <cit>  found no association of frost tolerance with scvrn <dig>  although the authors did detect significant epistatic effects involving it.

progress in understanding the genetic basis of barley tolerance to low temperatures is often hindered by the unpredictability of the number, length and intensity of the frost episodes in field conditions and the difficulty in reproducing realistic field environments under controlled environment conditions. in a recent study, we utilized a panel of barley accessions representative of the mediterranean basin and nw europe to study barley adaptation to drought environments by analyzing genotypic, phenotypic and environmental data from  <dig> sites over two years  <cit> . we found strong genotype × environment interactions complicate the interpretation of the data as different associations may be detected in different environments and proposed joint analysis of all the data as a way to identify and prioritize main qtl effects that were robust over a broad range of environmental conditions  <cit> . in this way, we identified qtls for yield components, heading date, harvest index and plant height, many linked to known major developmental loci. during this study, we observed extremely cold winter conditions with severe and long freezing events with minimum temperatures ranging from −5°c to −10°c at the foradada  trial site in 2004/ <dig> without snow cover. in order to obtain a more reliable evaluation of cold damage, the same gemplasm panel was assessed for winter survival in the growing season 2007/ <dig> at fiorenzuola d’arda , where it was again subjected to cold stress. the data from these two trials represent a valuable opportunity to identify important genetic regions associated with frost tolerance in barley by gwas across a broad range of germplasm and to advance our understanding of the character.

RESULTS
environmental conditions and natural variation for frost tolerance in the association mapping panel
minimum and maximum temperatures recorded in foradada trial during the 2004/ <dig> winter show the severity of the frost episodes experienced by the panel, with long and extreme freezing periods, where minimum temperatures below 0°c were recorded for several consecutive weeks . the 2007/ <dig> winter in fiorenzuola was less severe with minimum temperatures oscillating between +5°c and -5°c . the average visual scores recorded for ‘nure’  and ‘tremois’  in fiorenzuola on the 0– <dig> scale were very similar to their multi-annual averages in the same location. repeatability  of cold tolerance measures in both trials was high .

as expected, analysis of variance of the trait revealed highly significant main effects of germplasm type , geographic origin, ear type, and seasonal growth habit , but no significant interactions were detected between these classifications . winter lines are generally more tolerant to freezing temperatures than spring types but great fluctuation of low temperature tolerance values can be observed amongst the spring lines, consistent with little selection pressure and the inclusion of facultative types in this class. interestingly, the most frost-tolerant lines were detected amongst turkish facultative types , which supports a report that frost tolerance in these accessions may be either due to other loci in addition to the linked pair fr-h1/vrn-h <dig> and fr-h <dig> on 5h, or alternatively, more hardy alleles at one or both loci  <cit> .

gwa mapping
using the tracy-widom statistic, we found that  <dig> eigenvectors were necessary to describe the population sub-structure in our germplasm panel explaining 60% of the genetic variance within the dataset. for the foradada dataset,  <dig> and  <dig> snps exceeded the significance threshold for eigenstrat and kinship mixed models, respectively . several of these qtls map in the same regions as loci previously reported to be involved in cold tolerance . snp 11_ <dig>  located on the long arm of chromosome 5h at  <dig> cm, is a polymorphism in hvcbf <dig> located within a physically linked cluster of at least  <dig> cbf family members ) that correspond to the frost resistance fr-h <dig> locus  <cit> . this marker is significantly associated with frost tolerance with both ‘intro’ and ‘tokak’ possessing the more tolerant allele. the significant association found with snp 11_ <dig> on the long arm of chromosome 2h at  <dig> cm is in the same region as the flt-2l flowering locus  <cit> , which has also been reported to be closely linked to a qtl controlling frost induced sterility at the reproductive stage  <cit> , although this association was only significant in the eigenstrat analysis. at this locus, ‘tokak’ carries the more tolerant allele and ‘intro’ the more susceptible one. other snps mapping in the region could help in detecting further recombinants and identifying putative candidate genes. snp 11_ <dig>  which is co-located on chromosome 4hl at  <dig> cm with snp 12_ <dig>  had the most significant association with low temperature tolerance in another gwas of cold tolerance in barley and both snps are located in the same beta amylase barley unigene   <cit> . both snps have been mapped ~ <dig> cm distal to other snps located in the barley vernalization gene vrn-h <dig> <cit> . in arabidopsis, one specific beta-amylase has been shown to have a key role for the cold-temperature dependent increase in soluble sugars and the associated protection of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and proteins in the chloroplast stroma during freezing stress  <cit> . a similar role could be suggested for the hvbmy <dig> underlying our association hit. both ‘intro’ and ‘tokak’ carry the more cold tolerant allele, which is associated with the winter allele at vrn-h <dig> . it is important to note that ‘tokak’, as a facultative line, does not carry the winter allele at vrn-h <dig>  <cit>  and in fact carries the spring allele at snp 11_ <dig>  which is co-located with snps in vrn-h <dig>  the same snp associations on chromosomes 2h and 5h were also significant at fiorenzuola but the significant snp on chromosome 4h was 11_ <dig>  approximately  <dig> cm proximal to vrn-h <dig>  although both ‘tokak’ and ‘intro’ again carried the more resistant winter allele which was in the majority. using eigenstrat, an additional  <dig> significant snps were detected at fiorenzuola but whilst the significant snp on 5h was also detected using kinship, no snps in the region of flt-2l were amongst the remaining  <dig> significant associations . apart from the three above loci, all the remaining significant associations are in regions which have not previously been reported as being related to frost tolerance. the most significant hit for the fiorenzuola trial  was located in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 2h at  <dig> cm. for the foradada trial, two of the  <dig> significant eigenstrat associations were co-located on chromosome 6h at  <dig>  cm, with the most significant  also being detected by kinship. ‘intro’ and ‘tokak’ carry the same allele at snp 11_ <dig>  which increases cold tolerance.

the turkish low temperature tolerant facultative line ‘tokak’ and the elite winter two-rowed cultivar ‘intro’ are used to illustrate typical cultivars genotypes with maximum cold tolerance scores in our trial conditions. * allele effects for the minor allele. ** maf minor allele frequency.

the most significant snp detected by gwas of the foradada phenotypes without population structure correction was located within  <dig> cm of hvbm5a, the barley vernalisation locus vrn-h <dig> , which is also considered the candidate gene for fr-h <dig>  on chromosome 5h at  <dig> cm  <cit> . as we would expect fr-h <dig> to be involved in frost tolerance, we can conclude that this is probably a genuine effect that is confounded with population sub-structure. as expected, the frost tolerant facultative and winter cultivars  <cit>  ‘tokak’ and ‘intro’ carry the more cold tolerant allele. two other highly significant associations were found for snps 11_ <dig> and 11_ <dig>  located on chromosome 3h at  <dig>  cm, when analysing the data without correction for sub-structure. based on synteny and colinearity with rice sequence data, these two snps are located  <dig> and  <dig> genes away from inducer of cbf expression  <dig> , a known regulatory gene of the cold tolerance pathway in arabidopsis. ‘tokak’ and ‘intro’ again carried the more resistant winter allele, showing an effect of  <dig>  in the foradada kinship analysis. the more resistant allele notably was in the majority, despite the winters comprising just 25% of the lines. interestingly, an association mapping study of frost tolerance in rye using a candidate gene approach identified a rye ice <dig> homologue snp as the most significant hit in field trials  <cit> . the barley homologue of ice <dig> was mapped in the same position in a previous study  <cit> . although still significant, the association of snps 11_ <dig> and 11_ <dig> with the fiorenzuola phenotypes was not so strong using an uncorrected gwas. a more highly significant association was detected with snp 11_ <dig>  which is located distal on chromosome 3h at  <dig>  cm . clearly, frost tolerance is subject to genotype x environment interactions, which might be related to the severity of the stress. such effects will be reflected in qtl x environment interactions leading to snps being significant at one site but not the other.

qtl frequencies and linkage disequilibrium 
classic ld parameters  as implemented by haploview v. <dig>   were used to test whether the significant snps were in strong ld with each other. the presence of very strong ld would raise concerns about a high rate of false positives present in our results whilst complete absence of ld between the positive snps would provide evidence of complete independence between qtls. we only observed significant ld between snps 11_ <dig> and 11_ <dig> , both located on chromosome 2h at  <dig>  and  <dig> cm, respectively, suggesting their effects are not independent. for the rest of the snps we did not observe signs of strong inter-qtl ld resulting from population substructure and admixture within our panel even for closely linked significant snps detected at foradada such as 11_ <dig> and 11_ <dig> both mapping on chromosome 6h at  <dig> cm . with an average r <dig> value of  <dig>  for all  <dig> possible combinations between the  <dig> significantly associated snps, most observed r <dig> values were < <dig> . only four, which were amongst the six possible combinations between snps 11_ <dig>  11_ <dig>  11_ <dig>  and 11_ <dig>  were greater than  <dig>  and none exceeded  <dig>  . such r <dig> values are not strong enough to suggest non-independence between qtl regions but they might add some evidence of co-selection, a reasonable situation when measuring traits of high agronomic/economic importance subjected to a long history of breeding and selection. for example, despite a contrasting breeding origin, ‘intro’ and ‘tokak’ possess the same alleles at all the significant snps associated with frost tolerance in the kinship model .

in order to understand which genotypes possess favourable frost tolerance alleles, we examined qtl diversity and distribution in the different genetic clusters of our gwa panel. we evaluated the genetic relationships among the accessions by generating a neighbour-joining population tree based on simple matching of allelic distances as implemented in darwin v. <dig>   <cit> , which produced clearly separated branches corresponding to each of our germplasm origin groupings:   <dig> northern european springs,   <dig> turkish,   <dig> syrian and jordan,   <dig> south-west mediterranean accessions and   <dig> northern european winters . this analysis provided the same groupings as the bayesian cluster analysis implemented in the program structure  <cit>  and principal coordinates results described in previous publications  <cit> . subsequent qtl haplotype analysis for the eight significant snps detected with the kinship analysis in the foradada and/or the fiorenzuola field trials highlighted a large number of different allelic combinations within the ‘northern european springs’ germplasm, with one specific combination of the qtl alleles fixed or nearly fixed in both winter clusters . a high degree of allelic fixation was also observed within the cold tolerant ‘turkish’ and ‘syrian and jordan’ clusters .

discussion
genome wide association analysis has arisen as a powerful tool to dissect quantitative traits as it potentially provides higher resolution qtl mapping than bi-parental studies and is therefore of interest to both the academic and commercial sectors  <cit> . a recent gwas study using  <dig> advanced breeding barley lines identified qtls for frost tolerance in the region of fr-h <dig> and fr-h <dig> but the combined effect of both loci explained just 25% of the phenotypic variation, suggesting undetected genetic variation elsewhere  <cit> . the study  <cit>  utilized advanced breeding material where linkage disequilibrium  was extensive; r <dig> ld values higher than  <dig>  persisted for  <dig> cm and  <dig> cm around fr-h <dig> and fr-h <dig>  respectively. strong ld values across long genetic distances such as those found in the region of fr-h <dig> and fr-h <dig> usually arise from inbreeding and recent selection  and can be an indication of strong population stratification. both aspects affect random segregation of alleles within the genome and constitute real handicaps for association mapping studies.

studies sampling advanced breeding material could be severely limited by the effects of inbreeding and/or selection. our approach of using landraces and old cultivars from distinct geographical origins samples a longer history of recombination events, which will dilute the effects of ld related to inbreeding. however, by sampling spring, facultative and winter genotypes, we inevitably introduced sources of population structure and the need to account for them in our analyses. we accounted for population structure in the analysis by using a mixed linear model with either the eigenstrat relationship model with pca scores as a random terms or a kinship matrix to correct for population substructure. for comparison, we also conducted gwas without any correction for population substructure, as we believed that some critical genes may well be confounded with the population sub-structure existing in our germplasm panel. current barley genome map coverage and knowledge about the role of fr-h <dig> and inducer of cbf expression  <dig>  ice <dig>  in cold tolerance  <cit>  suggests that the strong associations in the “uncorrected” approach tightly linked to both loci represent true genetic effects that need to be included in improvement of frost tolerance rather than false positives introduced by the absence of population structure correction in the analysis . similarly, the flt-2l related hits  - with extensive literature on the involvement of this genomic region in frost sensitivity in reproductive tissues  <cit>  - in both foradada and fiorenzuola eigenstrat analyses do not reach the statistical threshold using the kinship approach, which is the most conservative method of analysis of the three that we adopted. correction for population structure in gwas performed in highly stratified populations can therefore result in important associations being undetected. whilst it is necessary to avoid an inflated rate of false positives arising from the genetic stratification of the germplasm, we have found that true associations might not be detected due to a complete confounding with the population structure of the germplasm. in this example,  <dig> of the  <dig> top hits  identified in the uncorrected approach fail to reach the significance threshold in both eigenstrat and kinship analyses.

the most conservative of our gwas analyses  detected six and four significantly associated snps for frost tolerance from the foradada and fiorenzuola trials respectively. snp 11_ <dig>  linked to fr-h <dig> , was detected in both trials  and was the most significant association detected under the severe cold conditions experienced in foradada in 2004/ <dig>  although fr-h <dig> was also significant in the milder winter conditions experienced in fiorenzuola in 2007/ <dig>  it is interesting that the most significant association for this environment was found for snp 11_ <dig>  located in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 2h , that has not previously been reported. this region of the genome is, however linked to varying degrees to the more distal ppd-h <dig>  and the earliness per se locus eps-h <dig> locus   <cit> . the history of selection in regions such as this one with major developmental genes often leaves complicated linkage disequilibrium patterns which add confusion to the interpretation of results. ‘intro’ and ‘tokak’ carry the more frost tolerant alleles at the 11_ <dig> locus and ‘intro’ also carries the earlier flowering allele at eps-h <dig> so, one would think that earlier flowering would make a plant more susceptible to frost damage. although study of ld between snps representing ppd-h <dig> and eps-h <dig> and 11_ <dig> shows that they are in equilibrium and that we may have identified a genuine effect and not something that is confounded with maturity differences at ppd-h <dig> and eps-h <dig>  further research is necessary to properly characterise this region. the other novel regions detected are also interesting findings that are worthy of future research.

exploration of the allelic frequencies of the significantly associated snps detected by kinship analysis revealed that the more frost tolerant allele at most of the qtl is genetically fixed or nearly fixed within the winter barley germplasm . the more frost tolerant alleles are also nearly fixed or fixed within the syrian and jordan landraces  and the turkish facultative lines  respectively, both known to be winter hardy. in contrast, most qtls are freely segregating within the spring germplasm  with a noticeably greater range of haplotypes and none of the  <dig> observed  dominating. the south-west mediterranean lines represent an intermediate situation with four more dominant  haplotypes but definitely much more variation than the other autumn sown groups . two noteworthy conclusions can therefore be drawn. firstly, the majority of spring × winter crosses will sample variation in frost tolerance that is mostly dependent upon the genetic make-up of the spring parent. secondly, working within diverse un-adapted spring germplasm pools is a useful alternative strategy as it would avoid complications associated with the pleiotropic effects of major developmental genes segregating in spring x winter crosses, and would minimize the statistical issues relative to the inherent population structure of the germplasm. clearly, whilst true winter genotypes represent just over 25% of our germplasm panel, the frost tolerant alleles are generally the most frequent . it is also highly possible that the cold adapted winter gene pool contains additional alleles that were not detected by our analyses. although we might expect such effects to be minor, we have sampled a limited number of environments yet highlighted the potential importance of qtl × environment interactions. future work should be directed towards suitably augmenting the genetic diversity of the panel and increasing the environmental diversity to which it is exposed in order to obtain as complete as possible survey of frost tolerance genetics. the information we have generated is also valuable to choose parental lines to use in crosses  to complement the gwas data and analyse some of the novel associations in more detail. however, as the genetic determinants underlying major loci fr-h <dig> and fr-h <dig> have already been identified, population numbers will need to be increased in order to capture effects that can be masked by the pleiotropic effects of such major loci. moreover, larger populations will be useful to detect epistatic effects that have naturally been accumulating in cultivated germplasm, but will probably be undetected in bi-parental populations due to the random effects of segregation without selection.

an attractive alternative which does not involve the development of new plant material to be tested involves the ultra-saturation of the genome by emerging new generation sequencing technologies such as genotyping by sequencing   <cit> . these technologies promise a deeper coverage of polymorphic sequence information and therefore increase the likelihood of identifying polymorphisms more closely linked to a character, if not the causal polymorphism itself, thus providing a manageable shortlist of gene candidates to be functionally tested. at the same time, techniques like gbs provide an unbiased assessment of the diversity at every single gene sampled, which will result in a fast implementation of the results arising from those data in the form of specific haplotype and allele information tightly linked to the regions of interest, facilitating the direct identification of the causal polymorphism. these could be efficiently used as new molecular tools in marker assisted selection  programs, aiming to accumulate the frost tolerant alleles in acceptable genetic backgrounds to be used in breeding programmes and potentially increase the overall frost tolerance of barley.

CONCLUSIONS
progress in understanding the genetic basis of barley tolerance to low temperatures is often hindered by the unpredictability of the number, length and intensity of the frost episodes in field conditions and the difficulty in reproducing realistic field environments in controlled experiments. frost tolerance gwas in field conditions from two trial sites experiencing extreme cold conditions provided invaluable data for the genetic dissection of the trait in barley. two of the significant associations were tightly linked to the fr-h <dig> and hvbmy loci on chromosomes 5h and 4hl, respectively. the other significant associations were located in genomic regions that have not previously been associated with cold stress. however, some critical genes may well be confounded with the population sub-structure existing in our germplasm panel gwas conducted without any correction for population substructure identified significant associations tightly linked to fr-h <dig>  flt-2l and inducer of cbf expression  <dig>  ice <dig> loci on chromosomes 5h, 2hl and 3hl, respectively. thus, providing evidence that correcting for population structure in highly stratified populations can result in important associations being undetected. linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analyses of the kinship significant snp associations showed they are genetically independent and that most of the significant snp loci are fixed in the winter or facultative types, while they are freely segregating within the un-adapted spring barley genepool. although there is a major interest in detecting new variation to improve frost tolerance of available winter and facultative types, from a gwas perspective, working within the un-adapted spring germplasm pool is an attractive alternative strategy which would minimize statistical issues, simplify the interpretation of the data and identify phenology independent genetic determinants of frost tolerance.”
