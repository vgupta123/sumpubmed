BACKGROUND
the genomic information on insects has increased tremendously during last several years. whole genomes have been sequenced for several insect species, including the fruit fly   <cit> , african malaria mosquito   <cit> , yellow fever mosquito   <cit> , honey bee   <cit> , silkworm   <cit> , red flour beetle   <cit> , and  <dig> other drosophila species  <cit> . genome sequencing of other insect species, including pea aphid , northern house mosquito , three species of parasitoid wasp , hessian fly , blood sucking bug , and body louse , are currently in progress  <cit> . the red flour beetle is the only agricultural insect pest whose whole genome sequence has become available to date.

lepidoptera, the second most biodiverse group of insect species after coleoptera, represents more than  <dig>  species including many of the most devastating pests of crops, forests and stored products  <cit> . the silkworm was the first lepidopteran insect to have its complete genome sequenced  <cit> . however, genomic information for other lepidopterans, particularly agricultural pest species is limited but urgently needed due to their economic importance and biodiversity. sequencing of the expressed sequence tags  has been recognized as an economical approach to identify a large number of expressed genes that can be used in gene expression and other genomic studies  <cit> . indeed, ests have been generated from several lepidopteran insects including the silkworm  <cit> , spruce budworm   <cit> , cotton bollworm   <cit> , diamondback moth   <cit> , tobacco hawkmoth   <cit> , and fall armyworm   <cit> .

it has been long recognized that the insect gut is an important target for developing new strategies for insect pest management. until now, however, only a few studies have focused on the development of gut-specific est libraries of lepidopterans as a tool to identify candidate genes involved in the toxicity of insecticides and the development of insecticide resistance. gut-specific est libraries were reported for light brown apple moth    <cit> , bertha armyworm    <cit> , and european corn borer    <cit> .

ecb is one of the most destructive pests of corn and can cause as much as $ <dig> billion of economic loss annually in the united states alone  <cit> . ecb also represents a complex of stalk borers, such as the southwestern corn borer  and the sugarcane borer . these stalk borers share similar ecosystem and create similar damage to corn plants. although ecb has been successfully managed using transgenic bt corn hybrids , there are increasing concerns about the potential development of bt resistance in ecb because of the widespread use of bt corn  <cit> . indeed, several ecb colonies have developed resistance to bt toxins under laboratory selection conditions  <cit> .

the main target for bt toxins is the insect midgut, where bt protoxins are activated by gut proteases to produce activated bt toxins. the activated toxins then bind to specific receptor to confer toxicity  <cit> . this means that insect resistance to bt toxins could be conferred by protease-mediated and receptor-mediated mechanisms  <cit> . because bt toxins and insect gut interactions are determined by many gene products in the insect gut, including many proteins/enzymes involved in bt protoxin activation, toxin binding to receptors and toxin degradation, any change in these systems has the potential to affect a particular bt's specificity and efficacy, and could lead to bt resistance in insects.

our goals are to develop a gut-specific est database from ecb larvae and explore candidate genes that are potentially involved in insect-bt interactions and bt resistance. in this paper, we report the analysis and annotations of  <dig>  ests derived from the gut of ecb larvae. we discuss the putative identities of the ests, their potential biological and molecular functions, and present comparative analyses of our ests with sequences from other insects. this work provides the opportunity for developing an ecb gut-specific microarray that can be used to study insect-bt interactions and genetic basis of bt resistance in ecb. furthermore, we revealed  <dig> candidate genes that could be involved in bt toxicity and resistance. among the  <dig> selected candidate genes examined by rt-pcr, we found  <dig> genes with apparently decreased expressions and  <dig> with increased expressions in cry1ab-resistant strain of ecb as compared with the susceptible strain of ecb. differential expressions of these genes in a cry1ab-resistant strain may suggest possible involvement of these genes in cry1ab resistance, and therefore provides us with new insights into the mechanism of cry1ab resistance in ecb. this study may serve as a model for studying bt resistance mechanisms and for developing bio-pesticides for all closely related corn stalk borers.

RESULTS
development and analysis of the ecb gut ests
we first used ppcr-xl-topo plasmid vector to prepare a cdna library using total rna purified from the whole guts of fifth-instar larvae of ecb. after we sequenced a total of  <dig>  cdna clones, we found that the cdna inserts in the vector were not sufficient long . therefore, we used lambda uni-zap rx vector to prepare a second cdna library using mrna purified from the guts of fifth-instar larvae of ecb. this library provided us with much longer cdna inserts . because of this significantly improved quality of the ests generated from the lambda library, we used the lambda library for our further sequencing of ests. among the  <dig>  random cdna clones sequenced, only <8% were from the plasmid library whereas >92% were from the lambda library .

a the poor quality sequences were discarded and were not included in the analysis.

b the numbers of contigs and singletons were based on the analysis of all the ests sequenced from the two libraries.

our analysis of the  <dig>  sequences resulted in  <dig>  readable sequences . these sequences were first trimmed for removal of vector sequences and then were subjected to filtration to exclude the sequences of < <dig> bp. further analysis, using repeatmasker and organelle masker programs  <cit> , removed an additional  <dig> sequences. thus, the total number of high quality sequences obtained was  <dig>   with an average length of  <dig> bp . these high quality sequences have been deposited in the est database  with genbank accession numbers from gh <dig> to gh <dig> at the national center for biotechnology information . redundancy and assembly analyses of the high quality sequences using sequencher software  resulted in  <dig>  unique ests, including  <dig>  contiguous sequences  that consist of  <dig> or more sequences, and  <dig>  singletons that represent single sequences. the majority of the contigs were assembled from  <dig> or fewer ests . on average, however, each contig was assembled from  <dig>  sequences due to a few highly redundant ests. putative identities of the unique sequences were determined by searching the non-redundant database in genbank using blastx. among the  <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig>   showed significant matches at e-values of ≤ 10- <dig>  whereas the remaining  <dig>   did not exhibit meaningful matches .

transcript abundance
the abundance of transcripts for a particular gene of an organism can be estimated from the corresponding est abundance in a cdna library  <cit> . the most abundant ests in our cdna libraries were those encoding trypsin-like proteases and chymotrypsin-like proteases . as this cdna library was constructed from the gut of ecb, the high number of transcripts from the digestive enzymes was expected. the most abundant contig was # <dig> which consisted of  <dig> ests, and it included 4% of the total sequences. this contig shared maximum sequence similarity with the trypsin-like protease, t <dig> precursor, characterized previously in ecb  <cit> . other abundant transcripts were contigs # <dig> and # <dig>  contig # <dig> included  <dig> ests and encoded a putative chymotrypsin-like protease. contig # <dig> included  <dig> ests and encoded a putative trypsin-like serine protease. the highly expressed genes in ecb larval gut may have important implications for their growth and development. however, care must be taken in making general conclusions about the redundancy of est's because some artifacts could also be involved  <cit> .

identification of the orf and putative secretary proteins
the  <dig>  contigs and singletons were subjected to the orf predictor software to identify the open reading frame  of the sequences. this was done to identify the novel gene candidates, which have clear coding capacity. among  <dig>  unique ests,  <dig>   had orfs of at least  <dig> bp. among  <dig>  orfs,  <dig> putative protein sequences  shared sequence similarity  with known proteins in the non-redundant  protein database in genbank, whereas  <dig>  did not share significant similarity with any known protein in the same database . thus, at least  <dig> % of the protein-coding genes in the gut of ecb are potentially new genes. the remaining  <dig>  contigs and singletons  had an orf of < <dig> bp and  <dig>  did not have an orf. among the ests with orfs of < <dig> bp,  <dig>  had matches in the nr protein database, whereas  <dig>   did not have matches. many sequences did not have orf of ≥  <dig> bp because the sequences were too short . the lack of the orfs in other sequences can be due to frame shift errors, 5' truncation of cdna clones and the ests that were not derived from mrna  <cit> .

to identify the secretory proteins, putative protein sequences were examined to identify potential secretion signal peptide using signalp software  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  putative proteins were predicted to contain signal peptides . among the putative secretory proteins,  <dig> sequences  had matches with known proteins in the nr protein database, whereas  <dig> putative secretory proteins  were unique, sharing no significant sequence similarity with any known protein. this information is valuable since secretory proteins are important components of biological processes in the gut  <cit> .

comparative analyses of ecb gut ests
the development of est databases has been recognized as a rapid method of sampling an organism's transcriptome and is complementary to a whole genome-sequencing project  <cit> . indeed, a large number of ests have been generated from other model organisms. the  <dig>  contigs and singletons obtained from the larval gut of ecb were compared with the sequences from other organisms. the first hits  of the sequences in the nr database were taken into account to determine the most similar organism. the largest number of first hit sequences  came up with b. mori . this can be explained by the fact that the genome of b. mori has been sequenced and partially annotated, and that both ecb and b. mori are lepidopterans. the second largest number of first hit sequences  was with t. castaneum, followed by ae. aegypti , culex pipiens , and a. gambiae . only  <dig> % of the sequences  were found to be most similar to predicted protein sequences from o. nubilalis. this is simply due to the very small number of sequences currently available in ncbi database from ecb.

in order to compare our ecb gut ests with the  <dig>  ecb ests that are already available in ncbi database, we performed blastn searches. among our  <dig>  contigs and singletons,  <dig>   had significant matches at a cutoff e-value of ≤ 10- <dig> whereas  <dig>   did not show any significant matches in ncbi database using blastn search. we compared our ecb ests with the ecb ests available in ncbi dbest database. we found  <dig> sequences  that had significant matches with e-values less than e- <dig> . within this category,  <dig> ests  had matches with e-values less than e- <dig>   <dig>  had e-values between e- <dig> and e- <dig>   <dig>  had e-values of e- <dig> and e- <dig>   <dig>  had e-values of e- <dig> and e- <dig>  and  <dig>  had e-values between e- <dig> and e- <dig> . a total of  <dig>  ests  had no hits with currently available midgut ests in ncbi database.

because b. mori genome has not been fully annotated, we have also compared our ests with all available b. mori ests using blastn. among the  <dig>  contigs and singletons,  <dig>  had hits with b. mori sequences at e-value < 10- <dig> . the remaining  <dig>  ests  did not show a significant match with the b. mori sequences. among the  <dig> unique ests which had hits in the database,  <dig>  had matches with e-value less than e- <dig>   <dig>  had e-values between e- <dig> and e- <dig>   <dig>  had e-values between e- <dig> and e- <dig>   <dig>  had e-values between e- <dig> and e- <dig>  and  <dig> sequences  had e-values between e- <dig> and e- <dig> .

gene ontology
blast2go software was used to obtain the gene ontology  terms for the unique sequences by comparing them through the gene ontology consortium  <cit> . among the  <dig>  contigs and singletons,  <dig>  showed blast hits at e-value ≤ 10- <dig> and  <dig>  ests of the  <dig>  were mapped. a total of  <dig> mapped ests showed both the go terms and enzyme commission  numbers. figure  <dig> shows the est functional categories, where the ecb unique ests were assigned to putative biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. within the biological process category,  <dig> % belong to cellular processes, followed by  <dig> % metabolic processes,  <dig> % developmental processes,  <dig> % multi-cellular processes, and  <dig> % each for biological regulation and localization. in the molecular function category, the maximum go terms  are included in catalytic activity, followed by binding , transporter activity , and  <dig> % each for enzyme regulation activity and structural molecular activity . in cellular components category, cell part, cell, and organelle had  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the go terms, respectively. they were followed by organelle part , macromolecular complex , envelope , and membrane-enclosed lumen .

identification of ests potentially relevant to the bt toxicity and resistance
the mode of bt action in insects includes the ingestion of bt protoxins, solubilization of bt protoxins in insect gut, proteolytic activation of protoxins, binding of toxins to bt receptors, membrane integration, pore formation, cell lysis, and insect death  <cit> . according to this mode of action, a target insect could potentially develop resistance to bt protoxins or toxins via one or more changes in the bt-receptor interaction pathway. indeed, the two most commonly identified bt resistance mechanisms are protease-mediated and receptor-mediated resistance  <cit> . our analysis of ests derived from the larval gut of ecb revealed a number of genes that are potentially involved in bt toxicity and resistance . specifically, we identified  <dig> ests putatively encoding trypsin-like proteases and  <dig> ests putatively encoding chymotrypsin-like proteases with e-value ranges from 2e- <dig> to 3e- <dig> and e-value 3e- <dig> to 3e- <dig>  respectively. changes in the proteolytic activity of digestive enzymes can alter the toxicity of bt protoxins or toxins through effects on crystal solubilization and/or activation of protoxins, as well as degradation of activated toxin  <cit> . a previous study from our lab has shown that bt resistance in a dipel-resistant strain of ecb was primarily associated with reduced trypsin-like protease activity  <cit> . these trypsin-like proteases were also revealed in our est analysis. thus, our analysis of the ests generated from the guts of ecb larvae revealed many more candidate genes that deserve further analysis for their roles in bt toxicity and resistance in ecb.

our est analysis also revealed  <dig> ests putatively encoding aminopeptidases ,  <dig> encoding a cadherin-like protein , and  <dig> encoding alkaline phosphatases . aminopeptidase n, cadherin-like proteins, and alkaline phosphatases have been found to serve as bt toxin binding receptors in other insect species  <cit> . to verify the function of aminopeptidase n as a receptor for bt cry1ac toxin in spodoptera litura, rnai technology was used to reduce the expression of aminopeptidase n. this resulted in a significant reduction in the susceptibility of the insect to cry1ac toxin  <cit> . gahan et al.  <cit>  showed that in a resistant strain  of heliothis virescens, there was a disruption of a cadherin-superfamily gene by a retrotransposon-mediated insertion that resulted in high levels of resistance to the bt toxin cry1ac. fernandez et al.  <cit>  also reported that a gpi -anchored alp  was an important receptor molecule involved in cry11aa interactions with midgut cells and toxicity to ae. aegypti larvae. these studies demonstrate that aminopeptidases, cadherin-like proteins, and alkaline phosphatases can serve as bt toxin receptors involved in bt toxicity and resistance. thus, identification of these candidate bt receptor genes in this study will allow us to further examine whether receptor-mediated resistance is involved in bt resistance in ecb.

comparison of expression profiles between cry1ab-susceptible and resistant strains of ecb
we performed rt-pcr to compare the expression patterns of the candidate genes relevant to bt toxicity and resistance between cry1ab-susceptible and resistant strains of ecb. among  <dig> selected genes from the  <dig> candidate genes, which included  <dig> that putatively code for trypsin-like serine proteases,  <dig> for chymotrypsin-like serine proteases,  <dig> for aminopeptidases,  <dig> for alkaline phosphatases, and  <dig> for cadherin-like protein, we found apparently decreased expressions in  <dig> trypsin-like and  <dig> chymotrypsin-like protease genes, and  <dig> aminopeptidase genes in the resistant strain as compared with the susceptible strain . among these genes,  <dig> trypsin-like protease genes  were virtually absent in the resistant strain. in contrast, we found apparently increased expressions in  <dig> trypsin-like and  <dig> chymotrypsin-like protease genes,  <dig> aminopeptidase genes, and  <dig> alkaline phosphatase genes in the resistant strain. the most noticeable increases were found in  <dig> trypsin-like protease ,  <dig> chymotrypsin-like protease ,  <dig> alkaline phosphatase , and  <dig> aminopeptidase  genes.

although rt-pcr is not quantitative, reproducible results of such differential expression patterns for these candidate genes in the cry1ab-susceptible and resistant strains of ecb may imply their potential roles in conferring or contributing to cry1ab resistance as well as genetic differences between the susceptible and resistant strains of ecb. indeed, certain trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases have previously been found to activate or degrade bt protoxins and toxins, whereas several aminopeptidases, cadherin-like proteins and alkaline phosphatases have been demonstrated to serve as bt receptor proteins in other insect species. thus, our results may help conclusively identify the candidate genes involved in cry1ab resistance and provide us with new insights into the mechanism of cry1ab resistance in ecb. nevertheless, further research will be needed to confirm their involvements and to elucidate their roles in cry1ab resistance in ecb.

CONCLUSIONS
our study resulted in a gut-specific est database containing  <dig>  high-quality ests from a total of  <dig>  ests sequenced in an agriculturally important lepidopteran pest. to our knowledge, this database represents the largest gut-specific est database from a lepidopteran pest. our analysis using orf predictor software showed that approximately  <dig> % of the protein coding genes in our database may be specific to ecb as these sequences have an orf of at least  <dig> bp but did not have significant matches with known sequences in ncbi database. we have also identified  <dig> candidate genes that are relevant to bt toxicity and resistance. these genes encode trypsin-like proteases, chymotrypsin-like proteases, aminopeptidases, cadherin-like protein, and alkaline phosphatases. furthermore, we showed differential expressions of  <dig> out of the  <dig> representative candidate genes that were examined by rt-pcr, including  <dig> genes with apparently decreased expressions and  <dig> with increased expressions in cry1ab-resistant strain. these results may help us further narrow down the candidate genes possibly involved in cry1ab resistance, and provide us with new insights into the mechanism of bt resistance in general in ecb.

we are in the process of developing a microarray using our unique ests together with the ecb gut-specific sequences which are already available in the genbank. the microarray technology will help us analyze the global change of gene expression in response to bt protoxins/toxins. it will also allow us to analyze any genetic differences between bt resistant and -susceptible strains of ecb. our genomic information on ecb could also serve as a valuable resource for identifying critical/vulnerable genes from the gut of ecb that would make useful physiological targets for new toxins that could be developed for use in pest management.
