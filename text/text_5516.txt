BACKGROUND
treatment-resistant depression is a serious issue in psychiatry as a significant number of affected individuals show an inadequate response to single antidepressant therapy. an emerging strategy to achieve maximum mood stabilization for treatment-resistant depression, bipolar illness and depression with psychotic features is the augmentation of fluoxetine  with novel anti-psychotic agents such as olanzapine . indeed, a number of clinical trials have suggested that such an augmentation strategy offers superior efficacy for treating resistant major depression when compared with either fluoxetine or olanzapine alone  <cit> . despite the apparent clinical benefits of this drug strategy, little is known about the mechanisms by which fluoxetine plus olanzapine actually function to relieve depression. the limited literature on this issue suggests that drug augmentation therapy, at least in the rat brain, is likely to be more complicated and perhaps more indirect than a simplistic version of fluoxetine or olanzapine would imply  <cit> . for instance, whereas fluoxetine and olanzapine alone activate several signaling pathways involved in cell survival and plasticity  <cit> , drug augmentation therapy reduces the levels of certain transcription factors  implicated in the chemical circuitry  underlying emotional behaviors  <cit> . consequently, it is conceivable that fluoxeine plus olanzapine treatment is effective against treatment-resistant depression due to their combined actions on numerous brain regions and various interconnected intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately promote some type of prophylactic effect.

we have previously shown that sub-chronic  administration of fluoxetine plus olanzapine results in a significant reduction of weight gain in rats  <cit> . this finding is of significant interest as fluoxetine and olanzapine alone have distinct and opposite effects on body weight dynamics in both rodents and humans. for example fluoxetine often reduces food intake and thus body weight in rats during sub-chronic and chronic  drug regimens  <cit> , an effect apparently mediated by fluoxetine impact on serotonin  signaling pathways  <cit> . in sharp contrast, treatment with olanzapine is associated with significant weight gain in schizophrenic patients, a serious side effect that may increase the risk for type ii diabetes and may also lead to treatment non-compliance  <cit> . in this case it is thought that olanzapine's particular affinity for 5-ht , dopamine , acetylcholine muscarinic  and histamine  receptors distributed widely in limbic neural circuits may somehow account for the pharmacological basis of olanzapine-induced weight gain  <cit> . needless to say, understanding body weight dynamics in relation to drug augmentation therapy is of critical importance if we are going to gain further knowledge on the mechanisms of therapeutic action and side effect profile of anti-depressant medications. in this regard, appetite disturbances are noted in many medicated depressed patients and several peptide transmitters implicated in feeding behavior co-exist in the hypothalamus and may therefore be involved in the onset of affective states  <cit> . in this study, we have examined in more detail the effects of fluoxetine  plus olanzapine treatment on rat body weight during the time course of  <dig> days under two olanzapine doses:  <dig> and  <dig>  mg/kg. in addition, we have measured blood levels of these two drugs using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry  to assess their combined pharmacology and their correlation to body weight dynamics.

RESULTS
all rats tolerated the fluoxetine plus olanzapine regimen well. there were no mortalities as a result of  <dig> days of drug administration in any of the rat groups tested. the only apparent untoward side effect was tissue necrosis in the peritoneum of rats injected with fluoxetine plus  <dig> or  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine . thus, fluoxetine appears to produce focal necrotising vasculitis within the site of injection. the necrotic properties of the above antidepressant have previously been reported  <cit> . olanzapine, on the other hand, does not produce tissue necrosis in the peritoneal cavities of rats when administered alone .

all rats showed a steady increase in body weight during the  <dig> days of cyclodextrin or fluoxetine plus olanzapine treatment. however, fluoxetine in combination with olanzapine significantly retarded this growth rate  when compared with the vehicle-treated group . this weight loss, beginning on day  <dig> of treatment, was observed equally in both the  <dig> and  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine-treated groups. at this time, rats administered with cyclodextrin showed body weights of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g, whereas fluoxetine plus  <dig> mg/kg olanzapine-treated animals showed weights of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g . along the same lines on day  <dig>  rats treated with fluoxetine plus  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine showed body weights of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g. in contrast, their vehicle-treated cohorts showed weights of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g . the magnitude of this difference in body weight increased further on day  <dig> and was firmly established by day  <dig> of drug augmentation therapy . thus, fluoxetine treatment, irrespective of olanzapine's ability to cause weight gain, produces a gradual and considerable weight loss in male rats. in general, these findings are consistent with mono-therapy studies where chronic olanzapine treatment invariably leads to weight loss in rodents  <cit> .

the fact that fluoxetine plus olanzapine treatment for  <dig> days retards the continuous weight gain observed in cyclodextrin-exposed rats suggests at least two testable possibilities. first, rats exposed to drug augmentation therapy might be eating less than their cyclodextrin-treated cohorts. second, administration of fluoxetine plus olanzapine might be altering glucose metabolism of drug-treated animals. to test the first possibility, we measured average food intake over a  <dig> hr period of the dark cycle in rats treated with fluoxetine plus  <dig> mg/kg olanzapine. on day  <dig> of drug treatment, rats exposed to this drug augmentation regimen ate significantly less  than vehicle-treated animals . interestingly, the same group of rats also showed a significant reduction in water intake  when compared with cyclodextrin-treated animals . thus, rats exposed to fluoxetine plus  <dig> mg/kg olanzapine are eating  and drinking  less at day  <dig> and  <dig> of drug treatment, respectively.

in contrast to the above findings, animals injected first with fluoxetine and then  <dig> min later with  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine did not show differences in food  or water  consumption during the dark cycle when compared with cyclodextrin-treated rats . thus, although fluoxetine plus  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine-treated rats show a significant and progressive weight loss at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this weight loss is not associated with reductions in food or water consumption. this finding suggests that chronic olanzapine treatment is apparently modifying feeding behavior in rats, an effect particularly conspicuous at the  <dig> mg/kg dose. to test the second possibility, that chronic fluoxetine plus olanzapine is altering the metabolism of drug-treated animals, we measured their blood glucose levels under fasting conditions . glucose levels at the time of sacrifice were not significantly different between cyclodextrin- and drug-treated animals at either the  <dig> mg/kg olanzapine dose  or the lower  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine dose . thus, changes in glucose metabolism are not the proximate cause affecting the differential body weight dynamics, nor the differential consumption of food and water among vehicle- and drug-treated rats. along the same lines, levels of the hormone leptin did not differ between cyclodextrin- and drug-treated animals , thus suggesting that chronic fluoxetine and olanzapine drug therapy does not affect leptin messages under fasted conditions in male rats.

we next assessed the pharmacokinetic profile of fluoxetine and olanzapine in rats treated with the above drug combination pattern . at doses of  <dig> mg/kg and  <dig> mg/kg respectively, fluoxetine plasma levels ranged from  <dig> ng/ml to  <dig> ng/ml. in contrast norfluoxetine levels ranged from  <dig> ng/ml to  <dig> ng/ml. norfluoxetine is the only identified active metabolite of fluoxetine; it is formed through n-demethylation of the parent molecule. plasma concentrations of olanzapine ranged from  <dig> ng/ml to  <dig> ng/ml. at doses of  <dig> mg/kg fluoxetine and  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine, levels of the antidepressant drug ranged from  <dig> ng/ml to  <dig> ng/ml, whereas those for norfluoxetine ranged from  <dig> ng/ml to  <dig> ng/ml. olanzapine levels at this low dose were in the range of  <dig> ng/ml and  <dig> ng/ml. when inter-group comparisons of drug plasma concentrations were made between fluoxetine  in combination with olanzapine at either the  <dig> mg/kg or the  <dig>  mg/kg dose range, differences in mean values of the two groups did not vary enough  to reject the possibility of random sampling variability. a similar statistical trend was observed for norfluoxetine levels after  <dig> consecutive days of drug treatment; there was not a statistically significant difference  between the two groups. however, differences in the median values between  <dig> mg/kg and  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine doses were greater than would be expected by chance . as expected, rats injected ip with cyclodextrin showed no traces of either fluoxetine or olanzapine levels in plasma . in general, our gc-ms measurements detect pharmacological and relevant levels of both fluoxetine and olanzapine in rats, a finding consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

the fact that regardless of olanzapine dosing both rat groups lost equal amounts of body weight is indicative that these two phenomena  may not be causally related. no discernible changes in brain structure or integrity were found, as assessed by nissl staining and stereological cell counts conducted within the rat hypothalamus . values are means ± sem. n =  <dig> per dosing group. * p ≤  <dig>  when compared with appropriate olanzapine dose.

discussion
the present study shows that  <dig> days of concomitant fluoxetine and olanzapine treatment leads to a significant decrease of weight gain in rats. given that the above drug combination is particularly effective in treatment-resistant depression, our findings are of interest for revealing potential liabilities associated with its therapeutic use. here, our data suggest a possible pharmacodynamic event-related effect regarding the action of two psychoactive drugs over time. indeed, there is a well-established relationship between clinically effective drugs, appetite control and weight changes across diverse patient populations  <cit> . for instance, weight gain appears to be correlated positively with clinical responses to anti-psychotic medication  <cit> . the combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine in our studies produced weight loss irrespective of anti-psychotic drug dosing. that is, fluoxetine at a fixed dose of  <dig> mg/kg administered concomitantly with either  <dig> mg/kg or  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine yielded an approximately 20% mean reduction in body weight for both doses. therefore, body weight changes associated with the above drug combination are more likely due to the effects of olanzapine or its metabolic pathways . indeed, this hypothesis is further supported by the fact that although rats treated with  <dig> mg/kg olanzapine were eating and drinking less than animals injected with a smaller dose , body weight outcome was nevertheless similar for all drug-treated rats. in this regard, it is conceivable that the suppressed consumption of food and water observed in animals injected ip with  <dig> mg/kg olanzapine might have been the result of malaise, or at least the result of aversion to the hedonic aspects of food and water. however this possibility does not explain, in general, the sustained and consistent decrease in weight gain for all rats treated with fluoxetine and olanzapine. changes in glucose metabolism were also ruled out as a causal role for the reduction in weight gain and food intake as both vehicle-and drug-treated animals showed undistinguishable serum glucose levels during fasting. further studies of these questions will yield insight into centrally acting peptides and/or peripherally acting thermogenic mechanisms underlying decreases in weight gain in adult rats.

placing our results in the framework of clinical situations, decreases in rat weight gain as a result of fluoxetine and olanzapine treatment do not mirror the profile occurring across diverse patient populations. there is evidence that long-term fluoxetine plus olanzapine treatment frequently leads to weight gain in individuals with major depressive disorders with and without treatment-resistant depression  <cit> . further, high doses of fluoxetine do not appear to counteract the weight gain often induced by atypical anti-psychotics such as olanzapine  <cit> . the stark disparity between rat and human studies regarding body weight dynamics raises the possibility of mismatched models for revealing certain liabilities associated with fluoxetine and olanzapine therapy in mood disorders. it is conceivable, for instance, that rats might be more sensitive to the anorectic effects of fluoxetine than humans. fluoxetine is known to produce anorectic effects that often lead to a decrease in weight gain; a phenomenon observed equally at the experimental and clinical level  <cit> . alternatively, olanzapine metabolism may differ significantly in rats as indirectly suggested by previous reports  <cit> . in this context, olanzapine is metabolized to its 10- and 4'-n-glucuronides, with the 10-n-glucuronide being the most abundant metabolite in humans  <cit> . as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of olanzapine in rats is relatively obscure  <cit> , it is possible that changes in glucuronidation metabolism in rodents may have impacted the ability of the parent drug to influence heterogeneous population of cells associated with body weight dynamics. from these statements, one might conclude that our findings are not clinically significant and perhaps of limited value for additional investigation. although the animal data indeed do not support the clinical situation, the above findings could harbor important information as to how species-specific differences limit drug-drug interactions or body weigh regulation, lessons that could influence subsequent studies regarding fluoxetine and olanzapine therapy in more defined experimental settings.

in the present study, measurements of fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and olanzapine plasma concentrations were made to assess their pharmacology after  <dig> days of combined drug exposure. in general, drug plasma levels fell within the expected therapeutic range typically observed in psychiatric patients. for instance, after  <dig> days of dosing at  <dig> mg/day, plasma levels of fluoxetine are in the range of 90– <dig> ng/ml across diverse patient populations  <cit> . in our animal studies, at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg , mean plasma concentrations achieved were in the range of 300– <dig> ng/ml after  <dig> days of combined drug treatment. oral doses of olanzapine at  <dig> mg/day often yield plasma levels of 20– <dig> ng/ml in healthy volunteers and in patients with schizophrenia  <cit> . concentrations ≥ <dig> ng/ml are considered threshold for the occurrence of adverse effects. in our present study, at a dose of  <dig> mg/kg olanzapine, mean plasma levels achieved of the anti-psychotic drug were ~ <dig> ng/ml. the relatively high levels of olanzapine may help explain in part the hypophagic and adipsic phenomena experienced by rats at this particular dosing. interpreted in this way, olanzapine concentrations ≥ <dig> ng/ml  reached a threshold for the onset of malaise or taste aversion effects. in contrast, animals exposed to a  <dig>  mg/kg olanzapine dose showed optimal therapeutic range of olanzapine plasma levels  and normal feeding and drinking behaviors. it should be noted that the dosing paradigm implemented in our current studies yielded fluoxetine, norfluoxetine and olanzapine plasma concentrations similar to those reported by zhang et al  <cit>  under an acute experimental design. therefore it is possible that little or no significant metabolic interactions between fluoxetine and olanzapine combination treatment occurs in rats as a function of chronic drug exposure. this possibility has merit as no clinically significant metabolic interactions are also reported during combined fluoxetine and olanzapine therapy  <cit> . placing the current data in the framework of the growing body of experimental and clinical evidence, it is unlikely that drug-drug interactions modify the pharmacological profile of fluoxetine and olanzapine when the two psychoactive agents are administered concomitantly to experimental animal models.

CONCLUSIONS
combination therapies of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs are increasingly used for treatment-resistant mood disorders. here, we have provided further evidence that fluoxetine and olanzapine have pharmacodynamic event-related effects on body weight dynamics  <cit> . in rats, these effects are manifested in the form of anorexia or perhaps anhedonia to food and water. of interest, anorectic phenomena are also observed in rats chronically treated with valproic acid and lithium  <cit> ; both valproic acid and lithium are widely touted as effective prophylactic agents for manic-depressive illness  <cit> . it is quite probable therefore that augmentation therapy of several mood stabilizers is associated with weight loss in rats, whereas the same combination drug pattern results in weight gain in special patient populations. this disparity adds a new level of complexity to the issue of body weight changes associated with psychopharmacology  <cit> , and indicates species-specific variations in this phenomenon. in our particular case, adjusting olanzapine dosing to rat studies from  <dig> mg/kg to  <dig>  mg/kg should preclude malaise bouts and/or taste aversion effects. in addition, the above dosage modification should be considered for achieving clinically therapeutic anti-psychotic plasma levels. if such a dosing paradigm is overlooked, it may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding mechanisms of medication action and side effect profile during drug augmentation therapy.
