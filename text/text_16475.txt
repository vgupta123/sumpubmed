BACKGROUND
cellulose is the most abundant organic compound and renewable carbon resource on earth  <cit> . biodegradation of cellulose, an abundant plant polysaccharide, is a complex process that requires the coordinate action of three enzymes, among which endoglucanases , are able to break the internal bonds of cellulose, and disrupt its crystalline structure, exposing the individual cellulose polysaccharide chains, playing in most important role  <cit> . the degradation is mainly carried out by bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, commensals in the guts of herbivorous animals, as well as the termite reticulitermes speratus <cit> , from which, there are variety of endoglucanases. the complex chemical nature and heterogeneity of cellulose account for the multiplicity of endoglucanases produced by microorganisms. the activity of different endoglucanases with subtle differences in substrate specificity and mode of action contributes to improvement of the degradation of plant cellulose in natural habitats. there are fourteen families of glycoside hydrolases  that are used for cellulose hydrolysis  <cit> . more and more extremophiles have been studied in recent years, especially the hyperthermophilic enzymes. based on amino acid sequence homologies and hydrophobic cluster analysis, hyperthermophilic endoglucanases obtained from extremophiles, which are widely distributed in terrestrial and marine hydrothermal areas, as well as in deep subsurface oil reservoirs, have been classified into ghf <dig>  <cit> . as described above, there are hyperthermophilic endoglucanases from archaea, most of which were chosen for sequencing on the basis of their physiology  <cit> . in addition, many hyperthermophilic endoglucanases gene which have been cloned were found in some heat-tolerant bacteria  <cit> . those hyperthermophilic endoglucanases have a common feature that the amino acid sequences are mostly relatively short .

although many hyperthermophilic endoglucanases of ghf <dig> amino acids have been reported from archaea and bacteria, a complete survey and classification of all sequences in these species from disparate evolutionary groups, and the relationship between their molecular structures and functions are lacking. the completion of several high-quality gene or genome sequencing projects provided us with the unique opportunity to make an unprecedented assessment and thorough comparative analysis of the hyperthermophilic endoglucanases encoded in archaea and bacteria. the analysis of the full set of hyperthermophilic endoglucanases genes in genomes from diverse species allows a definitive classification of hyperthermophilic endoglucanases and an assessment of their origins, evolutionary relations, patterns of differentiation, and proliferation in the various phylogenetic groups. we are interested in finding answers to the following questions: 1) what are the evolutionary relations among these hyperthermophilic endoglucanases?; 2) what is the common feature between these conserved amino acid residues and 3d topological structure?; 3) what the mechanism of the heat tolerance among these hyperthermophilic endoglucanases?

the broad analysis in this study provided a comprehensive classification scheme and proposed a molecular structure applicable to all hyperthermophilic endoglucanases. a clear picture of the patterns of endoglucanases classes in different species groups was provided. we identified and classified in this study a higher number of hyperthermophilic endoglucanase amino acids from the ghf <dig> than previously reported, allowing us to identify their relationships based on the phylogenetic clustering. we found that, similar to archaea, amino acids from hyperthermophilic bacteria are also quite different from the other sequences in ghf <dig>  we characterized several conserved amino acid sites from these endoglucanases and predicted their functionality based on the amino acids similarity among the proteins available in databases. the resulting rich data set of hyperthermophilic endoglucanases from ghf <dig>  comprising  <dig> sequences, is available downloaded from ncbi .

RESULTS
protein sequences characteristics
genbank has grown fast in recent years and offer us with much better taxonomic sampling for such blast-based analysis  <cit> . we performed similar blast-based analysis for the  <dig> thermophilic endoglucanase protein sequences , using the nonredundant  database as a reference and recording highest ranking matches. we also searched endoglucanase sequences in several plants, bacteria, fungi and algae sequences including the sequences of the r. speratus, using the protein blast search engine with a variety of endoglucanase amino acid sequences as queries for most of the thermophilic endoglucanase, else using endoglucanase as a keyword for searching other amino acid sequences of endoglucanase . in most cases, whenever significant similarity to an endoglucanase sequence was identified, the amino acid sequence was excised and homology based protein predictions were performed using the most similar query as a guide. all of these  <dig> protein sequences range from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues in length. of these sequences, those from archaea and bacteria showed similar lengths, especially for those  <dig> thermophilic endoglucanase protein sequences where the average percentage composition of the residues cysteine and histidine is only  <dig>  and  <dig> , which are less frequent in thermophilic proteins according to the statistics of amino acid composition based on mega  <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic analysis based on the maximum-parsimony  and neighbour-joining  procedure implemented in paup  <dig>   <cit>  and other approaches , indicated that all endoglucanase proteins can be reliably grouped into  <dig> distinct classes except for the outgroup r. speratus, which belongs to the insect family . furthermore, from the multiple sequence alignments, the hyperthermophilic endoglucanase proteins belong to the class i, and others belong to class ii and iii. no obvious differentiations are implied in these  <dig> protein sequences. it was not surprising that there was a close relationship among  <dig> protein sequences from bacteria and archaea supported with good bootstrap values based on maximum-likelihood  tree by using mega  <dig> . it was inferred that the endoglucanases of dictyoglomus turgidum, thermotoga naphthophila and thermotoga maritima which are currently studied in our research group are closely related compared to the others, although the identity of the amino acid sequences were shown less than 30% . therefore, it was postulated that they may have a common origination based on protein evolution. class ii comprises of other  <dig> proteins from plant, fungi and bacteria, and class iii comprises of  <dig> proteins from bacteria.

analysis of conserved and catalytic amino acid residues
for the further analysis of the relationship among  <dig> hyperthermophilic endoglucanases from bacteria and archaea, those  <dig> amino acid sequences were aligned again with clustal x <dig> . we found that the conserved amino acids of hyperthermophilic endoglucanase in cel12b  include gly <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig>  trp <dig>  glu <dig>  met <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig>  gly <dig> and glu <dig> which are highlighted in red , which is very different from the previously reported data  <cit> . among these conserved amino acids, two glutamic acid residues might be the catalytic nucleophile and proton donor like lysozyme with acid base catalysis  <cit> , other eight conserved amino acids might be necessary to the thermostability of protein and binding of the substrate.

hyperthermophilic protein homology modeling
all the hyperthermophilic protein sequences were rendered using swiss-model database for protein modeling, but only one good model, cel12b protein model from t. maritima, can be used to describe conserved amino acids in which sites of secondary structure and enzymatic center of protein. as described with cel12b protein model, glu <dig>  glu <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig> and met <dig> residues, comprised the active center of the protein . cel12b protein is primarily composed of β-sheet . trp <dig>  glu <dig>  met <dig>  trp <dig> and gly <dig> residues are in the β-sheet; pro <dig> and trp <dig> residues are in the turn; and gly <dig>  pro <dig> and glu <dig> residues are in the random coil .

analysis of site-directed mutagenesis
base on the homology modeling, the functional amino acid residues glu <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig> and met <dig> of cel12b were selected to be mutated. the results showed that the p63k, p83k, m133w, e64h, e64t and e64l mutant enzymes dramaticlly inhibited the enzyme activity of cel12b toward cmc-na, while e64s mutant protein apparently increased the enzyme activity .

discussion
endoglucanases isolated from hyperthermophilic organisms are more active and stable at higher temperatures than their counterparts from mesophiles. in addition, they may be more appropriate for degradation of the cellulose. since the enzyme activity of those hyperthermophilic endoglucanases is not high for degradation, the hyperthermophilic modification by using genetic engineering is essential. few structures on databases have been reported so far for transforming those enzymes. in this paper, nineteen sequences of hyperthermophilic endoglucanases were aligned and used for phylogenetic tree construction and molecular modeling to illustrate the relationship between structure and themostability.

the features of the nature environment of ancestral organism can be inferred by reconstructing phylogenetic tree using amino acid sequences of these organisms  <cit> . from the alignment of the amino acids sequences, the hyperthermophilic proteins from bacteria and archaea are clustered together based on the phylogenetic tree . archaea, known to be an ancient organisms on earth, grow in strictly anaerobic environment  at high temperature , and hyperthermophilic bacteria also live in the same conditions  <cit> . therefore, it is inferred that endoglucanases from hyperthermophilic microorganisms from ghf <dig> could share the similar enzymatic properties and catalytic mechanism.

the stability of thermophilic proteins depend on several amino acid residues and structural factors  <cit> . specific amino acid composition plays a critical role in the thermostability of hyperthermophilic endoglucanase, with the fewest cysteine and histidine residues that are thermal stability among the whole protein sequences by using statistical comparison of the amino acid composition  <cit> , consistent with this feature, the average content of cysteine and histidine in our reserach is only  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively .

ten conserved amino acids were found by the alignment of nineteen hyperthermophilic protein sequences , that we hypothesize may play a significant role in proton donation, substrate binding as well as the high thermostability. among these nineteen amino acid sequences, only thethree-dimensional structure of endoglucanase from t. maritima could be obtained , since there is no suitable template for other proteins homologous modeling. thus, the relationship between the ten amino acid residues of these endoglucanases and their molecular structures will be illustrated in cel12b protein from t. maritima. the substitution of non-gly residue with gly residue can be used as one of the general strategies to enhance the protein stability  <cit> . in our study, residues gly <dig> and gly <dig> located in random coil and β-sheet, respectively, might contribute to the thermostability of the protein .

it is believed that loop and turn are the weak connections among the protein secondary structure elements, but recently it was demonstrated that they played a key role in thermostability of protein, especially for the proteins that proline is located in loop or turn region  <cit> . proline in the polypeptide chain possesses less conformational freedom than other amino acids, as the pyrrolidine ring of proline imposes rigid constrains on the n-c rotation and restricts the available conformational space of the preceding residue. therefore it can bend the polypeptide chain on itself so as to prepare the backbone much more easily to form the hydrogen bonds with the polar side chains of other turns; meanwhile, the hydrophobic part of proline can interact with the adjacent hydrophobic cavity  <cit> . compared to mesophilic proteins, thermophilic proteins contain more proline residues especially occurring at the turn, with higher frequency, as well as the shorter loop region of the glucosidase. as the consequence of the flexibility reduction of the polypeptide chain, the protein thermostability can be increased by introducing prolines at specific sites based on the facts that illustrated above  <cit> . hence, residues pro <dig> and pro <dig>  located in the turn and random coil respectively , could provide closer packing of each region, as assumed for thermostability of protein. and then, it was finally confirmed by experimental results. compared to other amino acids, lysine has longer side-chain groups and more vibrational degree of freedom, and it is more sensitive to the temperature. when the proline is substituted with lysine, the vibration of side-chain groups rises up at high temperature, and then the thermostability of the cel12b decrease dramatically. therefore, it is confirmed that residues pro <dig> and pro <dig> play an important role in stabilizing the cel12b.

the crystal structure and protein molecular simulation supported that two glutamic acid residues are the catalytic nucleophile and proton donor that have been reported in many enzymes, lysozyme, xylanase as well as endoglucanase  <cit> . so, glu <dig>  and glu <dig>  residues are the proton donor and catalytic nucleophile repectively . although the chemical nature of the tryptophan residue in the catalytic center does not significantly affect the conformational properties of lysozyme, it exhibited a pronounced effect on the binding of substrate and the enhancement of the total enzyme activity  <cit> . it was reported that structural changes at the active site  of alcohol dehydrogenase from sulfolobus solfataricus are consistent with the reduced activity on substrates and decreased coenzyme binding  <cit> . therefore, we propose that three tryptophan residues  of cel12b protein may be essential in mediating the total cooperativity of the response of the enzyme to substrate. met <dig>  located in the middle of trp <dig> and glu <dig> in β-sheet , is predicted to be related to the binding of substrate and also finally confirmed by experimental results. when it is replaced by tryptophan residue, the enzyme activity is significantly decreased. with the homology modeling result , it is inferred that glu <dig> is probably another functional acid amino located near the catalytic center. it is supposed that residue glu <dig> might contribute to stabilizing the intermediate product. maintaining the intermediate product may be caused by the interaction of side-chain group of glu <dig>  polar amino acids, histidine and threonine are able to stabilize the intermediate product to some extent. however, their side-chain groups are relatively large, and possess larger steric hindrance, thus lead to decrease of the enzyme activity. compared to glutamic acid, histidine and threonine, serine has smaller side-chain group and steric hindrance, so it can easily form hydrogen bond with product and stabilize it, and then increase the enzyme activity.

CONCLUSIONS
nineteen hyperthermophilic homologous protein sequences from ghf <dig> were aligned and used for constructing phylogenetic tree. it was inferred from the nodes that there is a close relationship among these nineteen homologous endoglucanases from hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea. we have made clear the function of these conserved amino acids in cel12b protein, which is helpful in analyzing other molecular structure and transforming them with site directed mutagenesis.
