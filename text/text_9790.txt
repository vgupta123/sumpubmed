BACKGROUND
female multiple mating is prevalent in nature, even when males provide no material benefits such as food or parental care to females  <cit> . female multiple mating in such circumstances is unexpected because mating carries associated costs. aside from the energy and time required to engage in mating  <cit> , multiply mated females may significantly increase their risk of predation or disease transmission  <cit> . understanding why female multiple mating is the rule rather than the exception in the absence of material benefits remains a key challenge in evolutionary ecology  <cit> .

the adaptive significance of multiple mating has been extensively debated and the general idea is that, to be adaptive, the costs of multiple mating must be offset by benefits that enhance female fitness. two types of benefits are commonly used to explain the adaptive value of multiple mating: non-genetic benefits   <cit>  and genetic benefits   <cit> . direct benefits derive from the quality of the sperm of certain males that may increase female fecundity, longevity, or mating rate  <cit> . additionally, if males transfer insufficient sperm, females may mate multiply to ensure all eggs are fertilized, hence obtaining fecundity benefits  <cit> . indirect benefits, on the other hand, are next generation benefits that are associated with post copulatory sexual selection mechanisms that are promoted by mating with multiple, genetically variable, males   <cit> . post copulatory sexual selection can select for compatible genes  <cit> , thus reducing inbreeding depression  <cit>  and leading to the production of offspring of higher quality  <cit> . alternatively, post mating sexual selection may also favour males with competitive ejaculates to sire more competitive offspring  <cit> .

although, direct benefits play a crucial role in the adaptiveness of female multiple mating  <cit> , over the last decade there has been an increasing amount of theoretical and empirical evidence in support of the adaptive value of multiple mating based on indirect benefits  <cit> . examples of indirect benefits include, increased offspring attractiveness and viability  <cit> , genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity  <cit> . indirect benefits have been proposed to be sufficient to maintain multiple mating even at the expense of direct costs to females, such as reduced longevity  <cit> , if the immediate direct costs are outweighed by a sufficiently large increase in indirect fitness benefits, .

despite evidence that females gain indirect benefits  from multiple mating, two difficulties are often identified. first, it is difficult to disentangle direct and indirect benefits. the mechanism by which females obtain direct benefits, such as increased fecundity, may also affect offspring viability, thereby obscuring any evidence of indirect benefits  <cit> . second, indirect benefits assume that f <dig> offspring fitness is elevated  <cit> . however, to date, most tests of indirect benefits have focused on offspring traits in the first generation , rather than on the relationship between multiple mating and an increase in the numerical representation in future generations  . such demonstration is vital to confirm the underlying assumption that indirect benefits result in an increase in f <dig> offspring fitness  <cit> .

in order to circumvent these difficulties, a stronger test of the adaptiveness of multiple mating would be one that: 1) tracks the fate of offspring across two generations  <cit> , and 2) teases apart first-generation and second-generation fitness benefits. the number of grand-offspring reaching reproductive maturity is a robust measure of fitness  <cit> . to partition the first and second generation contributions by this predicted benefit of multiple mating, we need to know the extent to which the production of grand-offspring is attributable to an increase in the numbers of offspring produced and the extent to which it results from improved offspring fitness .

quantifying the benefits of multiple mating solely on the basis of the number of offspring produced, however, may produce biased estimates of fitness. fitness is a function of the number of viable descendants produced, as well as the influence that other life history traits have on the performance of offspring in particular contexts, or at a given point in the life cycle  <cit> . if, for example, offspring from multiply mated females are larger at birth or grow faster  than offspring from singly mated mothers, then multiply mated females could attain greater fitness benefits for the same number of offspring produced. consequently, fitness should be complemented with information on survival and how this is affected by other life history traits known a priori to be correlated with fitness  <cit> .

here, we test the hypothesis that multiple mating results in increased f <dig> fitness, by examining the number of ‘grand-offspring’ produced. we develop and apply a multi-generational test that allows us to disentangle the contributions of first generation  and second-generation  effects of this outcome. specifically, using the trinidadian guppy , we conduct a two-generation experiment to assess the net fitness of sons and daughters produced by contrasting mating  treatments. guppies have a promiscuous non-resource-based mating system, in which female multiple mating is extremely common  <cit> , with the highest total number of putative sires per brood recorded for a vertebrate species  <cit> . while male sexual harassment is important in the cost-benefit trade-off of female mating decisions  <cit> , numerous studies have shown that, under some circumstances, females promote multiple matings  <cit> . this suggests that multiple mating cannot be exclusively attributed to a “convenience strategy” where females approach males to minimize costs associated with sexual harassment from other males  <cit> . two other conditions may justify the adaptive value of multiple mating in the absence of material benefits: increasing female fecundity  and/or increasing offspring reproductive success   <cit> . given the ubiquity of female multiple mating in guppies, and coupled with the absence of any resource-based/material benefits from males to females, we predict that under identical social and environmental conditions, multiply mated females will produce more grand-offspring than singly mated ones.

we first tested the prediction that multiple mated females obtain indirect benefits by producing more grand-offspring . we did this by comparing the number of f2s generated via single and multiple mated f <dig> treatments. we then examined how mating success and brood size of f <dig> females and f <dig> offspring contributed to this effect. first, the number of f1s produced was compared between the two mating treatments. second, we tested whether the f <dig> offspring of multiply mated females were more viable than those of singly-mated females, when all f1s were paired with randomly selected mates under a common garden experimental design. this allowed us to attribute any overall differences in the number of grand-offspring produced to; having more f <dig> offspring, to having f <dig> offspring that were more viable, or to a combination of both. in addition, to assess the extent to which these fitness measures may be biased by differences in offspring characteristics, we measured size at birth and growth rates, which have been previously described as important fitness correlates. differences between the offspring of single and multiple mated females in these quantities could, in nature, offset differences in the number of f <dig> or f <dig> offspring produced.

RESULTS
f <dig> to f2
the estimated probability of breeding success for f <dig> females  was higher for multiple  than for single  matings, but the difference was not statistically significant  . however, once the number of viable grand-offspring produced  was taken into account, multiply mated f <dig> females produced, on average, 67% more viable grand-offspring  than singly mated f <dig> females . separate analysis of grand-offspring produced via female and viable male f <dig> individuals indicated that this was principally due to the fact that multiple matings produced more than twice as many grand-offspring as single matings, on average, via viable male f <dig> , a highly significant difference . in contrast, the grand-offspring produced via female f <dig> did not differ significantly with mating treatment . note that the mean number of f2s descended via a singly or multiply mated grandmother through a son or daughter f <dig> was calculated using only viable f1s.

sample size , mean and standard error of the mean for single and multiple mating treatments at f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  for each component of fitness. mean brood size for f <dig> was calculated using only viable f1s . breeding success in brackets is the fitted probability of producing a brood, based on a negative binomial distribution for f <dig> and a binomial probability distribution for f <dig>  the means and standard error of means for breeding success were calculated using these two probability distributions. for all other variables arithmetic means are presented. growth rate was calculated as the rate of weekly growth  over 12 weeks. maturation is the number of days from birth until sexual maturation. mortality is the number of individuals that died per mating treatment before producing a first brood.

f <dig> to f1
multiply mated females produced 60% more viable f <dig> offspring, on average, than singly mated females . the greater fecundity observed was driven by the production of 83% more viable males , whereas viable female offspring did not differ significantly between treatments . sex ratio  of f1s was not significantly different from a 1: <dig> in the single mating treatment , but was male-biased in the multiple mating treatment .

f <dig> to f2
in the next generation, there were no significant differences in the reproductive success of individual f <dig> that had been produced from multiple versus single matings , regardless of whether the f1s were male  or female . in terms of sex ratios in the grand-offspring , both treatments had even sex ratios that did not differ significantly from 1: <dig> .

effect of multiple mating on size at birth, growth rate, time to sexual maturation and survival
model selection revealed that for all traits, the estimated best model included a random effect due to tank of origin , but no consistent difference between females in different treatments. there was also some support for a mixed effect model, which included treatment and tank . finally, in terms of survival,  <dig> % of f1s from singly mated and 98% of f1s from multiply mated females survived up to 12 weeks. for f2s, 98% and  <dig> % of grand-offspring, of singly and multiply mated origins respectively, survived until 12 weeks . there was therefore no significant effect of multiple mating on f <dig> and f <dig> survival.

discussion
despite growing evidence that females obtain reproductive benefits from mating multiply, the extent to which these benefits are partitioned between first- and second-generations remains controversial  <cit> . this partitioning is critical to validate the assumption that multiple mating confers genetic benefits that increase offspring net fitness . by comparing fitness gains, using multiple components of fitness, between singly and multiply mated females over two generations, we have addressed this question.

our results strongly support the hypothesis that multiple mating is adaptive, as manifested in an increase in female fecundity. we found that multiply mated females produce substantially more grand-offspring than singly mated females. however, because the reproductive output  of progeny from multiply and singly mated females was not significantly different, we also showed that this fitness advantage is driven by the production of more offspring in the first generation , rather than by elevating the fitness of offspring .

our results do not preclude the possibility that selection for indirect benefits exists, because direct and indirect benefits may operate simultaneously  <cit> . previous work has found the offspring of multiply mated female to be larger at birth, phenotypically more diverse, and have enhanced schooling and predator avoidance skills  <cit> . such traits are likely to be important in the natural environment in enabling progeny to survive until they are able to reproduce. for example, there is evidence that environmental factors such as disease play a role in female indirect selection for males with pathogen resistance alleles  <cit> . a similar process could operate in naturally occurring guppy populations. thus, while indirect benefits may operate under different environmental circumstances that were not investigated here, our study provides clear evidence that multiple mating benefits females, and that the direct effect of an increase in fecundity plays a key role in delivering this benefit. importantly, mating treatment had no effect in terms of terms of size at birth, growth rate or viability, underscoring the importance of the scale of fecundity fitness benefits from multiple mating.

fitness can be defined as a measure of the proportion of individuals that are propagated into the following generations  <cit> . a limitation of our study was that net fitness  was only recorded for the first brood. nevertheless, we do not believe that this materially undermines our conclusions. specifically, in contrast to individuals exposed to natural variation , all the individuals of f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig> generations in our experiment were allocated to identical conditions of light, temperature, food provisioning, and sexual harassment. under such stable and identical conditions, temporal variation in fitness is likely to be small  <cit> . also, by recording fitness on a large number of tanks per mating treatment across two generations, we reduced the risk of getting a biased estimate of fitness  <cit> .

it is possible that singly mated f <dig> females produced fewer f1s as result of brood retention, but we think this possibility is unlikely. one advantage of multiple mating over single mating is that it enables mechanisms of post-copulatory sexual selection to operate to maximize fitness  <cit> . if f <dig> females in the singly mated treatment retained brood production, then this can be seen as an advantage of multiple mating over single mating. it is, however, important to point out that there were no differences in the probability of producing a first brood or in the time of gestation between singly and multiply mated f <dig> females . these two variables are good indicators of female stress. additionally, guppies lack superfetation, meaning that all embryos are at the same developmental stage  <cit> . it is therefore unlikely that brood retention could explain our results.

when the environment is controlled, as it was in this experiment, it is the increased quantity of f <dig> offspring, rather than the quality of those offspring, that is the key determinant of fitness. previous work found the offspring of multiply mated female to be larger at birth, and phenotypically more diverse, and to have enhanced schooling, and predator avoidance skills  <cit> . size at birth and growth rate are strongly maternally influenced  <cit> , and have been shown to be important fitness correlates in guppies  <cit> . although phenotypic diversity and offspring behavior were not measured, we found no effect of multiple mating on size at birth, growth rate, time to sexual maturity, or survival. in this, our results are consistent with a recent meta-analysis, which showed that female multiple mating does not have a significant impact on such offspring demographic traits  <cit> . the identical conditions across mating treatments and generations could have minimized selection for the traits analyzed in our study.

similar increases in fecundity associated with multiple mating have been reported across different taxa  <cit> . theoretical models predict that if direct benefits outweigh the costs associated with multiple mating, there will be enough selective pressure to maintain multiple mating based on direct reproductive benefits without the need for second generation fitness benefits  <cit> . in species with internal copulation, a major survival cost associated with multiple mating is the physical injury and disease transmission caused by the male’s sexual organ. since the frequency of multiple mating is similar in laboratory and wild conditions  <cit> , the above costs are therefore predicted to be comparable . multiple mating had no effect on survival or on the probability of producing a first brood in f <dig> females. mating treatment also did not affect the number of f1s that reach sexual maturity, hence it is unlikely to have caused any difference in fitness. although we cannot rule out the effect of “ideal laboratory conditions” in alleviating the costs associated with multiple mating, the fact that we did not find any effect of multiple mating in costs that are measurable under laboratory conditions and in any of the life history traits studied indicates the costs were negligible in the multiple mating treatment.

the greater fecundity in the multiple mating treatment was driven by the over-production of viable sons . likewise, multiply mated females of house wren produce a surplus of male offspring  <cit> . while theoretical models predict that female multiple mating can affect the dynamics of sex ratio  <cit> , empirical studies documenting such effects are rare  <cit> . here, we empirically show for the first time, that female multiple mating influences the offspring sex-ratio in the trinidadian guppy. sex ratios are usually female biased in laboratory guppy strains  <cit> , which is in stark contrast to our results. variation in environmental/social conditions affects sex ratios  <cit> . as water temperature, feeding and level of sexual harassment were identical between mating treatments, so a sex ratio adjustment in response to differences in environmental conditions seems unlikely. evolutionary theory predicts that when conditions are good, females should invest more in the sex with greater reproductive variability  <cit> , which in our case is expected to be the male sex. multiple mating and female harassment by males is the norm among guppy populations, whereas single mating is the unnatural condition. is it possible that this created stress that led singly mated females to produce fewer sons? future studies should investigate the causes of this over production of sons from multiply mated females and ask whether this is adaptive in the long run.

one possible mechanism for the over-production of sons is the existence of segregation distortion genes or sex ratio meiotic drive. during spermatogenesis, the sex ratio distortion gene links to one of the sex chromosomes and prevents the production of functional gametes bearing the other sex chromosomes  <cit> . sex ratio segregation distortion genes have been reported for many fish species, including guppies  <cit> . however, these genes act during spermatogenesis, which occurred before the start of the experiment, as it typically takes 36 days in guppies  <cit> . hence it is unclear how segregation distortion genes could have differentially affected the two treatments unless they influence the outcome of sperm competition. in fact, in fruit flies, sperm bearing sex ratio distorting genes have reduced competitive ability, giving them a reduced share of paternity under contexts of sperm competition, such as those created by multiple mating  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
for most of the twentieth century, studies of sexual selection assumed that female fitness can be maximized by mating with a single male  <cit> . as a result, multiple mating by females was mostly seen as a consequence of sexual conflict and sexual coercion by males  <cit> . more recently there has been a shift in this perspective, with the female’s role in multiple mating increasingly recognized  <cit> . our study reinforces this idea and adds to the growing evidence that the benefits gained by females from multiple mating in most cases outweigh the costs. as our study shows, under benign conditions, multiple mating brings a ~ <dig>  fold increase in female fecundity. this increase in fecundity, which occurs at an apparently negligible physical cost for both the mother and offspring, is a strong indicator of the adaptiveness of female multiple mating. sexual conflict arises when the reproductive agendas of each sex are different  <cit> . however if multiple mating is advantageous for females, as is increasingly recognized across many taxa, then it is time to examine mating decisions from the perspective that both female and male fitness can be maximized by mating multiply. this does not mean that sexual conflict is irrelevant, but it shows that the effects of female multiple mating on fitness must also always be considered.
