BACKGROUND
the pancreas is composed of an exocrine compartment with acinar and ductal cells, which secrete and transport digestive enzymes into the gut, and an endocrine compartment, which regulates glucose homeostasis by secreting pancreatic hormones into the bloodstream. loss of pancreatic insulin-producing cells  is a hallmark of diabetes. an attractive therapeutic approach to cure this disease is to stimulate beta cell regeneration in vivo from another pancreatic cell type or from progenitors. however, the regenerative capacity of beta cells is very limited in mammals and the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved need to be well understood before we will be able to stimulate this process. the zebrafish , owing to its phenomenal capacity to restore beta cells after targeted cell ablation , has become an attractive model organism for the study of the regeneration process. to this end, tools need to be developed, especially to define the source of the new beta cells. so far, no zebrafish transgenic lines have been available to allow a lineage tracing of either multipotent pancreatic progenitors, giving rise to both exocrine and endocrine tissues, or pancreatic endocrine precursor cells.

the pancreas develops from two domains, called the dorsal bud and the ventral bud, which emerge from the foregut endoderm  <cit> . in zebrafish, the dorsal bud generates the first wave of endocrine cells, which cluster at  <dig> hours post fertilization  to form the principal islet  <cit> . the ventral bud emerges anteriorly to the dorsal bud at  <dig> hpf and gives rise to acinar, ductal, and to a second wave of endocrine cells  <cit> . these late endocrine cells originate either from the extra-pancreatic ducts  and contribute to the expansion of the principal islet  or from the intra-pancreatic ducts  and form small secondary islets all along them. these ipds contain pancreatic notch-responsive cells , which represent a population of progenitors of endocrine cells and ductal cells but not of acinar cells  <cit> .

notch signaling pathway controls the differentiation of pancreatic cells both in zebrafish and mice . one of its functions is to maintain a pool of progenitors in an undifferentiated state through the repression of genes of the achaete scute-like  family or of the atonal-related protein  family. in the murine pancreas, notch signaling prevents endocrine cell differentiation through the repression of neurog <dig>  <cit> . in zebrafish, neurog <dig> is not expressed in the pancreas and therefore the control of endocrine cell fate is fulfilled by other ascl/arp factors, namely ascl1b and neurod <dig>  which are both repressed by notch signaling  <cit> . exactly like the inactivation of murine neurog <dig>  their simultaneous inactivation completely prevents endocrine cell differentiation leading to the loss of all hormone-secreting cells  <cit> . ascl1b is the earliest pancreatic marker identified during zebrafish development, its expression starting at the end of gastrulation in the prospective pancreatic region . ascl1b is transiently expressed during the formation of the dorsal bud  and, like murine neurog <dig>  is not detected in hormone-expressing cells. later, in the ventral bud, ascl1b expression is turned on when the endocrine cell differentiation program is induced through the blocking of notch signaling  <cit> . this notch inactivation triggers a massive expression of ascl1b in ipds  <cit> . these data suggest that ascl1b expression is restricted to the committed endocrine precursors. however, the observation that the onset of ascl1b expression in the prospective pancreatic region precedes all other known pancreatic progenitor markers raises the possibility of the multipotency of the first ascl1b+ cells.

another key factor for pancreatic development is the homeobox transcription factor nkx <dig> . in the mouse, it is expressed in the multipotent progenitors during early pancreatic development  <cit> , and, in the zebrafish, nkx <dig>  is expressed early in the pancreatic primordium of the dorsal bud   <cit> . at later developmental stages in the mouse embryo, nkx <dig>  becomes restricted to the endocrine/duct bipotential trunk domain  <cit> . similarly, nkx <dig>  is first broadly expressed in the zebrafish pancreatic ventral bud primordium  <cit> , then segregates from the ptf1a+ acinar cells to persist in the primitive ducts  that will give rise to the mature ducts and to secondary islets  <cit> . in the mouse, nkx <dig>  is expressed in the differentiated beta cells  <cit>  while in the zebrafish, nkx <dig>  is never expressed in beta cells nor in the other pancreatic hormone-expressing cells  <cit> . these data suggest that in zebrafish nkx <dig>  also marks multipotent pancreatic progenitors. however, previous findings suggested that the early ventral bud primordium was composed of a heterogeneous population of pancreatic cells comprising notch-responsive cells, giving rise to ductal and endocrine cells, separated from the ptf1a+ cells, which generate the acinar cells  <cit> . this study raises the question of the identity of the multipotent pancreatic progenitors in the zebrafish ventral pancreatic bud and its derivatives.

here, we show that nkx <dig>  labels multipotent pancreatic progenitors giving rise to all of the different pancreatic cell types  while ascl1b marks endocrine precursors leading to the different endocrine cell types. for this purpose, we have generated two novel bacterial artificial chromosome  transgenic nkx <dig>  and ascl1b reporter lines, tg and tg, that both faithfully recapitulate the expression of the nkx <dig>  and ascl1b endogenous genes. using these novel transgenic tools, we were able to analyze in detail the interdependency between these two factors and their relationship with the notch signaling pathway. we also demonstrate that nkx <dig>  expression persists in the adult ductal tree, notably in the centroacinar/terminal end duct cells , for which we show that they are able to differentiate into insulin-expressing cells in vivo. by isolating nkx <dig> :egfp+ cells from the dissected pancreases of adult fish, we determined the transcriptome of adult pancreatic ductal cells, which revealed the expression of several regulatory genes potentially involved in endocrine regeneration. finally, we provide evidence that regenerating beta cells also originate from ductal cells.

RESULTS
the bacterial artificial chromosome reporter tg recapitulates in vivo the expression of the endogenous nkx <dig>  gene
to label the nkx <dig> -expressing cells, we generated a transgenic line driving the expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein  under the control of nkx <dig>  regulatory regions. we engineered a bac spanning from  <dig> kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of the nkx <dig>  gene and inserted the egfp coding regions into exon  <dig>  replacing the beginning of the nkx <dig>  open reading frame . this bac reporter construct was introduced into the zebrafish genome using the tol <dig> transposon system  <cit>  and the stable transgenic line tg obtained showed expression of green fluorescent protein  in the nervous system and in the pancreas, which mirrors the endogenous nkx <dig>  protein expression . detailed comparison of the localization of these two proteins in the pancreas during development confirmed that gfp is indeed co-expressed with nkx <dig>  . indeed, together with the endogenous nkx <dig>  protein  <cit> , gfp is expressed at the base of the endocrine islet at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf , in the ventral bud at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf , and in ipds and epds at  <dig> days post fertilization  . in contrast, at earlier stages, gfp was detected in a subset of nkx <dig> + cells, probably due to the delay of gfp expression compared to nkx <dig> . indeed, at  <dig> hpf, about  <dig> % of the nkx <dig> + cells showed detectable gfp expression  and at  <dig> hpf, this proportion dropped even further to about 25– <dig> % . conversely, a few hours after the onset of nkx <dig>  gene expression, some gfp+/nkx <dig> – cells were also detected . this gfp labeling is not the result of an ectopic expression of the gfp transcript, as double fluorescent whole-mount in situ hybridization  showed that the gfp transcripts are present in the same pancreatic domain as nkx <dig>  transcripts  and importantly, like nkx <dig> , gfp transcripts were not found in hormone-expressing cells . hence, prolonged gfp detection is rather due to the well-known high stability of gfp , which persists in cells where nkx <dig>  protein is no longer found. this is nicely illustrated at  <dig> hpf, where strong gfp expression is detected at the base of the forming islet where nkx <dig> + pancreatic progenitors are located, while weak gfp labeling is found dorsally within the islet, where differentiated endocrine cells, devoid of nkx <dig> , are clustered . as expected, this prolonged gfp detection will gradually fade away, finally to disappear completely in the differentiated endocrine cells .fig.  <dig> the bacterial artificial chromosome reporter line tg mirrors the expression of the endogenous nkx <dig>  gene. immunodetection of endogenous nkx <dig>   and gfp  in tg embryos of the indicated stages. green arrows point to nkx <dig> –/gfp+ cells and red arrows to nkx <dig> +/gfp- cells. all views are either lateral  or ventral  with the anterior part to the left. they represent either z-plane confocal images  or confocal projection images . scale bars =  <dig> μm. epd extra-pancreatic duct, ipd intra-pancreatic duct, i islet



the high stability of gfp allowed us to perform short-term lineage tracing to follow the immediate progeny arising from nkx <dig> + cells.

nkx <dig> -expressing cells are multipotent progenitors giving rise to all pancreatic cell lineages
using short-term lineage tracing, we first assessed if nkx <dig> + cells can give rise to the first wave of endocrine cells of the dorsal bud using the isl <dig> marker, which labels all mature endocrine cells. in contrast to the endogenous nkx <dig>  and the nkx <dig> :gfp transcripts, which are not co-expressed with isl <dig> , gfp was detected in  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of isl1+ cells in tg embryos  at  <dig> hpf indicating that nkx <dig>  cells can give rise to endocrine cells . also, we found gfp in all different endocrine cell types, i.e. in  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of insulin+  cells  ,  <dig> ±  <dig>  % somatostatin+  cells  , and  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of glucagon+  cells  . the percentage of gfp+ cells in the different endocrine subtypes appeared to depend on the onset of expression for each hormone, which is from  <dig> hpf onward for ins,  <dig> hpf for sst <dig> and  <dig> hpf for gcga. therefore, when the first hormone-expressing cells differentiate from the pool of nkx <dig> + progenitors, only a minority of them have accumulated enough gfp to be detected, as explained above .fig.  <dig>

next, we analyzed whether the nkx <dig> + cells also contribute to the cells originating from the ventral bud . with nkx <dig>  being expressed in all pancreatic ductal cells , we detected accordingly an expression of gfp in all pancreatic ducts labeled by 2f <dig> antibody . in contrast, while endogenous nkx <dig>  never co-localizes with trypsin , a marker of mature acinar cells, gfp was detected in a large majority of acinar cells at  <dig> hpf ), the stage when acinar cells have just begun to differentiate . here again, the prolonged gfp detection in the acinar cells gradually disappears and, from  <dig> dpf, the acinar cells are no longer labeled with gfp . and finally, to determine whether nkx <dig> + cells can give rise to the secondary islets, emerging from ipds, we treated tg larvae with the notch-signaling inhibitor ly <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> dpf to increase the number of late endocrine cells and thereby facilitate their detection  <cit> . in ly411575-treated larvae, we observed an increase of the endocrine cells in the principal islet and the appearance of numerous endocrine cells in the pancreatic tail , as previously reported. all these endocrine cells are co-labeled with gfp  indicating that the nkx <dig> + ductal cells can also give rise to the secondary islets.

these data indicate that nkx <dig> -expressing cells are multi-lineage pancreatic progenitors, which can differentiate into endocrine, acinar, and ductal cells.

ascl1b-expressing cells give rise exclusively to the endocrine lineage
to determine whether ascl1b is expressed in the multipotent pancreatic progenitors or in the endocrine precursors, we determined the cell fate of the ascl1b-expressing cells. to that end, a bac reporter tg was engineered where the bicistronic transcript egfp-2a-creert <dig> is under the control of the promoter and regulatory sequences of ascl1b. thus, we replaced the beginning of the ascl1b open reading frame with an egfp-2a-creert <dig> cassette . the expression profile of gfp in the stable transgenic line tg faithfully recapitulates the expression of the endogenous ascl1b transcript .

cell fate experiments were performed with cre/loxp-based lineage tracing approaches by crossing the tg with cre-responder transgenic lines, either tg, termed tg  <cit> , or tg, termed tg  <cit>  . the double-transgenic embryos were treated five times with 4-hydroxytamoxifen  from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf, the period when ascl1b expression reaches its maximal level  <cit> , and the embryos were analyzed at  <dig> or  <dig> hpf. with these five 4oht treatments, many ascl1b-expressing cells have undergone cre recombination while no recombination was detected in the treated single-transgenic embryos used as control . the cre-mediated recombination  marker  analyzed in double-transgenic embryos at  <dig> hpf was detected in  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of isl1+ cells , indicating that ascl1b+ cells give rise to the endocrine cells of the dorsal bud . in a similar way, the rec marker was detected in  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of the ins+ cells   and in  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of the gcg+ cells  . in contrast, the rec marker, clearly visible in the endocrine islet, was not detected at  <dig> hpf in the ductal cells, labeled by nkx <dig> , nor in the acinar cells, which surround them , indicating that ascl1b+ cells cannot give rise to exocrine cells. finally, we determined whether the ascl1b+ cells give rise to the secondary islets emerging from ipds, either artificially induced by inhibiting the notch pathway or naturally occurring in 20-dpf larvae. as the combined treatment of ly <dig> with 4oht was lethal, we performed short-term lineage tracing based on gfp expression . as shown in fig. 3f, g, ly <dig> treatment from  <dig> to  <dig> days of the tg larvae led to the appearance of gfp cells all along the ipds, most of these cells being also positive for glucagon or insulin hormones , indicating that ascl1b+ cells give rise to induced secondary islets. to trace the naturally occurring endocrine cells, we treated tg; tg larvae with 4oht at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpf and analyzed the larvae at  <dig> dpf. the rec marker was detected within the principal islet  as well as in secondary islets  confirming that ascl1b+ cells can give rise to secondary islets.fig.  <dig>

in conclusion, our data demonstrate that ascl1b+ cells exclusively give rise to the endocrine cells originating from both the dorsal and ventral buds.

nkx <dig>  and ascl1b are first co-expressed in the endocrine precursors of the dorsal bud but rapidly their expression domain segregates
as presented above, nkx <dig>  is expressed in the multipotent pancreatic progenitors and ascl1b in the endocrine precursors; we therefore analyzed the relationship between these two populations by comparing the nkx <dig>  and gfp proteins in tg embryos. at  <dig> hpf, the ascl1b:egfp cells delineate two lines adjacent to the midline . these cells correspond to the most medial endodermal cells , reported to give rise mostly to pancreatic endocrine cells  <cit> . at this stage, all of these ascl1b:egfp cells also express nkx <dig> . in contrast, the nkx <dig>  expression domain is larger and, in addition to its expression in the hypochord , it is also expressed in the lateral cells, reported to give rise to exocrine and intestinal cells  <cit> . rapidly, these two domains segregate since, as early as  <dig> hour later, the majority of ascl1b:egfp+ cells no longer express nkx <dig>  . thus, separation of the two domains is largely completed when hormone-expressing cells start differentiating.fig.  <dig>

to determine whether such segregation results from a mutual repression, we examined whether the loss of ascl1b leads to an increase of nkx <dig>  expression and vice versa. we generated ascl1b and nkx <dig>  loss-of-function mutants using the crispr/cas <dig> genome editing technology  <cit>  . as shown in additional file 3: fig. s <dig>  the loss of ascl1b does not affect the expression of nkx <dig>   while it significantly reduces the number of sst2+ cells , as reported for the ascl1b morphants  <cit> . in the same way, ascl1b expression does not increase in nkx <dig>  loss-of-function mutant embryos , for which the effective loss of nkx <dig>  expression was confirmed by immunodetection of nkx <dig>   and by the drastic reduction in the number of gcg+ cells , as reported for the nkx <dig>  morphants  <cit> .

ascl1b and nkx <dig>  are regulated in an opposite way by the notch signaling pathway
we then tested whether the segregation of the ascl1b and nkx <dig>  expression domains results from a different response to the delta/notch signaling pathway. to analyze the impact of notch signaling on nkx <dig>  and ascl1b expression, we performed notch loss- and gain-of- function analyses. we first analyzed the expression of nkx <dig>  and ascl1b in mind bomb mutants  in which notch signaling is disrupted  <cit> . as previously reported  <cit> , expression of ascl1b is strongly increased in mib embryos at  <dig> hpf , in both the pancreas and the nervous system. the opposite effect was observed for nkx <dig>  whose expression is reduced at the same stage  and completely lost at  <dig> hpf . this suggests that the notch signaling pathway is essential for maintaining nkx <dig>  expression but not for its initiation. this was confirmed by the finding that, at  <dig> hpf, nkx <dig>  expression was unchanged in mib mutants while ascl1b was already upregulated .fig.  <dig> 
ascl1b and nkx <dig>  are regulated in an opposite way by the notch signaling pathway. a–f wish on wild-type  embryos  or mind bomb  mutants  with ascl1b  or nkx <dig>   probes. brackets delimit the pancreatic domain. g, h immunodetection of gfp and endogenous nkx <dig>  in 5-dpf tg embryos treated from  <dig> to  <dig> dpf with dmso  or with the notch signaling inhibitor, ly <dig> . i–n wish with ascl1b  or nkx <dig>   probes or immunodetection of endogenous nkx <dig>   of double-transgenic tg x tg embryos  or of control simple-transgenic embryos , both heat-shocked at  <dig> hpf for  <dig> min. lateral views  or ventral views  of embryos of the indicated stages with the anterior to the left. scale bars =  <dig> μm



the same conclusion was drawn for the ventral bud where treatment for 3– <dig> dpf with the ly <dig> notch inhibitor led to a complete loss of nkx <dig>  expression and a drastic increase of ascl1b:egfp at  <dig> dpf . like the dorsal bud, the initiation of nkx <dig>  expression in the ventral bud is not dependent on notch signaling as its expression at  <dig> hpf was not perturbed in the mib mutant .

for gain-of-function approaches, we crossed the tg with tg  <cit>  and heat-shocked the embryos at  <dig> hpf to overexpress the notch intracellular domain . at  <dig> hours after the heat-shock, we observed a complete loss of ascl1b expression  concomitant with an increase of nkx <dig>  in the nicd overexpressed embryos . this increase was even more important at  <dig> hpf, when a drastic expansion in the number of nkx <dig> + cells was observed in the embryos overexpressing nicd  compared to the control .

in conclusion, these data show that notch signaling represses ascl1b expression while it is essential for maintaining nkx <dig>  expression. by contrast, the initiation of nkx <dig>  expression is independent of notch activity, both in the dorsal and the ventral buds.

most, but not all, nkx <dig> + cells are notch-responsive cells
nkx <dig>  being dependent on notch signaling for maintaining its own expression, this prompted us to compare the location of the notch-responsive cells and the nkx <dig> + cells using the tg  <cit>  or tg  <cit>  lines in which fluorescent markers are under the control of notch-responsive elements . in the prospective dorsal bud, we could detect venus labeling in a subset of nkx <dig>  cells at  <dig> hpf  while  <dig> hours later , venus was found in the vast majority of nkx <dig> + cells . similarly, at the beginning of the formation of the ventral bud , only a subpopulation of nkx <dig> + cells present some notch activity  while at  <dig> hpf, the vast majority of nkx <dig> + cells show notch activity with the exception of the epd anlagen , known to be notch inactive  <cit> . at  <dig> days, virtually all nkx <dig> + cells are notch-responsive in the ipds  .fig.  <dig> the pancreatic expression domain of nkx <dig>  includes the notch-responsive cells. immunodetection of endogenous nkx <dig>   and venus  in tg  or gfp in tg embryos  at the indicated stages. all views are ventral with the anterior part to the left and represent either z-plane confocal images  or confocal projection images . scale bars =  <dig> μm. epd extra-pancreatic duct, ipd intra-pancreatic duct



in conclusion, these observations indicate that, in both the dorsal and ventral buds, nkx <dig> + cells progressively acquire notch signaling activity, essential for maintaining nkx <dig>  expression.

nkx <dig>  expression persists in ductal cells in the pancreas of adult zebrafish
we then wanted to characterize nkx <dig>  expression in the pancreas of adult zebrafish. immunodetection on paraffin sections through the pancreas of tg fish that were  <dig> to  <dig> months old revealed that nkx <dig> :egfp expression persists in adult zebrafish . comparison of endogenous nkx <dig>  protein and gfp shows that, in the adult too, tg recapitulates the pattern of nkx <dig>  expression . nkx <dig> :egfp expression is confined to the ducts and to isolated cells scattered throughout the exocrine tissue and was not detected in beta cells  or acinar cells. these nkx <dig> :egfp+ cells dispersed within the exocrine pancreas exhibit long cellular extensions characteristic of cacs   <cit> . in the adult zebrafish pancreas, as in mammals, the cacs can also be identified by notch signaling activity  <cit> . thus, to confirm the expression of nkx <dig>  in cacs, we used the notch reporter line tg  <cit> , in which the destabilized venus fluorescent protein  highlights cells harboring ongoing notch activity, and which labels the cacs, as expected . all venus+ cells in the pancreas were found exclusively in the ductal system, and more particularly in the cacs and not within the ductular structures . comparison of venus with nkx <dig>  confirmed that nkx <dig>  is indeed expressed in all venus+ cacs . in contrast, while ducts also display nkx <dig>  expression as revealed with either nkx <dig> :egfp  or with the endogenous nkx <dig>  protein , they are devoid of notch ongoing activity .fig.  <dig> expression of nkx <dig>  persists in duct cells in the adult pancreas. a gfp and insulin  immunodetection on section through the pancreas of adult tg zebrafish. white arrows point to pancreatic ducts and asterisks show cells  dispersed throughout the exocrine tissue). a' close-up of the islet highlighted with ins. b venus  and ins  immunodetection in tg showing the presence of venus in cacs  as previously reported  <cit> , but not in duct cells within ductular structures . insets in  and  show isolated cacs. c–d immunodetection of venus  and of endogenous nkx <dig>   in tg revealing co-labeling of both markers in cacs  while nkx <dig>  alone, but not venus, labels the ducts. the white arrow in  points to a duct and asterisks indicate cacs. dotted yellow lines delimit the duct. c' same as  showing nkx <dig>   and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  only. i, islet

adult centroacinar cells display progenitor capacity in physiological conditions
we then asked whether cacs could generate other pancreatic cell types in adult zebrafish under physiological conditions by using the double tg; tg in which the stable h2bmcherry protein labels cells harboring ongoing notch activity  and cells having previously experienced notch activity   <cit> . this tool has been previously exploited to characterize and follow the fate of the notch-responsive progenitors in the ipds of larvae  <cit> . we thus characterized the venus– h2bmcherry+ cells in adult fish to identify the pancreatic cell types derived from cacs. in about  <dig> % of all h2bmcherry+ cells, notch activity was switched off . many of these cells, with weak h2bmcherry labeling, were identified within small ducts , which can be identified by the ductal marker 2f <dig>   <cit>  or by nkx <dig>  , and at the tip of which reside cacs . furthermore, low levels of h2bmcherry were also identified in some insulin-expressing cells . about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  of the h2bmcherry+/notch off  display ins labeling. these findings show that mcherry+ terminal end duct cells and insulin-expressing cells originate from notch positive cacs. overall, this reveals that a subset of the nkx <dig> + ductal cells, the notch-responsive cacs, can generate ductal and endocrine cells.

to determine the capacity of cacs to replicate, their proliferative status was analyzed using 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine  labeling and proliferating cell nuclear antigen  immunodetection in tg adult fish. one day after edu injection, a small fraction of cacs  had incorporated edu. all these edu+ venus+ cells also express the proliferation marker pcna . in contrast,  <dig> days post injection, venus+ cells that still display edu labeling were no longer pcna+ , but still harbor characteristics of cacs, suggesting that they became post-mitotic cacs. the capacity of cacs to replicate together with their ability to undergo ductal and endocrine differentiation indicate that they can behave as adult pancreatic progenitor/stem cells in vivo.

nkx <dig> -expressing ductal cells contribute to beta cell regeneration in adult zebrafish
the capacity of cacs to differentiate into beta cell in the normal adult zebrafish raises the question whether similar plasticity exists for regeneration. to induce beta cell regeneration, we used the tg line  <cit>  and treatment with metronidazole . the metronidazole is converted into a cytotoxic compound by the nitroreductase enzyme , which thereby triggers selective beta cell death by apoptosis  <cit> . in adult zebrafish, the ablation of beta cells causes dramatic hyperglycemia within  <dig> days rapidly followed by spontaneous normalization within  <dig> weeks and beta cell regeneration  <cit> . to analyze the ductal cells in the setting of beta cell regeneration, tg; tg adult fish were treated with mtz  and sacrificed at different time points during regeneration to analyze gfp and ins on tissue sections at the level of the principal islet. the blood glucose level was measured just before sacrifice. at  <dig> days post treatment , ablation was total and effective as reported  <cit> . mtz-treated fish displayed severe hyperglycemia as expected  while the glycemia of non-treated fish was at normal values of  <dig> ±  <dig> mg/dl . immunolabeling at  <dig> dpt indicated total beta cell ablation as manifested by the absence of insulin staining in the pancreas of mtz-treated tg; tg fish . at  <dig> dpt, the first new beta cells have started to reappear . glycemia was still above normal values but nonetheless had decreased . the principal islet in the treated fish still showed very weak insulin expression but a few new beta cells  can be detected in the principal islet as well as throughout the exocrine tissue as isolated cells or as small clusters of ins-expressing cells next to cacs and ductal cells marked by gfp . the presence of insulin-expressing cells at  <dig> dpt is indicative of beta cell regeneration. interestingly, some of the regenerating insulin+ cells displayed weak gfp staining  . these cells were found next to strongly gfp-labeled ductal nkx <dig> :egfp cells. gfp+ ins+ cells were also detected at  <dig> dpt  . at this stage, a large number of beta cells have recovered   <cit>  and glycemia was normalized . in contrast, insulin+ cells never harbor gfp labeling in non-treated fish . thus, by using the same approach of short-term tracing of nkx <dig> :egfp+ cells as in embryos, this finding strongly suggests that ductal nkx <dig> :egfp+ cells contribute to regenerated beta cells.fig.  <dig> nkx <dig> :egfp+ cells proliferate and differentiate into new insulin-expressing cells after beta cell specific ablation. gfp  and ins  labeling in the pancreas of tg; tg adult fish. a, b non-treated fish  show intense ins staining in beta cells, while ins+ cells are not detected  <dig> dpt with mtz, indicating efficient ablation . note that debris of one beta cell  is observed in the islet. c at  <dig> dpt, ins-expressing cells start to be detected in the principal islet and in extra-insular locations close to ductal gfp+ cells . d at  <dig> dpt, islets show intense ins staining consistent with beta cell recovery. e–g  while gfp is never detected in beta cells of control fish , some regenerating ins+ cells display weak gfp labeling at both stages of regeneration analyzed, i.e. at  <dig> dpt  and  <dig> dpt . h, i  beta cell ablation triggers proliferation of cacs as shown at  <dig> dpt  compared to ctl  . i islet



next we assessed proliferation in tg; tg in response to beta cell ablation. three days post treatment, nkx <dig> :egfp ductal cells showed increased proliferation as illustrated with pcna . this was observed not only within ductal structures as previously described  but also for cacs. these observations suggest that ductal cells with pancreatic progenitor properties activate proliferation prior to differentiation into beta cells during regeneration.

to get a comprehensive characterization of pancreatic nkx <dig> + ductal cells in adult zebrafish, we determined their transcriptome landscape. ductal gfp+ cells were isolated from dissected pancreases of adult tg fish  and used in rna-seq experiments. the expression of  <dig>  genes could be detected in the ductal transcriptome , in which many genes already known to be expressed in pancreatic ducts in either zebrafish or mammals were found at high expression level, such as sox9b, hnf1ba, onecut1/hnf <dig>  cftr, cdh <dig>  ca <dig>  and ctgfa in addition to nkx <dig>  . we also detected expression of fgfr <dig> and sdc <dig>  recently proposed as novel ductal markers in the murine embryonic pancreas  <cit> . in contrast to these ductal genes, the acinar markers ptf1a and rbpjl, the pan-endocrine markers pax6b and isl <dig>  and the lineage specific genes mnx <dig> and arx were either not detected or detected at extremely low levels in the nkx <dig> :egfp+ ductal cells transcriptome , underscoring the accuracy of our fluorescence-activated cell sorting  cell preparations. in contrast to mouse or human adults in which the embryonic pancreatic progenitor marker pdx <dig> is not expressed in the pancreatic ducts in normal condition, nkx <dig> :egfp+ duct cells of healthy zebrafish display a robust expression of pdx <dig>  comparison of the duct transcriptome with those of pancreatic acinar and endocrine cells  highlighted  <dig>  genes with preferential expression in duct cells. among them,  <dig> duct-specific genes were identified with strong enrichment  and low expression in the other pancreatic cells , in which we find sox9b, onecut1/hnf <dig>  cdh <dig>  ctgfa, and nkx <dig> , corroborating their status as duct-specific markers. various components of the notch signaling pathway could also be identified, namely notch <dig>  and different hairy and enhancer of split-related genes , confirming that a subpopulation of nkx <dig> + cells  experiences notch activity. in addition to genes involved in the notch signaling cascade, our analyses also identified novel duct-specific markers such as id2a, encoding for a hlh transcription factor, which we also detected co-expressed with sox9b by wish in 3-dpf larvae , and several components of the wnt pathways such as the wnt and sfrp ligands sfrp <dig>  sfrp3/frzb, and wnt7bb . at a lower expression level, we could also detect the wnt receptor fzd7a, which was the only wnt receptor significantly expressed in the adult pancreas . these observations suggest that wnt signaling may play an important role in adult ducts.fig.  <dig> expression of known pancreatic markers in the transcriptome of adult nkx <dig> :egfp cells. expression values are expressed as normalized counts. high expression of known ductal genes  is detected while acinar  and endocrine  markers display low abundance, with the exception of pdx <dig> and ascl1b 



strikingly, the only endocrine transcription factor that displayed substantial expression  and enrichment in the ductal transcriptome was the pro-endocrine gene ascl1b . as ascl1b specifically marks the endocrine precursors during pancreas development, these data support our observation that, within the nkx <dig> :egfp+ cell domain, some cells activate a pro-endocrine differentiation program in normal adult zebrafish.

discussion
in this study, we determined during development the fate of two pancreatic cell populations marked by nkx <dig>  and ascl1b and found that nkx <dig> + cells are bona fide multipotent pancreatic progenitors while ascl1b+ cells represent committed endocrine precursors. we found also that nkx <dig>  is maintained in adult zebrafish in ducts and cac/terminal end duct cells, which we show still have the potential to give rise to endocrine cells in normal  animals. the progenitor potency of adult nkx <dig> + cells is also reflected in their transcriptome through the expression of several pancreatic progenitor markers and by their capacity to generate new beta cells after beta cell ablation.

although ascl1b marks the endocrine precursor cells, as opposed to nkx <dig> , which is the first multipotent pancreatic progenitor marker known to date, it is surprising to note that this transcription factor begins to be expressed in the prospective pancreatic region at  <dig> hpf  <cit> , i.e. more than  <dig> hour before the appearance of nkx <dig>    <cit> . pdx <dig>  known in the mouse to be also expressed in the multipotent pancreatic progenitors, appears even later . this brings the interesting concept that the first cells in the pancreatic anlagen acquire an endocrine identity before acquiring a pancreatic identity, suggesting that the mechanisms controlling pancreatic and endocrine identity are not necessary linked and can act in parallel. this situation seems to be restricted to the dorsal bud as, later, nkx <dig>  is first expressed during the formation of the ventral bud and ascl1b is then detected in endocrine committed cells. this peculiar situation could be related to the different lineage potential of the dorsal versus ventral bud cells. indeed the dorsal bud gives rise exclusively to endocrine cells while the ventral bud is able to give rise to all pancreatic cell types  <cit> .

after a transient overlapping expression in the dorsal pancreatic anlagen, nkx <dig> - and ascl1b-expressing domains segregate progressively. cross-repressive interactions between lineage-determining transcription factors have been proposed as a molecular mechanism for establishing lineage allocation in several tissues . we show that such a mechanism does not occur here, as we could not observe any cross-repression between nkx <dig>  and ascl1b in the dorsal bud when analyzing both mutants. the segregation can instead be explained by the opposite effects of the notch signaling pathway on nkx <dig>  and ascl1b expression. by loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we definitely prove that ascl1b is repressed, while nkx <dig>  is maintained, by notch signaling in both the dorsal and ventral buds. the importance of notch signaling in regulating nkx <dig>  expression has been also shown in mice where disruption of notch signaling results in the loss of the pro-trunk determinant nkx <dig>  and the acquisition of pro-acinar identity  <cit> . direct binding of rbpj-k to the nkx <dig>  promoter supports a direct role of notch signaling in the expression of nkx <dig> . in contrast, the initiation of nkx <dig>  expression is independent of notch signaling in both zebrafish pancreatic buds. this is in accordance with our findings that nkx <dig> + cells progressively become notch-responsive pncs being found only in a subpopulation of the nkx <dig> + cells at the beginning of the formation of both the dorsal and ventral buds. this could explain why the pncs, found in a subdomain of the ventral bud at an early stage, can differentiate only into ductal and endocrine cells, while nkx <dig> -expressing cells give rise to all pancreatic cell types. as nkx <dig>  and ptf1a are initially co-expressed in the ventral bud primordium , we can hypothesize that the nkx <dig> +/ptf1a+/notch on cells give rise to the ductal and late endocrine cells while the nkx <dig> +/ptf1a+/notch off cells will give rise to the acinar cells. this model appears to contradict the data of wang et al.  <cit>  showing that the ventral bud primordium consists of two non-overlapping cell populations: a ptf1-expressing domain and a notch-responsive progenitor core. it is possible that this discrepancy is due to the tools used to label the notch-responsive cells: in our study, we used the tp1bglob:venuspest transgenic line allowing the detection of cells with current notch activity, while wang and collaborators used the tp1bglob:hgmb1-mcherry line, which could show a delay in mcherry detection.

in adult zebrafish, nkx <dig>  expression persists in the pancreas where it is specifically restricted to the ducts. this situation is different in the mouse as nkx <dig>  persists in beta cells but not in adult ducts. in zebrafish, it is nkx <dig> , an nkx <dig>  homolog with functional equivalence  <cit> , which is expressed specifically in beta cells  <cit> , suggesting that the nkx <dig> function in beta cells is fulfilled by nkx <dig>  in zebrafish. persistence of nkx <dig>  expression in the zebrafish ducts is also associated with persistence of another pancreatic progenitor marker, pdx <dig>  whose expression is also restricted to beta cells in mammals. combined with other hallmarks of embryonic pancreatic progenitors such as sox9b, hnf1ba, and notch signaling components, the expression of genes nkx <dig>  and pdx <dig> suggests that at least some ductal cells behave as pancreatic progenitors in adult zebrafish. moreover, detection of the endocrine precursor marker ascl1b in the adult nkx <dig> :egfp+ ductal cell transcriptome is consistent with some ductal cells initiating an endocrine differentiation program and transiently expressing ascl1b, even in physiological conditions. the progenitor potential of ductal cells is fully revealed in the setting of beta cell regeneration where nkx <dig> :egfp+ cells show increased proliferation as well as the ability to differentiate into new beta cells. the adult pancreatic progenitors contributing to beta cell regeneration could be the cacs, as supported by our observation that they are able to replicate and to generate other ductal cells as well as endocrine beta cells. on the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that other ductal cells also contribute to regeneration based on tg, which labels more broadly the ducts. nevertheless, although the tool we used here to monitor lineage tracing presents some limitations , during the revision of our manuscript, a study by delaspre et al.  <cit>  established through cre-based genetic labeling that notch-responsive cells give rise to regenerated beta cells in adult zebrafish. our data are in full accordance with their findings, and support the conclusion that ductal cells, possibly cacs, possess regenerative capacity. to determine whether cacs only or other ductal cells contribute to beta cell regeneration will require other genetic lineage tracings with markers expressed only in ductular structures and not in cacs.

in contrast to mammals, the adult zebrafish has the remarkable capacity to regenerate its beta cells rapidly and spontaneously following their selective destruction  <cit> . our findings showing that ductal cells, such as cacs, behave as pancreatic progenitors/stem cells in normal  adult animals and during regeneration strongly suggest that they could also constitute a source of regenerated beta cells in diabetic mammalian models. in the mouse, adult murine cacs display endocrine and exocrine progenitor potential in vitro with self-renewing ability  <cit> , but evidences of their potential in vivo as progenitors of endocrine cells are missing. indeed, cre-based cell tracing of hes1+ terminal duct cells/cacs in adult mice failed to show any islet progenitor capacity while these cells seemed to contribute to the ductal tree  <cit> . one explanation for this difference would be that while zebrafish cacs present pancreatic progenitor activity, mammalian cacs have retained a very limited capacity in vivo, which could not be evidenced in the mouse model of beta cell regeneration used. another explanation would be that cacs form a heterogeneous cell population. this latter hypothesis could be verified by the analysis of the expression of different ductal markers identified in our transcriptome, which could help determine the existence of different ductal cell subpopulations.

a perspective of our work would be to examine thoroughly in zebrafish ductal cells in physiological conditions and during beta regeneration to identify mechanisms that could then be harnessed to promote beta cell regeneration in mammals. a first clue is provided by the fact that nkx <dig>  and pdx <dig> are normally not expressed in mammalian duct cells, in contrast to zebrafish. it is therefore tempting to hypothesize that inducing the expression of these two factors in the pancreatic ducts in the adult mouse or human could enhance their progenitor potential. consistent with this hypothesis, driving ectopic pdx <dig> expression is already harnessed for transdifferentiating different cells into beta cells in vivo   and for transdifferentiating pancreatic duct cells into beta cells in vitro  <cit> . interestingly, the ability of pdx <dig> to reprogram liver cells into beta cells is substantially increased by the combined action of nkx <dig>   <cit> , which potentiates induction of the early pancreatic master genes neurog <dig> and isl <dig> 

in the zebrafish larvae, two sources have been described for the regeneration of beta cells: progenitor cells in the developing ducts  <cit>  and alpha cells  <cit> . from our data in adults, we cannot rule out the contribution by other cell types than ductal cells. indeed, in addition to increased proliferation of ductal cells, some islet cells show also increased proliferation after beta cell destruction  suggesting the involvement of other pancreatic, and possibly endocrine, cell types in regeneration. these possibilities remain to be validated in the adult zebrafish.

our transcriptomic characterization of nkx <dig> + cells in normal non-regenerating adult zebrafish identified many of the ductal markers known throughout species, showing that many of these genes and their expression are conserved between zebrafish and mammals, as for example, different markers of notch signaling , and sdc <dig> and fgfr <dig>  these latter two genes have been previously proposed as ductal markers in the mouse embryo  <cit> . additional markers were also identified here, notably id2a. id <dig> has been shown to be expressed in ductal epithelial cells of ifnγnod mice, a model of a regenerating pancreas harboring hyperplasic ducts, and to be involved in their expansion  <cit> . we demonstrate here its expression in ducts in larvae and in healthy adult pancreas, which may correlate with a role in development and in ductal constitutive homeostasis. our findings also reveal that, besides the notch pathway, ductal cells specifically express various components of wnt signaling pathways. the expression of the fzd7a receptor, of two secreted wnt antagonists, sfrp <dig> and frzb/sfrp <dig>  and of the agonist wnt7bb suggests a complex control of the activity of the wnt pathway in adult pancreatic ducts. whether and how these different factors orchestrate pancreatic duct development, homeostasis, and function remains to be determined. numerous cross-talks between the notch and the wnt/beta-catenin pathways occur during development, tissue homeostasis, and disease, notably by regulating the balance of stem cells and differentiated cells . during pancreas development, beta-catenin controls the patterning of multipotent versus bipotent embryonic pancreatic progenitors in the mouse, in part, by inhibiting notch signaling  <cit> . our findings raise the question whether similar interactions shape the fate decision of progenitors/stem cells in the adult pancreas.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed transgenic tools enabling the characterization of nkx <dig> + and ascl1b+ progenitor cell populations and showed that, in the zebrafish embryo, nkx <dig> + cells are multipotent pancreatic progenitors, while ascl1b+ cells represent committed endocrine precursors. in adult zebrafish, nkx <dig>  expression persists exclusively in the ductal tree, notably in cacs. transcriptomic profiling of adult nkx <dig> + ductal cells reveals hallmarks of embryonic pancreatic progenitors and identifies novel ductal markers. our data also strongly suggest that adult zebrafish ductal cells, possibly cacs, possess regenerative capacity. further characterization of ductal cells in this animal model should bring new insight into regeneration in mammals and open up new perspectives for anti-diabetic therapies.
