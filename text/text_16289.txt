BACKGROUND
in alternative pre-mrna splicing, multiple transcript isoforms are expressed from a single gene by varying the combination of exons that are included in the mature mrna. these isoforms may differ in their transcript and protein stabilities and/or in their protein structures and activities, which allows for functional and physiological diversity  <cit> . alternative splicing affects up to 74% of all genes and may cause epigenetic instability when aberrant  <cit> . in cancer, two major mechanisms lead to the dysregulation of proper splicing: somatic mutations in splice regulatory cis-elements and mis-expression of trans-acting factors  <cit> . the second phenomenon has been reported in numerous cancers including glioma, ovarian and colon cancer  <cit> . furthermore, many individual genes have cancer-predominant splicing patterns that contribute to tumorigenesis  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether the tumor-specific misexpression of splice factors leads to global aberrant splicing in cancer. genome-wide attempts to address this have been performed mostly in silico by aligning and comparing est libraries. several hundred isoforms appear to be unique to tumor libraries, but these analyses are largely incomplete as they can miss known isoforms and are intrinsically biased in their scoring of single clones  <cit> .

of all tissues, the brain has the most cassette exon alternative splicing  <cit> . this tissue-specific splicing is responsible for proper neural cell differentiation and neurotransmitter signaling that may be misregulated to allow stem-cell like proliferation to form brain tumors  <cit> . gliomas are glial-like tumors, with glioblastoma  being the most severe form  <cit> . independent and in silico genome-wide assessments have identified genes expressing particular splice isoforms more frequently in glioma than in normal brain. among the  <dig> individual  and the five in silico studies , only three of the genes, bin <dig>  max and mpzl <dig> were in common. because of these discrepancies, we performed a global, unbiased study using the human exon expression array  to experimentally identify common glioma-specific aberrant splicing events and misexpressed splicing factors. our data indicate that overall aberrant tumor-specific cassette exon splicing events involve small changes, less than 5-fold. few splicing factors had dramatically altered expression in glioma, but could be targeting the genes that were identified as having significant glioma-specific splicing in our study.

RESULTS
exon array analysis
to measure significant alternative splicing changes associated with primary brain tumors, we compared genome-wide exon expression levels of  <dig> grade iv glioblastoma  and  <dig> nontumor brain samples using the human exon array  <dig>  st   <cit> . multiple statistical algorithms were developed to identify alternative pre-mrna splicing events . the differential expression  value describes the difference in the average expression of all exons for a given refseq entry between two groups of samples . a de =  <dig> indicates no change in transcript expression between the two groups, a de <  <dig> and a de >  <dig> indicates decreased or increased gene expression in the disease group, respectively. the alternative splicing  score was generated to identify all types of alternative pre-mrna splicing events as detected by differential hybridization of a psr . the higher the as score for a given refseq entry, the greater the extent to which at least one psr deviated in its differential hybridization compared with all other probe sets in that refseq. to assign a biologically relevant parameter to the as score, we performed modeling of a cassette exon splicing event for a 3-exon gene. this gave median theoretical as scores when comparing a 5% level of exon inclusion in one sample with a 25%, 50%, and 100% inclusion level in the second sample of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. as a final parameter, we included a p-value calculation, which indicates the probability that an as score would show the presence of alternative splicing. we focused on a core set of refseq entries  with p-values of less than  <dig> , and used the de value plotted against the as score to evaluate the relationship between expression and change in alternative splicing.

examination of fgfr <dig> glioma-specific splicing by exon array
in order to assess the specificity, sensitivity and feasibility of an array-based, genome-wide approach to identify alternative splice events, we determined the effect of altering a glioma-specific splicing event in u <dig> cells. antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were used to switch exon  <dig> inclusion in fgfr <dig> mrna precursors from its aberrant skipping to inclusion, as occurs in normal brain  <cit>  . figure 1a shows the plot of de vs. as values for  <dig>  core set refseq entries from this exon array experiment. the fgfr1-specific splicing switch was easily distinguishable for five fgfr <dig> refseq entries that include probesets that monitor exon  <dig> inclusion . the change in exon  <dig> splicing led to significant as scores , which were well above the median derived value for a 10-fold increase in exon inclusion. finally, the de values between  <dig>  to  <dig>  also agreed with rt-pcr results that showed little change in fgfr <dig> expression when splicing of exon  <dig> was altered.

the induced fgfr <dig> splicing switch also caused a large change in the splicing score of nrg <dig> . however, the hybridization map and rt-pcr validation suggest it is a cross-hybridization artifact . there were  <dig> other refseq entries, representing  <dig> genes that showed significant  changes in exon  <dig> usage after treatment . these changes may be regulated by the effect of exon  <dig> inclusion on fgfr <dig> signaling. overall, the u <dig> experiments confirmed that targeted changes in alternative splicing of cassette exons would be reflected in high as scores and p-values <  <dig>  on the exon array. these data indicated the general feasibility of the exon array and our analytical approach to identify cassette exon changes on a genome-wide level.

detection of alternative splicing in gbm patient samples
next, we compared the genome-wide exon expression levels in  <dig> gbm and  <dig> nontumor samples . the shape and distribution of the refseq values differed greatly for the patient samples compared to the fgfr <dig> experiment. only four genes had as scores above the derived median for a 10-fold change in splicing . unlike fgfr <dig>  these genes had high levels of differential expression between nontumor and tumor samples, which appeared to impact their as scores. cntnap <dig> and hist1h3b are intronless genes that do not represent alternative splicing. the event in mal <dig> involved exon  <dig> and could not be explained by alternative splicing. the event identified for mobp was not amenable to rt-pcr verification . finally, a significant 3' splice site event was predicted in the heat map of nkx6- <dig>  which could not be confirmed by rt-pcr .

in the absence of readily identifiable large splicing changes, we went on to validate our algorithm parameters. from several hundred manually examined refseq entries, we chose to validate over  <dig> genes with hybridization heatmaps suggestive of cassette exon pre-mrna splicing. these genes represented a broad range of as scores, de values, and p-values . validation was performed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr on three glioma cell lines , a normal brain control, and a subset of samples from the patient set used for the array experiments . we could make confident conclusions for  <dig>  of these genes . we chose to exclude the remaining genes from our analysis due to low expression levels, which made it difficult to make definitive interpretations. the  <dig> genes were represented by a total of  <dig> refseq entries, with  <dig> entries exhibiting p-values <  <dig> . five entries had as scores that were greater than the derived median for a 5-fold change in splicing. we confirmed glioma-specific splicing for eight genes represented by  <dig> refseq entries: a2bp <dig>  bcas <dig>  cacna1g, cald <dig>  clta, kcnc <dig>  sncb and tpd52l <dig>  the most dramatic cassette exon changes occurred in regions where the de values approached  <dig> and the as scores were above  <dig> as was the case with both clta and tpd52l <dig>  the lack of glioma-specific splicing was confirmed for  <dig> genes  with p-value >  <dig> : alg <dig>  casp <dig> emid <dig>  fgfr <dig>  pcnt <dig>  lair <dig>  mdm <dig>  mnt, nav <dig>  pacsin <dig>  pecam <dig> and tpm <dig>  overall, rt-pcr results were concordant with array data for  <dig> of  <dig> refseq entries . the majority of nonconcordant samples were for genes that had p-values <  <dig> , where glioma-specific splicing could not be confirmed . the statistical filtering missed at least six glioma-specific splicing events . these genes had varying degrees of glioma-specific splicing and included appa <dig>  cltb, dync1i <dig>  nf <dig>  rtn <dig> and tnc . however, rt-pcr data suggested that most of these genes would have had as scores exceeding the 5-fold threshold with the exception of nf <dig> and cltb. figure 2b shows the rt-pcr results of  <dig> representative genes. in total, we found  <dig> genes with glioma-specific splicing: a2bp <dig>  appa <dig>  bcas <dig>  cacna1g, cald <dig>  clta, cltb, dync1i <dig>  kcnc <dig>  nf <dig>  rtn <dig>  sncb, tnc and tpd52l <dig> 

as an additional step to determine the accuracy of the exon array platform and our algorithm, we specifically queried previously reported gbm-specific splicing events within our dataset. figure 3a plots the array values obtained in our patient set for  <dig> independently identified gbm-specific pre-mrna splicing events , represented by a total of  <dig> refseq entries . for all of these genes, the as scores fell below the derived 5-fold change in splicing . only cald <dig>  cacna1g and camk2a had p-values <  <dig>  that predicted strong differential splicing, while bin <dig>  cd <dig>  rfx <dig> and tnc had as scores close to that of camk2a, showing small changes in splicing. validation of a subset of these genes  by semi-quantitative rt-pcr confirmed gbm-specific splicing for four of seven  reported splicing events: cacna1g, cald <dig>  nf <dig> and tnc . cacna1g had enhanced exon inclusion in the glioma cell lines, with a less pronounced change in the gbm patient samples . the cald <dig> differential exon inclusion event was present predominantly in glioma cell lines and gbm patient samples. for tnc, the gbm patient samples had more exon inclusion compared with the nontumor brain samples, which was opposite to the cell lines and previously reported findings  <cit> . in nf <dig>  both cell line and patient samples had greatly enhanced inclusion of exon 23a, which agreed with published findings  <cit> . the results for fgfr <dig> were inconclusive since the glioma cell lines showed the expected predominant skipping of exon  <dig> compared with our normal brain control, but enhanced exon skipping was not as prominent in the patient samples. the three remaining genes  had no detectable gbm-specific splicing, consistent with their low as scores . therefore, the rt-pcr analyses on these seven published events were consistent with array-derived results except for exon 23a of nf <dig>  which was not represented by an established refseq.

low concordance with in silico studies
previous in silico studies identified at least  <dig> genes with purported glioma-specific splicing events  <cit> . figure 3b plots the array values obtained in our patient set for these genes . only  <dig> of  <dig> refseq entries had p-values <  <dig>  . most of the genes had only small changes in differential expression . low as scores suggest that the reported splicing events are infrequent, which could explain the lack of concordance among the studies. clta and tpd52l <dig> had clear, verifiable glioma-specific splicing patterns by both exon array and rt-pcr ; they were also listed in one of these reports  <cit> . mbp and ube2c had p-values <  <dig>  . however, rt-pcr analysis failed to validate the presence of a consistent glioma-specific splicing event .

expression profiling of rna processing factors
recently, upregulation of the splicing factor sf2/asf was shown to be oncogenic  <cit> . to determine changes in splicing factor expression, we also performed expression profiling on a subset of  <dig> gbm and  <dig> nontumor samples using the established u <dig> plus  <dig> expression array. overall, only  <dig> of  <dig> probe sets queried  showed significant differences  in expression levels between gbm and nontumor samples . to determine whether splice factor expression could be used as a marker of gliomagenesis, we performed an unsupervised clustering analysis. in this clustering, the samples separated into gbm and nontumor groups with the exception of a single nontumor sample . clustering of the  <dig> most differentially expressed probe sets with significant p-values representing  <dig> unique genes  is shown in figure  <dig>  the majority of these genes are not known to be associated with alternative splicing. however, three splice factors could be linked to gbm-specific splicing events having p <  <dig>  : a2bp <dig> regulates cltb, grin <dig>  mag, nf <dig> and scn8a splicing, ptb regulates cltb, gaba, grin and fgfr <dig> splicing, and cugbp <dig> regulates rasgrf <dig> splicing  <cit> .

discussion
aberrant pre-mrna splicing may be an important epigenetic factor for tumor progression. however, it is unclear how many genes are mis-spliced in a given tumor and whether aberrant expression of splice factors is responsible for their appearance. we used an exon array and designed analytical algorithms and parameters to identify gbm-specific splicing events in an unbiased manner. by plotting scores for differential expression  against those for alternative splicing  for genes and exons interrogated by the exon array, we were able to distinguish a single targeted induced splicing change in fgfr <dig> among  <dig>  refseq entries and to monitor the concomitant splicing and gene expression changes. using the same approach for comparing an extended gbm and nontumor sample set, gbm-specific splicing events of similar magnitude were not identified, which suggests that large-scale aberrant splicing in gbm are infrequent. we do not discount the fact that individual instances of dramatic changes in splicing were present; however, they were not shared by the majority of samples. the lack of events with large changes in differential exon expression led us to mine our data for splicing changes with at least a 2-fold change in probe set hybridization  and a p-value <  <dig> . in the hundreds of heatmaps examined, there were many changes indicative of the usage of alternative promoters or polyadenylation sites. however, we chose to focus on cassette exons as events that could be readily examined by rt-pcr. this led to the validation of  <dig> gbm-specific events: a2bp <dig>  appa <dig>  bcas <dig>  cacna1g, cald <dig>  clta,cltb, dync1i <dig>  kcnc <dig>  nf <dig>  rtn <dig>  sncb, tnc and tpd52l <dig>  moreover, our expression profiling analysis indicated that there were relatively few gbm-specific changes for splicing regulators. among the genes with the greatest differential expression only a2bp <dig>  cugbp <dig>  elav <dig>  mbnl <dig>  ptbp <dig> and ybx <dig>  have known functions in alternative splicing. at least three of these  could be linked to gbm-specific splicing events.

the identified and validated gbm-specific isoforms encode proteins that primarily affect cell growth and mobility. a2bp <dig>  which shows both differential expression and splicing, is a neuronal-specific splicing regulator for multiple targets  <cit> . cltb and dync1i <dig> are involved in intracellular transport and may play a role in cell migration  <cit> . four genes have clearly identified functions in the central nervous system: appa <dig> functions in notch signaling during neural development, cell adhesion and apoptosis; rtn <dig> is a neurite growth inhibitor; and sncb, which is upregulated in glial tumors, is thought to regulate phospholipase d <dig> activity. nf <dig> is believed to be a glial-cell marker and mutated in multiple cns tumors  <cit> . for the remaining genes, little is known about their function in normal brain or gliomagenesis. comparing glioblastoma and oligodendroglioma as two histological glioma subgroups on the same exon array platform that we used here, french and colleagues recently identified a total of  <dig> differentially expressed splice variants  <cit> , one of which overlapped with our validated genes  . in the exon array study for prostate and colon cancer, only cald <dig> was in common with our validated gene list  <cit> . therefore, it is unclear whether common pathways are targeted for splicing changes during tumorigenesis. it remains to be determined whether these splicing targets have a synergistic effect on gliomagenesis.

genes with glioma-predominant splice isoforms have previously been identified through global est alignments. max was the only gene found both experimentally and in silico . despite using similar datasets, the number of in silico derived genes with gbm-specific isoforms varied and only three genes were found to be shared between two of the five studies: ap2a <dig>  cpne <dig> and kpnb <dig>  <cit> . the lack of agreement between all of these studies can be explained by several technical and biological factors. first, the small sample sizes used did not allow for statistical calculations. second, sample heterogeneity affected normalization and interpretation. third, the nature of the samples being compared, which can be normal or nontumor vs. tumor, or tumor type a vs. tumor type b. for est libraries, the true splicing frequency could be masked by too few ests, normalization strategies, and/or low-stringency criteria that enriched for rare ests  <cit> . the bias towards 3' and 5' ends of transcripts could also lead to the under-representation of isoforms with internal differences  <cit> . in contrast, using a large sample set on exon arrays circumvented these problems and allowed for objective measurements of isoform frequencies. it should be noted, however, that array-based studies are limited by the quality of the target preparation, probe specificity and sensitivity, and for the affymetrix platform we used the lack of interrogation of exons <  <dig> bp., and can be confounded by tumor tissue heterogeneity. of our  <dig> validated gbm-associated splicing events, eight  were previously reported . most of the genes that were discordant had splicing changes that were outside the range of detection for the array . two additional genes  had a p-value <  <dig>  that were concordant with in silico determined genes, but could not be validated by rt-pcr . finally, the lack of complete agreement in all of these gene lists could be due to the overall low level of aberrant splicing in gbm.

many studies have shown that overexpression of a single cancer-enhancing isoform is sufficient to alter glioma cell proliferation or invasion  <cit> . what remains unclear is how these specific isoforms are produced. many cancers have over- or under-expression of splicing factors, which suggests that global aberrant splice events are possible. however, our analysis revealed that aberrant splicing factor expression does not lead to either large changes in specific exon utilization or widespread changes in the splicing of multiple targets. it is likely that titration of levels of multiple splicing factors is required to "fine tune" splicing decisions.

CONCLUSIONS
the relatively small number of aberrant pre-mrna splicing events that we observed in our gbm sample set suggests that systematic, epigenetic targeting of splicing that leads to large changes may not be an important mechanism in gliomagenesis. other exon array studies measuring tumor-specific aberrant alternative pre-mrna splicing in prostate cancer and colon cancer also support the finding that extreme splicing changes in cancer are less frequent than was suggested by in silico studies  <cit> . we found that only  <dig> of  <dig>   fully annotated refseq entries on the exon array showed significant changes in exon expression. we interpret our results to indicate that aberrant pre-mrna splicing in gbm is a low frequency event. however, this analysis does not rule out patient- or gene-specific aberrant splicing events, or smaller magnitude splicing changes with critical functions in gliomagenesis. furthermore, the differential expression of several rna processing factors not involved in alternative splicing suggests that other aspects of rna biology may play critical roles in gliomagenesis. our validation experiments indicate that gbm-specific splicing is generally a partial event, with varying degrees of exon inclusion. the  <dig> genes identified in our study are potentially the most important gbm-specific splicing events and constitute promising targets for therapeutic intervention.
