BACKGROUND
type iv secretion  systems are one of six secretion systems used to transport effector proteins or dnas through the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria. these six secretions systems can be categorised into two classes. the first class of secretion systems mediates substrate transfer from the cytosol to the extracellular milieu in one step: substrates captured from the cytosol are released extracellularly without the need for a periplasmic intermediate  <cit> . the second class encompasses a range of specialised outer membrane  secretion systems: the substrate is first transported through the inner membrane  to the periplasm via the general secabyeg secretion machinery and then uses specialised om systems for extracellular release  <cit> . t4s systems belong to the first class.

t4s systems export proteins and dna-protein complexes and fulfil a wide variety of functions, such as i- the conjugative transfer of plasmids and other mobile dna elements to bacterial recipient cells, ii- the direct uptake of dna from the extracellular milieu or iii- the delivery of protein or dna substrates to eukaryotic target cells  <cit> . t4s systems are used by several plant and human pathogens for virulence. such bacterial pathogens include agrobacterium tumefaciens, the causative agent of crown gall disease in plants, bordetella pertussis, the agent responsible for whooping cough in children, and helicobacter pylori, responsible for gastric ulcers and stomach cancer  <cit> . in addition, there are intracellular bacterial pathogens utilising t4s systems for virulence, such as brucella suis, the causative agent of brucellosis, and legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of legionnaires' disease  <cit> .

t4s systems are generally composed of  <dig> protein components forming a macromolecular assembly inserted into the bacterial cell envelope  <cit> . these proteins are named virb1-virb <dig> and vird <dig>  based on the widely used nomenclature of the model system, the a. tumefaciens virb/d <dig> t4s system. three atpases are key components of the t4s system: vird <dig>  virb <dig> and virb <dig>  virb <dig> proteins are the largest and the most evolutionarily conserved proteins in t4s systems  <cit>  but their function remains unclear. although virb <dig> proteins have clearly defined walker a and walker b motifs characteristic of atpases  <cit> , until very recently no atpase activity had been demonstrated for any virb <dig> homologues  <cit> . however, two recent studies have shown that atpase activities of virb <dig> proteins are crucially dependent on solution conditions and on the oligomerisation state of virb <dig>  <cit> . for trwk, the virb <dig> homolog encoded by the r <dig> conjugative plasmid system, rabel et al.  <cit>  initially reported that the protein exhibited no atpase activity and was monomeric. however arechaga et al.  <cit> , in a subsequent study, reported an atpase activity of trwk in the presence of acetate ions, possibly due to a small proportion of an hexameric form of the protein. trab, the virb <dig> homolog encoded by the pkm <dig> conjugative plasmid system, also exhibits atpase activity in the presence of acetate ions and is primarily hexameric under these solution conditions  <cit> . interestingly, trab partitions between the cytosol and the inner membrane, and the membrane-extracted form does not exhibit atpase activity, even in the presence of acetate ions  <cit> . this membrane-extracted form of trab was also shown to be dimeric. it was concluded that cytosolic trab is in equilibrium between a dimeric form that binds dna and nucleotides, but is unable to hydrolyze atp, and an acetate-induced hexameric form able to hydrolyse atp. trab purified from the membrane is in the dimeric form, and is unable to transition to the hexameric form even in the presence of acetate ions  <cit> . interestingly, a. tumefaciens virb <dig> was also shown to form active dimers in vivo  <cit> , strongly supporting a functional role of this dimer, besides the hexameric form.

the structure of virb <dig> proteins is still unknown, as they have resisted extensive crystallisation efforts either in the hexameric or the dimeric form. attempts at visualising acetate-induced hexameric trab by negative stained electron microscopy or small-angle x-ray scattering have failed  <cit> . recently, based on sequence similarities with trwb , the a. tumefaciens virb <dig> c-terminal domain was modelled, as an homo-hexameric ring  <cit>  much like virb <dig> and vird <dig>  <cit> . however no structural experimental data has yet backed this model, most probably because it has been impossible so far to stabilise and isolate the hexameric form of virb <dig>  here we report the low resolution structure of the membrane-extracted dimeric form of trab, using small-angle x-ray scattering . we also performed a saxs analysis of the n-terminal  and c-terminal  domains of trab, and of the full-length monomeric lvhb <dig>  the virb <dig> homolog from the l. pneumophila t4s system, which represents the first in vitro study of a member of the l. pneumophila lvh t4s system. altogether, our results provide the first insights into the architecture of the highly conserved virb <dig> family of proteins.

RESULTS
purification of trab domains and lvhb4
based on sequence homology between the c-terminal domain of trab and the protein trwb, the e. coli r388-encoded vird <dig> homolog, we previously established that trab can be divided into two folded domains : a c-terminal domain , which is soluble, and an n-terminal domain , which partitions between a soluble form in the cytosol and a membrane-bound form  <cit> . these two domains are functional as they are each able to bind dna and atp  <cit> . full-length trab  was subsequently found to partition between a soluble and membrane-bound form  <cit> . various transmembrane domains predictors were used to screen the sequence of trab . the predictions were not fully consistent, except for one stretch that was predicted by two out of the  <dig> different predictors, between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  this suggests the existence of a transmembrane  segment in trab, or of a hydrophobic patch through which trab might be associated with the membrane.

for this study, trabfl and trabnt were both purified from the membrane fraction, while trabct, which is soluble and does not partition in the membrane, was purified from the soluble fraction. for comparison, we cloned, expressed and purified the full-length lvhb <dig>  the virb <dig> homolog from the l. pneumophila t4s system, for which no predicted tm domain was found. indeed, lvhb <dig> purifies from the soluble fraction and not from the membrane fraction, demonstrating that the protein is not located in the membrane. all four proteins were purified to homogeneity using the same two-step purification strategy . in sds-page the proteins migrate at their expected molecular mass:  <dig> kda for trabfl,  <dig> kda for trabnt,  <dig> kda for trabct, and  <dig> kda for lvhb <dig> .

size determination of trab domains and lvhb4
we investigated the oligomeric state of all four proteins in the gfsol  and gfmb  buffer conditions . table  <dig> summarizes the results obtained by gel filtration, dynamic light scattering and native-gel electrophoresis. the calibration of the gel filtration column  allowed us to evaluate the apparent molecular mass of the proteins according to their elution volume. trabfl ran as a  <dig>  kda protein, trabnt as a  <dig>  kda protein, trabct as a  <dig> kda protein, and lvhb <dig> as a  <dig>  kda protein. by comparison with the calculated molecular mass obtained from the amino acid sequence, we concluded that trabfl, trabnt and trabct were all forming dimers under the examined buffer conditions. in contrast, lvhb <dig> behaved as a monomer in the same conditions. dls and blue-native page  confirmed these results for trabfl and trabct . in conclusion, all trab-derived constructs form only dimers in solution, whereas lvhb <dig> forms monomers.

all mm are given in kda. "mmcalc" is the mm calculated from the amino-acid sequence, "gf" stands for gel filtration, "dls" stands for dynamic light scattering, "bn-page" stands for blue native-page. the oligomeric state is deduced from the comparison between mmcalc and the experimental mm as determined by the other approaches. "nd" stands for non-determined.

overall saxs parameters
small-angle x-ray scattering  studies yield information on the size and shape of macromolecules in solution, and also on the oligomerisation state of macromolecules. the overall dimensions of a protein can be evaluated by its radius of gyration, rg, while the molecular mass of the scattering particle is inferred from the forward scattering intensity, i, both derived from the guinier law . the scattering curves of all the constructs followed the guinier law very well  and did not display any sign of aggregation in solution. we determined the molecular mass of each construct of trab from their experimental i and obtained  <dig> kda for trabfl,  <dig> kda for trabnt, and  <dig> kda for trabct . after comparison with the expected molecular mass of the monomer of each trab-derived constructs we concluded that all of them were dimers under the examined solution conditions . for trabfl and trabnt, the molecular masses inferred from the forward scattering intensity are very similar to the theoretical molecular masses calculated from their sequence. this strongly suggests that very few detergent molecules are bound to the proteins, and therefore that the contribution of the detergents to the scattering intensity can be considered as negligible. lvhb <dig> was confirmed to be a monomer with a molecular mass experimentally calculated to be  <dig> kda, very close to the expected monomer size of  <dig> kda. the i determination of the molecular mass of all four proteins were consistent with our biochemical results and confirmed their oligomeric states. these results suggest that both the n- and c-terminal halves of trab participate in the dimer interface of the full-length protein.

mmcalc: theoretical molecular mass calculated from amino acid sequence. mmexp: experimentally based molecular mass calculated from the scattering intensity extrapolated at zero angles i. o.s: oligomeric state, as determined by comparison between the mmcalc and the mmexp. rg*: radius of gyration, estimated from the guinier plots. rg**: radius of gyration, estimated using the program gnom. v: volume of the envelope calculated by ab initio modelling. chiexp: discrepancy between the experimental saxs profile and the fit for each model calculated by the program gasbor. the ratios of the molecular masses and of the volumes between different constructs are given in the last two lines.

the radii of gyration measured on the different constructs are summarized in table  <dig>  surprisingly, trabfl and trabnt have similar radii of gyration , in spite of the molecular mass of trabnt being half of that of trabfl. in contrast, the radii of gyration of trabct and lvhb <dig> are smaller . proteins of similar radius of gyration may have very different shape and mass depending on their structure. thus, trabfl and trabnt may have similar rg values but different structures. according to the saxs results, trabct and consequently trabfl are on average more compact than trabnt. the rg of trabnt reflects a less compact structure with a lower molecular mass, whereas, the rg of trabfl results from a more compact structure and higher molecular mass, these two parameters counter-balancing each other to yield similar rg values.

we then calculated the pair-distance distribution function, p, from the saxs curves . the p functions for all four constructs exhibited a bell-shaped curve with a slightly extended profile for the higher distances , indicating a globular but somewhat elongated conformation. the comparison of the values obtained for the radius of gyration  and for the maximum dimension  for the four proteins gives an idea of their anisotropy. to obtain an estimation of the anisotropy of the protein, we calculated the ratio between rg and dmax values for each construct. in the case of a sphere, this ratio is equal to  <dig> , as the radius of a sphere is equal to 1/2r, where r is the radius of the sphere. table  <dig> summarizes the values computed for all the constructs. the ratio rg/dmax is  <dig>  for trabfl,  <dig>  for trabnt,  <dig>  for trabct and  <dig>  for lvhb <dig>  significantly different than the value for a sphere, considering the error bars measured on the rg and dmax. interestingly, despite having different sizes, all four constructs exhibit the same anisotropy , indicating that the proteins are rather anisotropic, and thus elongated.

low resolution shapes from ab initio modeling
the overall shapes of the four proteins were computed from the saxs profiles using the program gasbor  <cit> . for all trab derived constructs , we used an imposed 2-fold symmetry axis  for generating the reconstructed models, in agreement with the oligomerisation state inferred from the biochemical data and from the forward scattering intensity i. similar shapes were also obtained without imposing any symmetry . for lvhb <dig>  no symmetry was imposed to reconstruct the 3d-volume. several independent calculations provided highly reproducible results, with very similar models, and fit to the data of similar quality. the average shapes calculated from repeated, multiple modelling processes  give each time a shape similar to the best individual model, defined by the lowest chiexp value. figure  <dig> shows that the fit to the experimental data of these shapes for all four proteins is very good, as confirmed by the value of chiexp . the very reproducible shapes together with the very low chiexp, obtained when fitting the data  give good confidence that the inferred model is not an artifact due to the saxs intrinsic degeneracy and that these shapes are reliable. we decided to use the best model for each construct as representative of their low resolution structure in solution. overall, the shapes of the four proteins appear to be globular but rather elongated , as expected from the rg/dmax ratio. trabfl presents two symmetrical lobes with two distinctive protruding ends, with each lobe being potentially attributable to one trabfl monomer in the dimeric assembly . on the other hand, the shapes of both trabnt  and trabct  appeared to be rather flat and elongated with few protruding extensions. the symmetrical 2-fold axis separating the two monomers is however clearly visible in the reconstructed volumes, even without imposing any symmetry . interestingly, the low-resolution structure of lvhb <dig>  shows an asymmetrical and compact, yet rather extended conformation.

superposition and comparison of the trab derived models
trabnt and trabct represent the n- and c-terminal halves of trabfl, respectively . thus, given that all the three trab-derived constructs are dimeric, the sum of the reconstructed volumes of both trabnt and trabct should give a value similar to the volume of trabfl. we used the program crysol  <cit>  to evaluate the volume of the reconstructed models . we found that the sum of the volumes of trabnt and trabct gives a value very close to the volume of trabfl . we then manually superimposed the shapes of trabnt and trabct onto the shape of trabfl. several respective orientations of trabnt and trabct were tested and for only one orientation the trabnt and trabct models fit well together into the trabfl model without any clash . in the proposed trabfl model, the longest dimension of trabnt and trabct are 45° apart, with the longest dimension of trabnt coinciding with that of the trabfl dimer. in this model, the more compact structure of trabct lays onto the more elongated structure of trabnt . two schemes for the location of the trab monomer and its two domains can be inferred from these saxs envelopes of trabfl and trab fragments . in one scheme , each trab monomer is positioned on either side of an axis perpendicular to the long axis of the trab dimer. in the other scheme , each trab monomer is positioned on each side of the long trab dimer axis.

comparison between trabfl and lvhb <dig> and orientation of the trab monomers
virb <dig> proteins are the most conserved components  of the t4s systems. it was then logical to think that virb <dig> proteins could have a similar shape, albeit with different oligomeric states. we thus hypothesised that if trabfl and lvhb <dig> monomers  share a similar overall tertiary structure, the latter could help us localise trabfl monomers in the dimeric model. the ratio between the volumes of two lvhb <dig> monomers and one dimeric trabfl is of the same order as the ratio of their molecular masses, with lvhb <dig> slightly smaller than trabfl monomers . therefore, we tried to manually fit two lvhb <dig> monomers into the envelope of the trabfl dimer. figure  <dig> shows the results obtained with two possible orientations: orientation  <dig>  with each of the lvhb <dig> monomer being on each side of an axis perpendicular to the trabfl dimer longest axis; and orientation  <dig>  with each lvhb <dig> monomer being on each side of the longest axis of the trabfl dimer. in figure 6b and 6d, we have superimposed the schematic diagrams of figure 5d and 5e, respectively. in both orientations, there remains empty spaces in the trabfl dimer, not filled by two lvhb <dig> monomers. in the case of orientation  <dig>  this empty space is localized in between the two monomers. this is not in agreement with the evidence of a stable trabfl dimer and with the fact that both the n- and c-terminal domains have been also isolated as dimers. conversely, in the case of orientation  <dig>  this empty space is localized at the n-terminal ends of lvhb <dig>  this is consistent with the shorter n-terminal domain of lvhb <dig> compared to trab and subsequently with the smaller volume of the lvhb <dig> model compared to the corresponding volume of the trabfl monomer . in addition, the contact areas between the two n-terminal domains and the two c-terminal domains are larger, allowing formation of stable trabfl, trabnt and trabct dimers . in conclusion, we favor orientation  <dig> as best describing the possible arrangement of the trabfl monomers into the dimeric model.

comparison between trabct model and the homology-based structure of at-virb4
as mentioned previously, middleton et al.  <cit>  have modeled the structure of the c-terminal domain of the a. tumefaciens virb <dig>  based on the sequence homology with the vird <dig> protein trwb from the r <dig> conjugation machinery. since trab and at-virb <dig> are highly homologous, we used this at-virb4-cter model and tried to fit two of them into the trabct dimeric shape. indeed, as shown in figure  <dig> , we could manually fit the two at-virb4-cter models into the trabct dimer volume. the two at-virb4-cter subunits are arranged according to the two-fold symmetry axis of the trabct dimer. as shown in figure 7a, this docking identifies the c-terminal end of trab as participating in the dimer interface. similarly, we superimposed the at-virb4-cter model with the saxs envelope of lvhb <dig> . from this comparison we propose that the c-terminal domain of lvhb <dig> is possibly localised at the wider end of the curved shape, opposite to the narrow end. the empty space in the superimposition would consequently be the n-terminal domain of lvhb <dig>  this orientation fits well with the models presented in figure 6c and 6d, showing the superimposition of two lvhb <dig> monomers into the trabfl dimeric model.

discussion
the saxs experiments reported here confirm that trab and its n- and c-terminal domains are dimeric in the acetate-free solution conditions under which the experiments were conducted, indicating that both domains participate in the dimer interface. the structures of the two domains revealed elongated shapes, which in the full-length protein come together at a 45° angle. the superposition of the lvhb <dig> structure could resolve the ambiguity as to where the trab monomer lies, and favored dimer  <dig> , where the monomer would extend along the long axis of the dimer structure. indeed, in the superimpositions of the two lvhb <dig> monomers onto the trabfl dimer structure presented in figure 6b and 6d, only the one aligning the lvhb <dig> monomers along the long axis of the trab structure gives rise to an extended dimer interface. the configuration in figure 5d  would be expected to yield a less stable dimer than is observed. also, a more extended conformation of trab is consistent with our observation that trab is susceptible to proteolysis and that limited proteolysis of trab very rapidly yields trabct .

virb <dig> is a family of very conserved proteins that are essential components of t4s systems  <cit>  however, recent biochemical studies have revealed that this family of proteins is more diverse than originally expected  <cit> . for example, their oligomerisation state appears different depending on the system under investigation and the conditions under which they are studied. trab has been shown to be in equilibrium between two oligomeric states, dimer and hexamer, dependent on the solution conditions, namely the presence or absence of acetate ion  <cit> . trwk appears to transition between a major monomeric form and minor hexameric form  <cit> . the virb <dig> homolog encoded by the cag pathogenicity island in h. pylori appears to be monomeric  <cit>  and we show here that, under the solution conditions examined, the virb <dig> homolog from l. pneumophila lvhb <dig> is monomeric. hexamer formation appears to be required for atp-hydrolyzing activity: indeed only hexameric forms of virb <dig> homologs have been shown to exhibit atpase activity  <cit> . so far, only sparse information has been gathered about the function of the dimeric trab. we recently reported its dna and nucleotide binding activities  <cit> , while a. tumefaciens virb <dig> was shown to direct dimer formation when fused to the n-terminal portion of the ci repressor protein  <cit> . the different subcellular localisation of trab together with the recent characterization of a degenerated nucleotide binding site in its n-terminal domain  <cit>  are features also observed in the seca translocase, perhaps suggesting an evolutionary relationship between the two protein families  <cit> . finally, trab in the context of the entire t4s machinery might interact with different partners. indeed, its close association with traa  or its documented protein-protein interactions with other t4s system components could induce the conformational changes necessary to reshape the active site or radically change its cell environment more specifically, in order to stabilise an active dimeric membrane-bound form.

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here provides the first structural glimpse of a protein which is crucial to type iv secretion but has until now resisted x-ray crystallography or em structural characterisation. it uncovers a modular structure that comes together in an extended dimer interface where the domains appear to "hug" each other. the dimers corresponding to each domain could easily be put together in the envelope of the full length protein and the structural model for lvhb <dig> helps suggest a potential model for the full-length protein. intriguingly, the predicted tm segment locates within the n-terminal domain, not at the boundaries of the domain structure. this raises topological issues that can be resolved by a model invoking an orientation of the trabnt domain facing the cytosolic side of the inner membrane, while the trabct domain would lie in the cytoplasm. this would be consistent with trab being only superficially associated with the membrane, and therefore being able to partition between the membrane and the cytoplasm. it is also consistent with the dimeric structure proposed here. docking of the trwb protein  within the envelope of the trabct provides further structural details. finally, the dimeric model of trab observed here suggests that there might be structural rearrangements required to fit the virb <dig> dimeric structure into the 14-fold symmetrical core complex recently unravelled by the high resolution em structure of the virb7-virb9-virb <dig> complex  <cit>  and confirmed by the subsequent crystal structure of its outer membrane-inserting part  <cit> . further studies will seek to elucidate the crystal structure of a virb <dig> protein and also to visualize a complex of virb <dig> bound to the core complex.
