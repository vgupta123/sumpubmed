BACKGROUND
the enormous impact of horizontal gene transfer  on the evolution of bacterial species has only been recognized during the past years  <cit> . among the mobile genetic elements involved in hgt genomic islands are of particular relevance since they can comprise large genomic regions encoding accessory factors required by the bacteria to thrive in specific environments. for example, many virulence related factors of pathogenic bacteria are encoded on so-called pathogenicity islands, while metabolic islands frequently encode factors required for detoxification of poisonous compounds or for the utilization of specific carbon sources such as aromatic compounds  <cit> .

the genus bordetella harbours several important pathogens infecting humans and various animals. while b. pertussis and b. parapertussis are etiological agents of whooping cough in man, b. bronchiseptica and b. avium can cause respiratory infections in various mammalian species and birds, respectively  <cit> . b. petrii was the first bordetella species isolated from the environment, while all other bordetella species so far could only be found in obligate association with host organisms  <cit> . phylogenetically, b. petrii appears to be closely related to a common ancestor of the pathogenic bordetellae and links the genus with other environmental bacteria of the genera achromobacter and alcaligenes  <cit> . b. petrii was repeatedly isolated from contaminated soil  <cit> . however, recently, several isolates from clinical specimens associated with bone degenerative disease or cystic fibrosis were found to be closely related to b. petrii, although the underlying etiology is not clear in any of the cases  <cit> . the pathogenic bordetellae encode a multitude of virulence factors including several toxins and adhesins  <cit> . the evolutionary origin of these factors is unclear, since in contrast to many virulence genes of other pathogens they are not located on mobile genetic elements such as pathogenicity islands or prophages. in fact, so far only few presumptive horizontal gene transfer events are known among the pathogenic members of the genus, e.g. a  <dig> kb island encoding iron transport genes that presumably has been exchanged between b. pertussis and b. holmesii, a pathogenic species mainly found in immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . a prevalent feature in the evolution of virulence in this genus is reductive genome evolution, since strains specialized on particular host organisms such as the exclusive human pathogen b. pertussis have presumably evolved from a b. bronchiseptica-like ancestor. specialization to a single host was accompanied by a massive genome size reduction. in agreement with this assumption, b. pertussis harbors numerous pseudogenes and virtually all b. pertussis genes have counterparts in b. bronchiseptica  <cit> .

in contrast to b. bronchiseptica, b. petrii has a highly mosaic genome harbouring numerous mobile elements including genomic islands, prophages and insertion elements. these mobile elements comprise about 22% of the entire genome  <cit> . most of the seven putative genomic islands found in b. petrii exhibit typical features of such islands such as a low gc content, the presence of integrase genes, conjugal transfer functions, and integration at trna loci . there are four elements  which strongly resemble the iceclc of pseudomonas knackmussii sp. train b <dig>  a self transmissible element encoding factors for the degradation of chloroaromatic compounds  <cit> . the bordetella islands exhibit a high similarity with the iceclc in particular in a core region comprising a highly similar integrase and genes involved in conjugal transfer  <cit> . like the iceclc the b. petrii elements are characterized by the insertion into trnagly genes and by direct repeats formed at the insertion site  <cit> . the b. petrii islands encode factors required for degradation of a variety of aromatic compounds, or multi drug efflux pumps and iron transport functions  <cit> .

the remaining genomic islands, gi <dig>  gi <dig>  and gi <dig>  encode type iv secretion systems probably involved in conjugal transfer  <cit> . gi <dig> has very pronounced similarities with tn <dig> of ralstonia oxalatica and other bacteria including achromobacter georgiopolitanum and encodes metabolic functions involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds  <cit> . gi <dig> and gi <dig> encode a phage p <dig> related integrase and genes involved in metabolism of aromatic compounds or in detoxification of heavy metals. finally, there is a region on the b. petrii genome  which is characterized by a low gc content, but does not have other characteristic features of a genomic island thus possibly being a remnant of a former mobile element. gi encodes metabolic functions for the degradation of phthalate and protocatechuate  <cit> .

in the present study we characterize these putative genomic islands and show that most of them are in fact active, at least in terms of excision from the chromosome. we show that these elements are responsible for the genomic instability of b. petrii observed during long term growth in vitro.

RESULTS
long term survival of b. petrii in river water and appearance of phenotypic variants
b. petrii was the first bordetella species isolated from the environment, i.e. from a river sediment. the analysis of its survival capacity in river water revealed a high survival rate and nearly no decay in viability during a period of  <dig> weeks, while under the same experimental conditions viability of a b. bronchiseptica strain declined rapidly and no viable bacteria could be detected in the water samples after about three weeks . the short survival time of b. bronchiseptica is somewhat surprising, since in a previous study it was shown to persist for more than  <dig> weeks in lake water  <cit> . a possible explanation for this may be that different b. bronchiseptica strains were used in these studies. however, the direct comparison of b. bronchiseptica and b. petrii demonstrates that b. petrii has a much more pronounced capacity to survive in river water for a prolonged time period which is in agreement with its original isolation from river sediment. interestingly, after about  <dig> days of the survival experiment stable phenotypic variants of b. petrii with differing colony morphology regarding colour and colony size appeared when the bacteria were plated on lb agar plates . in this study, three of these variants  were further characterized. all of these variants showed virtually identical growth characteristics at 37°c in liquid lb medium, while two of them  showed a markedly impaired growth capacity at 15°c as compared to the wild type strain and to variant g .

genome rearrangements involving the genomic islands of b. petrii
in a previous study we have reported about the spontaneous loss of a huge part comprising more than  <dig> kb of the genome of b. petrii during in vitro culture correlating with the presence of several genomic islands   <cit> . to investigate whether the frequent appearance of phenotypic variants of b. petrii is in fact correlated with the various genomic islands, we started to characterize the three variants described above by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. figure  <dig> shows that after bcui digestion each of the three variants lack three large bands as compared to the wild type, but they have an identical restriction pattern among each other. to identify those regions of the variants lacking as compared to the wild type we performed hybridization studies with a b. petrii dna-whole genome microarray. the results presented in table  <dig> show that in all three variants the same genes are missing and that the deleted regions correspond to the clc-like elements gi <dig>  gi <dig>  and gi <dig> and to the island gi <dig>  this shows that during in vitro culture these four elements have been lost in the three variants. it is surprising that all three variants exhibit identical genomic variation, since, as mentioned above, they have different growth characteristics at 15°c and colony morphology. therefore, additional mutation must have occurred which did not involve large deletions detectable by the array experiments.

the comparison of the deleted genes of the variants with those which according to the annotation are encoded on the gis revealed a perfect congruence of the predicted island borders and the microarray data in the case of gi <dig>  while the extent of the deletions and therefore the sizes of these elements differed from the bioinformatic prediction in the case of gi <dig>  gi <dig> and gi <dig>  <cit> . according to these data, gi <dig> appears to comprise additional  <dig> genes , gi <dig> additional  <dig> genes , and gi <dig> appears to lack one gene  . these data were further corroborated by a series of southern blot experiments with probes specific for the respective genes, the results of which matched perfectly with the microarray data .

definition of the borders of the genomic islands of b. petrii
integrative and conjugative elements  are known to be self transmissible genomic islands and their excision is mediated by the recombination between the left and right end repeats leading to a circular intermediate and the integration by the recombination between the attachment site on the chromosome  and the conserved attachment site  on the circular element  <cit> . to determine the exact borders of the gis and to detect circular intermediates occurring after excision of the elements we used a pcr based approach. for the detection of excised circular intermediates of the various gis, a series of oligonucleotide primers was designed from the presumable ends of the respective elements which are supposed to join during circularization. in the case of the adjacent elements gi <dig>  gi <dig> and gi <dig> we considered that also various combinations might occur by common excision events of these adjacent islands . the direct repeats flanking the various clc-like elements of b. petrii are shown in figure  <dig> 

for gi <dig> we obtained a pcr product demonstrating the involvement of the direct repeats directly flanking the island at sequence positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  since gi <dig> is not directly associated with a trna gene it appears likely that it has integrated in the left repeat of gi <dig> at sequence position  <dig> , <dig>  which was generated by the previous insertion of gi <dig> in the respective trna gene . for gi <dig> we obtained the expected data which also correspond to the microarray results described above. moreover, we obtained evidence that the clc-like elements gi1–gi <dig> can excise together in different combinations: gi2–gi <dig> and gi1–gi2–gi <dig>  therefore, these islands appear to be able to excise independently from each other, but also in various combinations thereby potentially forming composed transmissible elements. in the case of the fourth clc-like element, gi <dig>  the microarray data revealed the presence of the bpet <dig> gene in the chromosome even after excision of the element. this is surprising, since the direct repeat sequence which should be the target for the gi <dig> integrase lies beyond this gene. thus, the bpet <dig> gene should be located within the excised region. curiously, the pcr experiments aiming in the detection of circular intermediates showed that the bpet <dig> gene is also part of the circular excised form of this element. this suggests a duplication of the bpet <dig> gene during excision by an unknown mechanism.

in the case of gi <dig> and gi <dig> we obtained pcr products providing evidence for excised circular intermediates which perfectly match the previous bioinformatical predictions based on the detailed sequence analysis about the size of these islands. in contrast, in case of gi <dig> we were not able to detect a circular intermediate neither with the originally predicted borders nor with the additional genes suggested by the microarray experiments , although the microarray data of the phenotypic variants f, g, and k definitely revealed the deletion of this element from their genomes.

as shown above, we were able to detect circular intermediates of most genomic islands by pcr amplification, although the microarray experiments with the phenotypic variants clearly demonstrated the deletion events. possible explanations for this fact could be that the excised islands are diluted during growth of the bacteria since they cannot replicate. moreover, the experimental protocols for the two methods are different and pcr amplification is much more sensitive as compared to cy3/cy <dig> labeling by klenow polymerisation.

stability of genomic island gi3
the frequent appearance of phenotypic variants involving the genomic islands present in the b. petrii genome and the detection of circular intermediates of these islands under standard growth conditions indicates that these genomic islands are rather unstable and active at least in terms of excision. to assess the stability of one of these islands  by homologous recombination we integrated a tetracycline resistance cassette in gi <dig> between the genes bpet <dig> and bpet <dig> coding for a putative transposase and a glycosyltransferase, respectively. under standard growth conditions, the resulting strain b. petrii gi3::tetr did not show any change in its maximum specific growth rate as compared to the wild type . this strain was then used for growth experiments without selective pressure in which the bacteria were cultivated for about  <dig> consecutive generations. exponentially growing b. petrii has a generation time of about  <dig> min . figure  <dig> shows the time course of loss of gi3::tetr determined by differential counting of tetracycline resistant and sensitive bacteria plated out on the respective agar plates. gi <dig> was stably present in the b. petrii population for about  <dig> generations, then the proportion of tetracycline resistant bacteria declined steadily and virtually no tetracycline resistant bacteria were found in the population after about  <dig> generations. lack of the entire gi <dig> was confirmed by southern blotting in representatives of these bacteria . although we cannot exclude a destabilizing effect of the tetracycline cassette on the island, it is likely that gi <dig> is highly unstable and gets lost with a high incidence when no selective pressure for its persistence is present.

transfer of genomic island gi <dig> to bordetella bronchiseptica
in the case of the iceclc self transmission to a variety of β- and γ-proteobacteria was observed  <cit> . since the clc-like element gi <dig> is active at least in terms of excision from the chromosome, we investigated its capacity to transfer itself to another host. therefore, the above described b. petrii gi3::tetr strain carrying a tetracycline resistance gene in gi <dig> was used for conjugation experiments with b. bronchiseptica. as a recipient b. bronchiseptica ps <dig> was used which carries a tnphoa insertion in the genome conferring kanamycin resistance  <cit> . transconjugants were selected by their resistance against kanamycin and tetracycline. two transconjugants were isolated and further characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis after restriction of the genomic dna with bcui. both strains showed two additional bands of the same size, which is in agreement with the fact that the only bcui restriction site in gi3::tetr is located in the tetracycline gene cassette . to identify the integration site of gi3::tetr in ps <dig> we used a pcr based approach. since clc-like elements are known to preferentially integrate in genes coding for trnagly we designed oligonucleotides to amplify the four trnagly genes present in b. bronchiseptica. for three out of the four trna genes we obtained pcr products of the expected size. only in the case of the bbt <dig> gene no pcr product was obtained suggesting the integration of gi3::tetr in this trna gene . to identifiy the exact insertion site we used primers gi3- <dig> and gi3- <dig> from the two ends of gi3::tetr and designed additional primers  from the neighbouring sequences of the bbt <dig> gene. as expected, using the primer pairs gi3-2/trna45- <dig> and gi3-1/trna45- <dig> we obtained two pcr products of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. sequence analysis of these products confirms the integration of gi3::tetr in the bbt <dig> gene and reveals the duplication of the last  <dig> bp of the trnagly gene and an inverted repeat sequence in the direct neighbourhood. the duplicated sequence is identical with the direct repeats in b. petrii flanking gi <dig> on both sides and gi <dig> on the right side . similarily, the inverted repeat sequence in the proximity of the integration site in b. bronchiseptica resembles inverted repeat sequences associated with the integration sites of ice-gi <dig> of b. petrii and iceclc in pseudomonas knackmussii sp. strain b <dig>  <cit> . the fact that gi <dig> can actively excise and reintegrate into the genome of a recipient strain proves this island to be a functional integrative and conjugative element and therefore it should be renamed ice-gi <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here underline the previous notion of a highly mosaic genome of b. petrii. by microarray analysis of spontaneous phenotypic variants of b. petrii and by direct detection of excised circular intermediates of the b. petrii gis we show that all of them are active at least in terms of excision. we provide evidence that the adjacent integration of highly related elements may enable these elements to pick up additional genomic material placed between the integration sites thereby leading to an increase in the size of the islands. moreover, the adjacent placement of islands encoding highly similar integrases and attachment sites may also lead to the formation of novel huge composite islands. for ice-gi <dig> we show that without selective pressure this island is lost from the bacterial population. moreover, we show that this island is self transmissible and can be transferred to another bordetella species, b. bronchiseptica. therefore, the evolution of b. petrii involved massive horiztonal gene transfer, while in the classical pathogenic bordetella species only very few examples of hgt have been reported, e.g. the horizontal transfer of insertion elements, the acquisition of an genomic region encoding an iron uptake system in b. holmesii and, possibly, the inactivation of the genes encoding adenylate cyclase toxin in a specific b. bronchiseptica lineage by a horizontally acquired gene cluster encoding peptide transport genes  <cit> . this may indicate that their unique habitat due to an obligate host association has dramatically limited the impact on horizontal gene transfer for the pathogenic bordetellae once they had acquired their capacity to infect and to persist exclusively in vertebrate hosts.
