BACKGROUND
as the central intermediate between transcription and translation of eukaryotic genes, the splicing of precursors to messenger rnas  in the nucleus is frequently variable and produces multiple alternatively spliced  mrna isoforms. the recognition of authentic pre-mrna splice sites out of many possible pseudo-sites, the precise excision of introns, and the ligation of exons to produce a correct message are catalyzed by a large ribonucleoprotein  complex known as the spliceosome, which is composed of several small rnps and perhaps over two-hundred proteins  <cit> . splice sites mark the boundaries between exon and intron: a 5'-splice site  at the terminus of the exon/beginning of the intron and a 3'ss  at the terminus of the intron/beginning of the exon. in addition, introns contain a branch point signal, typically  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the 3'ss. during later stages of spliceosome assembly, there are mediated interactions between the 5'ss and 3'ss, as well as splicing factors that recognize them, and a basic distinction is made between the pairing of splice sites across the exon  or the intron   <cit> . in humans, with compact exons  and comparatively much larger introns, exon-definition is thought to be the prevalent mode of rna splicing. when a pair of closely spaced 3'ss-5'ss signals is recognized, the exon is roughly defined by interactions between u <dig> snrnp:3'ss, u <dig> snrnp:5'ss as well as additional splicing factors, including u2af65:branch site and u2af35:poly- site interactions.

as events are categorized according to their splice site choice and one can distinguish four canonical types: exon-skipping , in which mrna isoforms differ by the inclusion/exclusion of an exon; alternative 5'ss exon  or alternative 3'ss exon , in which isoforms differ in the usage of a 5'ss or 3'ss, respectively; and retention-type intron , in which isoforms differ by the presence/absence of an unspliced intron  <cit> . these types are not necessarily mutually exclusive and more complex types of as events can be constructed from such canonical types. alternative splicing produces similar, yet different messages from one gene locus, thus enabling the diversification of protein sequences and function  <cit> . in addition, as holds the possibility to control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level via the non-sense mediated mrna decay  pathway. to prevent aberrantly or deliberately incorrectly spliced transcripts that prematurely terminate translation, nmd ensures that only correctly spliced mrnas that contain the full  message are subsequently utilized for protein synthesis. therefore, nmd scans newly synthesized mrna for the presence of one or more premature-termination codons , and, if detected, can selectively degrade defective mrnas  <cit> .

fostered by the abundant accumulation of complementary dna  sequences and expressed sequence tags , genome-wide computational studies of as have investigated its scope in metazoans and estimated that a fraction of up to two-thirds of human genes are predicted to encode or regulate protein synthesis via such pathways  <cit> . the outcome of these approaches have shown ses as the most frequent as event in mrna isoforms in human and other mammalian organ systems and cell types, followed by a3es and a5es, in turn followed by ris  <cit> . interestingly, the sequence information of ses and their flanking regions, and the phylogenetic conservation of such information, is sufficient to discriminate constitutive exons from ses and can be used in computational models to start predicting as events that have not yet been uncovered by cdna and est analyses  <cit> .

compared with the skipping of about one hundred exon nucleotides or the retention of several hundred intron nucleotides, a3es and a5es are thought to create more subtle changes, by affecting the choice of the 3'ss or 5'ss, respectively. here, splice site usage gives rise to two types of exon segments – the 'core' common to both splice forms and the 'extension' that is present in only the longer isoform. both types of as events have been shown to play decisive roles during development , but also in human disease . a3es and a5es are thought to be regulated by splicing-regulatory elements in exons and nearby exon-flanking regions, as well as trans-acting antagonistic splicing factors, which bind them and affect the choice of splice sites in a concentration dependent manner  <cit> . interestingly, computational studies showed that for both a3es and a5es the distribution of extensions, f, is markedly skewed toward short-range splice forms  <cit> . in particular, alternative splice sites that are separated by the three-nucleotide long motif nag/nag/ make up a predominant proportion of a3e events in a mammals, extending to invertebrates and plants  <cit> . yet additional support from experimental studies is still very sparse, and the similarities and dissimilarities of overlapping against non-overlapping  as well as constitutive splice sites remain to be delineated.

here, we describe an effort to compare and contrast a5e, a3e, and constitutive splice sites of human exons derived from transcript sequences, of different human organ systems and cell types, which were aligned to the assembled human genome sequence. to study known sequence features involved in the recognition and distinction of splice sites, we performed large-scale but stringent alignments of cdnas and ests to the human and mouse genome. subsequently, we experimentally validated a subset of computationally inferred patterns of overlapping as patterns, by rt-pcr and direct sequencing, analyzed implicated sequence and transcript features, and compared a5es with constitutive and pseudo-exons, as well as a3es, in h. sapiens and m. musculus. we found differences for sequence conservation and base-pairing to u <dig> snrna, proximal/distal splice site utilization, occurrence of candidate motifs, and transcript coverage in subsets of overlapping 5'ss.

our results distinguish a small but authentic enriched set of a5es , with specific distances between proximal and distal 5'ss , which show a marked dichotomy between the levels of in- and out-of-frame tandem splice site usage, identify a number of candidate nmd targets, and allow the rough estimation of a number of unobserved tandem as events based on splice site information. the implications for the processing of human alternative transcripts are discussed.

RESULTS
biased extensions of alternative 5'ss and 3'ss exons
exon-skipping is the most prevalent as type produced by the human spliceosome, as well as by all other mammals investigated to date, when averaged across different organ systems and cell types that can exhibit tissue-enriched splice forms  <cit> . internal alternative exons that involve exclusively either the 3'ss  or the 5'ss  are also abundantly produced, while the simultaneous alteration of 3'ss and 5'ss  are markedly less frequent. for a5es the most distal splice site defines the exon core, while proximal sites  are exon extensions only included in selected mrnas.

out of a collection of ~ <dig>  transcript-inferred human alternative exons maintained in the hollywood database  <cit> , as events of about  <dig>  a5es and  <dig>  a3es were filtered for exon splice variants of solely one proximal/one distal 5'ss, while being constitutively spliced at the opposite site, and resulted to  <dig>  a5es and  <dig>  a3es; either exon set had no other inferred as type, respectively. stringent alignment criteria were imposed on all transcripts: 1) ests were required to overlap at least one co-aligned cdna; 2) the first and last aligned segments of ests were required to be at least  <dig> nucleotides in length with 90% sequence identity; 3) the entire est sequence alignment was required to extend over at least 90% of the length of the est with at least 90% sequence identity; and 4) realignments of ests with two other algorithms were required to agree in three out of all three independent alignments . the resulting dataset of identical computational inferences of three methods contained  <dig>   a5es and  <dig>   a3es.

we subdivided alternative exons into their core and extension, where the latter is the sequence between the distal and proximal splice sites. the extension  included lengths up to about  <dig> nucleotides, with quickly decreasing transcript coverage/utilization as e increases. larger extensions existed, albeit with barely more than a few transcripts . for the sake of simplicity, we defined the boundary between a5e  overlapping and non-overlapping splices at e >  <dig>  nucleotides and displayed the distribution f for e =  <dig> ,..., <dig> nucleotides in a window across the boundary region. noticeably, the obtained distribution f for both a5es and a3es was highly biased for extensions with overlapping splice sites. figure  <dig> shows  that for extensions at the 5'ss the bias is caused predominantly by a peak at e =  <dig> nucleotides. it further shows for a5es that short extensions exhibit a small but persistent pattern periodically occurring at e =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides, all multiples of three, and thus preserving the reading-frame. these patterns of as for short extensions were in accord, both qualitatively and in good approximation quantitatively, in an independent, comparative analysis for the mouse mus musculus . overall, the median sizes of inferred alternative exons showed that ses and a5es tend to be shorter than ces and a3es, while overlapping and skewed to larger sizes .

unexpectedly, figure  <dig> was indicative that different splice-alignment algorithms gave rise to quite different outcomes, particularly when faced with alignments involving short extensions. among several standard algorithms, sim <dig> displayed a strong tendency toward e =  <dig> nucleotides. we took a conservative approach to substantiate the identified a5e events, by realigning all corresponding transcripts to the same genomic sequence with two other algorithms, exalin and blat . the results showed that for e =  <dig> the proportion of a5e events derived from sim <dig>  was markedly higher than alignments derived from exalin or blat – yet the bias for extensions was consistently shown at e =  <dig> nucleotides, though with a lower proportion of ~9% . manual inspection of selected sim <dig> alignments showed apparent sequence inconsistencies, when compared to the secondary alignments . in all,  <dig>  of  <dig>  a5es were taken for further analysis, where ~9%  accounted for e =  <dig> nucleotides extensions.

in order to compare these findings with a3e events, we obtained the distribution of short extensions and identified a similar, albeit distinctively different pattern . figure  <dig> shows that f exhibits a clear peak at e =  <dig> nucleotides, with successively smaller peaks at e =  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides. again, these as patterns were corroborated in a comparative analysis for m. musculus . the extension preference of alternative 5'ss and 3'ss exons is in accord with previous studies, where in particular e =  <dig> nucleotides for a3es had been examined and found to obey the pattern nag/nag/ <cit> .

tandem donors and acceptors
patterns of a5es and a3e extensions with overlapping splice sites are interesting in their own context, because they are 1) occurring most abundantly; 2) possibly differently regulated than non-overlapping, i.e. competitive, splice sites of alternative 5'ss and 3'ss exons  <cit> ; and 3) predictive of different downstream effects of as, resulting into preferred different modes of alternative splicing at the 5'ss  and the 3'ss . for overlapping 5'ss and 3'ss are mainly characterized by extensions of four and three nucleotides, respectively, hereafter we denote by "a5eΔ4" tandem donors with e =  <dig> and similarly by "a3eΔ3" tandem acceptors with e =  <dig> nucleotides. we study for tandem donors known sequence features involved in the recognition of the 5'ss, and compare them to the 3'ss of alternative and constitutive exons, including exons with pseudo donors.

generally, the basic recognition and binding to 5'ss incorporates intronic  and exonic nucleotides . the consensus motif for 5'ss of mammalian genes is known as cag/gtragt , where the purine  is either an adenine  or a guanine  base. this nine nucleotide-long motif is highly degenerated and, in fact, in the present data set of human exons only proportions of ~ <dig> %  and ~ <dig> %  of inferred constitutive exons exhibited exact matches to the motifs cag/gtaagt or cag/gtgagt, respectively. figure  <dig> illustrates splice sites and utilization of tandem donors for three selected human genes :

a. the gene rad9a  is a homolog conserved from yeast to human, which encodes a cell cycle-check point control protein that is required for cell-cycle arrest and dna damage repair. the primary transcript sequence of rad9a exhibited two alternative, overlapping 5'ss at exon e <dig>  identified as cag/gcag/gt at the distal 5'ss and cag/gtagtt at the proximal 5'ss that extends e <dig> . the distal and proximal 5'ss gave rise to three and  <dig> mrnas, respectively, which aligned to the primary transcript structure of rad9a. in addition to the tandem donor pattern, figure  <dig> shows the splice site strength, quantified by the maxent score , and the conservation profile across exons and intron, quantified by the phastcon score  <cit>  computed across several genomes . local regions of high levels of sequence conservation for exons compared with the intron are apparent.

b. a tandem donor was detected for e <dig>  of the acad <dig> gene , which encodes a member of the acyl-coa dehydrogenase gene family and plays a role in lipid catabolism. the distal and proximal 5'ss gave rise to  <dig> and eight mrnas, respectively. figure  <dig> shows for e <dig> consistently elevated levels of sequence conservation.

c. the arginine/serine-rich splicing factor  <dig>  showed a tandem donor at e <dig> . distal and proximal 5'ss choice gave rise to nine and six mrnas of sfrs <dig>  respectively. figure  <dig> shows that the level of sequence conservation of e <dig> steadily rises toward the 3'-terminus and extends well across the exon-intron junction to i <dig>  before it rapidly decays, which was indicative of conservation due to splicing-regulatory function  <cit> .

experimental validation of tandem donors
having obtained sufficient evidence from stringent transcript alignments, we pursued to validate the functional utilization of tandem splice sites from independent lines of evidence. to this end, we first searched publicly available literature  for as events involving short 5'ss extensions. yet we found only a very limited number of reported cases of splice variants with short extensions that could be traced back to tandem acceptors. the human clasp gene , for instance, encodes the clk4-associating arginine/serine-rich -related protein that binds to the family of cdc2-like kinases  <cit> . the 5'ss of e <dig> of the clasp/sfsr <dig> is an alternative tandem donor, which gives rise to the splice forms clasps  and claspl . both isoforms differ by  <dig> nucleotides, where clasps carries a ptc due to out-of-frame splicing and thereby omits a third rs-domain encoded by clasp/sfsr <dig>  both isoforms were tissue-enriched in the mice brain and testis, and displayed different intra-nuclear locations, possibly controlled by the third rs-domain  <cit> . another as event involving tandem splice sites has been detected in the human growth hormone  gene cluster, whose expression is developmentally controlled. the gene gh-v differentially expressed three isoforms in the placenta and testis, one of which is due to a tandem donor splice site  of exon e4; the tandem site was not sequence-conserved in the remaining four family members . the use of the distal out-of-frame splice site caused a reading-frame shift of e <dig> downstream, which, in turn, overread the original termination codon and utilized a new  termination codon further downstream. overall, the original splice variant and gh-v/Δ <dig> shared 124/ <dig> and differed by 95/ <dig> amino acids.

clearly, the detection of alternative tandem splice site exons is hampered due to the high similarity of isoforms and often only detectable by direct sequencing and protein sequence analysis. consequently, an experimental assay was used to explore the splicing patterns of computationally identified alternative tandem donors directly. table  <dig> list the names of a set of  <dig> genes with tandem acceptors , which were manually selected from known genes exhibiting a varying degree of transcript coverage  and tested in a battery of human organ systems and cell types by rt-pcr primers targeted to the flanking exons; panels of nine normal tissue samples  were assayed. the products of these  <dig> rt-pcrs were used to verify the identity of these pcr products by sequencing . for instance, figure  <dig> shows for e <dig> of sfrs <dig> schematically the gene structure, proximal and distal sites of the tandem donor, and the sequence electropherogram interrogated in samples derived from the human spleen and blood. upstream of the e <dig> tandem donor, both transcript sequences identically overlap and thus cannot be distinguished in the electropherogram; downstream, two nucleotide signals appear above the base line, indicating the presence of two isoforms.

a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons were selected according to both transcript coverage, concordance of tissues inferred from cdna-libraries of a5eΔ <dig> genes, and commercially available samples. rt-pcr primers were targeted to flanking exons, assayed, and sequenced. in the last column, "+" indicates that the tested a5eΔ <dig> splicing exon was detected to be present in both splice variants of the corresponding samples, separately for each tested tissue . in all, 7/ <dig> a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons were verified in panels of nine normal tissues. in the fourth column , "+" indicates the presence of a premature termination codon. a additional retention-type intron 

two distinct levels of a5e proximal and distal splicing
studies of the inclusion and exclusion of skipped exons of the human and mouse genomes have shown that ses can be broadly subdivided into two types: ses that are included in the majority of transcripts , and those that are predominantly excluded . interestingly, such ses posses different splicing and phylogenetic properties  <cit> . here, we examined whether this property is more generally related to alternative exons, by analyzing the transcript coverage of  <dig>  a5es with one proximal/one distal 5'ss . figure 4a shows a scatter plot of the distal against proximal 5'ss transcript coverage for both tandem and competitive donors; the individual transcript coverage of the distal  splice site is placed above . the scatter plot shows that the number of aligned transcripts ranges from a single transcripts up to more than one hundred, with the average centering on ~ <dig>  and is biased toward lower coverage . we defined the ratio of proximal over distal 5'ss usage  and computed r for human, as well as mouse, a5es. the inset of figure 4a shows that the histogram of the log displays a bimodal distribution, which is indicative of the presence of two types  of alternative 5'ss exons – one, which is characterized by the utilization of the proximal over the distal 5'ss , and another by the utilization of the distal over the proximal 5'ss . this is reminiscent of the "major/minor form" definition of ses, albeit here it applies to both a5e proximal and distal splice sites. we used the threshold of rc =  <dig> to group all a5es into type-i and ii, or a remaining type, based on the behavior of r . having two subpopulations of tandem donors, we denote by "pΔ4"  the major  form proximal donor of type-i, and by "dΔ4"  the major  form distal donor of type-ii. similarly, competitive proximal and distal 5'ss splice sites are denoted as "pΔ"  for type-i and as "dΔ"  for type-ii, respectively .

in all, tandem and competitive a5es comprise a set of  <dig>  out of  <dig>  , remaining ~12% that either exceeded the threshold definition or were covered by a single transcript. the density of pΔ and dΔ splicing exons was ~59%  and ~41% , which was in some contrast to pΔ <dig> and dΔ <dig> of type-i with ~26%  and type-ii with ~69%  exons, respectively . scatter plots, populations, and histograms were corroborated in a comparative analysis of the transcript coverage for a5es in m. musculus .

splice sites of a5es score differently between type-i and type-ii
we computed the 5'ss score distribution to study the relationship between different types of transcript coverage and sequence-complementarity of base pairing to u <dig> snrna. to this end, we applied a maximum-entropy , or markov-random field, based model, which has been shown to capture additional statistical significant dependencies of splicing signals than standard position-weight matrix representations  <cit> , to score the 5'ss of all a5es . figure 5a shows for all pΔ and pΔ <dig> splicing exons of type-i the score distribution, f, of the distal against proximal 5'ss. the score is large  when the splice site is 'close' to the consensus sequence, and small  when the splice site shows marked deviations from the consensus. for type-i, we found that the scores of most pΔ and pΔ <dig> splicing exons were positive, ranged up to s =  <dig> , and clustered narrowly around a mean value of spΔ ≈ spΔ <dig> =  <dig>  . in contrast, scores of the corresponding dΔ and dΔ <dig>  fluctuated more broadly, and mean values were between ΔspΔ <dig> ≈  <dig>  and ΔspΔ ≈  <dig> weaker than the corresponding major-form splice site. interestingly, this trend was reversed for exons of type-ii , where for sdΔ and sdΔ <dig> the score clustered between  <dig> to  <dig>  yet for minor-forms was again broadly distributed and clustered around spΔ ≈  <dig>  and spΔ <dig> ≈ - <dig> , respectively. the different pattern of narrow/broad scattering of a5eΔ <dig> splice site strengths in dependence of their type was corroborated in a comparative analysis of f in m. musculus .

observed patterns  of proximal  and distal  tandem splice sites occurred with markedly different proportions . to what extent were the observed pΔ <dig> and dΔ <dig> splicing exons different from constitutive splicing exons  with pseudo donors having a "genomic predisposition" for tandem splicing ? we addressed this question by looking for constitutive 5'ss  that were flanked by another gt dinucleotide at a distance of four nucleotides either upstream  or downstream of the authentic 5'ss . we searched a set of ~ <dig>  ces  that exhibited proximal and/or distal pseudo tandem donors. assuming position-independent nucleotide concentrations, the expected proportions would be ~10%  and ~48% , where the latter reflects the gt motif at positions p <dig> and p <dig> of the 5'ss consensus. we found that dΨ <dig> was lower than its expected occurrence and was present only in ~4% of ces , whereas pΨ <dig> was similar, albeit still significantly different, to the expected occurrence and present in ~47% of ces ; a substantial proportion of ~5%  was comprised by gynn/gynngy, but was excluded from further analysis to avoid any ambiguity. the score distribution f for the above sets showed related differences. the mean scores of pΔ <dig> and constitutive 5'ss , spΔ <dig> =  <dig>  and s5'ss =  <dig> , were about equally large , yet sdΨ <dig> = - <dig>  was significantly lower as compared with sdΔ <dig> =  <dig>  . similarly, the mean scores of dΔ <dig> and constitutive 5'ss , sdΔ <dig> =  <dig>  and s5'ss =  <dig> , were found to be similar, but still significantly different , whereas spΨ <dig> = - <dig>  was significantly lower than spΔ <dig> = - <dig>  . in words, minor splice variants of tandem donors  scored larger than pseudo variants , while lower than 5'ss of constitutive splicing exons, and were consequently sufficiently different from pseudo splice sites, despite the same genomic pattern.

 the coverage is shown for major-form distal  and proximal  tandem donors. genes with inferred dΔ <dig> splicing exons outnumber genes with pΔ <dig> splicing exons about  <dig> -fold, which is reflected in their overall cdna  and est  coverage. in addition to/gt, the/gy motif is shown, if the presence/gc was statistically significant.

discriminating between major and minor a5eΔ <dig> versus constitutive splicing exons
we used the difference between the 5'ss score distribution f of major and minor a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons of tandem donors to test, based on the behavior of f alone, how accurate pΔ <dig> can be distinguished from dΔ <dig>  and dΔ <dig> from pΔ <dig> splicing exons. to this end, for type-i we computed the cumulative distribution f), with n =  <dig> ,...n, for the set {spΔ4}, by 1) rank-ordering all scores s from the smallest to the largest score; 2) calculating sn = Σm =  <dig> .ns; and 3) normalizing f) = sn/sn. by construction, f) is a monotonically increasing function of s and takes on its largest value at f) =  <dig>  similarly, we computed g =  <dig> - f for the set {sdΔ4}, a monotonically decreasing function of s that takes on its largest value at g) =  <dig>  the intersection of f and g yields for each set the accuracy at which {spΔ4} and {sdΔ4} can be distinguished, with smallest probability of error on the classification of both sets  <cit> .

note that distinguishing the sets above by means of a 5'ss score difference and the log-likelihood difference , presented in  <cit> , are closely related. this can most easily be seen, by considering splice site scores derived from a standard position specific weight-matrix  model with independent nucleotide frequencies: provided the pswm background model remains unchanged, the slice site score difference is equal to the lld. for the maxent splice site model incorporates higher-order statistical dependencies between nucleotides, this exact relationship is replaced by correlated values.

for this data, the subsets of pΨ <dig> and dΨ <dig> splice sites hold an upper limit on the overall number of human tandem donors, where the pseudo splice site remained unobserved or unutilized. using the threshold scores suggested from discriminating pΔ <dig> against dΔ <dig> , as well as dΔ <dig> against pΔ <dig> , one finds that  <dig>  of the dΨ <dig> set and  <dig>  exons of the pΨ <dig> set exceed these thresholds as putatively unobserved tandem donors.

nucleotide conservation around major and minor a5eΔ <dig> splice sites
given existing differences between tandem donors and constitutive splicing exons with either dΨ <dig> or pΨ <dig> splice sites, we compared and contrasted the nucleotide conservation around splice sites . to this end, we computed for each splice site position  the nucleotide frequencies of proximal and distal tandem donors in type-i and type-ii, and represented their information score i by individual sequence logos  <cit>  . i is close to zero in the absence of nucleotide conservation with respect to the background, and increases with increasing conservation up to around two bit per sequence position.

for constitutive exons, possible dΨ <dig> motifs are shown in rows  <dig> and  <dig>  and possible pΨ <dig> motifs are shown in rows  <dig> and  <dig>  for alternative a5eΔ <dig> exons, tandem donors are shown in the last two rows.

on the one hand, clear statistical differences were found for dΔ4/pΔ <dig> splicing exons with, e.g., significantly lower levels of c but higher levels of t at p- <dig>  compared to dΨ4/5'ss splicing exons. together with p- <dig> and p- <dig>  which show a significant enrichment of g and a  of dΔ4/pΔ <dig> over 5'ss/dΨ <dig> splicing exons, respectively, p- <dig> possibly mismatches to u1snrna upon binding to pΔ <dig>  while p- <dig> and p- <dig> possibly support splicing upon binding to dΔ <dig> due to sequence-complementarity of base pairing with u <dig> snrna. other elevated levels of dΔ4/pΔ <dig> splicing exons were found for t at p- <dig> , a at p- <dig> , g at both p- <dig> and p <dig> , and c or t at p <dig> . on the other hand, dΔ4/pΔ <dig> splicing exons showed a significant decrease  of a   worsening the match with u <dig> snrna for both dΔ <dig> and pΔ <dig>  while an increase of a at p <dig>  and t at p <dig>  improved the u <dig> snrna sequence-complementarity of pΔ <dig> over pΨ <dig>  in all, several splice site positions were differently depleted or elevated, often with the possibility to enhance the sequence-complementarity to u <dig> snrna  <cit> . in particular, g at position p- <dig> has been attributed as crucial for u <dig> but not u <dig> snrna base pairing, creating stacking effects to g at p <dig>  <cit> , and the association of p- <dig> and p+ <dig> observed for a5eΔ <dig> major-forms, as well as a5es and ces but also for dΔ <dig> splicing exons , was pointed out in carmel et al.  <cit> . additionally, p- <dig> and p- <dig> of dΔ4/pΔ <dig> splicing exons showed elevated levels of a over dΨ4/5'ss and could promote u <dig> snrna-dependent base pairing via uridines in the u <dig> invariant loop, suggested to compensate for weaker u <dig> snrna affinity  <cit>  .

the different levels were in accord with the average information score that takes into account the levels of all nucleotides, at a given position, against a background level. figure 6b shows the difference Δi between tandem and constitutive 5'ss, which is positive  for higher  scores of tandem against constitutive 5'ss. we found that dΔ4/pΔ <dig> splicing exons carried overall more information at p- <dig>  p-6-p- <dig>  and p- <dig>  but as well at p- <dig>  whereas we found that dΔ4/pΔ <dig> carried less information at p- <dig> and p- <dig>  but more at p <dig> and p <dig>  interestingly, figure 6b shows no marked fluctuations of Δi between tandem and constitutive 3'ss. figure 6c supports the above positional constraints detected for type-i and type-ii, by showing the conservation around major  splice sites between human a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons and mouse exons of orthologous genes, 'anchored' at/gt or/gc splice sites, respectively . dΔ4/pΔ <dig> splicing exons only conserved positions p <dig> and p <dig>  whereas dΔ4/pΔ <dig> showed two recognizable overlapping 5'ss  and u <dig> snrna sequence-complement base pairing with extension nucleotides  <cit> .

exon-flanking sequences show levels of conservation in type-i, but lack of it in type-ii tandem donors
exon and flanking sequences of alternative conserved exons, or aces, of orthologous human and mouse genes exhibit significant levels of sequence conservation. this has most clearly been demonstrated for aces that undergo exon-skipping  <cit> , and has also been shown for comparatively smaller sets  of a5es and a3es, including a3eΔ <dig> tandem acceptors  <cit> . such conservation could imply the utilization of splicing regulatory signals that are common to orthologous sets of genes.

we examined whether a5es and their flanking regions exhibited comparatively higher sequence conservation when compared with constitutive exons. to this end, we mapped the set of tandem and competitive a5e exons to exons of orthologous mouse genes. imposing a level of at least 80% sequence identity and canonical splice sites, we obtained matches for about 75% of pΔ <dig> and 90% of dΔ <dig> splice variants. for each species, we extracted the sequences of exons and up to  <dig> nucleotides of their flanking sequences downstream of the donor splice sites, and assessed the conservation levels for exon and intron regions . we mapped as control sets 536/ <dig> a3eΔ <dig> splicing exons ; a randomly selected subset of ces with  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig>  up-  and downstream  pseudo splice sites, respectively ; and a randomly selected subset of  <dig> / <dig>  ses . note that exons of orthologous mouse genes can be constitutive or alternative and, if so, of the same or a different as type.

occurrence of splicing signals in exon-flanking sequences
the above analyses suggested a higher downstream intron conservation of pΔ <dig> as compared to dΔ <dig> and constitutive splicing exons, in conjunction with a different splice site score between the major and minor splice variants. we examined whether the occurrence of splicing-regulatory elements could, to some extent, possibly explain the observed differences . to this end, we searched for over-representations of known oligonucleotides  implicated in splicing regulation, which were enriched in a5eΔ <dig> over constitutive exon-flanking regions from one to  <dig> nucleotides. we made use of four sets of previously computationally and/or experimentally identified nucleic sequence elements: fas2-ess  and pess elements , ires , as well as ese elements .

exon e <dig> of the gene sfrs <dig>  e.g., showed two purine-rich motifs, ggggggc and ggtggg, located at  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the 5'ss , respectively. additional hexamers were located between the positions  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides , while other sequence elements  occurred often closer to the e <dig> proximal donor of sfrs <dig>  between five and  <dig> nucleotides. poly-rich sequence elements are binding sites for the family of hnrnp splicing regulators  <cit>  and have been implicated in the control of 5'ss choice  <cit> . interestingly, a phylogenetically conserved poly-rich sequence element has previously been reported as involved in the selection of tandem/gtnnnn/ga splice sites in the splicing of the human fgfr gene  <cit> .

a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons often produce nmd target substrates
inferred as events of a5eΔ <dig> and a3eΔ <dig> splicing exons showed a "splicing dichotomy" between the 5'ss and 3'ss – while as events of the latter result in subtle but perhaps biologically significant in-frame variation of a single amino-acid, tandem donors result in out-of-frame shifts downstream of the tandem donor and could thus lead to a truncated protein with different function or unproductive splicing, depending on the  exon position. indeed, regulated unproductive splicing and translation  has been proposed to be a mechanistic link between as and the nmd quality control pathway  <cit> . what is the proportion of a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons in the present data that might be subjected to nmd? to address this, we 1) 'standardized' the initially obtained a5e annotation by matching it with refseq-annotated sequences; 2) identified refseq sequences with complete exon-intron structures and annotated start-stop codons of protein coding sequence  regions; and 3) imposed proximal and distal splice sites, and recalculated the altered reading-frame and stop codon position downstream of a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons, while neglecting possible compensating as events at this step .

the detection of in-frame stop codons is schematically sketched in figure  <dig>  in all, 153/ <dig>  inferred a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons were confirmed by at least one refseq sequence at the distal , proximal  or either  donor site, respectively. a large majority of a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons  was located in cds regions, with only marginal proportions in the 5'-untranslated region  or 3'-utr. during splicing, choice of the out-of-frame tandem donor will create an mrna isoform with an in-frame stop codon that introduces a premature termination codon  and shortens the c-terminus in ~97% of all considered cases. tandem splicing of exon e <dig> of the human rad <dig> gene at e8dΔ <dig>  e.g., truncates the rad <dig> domain by  <dig> amino acids . while possibly still maintaining the domain functionality, the loss of four c-terminal phosphoserines could prevent the interaction with the  cell-cycle checkpoint response complex  <cit> . in contexts of type-i and type-ii, we found more than twice  nmd candidates produced by dΔ <dig> splicing exons , as compared with ~ <dig> % pΔ <dig> splicing exons . the reminder of about  <dig> % of nmd candidates did not stem from type-i or type-ii.

in all, about three-quarters  of ptcs were located more than  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon junction, and thus predicted to produce a marked proportion of nmd substrates  <cit> . interestingly, a small number of a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons  was going to avoid the truncation of the transcript due to the out-of-frame shift but instead extended it. in close relation to premature termination codons , we term these "delayed" termination codons , where all detected dtcs were produced from utilization of the minor donor . for instance, tandem splicing at the pΔ <dig> donor of exon e <dig> of the hnrpu gene , which encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein  u, extended the cds region by  <dig> amino acids. due to the frame shift and the occurrence of synonymous and non-synonymous codons, the amino-acid sequence is changed such that the complexity at the protein level  increases at the c-terminal end.

discussion
alternative splicing is essential for protein diversification and has recently been suggested as mechanistically linked to post-transcriptional gene regulation via nonsense mediated mrna decay   <cit> . the consequences for protein sequence and function alteration, as well as triggering of the nmd pathway, have been demonstrated for exon-skipping events in several studies  <cit> . while there is further evidence for the functioning and regulation of the remaining types of alternative exons  <cit> , our understanding of their sequence evolution, produced as patterns, regulation, and functioning still remains relatively vague  <cit> . in this paper, we analyzed differences and similarities between sets of a5es, a3es, and ces, and focused on a particular type of a pair of alternative donors that are tandemly arrayed and overlapping.

alternative 5'ss exons  were computationally inferred from a collection of stringently aligned cdna and est sequences to the human genome, and their sequence features were compared to known features involved in rna splicing. spliced-alignments were obtained from the three independent algorithms . exalin detected the smallest number of subtle as patterns, which are characteristic of tandem donors , most of which were also identified by sim <dig> and blat. for there is no "true" method of inferring as events, all analyses were based on the subset defined by the intersection of the predictions of all three algorithms. while one cannot rule out misalignments still arising from three methods in some instances, rigor was taken to produce a confidence-enriched set. in addition, we pursued other independent lines of evidence and experimentally validated a subset of  <dig> human genes with tandem donors across different tissues. the outcome confirmed about 50% a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons and provided evidence that a substantial fraction of tandem donors detectable in public sequence repositories are not explained by sequence alignment ambiguities. we found that almost one tenth of all human a5es with exactly one shorter and one longer splice variant, and no other inferred splice type , were a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons. interestingly, figure  <dig> also shows a small but persistent pattern of higher frequencies at e =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, which is indicative that competitive splice sites had biased extensions that preserve the reading-frame.

the central outcome of our study points to a splicing dichotomy between human alternative 5'ss and 3'ss exons in that they were markedly biased toward overlapping splice sites, with a5es biased for e =  <dig> nucleotides , in contrast to a3es biased for e =  <dig> nucleotides . both, a3e and a5e biases in exon length variation have been previously reported  <cit> , but their pertinent features have largely remained hidden. it is important to note that as at both the 5'ss and 3'ss gives rise to splicing variations with very subtle changes to the encoded protein sequence, but further downstream a5eΔ <dig> and a3eΔ <dig> splicing exons lead to very different consequences. while a3eΔ <dig> splicing exons of the form of nag/nag/have been analyzed in some detail, in part with several controversial interpretations  <cit> , a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons had not previously been confirmed experimentally and only initially been characterized  <cit> .

in this context, pertinent questions are whether 1) such frequently observed changes arise possibly by spliceosomal error, and 2) the eukaryotic cell has found a way to neutralize or even benefit from downstream consequences that arise from such as events. provided their biological authenticity, what is the nature of overlapping splice site choice? several models for splice site choice have been proposed, including the competition between antagonistic splicing factors  and u <dig> snrnp  <cit> , a scanning mechanism  <cit> , or cis-acting motifs with different free-energy for binding u <dig> snrnp and splice factors between competing sites  <cit> . these models take into account the binding property of the u <dig> snrna and additional factors. consequently, we investigated known features involved in splice site choice, as well as consequences to the post-transcriptional regulation of a5eΔ4-carrying genes, and compared a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons with a3eΔ <dig> and constitutive splicing exons in the light of existing models for 5'ss selection.

examined features showed differences that individually came out subtle, yet taken in concert were indicative of a spliceosomal distinction of overlapping 5'ss. we found that overlapping tandem donors, but not acceptors, can be distinguished into major-form  and minor-form  splicing exons for both proximal and distal splice sites. this is further corroborated by splice site scores, which correlated with their respective major/minor-form behavior. on the one hand, splice sites deviated most from the consensus for pΔ <dig> splicing exons at positions p- <dig>  p- <dig>  and p <dig>  as well as p <dig>  p <dig> , overlapping positions of u <dig> snrna nucleotides implicated in 5'ss selection  <cit> ; some of which have also been related to codon preference  <cit> . interestingly, more distant positions, such as p- <dig> also displayed statistically significant deviations from the consensus. because of its close proximity to the edge of the u <dig> snrna stem-loop it possibly contributes to u <dig> binding when dΔ <dig> is spliced. on the other hand, dΔ <dig> splicing exons showed different deviations from the consensus at p- <dig>  p- <dig>  p <dig>  as well as p <dig>  p <dig> . based on other experiments on position-specific stabilizing and advancing spliceosomal interactions with the 5'ss, these differences between type-i and type-ii are indicative that pΔ <dig> improves above dΔ <dig> splicing compatibility with u1-snrna,

previous computational studies showed the conservation of sequences flanking aces at higher levels as compared with sequences around species-specific or constitutively spliced exons  <cit> . we observed higher levels of conservation around pΔ <dig>  but similar levels for dΔ <dig> splicing exons, when compared with constitutive exons . interestingly, the higher level is in accord with a larger number of detected splicing-regulatory  elements, often positioned in proximity to a5e tandem donors. in contrast to typical as events, however, tandem donors are hindered to place regulatory elements between alternative donors. our data show an elevation of ese elements near dΔ <dig>  in conjunction with an enrichment of ess elements of flanking introns. this could be interpreted in a model, in which tandem donors restrictively exploit elements in proximal polarity , to attract the u <dig> snrnp to this site of the tandem donor, and/or in distal polarity to dΔ <dig>  to impair binding to pΔ <dig>  <cit> .

for the majority of tandem donors was embedded in cds regions, the downstream effects of Δ <dig> splicing was predictive of producing ptcs. splicing at pΔ <dig> produced putative nmd substrates in more than two-thirds of all cases, whereas dΔ <dig> splicing exons showed about one-quarter, suggesting that pΔ <dig> and dΔ <dig>  were more likely to serve as the corresponding nmd candidates. interestingly, a small set of a5eΔ4-carrying genes avoided ptcs, yet instead was inferred to use dtcs  positioned downstream of the original signal. utilization of the e <dig> proximal tandem donor of the human sfrs <dig> gene, e.g., with significantly high levels of e <dig> flanking sequence conservation well over  <dig> nucleotides in i <dig> , produced a ptc that apparently avoided nmd  <cit> . using differentially binding antibodies, a previous study  <cit>  showed that sfrs <dig> produced two detectable isoforms, which correspond to e <dig> tandem splicing. in another example, a Δ 4-type 5'ss change from type-i  to type-ii splicing was observed in e <dig> of human patients with a deficiency in the adenosin deaminase  gene, where a p+1g>a transition downstream of e <dig> activated splicing of a latent proximal donor  <cit> .

a survey of gene ontology  functions of the categories "molecular function" and "biological process" for genes with pΔ <dig> and dΔ <dig> splicing exons showed a significant enrichment in several proteins, while after corrections for multiple testing only the single go-term "rna binding"  was significantly enriched, when compared between pΔ <dig> and dΨ <dig>  as well as dΔ <dig> and pΨ <dig>  splicing exons .

CONCLUSIONS
this study substantially affirms the utilization of tandem donors, thus supporting and complementing earlier findings of previously undetected as events  <cit> . while there exist examples of cryptic Δ 4-type 5'ss in the literature  <cit> , here we demonstrated that such splice variations are potentially enriched in authentic as events, also supported by experimental studies  <cit> . critically, pertinent data are not yet at hand to make conclusive inference about the specific regulation of a5eΔ <dig> splicing exons , here transcript data acquisition and careful spliced-alignments have added to a higher confidence of tandem donor  utilization, and deeper insight will require different types of data, e.g., from mini-genes in different organ systems and cell types, u <dig> snrnp mutants, or variations of splicing factor dosages.

in one extreme view, incorporating a mechanistic and dosage-dependent model  <cit> , the selection of as sites depends on the properties of u <dig> and/or u <dig> snrnps binding interrelated with antagonistic effects mediated by splicing enhancing and suppressing factors. thus it was shown, e.g., that the choice of a tandem splice site of e <dig> of the fgfr gene can be determined by a higher sequence-compatibility of the e <dig> proximal splice site  to u <dig> snrna  <cit> . in addition, constraints set by secondary mrna structures  <cit>  have been shown to influence splice site choice. in the opposite extreme, suggested by the reduced difference of splice site scores, tandem donors could be the outcome of stochastic binding at overlapping 5'ss and lack implicit functional implications  <cit> , which is supported by type-i isoforms. either view largely requires the nmd pathway to control deliberatively or aberrantly produced truncated messages.

coming back to the question of whether there is a possible benefit of generating flawed mrna isoforms, by deliberately or aberrantly produced as variants with out-of-frame shifts and ptcs , what could be their functional utilization on the transcriptional or translational level? if such splice variants would be generally produced across organ systems and cell types, in addition to their normal splice variants, cells would have means of producing low levels of imperfect proteins. depending on the efficiency of mrna quality control, a fraction of which is subjected to the nmd pathway during the first pioneer round of translation and degraded, while a remaining fraction could still misfold and – depending on the quality control of protein synthesis – form defective ribosomal products . ubiquitin-tagged peptide fragments that originate from drips have recently been identified as a potent source of antigens for display by the mhc class i molecules on the cell surface to cognate cd8+ t-cells, in agreement with a recently suggested mechanism of "immune surveillance"  <cit> . a motivating example is given by the human tyrosinase-related protein  <dig> , which utilizes two different reading-frames to produce the protein gp <dig>  and a truncated  <dig> amino-acids long peptide. the latter was shown to be the source of an antigenic peptide specifically recognized by t-cells as a tumor rejection antigen  <cit> . it remains to be substantiated whether such antigenic peptides are linked to as events that produce variants with out-of-frame shifts, such as produced by tandem donors.
