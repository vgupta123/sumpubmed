BACKGROUND
shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> is a facultative, gram-negative bacterium capable of coupling the oxidation of organic carbon to a wide range of electron acceptors such as oxygen, nitrate and metals, and has potential for bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated sites  <cit> . the complete 5-mb genome of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> was sequenced by the institute for genomic research , and standard sequence-comparison methods revealed that approximately 42% of the mr- <dig> genome encodes proteins of unknown function  <cit> . whole-genome sequence analyses from a variety of other microorganisms also indicate that 30–60% of the identified genes encode proteins of unknown function. defining the functions of hypothetical proteins is a great challenge and may need a systems approach. a structure-based approach provides clues about the biochemical functions of a hypothetical protein  <cit> . the emergent whole genomic microarray and proteomics are providing new experimental tools for our understanding of functions and regulations of novel proteins in a context of global response to environmental stresses and genetic disturbance  <cit> . the patterns of gene expression changes are giving clues into the mechanisms of action of response. combining with traditional approaches, the functions of novel proteins could be elucidated more efficiently by an integrated methodology.

we initiated a study to characterize the functions of a hypothetical protein of s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  the protein, which is designated so <dig> , was initially identified during a 2-d gel expression study of a shewanella fur  mutant. during aerobic respiration of this fur mutant, results showed the expression of so <dig> was down-regulated  <cit> . so <dig> contains  <dig> amino acids, and homologues are apparent in other bacteria, such as yqik  of escherichia coli and a putative exported protein of salmonella enterica, with 45% and 44% sequence identity, respectively. phi/psi-blast search results showed that so <dig> is included in a conserved, hypothetical, bacterial protein family cog <dig>  similarity search also showed that the n-terminal sequence of so <dig> belongs to the phb  family and the spfh  domain /band  <dig> superfamily. prohibitin  are ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved proteins with homologues found in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, it was suggested that the phb proteins were involved in mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly and played a role in the biogenesis of newly synthesized subunits of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes  <cit> . hflc and hflk of e. coli are two members of the spfh domain/band  <dig> superfamily. they associate with and negatively regulate the ftsh aaa protease and participate in the lysogenic decision during bacteriophage λ infection  <cit> . other members of spfh domain/band  <dig> superfamily also include: stomatin, one of the major integral membrane proteins of human erythrocytes  <cit> , and the caveolae-associated flotillins  <cit> . although proteins of both stomatin and flotillin families appear to be involved in important biological processes, very little is known about their in vivo functions.

according to the sequence annotation  <cit> , genes encoding so <dig> and so <dig> might be in the same operon. the so <dig> and so <dig> genes are only separated by 23-bp. on the downstream of the so1377-encoding gene, a ρ-independent transcriptional terminator is identified. thus, so <dig> and so <dig> might be on the same transcriptional unit. the genes encoding so <dig> and  <dig> are flanked by so <dig> and so <dig> loci. so <dig> is annotated as a putative oxidoreductase of  <dig> amino acids. a phi/psi-blast search showed that so <dig> belongs to duf <dig>  a protein family consisting of several bacterial proteins of around  <dig> residues in length. the function of duf <dig> family is unknown. previously, a computational analysis of secondary and 3-d structure of so <dig> was carried out and revealed that this protein had potential functions in the formation of protein complexes at the inner bacterial cell membrane, atp/gtp binding, nucleotide binding, protein transport and molecular chaperone  <cit> .

in this study, we continued our efforts to elucidate the functions of so <dig> by generating an in-frame deletion mutant of this gene, followed by a series of experiments to characterize its phenotypic and physiological changes compared with the wild type strain. our results showed that the knock-out of so <dig> gene had pleiotropic effects and suggested that so <dig> perhaps plays a role in the iron homeostasis and oxidative damage protection in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> 

RESULTS
generation of in-frame deletion mutant of so <dig> gene
the suicide vector, pds <dig> , was used in generation of deletion mutant of so <dig> gene . pds <dig>  was derived from the suicide plasmid pcvd <dig> by a blunt ligation of sali digested pcvd <dig> with a gel purified  <dig> bp fragment of mlui digested pbsl <dig>  in which harbors the gentamicin resistance gene. by crossover pcr, a  <dig>  kb dna fragment containing the mutated so <dig> gene, with a 1496-bp deletion, was constructed . this deletion construct was ligated with pds <dig>  and then transferred into e. coli s17-1/λpir by electroporation. by employment of colony pcr, the resultant plasmid was confirmed and designated as pwg <dig> and the e. coli host strain wg <dig> . by transconjugation between donor strain e. coli wg <dig> and recipient strain s. oneidensis dsp- <dig>  the constructed suicide plasmid pwg <dig> containing the deletion mutation of so <dig> gene was transferred and integrated into the chromosome of dsp- <dig> . the occurrence rate of recombinants generated from transconjugation/integration of plasmid pwg <dig> was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  by growing the recombinant strain wg <dig> on lb agar in the presence of 6% sucrose, a total of  <dig> colonies appeared after two days incubation at 30°c. of these colonies,  <dig> lost gentamicin resistance, indicating they had resolved the suicide plasmid pwg <dig> from the chromosome of wg <dig> . further colony pcr revealed about 50% of  <dig> colonies had the deletion copy of so <dig> gene in place of the wild-type copy. since initial growth assays showed that all deletion mutants had the similar growth deficiency compared with that of the wild-type control, in follow-up experiments we focused on one deletion mutant, wg <dig>  for further characterization of phenotypes by using whole genomic microarray and proteomics technologies.

growth features of the deletion mutant
when grown under aerobic conditions in mr2a medium, the deletion mutant wg <dig> had a growth deficiency compared to the parental strain dsp- <dig> . under this condition, the average generation time of wg <dig> was  <dig>  hours while that of dsp- <dig> was  <dig>  hours. wg <dig> failed to reach the same final optical density as dsp- <dig>  similar results were obtained in lb under aerobic conditions . however, under anaerobic conditions, no difference in growth rates was observed between wg <dig> and dsp- <dig> in the defined medium m <dig> supplemented with lactate  as the electron donor and nitrate  or fumarate  as the electron acceptor . as well, the ability to reduce soluble fe or co was not affected in wg <dig> in anaerobic m <dig> medium using lactate  as the electron donor. this infers that the function of so <dig> is not involved in dissimilatory reduction of metals.

transcriptional profile differentiation between mutant and wild type strain
whole genome microarrays were used to identify genes whose transcription was affected by the deletion of so <dig> gene. gene expression in the mutant wg <dig> cells, recovered from log phase growth in aerobic mr2a medium, was compared with the expression of dsp- <dig> cells using the same growth conditions. statistically , transcription of  <dig> % of the genes  was affected by the deletion of so <dig> gene . the magnitude of expression alteration of these genes was up to 30-fold. of  <dig> genes,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were involved in 'energy metabolism', 'cellular processes' and 'transport and binding proteins', respectively . significant changes of transcription occurred in  <dig> hypothetical proteins. as expected, the transcription of so <dig> gene was not detected in the mutant wg <dig> cells but highly expressed in parental strain dsp- <dig>  meanwhile, so <dig> gene, which was predicted to be co-transcribed with so <dig>  did not have a significant change in transcription relative to the reference control.

the microarray data showed that the mutation of so <dig> gene resulted in decreased transcription of genes encoding proteins of siderophore biosynthesis  and, the outer membrane siderophore receptor  . other genes involved in iron transport, binding and storage also exhibited alteration in transcription relative to the wild-type strain . for instance, the so <dig> gene, encoding a putative ferric iron reductase, was down-regulated over 2-fold in transcription .

the transcriptional profiling of the mutant also revealed that genes involved in oxidative damage protection were up-regulated compared to the wild-type strain . the most significant was so <dig> , a putative heme-containing enzyme that catalyses the dismutation of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, was highly up-regulated in the mutant wg <dig> and exhibited more than a 5-fold difference in transcription . this suggested that the increase of internal oxidative stress might be due to the deletion of so <dig> 

note that deletion of the so <dig> gene resulted in transcriptional alternation of genes encoding subunits of respiratory electron carriers . most significantly, the transcription of a cluster of genes which encode subunits of cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase, such as so <dig> , so <dig> , so <dig>  and so <dig> , was suppressed in the mutant . suppression of complex iv of the respiration chain suggested inhibition of aerobic respiration in the mutant. consistent with this, the transcriptional level of a cluster of genes encoding so <dig> through  <dig>  involved in c4-dicarboxylate transport, was down-regulated . unlike abc-type transporters, which couple atp hydrolysis to translocation of solute across the cytoplasmic membrane, c4-dicarboxylate transport system belongs to another group of transporters, designated tripartite atp-independent periplasmic  transporters. the driving force of trap for solute accumulation comes from an electrochemical ion gradient, which is generated from aerobic respiration, rather than atp hydrolysis  <cit> . interestingly, some genes related to anaerobic respiration were up-regulated in the mutant in relation to the wild-type control. for instance, so <dig> gene, which encodes a cytochrome c <dig> nitrite reductase, was up-regulated over 2-fold in the mutant transcription. also, a cluster of genes encoding subunits of fumarate reductase, including so <dig> , so <dig>  and so <dig> , were up-regulated  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively . this result suggested that the condition used for culturing the bacteria was not strictly aerobic. instead, it was microaerobic. under such conditions, genes that were supposed to be expressed only under anaerobic conditions could be induced. furthermore, our microarray data showed that, under the same conditions, these anaerobically expressed genes were induced at a higher magnitude in the deletion mutant than that of wild-type cells. this may be one kind of compensations to the energy loss in aerobic respiration in mutant cells.

proteomic profile differentiation between mutant and wild type strain
to investigate alterations in protein expression as a result of the so <dig> gene mutation, both mutant wg <dig> and its parental strain dsp- <dig> cells were subjected to proteomic profile analysis using two-dimensional  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  followed by micro liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry . representative 2-d gels of the two strains are presented in figure  <dig>  four polypeptides  increased significantly  in the mutant cells relative to the control. in addition, five polypeptides  displayed decreased expression and two polypeptides  were not detected at all in wg <dig> cells . micro-lc-esi-ms/ms was used to identify proteins showing significant differences in amount on 2-d gels . proteins  completely absent in the deletion mutant were identified as so <dig>  and so <dig> , respectively. therefore, similar to microarray analysis, the protein profile verified the deletion of the so <dig> gene. among other identified proteins, those exhibiting lower gel abundance in the mutant, included so <dig> , so <dig> , so <dig> , and so <dig> . note that consistent with microarray data, the lower gel abundance of so <dig>  the alpha subunit of atp synthase f <dig>  suggested inhibition of aerobic respiration. the increased gel abundance of proteins included so <dig>  and so <dig> . again, the increased gel abundance of so <dig> agreed with the microarray data, in which the transcription of so <dig> gene displayed an increase at the magnitude of  <dig> -fold in the mutant cells . however, the remaining proteins shown in the proteomics data did not exhibit transcriptional changes. one possible explanation for this inconsistence between microarray and proteomics data is that the expression of these proteins is subjected to post-transcriptional regulation.

phenotypic differences between the mutant and wild type strain
as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  iron metabolism was altered in the mutant wg <dig> when compared with the parental strain dsp- <dig>  whole cell low temperature epr assay showed that wg <dig> accumulated  <dig> times less 'free' iron than dsp- <dig> , although its total cellular iron level remained largely unchanged . when wg <dig> and dsp- <dig> cells were grown on iron-depleted cas medium, wg <dig> had decreased siderophore production .

as shown in figure  <dig>  mutant wg <dig> was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment, compared to the parental strain dsp- <dig>  almost 100% of the mutant cells were killed by  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide treatment whereas over 30% wild type cells survived. to kill all wild type cells,  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide was needed. this indicated that the mutant became more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide challenge.

mutant wg <dig> generated spontaneous mutations at a much higher rate than its parental strain dsp- <dig>  in this study, both gentamicin and kanamycin resistance were used as markers to measure the spontaneous mutation rate. after two days incubation, an average of  <dig> gentamycin resistant cfu  arose from wg <dig>  whereas none appeared from dsp- <dig>  the average cfu for wg <dig> and dsp- <dig> was  <dig>  × 109/ml and  <dig>  × 1010/ml, respectively. therefore, it was estimated that the spontaneous mutation rate of gentamicin resistance from wg <dig> was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> whereas the control was less than 10- <dig>  similarly, the estimated spontaneous mutation rate of kanamycin resistance of wg <dig> was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> whereas the control was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively.

discussion
previously, a 2-d gel expression study revealed that the expression of protein so <dig> was down-regulated during aerobic respiration in a s. oneidensis fur  mutant  <cit> . we were curious if the protein was involved, directly or indirectly, in iron metabolism of s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  results from this study provided evidence for this hypothesis. the deletion of so <dig> gene altered iron metabolism. compared with the wild-type control, the mutant accumulated  <dig> times less intracellular 'free' iron, although the change of total intracellular iron was not evident. siderophore secretion was lower in the mutant. this was supported by the microarray analysis which showed that the expressions of some genes involved in iron metabolism were altered.

our study showed that the disruption of so <dig> affected other aspects of cellular activities of s. oneidensis. so <dig> mutant wg <dig> was highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide challenge and had a higher spontaneous, mutation rate of other genes. microarray analysis showed that even without h2o <dig> challenge, some genes involved in oxidative damage protection were up-regulated, presumably in response to an increased level of internal h2o <dig>  due to deletion of the so <dig> gene. these phenotypic changes were typical and well documented for mutants of genes involved in iron metabolism and/or oxidative damage protection  <cit> . for instance, the study carried out by touati et al  showed that the permanent derepression of iron assimilation systems in a fur deletion mutant of e. coli produced an oxidative stress and dna damage including lethal and mutagenic lesions  <cit> .

microarray/proteomic analysis also suggests that dysfunction of so <dig> affects the proteins involved in respiratory electron transfer and thus respiration functions. the overall trend shows, genes involved in aerobic respiration down-regulate, whereas those involved in anaerobic respiration up-regulate. this coincides with the phenotype observation showing that the mutant has a growth deficiency under aerobic but not anaerobic conditions. this suggests that so <dig> perhaps plays a role in oxidative damage protection in the wild-type strain. without protection from so <dig>  cells tend to down-regulate their aerobic respiration and are more prone to produce free radicals under aerobic conditions. probably as compensation, bacterial anaerobic respiration pathways were up-regulated in the mutant cells. with the same reasoning, decreased secretion of siderophore, for iron absorption and less accumulation of loose intracellular iron in the mutant should be viewed as adaptation responses of bacterial cells to the loss of so <dig> function. nevertheless, without so <dig>  the bacterium becomes more susceptible to h2o <dig> treatment and gives rise to spontaneous mutation of other genes at a level much higher than that of the wild-type strain.

little is known about the action of so <dig> and how it biochemically interacts with other proteins is still a speculative issue. since no sequence/structure clues suggest that so <dig> could directly interact with iron or any other metals, it is more likely that the phenotypes derived from disruption of so <dig> is indirect. that is, through interactions with other proteins, so <dig> may indirectly participate in iron metabolism of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> 

we envision that so <dig> is likely to function as an accessory protein participating in intracellular iron trafficking in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  evidence supporting this idea comes from several lines. the n-terminal sequence of so <dig> belongs to the phb protein family. computational analysis suggests that so <dig>  has potential functions in formation of protein complexes at the inner bacterial cell membrane, atp/gtp binding, nucleotide binding, protein transport and, molecular chaperone  <cit> . tc-blast searching shows that partial sequences of so <dig> have similarities with atx <dig> and bsd <dig> of s. cerevisiae, respectively . in s. cerevisiae, atx <dig> encodes a manganese-trafficking protein that localizes to golgi-like vesicles  <cit> , whereas bsd <dig> encodes a copper homeostasis factor  <cit> . also, so <dig> has four cysteine residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as well as two histidine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that this protein, of  <dig> amino acids, has potential to be a metalloprotein. still, a ges hydrophopathy analysis infers so <dig> is a membrane protein. these clues suggest that so <dig> could play a role as a metallochaperone, directly participating in intracellular iron trafficking. working together, a presumed so1376/ <dig> complex could receive ferrous iron from an upstream protein, i.e. so <dig> , and then transfer it to downstream proteins, such as those involved in cytochrome heme biosynthesis or fe-s center biosynthesis, etc. the dysfunction of so <dig> could impair the function of so <dig> and compromise the effective process of intracellular iron  trafficking resulting in the free iron 'leaking' into the cytoplasm of cells. as a highly reactive species, the 'leaking' free iron could generate very toxic radicals under aerobic conditions, resulting in hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, presumably as a result of fenton chemistry. consequently, this elicits dna damage and onset of sos response. this may explain why the so <dig> mutant has a higher level of gentamicin/kanamycin resistant mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
we continued our efforts to elucidate the functions of so <dig>  a hypothetical protein with a homolog domain to prohibitin of eukaryotes, by generating an in-frame deletion mutant of this gene, followed by a series of experiments to characterize its phenotypic and physiological changes compared with the wild-type strain. our studies showed that the mutant had a decreased growth rate when cultured aerobically and not affected under anaerobic conditions. whole-genome expression  profiles revealed numerous gene and protein expression changes relative to the wild-type strain, including some involved in iron metabolism, oxidative damage protection and respiratory electron transfer, e. g. complex iv of the respiration chain. although total intracellular iron levels remained unchanged, whole-cell epr demonstrated that the level of loose iron in mutant cells was  <dig> times less than wild type cells. siderophore excretion in the mutant also decreased in iron-depleted medium. compared with the wild type strain, the mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and gave rise to  <dig> times more colonies resistant to gentamicin or kanamycin. our study showed that deletion of so <dig> gene had pleiotropic effects suggesting that so <dig> perhaps is involved in the iron metabolism and oxidative damage protection of s. oneidensis mr- <dig>
