BACKGROUND
by a rough estimation,  <dig>  million foodborne non-typhoidal salmonella infections and consequently  <dig> deaths occur in europe annually  <cit> . salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serotype typhimurium  is, after the serotype enteritidis, the second most commonly isolated serotype from human salmonelloses in europe  <cit> . in finland, the total number of reported salmonella infections ranged from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> cases per year in 2007– <dig>  <cit> . of these infections, 10–30 % were considered domestically acquired and serotype typhimurium dominated among the domestic isolates  <cit> . most salmonelloses are characterized by mild-to-moderate self-limited diarrhoea but also serious disease resulting in death has been reported especially in connection with stm infection in children less than  <dig> years old  <cit> . salmonella infections, including those caused by stm, are considered sporadic and their sources remain unknown. however, national outbreaks  <cit>  and large outbreaks across the national borders associated with stm have also been reported  <cit> . the stm outbreaks are frequently associated with consumption of contaminated raw vegetables, fruits, poorly cooked meat or meat products and eggs .

molecular subtyping of bacterial isolates is crucial when monitoring the circulation of bacterial strains across the geographic regions. subtyping methods must fulfil many requirements such as high discriminatory power, easy performance, clear interpretation and possibility for international standardization. currently, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , which has been internationally standardized, is considered as the golden standard for genotyping of salmonella and it is the only generic molecular method suitable for all salmonella serotypes . however, not all the isolates unrelated to an outbreak are different by pfge from the outbreak-related isolates and pfge has been shown to suffer from a high variation between the different laboratories. thus, new typing methods have been developed around the world. among these, multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis  has been used as a typing tool for tracing back the sources of foodborne disease outbreaks, in bacterial surveillance and in research  <cit> . mlva can be used to discriminate between genetically closely related strains  <cit> . a database of tandem repeats for several completed salmonella genome sequences is publicly available at http://mlva.u-psud.fr/mlvav4/genotyping/  <cit> . these variable-number tandem repeat  markers have been applied for typing and clustering of several salmonella serotypes, for example, dublin  <cit> , enteritidis  <cit> , gallinarum  <cit> , montevideo  <cit> , newport  <cit> , paratyphi a  <cit> , typhi  <cit>  and typhimurium  <cit> . mlva typing has also been used successfully in several stm outbreak investigations . reduced typing time, easy handling and clearer interpretation of mlva results, compared to those of pfge, are beneficial in an outbreak situation. the major disadvantage of mlva is serotype-specificity. there is, for example, no mlva protocol which is suitable for all the over  <dig> salmonella serotypes and, currently, internationally standardized mlva protocols are available for only a few serotypes. in europe, the 5-loci mlva scheme developed by lindstedt et al.  <dig>  has been widely adopted for stm by several national public health laboratories  <cit> . the mlva loci nomenclature devised by larson et al.,  <dig> allows the normalisation of the raw data and enables a direct comparison of the mlva results between laboratories  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to characterize finnish stm isolates using several pheno- and genotyping methods. for that,  <dig> sporadic stm isolates from finns who had not been abroad recently were characterized by phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, xbai-pfge and 5-loci mlva during the 5-year period between november  <dig> and october  <dig>  the specific aim was to determinate  the genetic diversity among the finnish stm isolates, especially those of endemic definitive phage type dt <dig>  and to detect clonal clusters,  to compare the discriminatory power of xbai-pfge and 5-loci mlva and  to investigate whether the 5-loci mlva results are in concordance with the phage typing or xbai-pfge results. in addition, the potential and possible added value of 5-loci mlva as a typing tool in a laboratory for the stm surveillance was evaluated.

RESULTS
overall diversity of the isolates
the  <dig> stm isolates from finns, who had not travelled abroad recently were typed by phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pfge and mlva . among the isolates,  <dig> distinct phage types were detected . of the isolates, 65 %  were assigned to the three most common dts: dt <dig> , u <dig>  and dt <dig> . each of the remaining phage types contained less than 4 % of the isolates . the isolates associated with the phage type called “reacts but does not conform”  accounted for 10 % . based on similar phage reactions, these isolates were divided into five groups rdnc1- <dig> . in addition,  <dig> isolates showing each a unique rdnc pattern were found. of all the isolates, 62 %  were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. within the most common phage types, 74 %  of dt <dig>  87 %  of u <dig> but only 3 %  of dt <dig> isolates was susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. on the whole, 11 %  were multidrug resistant  . the three most common mdr patterns were acssutnx , acssut  and assut , representing 8 % of the isolates. of the dt <dig> isolates with any resistance marker, 45 %  displayed resistance to six antimicrobials . all of the  <dig> nx resistant isolates had a decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin . in addition to the  <dig> dt104isolates, a decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin was observed in two dt <dig> , two u <dig>  and one dt104b  isolates. furthermore, one isolate of phage type u <dig> showed combined resistance to more than six antimicrobials including an intermediate resistance to cefotaxime. none of the isolates were resistant to imipenem.table  <dig> characteristics of each mlva loci for s. typhimurium

in the molecular analyses,  <dig> different xbai-pfge and  <dig> different mlva profiles were generated . among dt <dig> isolates, the most common xbai-pfge profile stym <dig> contained  <dig> mlva profiles, of which the mlva profile 3-16-na-na- <dig> was the most prevalent. the u <dig> isolates were divided into six xbai-pfge and seven mlva profiles . the most common xbai-pfge profile stym <dig> showed five different mlva profiles, of which again the 3-16-na-na- <dig> was the most common. the dt <dig> isolates were divided into six xbai-pfge and  <dig> mlva profiles . here, the most common xbai-pfge profile stym <dig> contained  <dig> different mlva profiles, of which the profile 3-13-5-12- <dig> was the most common.

although higher number of mlva types  than xbai-pfge profiles  were generated , the calculated diversity indices for mlva  and for xbai-pfge  were comparable and the confidence intervals partly overlapped . the discriminatory power of mlva was better for the three most common phage types compared to xbai-pfge. in general, the mlva data obtained in this study suggest that mlva better performance compared to xbai-pfge varies with phage type . in general, the mlva data that we have obtained suggest that mlva is phage type dependent. the discriminatory power of mlva was better for the five most common phage types compared to xbai-pfge . in addition, the simpson’s diversity indices for each of the five mlva loci varied being highest for locus sttr <dig>  and lowest for locus sttr <dig>  . the highest variability in repeat numbers at one locus was found in locus sttr <dig>  and the lowest in locus sttr <dig>  .table  <dig> discriminatory power of three typing methods for  <dig> sporadic s. typhimurium isolates

relatedness of the sporadic isolates by pfge and mlva
upgma clustering was done by construction of dendrograms for both pfge and mlva profiles . the cluster analysis of xbai-pfge results demonstrated a genetic similarity of more than 70 % among the studied isolates . in  <dig> cases the pfge banding patterns differed from each other only by the thickness of one band. the most common xbai-pfge profile stym <dig>  was evenly distributed during the study period. nonetheless,  <dig> isolates showed a unique xbai-pfge profile. the cluster analysis of mlva types revealed that no particular clustering emerged between the stm isolates. the majority of the isolates had mlva type 3-16-na-na- <dig> but also  <dig> unique mlva types were detected . the most common feature among the finnish stm isolates was the lack of loci sttr <dig> and sttr10p, both loci were absent in 70 % of the isolates .fig.  <dig> a upgma dendrogram of xbai-pfge pattern of  <dig> stm isolates. each xbai-pfge profile  is presented only once and the number of isolates column provides information on frequency of each xbai-pfge profile. stym <dig>  was the most common profile and  <dig> isolates had a unique profile

concordance of mlva with phage typing and pfge
to assess the concordance between the three subtyping methods, adjusted wallace  and adjusted rand  coefficients were calculated . a poor directional correlation between 5-loci mlva and xbai-pfge and phage typing was found. the probability of two isolates that have the same mlva type to share the same xbai-pfge profile was only 30 % meaning that neither phage type nor pfge profile could be predicted directly from the mlva type. according to the aw and ar coefficients, the highest concordance was between xbai-pfge and phage typing .table  <dig> concordance between the typing methods presented by adjusted wallace  and adjusted rand  coefficient



discussion
stm is the most frequently isolated salmonella serotype from the finns who suffer from salmonellosis and have not travelled abroad prior to their symptoms  <cit> . thus, accurate surveillance of stym is of public health importance. since the 1960s, stm has caused the majority of the domestic salmonellosis in finland . salmonella isolates, however, are rare in finnish production animals  and only about 1 % of the animals tested are salmonella positive  <cit> . in addition, the phage types circulating among the animals are well known  <cit> . for example, stm dt <dig> which was the most common cause of domestic human salmonella infections in this study, is endemic in finland and isolates with this phage type have been isolated from production animals  and wild animals since the 1980s  <cit> . phage types dt <dig> and u <dig> have been isolated from domestic turkey, wild birds, hedgehogs and regularly from human infections as well  <cit> .

more than 60 % of all the clinical isolates and almost 75 % of all the dt <dig> isolates were susceptible to all  <dig> antimicrobials tested in this study. similar susceptibility results were observed during previous years as well  <cit> . this could result from moderate usage of antibiotics in finnish animal husbandry  <cit> . nonetheless, 11 % of our isolates were found to be mdr including nine different phage types . several studies have shown mdr to be more common among certain stm phage types e.g. in dt <dig>  <cit> . because mdr salmonella is rare among domestic production animals, the occurrence of mdr isolates among finnish patients could indicate that at least some of the domestically acquired infections might actually be due to imported foods sold in supermarkets and restaurants  <cit> . according to a study in finland, the risk of receiving salmonella from imported beef or beef products was close to 1 %  <cit> . on the other hand, in a recent source attribution study in sweden it was estimated that almost  <dig>  % of the domestic salmonella infections are due to imported foods  <cit> . alternatively, some of the infections could be secondary infections from patients, who have contracted their salmonella infection abroad. furthermore, about 5 % of the domestic isolates had decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, defined as mic ≥  <dig> mg/l, which has in previous studies been associated with travelling abroad  <cit> .

discriminatory power of a method, defined as the ability to distinguish between unrelated isolates, is commonly obtained by calculation of simpson’s diversity index. in order to get a more objective measure of the subtyping methods used, two different indices, simpson’s and shannon’s, were calculated. both diversity indices provided similar degree of diversity and shannon’s diversity index  also indicated that the different pts, xbai-pfge profiles and mlva types were equally distributed in the stm population during the study period. in addition, comparable discriminatory power was evidenced for both methods . sporadic domestic stm isolates showed only limited amount of diversity. the studied isolates showed a genetic similarity of more than 70 % by xbai-pfge. in mlva, absence of two loci was characteristic for domestic stm isolates as 71 % of the isolates lacked sttr <dig> and 77 % were missing sttr10p loci. despite of missing loci,  <dig> distinct mlva types were observed. according to other studies, mlva was highly discriminatory  for stm  <cit> . low diversity observed, especially among the domestic dt <dig>  might result from factors such as geographical isolation, endemic nature of the isolates and lacking of two loci  in finnish stm, rather than from the low discriminatory ability of mlva method as such. this is supported by the fact that the pfge typing showed low diversity as well. the dt <dig> isolates in new zealand  <cit>  and the stm isolates in malaysia  <cit>  have also been shown to lack sttr <dig> and sttr10p loci.

based on the results of this study, the national salmonella reference laboratory at thl has since january  <dig> used the 5-loci mlva as the primary genotyping method for stym isolates and xbai-pfge as the secondary method for epidemiological investigations. despite the comparable degree of discriminatory power for xbai-pfge and mlva, the latter was more cost-effective, faster to perform and above all, easier to interpret and apply in international comparison. however, in order to interpret 5-loci mlva results appropriately in outbreak situation, more information on vntr mutation rate and their stability is needed. some studies have been conducted to determine the vntr stability. for example, the influence of multiple freeze-thaw cycles on single-colony isolates and the effects of external stress to bacterial genotype have been studied. a study performed with escherichia coli o157:h <dig> revealed that certain stress factors  can affect the mutation rate of multiple tandem repeats in one locus more  <cit> . another stability study revealed that changes were observed mainly in mlva loci sttr <dig>  sttr <dig> and sttr <dig>  but a single change was also detected in sttr <dig>  <cit> . in conclusion, the majority of the stability studies agree that the order of instability among stm loci is following sttr6 > sttr10 > sttr5 > sttr9 > sttr <dig>  nevertheless, as with any typing method, the results obtained with mlva must be viewed in conjunction with the epidemiological data. importantly, international criteria for cluster and outbreak investigations should be agreed on.

CONCLUSIONS
in finland, domestically acquired infections caused by salmonella serotype typhimurium account for approximately 30 % of all domestic salmonella infections. in this study, the three most common phage types, xbai-pfge and 5-loci mlva profiles comprised  <dig>   <dig> and 49 % of the  <dig> sporadic stm isolates, respectively. more than 60 % of the isolates were susceptible to all  <dig> antimicrobials tested. for the most common phage types, the 5-loci mlva had better discriminatory power than xbai-pfge. furthermore, in a daily use, mlva is simple, fast, robust and cost-effective technique for subtyping stm isolates. the mlva results are easy to interpret and reproduce, and importantly, the protocol is internationally harmonised allowing the comparison of the results between laboratories. in finland, mlva is used as routine subtyping method for surveillance and cluster detection of domestic stm isolates. nonetheless, phenotyping methods  are useful for outbreak detection, especially when analyzing isolates with a common mlva type.
