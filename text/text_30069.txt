BACKGROUND
carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in both muscles and the liver. as the first relay station for processing dietary information, the liver contains the whole biochemical machinery for both glucose and lipid storage and disposal  <cit> . liver glycogen is the first defensive line when glycemia falls, and is thus the major source of circulating glucose except within 2– <dig> hours after a meal, the so-called postprandial period. these metabolic ways are controlled by the insulin level, insulin having several hepatic effects such as stimulation of glycogenosynthesis and glycolysis. the net effect is clear: when the supply of glucose is abundant, insulin "tells" the liver to bank as much of it as possible for subsequent use. in the absence of insulin, liver glycogenosynthesis ceases and the enzymes responsible for glycogen breakdown become active.

it has been proposed that the hepatic glycogen store may be influenced by lipids  <cit> . reduced hepatic glycogen synthesis is thus an important characteristic of type  <dig>  <cit> , type  <dig>  <cit>  and mody –  <dig>  <cit>  diabetes in humans. although long-chain free fatty acid are well known to induce peripheral insulin resistance and reduce muscle glycogenosynthesis  <cit> , they have been reported to favor the sparing of hepatic glycogen in fasting humans  <cit> , this increase being counterbalanced by acipimox  <cit> , which inhibits lipolysis in peripheral tissues and induces a large reduction in circulating serum-free fatty acids. on the other hand, it has recently been reported that isolated liver perfusion with saturated or unsaturated ffas reduced insulin signaling protein phosphorylation without affecting glycogen content  <cit> . it has been suggested that differential action of ffas on glucose homeostasis could be linked to their nature  <cit> . in fact, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, which is highly expressed in the liver, regulates fat metabolism and improves insulin sensitivity. polyunsaturated ffas are stronger inducers of ppar-α activation than saturated ffas  <cit> . it is unknown whether some effects may occur with short-chain fatty acids  such as butyrate. butyrate is a natural nutriment physiologically produced from intestinal fiber fermentation and found in foods such as butter. butyrate is also the main nutriment for colonocytes. scfa are used in artificial nutrition to allow successful transition to enteral feeding by maximizing the intestinal absorptive area in short bowel syndrome  <cit> . moreover, recent studies on previously undescribed butyrate-producing bacteria from the human colon will help to unravel the effects of diet upon health, including microbial interactions with the immune system, and will help in the design of prebiotic or probiotic strategies for stimulating sub-optimal butyrate synthesis in the large intestine  <cit> . besides the local effect, the remaining fraction reaches the liver through the portal vein to be metabolized. an almost 100% removal of butyrate by the liver has thus been evidenced in rats adapted to a high-fiber diet  <cit> , suggesting better knowledge of the butyrate hepatic metabolism.

we recently reported a positive linear insulin- and glucose-dependent relationship between the net fluxes of glycogen and atp in isolated perfused livers of fed rats  <cit> . this led us to hypothesize that some specific nutrients could interfere with hepatic glycogen synthesis, in that they modify the liver atp content. butyrate induced some changes in energetic metabolism such as  a rapid increase in the net rate of liver atp consumption obtained ex vivo in the isolated and perfused liver  <cit> , and  a 77% decrease in the oxidative phosphorylation yield whereas respiration was greatly stimulated  <cit> . however, it is unknown whether butyrate influences the hepatic glycogen content. the purpose of the present study was therefore to explore the effect of butyrate used as a nutrient on in vivo atp metabolism and glycogen storage in rat liver. after glycogen hepatic depletion by prolonged fasting, we used nmr to investigate the effect of force-feeding with glucose alone or glucose plus butyrate, in isocaloric and isoglucidic conditions, on the kinetic of  liver glycogen repletion and  the change in atp content. the ex vivo measurements were performed on the perfused and isolated organ, excised at different times post force-feeding.

RESULTS
kinetic of liver glycogen repletion after feeding with different diets
1/validation of nmr measurement
liver glycogen content of rats fed ad libitum was  <dig> ±  <dig> μmol/g liver wet weight  under glucose+insulin perfusion  . the 13c c- <dig> glycogen signal was not detected in the liver after  <dig> hr of starvation  since 13c nmr sensitivity was limited to about  <dig> μmol/liver.g ww. to validate nmr measurements, we compared them with enzymatic analyses on the liver extracts . in fasting animals, the liver glycogen content determined by biochemical assay was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww . there was also a decrease in hepatic fatty acid content after  <dig> hr starvation, as previously reported  <cit> .

whatever the diet used, glycogen content increased regularly with time after the first  <dig> min post force-feeding. glycogen content and time evolution were not different between in vitro enzymatic measurements and ex vivo nmr experiments. two typical 13c nmr spectra of liver isolated at the 6th hour post feeding with glucose alone or glucose+butyrate are shown in fig. 1c and 1d, respectively. an increase in fatty acid content was also observed after feeding, as already described  <cit> .

2/diet a:  <dig>  mg glucose/g body weight 
starting with an undetectable nmr glycogen content in the fasting state, a time-dependent linear increase  was observed during  <dig> minutes post feeding. then a steady state of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  was reached between the 5th and the 6th hour. thereafter, the glycogen content slowly decreased  to reach  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  at the 8th hour post feeding.

3/diet b:  <dig>  mg glucose/g body weight 
from the nmr undetectable glycogen content in the fasting state, a time-dependent linear increase  was observed during  <dig> minutes post feeding. a maximal level of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  was reached at the 6th hour. thereafter, the glycogen level slowly decreased  nearly 2-fold more than in diet a, to reach  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  at the 10th hour post feeding.

4/diet c: /g body weight 
diets a and c were isoglucidic, while diets b and c were isocaloric , diet c containing less glucose  than diet b. after ingestion of diet c containing butyrate, a linear increase in glycogen content  was observed over  <dig> hours at the same rate as in isocaloric diet b, despite the slightest glucose content. a maximal glycogen level of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  was reached at the 8th hour post feeding, which was significantly higher  than in isocaloric diet b  or isoglucidic diet a . thereafter, the glycogen content rapidly decreased at a rate of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/min.g- <dig> ww to reach a level of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww at the 10th hour , a value similar to that in isocaloric diet b.

5/areas under the curves
areas under the curve  highlighted the effects of glucose and butyrate contents in diet on the glycogen resynthesis. a significant increase  was obtained in auc glycogen0– <dig> in diet b  versus diet a . a significant increase in aucs glycogen in diet c  versus diet a  was obtained: auc glycogen0– <dig> p =  <dig> , auc glycogen0– <dig> p =  <dig> , auc glycogen0– <dig> p =  <dig> . significant higher values of aucs glycogen in diet c versus diets a and/or b at particular periods of interest  are presented .

kinetic of liver atp content after feeding with the different mixtures 
the atp level was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  in rats fed ad libitum and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww after  <dig> hr fasting . whatever the diet, the atp content remained unchanged during the first hour after feeding.

1/diet a:  <dig>  mg glucose/g body weight
the atp content slightly increased  after the 1st hour post feeding, from the basal state to a plateau of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  reached at the 6th hour.

2/diet b:  <dig>  mg glucose/g body weight
the atp time change was similar to that in diet a, except that the atp net flux was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  10- <dig> μmol/min.g- <dig> liver ww; atp level reached a plateau of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww  at the 6th hour. thereafter, it remained stable until the 10th hour post force-feeding.

3/diet c: /g body weight
from the 1st hour post force-feeding, the atp content slightly increased  to reach a plateau of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol/g liver ww at the 8th hour post feeding  . the atp content remained stable until the 10th hour post feeding, the presence of butyrate in the diet inducing a higher atp level than after the isoglucidic diet a .

changes in serum glucose and insulin concentration at the steady state
in the  <dig> hr-fasted rats, glycemia and insulinemia were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μui/l, respectively . in the fed rats, glycemia was similar with the glucose+butyrate diet c  and isocaloric glucose diet b  at the plateau of glycogen content, whereas insulinemia was lower  with the glucose+butyrate diet  than with the isocaloric glucose diet . although we did not directly measure insulin sensitivity, this decrease in insulin concentration whereas glycemia was maintained suggested an improved insulin sensitivity. hence, according to the glycemia-to-insulinemia ratio, the peripheral insulin sensitivity was significantly higher at the steady state of liver glycogen content after feeding with butyrate   compared to the isocaloric glucose diet b  and to the fasting state .

discussion
the initial purpose of this study was to explore the effect of butyrate, used as a nutrient, on in vivo glycogen storage and atp content in the rat liver. the ex vivo evaluations of the contents were performed on the perfused and isolated organ excised at different times after force-feedings, to accurately reflect the in vivo metabolic contents at each time. in order to mimic physiological conditions and to avoid a rapid and dramatic decrease of the energetic metabolism linked to ischemia, the liver was perfused as previously described  <cit> . the presence of glucose  <dig> mm and insulin reproduced the post-prandial state in the portal vein and allowed to maintain the carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . we sought to investigate the effect of short-chain fa on hepatic glycogen, since contradictory effects on glycogen storage have been previously reported for long chain fa  <cit> . even if propionate, another end-product of colonic bacterial fermentation, could be an interesting candidate to study the metabolism of glycogen, the role of this scfa as a gluconeogenic precursor would be confusing in this study focused on butyrate  since it is not directly a gluconeogenic substrate and  is known to directly decrease the ex vivo atp production  <cit>  affecting thus perhaps the glycogen pathway.

to our knowledge, few studies focused on the kinetic of in vivo liver glycogen resynthesis in fasting rats over a wide time range . since total glycogen depletion is an essential factor to evaluate the initial rate of glycogen resynthesis, we utilized 48-hr starvation in order to empty the glycogen store because 24-hr starvation does not totally deplete it  <cit> . although 48-hr starvation has been reported to increase serum ffa  <cit>  which may interfere with the action of insulin, the duration of fasting in the present work did not differ between all experimental groups. the animals were force-fed once to be sure  that all the substrates were ingested and  that the acute effect of butyrate could be investigated since absorption of the colonic butyrate was spread over  <dig> hr, whilst force-fed butyrate was absorbed within a few hours. moreover, this intake way avoided the repulsion linked to its taste. it is known that this model allows to rigorously control the animal's consumption of dietary nutrients  <cit> .

the quantities of butyrate administered  are not very different from those likely to be produced with a 10% fiber diet or reported to be produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in the rats  <cit> . however, owing to the acidic ph conditions in the stomach accelerating butyrate absorption as protonated form, and if gastric epithelium permeability was elevated, the fraction reaching the liver could be higher than those arising from colonic fermentation. in fact, as shown in preliminary report  <cit> , a change of atp turnover  in the same experimental conditions was observed 2– <dig> hr only after the butyrate force-feeding, suggesting that its gastric absorption was not dramatically rapid.

we distinguished two main phases in the glycogen-storage process that varied with the presence or absence of butyrate in the diet:  an initial period of glycogen repletion and  a plateau of glycogen content followed by depletion.

glycogenosynthesis and glycolysis are the two main modes of glucose disposal in the liver. glycogen repletion showed the well-known glucose dose-dependent increase in glycogen synthesis, as evidenced with the two different doses of glucose alone as already reported  <cit> .

surprisingly, a similar hepatic glycogen synthesis rate  was obtained with  the diet containing  <dig>  mg glucose/g body weight and  the isocaloric diet containing butyrate and a lower concentration of glucose . to our knowledge there is no experimental evidence to date a direct stimulation of glycogenosynthesis pathway by butyrate. however in fed rat, the stimulation of liver lactate utilization by various fatty acids has been ascribed to a stimulation of gluconeogenesis  <cit>  and thus the contribution of this latter to glycogenosynthesis cannot be excluded. the other mode of glucose disposal is its oxidation, so  <dig>  mg glucose/g could theoretically lead to fewer fluxes of both glycolysis and mitochondrial atp production than the oxidation of  <dig>  mg glucose/g. the observation of a similar hepatic net flux of atp production with  <dig>  mg glucose/g and  suggests that butyrate oxidation  partly replaced glucose as fuel in the oxidation processes, leading to atp through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. some of the atp could be used for glycogenosynthesis. moreover, atp production from glucose oxidation was probably reduced since fatty acids are generally known to inhibit glycolysis  <cit> , as reported for butyrate in isolated hepatocytes  <cit> . hence it may be concluded that butyrate induced a hepatic glycogen-sparing effect by reducing glycolysis, the glucose being exclusively involved in glycogenosynthesis during the first  <dig> hours post feeding. this result is in agreement with a previous report concerning parenteral nutrition in rats in which the combinations of glucose and fat had a sparing effect on body fat and hepatic glycogen  <cit> .

another mode of glycogen saving could be that butyrate spares the glycogen store via inhibition of the glycogenolytic flux through two mechanisms:  a putative direct inhibitory effect of butyrate on glycogenolysis and  a metabolic effect through atp production, as atp is known to have an inhibitory effect on liver phosphorylase a   <cit> . however, the similar atp levels and the similar net atp synthesis rate observed during the first hours following feeding with or without butyrate  are not in favor of this second hypothesis. after the glycogen repletion step, liver glycogen content reached a steady state evidencing an equilibrium between the unidirectional glycogenosynthesis flux and the unidirectional glycogenolysis flux. importantly, butyrate delayed the establishment of the flux equilibrium with a higher net glycogen content until the 8th hr post force-feeding. this can only be due to  the maintenance of glycogenosynthesis and  the inhibition of glycogenolysis, in agreement with recent data showing that in type  <dig> diabetes mellitus patients, free fatty acids improve glucoregulation merely through modulation of the rate of glycogenolysis  <cit> . further studies are required to confirm the latter hypothesis. a better understanding of the mechanistic aspects of butyrate hepatic effect may implied evaluation of changes of uridine diphosphate -glucose, glucose-1-phosphate  or glucose-6-phosphate , as important metabolic crossroads of the glycogen pathways. indeed, hepatic glycogen post-prandial synthesis can be estimated through the level of udp-glucose, which requires mass spectroscopy  <cit> . moreover, metabolic conditions altering i.e. the hepatic g6p content were reported to affect glycogen metabolism through enzymatic regulation  <cit> . however, natural abundance nmr spectra in isolated liver were not sufficiently resolutive to accurately discriminate and quantify udp-glucose and phosphorylated monosaccharides.

butyrate is physiologically produced by the microflora from the fermentation of dietary fiber and mainly has a trophic effect. owing to the capacity of the liver to remove incoming propionate and butyrate, the hepatic utilization of the latter is proportional to the digestive supply  <cit> . moreover, since butyrate is almost totally removed in animals on a very high fiber diet   <cit> , our data suggest that dietary fiber may have a metabolic effect on the glucose and glycogen hepatic pathways.

this effect should be added to the known intestinal mechanical effect of fiber that delays the gastrointestinal action of amylase. human studies have already shown that the glycemic index of carbohydrates is not solely based on different degrees of digestive absorption, but may also depend on changes in glucose disposal  <cit> . intake of dietary fibers has been reported to be associated  inversely with the probability of having protection against insulin resistance in non-diabetic patients  <cit>  and  with enhanced insulin sensitivity in type  <dig> diabetes, whatever the type of fiber  <cit> . rather than a low total carbohydrate diet, a balanced carbohydrate intake rich in dietary fiber such as high fruit and vegetable intake  <cit>  or whole grain cereal products  <cit>  could be protective against metabolic syndrome. accordingly, the present findings demonstrate a possible increase in insulin sensitivity in the interprandial period after feeding with butyrate. the low frequency of hypoglycemic events following a long-term high-fiber diet   <cit>  may also be linked to the higher hepatic glycogen content induced by the time cumulative effect of butyrate.

more anecdotaly, butyrate effect should in part contribute to the effect of acarbose used in the pharmacological prevention of diabetes. indeed, in rats fed with "westernized" diets, acarbose treatment suppressed starch digestion in the small bowel but there was compensatory salvage by bacterial fermentation in the large bowel. cecal total scfa pool size was increased more than 4-fold, with even bigger increases for butyrate. these changes in butyrate were reflected in increased molar proportions of butyrate in blood from both the portal vein and heart  <cit> . acarbose could effectively increased colonic butyrate production by several mechanisms such as reduced starch absorption and larger concentrations of starch-fermenting and butyrate-producing bacteria  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
it must be kept in mind that under our experimental conditions , the observed effects could not be strictly transposed to fiber diets. whatever the case, the hepatic sparing effect of butyrate on both glucose oxidation and glycogen store, could be one of the molecular basis for the effects of dietary fibers on the prevention of insulin resistance. in the muscle, the prevention of insulin resistance in rats supplemented in fiber has been explained by the effect of butyrate increasing glut- <dig> via pparγ  <cit> . to our knowledge, our work is the first to propose a biochemical mechanism in the liver to better understand how one of the main end-products of dietary fibers may regulate glucose metabolism. since these data were obtained after acute intake of butyrate, the chronic effects remain to be studied. the use of dietary fibers could be a simple, non-invasive and socially acceptable method to improve the metabolic pathways involved in metabolic syndrome  <cit> .
