BACKGROUND
survival of the mammalian embryo in utero requires the early establishment of an extra-embryonic interface to provide nutrients and signals for the maintenance of pluripotent embryonic precursors. extra-embryonic tissues are the first to differentiate during mouse development . recent work has demonstrated that these tissues also play an essential role in anterior-posterior  patterning during early post-implantation development . understanding the formation and growth of extra-embryonic tissues is therefore essential for further studies of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these functions.

segregation of embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages is completed at the time of implantation. in the e <dig>  blastocyst, three tissues can be distinguished. the trophectoderm, which allows attachment of the conceptus to the uterine wall, is composed of a mural part surrounding the blastocoelic cavity, and a polar part in contact with the epiblast. pluripotent epiblast cells will form all foetal tissues. finally the primitive endoderm, lining the blatocoelic surface of the epiblast, will give rise to the visceral endoderm , and to the parietal endoderm, which migrates away along the mural trophectoderm. primitive endoderm and epiblast both derive from the inner cell mass  of the e <dig>  blastocyst.

after implantation major morphogenetic changes have occurred. the conceptus now resembles an elongated cup-shaped structure called the egg cylinder. this comprises two regions. at the distal pole, the embryonic region is formed by the epiblast and the overlying ve. the extra-embryonic region, at the proximal pole, contains the extra-embryonic ectoderm, a derivative of the polar trophectoderm, covered by ve. because of the relative inaccessibility of the mouse conceptus, little is known about the dynamics of these morphological changes. in the e <dig>  blastocyst, the epiblast is already present and covered by the primitive endoderm thus defining the embryonic region. in contrast, the formation of the extra-embryonic region is puzzling since the polar trophectoderm in the e <dig>  blastocyst is a single layer of cells not in contact with the primitive endoderm. differential rates of proliferation between polar and mural trophectodermal cells and uterine mechanical constraints have been proposed to explain the formation of the extra-embryonic ectoderm and its engulfment by the ve  <cit> . however, the detailed cellular architecture of the polar trophectoderm is poorly described, and other scenarios for the formation of the extra-embryonic ectoderm involving changes in cell shape or cell arrangement cannot be discounted.

both the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions are covered by the ve. these two ve regions can be distinguished by their cellular architecture  <cit>  and by differential gene expression  <cit>  at e <dig> . cell labelling experiments have shown that the ve precursors at both ends of the animal-vegetal axis of the blastocyst contribute to both embryonic and extra-embryonic regions of the egg cylinder, although cells from one of these two ends contribute more cells to the embryonic region  <cit> . these studies also revealed that the pattern of ve cell growth between these regions is different: while extra-embryonic ve clones were more coherent, the embryonic clones were more dispersed and consisted of small groups of scattered cells at e <dig>   <cit> . however, it has remained unknown whether the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions constitute distinct cellular compartments which do not mix, at the time of their formation shortly after implantation. moreover it remains to be understood how early after implantation ve cells begin to behave differently in embryonic and extra-embryonic regions and how the pattern of their growth relates to the appearance of histological and molecular differences in these regions and to the formation and migration of the ave.

extra-embryonic tissues are involved in tightly regulated reciprocal interactions with the epiblast leading to the establishment of ap polarity at e <dig>  . nodal, a member of the tgfβ superfamily, is required in the epiblast for the specification of a population of distal ve cells  <cit> . at e <dig>  these cells are characterised by a columnar shape, which provides a visible landmark known as the visceral endoderm thickening   <cit> , and by the expression of a specific panel of genes encoding transcription factors like the homeoprotein hhex or secreted proteins like the tgfβ antagonists cerberus-like  <dig>  and lefty <dig>  <cit> . the anterior pole of the embryo is defined by the asymmetric migration of these cells towards one side of the egg cylinder, where they form the ave  <cit> . some genes marking the ave at e <dig>  like hhex and lefty <dig> are already expressed in the e <dig>  icm and in the e <dig>  primitive endoderm though with different patterns  <cit> . these findings raise the question of the origin of the ave. ave cells could arise from a single precursor at the blastocyst stage indicating an early segregation of this lineage during pre-implantation stages. alternatively the ave could be formed by non-clonally related ve cells induced between e <dig>  and e <dig> .

the aim of our study has been to analyse the formation of the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions as the blastocyst transforms into the egg cylinder. as a first step we have characterised the morphology of e <dig> -e <dig>  conceptuses and observed an actin-rich depression in the extra-embryonic ectoderm at the time of the formation of the extra-embryonic region. we have used the technique of single cell labelling in the blastocyst to target ve precursors in the icm surface  <cit>  and analyse their progeny at e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig> . we show that as early as e <dig>  the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions of the ve do not correspond to distinct cellular compartments, and that growth is not restricted across their junction even after the appearance of histological and molecular differences at e <dig> . however we observe distinct patterns in embryonic and extra-embryonic ve regions from the time of ave migration, when ap polarity is visible. finally, using two criteria to identify the ave, the vet and the activity of a cer1-gfp transgene, we demonstrate for the first time the polyclonal origin of this anterior signalling centre.

RESULTS
morphological steps of formation of the extra-embryonic region at the time of implantation
after implantation, two regions are distinguishable within the conceptus. distally, the embryonic region is formed by the epiblast and the overlying ve, whereas the extra-embryonic region proximally contains the extra-embryonic ectoderm covered by ve. in contrast before implantation these two regions cannot be identified. how are they formed?

to answer this question we have recovered conceptuses directly from the crypts of the uterus at different hours on the 5th day of gestation, at the time of implantation. we have analysed their morphological changes based on the staining with phalloidin-texas red in the h2b-gfp transgenic line, to visualise cell borders and nuclei. three stages of conceptuses were identified, depending on their morphology and on the time of recovery. at the implanted blastocyst stage, primitive endoderm cells, in contact with the blastocoel, were clearly distinct from epiblast cells . at this stage some primitive endoderm cells, known as parietal endoderm, were observed on the inner surface of the mural trophectoderm . these embryos were recovered between 3–7pm, and therefore correspond to e <dig> . at the pre-egg cylinder stage, a thickening of the polar trophectoderm could be observed. by this stage this cell layer had been rearranged from a squamous  to a cuboidal epithelium . when several layers can be identified in this tissue, it takes the name of extra-embryonic ectoderm . the ve was clearly visualised at this stage and was curved around the epiblast . pre-egg cylinder stage conceptuses were recovered between 6– <dig> pm, and therefore correspond to e <dig> . it was only at the early egg cylinder stage, that we observed the ve covering the extra-embryonic ectoderm . at the early egg cylinder stage, some conceptuses showed evidence of a forming proamniotic cavity, as judged by the occasional presence of a central apoptotic epiblast cell . early egg cylinder conceptuses were recovered between  <dig> pm– <dig> am, and therefore correspond to e <dig> . these observations show that the extra-embryonic region forms by "thickening" of the polar trophectoderm at the pre-egg cylinder stage, and that it is covered by the ve only from the early egg cylinder stage onwards. in contrast the primitive endoderm already covers the epiblast from the implanted blastocyst stage, thus defining the embryonic region.

to confirm in living embryos the sequence of events described on fixed material, we have performed in vitro cultures. these experiments indicate that implanted blastocysts may develop into pre-egg cylinder conceptuses, as shown by the change in morphology of the polar trophectoderm from a squamous to a cuboidal epithelium . in addition, pre-egg cylinder conceptuses may develop into early egg cylinder conceptuses as shown by the appearance of several layers of polar trophectoderm cells that become covered by the ve . therefore the sequence of stages from implanted blastocyst to pre-egg cylinder and from pre-egg cylinder to early egg cylinder applies to living embryos.

in addition to morphological changes, we have analysed the size of e <dig> -e <dig>  conceptuses . we found that, following the formation of the extra-embryonic region, the total  length increased about  <dig>  fold reaching  <dig> μm , whereas the embryonic region, from the distal tip of the conceptus to the proximal end of the epiblast, grew less, from  <dig> μm  to  <dig> μm . consistently, the ratio between the total and embryonic lengths increased from  <dig>  at the implanted blastocyst stage to  <dig>  at the pre-egg cylinder stage and  <dig>  at the early egg cylinder stage. these results indicate that the extra-embryonic region becomes a significant part of the conceptus after pre-egg cylinder stage.

to get insight into the mechanism of formation of the extra-embryonic region, we have analysed in more detail the extra-embryonic ectoderm at pre-egg cylinder and early egg cylinder stages. we found that 45% of pre-egg cylinder  and 70% of early egg cylinder conceptuses  showed intense phalloidin staining at the proximal pole of the extra-embryonic ectoderm, indicative of a localised enrichment of actin, associated with a slight  or more pronounced  depression of the tissue. this depression was also visible in transmitted light . in the remaining early egg cylinder conceptuses , we did not detect any actin-enrichment or depression of the extra-embryonic ectoderm . however, we noticed that these conceptuses were significantly bigger in size, with a total length of  <dig> μm , compared to  <dig> μm  and some of them  showed evidence of a forming proamniotic cavity. this indicates that the actin-rich depression of the extra-embryonic ectoderm is transient and that this feature is lost as the conceptus develops further. taken together, these observations suggest a new descriptive model for the formation of the extra-embryonic region. after the initial thickening, there is a folding of the extra-embryonic ectoderm which may involve actin. the overlying ve is carried along during this process. this results in the extra-embryonic ectoderm being engulfed by the ve, thereby marking the transition from blastocyst to egg cylinder .

the junction between embryonic and extra-embryonic ve regions is not a compartmental barrier during egg cylinder growth
the ve covers both the embryonic and extra-embryonic region. however ve cells display distinct characteristics in these regions, in terms of cell shape  <cit>  and gene expression  <cit> . such differences have been shown from the time of induction of the ave  <cit> , whereas at the early egg cylinder stage we have observed that differences in the shape of ve cells between both regions are less pronounced . do the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions correspond to distinct cellular compartments at the time of their formation? is growth restricted across the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction during egg cylinder development?

we have used a cell labelling approach to address these issues. precursor cells were labelled before implantation, in the e <dig>  blastocyst. we have microinjected mrna encoding fluorescent proteins into single cells at the surface of the icm, in order to target preferentially ve precursors  <cit> . labelled blastocysts were transferred into the uterus and recovered after implantation at e <dig> -e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  . only e <dig> -e <dig>  conceptuses which had a clearly visible extra-embryonic region  were considered for further analysis. on average,  <dig>  ve labelled cells per conceptus were observed at the early egg cylinder stage ,  <dig>  at e <dig>   and  <dig>  at e <dig>  .

the contribution of ve labelled cells to the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions was analysed. these two ve regions have a similar size, in terms of cell numbers, both at the early egg cylinder stage, when the extra-embryonic region has formed, and at e <dig>  . labelled conceptuses at the early egg cylinder stage, e <dig>  and e <dig>  were classified as embryonic , extra-embryonic  or extra-embryonic and embryonic when both regions were colonised . at all stages examined a majority of conceptuses had labelled cells contributing to both regions . these percentages are significantly higher than the rate of blastocysts with more than one labelled cell after microinjection , indicating that the double contribution to embryonic and extra-embryonic regions is a clonal event. this indicates that many ve precursors at e <dig>  are not restricted in their ability to contribute to the embryonic or extra-embryonic regions.

the proportion of conceptuses with contribution of labelled cells to both regions significantly increased between the early egg cylinder stage and e <dig>  whereas the proportion of labelled conceptuses with exclusive contribution to the embryonic region significantly decreased during the same period . this suggests that as the embryo develops, labelled cells that were located exclusively in the embryonic region at the early egg cylinder stage grow and span the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction to colonise the adjacent region. these results indicate that as soon as they can be identified at the early egg cylinder stage the embryonic and extra-embryonic domains of the ve do not correspond to distinct cellular compartments. moreover there is no restriction of growth between these two regions even after e <dig> , when histological and molecular differences have been shown between embryonic and extra-embryonic ve regions  <cit> .

shift in orientation of ve clusters at the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction after ave migration
given the lack of growth restriction across the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction, we have investigated whether ve cells at the junction between these regions show specific behaviour. we have focussed on clusters of labelled cells which abut or cross the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction . note that some conceptuses have more than one such cluster. we have noticed that junction clusters display specific shapes. they were classified according to their orientation. transverse clusters were parallel to the junction and extended either in the embryonic or extra-embryonic region ; some clusters were oblique ; vertical clusters were parallel to the proximal-distal axis of the conceptus . at e <dig>  and e <dig>  the angle between the orientation of the cluster and that of the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction was measured, to define the categories . at the early egg cylinder stage, clusters were categorised qualitatively as they contained fewer cells and as the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction may not be straight. at all stages when clusters had a rounded shape they were considered as not oriented .

at the early egg cylinder stage, most "junction clusters" were vertical , and only a minority showed a transverse orientation . this suggests that between e <dig>  and the early egg cylinder stage, ve cells tend to grow along the proximal-distal axis as the egg cylinder elongates, with disregard to the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction. in contrast transverse and oblique orientations were more frequent at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . these observations indicate that the orientation of clusters at the junction between the embryonic and extra-embryonic region is shifted, such that it becomes preferentially parallel to the junction rather than to the proximo-distal axis of the egg cylinder.

to clarify the timing at which this shift takes place, we have staged e <dig>  egg cylinders according to the position of the migrating ave. we have used the published nomenclature, based on the distal , laterodistal  and lateral  position of the vet  <cit> . more than half of the "junction clusters" were vertical  at e <dig> d and l/d , similarly to the situation at the early egg cylinder stage. in contrast at e <dig> l most "junction clusters" showed transverse or oblique orientations . these results suggest that the orientation of junction clusters is shifted after ave migration.

we have investigated whether the orientation of junction clusters is different at the anterior and posterior poles after ap polarity becomes visible at e <dig> l and e <dig> . the majority of vertical clusters appeared to be located in the posterior third of the egg cylinder , whereas most transverse clusters were in anterior or lateral positions . this suggests that the shift in orientation of junction clusters is more pronounced at the anterior pole. this may be a consequence of the movement of ave cells.

ve cells in the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions show distinct growth modes from e <dig> 
though the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions do not correspond to distinct cellular compartments, the appearance of distinct histological and molecular properties from e <dig>  correlates with specific cell patterns at the junction. previous work had indicated that different growth modes distinguish each ve region so that cells in the extra-embryonic region grow as more coherent patches while those in the embryonic region grow in a more dispersive way by e <dig>   <cit> . we have investigated in detail the time of appearance of these distinct growth modes during egg cylinder growth.

we have compared the dispersion of labelled ve cells in the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions at the early egg cylinder stage, e <dig>  and e <dig> . the labelled conceptuses were classified as "coherent" and "dispersive" depending on whether labelled cells form a unique continuous population , or whether distinct clusters of one or more labelled ve cells were separated from the rest of the clone by at least one non-labelled ve cell .

we have found that while at the early egg cylinder stage and e <dig>  around two thirds of the labelled conceptuses were "dispersive"  and one third were "coherent" , at e <dig>  the vast majority of cases were "dispersive" . this indicates that cell mixing in the ve is increased between e <dig>  and e <dig> . coherent distributions of labelled cells can be found in the embryonic region of early egg cylinder and e <dig>  conceptuses, whereas they are restricted to the extra-embryonic region at e <dig>  . this suggests that coherent growth of ve cells becomes specific to the extra-embryonic region, between the early egg cylinder stage and e <dig> .

to further characterise the dispersion of ve cells we have compared the number, the size and the position of the clusters per labelled conceptus. at the early egg cylinder stage and e <dig> , the number of clusters in the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions was similar and relatively low . in contrast between e <dig>  and e <dig>  cell dispersion in the ve was significantly enhanced, in particular in the embryonic region where the number of clusters significantly increased . after e <dig> , dispersion also occurred in the extra-embryonic region, yet to a lesser extent . taken together these results suggest that it is only after e <dig> , when the ave has initiated its migration, that different growth modes can be distinguished in the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions, such that dispersion of ve cells is more pronounced in the embryonic region.

anterior visceral endoderm cells have a polyclonal origin
we have shown that the embryonic region of the ve is characterised by extensive cell mixing. yet a group of cells in this region, the ave, shares specific properties such as a columnar cell shape and expression of specific markers including lefty <dig> and cer <dig>  in addition, it has been shown that lefty <dig> is already expressed in some icm cells of the blastocyst  <cit> , raising the question of whether ave cells have a common precursor in the blastocyst. alternatively the ave may arise from distinct mixed clones.

to investigate the origin of cells of the ave, we performed a clonal analysis in the cer1-gfp transgenic line, which marks cells of the ave at e <dig> . we injected surface cells of the icm with an mrna encoding a nuclear red-fluorescent protein. only blastocysts with a single positive cell were transferred into the uterus of a foster mother. conceptuses were collected at e <dig>  and staged depending on the position of cer1-gfp positive cells . the number of cer1-gfp positive cells and the size of the conceptus at each stage was similar to non-injected conceptuses  <cit> . we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> clones of red-positive cells colonised cer1-gfp expressing domain . in all cases these clones colonised only a subset of ave cells, between  <dig> and 27%. to avoid the possibility that the lack of colonisation of the entire ave is due to some cytotoxicity of the red marker , we also carried out an alternative analysis by monitoring ave cells based on their columnar shape  <cit> . among the wild-type e <dig>  conceptuses with labelled gfp cells described earlier,  <dig> were observed in an orientation which permits detection of the vet. in  <dig>  gfp positive cells colonised the vet. in all these cases, only a fraction of the vet was labelled . thus we conclude that the origin of the ave is polyclonal. this is not only true in the blastocyst, but necessarily also for ve cells between e <dig>  and e <dig> . indeed, if a single precursor of ave existed at an intermediate stage, its mother cell in the blastocyst would necessarily contribute to the whole ave in addition to other ve cells. therefore the polyclonal origin of the ave holds true from e <dig>  to e <dig> .

discussion
internalisation of the extra-embryonic ectoderm during egg cylinder formation
systematic dissections from the uterus and analysis of early egg cylinder conceptuses have revealed a folding of the extra-embryonic ectoderm when the blastocyst transforms into the egg cylinder. this unexpected finding supports an earlier observation of "a slight depression on the surface of the trophoblast cone" which "becomes a funnel-shaped cavity", in sections of uterine horns containing conceptuses of similar appearance to those at the early egg cylinder stage in our study  <cit> . based on the age of the conceptuses, we propose a model for the sequence of events leading to the formation of the extra-embryonic ectoderm. at pre-egg cylinder stage, polar trophectoderm cells are being rearranged. the localized accumulation of actin suggests that a contractile apparatus is assembled under the apical surface of polar trophectoderm cells. when it springs into action, it may contribute to the formation and the closure onto itself of the funnel-shaped depression. later, at the early egg cylinder stage, no sign of actin enrichment or tissue depression remains, suggesting that the depression is occluded. it is only later, at e <dig> l/d, that an extra-embryonic cavity forms, by extension of the embryonic pro-amniotic cavity  <cit> . this model is descriptive and determination of the precise mechanism of formation of the extra-embryonic region would require experiments on living embryos. embryos at this early stage are still very difficult to culture and improvement of culture conditions will be necessary to investigate whether folding of the extra-embryonic ectoderm affects every embryo and to characterise further the nature of the contractile apparatus. from a phylogenetic point of view, the formation of a cup-shaped egg cylinder is a characteristic of mouse and some mammalian conceptuses, whereas others, including human or bovine, are planar  <cit> . this is thought to permit compaction of the volume of the conceptus in relation to the increase of litter size. constriction of the polar trophectoderm might underlie this difference in conceptus shape.

additional phenomena such as increased proliferation of cells from the polar trophectoderm  <cit> , may contribute to the transformation of the blastocyst into the egg cylinder. regional differences in cellular proliferation rates and mechanical constraints have been suggested to drive growth in the direction of least resistance, as if the extra-embryonic ectoderm was pushed towards the blastocoelic cavity  <cit> . this would also result in polar trophectoderm derivatives being engulfed by the ve. in this case, the ve of the extra-embryonic region may originate from cells initially covering the epiblast. these would come in contact with the extra-embryonic ectoderm as it is pushed into a territory previously occupied by the epiblast.

conventionally, parietal endoderm is defined as the endoderm cells lining the inner surface of the mural trophectoderm  <cit> . our model implies that some of these cells, after folding of the polar trophectoderm, might cover the extra-embryonic ectoderm and therefore adopt a position characteristic of the ve . this raises the question of where the limit between visceral and parietal endoderm is to be found. different cell morphologies have been observed at day  <dig>  such that parietal endoderm cells are stellate and form a discontinuous layer  <cit> . in our implanted blastocysts and pre-egg cylinder conceptuses , we observe endoderm cells lining the mural trophectoderm, in continuity with the endoderm cells that contact the epiblast, and with a ve-like morphology. the identity of these cells is unclear. even at a later stage, when both tissues have specific markers, cells at the junction between parietal and visceral endoderm, the so-called marginal zone, are ill-defined and show characteristics of both types  <cit> . further studies will be required to understand how the primitive endoderm is segregated between parietal and visceral endoderm.

the junction between embryonic and extra-embryonic ve regions is not a compartmental barrier during egg cylinder growth
the classical difference between ve cells in the extra-embryonic and embryonic regions is histological, the former having columnar shape and the latter a squamous shape  <cit> . we do not observe this difference at the early egg cylinder stage. it becomes only apparent from e <dig>  with the exception of the columnar vet in the embryonic region  <cit> . molecular differences are also observed, and were originally described at e <dig>  based on the expression of genes such as those encoding the glycoprotein α-fetoprotein  <cit>  or the activin receptor actrib  <cit> . it has recently been shown that specific expression of genes in the embryonic region of the ve is first visible at e <dig> , whereas markers of the extra-embryonic region are down-regulated in the embryonic region at e <dig>   <cit> .

we have found that clonally related ve cells may grow across the junction between embryonic and extra-embryonic regions from the early egg cylinder stage to e <dig> . previous studies have shown that, when ave cells reach the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction, they transitorily spread along the junction  <cit>  as if the junction could act as a transitory barrier to cell migration. ave cells may occasionally cross the junction as they spread along it  <cit>  and later, during gastrulation, are displaced into the extra-embryonic region by the forming definitive endoderm  <cit> . this indicates that while the junction affects ave cell migration, it is not a compartmental barrier. taken together these results show that embryonic and extra-embryonic ve regions are not distinct cellular compartments, despite their histological and molecular differences. this suggests that the differences between the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions are not related to the origin and nature of ve cells but are rather controlled by extrinsic signals from the underlying tissues, namely the epiblast and the extra-embryonic ectoderm. this is consistent with the finding that the expression of α-fetoprotein responds to an unknown signal from the extra-embryonic ectoderm  <cit> .

distinct cell behaviour marks embryonic and extra-embryonic regionalisation of the visceral endoderm after ave migration
despite the lack of strict clonal restriction, cells of the ve display distinct growth modes in the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions by e <dig>   <cit> . we show that as soon as e <dig> , coherent growth becomes specific to the extra-embryonic region whereas dispersion is enhanced in the embryonic region. the stage when these regionalised cell patterns appear is similar to that at which histological and molecular regionalisation becomes visible. regionalised growth modes are still observed at later stages when ve in the embryonic region is being replaced by definitive endoderm during gastrulation  <cit> . it has been proposed that proteins of the extra-cellular matrix, hensin and laminin, mediate differences in the cell architecture of columnar and squamous ve  <cit> . variations in the composition of the extra-cellular matrix may well underlie the distinct growth modes that we observe here by regulating cell behaviour such as intercalation, migration or division.

interestingly, perturbation of the formation of the ap axis, by mutation in genes of the wnt  <cit>  or tgfβ  <cit>  pathways inhibits the formation of distinct cell architecture. nodal signalling, which plays a central role in ap axis specification  <cit> , also affects the molecular regionalisation of the ve. nodal is essential for the expression of genes, such as lhx <dig>  specific to the embryonic region of the ve and also to confine the expression of some markers, including furin, to the extra-embryonic region  <cit> . these data suggest that regionalisation of the ve might be linked to the emergence of the ap axis as distinct behaviour of ve cells in the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions becomes pronounced only after migration of the ave.

migration of the ave not only affects the regionalisation of ve cells, but also their behaviour at the embryonic/extra-embryonic junction. we have shown that orientation of labelled clusters at the level of the junction is shifted to become parallel to it. this may be due to new oriented cell division or to rearrangement of neighbouring cells. cell labelling together with time-lapse observations at post-implantation stages have demonstrated that when ave cells reach the anterior embryonic/extra-embryonic junction, they come to an abrupt halt and then start to spread laterally  <cit> . more distal embryonic ve cells are also displaced proximally and blocked at the level of the junction  <cit> . the transverse clusters observed on the embryonic side of the junction are most likely the result of this process. however, such clusters were also observed in the extra-embryonic region indicating that the distal to anterior movement of ave cells restricts the exchange of cells between the extra-embryonic and embryonic regions in both directions. importantly, this appears to be a specificity of the anterior pole, as vertical clusters can span the junction posteriorly.

polyclonal origin of the anterior visceral endoderm
we have assessed the origin of cells of the ave using two criteria to identify this region: expression of a specific molecular marker and distinct morphology. we found that at e <dig>  the cer1-gfp expressing domain and the vet domain are never completely colonised by the descendants of one single surface icm cell. these results show that the ave has a polyclonal origin in the blastocyst.

the cellular composition of the ave is unclear and several criteria are currently used to distinguish this region from the rest of the ve. these include the expression of specific molecular markers encoding transcription factors or secreted proteins from e <dig>  to e <dig>  , its morphology as a localised columnar epithelium at e <dig>   <cit> , the ability of cells to migrate from distal to anterior positions between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> , a low proliferation rate  <cit>  and its requirement for the maintenance of anterior epiblast and neurectoderm fates before and during gastrulation  <cit> . cells in the ave region seem to display heterogeneous characteristics already from e <dig>  when they are first identified at the distal tip of the egg cylinder. indeed at this stage, cells of the vet express hhex in a salt and pepper pattern that does not completely overlap the expression domain of two other ave markers, cer <dig> and lefty <dig>  <cit> . mutations in the different genetic pathways involved in ave specification affect differentially the expression of ave markers, further highlighting the complexity of this region  <cit> . whether the heterogeneity observed in the ave region relates to possible distinct origins, fates and functions remains unknown.

the current view of how the ave region is specified is that nodal signalling from the epiblast is required for the formation of this specialised ve population at the distal tip of the e <dig>  egg cylinder  <cit>  and that a signal derived from the extra-embryonic ectoderm is necessary to prevent the ectopic expression of ave markers in the rest of the ve  <cit> . some genes marking the ave at e <dig>  like hhex, cerl and lefty <dig> are already expressed in the e <dig>  icm and in the e <dig>  primitive endoderm though with slightly different patterns  <cit> . although the lineage of these cells is still unknown, these findings raise the question of whether ave cells are specified during peri-implantation stages, before they can be morphologically identified at e <dig> . our results help to understand the origin of the ave as they demonstrate that all ave cells at e <dig>  are not derived from a single surface icm precursor in the e <dig>  blastocyst. whether there is a stage between e <dig>  and e <dig>  at which some ve cells will only give rise to descendants in the ave remains to be understood. further work will be required to clarify the timing and mechanisms of ave specification. in particular it will be interesting to determine whether the complexity of the ave cell population at e <dig>  results from sequential steps of specification taking place during peri-implantation and early post-implantation development.

CONCLUSIONS
we have analysed the formation of the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions of the conceptus as the blastocyst transforms into the egg cylinder. we show that the extra-embryonic region is clearly visible at the early egg cylinder stage and that its formation involves a folding of the extra-embryonic ectoderm. using a cell labelling approach we find that the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions of the ve do not correspond to distinct cellular compartments, and that growth is not restricted across their junction even after the appearance of histological and molecular differences by e <dig> . our results suggest that the distinct characteristics observed in the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions of the ve are regulated by extrinsic signals, possibly from the adjacent epiblast and extra-embryonic ectoderm respectively, from e <dig> . thus, despite their common origin ve regions are characterised by distinct cell behaviour such that cell dispersion is more pronounced in the embryonic region after the migration of the ave. at this time, ve cell clusters at the junction between the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions are reoriented to become parallel to it. our clonal analysis of the ave demonstrates for the first time that this anterior signalling centre arises from more than a single precursor between e <dig>  and e <dig> .
