BACKGROUND
human peripheral blood monocytes are derived from myeloid progenitors in bone marrow. after their maturation, they migrate to the periphery and form approximately 5-10% of human leukocytes. monocytes circulate in the blood stream for several days and then enter to peripheral tissues where they undergo a phenotypic change and differentiate further into macrophages or dendritic cells   <cit> . in tissues, macrophages have a central role to locally phagocytose and destroy pathogens, to clear senescent cells and to repair tissues after the inflammatory processes  <cit> . activated macrophages show strong inflammatory responses through the high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased endocytic and antigen presentation activity. similarly to macrophages, dcs are located in peripheral tissues where they encounter and phagocytose microbes. the recognition of microbial antigen occurs in the immature state of dcs and leads to a maturation process, after which they have increased antigen presentation but downregulated antigen recognition capacity. the maturation is often accompanied with the migration of dcs to secondary lymphoid organs  <cit>  and several murine dc subsets with variable phenotype, function or tissue locations have been reported  <cit> .

the peripheral blood monocytes exhibit a heterogeneous phenotype with respect to their size and nuclear morphology. they can be relatively easily identified by high expression of the cell surface marker cd <dig> and can be divided into at least two major subpopulations according to their cd <dig> expression  <cit> . dcs derived from monocytes are particularly important during inflammatory processes and are efficient in stimulating cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive t cell responses  <cit> . recent studies showed that monocytes can also differentiate into macrophages and dcs under non-inflammatory conditions and that several subsets of antigen presenting cells located in antigen capture areas, such as skin, mucosa, gastrointestinal and respiratory track, are in fact derived from monocytes  <cit> . to generate a large number of human macrophages or dcs, monocytes are typically cultured for several days in the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor  alone or gm-csf with interleukin  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . although these culture conditions give rise to only one subset of differentiated cells and do not represent the full heterogeneity of macrophages or dcs in vivo, it still is the most efficient way to obtain human antigen presenting cells. furthermore, monocyte-derived dcs are by far the most common type of cells used in immunotherapeutic clinical approaches  <cit> .

histone modifications within promoter regions have an important function in regulation of gene expression  <cit> . the majority of modifications occur at the n-terminal ends of the core histones in a nucleosome. these modifications are often dynamic as well as reversible and have a functional impact on many aspects of chromatin accessibility that may determine the transcriptional status of a given gene. one of the most frequent histone modifications is the trimethylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> , which in gene promoters is usually associated with the transcriptional activation, whereas the trimethylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  generally results in gene silencing. the presence of these two opposing modifications as bivalent marks on promoters is often associated with poised gene transcription. similar to the h3k4me <dig> mark, the acetylation of lysines on histone h <dig>  is often associated with transcriptional activation  <cit> . how exactly these combinations of chromatin modifications translate to gene transcription is currently under extensive investigation in several cell types. transcriptional control is further mediated by chromatin associated proteins; for example h3k4me <dig> may serve as a docking site for phd finger domain and ach <dig> for bromodomains  <cit> .

here we studied the histone h3k4me <dig>  ach <dig> and h3k27me <dig> modifications in human monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and dcs. to gain insight into the role of these modifications during the differentiation process, we compared genome-wide gene expression profiles with histone changes in promoter regions over the genome. we show that h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks generally correlate well with gene expression and that h3k27me <dig> is associated with inactive genes. we also show that h3k4me <dig> levels are increased on the promoters of several marker genes and gene groups during differentiation. in addition, we provide evidence that the chromatin statuses of gene families within genomic clusters, including chemokine and surface receptor genes, are coordinately modified.

RESULTS
genome-wide mrna expression profiles
we first identified the expression profiles of monocytes, macrophages and dcs using the illumina human- <dig> v <dig> beadchip expression array. overall, the gene expression profiles in these three cell subsets were similar with a high correlation coefficient . however, we found a significantly higher correlation between the expression profiles of macrophage and dcs than between monocytes and macrophages or monocytes and dcs. when we used a selection criteria of a 2-fold change and differential p value less than  <dig> , we found that compared to monocytes, a similar number of genes were upregulated in macrophages and dcs . this represents 8% of the total number  of human genes . approximately the same proportion of all genes were also downregulated during macrophage  or dc  differentiation. the majority of upregulated  or downregulated  genes in macrophage and dc cultures overlapped, indicating again a similarity between the two cell populations.

according to the expression array, the monocyte population had a very high expression of cd <dig>  ccr <dig>  csf1r and sell/cd62l mrna, which were all downregulated after the differentiation to macrophages or dcs . in contrast, marker genes specific for human cd16+ monocyte subpopulation, fcgr3a/cd16a and fcgr3b/cd16b, were expressed at low levels. in both macrophage and dc populations, we observed a highly increased expression of surface marker tm7sf4/dc-stamp, trem <dig> and chemokine ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> transcripts. in dcs, several additional surface markers such as cd209/dc-sign, slam and cd <dig> family genes, were strongly upregulated, as well as the chemokines ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  altogether, the expression array data showed that macrophages and dcs share similar global mrna expression pattern that is different from their monocyte precursors.

*illumina beadstudio differential expression score indicates statistical difference between expression levels. the differential score > <dig> corresponds to statistically significant change with p-value less than  <dig> . positive values correspond to upregulation and negative values to downregulation of expression.

genome-wide chromatin profiling of promoter regions
to investigate the correlation between gene expression profiles and histone modifications in monocytes, macrophages and dcs, we used a high-resolution promoter microarray screen with immunoprecipitated chromatin . cells were cross-linked and chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and ach <dig>  as well as to general h <dig>  the immunoprecipitated material was then hybridized to the nimblegen promoter array covering  <dig> gene promoters in the human genome that overlap with  <dig> genes on the illumina human- <dig> v <dig> beadchip expression array. the chip-chip data with each modification-specific antibody was further normalized to random genomic background and to general h <dig> 

we first studied the occupancy and position of h3k4me <dig>  ach <dig> and h3k27me <dig> marks in relation to transcription start sites within the promoter regions. h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> signals coincided up to  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream showing almost complete overlap on both sides of the transcriptional start sites . this pattern was different from h3k27me <dig>  which was distributed more equally over the promoter areas. the transcriptional start site itself had remarkably lower h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> levels, however, h3k27me <dig> signals that associate with silenced genes  were not significantly decreased at the transcription start sites.

h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> have a high correlation on gene promoters
we next analyzed the correlation between three marks in three cell populations. as shown in figure  <dig>  there was a highly significant correlation between h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> in three cell populations, while the h3k27me <dig> mark was present on a distinct pool of gene promoters. the most prevalent mark was the h3k4me <dig> present on 45% of all genes in monocytes, slightly less in macrophages  and even less in dcs  . the ach <dig> mark was found in three cell subsets with nearly equal frequency, being present on 30-32% of gene promoters. of these three modifications, the h3k27me <dig> mark had the lowest frequency, and we found it more often in monocytes  or dcs  than in macrophages . notably, a substantial proportion, more than one third  of gene promoters, lacked the histone modifications that were studied here. as expected, the most prevalent combination in all cells was the double h3k4me3/ach <dig> mark  whereas the combination of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> was present in only 5-6% of gene promoters . a notable proportion of genes  was positive for the h3k27me <dig> modification alone.

transcriptionally active genes have a double modification of h3k4me <dig> and ach3
the h3k4me <dig> modification often overlaps with the ach <dig> mark on active genes, but in combination with h3k27me <dig>  it often marks genes poised for either activation or repression  <cit> . we therefore analyzed the presence of histone marks among a subset of transcriptionally active genes . similar to all genes in the genome, the most common combination among expressed genes was the h3k4me3/ach <dig> modification present in 33-38% of expressed gene promoters. the double h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> trimethylation, marking so-called bivalent poised genes was present in 4-5% of genes; however, a mark for silenced genes, h3k27me <dig> alone, was clearly decreased  among expressed genes. interestingly, we noted that during the differentiation from monocytes to dcs, the proportion of genes with h3k4me <dig> alone decreased from 14% to 5%, in contrast to the ach <dig> mark, which increased from 2% to 6% . these changes, albeit to a lesser extent, also occurred in macrophage differentiation . modifications on transcriptionally inactive genes were clearly different; the main modification on these gene promoters was h3k27me <dig> alone  or in combination with h3k4me <dig> . only 7% to 8% of genes had the double h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> mark .

we next analyzed chip-chip data in relation to gene expression levels to see the correlation of modifications with gene activity. analysis of the  <dig> most highly expressed genes in monocytes revealed that a vast majority of genes have either the h3k4me <dig> or the ach <dig> modification, 89% and 67% respectively, on their promoter whereas only 10% have the h3k27me <dig> mark . a highly significant correlation of h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks with a high expression level was also seen in macrophage and dc populations. though when compared to monocytes, the proportion of genes in dcs with the h3k4me <dig> modification was lower  but higher with the ach <dig> mark . the positive correlation between an increased expression level and h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks was even stronger among the top  <dig> most highly expressed genes . in contrast, among the  <dig> lowly expressed genes, we saw a correlation with the h3k27me <dig> modification in all three cell populations , while the number of genes having both the h3k4me <dig> and the ach <dig> marks was clearly smaller than in the  <dig> highly expressed genes . it should be noted that the number of genes without any of the three marks was rather similar in both subsets of expressed genes.

*frequency of marks is shown as % of the genes either with high or low expression.

histone marks h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> alone are unstable
histone modifications are highly dynamic. we therefore analyzed the dynamics of histone modifications during differentiation from monocytes to macrophages or dcs. when we followed the presence of histone modifications alone or in combination with each other during differentiation, we found that the most prevalent mark characteristic for active genes, the double h3k4me3/ach <dig>  often persisted on genes throughout the differentiation process . however, we noted a striking decrease of h3k4me <dig> or ach <dig> modifications when occurring alone. for example, when present alone in monocytes, the h3k4me <dig> mark was usually lost or turned into double mark by an additional acetylation of 72% or 86% of corresponding genes in macrophages or dcs, respectively. similarly, 84-85% of genes with the ach <dig> mark alone in monocytes lost this modification status during differentiation to macrophages or dcs. in contrast, the h3k27me <dig> modification alone was relatively stable but less so when occurring in combination with h3k4me <dig> . together, these results demonstrate a dynamic nature of histone modifications during differentiation, and that the h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> modifications alone lead to either a loss of one of these marks or a gain of the h3k4me3/ach <dig> combinatorial mark.

modifications on marker genes often correlate with transcriptional activity
to study the chromatin changes of genes associated with macrophage and dc differentiation, we analyzed the histone modifications on the promoters of several well-established marker genes . for example, cd <dig> and cd <dig> genes had double h3k4me3/ach <dig> mark on their promoters in monocytes, where they are expressed at high levels, but in agreement with their transcriptional downregulation, they lost these marks after differentiation. cd8a and cd8b genes were not expressed in any of these cells and were marked by repressive h3k27me <dig> modification. the gene encoding costimulatory ligand cd <dig> is relatively highly expressed in all three cell types and has double h3k4me3/ach <dig> mark but functionally related cd <dig> gene, which is expressed at lower level, was marked by ach <dig> only. also, the highly expressed integrin marker itgam/cd11b had the h3k4me <dig> modification in monocytes as well as macrophages and acquired the additional ach <dig> mark in dcs. the expression of itgal/cd11a decreased during differentiation with a corresponding loss of h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks in dcs. active h3k4me3/ach <dig> chromatin marks were also present on integrin itgax/cd11c and sirpa genes. in contrast, the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> genes did not correlate with histone modifications .

genes related to phagocytosis and antigen presentation have active chromatin marks
phagocytosis and antigen presentation are the two most central functions of monocytes and monocyte-derived cells. we therefore studied the histone modifications of genes involved in these two key categories of antigen presenting cells in correlation with their expression levels. out of  <dig> genes associated with phagocytic function, the double h3k4me3/ach <dig> mark was present on  <dig> promoters in monocytes, on  <dig> promoters in macrophage and on  <dig> promoters in dc populations . also, a majority of the  <dig> genes associated with antigen presentation, including hla , beta-2-microglobulin , proteasome-associated  and peptide transporter  had the double h3k4me3/ach <dig> mark on their promoters  . these data are in good agreement with the general functionality of antigen-presenting cells, where monocytes and macrophages are more active in phagocytic activities while macrophages and dcs are more efficient in antigen presentation.

a majority of active transcription factor promoters have the h3k4me <dig> mark
we next studied histone modifications on genes associated with transcriptional processes. a majority of the expressed transcription factor genes had the h3k4me <dig> modification on their promoter, often together with the ach <dig> mark, and a few with the h3k27me <dig> . more specifically, the upregulated transcription factors bhlhe41/bhlhb <dig> , egr <dig> , epas1/hif2a , and msc  had the bivalent h3k4me3/h3k27me <dig> mark in monocytes; however, the h3k27me <dig> mark was lost in macrophages and dcs. other upregulated transcriptional factors such as pir , esr <dig> , hes <dig>  and irf <dig>  and klf <dig>  maintained the h3k27me <dig> mark even after their upregulation during differentiation. interestingly, the ets family member ehf/ese- <dig> did not have any modification. notably, many transcription factor families involved in differentiation or lineage-specific regulation in other cell types or tissues were marked with the silencing h3k27me <dig> mark . for example, 38/ <dig> hox, 20/ <dig> fox, 11/ <dig> sox, 9/ <dig> pax, 8/ <dig> lhx, 5/ <dig> six, 8/ <dig> pou, 6/ <dig> nkx, 5/ <dig> irx, 6/ <dig> neuro and 5/ <dig> gata family transcription factors were positive for the h3k27me <dig> modification in all three cell populations. this also correlated with the overall transcriptionally inactive status in all three cell types.

next we used the program opossum to compare the occurrence of transcription factor binding motifs in gene promoters with and without histone modifications. we found a remarkable enrichment of ets and c2h <dig> zinc finger family transcription factor sites in gene promoters enriched with ach <dig> modifications. the genes with h3k4me <dig> marks were enriched for homeobox and high mobility group  box transcription factor binding sites. it is likely that the presence of these transcription factors binding sites reflects their activity in recruitment of histone modifier proteins to the promoters  <cit> .

the h3k4me <dig> modification correlates with the expression in gene clusters
we noticed that while many genes had lower peak scores, they still gained or lost their histone modifications during differentiation. this was particularly evident with many cell surface marker and chemokine genes. to identify these changes on all promoters, we subtracted the monocyte-specific peak scores from those identified in macrophages or dcs. this additional normalization identified further changes that were not apparent by standard peak identification. the profiling by gene ontology indicated that the gain of h3k4me <dig> mark often occurs on genes associated with signal transduction, inflammation and chemokine activity both in macrophages and dcs after the differentiation whereas the ach <dig> was more associated with cell cycle, general mrna processing and gene expression regulation . we then studied changes among specific gene groups that were up- or downregulated during differentiation. the h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> modifications were clearly decreased among monocyte marker genes, such as cd <dig>  ccr <dig>  cx3cr <dig> and sell. in both macrophage and dc subsets, we found a prominent increase in h3k <dig> methylation among their marker genes tm7sf4/dc-stamp, trem <dig> and cd209/dc-sign . in addition to these individual genes, we identified several gene families that showed either a gain or loss of the h3k4me <dig> mark. many of these gene families were located in genomic clusters. for example, we noticed that a gene clusters encoding upregulated chemokines ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> on chromosome 17q <dig>  and ccl <dig>  cx3cl <dig> and ccl <dig> on chromosome 16q <dig> predominantly showed the increased h3k4me <dig> levels in macrophages and dcs . furthermore, the h3k <dig> methylation levels were modified in several other gene clusters associated with inflammatory and cell-cell interaction functions. we found increased h3k <dig> methylation in the clusters for:  <dig> family members of the cd <dig> transmembrane proteins that are structurally related to hla,  <dig> complement subunit c1q genes and  <dig> genes belonging to the slam family receptors that modulate t-cell responses as costimulatory signaling proteins . genes from these clusters were all upregulated in macrophages and dcs. in contrast, the genes from clusters of the cd <dig> inhibitory receptor family and the ifitm genes encoding interferon-inducible membrane proteins were downregulated and showed reduced h3k4me <dig> levels in macrophages and dcs . interestingly, in many of these clusters we found that the h3k4me <dig> changes were similar in macrophages and dcs in spite of their differences in expression levels. this suggests that chromatin changes are needed to induce a permissive chromatin state on gene promoters during differentiation, and that the mrna expression levels of each individual gene is further regulated by other factors.

to confirm the chip-chip data, we studied the h3k4me <dig> modification on several marker gene promoters by conventional chip assay. as expected, the cd <dig> gene showed reduced whereas the tm7sf4/dc-stamp, trem <dig>  cd209/dc-sign and cd1a gene promoters demonstrated increased levels of h3k4me <dig> . similarly, the chemokine genes ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> showed strongly elevated levels of the h3k4me <dig> marks. this increase in h3k4me <dig> on chemokine genes was also present in macrophages, albeit at lower level. taken together, our results demonstrate that several marker genes and clustered gene families, including cell surface receptors and cc chemokines that are activated during differentiation into macrophages and dcs, show the increase in h3k <dig> methylation on their promoters.

discussion
the recent advent of new technologies analyzing genome-wide chromatin changes has greatly improved our understanding of gene regulation and control. these global approaches provide a large-scale picture to the extent of changes and can be used for further dissection of gene-specific modifications. our genome-wide mrna expression profile and map of three major histone modifications associated with gene expression in monocytes, macrophages and dcs are an addition to previous studies in immune cells  <cit> .

we found a high concordance rate between two active promoter marks, h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig>  in all three populations. furthermore, the overall density of h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks on promoter regions displayed a similar pattern, with two elevated peaks surrounding transcription start site and a significant decline at the point of transcription, representing reduced levels of h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> in a region covered by rna polymerase ii and other regulatory proteins  <cit> . as the respective peaks of h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks by and large coincide, it is likely that they also often co-occur in the same nucleosomes. thus, our data confirm a tight association of h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> modifications with permissive chromatin for transcription in antigen-presenting cells. in contrast, h3k27me <dig> had an overall very low concordance with active marks and was equally distributed over the promoter regions with only slight decline at transcription start site.

the h3k4me <dig> mark was clearly a predominant modification on gene promoters, and most commonly was coupled with ach <dig>  this is in agreement with the earlier reported genome-wide studies from embryonic stem cells  <cit> , cd4+ and cd8+ t cells  <cit> , all reporting h3k4me <dig> as the most characteristic modification in promoter regions. the h3k4me <dig> mark was also strongly correlated with the transcriptional activity of a gene. interestingly, we noticed a gradual decrease of the h3k4me <dig> mark among active genes during the differentiation of monocytes to dcs, and accordingly, the number of genes without any modification increased. it should be noted that the global number of genes with a detectable expression signal between the three cell populations did not change significantly. this suggests that during differentiation, a subset of genes lose their h3k4me <dig> mark independently of their gene expression and also hints at a highly dynamic nature of histone modifications during differentiation. when studying the dynamics of histone modifications, we found that both the h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks are unstable when they occur alone and are prone to either lose the modification  or to gain another permissive mark. in contrast, having the combination of both the h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks in a gene promoter was highly stable, and the majority of genes having this combination of histone marks in monocytes also had it in macrophages and dc. the overall decrease of the h3k4me <dig> mark and the reciprocal increase of genes with or without the h3k27me <dig> mark in the dc population suggests that the ex vivo differentiation in the presence of il- <dig> induces a global shift towards less active chromatin.

at the single gene level we found many differences in histone modification profiles, in particular between monocytes and in vitro cultivated cells, which correlate with their transcriptional changes. as expected, the expression levels of many marker genes showed a good correlation with the presence of active histone modifications. when we analyzed the gain or loss of marks during differentiation, we found a remarkable decline in the h3k4me <dig> mark on several monocyte-specific marker genes and a corresponding increase in promoters of dc-specific genes. the prominent exceptions were the cd <dig> and cd <dig> genes, which were not associated with any histone mark. similar to marker genes, the genes associated with antigen presentation activity and phagocytosis were expressed at high levels and had either the h3k4me <dig> or ach <dig> mark. notably, genes that are associated with phagocytosis had more permissive h3k4me3/ach <dig> mark in their promoters in the monocyte population, whereas the genes associated with antigen presentation had more h3k4me3/ach <dig> mark in macrophages and dcs. although there was no dramatic difference between the cell populations in general, this correlation of histone modifications argues in favor of the role of histone modifications in these two key functions of antigen-presenting cells. in case of transcription factors, the situation was more complex, and in many cases the pattern of transcriptional activity of the gene did not match with expected histone modifications. however, the silencing h3k27me <dig> modification marked a vast majority of transcription factors involved in development or lineage decision in other cell types.

in our analysis, we identified several genomic clusters with changes in their chromatin status suggesting that histone modifications in genomic loci are coordinately regulated. in particular, we found that in macrophages and dcs, h3k4me <dig> levels increased in a large genomic cluster of proinflammatory and chemotactic cc chemokines on chromosomes 17q <dig>  and 16q <dig>  <cit> . typically, cc chemokines attract mononuclear cells and/or are induced in an inflammatory environment, thus our findings suggest the requirement of histone modifications on chemokine gene clusters for their responses to inflammatory situations. these changes in h3k4me <dig> modifications were not limited to chemokine gene clusters as we found similar changes in other gene clusters involved in inflammatory processes . interestingly, we noted that even when the gene expression levels in macrophages and dcs differed, the histone marks in these two cell populations were often similar. this indicates that the histone modification status might be established before the actual expression of the gene and serve as a prerequisite for rapid activation by gene-specific transcription factors upon inflammatory stimuli. however, changes in chromatin modifications may also occur during subsequent activation steps. for example, studies in murine bone marrow derived macrophages showed that genes induced by tlr <dig> stimulation can be divided into two subclasses based on their gene-specific activation and histone h <dig> acetylation  <cit> . our work here provides a basis for the further studies to address the role of histone modifications in chemokine and other gene clusters in human macrophages and dcs after the activation with inflammatory stimuli.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of genome-wide promoter analysis of h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and ach <dig> histone modifications in monocyte-derived macrophage and dcs show specific correlation between the expression of functional gene groups, including marker and chemokine genes, and their chromatin state on promoters. our data describe several differences of h3k4me <dig> modification profiles in monocytes, macrophages and dcs but also suggest that the chromatin status of functionally important gene clusters is coordinately modified. together, the results provide a functional correlation between gene expression and histone modifications in monocyte-derived macrophages and dcs.
