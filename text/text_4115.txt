BACKGROUND
the hypersensitive necrosis response  elicited by incompatible plant-pathogen interactions is thought to be a form of programmed cell death. several of the features diagnostic for programmed cell death, such as nuclear condensation, dna fragmentation and cytoplast shrinkage have been observed in plants cells undergoing hr  <cit> .

searches of sequenced plant genomes for plant orthologs of animal programmed cell death genes have identified only one gene that resembles its animal counterpart, the bax inhibitor  <dig> gene, suggesting that components of the regulation and execution of programmed cell death differ substantially between animals and plants  <cit> . in spite of this conclusion, several observations suggest that plant and animal programmed cell death processes share some properties. expression of the bax pro-apoptotic factor in plants causes cell death and the plant bax inhibitor  <dig> suppresses this cell death  <cit> . inhibitors known to block the action of caspases in animals are effective at limiting hr in plants  <cit> . recently, vacuolar processing enzyme gamma was identified as the functional equivalent of animal caspases  <cit> . in addition, beclin <dig>  an ortholog of the yeast and animal autophagy genes atg6/beclin <dig>  was identified by the run-away cell death observed in beclin1-deficient mutants following pathogen attack. the ability of plant beclin <dig> to restrict cell death was dependent on several other autophagy-related genes providing another point of similarity between plant and animal programmed cell death  <cit> . finally, sphingolipids have been implicated in cell death in both plants and animals. the fungal toxin fumonisin b <dig>  which blocks ceramide biosynthesis in animals and elicits programmed cell death response, exerts a similar effect on plants  <cit> . similarly, aal toxin, a host-selective toxin produced by alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici  causes cell death in both plants and animals and appears to target the same step in ceramide biosynthesis as fumonisin b <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the acd <dig> and acd <dig> mutants, which exhibit constitutive cell death, carry mutations in genes encoding a ceramide kinase and a sphingosine transfer protein, respectively  <cit> .

these similarities are not sufficient to provide a complete understanding of programmed cell death or the hr in plants. lesion mimic mutants, displaying spontaneous lesions, have been recovered in screens for mutants with deregulated cell death and have arisen in screens for mutants with altered disease resistance properties  <cit> . among the cloned genes are those that resemble resistance genes  that appear to be constitutively activated. cop , lsd <dig> , and barley mlo  may be involved in the signaling of cell death. also, mutations in several metabolic genes  , lin <dig> , acd <dig> ) exhibit spontaneous lesions. notable among these metabolic genes are the sphingolipid metabolism genes acd <dig> and acd <dig> mentioned above. in addition, mutations of genes encoding a number of novel proteins  lead to spontaneous lesioning phenotypes.

in addition to the lesion mimic mutants, a few mutants have been described that do not develop spontaneous lesions but rather display hr-like lesions only in response to a stimulus such as pathogen attack. enhanced disease resistant  <dig> -edr <dig> are examples of such mutants  <cit> . edr <dig> and edr <dig>  but not edr <dig>  also show elevated defense responses  following powdery mildew attack. these phenotypes were suppressed in mutants with defects in the salicylic acid  signal transduction pathway  but not by those with defects in the ethylene/jasmonate pathway , suggesting that these mutants are hypersensitive to or have a lower threshold for responding to stress and activating the sa pathway. edr <dig> encodes a ctr-like kinase, edr <dig> a novel protein, and edr <dig> a dynamin-like protein   <cit> . the edr <dig> and edr <dig> mutants have a second phenotype that is sa-independent; they are hyper-sensitive to ethylene-induced senescence, implicating these two genes in the regulation of senescence as well as defense signaling  <cit> . the diverse nature of processes interrupted in these mutants suggests that much remains to be uncovered about the mechanisms controlling cell death in plants.

we initiated a screen for mutants that developed an exaggerated cell death response following inoculation with the powdery mildew fungus, golovinomyces cichoracearum  as a means of identifying components of the hr programmed cell death. lesion mimic mutants with spontaneous lesions were discarded from this screen to minimize the likelihood of recovering mutants with a metabolic dysfunction or that were compromised in the mechanisms protecting plants from the oxidative stress that arises during photosynthesis. these mutants were named mildew-induced lesions  mutants and below we describe the characterization of the mil <dig> mutant and cloning of mil <dig> gene. during the course of this work, edr <dig> was cloned and as described below shown to be the gene compromised in the mil <dig> mutant  <cit> . for this reason, we have renamed mil <dig> edr2- <dig> 

RESULTS
edr <dig> exhibits a late acting resistance phenotype associated with cell death
the edr2- <dig> mutant was indistinguishable from wild type in growth and development up to ~ <dig> weeks of age . the wild type remained free of lesions whether inoculated with the powdery mildew pathogen or not . the mutant did not develop lesions spontaneously. it only became chlorotic and formed lesions at infection sites and did not support visible fungal growth . the lesions on edr2- <dig> leaves did not spread to non-infected parts of inoculated leaves or to uninoculated leaves of the same plant . at later stages, the petioles of edr2- <dig> leaves were slightly shorter and the leaves tended to be crinkled .

the severity of the edr2- <dig> phenotype varied with inoculation density. fungal growth measurements up to  <dig> days post-inoculation  obtained under very low inoculation densities  are similar on col- <dig> and edr2- <dig> . similarly, their macroscopic phenotypes were identical up to this time point . by contrast, when fungal growth was monitored at  <dig> dpi under high inoculum density , the mutant and wild type were clearly distinguished with wild type supporting significantly more fungal growth than edr2- <dig>  under these conditions, wild-type leaves had an average of  <dig> ±  <dig> conidiophores per mm <dig>  whereas the edr2- <dig> mutant had  <dig> ±  <dig> conidiophores per mm <dig> .

the timing of macroscopic lesion formation in the mutant varied with inoculation density and, as also reported by tang et al.  <cit> , occurred relatively late in the infection cycle compared to the rapid hr  typically elicited by incompatible interactions governed by plant resistance and pathogen avirulence genes. macroscopically, the first lesions appeared  <dig> dpi at high inoculation densities and  <dig> dpi at low inoculation densities. the wild-type plants did not develop visible lesions upon powdery mildew infection regardless of inoculum density. fungal infection eventually led to an apparent acceleration of senescence in a density-dependent fashion in both wild type and mutant, but the amount of chlorosis was greater in the mutant. at  <dig> dpi, leaves infected with ~ <dig> conidia per mm <dig>  had  <dig> % ±  <dig> % chlorotic tissue in the wild type, whereas the edr2- <dig> leaves had  <dig> % ±  <dig> % chlorotic and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % necrotic tissue . the amount of necrotic tissue in the mutant also correlated with the inoculation density. thus, at  <dig> dpi with ~ <dig> conidia per mm <dig>  the edr2- <dig> mutant had  <dig> % ±  <dig> % chlorotic tissue and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % necrotic tissue .

cell death was also monitored microscopically at various time points during the infection process under high inoculation density. in wild-type plants, no macroscopic lesions were observed upon inoculation with g. cichoracearum and only rare groups of more than three collapsed mesophyll cells were observed  <dig> dpi . up to  <dig> dpi, edr2- <dig> leaves were indistinguishable from wild type, with no apparent cell death. by  <dig> dpi, a few isolated epidermal and mesophyll cells appeared dead in edr2- <dig> and were usually associated with fungal hyphae. the first small groups of dead mesophyll cells  also appeared  <dig> dpi. from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, these lesions were more frequent, and increased in size  .

the occurrences of hydrogen peroxide and callose, which typically accumulate in cells that undergo an hr, were assessed. in both wild-type and edr2- <dig> plants, hydrogen peroxide and callose were present at the fungal penetration sites . in wild type, both compounds were found in papillae, cell wall appositions deposited by the plant at sites of attempted penetration. both compounds also accumulated in whole cells, predominantly in edr2- <dig> leaves, following the pattern already observed for the appearance of dead cells. autofluorescent compounds, believed to be antimicrobial molecules, also accumulated in whole edr2- <dig> cells in a similar pattern to that observed for the appearance of dead cells .

lesion formation in edr2- <dig> is only induced by biotic stresses
blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei, the barley powdery mildew, which is not a pathogen of arabidopsis, was also able to induce macroscopic lesion formation in edr2- <dig>  but not col- <dig> . in edr2- <dig> mutants, the number of dead cells was comparable to wild type until  <dig> dpi. by  <dig> dpi, the first small lesions occurred at high inoculation densities and increased in size until  <dig> dpi .

to ascertain whether lesion formation on edr2- <dig> leaves was specifically triggered by pathogen infection, plants were treated with several types of abiotic stress . no macroscopic or microscopic lesions were observed after any of these treatments as determined by visual observation and trypan blue staining . after wounding, the amount and the localization of dead cells were comparable in col- <dig> and in edr2- <dig>  and no spreading cell death was observed in the mutant.

edr2- <dig> mutants are resistant to some but not all pathogens
a number of lesion mimic mutants exhibit resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens. to determine the resistance specificity of edr2- <dig>  mutant plants were challenged with an oomycete pathogen, hyaloperonospora parasitica, and a bacterial pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc <dig>  the level of edr2- <dig> resistance to a biotrophic h. parasitica emco <dig> was evaluated by counting the number of sporangia per cotyledon at  <dig> dpi. at high inoculum concentration , the wild type had  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sporangia per cotyledon, whereas the edr2- <dig> mutant had  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . at lower inoculum concentrations , wild type and mutant were indistinguishable . a second h. parasitica strain, noco <dig>  showed reduced growth and elicited lesions when inoculated onto the leaves of 3-week-old edr2- <dig> plants. the number of spores per mm <dig> were  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for wild type and edr2- <dig>  respectively .

p. syringae tomato dc <dig> multiplies in both col- <dig> and edr2- <dig> plants, eventually producing water-soaked lesions. unlike the response to powdery mildew, the timing and extent of macroscopic and microscopic symptom development were similar for mutant and wild-type plants, regardless of the concentration of inoculum . the estimation of bacterial titers in the infected leaves did not reveal any significant difference between bacterial multiplication rates in col- <dig> and edr2- <dig> . the edr2- <dig> plants, which carry the rps <dig> resistance gene, mounted a normal hypersensitive necrosis response following infiltration with the avirulent bacterial strain carrying the avrrpt <dig> gene . similar results were reported by tang et al.  <cit> . the loss of edr <dig> function did not interfere with the ability of the plants to mount a normal hr.

edr2- <dig> plants do not exhibit constitutively active defense responses
some lesion mimic mutants are disease resistant because defenses, including the sa signal transduction pathway, are constitutively activated  <cit> . similar to the results of tang et al.  <cit> , pr <dig> transcript levels, a marker for the sa pathway, in uninfected edr2- <dig> plants were negligible and similar to uninfected wild-type plants, indicating that the sa pathway was not constitutively activated in the mutant. after  <dig> dpi, pr <dig> expression was induced in both wild-type and mutant plants and pr <dig> levels remained high up to  <dig> dpi . the level of pr <dig> induction was two-fold higher in edr2- <dig> relative to col- <dig> plants at every time point suggesting possibly that edr2- <dig> mutants are predisposed to respond to a stimulus activating the sa pathway. this stimulus may be lesion formation as sa levels increase following treatments that induce lesions  <cit> .

pr <dig> levels were also monitored in plants treated with sa and the sa mimic, bth. as expected, these treatments induced pr <dig> expression in both col- <dig> and edr2- <dig>  however, in the mutant plants, pr <dig> gene expression was two-fold higher than in wild-type plants . the same trend in pr <dig> up-regulation occurred in edr2- <dig> plants infected with the virulent bacterium p. syringae tomato dc <dig>  in a dosage dependent manner .

the transcript levels of the pdf <dig>  gene encoding an anti-microbial defensin, a marker for the jasmonate/ethylene signal transduction pathway, over the time course used for pr <dig> gene expression analysis were not significantly different between edr2- <dig> and col- <dig> .

both the resistance and lesion phenotypes are dependent on the sa pathway
to analyze the involvement of the major defense signaling pathways, double mutants with defects in the sa or jasmonate/ethylene pathways were analyzed for their resistance and lesion phenotype. resistance was lost in plants expressing the nahg gene and in the edr2- <dig> pad4- <dig> double mutant . similar to edr2- <dig>  the double mutants edr2- <dig> coi1- <dig> and edr2- <dig> ein2- <dig> did not support fungal growth and showed lesion formation . at the microscopic level, the lesion phenotype was not suppressed by the coi1- <dig> or ein2- <dig> mutations , but was lost in edr2- <dig> plants expressing nahg and in the edr2- <dig> pad4- <dig> double mutant . thus, the sa pathway contributes to lesion formation and the resistance phenotype in edr2- <dig> mutants. since g. cichoracearum is an obligate biotrophic pathogen, requiring living host tissue for growth, the resistance phenotype is likely a consequence in part of the inability of the chlorotic and lesioned tissue to support growth of this pathogen.

edr <dig> encodes a novel, ubiquitously expressed protein
the segregation analysis of f <dig> plants from a cross between edr2- <dig> and wild type suggested that the edr2- <dig> mutation was linked to a single t-dna insertion, and that both the disease resistance and the lesion phenotypes of edr2- <dig> following powdery mildew infection were due to a unique recessive mutation . the edr <dig> gene was isolated by cloning the regions flanking the t-dna insert. sequencing revealed that the t-dna was inserted in a predicted intron of gene at4g <dig>  a gene cloned previously as edr <dig>  <cit> . a  <dig> kb fragment covering this putative gene was cloned into a binary ti plasmid and used to transform homozygous edr2- <dig> plants. the wild-type phenotypes  were restored in  <dig>  of the  <dig> t <dig> plants tested . the progeny of six of these t <dig> plants segregated 3: <dig>  for powdery mildew resistance, as expected.

a cdna for the edr <dig> gene was isolated by rt-pcr. its sequence was identical to the ncbi deduced cdna sequence nm_ <dig>  the genomic sequence of edr <dig>  which is composed of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, extends  <dig>  nucleotides. the coding sequence is  <dig>  nucleotides long and encodes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kd. the edr <dig> protein consists of an n-terminal pleckstrin homology  domain , a central region with a star-related lipid-transfer  domain  and a c-terminal, plant-specific, domain of unknown function, duf <dig>    <cit> .

a gene on chromosome v, at5g <dig>  is homologous to edr <dig> with >75% nucleotide identity across the entire gene and approximately 89% identity on the protein level. two other genes in the arabidopsis genome, at2g <dig> and at3g <dig>  are predicted to encode proteins that display the same domain structure as edr <dig> with ph, start and duf <dig> domains. these proteins show relatively little sequence similarity to edr <dig> .

a survey of published gene expression profiling data showed that edr <dig> is expressed in all organs  <cit> , corroborating pedr2:gus expression results from tang et al.  <cit> . its expression did not vary substantially during development, with the exception that in stamens and senescing leaves, edr <dig> transcript levels were ~2–3-fold higher than in most other organs or developmental stages . as observed by tang et al.  <cit> , edr <dig> transcript levels were generally unresponsive to biotic stresses. the highest inductions  were elicited by inoculation with the necrotrophic fungal pathogen, botrytis cinerea, at  <dig> hpi and by the bacterial pathogen, p. syringae tomato dc <dig>  at  <dig> hpi . in contrast, at5g <dig> transcript levels were generally ~1/ <dig> those of edr <dig> during development and in various organs, and mostly below the level of reliable detection in the biotic stress experiments. transcript levels of at3g <dig> were very low and not detected in most organs, developmental stages or under various biotic stresses, with the exception of the stamens, which expressed this gene at levels ~100-fold higher than in most other organs. at2g <dig> was expressed at ~1/ <dig> the level of edr <dig> with its highest transcript levels occurring in mature flower parts. the expression of this latter gene was unresponsive to biotic stresses.

the ph domain of edr <dig> specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in vitro
the ph domain of edr <dig>  expressed as a ph domain-gst fusion protein, had strong in vitro binding affinity for phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate  . very weak binding to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate or phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate was also observed. in the course of cloning the ph domain, we fortuitously obtained a mutant ph-gst construct in which the phenylalanine in position  <dig> was replaced by a serine. this fusion protein completely lacked the ability to bind to pi-4-p, suggesting that this amino acid is important for the pi-4-p binding .

edr <dig> is localized to multiple compartments
a c-terminal egfp fusion construct with expression driven by the native edr <dig> promoter was transformed into edr2- <dig> and the resulting lines were analyzed for complementation of the mutant phenotype and gfp fluorescence . the construct complemented both the resistance and the lesion phenotype in five independent transgenic lines . using a spinning disk scanning laser confocal microscope, edr2:ha:egfp was observed in the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and in small endosomes in young seedlings . in young dividing cells, the expression of edr <dig> seemed greatly reduced relative to levels observed in more mature cells . in the rosette leaves of mature plants, edr2:ha:egfp was localized to the same three subcellular compartments, although to a lesser relative extent to the endoplasmic reticulum. edr2:ha:egfp did not co-localize with the mitochondrial dye mitotracker .

discussion
the edr <dig> mutants exhibit properties consistent with the assumption that edr <dig> acts as a negative regulator of cell death . the chlorosis and necrosis phenotypes do not develop spontaneously and do not develop in response to various abiotic stresses, such as wounding, heat stress, light stress, or drought stress. the chlorosis and necrosis were elicited only following inoculation with the pathogens g. cichoracearum, b. g. hordei or h. parasitica . these results confirm that edr <dig> plays a role specifically in the cell death associated with plant-pathogen interactions and does not have a general role in cell death. these features distinguish the edr <dig> mutants from typical lesion mimic mutants such as the acd and lsd classes. in addition, the occurrence of chlorotic and necrotic tissue was restricted to inoculation sites and did not spread suggesting that edr <dig> restricts the initiation of cell death rather than its spread .

because both g. cichoracearum and h. parasitica are biotrophic pathogens, the chlorosis and necrosis that develop may be sufficient to account for the restricted growth of these pathogens in the edr <dig> mutants. however, the sa pathway, but not the ethylene/jasmonate pathway, appears to be somewhat deregulated in that pr <dig> transcript levels are elevated in edr <dig> mutants relative to wild type following elicitation by bth or pathogen attack . furthermore, plants deficient in sa accumulation or signaling suppress both the development of chlorosis and necrosis as well as the disease resistance phenotypes of edr <dig> mutants . thus, it is also possible that sa-dependent defenses unrelated to cell death contribute to the disease resistance phenotype of edr <dig> mutants.

the sa signal transduction pathway is required for the hr elicited by incompatible plant-pathogen interactions. however, cell death is known to activate the sa signal transduction pathway in adjacent living tissue in a positive feedback loop that amplifies signal transduction via this defense pathway  <cit> . thus, it is difficult to know whether edr <dig> acts upstream of sa to limit sa activation of cell death or downstream of sa. pad <dig> and eds <dig> have homology to lipases and have been shown to be required for the accumulation of sa  <cit> . given that edr <dig> may bind lipid-like molecules via both its ph and start domains, edr <dig> may have a direct or indirect inhibitory effect on pad <dig> or eds <dig> via a lipid-like intermediate. candidates for this lipid-like intermediate could be a sphingolipid  <cit> , phosphatidic acid  <cit>  or oleic acid  <cit> .

edr <dig> encodes a novel protein with three predicted domains, a ph, a start and a duf <dig> domain. three other predicted proteins with this domain structure occur in the arabidopsis genome and three in the rice genome , but none have been assigned a function to date  <cit> . the duf <dig> domain appears to be plant-specific but  <dig> animal proteins contain ph and start domains including the human cert , a splice variant of the goodpasture antigen binding protein  <cit> . in the cert protein, the ph domain binds pi-4-p as does the edr <dig> ph domain  <cit> . in addition, the start domain of the cert protein binds to ceramides. from these properties, hanada et al.  suggested that this protein acts to carry ceramides via a non-vesicle mediated transport mechanism from their site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi where they are converted to syphingomyelin  <cit> .

plants also synthesize ceramide and more complex sphingolipids, some of which have been localized to detergent-resistant membrane domains  <cit> . alterations in ceramides and/or sphingolipids or possibly the accumulation of their precursors stimulate cell death in plants and animals. the mechanism by which sphingolipids promote cell death is unknown and may be indirect via their impact on the functioning of cell death effectors found in lipid rafts such as ion channels  <cit> . it is tempting then to speculate that edr <dig>  like cert, carries ceramides from the endoplasmic reticulum to another subcellular membrane, such as the plasma membrane or endosomes. both membranes are labeled by edr2:ha:gfp . presumably, the vesicle-mediated movement of ceramides among plant compartments is sufficient to support normal growth and development. if responses to pathogen attack demand additional ceramides or sphingolipids in a specific membrane, then non-vesicle-mediated transport via edr <dig> may be required to supplement vesicle-mediated transport. this might explain why edr <dig> mutants do not constitutively exhibit lesions, as do acd <dig> and acd <dig>  it is also possible that at5g <dig>  the closely related gene, is partially redundant to edr <dig> but unable to meet extra demand in plants under pathogen attack.

alternate models are possible. the function of ph domains is not clear, but it is generally believed that they provide a way to selectively direct proteins to membranes  <cit> . however, the ph-domain can bind ligands other than phosphatidylinositols. for example, the ph-domains of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase and phospholipase c β bind to both a lipid and the gβ,γ subunit of trimeric g-proteins  <cit> . furthermore, it is conceivable that the ph-domain may interact co-operatively with the start-domain and that the concerted action of both domains influences the ligands bound to edr <dig> and consequently edr <dig> function, as has been observed with the insulin receptor substrate  <dig>  <cit> . it is equally possible that the duf <dig> domain plays a novel role in restricting cell death  <cit>  and the ph and start domains serve to localize the edr <dig> protein to the correct membrane following pathogen attack or during senescence. determining the lipid or sterol molecule bound by the start domain would be an important step in unraveling the role of edr <dig> in restricting cell death in plant-pathogen interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
edr <dig> was isolated as a negative regulator of cell death, specifically the cell death elicited by pathogen attack but not by abiotic stresses. edr <dig> encodes a novel protein with ph, start and duf <dig> domains. the ph domain of edr <dig> binds preferentially to pi-4-p and the edr <dig> protein localizes to endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. the lesions that develop in edr <dig> mutants are dependent on the sa signal transduction pathway providing an additional link to defense responses. thus, it is possible that edr <dig> or possibly a lipid/sterol product acts in opposition to the sa pathway to fine tune the hr.
