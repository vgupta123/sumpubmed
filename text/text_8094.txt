BACKGROUND
coix lacryma-jobi l. , also commonly called adlay , is widely cultivated as a food and medicine plant in east and southeast asian countries <cit> . its grain has the highest protein content among cereal crops <cit> , and its seed extracts are used to treat several diseases <cit> . previous research on coix has focused mainly on its medicinal components and their efficacy <cit> . genetic and genomic studies on coix are sparse, although there are some reports on cytogenetic analysis, genetic linkage map development <cit> , construction of bac libraries <cit> , and isolation of prolamin gene families <cit> .

the genus coix belongs to maydeae of poaceae family and is the closest group to the genera zea, tripsacum, and sorghum <cit> . the places of the origin of the three genera are very different. zea originates from america, and sorghum originates from africa, while the genus coix is indigenous to southeast asia <cit> . previous studies have shown that coix comprises of 9– <dig> species with different levels of ploidy. tetraploids  predominate, including the exclusively cultivated coix lacryma-jobi l., while diploids , hexaploids , and octoploids  with a basic chromosome number of x =  <dig> are less frequent <cit> . coix aquatica roxb. has been reported to have three fertile cytotypes . a sterile cytotype  of very close botanical relationship to c. aquatica was found in southwest china <cit> . the results from genomic in situ hybridization  demonstrated that  <dig> out of its  <dig> chromosomes are highly homologous to the chromosomes of c. lacryma-jobi <cit> . the genomic and evolutionary information of c. lacryma-jobi and this sterile c. aquatica remains elusive. furthermore, the phylogenetic relationship between coix and zea/sorghum is still unclear. comparative analysis of genomic dna sequences may contribute to answer those questions.

the majority of the genomic sequences in higher eukaryotes are repetitive elements including transposable elements and satellite repeats <cit> . large-scale accumulation of satellites and transposable elements serves as a major driving force for genome expansion <cit> . most long terminal repeat  retrotransposable elements disperse throughout plant chromosomes, while some elements locate in specific regions of chromosomes <cit> . satellite dna sequences, consisting of short tandem repeats, share a common structural feature <cit> . they are usually located in specific chromosomal regions and may be broadly classified as centromeric, subtelomeric, or intercalary repetitive sequences <cit> . satellite repeats are very powerful tools for chromosome identification, chromosome karyotyping, and comparative genome analysis <cit> . because of similar chromosome lengths and/or arm ratios and lack of sufficient landmarks, adequate identification of coix chromosome pairs remains challenging. therefore, identification and characterization of major repetitive sequences are essential for understanding the organization and structure of coix genomes.

in this study, we sequenced ~ <dig> gb genomic sequences of c. lacryma-jobi and  <dig> gb genomic sequences of c. aquatica hg, and found highly dynamic nature of these two genomes during evolution. our karyotyping analysis revealed that c. lacryma-jobi is a diploidized paleotetraploid species, and c. aquatica hg is recently formed hybrid between c. lacryma-jobi and a distantly related species. comparative repeat sequence analysis supported that coix is closer to sorghum than to zea. the findings in this study advance our understanding of coix genome evolution and shed new light on the genomics of the poaceae family.

RESULTS
low-coverage sequencing of c. lacryma-jobiand c. aquaticahg genomes and repetitive sequence analysis
to better understand the coix genus at the genome level, we determined the genome size of the two coix species using flow cytometry with the maize inbred line b <dig>  as a reference genome . the genome size of c. lacryma-jobi was approximately  <dig>  mb , similar to the previous report <cit> . c. aquatica hg had a genome of approximately  <dig>  mb , about  <dig> -fold of the c. lacryma-jobi genome.table  <dig>

we found that retroelements occupied  <dig> % of the c. lacryma-jobi genome and  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome . the two dominant families of retroelements are ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy retrotransposons. the ty1/copia occupied  <dig> % of the c. lacryma-jobi genome and  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome, while the ty3/gypsy occupied  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the most abundant type i transposon was the spm class of transposons, and the mutator was also enriched in coix.

we believed that the abundance of many repeats varied greatly between these two species. to test this hypothesis, we conducted a comparative analysis by combining reads of these two species and performing cluster-based repeat identification and classification on the combined reads <cit> . in spite of lacking statistical examination on these data, we found that cl <dig>  a ty1/copia member, occupied  <dig> % of the c. lacryma-jobi genome but only  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome, and other ty1/copia elements including cl <dig>  cl <dig>  cl <dig>  cl <dig>  and cl <dig> all displayed a similar pattern . together, ty1/copia retroelements have a higher percentage in c. lacryma-jobi than in c. aquatica hg. similarly, some clusters of ty3/gypsy also showed genome proportion change, for example, cl <dig> and cl <dig> occupies  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the c. lacryma-jobi genome respectively, while  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome respectively. to further verify these results, we conducted fish on the chromosomes of the two species using cl <dig> and cl <dig> as probes . cl <dig> probe exhibited intense signal in both species. in c. aquatica hg,  <dig> out of  <dig> chromosomes showed stronger signals than the other  <dig> chromosomes. cl <dig> probe only showed faint signal in c. lacryma-jobi, while intense signal was observed on c. aquatica hg chromosomes. similar to the signal of cl <dig> probe,  <dig> out of the  <dig> chromosomes in c. aquatica hg showed stronger signal of cl <dig> probe than the other  <dig> chromosomes. the distribution and proportion of ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy family members were illustrated in figure  <dig>  our sequencing results revealed that four families  were present only in one species but absent in the other species. we further confirmed the results of cl <dig> and cl <dig> by fish . this varied abundance of the ltr retroelements in the two species may result from sweep or accumulation of the same families, or the rapid change during polyploidization <cit> .figure  <dig>

our results showed that the satellite dna made up only  <dig> % of the c. lacryma-jobi genome in contrast to  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome. we also found that the most abundant repeats in these two species were completely different, and the proportion of the co-existing satellite repeats varied greatly in these two genomes , indicating rapid evolution of satellite repeats in coix. in particular, two distinct satellite repeats  made up approximately  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome . the rdna proportion was similar in the two genomes. the information of other repeat families was presented in the additional file <dig> table  <dig>

a novel centromeric satellite repeat was identified in c. aquaticahg
it has been demonstrated that ten chromosomes in c. aquatica hg with less homology to c. lacryma-jobi harbor low copy number of centromeric repeat centx and a large amount of centromeric retrotransposon crc <cit> . to identify possible new centromeric repeats in these ten chromosomes, we used an oscenh <dig> antibody specific for the  <dig> centromeres in c. aquatica hg to perform chip-seq assay . quantitative chip pcr showed significant relative enrichment of centx and crc in the chiped dna , suggesting that centx and crc might be associated with cenh <dig>  the functional centromere marker. in the absence of a reference genome, we mapped chip-seq data to the clusters of the c. aquatica hg genome for cluster-based repeat identification. the result also showed the significant relative enrichment of centx and crc. besides, we identified a novel centx variant in c. aquatica hg. in contrast to the typical size of 153 bp for centx, the monomer of this centx variant had 102 bp and accounted for  <dig> % of the total centx in the chiped dna. according to our whole genome sequencing data, this variant made up  <dig> % of the total centx and  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome. to test whether this variant is specifically located on the  <dig> chromosomes less homologous to the c. lacryma-jobi chromosomes, we conducted fish using the sequence of the 102 bp centx variant and the sequence of the 51 bp missing from the centx variant but in the typical centx as separate probes . both of the 102 bp variant and the 51 bp fragment did not show a different distribution pattern compared with the typical centx. the extremely faint signals from the two probes showed a similar intensity on the  <dig> chromosomes less homologous to c. lacryma-jobi chromosomes. these results indicate that the 102 bp variant may not be specific to the  <dig> chromosomes.figure  <dig>

the karyotype of c. lacryma-jobiand c. aquaticahg
we performed karyotyping analysis on c. lacryma-jobi and c. aquatica hg using the satellite repeats, 5s rdna and 45s rdna as probes . the signal of the centromeric satellite repeat centx was large on the chromosomes pair  <dig>  strong on the chromosomes pairs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  weak on the chromosomes pairs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and faint on the chromosomes pair  <dig>  the 45s rdna probe appeared as one large signal at the end of the short arm of the chromosome pair  <dig>  the signal from the 5s rdna was located at the peri-centromeric region of the long arm of the chromosome pair  <dig>  it is generally agreed that, sats <dig>  sats <dig>  and sats <dig> signals sequentially approach the telomere at the subtelomeric region. thus, using these five repeat probes, we expected to identify the individual somatic chromosome in c. lacryma-jobi. the signal patterns on c. lacryma-jobi chromosomes were shown in figure 4e. we prepared an ideogram displaying the position and fluorescence intensity of satellite repeats on c. lacryma-jobi chromosomes . the relative length of each chromosome pair was listed in additional file1: table s <dig> figure  <dig>

we used a similar approach to determine the karyotype of c. aquatica hg . by using the centx and c. lacryma-jobi genomic dna probes, we found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> chromosomes of c. aquatica hg were highly homologous to the chromosomes of c. lacryma-jobi. we then further karyotyped these  <dig> chromosomes by sequential fish using the following three probe cocktails: 1) 45s rdna and 5s rdna; 2) co-existing satellites sats <dig>  sats <dig> and sats5; 3) sats <dig> and sats <dig>  signals from the co-existing satellite probe cocktail showed not only different distribution patterns in c. aquatica hg compared with c. lacryma-jobi, but also a pronounced asymmetric distribution on each chromosome pair . we confirmed this observation by fish on pachytene chromosomes . under the condition of enhanced visualization of chromosome pairing, sats <dig> and sats <dig> signals on the homologous chromosome pairs appeared as a pattern of contrasting presence on one chromosome and absence on the paired one, or large amount on one chromosome and small amount on the paired one .figure  <dig>

next, we numbered the remaining  <dig> chromosomes as a <dig> to a <dig> and stained them with the probe cocktails. the signal distribution patterns of the probes on a1-a <dig> chromosomes were quite different from the patterns on the other  <dig> chromosomes. a faint 5s rdna signal appeared near the end of the long arm of chr. a <dig>  sats <dig> was absent on chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig>  and 45s rdna signal was absent on all the  <dig> chromosomes, indicating a different origin of this set of chromosomes compared with the other  <dig> chromosomes. we made a putative ideograph displaying the position and fluorescence intensity of satellites on c. aquatica hg chromosomes . the relative length of chromosome pairs was listed in additional file1: table s <dig> figure  <dig>

determination of the ploidy level of c. lacryma-jobiand c. aquaticahg
because certain coix species have ten chromosomes <cit> , it is possible that c. lacryma-jobi is a tetraploid and c. aquatica hg is a hexaploid. according to previous reports, c. aquatica should be fertile and able to propagate by fertilization <cit> . however, our karyotyping analysis revealed  <dig> chromosome pairs in c. lacryma-jobi and  <dig> paired plus  <dig> unpaired chromosomes in c. aquatica hg, implying the absence of any typical characteristics of a tetraploid or hexaploid genome . we then determined chromosome pairing during metaphase i in c. lacryma-jobi and c. aquatica hg using centx and crc probes. consistent with the previous report <cit> , our cytogenetic analysis showed that all the examined c. lacryma-jobi meiotic cells had  <dig> bivalents, while except one cell with an ambiguous trivalent, the rest of the examined c. aquatica hg meiotic cells had  <dig> bivalents and  <dig> univalents . we also analyzed pollen viability of the c. aquatica hg using i2-ki dying method, and found that the pollen grains were sterile . thus, based on the fact that c. aquatica hg is reproduced by vegetative propagation <cit>  and our findings, we believed that the c. aquatica hg might be recently formed hybrid and c. lacryma-jobi is a diploidized paleotetraploid species.table  <dig>

comparative analysis on the repeat sequence in coix, zeaand sorghum
we performed classification analysis of ltr for the c. lacryma-jobi and c. aquatica hg using plant ty1/copia clades including tos <dig>  sire1/maximus, tnt <dig>  angela, tont <dig>  reina and bianca <cit> . as illustrated in figure 8a, coix ty1/copia elements were distributed in six clades except the tos <dig> clade. the most abundant retroelements in coix is the sire1/maximus family members, which is also abundant in maize genome <cit> . our results show that all abundant ty1/copia families in sorghum and zea were also present in coix, indicating a close relationship of these three genera.figure  <dig>

additionally, we analyzed seven well characterized ty3/gypsy clades including crm, hopscotch, tekay, galadriel, athila, ogre and tat <cit> . we found tekay, crm, reina, athila, and tat in coix . huck in tekay has been shown to be one of the four most dominant retroelements in zea mays, and a moderate-repetitive dna in sorghum bicolor <cit> . leviathan in tat was found to be abundant in sorghum bicolor, and moderately abundant in zea mays with no recent activities <cit> . we found that huck shared one node with coix_cl <dig>  and caqu_cl <dig> , and leviathan also shared one node with coix_cl <dig>  and caqu_cl <dig> , indicating that the divergence of coix and sorghum might be later than that of sorghum and zea.

we downloaded paired-end sequences of zea mays , zea luxurians, and sorghum bicolor  fromhttp://sra.dnanexus.com/, and combined all the sequences. we found that repetitive sequences account for 79% of the maize genome and  <dig> % of the sorghum genome which is very similar to the previous reports <cit> . distribution of major repeat families in the five species showed that the species-specific clusters occupied  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome and  <dig> % of the sorghum genome, but were not detected in the other three species . the co-existing clusters made up  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome,  <dig> % of the coix lacryma-jobi genome,  <dig> % of the zea mays genome,  <dig> % in the zea luxurians genome, and  <dig> % of the sorghum bicolor genome. coix-sorghum co-existing clusters accounted for  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome,  <dig> % of the coix lacryma-jobi genome, and  <dig> % of the sorghum bicolor genome. only a few co-existing clusters were found in zea and sorghum. c. lacryma-jobi and zea shared  <dig> clusters, however, these clusters only made up  <dig> % of the c. lacryma-jobi genome. thus, c. lacryma-jobi and c. aquatica hg shared more co-existing repeat families with sorghum than with zea. to confirm that coix shared more repeat sequences with sorghum than with zea, we analyzed repeat sequences in c. lacryma-jobi, c. aquatica hg, maize, and sorghum using the repeatmasker program  and found that repeat sequences in coix were more similar to those in sorghum than to those in maize . therefore, our results corroborate the previous phylogenetic speculation, which shows that coix might be closer to sorghum than to zea <cit> .figure  <dig>

discussion
the dynamic nature of the repetitive sequences in coix
repetitive sequences play essential roles in genome structuring and evolution, and they usually expand disproportionally to genome enlargement <cit> . in the grass family, repetitive dna accounts for 40% of 466 mb rice genome <cit> , 62% of 740 mb sorghum genome <cit> , and 82% of 2300 mb maize genome <cit> . in general, the larger a genome size is, the larger is the portion of repeats in the genome. in this study, flow cytometry analysis showed that the genome size of c. lacryma-jobi and c. aquatica hg, were approximately 1665 mb and 2335 mb, respectively . by using "cluster-based repeat identification" approach, we reanalyzed the repetitive dna proportion in zea mays and sorghum bicolor genome as 79% and  <dig> %, respectively, which is consistent with the previous reports <cit> . we found that coix had a quite high percentage of repetitive dna:  <dig> % for c. lacryma-jobi and  <dig> % for c. aquatica hg . notably, our results showed that c. aquatica hg with a larger genome than c. lacryma-jobi harbored less abundant repetitive dna compared with c. lacryma-jobi. one possibility might be that c. aquatica hg may arise from the hybridization of c. lacryma-jobi with another relative with less repetitive dna, indicating a more recent origin of this species. the genome size of c. aquatica hg is  <dig> -fold of the c. lacryma-jobi genome . we suspected that the c. aquatica hg genome might be still in the process of expanding after original genome fusion. the loss of two tandem repeats  and the lower percentage of the co-existing satellites in c. lacryma-jobi suggested rapid evolution of this genome . the second interpretation might be that the absence of chromosome recombination and rearrangement during meiosis decelerate genome reshuffling in the sterile c. aquatica hg. thirdly, the extent and speed of transposable element expansion may somehow vary in these two species, resulting in the compositional differences of repetitive sequences in the two species <cit> .

transposable elements are a major class of repetitive dna driving genome expansion and speciation <cit> . many families or genera have specific types of transposable elements interspersed in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions <cit> . c. lacryma-jobi and c. aquatica hg consist of typical repetitive dna in poaceae family <cit> . in this study, the most abundant repetitive elements were ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy, comprising  <dig> % of the c. lacryma-jobi genome and  <dig> % of the c. aquatica hg genome . similar to differential enrichment of ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy retroelements in musa acuminate genome <cit> , we found the proportion of ty1/copia was moderately higher than that of ty3/gypsy in c. lacryma-jobi . however, ty3/gypsy retroelements were more abundant than ty1/copia retroelements in c. aquatica hg in our study, which is similar to zea and sorghum, oryza sativa, spirodela polyrhiza, brachypodium distachyon, and arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . inspection of ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy content of plant genomes in a phylogenetic context reveals no congruence in their content even in closely related species and highlights differences in success of genome occupation <cit> . this obvious difference between these two species may be caused by differential amplification or removal of ty1/copia and ty3/gypsy elements in c. lacryma-jobi and c. aquatica hg.

satellite repeats are also a critical class of repetitive dna in higher eukaryotes <cit> . long stretches of satellite repeats may reside in a special chromosomal locus as a hallmark, functional unit, or a driving force for genome revolution <cit> . the centromere specific satellite repeats are particularly important for centromere formation, expansion, and function. consistent with their functional conservation, centromeric satellite repeats are broadly conserved in length, in spite of large variation in their dna sequences <cit> . the size of individual centromeric satellite repeat is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 171 bp in maize, rice, brassica, and human, respectively. very interestingly, we found  <dig> and 102 bp centromeric satellite repeats in coix. the 153 bp satellite repeat is within the normal range of the length of centromeric satellite repeats, while the 102 bp repeat is the shortest centromeric satellite repeat reported in poaceae thus far. similarly, different satellite repeats are also detected in potato <cit> . in-depth comparative sequence analysis of five homologous centromeres in two solanum species indicates that centromeric satellite repeats may undergo boom-bust cycles before a favorable repeat is fixed in a population <cit> . this may explain why the 153 bp and 102 bp repeats co-exist in the coix centromere. megabase-sized centromeric satellite repeats in large genomes may trace back to ltr retrotransposon <cit> , although neocentromeres may function properly without satellite repeats during early stages of centromere evolution <cit> . given that c. aquatica hg is sterile and spreads by vegetative propagation, we believe that the evolution of its centromere may be reproductively suppressed. therefore, the 102 bp variant may represent an evolutionary intermediate of centromeric repeat in coix.

ploidy level of c. lacryma-jobiand c. aquaticahg
c. lacryma-jobi  and c. aquatica hg  are generally known as tetraploid and hexaploid species, respectively, because the diploid species within the coix genus has been reported to contain  <dig> chromosomes in its somatic cells <cit> .the genus sorghum has  <dig> species with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> chromosomes, and these species are classified as diploid plants <cit> . ploidy level of c. lacryma-jobi and c. aquatica hg remains inconclusive. karyotyping analysis has been shown to be able to provide direct evidence for homologous chromosome identification in polyploid species by visualizing characteristic chromosomal structures <cit> . taking advantage of a set of powerful satellite repeat markers, we found clear sats <dig>  sats <dig> and sats <dig> signal pairs on metaphase chromosomes in the c. lacryma-jobi karyotype, which represent the typical feature of diploid karyotypes. furthermore, we found that  <dig> chromosomes displayed  <dig> perfect pairs in pachytene, which was consistent with the  <dig> bivalents during the meiosis i. therefore, we speculated that c. lacryma-jobi might behave as a diploid species. however, our observation could not rule out the possibility that c. lacryma-jobi might be an ancient tetraploid species. during the evolution of many ancient tetraploid species, diploidization often occurs to restructure the genome <cit> . thus, we suspected that the c. lacryma-jobi genome, as a tetraploid during its early evolution, might go through subsequent diploidization, similar to what has happened to maize.

in c. aquatica hg, gish with c. lacryma-jobi genomic dna has been shown to identify  <dig> homologous chromosomes <cit> . in this study, the  <dig> chromosomes also had bright centromeric satellite  signals . additionally, some chromosome pairs, such as chromosome  <dig> and 1’, and chromosomes  <dig> and 4’, showed asymmetric repeat signals of sats <dig>  sats <dig>  sats <dig>  sats <dig> and sats <dig> , suggesting that the  <dig> paired chromosomes may be derived from a recent hybridization of two dissimilar parents and that repeat sequence homogenization may be still an ongoing process <cit> . we also found that the other  <dig> chromosomes have extremely faint signals of centromeric satellite repeats  compared with the  <dig> paired chromosomes, and the signal patterns of other satellites on these  <dig> chromosomes were also different from those on the  <dig> paired chromosomes in c. aquatica hg or in the c. lacryma-jobi chromosomes . we found that during meiosis i,  <dig> chromosomes of c. aquatica hg formed ten bivalents and ten univalents . in addition, pollen of c. aquatica hg was almost completely sterile . all these data suggested that the c. aquatica hg could be a recently formed hybrid between an octoploid cytotype  related to c. lacryma-jobi and a tetraploid cytotype  of a more distantly related coix species . another possibility is that the hybrid plant might be formed by a diploid  and a different diploid  parent, consequently resulting in a numerically unreduced gamete, hence mimicking a partial autopolyploidization of the second nonhomologous genome.

the phylogenetic relationship of zea, sorghumand coixwas corroborated by comparative repeat sequence analysis
zea, sorghum, and coix are close relatives in poaceae family, although they independently originated in central america, africa, and southeast asia, respectively <cit> . previous studies using chloroplast sequences indicate that coix is evolutionarily closer to sorghum than to zea <cit> , which has been further confirmed by comparative analysis of the bz orthologous region <cit> . this argument, however, is still questionable due to the absence of evidence from nuclear genome. in our study, we compared all repeat elements of five species from zea, sorghum, and coix. we found that the co-existing repeat families in zea and coix comprised only  <dig> clusters. however, the sorghum and coix shared  <dig> clusters. zea and sorghum only had  <dig> cluster in common . these lines of evidence from nuclear dna sequences also support a close evolutionary relationship between coix and sorghum and a relative distant evolutionary relationship between zea and sorghum.

we also identified the most abundant families of ltr-retrotransposon of zea and sorghum in the coix genome, indicating that coix, zea and sorghum may be closely related to one another. it has been shown that ji and opie are the most abundant ty1/copia-type retroelements in zea mays, and their copies decrease in sorghum bicolor and coix <cit> . huck is an abundant ty3/gypsy type retroelement in zea mays <cit> , but just a moderately repetitive element in sorghum bicolor and coix <cit> . additionally, leviathan is moderately abundant in coix and sorghum bicolor genomes <cit> . these results, together with those from repeat sequence comparison, suggest that the dynamics of the genome-wide repeat elements in coix, zea and sorghum, to certain extent, might facilitate the clarification of the evolution relationship of these close species.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used low-coverage sequencing on coix lacryma-jobi l.  and coix aquatica roxb. hg  to analyze repeat elements. we revealed the genome structure of these two species and large proportional difference of the same repetitive element between two genomes, indicating evolutionary divergence of these two species. the fine karyotyping analysis using satellites as markers and the chromosome pairing of meiotic metaphase i of these two species suggests that c. lacryma-jobi is likely a diploidized paleotetraploid species, and c. aquatica hg might be an early generation hybrid between coix lacryma-jobi l. and a distantly related species. in addition, the genome-wide repeat sequence comparative analysis of zea mays, zea luxurians, sorghum bicolor, and coix indicated that coix seem to be closer to sorghum than to zea, which is consistent to previous report. our results shed new light on the evolution and species differentiation in the poaceae family.
