BACKGROUND

scn9a gene encodes the alpha-subunit of voltage-gated sodium channel nav <dig>  that is expressed in dorsal root ganglion  nociceptors and in sympathetic neurons. nav <dig>  is folded into four homologous domains, each containing six transmembrane helices . s1–s <dig> helices form the voltage-sensing domain  and highly conserved basic residues in s <dig> sense the electric field across the membrane. s5–s <dig> helices with the re-entrant extracellular loop in between form the pore domain   <cit> . membrane depolarisation induces a conformational change in the vsd that, through the s4-s <dig> linker, is transmitted to the pd and prompt the gate to open, allowing the passage of sodium ions through the pore  <cit> . opening and closing of the channel modulate the subthreshold membrane potential of nociceptors and play a key role in regulating their firing.

missense mutations in scn9a have been associated to a spectrum of painful conditions in humans  <cit> , including inherited erythromelalgia , , paroxysmal extreme pain disorder  , and small fibre neuropathy   <cit> . voltage-clamp recording, performed in transfected cell lines and drg neurons in vitro, showed that iem-related mutations enhance the activation of nav <dig>  through a hyperpolarising shift and a slower deactivation that keeps the channel open longer once it is activated  <cit> , thus generating a larger-than-normal inward sodium current, with greater biophysical changes at higher temperature  <cit> . pepd-related nav <dig>  mutations impair channel inactivation and prolong action potentials and repetitive nociceptor firing in response to provoking stimuli, such as stretching and exposure to cold temperatures  <cit> . nav <dig>  mutations identified in sfn patients display a spectrum of electrophysiological signatures, including impaired slow inactivation, depolarised slow and fast inactivation and enhanced resurgent currents  <cit> .

overall, all the disease-related nav <dig>  mutations are pro-excitatory for the nav <dig>  channel, thus increasing nociceptor excitability. for those nav <dig>  mutations that have been studied by structural modelling, the gain-of-function effect stems from functionally significant changes in the biomolecular structure of nav <dig>  channel . accordingly, gain-of-function mutations found in iem, pepd, and sfn patients might be expected to produce functionally significant changes in the protein structure of nav <dig> , whereas single nucleotide polymorphisms  or variants not associated with disease would not be expected to modify the nav <dig>  protein structure in functionally significant ways. previous nav <dig>  structural modelling, combined with functional studies, showed that the disruption of the hydrophobic ring by the f1449v  <cit>  or the in-frame deletion leu955del  <cit>  contribute to destabilizing the nav <dig>  closed-state. these studies suggest that homology modelling is a useful tool to predict functional changes in the biomolecular structure of nav <dig> . however, the nature and extent of interatomic bond variations in nav <dig>  protein structure caused by amino acid changes have not been examined over a spectrum of mutations and snps.

structural modelling combined with network theory has been widely exploited in studying protein structure to identify the emergent features of global connectivity. indeed, several studies have used network theory to provide important insights in the local topology of interactions from a global prospective with examples from the field of allosteric communication pathways  <cit> , protein-protein interactions  <cit> , catalytic site residues in enzymes  <cit>  and protein-folding mechanisms  <cit> . several methods have been proposed in the literature to transform the protein structures into a network by considering:  the c-alpha/c-beta atoms in the amino acid residues, as in a protein backbone network  <cit>   description of the atomic contacts between residues that also feature correlated motions  or  weak and strong non-covalent protein structure network considering atom-atom interaction at the side chain level which has been proven to provide valuable biological insights  <cit> . these studies have shown that network analysis of a protein can yield a useful method to characterize the topology of the constituent amino acid residues. protein topologies and interaction connectivity could often produce distinct small-world networks proprieties  <cit> , thus having high local connectivity of residue nodes with a smaller number of long-range residue-residue interactions.

in the present study, we aimed at elucidating specific interatomic bond variations caused by amino acid changes in nav <dig>  structure by using a network-based method. we tested the hypothesis that mutations associated with iem, pepd and sfn cause specific types of interatomic bonds variation of nav <dig>  that can be quantified by a network-based theoretical approach able to reduce the complexity of the three-dimensional protein architecture to one-dimensional graphs  <cit> .

nav <dig>  homology modelling
a homology model of the closed-state pore domain of the nav <dig>  was generated using the crystal structure of the bacterial arcobacter bultzeri nav channel navab  <cit>  as a template with the human sequence nm_ <dig>  through the memoir server  <cit> . gap region  between template-target alignment and interdomain loop regions  were excluded from in-silico mutagenesis . the navab template shared 28% sequence identity for di, 24% for dii, 28% for diii and 28% for div . the four homologous domains were modelled in the clockwise direction viewed from the extracellular side as previously suggested  <cit> . ab-initio modelling was performed to extend the s <dig> helices of the pd using the iterative threading assembly refinement  server  <cit> . the final model was subjected to energy minimization and model refinement using the yamber force field  <cit>  and the fragment-guided molecular dynamics  server  <cit> . the nav <dig>  wt model was subjected to stereochemical analysis with rampage server . rampage provides results in a graphical form that shows the number of residues falling in favoured region, allowed region and in outlier region.

in-silico mutagenesis of nav <dig>  pathogenetic and control mutations
we performed in-silico mutagenesis via wt domain replacement of nav <dig>  mutations found in iem, pepd or sfn patients in which gain-of-function was demonstrated by cell electrophysiology assay and that do not alter the biophysical properties of the channel . to increase the number of control variants, we added missense snps identified between scn9a homologous genes sharing >90% nucleotide sequence identity using the ncbi homologene database  <cit> . we constructed the phylogenetic tree of the multiple sequence alignment using clustalw via neighbor joining method . the mutated models were further subjected to energy minimization and model refinement using the yamber force field  <cit>  and the fg-md server   <cit> . such hsnps have previously been used in similar studies . all the mutations and snps are reported in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

transforming nav <dig>  structure into residue interaction graphs
nav <dig>  structures were transformed into mathematical graphs by identifying interatomic bonds between the amino acids. the amino acid residues form the nodes and inter-node contact interaction form the edges of the graph . we identified the interatomic bonds  between two residues i and j as long as the atom-atom distance between them was less than  <dig>  Å using the commands “listintatom” and “listintbo” via yasara software . hydrophobic contacts between residues were considered in the following atom groups:  the first carbon of ch3-, -ch2- and chc <dig>  sp <dig> carbons . π-π stacking were considered between  sp <dig> carbons with a hydrogen and  carbon, nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur atoms in planar phenolic rings. cation-π formation was considered to be a π-π contact with the difference being that one of the interaction partners is a cation. the de novo network construction for each mutant and wt models is achieved considering the predicted binary interatomic bonds identified through yasara software.

topological metrics and network visualization
we computed some of the most well-known network centrality measures for each mutant and wt network nav <dig>  graph using the cytoscape plugin networkanalyzer  <cit> , namely:

betweenness centrality  and edge betweenness centrality : bct  <cit>  is defined as the fraction of shortest pathways between all pairs of nodes of the network that go through that node. let g =  a graph, where n is the set of the nodes and e is the set of the edges. for each node n and m in n, let d  the distance between n and m. we define  <dig> betweennesscentralityn=∑s≠n≠tσstnσst, where s, t ∈n, σst  is the number of shortest paths from s to t that n lies on, and σst denotes the number of shortest paths from s to t. it accounts the importance of a node facilitating interactions between other nodes. for example, a node with high bct can operate as a bridge on many shortest paths between other nodes in the network. it is a measure of how powerful a node is able to transfer  or interrupt  the spread of information on the fastest connection between two nodes. similarly, the ebct of an edge is the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes that run along it. we define:  <dig> edgebetweennesse=∑ni∈n∑nj∈n\ni∑σninjeσninj, 


where n = set of nodes; e = set of edges; σninj = number of shortest paths between ni and nj; σninje = number of shortest paths between ni and nj which pass through e ∊ e;

degree : d  <cit>  of a node  is defined as the total number of nodes that it is directly connected to;

clustering coefficient : clustering coefficient  <cit>  is a metric commonly employed to identify well-connected sub-components in network which represents the interconnectivity of neighbors of the node. it measures the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together and is defined as the fraction of triangles around a node among the total number of possible triangles. we define  <dig> clusteringcoefficientn=2enknkn− <dig>  where kn is the number of neighbors of n and en is the number of connected pairs between all neighbors of n;

closeness centrality : cct is defined as the sum of the inverted distances, i.e. farness, to all other nodes in the graph. it captures the basic intuition that the closer a node is to all other nodes in terms of path length, the more important it is. mathematically, cct of a node n is defined as the inverse of the sum of shortest paths from n to all other nodes m in network. we define  <dig> closenessn=1averagedn,m 


eccentricity : ect measures the distance between a node n and the most distance node m; if the ect of the node n is low, this means that all other nodes are in proximity whereas a high ect means that there is at least one node  that is far from node n. we define ect maximum non-infinite length of a shortest path between n and another node in the network. we define  <dig> eccentricityn=maxdn,m:m∈n 


network centrality measure variation
for each network centrality measures we calculated the difference between mutant and wt values defined as Δvalue . the nav <dig>  amino acid network was visualized using cytoscape’s organic layout, which is a force-directed layout algorithm similar to the fruchterman-reingold approach  <cit> .

statistical analysis
statistical analyses were performed using the r statistical package  <cit> . data are indicated as mean ± sd. statistical significance was determined by the wilcoxon signed-ranked test . the receiver operating characteristics  curve was used to assess the discriminatory power of centrality measure variations between pathogenetic nav <dig>  mutations and control groups . the upper-angle of roc corresponding to the best sensitivity and specificity was used to identify the best cut-off value.

RESULTS
nav <dig>  interatomic structure graph design
we performed homology modelling to construct the tertiary structure of the closed-state nav <dig>  sodium channel . we constructed the atomic model of nav <dig>  sodium channel using the memoir server  <cit>  based on the crystal structure of the bacterial arcobacter bultzeri nav channel navab as a template with the human sequence nm_ <dig> . the first four helices s1–s <dig> form the vsd and the last two helices s5–s <dig> form the pd . gap region  between template-target alignment and interdomain loop regions  were excluded from in-silico mutagenesis. the four homologous domains were modelled in the clockwise direction viewed from the extracellular side as suggested previously  <cit> .
ab-initio modelling was performed to extend the s <dig> helices of the pd using the iterative threading assembly refinement  server  <cit> . the final model was subjected to energy minimization and model refinement using the yamber force field  <cit>  and the fragment-guided molecular dynamics  server  <cit>  . the rampage results for the nav <dig>  model showed  <dig> % residues in most favored region , 9%  in allowed region and  <dig> %  in outlier region. a good quality ramachandran plot has over 90% residues in the most favoured regions  <cit>  therefore ramachandran plot of nav. <dig> it is close to a good quality model .fig.  <dig> nav <dig>  structure and inter-atomic network features. a view of the sodium channel α-subunit from the intracellular side of the membrane nav <dig>  is folded into four repeated domains ; helices s1–s <dig> comprise the voltage-sensing domain ; helices s5–s <dig> and their intracellular linker comprise the pore domain . b intramembrane view of the folded model of nav <dig> . c the graph shows the topology of the mutations found in patients with inherited erythromelalgia , paroxysmal extreme pain disorder , small-fibre neuropathy  and the amino acid substitution with no biophysical abnormalities  and homologous snps . nodes represent the residues and edges of the interatomic bonds. red and black edges represent high  or low  edge betweenness centrality  values, respectively. edge thickness are proportional to ebct and reveal that a high number of shortest paths pass through few edges. *this mutation associates with clinical features of iem and sfn. ǂthis mutation causes in vitro biophysics changes and in vivo symptoms common both to iem and pepd. the nav <dig>  amino acid network were visualized using cytoscape’s organic layout, which is a force-directed layout algorithm similar to the fruchterman-reingold approach




we performed in-silico mutagenesis for  <dig> mutations causing iem,  <dig> mutations causing sfn,  <dig> mutations causing pepd ,  <dig> mutations not causing biophysical abnormalities  in the channel  and  <dig> snps identified among human and homologous mammalian  scn9a genes with >90% sequence identity . all the disease-related mutations had previously been characterized by electrophysiological assays, and found to confer gain-of-function changes to the nav <dig>  channel . the wt and mutant nav <dig>  structures were transformed into undirected graphs by the identification of hydrophobic, cation-π and π-π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds  among the amino acids. in the resulting graph, amino acids are the nodes and their interactions are the edges .

analyses of the interatomic variations caused by gain-of-function mutations
previous studies showed that gain-of-function mutations change the biophysical properties of the channel nav <dig>   but the underlying interatomic variations are yet to be investigated. we analyzed the interatomic variations by calculating the network centrality parameters  of wt and mutated residues and the value of the variation  associated with each gain-of-function nav <dig>  mutation, nabn and hsnp. bct is a measure of the centrality of a node n defined as the fraction of shortest pathways between all pairs of nodes  of the network that go through that node n  <cit> . d of a node n is defined as the total number of nodes that it is directly connected to  <cit> . ccct is a metric commonly employed to identify well-connected sub-components in network which represents the interconnectivity of neighbors of a node n  <cit> . cct is defined as the sum of the inverted distances of a node n, i.e. farness, to all other nodes in the graph. it captures the basic intuition that the closer a node is to all other nodes, the more important it is  <cit> . eccentricity  of a node n is the greatest distance from a node n to any other node m  <cit> .

figure 3a-e show the profile of the topological parameters bct, d, ccct, cct, and ect in wt and mutated residues. the graphs show that both gain-of-function mutations and nabn/hsnps modify the d values  and ccct values  in a wide range but without significant differences between the groups . smaller variations were observed in cct values  and ect values  without significant differences between the groups . overall, Δd, Δccct, Δcct, Δect did not differ significantly between gain-of-function mutations and nabn and hsnps.fig.  <dig> topological parameter profiles of nav <dig>  gain-of-function mutations and nabn and hsnps. a the upper panel shows the bct profile of gain-of-function mutation; the lower panel show the bct profile of nabn and hsnps. squares indicates bct values of wt amino acids, circles indicate bct values of mutated amino acids. the graphs highlight that the difference between bct value of mutated amino acids and bct value of wt amino acids is higher in the cohort of gain-of-function  mutations  compared to control  nabn and hsnps . bct values are multipled by  <dig>  b the box plot shows the |Δbct| difference between gain-of-function mutations and the cohort of nabn and hsnp variants . |∆bct| values are multipled by 100; dark horizontal lines and the triangular symbol represent median and mean values respectively, with the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers the 5th and 95th percentiles, and the dots the outliers. c the upper panel shows the degree  profile of gain-of-function mutations; the lower panel show the d profile of nabn and hsnps. squares indicates d values of wt amino acids, circles indicate d values of mutated amino acids. the box plot shows the |Δd| difference between gain-of-function  mutations and the cohort of nabn and hsnp  variants ; dark horizontal lines and the triangular symbol represent median and mean values respectively, with the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers the 5th and 95th percentiles, and the dots the outliers. d the upper panel shows the clustering coefficient  profile of gain-of-function mutations; the lower panel show the cc profile of nabn and hsnps. squares indicates cc values of wt amino acids; circles indicate cc values of mutated amino acids. the box plot shows the |Δccct| difference between gain-of-function  mutations and the cohort of nabn and hsnp  variants ; dark horizontal lines and the triangular symbol represent median and mean values respectively, with the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers the 5th and 95th percentiles, and the dots the outliers. e the upper panel shows the closeness  profile of gain-of-function mutations; the lower panel show the cct profile of nabn and hsnps. squares indicates cct values of wt amino acids, circles indicate cct values of mutated amino acids. the box plot shows the Δcct difference between gain-of-function  mutations and the cohort of nabn and hsnp  variants . cct and ∆cct values are multipled by 100; dark horizontal lines and the triangular symbol represent median and mean values respectively, with the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers the 5th and 95th percentiles, and the dots the outliers. f the upper panel shows the eccentricity  profile of gain-of-function mutations; the lower panel show the ect profile of nabn and hsnps. squares indicates ect values of wt amino acids, circles indicate ect values of mutated amino acids. the box plot shows the |Δect| difference between gain-of-function  mutations and the cohort of nabn and hsnp  variants ; dark horizontal lines and the triangular symbol represent median and mean values respectively, with the box representing the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers the 5th and 95th percentiles, and the dots the outliers




we next analysed bct values and found that pathogenic nav <dig>  mutations are characterized by higher variations of Δbct compared with non-pathogenic mutations and polymorphisms . indeed, |Δbct| was significantly higher in gain-of-function mutations compared with nabn and hsnps .

figure  <dig> shows the network inter-residue connectivity of the iem-associated mutations i848t and n395k, both characterized by very high Δbct values. i <dig> is located in s4-s <dig>  and i848t causes a significant hyperpolarising shift in activation, a slow deactivation and an increased response to small-ramp depolarisations in drg nociceptors  <cit> . i <dig> is predicted to interact with s4-s <dig>  and pore  through i <dig> and f <dig>  which have with very high bct values . upon mutation, the interatomic bond interactions between dii  and diii  are interrupted and therefore Δbct shifts to a negative value  showing lower ebct values . conversely, n395k mutation forms interdomain hydrophobic  and h-bonds , leading to a positive Δbct  and higher ebct values.fig.  <dig> network inter-residue connectivity of the iem-associated mutations i848t and n395k. a the graph shows the nav <dig>  sodium channel topology and highlights the amino acids i <dig>  and n <dig> . inter-domain bond interaction are depicted in red for the iem associated mutation i848t and in green for the iem associated mutation n395k. b

Δbct distinguishes with high specificity pathogenic nav <dig>  mutations from variants not causing disease
the in-silico topological analyses described in figures  <dig> and  <dig> was computed for all the pain disorder-related mutations , and for all the  <dig> nabn and  <dig> hsnps variants showed in fig. 2c. the results showed that the only topological parameter that differs significantly between gain-of-function mutations and non-pathogenic amino acid changes is the |Δbct| value . indeed, 83% of nabn variants and hsnps were characterized by |Δbct| values < <dig> . the remaining 17% showed |Δbct| values > <dig>   . according to our nav <dig>  model structure, most of nabn and hsnps, which are evolutionary variable, are located in vsd and p-loop domains and are predicted to be exposed to the lipid interface .fig.  <dig> summary of ∆bct values for all nabn and hsnp variants and gain-of-function mutations. a ∆bct values of all the nabn and hsnp variants  and all the gain-of-function mutations  analysed in this study. dashed lines indicates the cut-off value  that maximizes sensitivity and specificity. b intra- and extracellular view of the nav <dig>  and locations of amino acids affected by gain-of-function mutations  that are linked with iem, sfn and pepd and control group variants . localization of iem, sfn and pepd related mutation showed in red . *the m <dig> residue shares the same position with the sfn-related m1532i mutation which causes in vitro biophysics changes and m1532v variant belongs to the control group.c receiver operating curve  of gain-of-function mutations and control mutations  as a function of Δbct. using a cut-off value of ±  <dig> , Δbct correctly classified  <dig> out of  <dig> controls and  <dig> of  <dig> gain-of-function mutations yielding 76% sensitivity and 83% specificity. the area under the curve is  <dig>  




twenty-three out of  <dig>  gain-of-function nav <dig>  mutations had |Δbct| >  <dig>  and are located in vsd, pore and s4-s <dig> of di, dii, diii and div domains . the remaining  <dig> mutations  had |Δbct| < <dig>   . these pathogenetic mutations with small |Δbct| variation are located in vsd of di  and diii  or in s4-s <dig> linker of diii , are highly evolutionary conserved residues  and are predicted to be exposed outside the core of the channel .

according to these results, we hypothesized that Δbct might provide enough sensitivity and specificity to distinguish gain-of-function mutations from control variants. using the cut-off value  that maximizes sensitivity and specificity, Δbct correctly classified  <dig> out of  <dig> controls variants  and  <dig> out of  <dig> gain-of-function mutations, yielding 76% sensitivity and 83% specificity. the area under the roc curve analysis for the Δbct scores was  <dig>  .

discussion
many phenomena can be modelled as collections of elements that interact through a complex set of connections. network theory has become one of the most successful frameworks for studying these phenomena  <cit>  and has led to major advances in our understanding of ecological systems  <cit> , social and communication networks  <cit> , brain connectivity  <cit>  and metabolic and gene regulatory pathways in living cells  <cit> .

using network theory, protein structure can be described as mathematical graphs  <cit>  that represent the interatomic connections. the topological features of amino acid residues, named nodes, can be described using centrality measures that define the reciprocal relationship in terms of connectivity and capability to influence other nodes within the network. we focused on the topological analysis of nav <dig>  gain-of-function mutations identified in patients with painful disorders. we considered a homology model of the nav <dig>  pore in the closed state and calculated the interaction of the nodes within the network through several measures of topology.

our findings show that Δbct values tend to be significantly higher in nav <dig>  pain-related mutations than in control groups . bct represents the influence that the shortest communication pathways have on the overall interatomic connections. nodes with high bct value could efficiently integrate signals  and the reduction of bct value caused by single amino acid substitutions suggests that the signalling transfer capability of the network is decreased. conversely, the increase of bct value suggests that a mutated node could facilitate the load transfer through the shortest communication pathways. therefore, changes in Δbct reflect increased or decreased potential for connectivity of amino acid within the protein and provides numerical values about how single amino acid substitutions might act as a bottleneck for specific nodes linking different parts of the network. previous studies of network topological parameters revealed that effective allosteric communications can be primarily provided by structurally stable residues that exhibit high bct  <cit> . therefore, bct might provide a novel and useful tool for identifying allosteric hotspots in comparison with other centrality measures as previously suggested  <cit> .

using the cut-off value  that maximizes sensitivity and specificity, our data show that Δbct correctly classified  <dig> out of  <dig> controls variants  and  <dig> out of  <dig> gain-of-function mutations, yielding 76% sensitivity and 83% specificity. the area under the roc curve value for the Δbct scores was  <dig>  . by contrast, our data show that none of other topological parameters  differ significantly between controls and gain-of-function nav <dig>  mutations. although these data suggest that the pain-related nav <dig>  gain-of-function mutations do not have significant effects on the degree of connectivity, local clustering connectivity of the neighbour nodes  and eccentricity , it is important to consider that our results derive from homology modelling constructed on the closed-state pore domain of nav <dig> . a given residue may have a number of distinct interaction networks within the channel protein throughout the gating cycle, thus our modeling captures a snap shot of these interactions, and future studies are needed to further investigate interaction networks within the channel protein throughout the gating cycle.

our nav <dig>  modeling also suggests a link between Δbct value and the buried or exposed nature of an amino acid substitution. indeed, gain-of-function mutations predicted to be buried inside or close to the core of the channel have higher |Δbct| than the overall mean |Δbct| = <dig>   or the cut-off value  . conversely, gain-of-function mutations predicted to face the lipid interface  have lower |Δbct| than the overall mean |Δbct|   or the cut-off value |Δbct|  . similarly, most of the control variants  predicted to face the lipid interface have low |Δbct|  . hence, in our nav <dig>  model, mutations predicted to be buried into the core of the channel show higher |Δbct| than those exposed at the interface of the membrane. this finding suggests that lipophilic interactions within the cell membrane may be disturbed by the mutations. additional studies are required to more definitively assess the changes in lipophilic interactions that are produced by these mutations. irrespective of the underlying mechanistic/molecular explanation, some pathogenic mutations would be missed by our method. thus, Δbct should be regarded as a novel in-silico screening tool in addition to existing common predictive algorithms  that could help in selecting pathogenetic mutations for functional testing.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that most of the pathogenic nav <dig>  mutations identified in patients affected by severe painful disorders could be predicted, according to our homology modelling, to cause profound changes in the amino acid connectivity of the channel. such modification may underpin the gain-of-function effects measurable in drg nociceptors by electrophysiological assays. based on these findings, we propose to consider bct may therefore be a marker of pathogenic shift in the mutant channels, though prospective experimental studies will be required to validate its effectiveness and its biological meaning.
