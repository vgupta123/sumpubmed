BACKGROUND
g. vaginalis has had a checkered taxonomic beginning. it was originally isolated by leopold  <cit>  and later associated with the vaginal disorder now referred to as bacterial vaginosis and named haemophilus vaginalis by gardner and dukes  <cit> . subsequently, metabolic requirements and gram staining led to its reclassification within the genus corynebacterium. greenwood and pickett suggested that the organism did not belong in this genus either and that it be placed in its own genus, named after its discoverer  <cit> ; a contention later supported by dna-dna hybridization  <cit> . gardnerella is in the family bifidobacteriaceae and is most closely related to species in the genus bifidobacterium. the cells are small, nonmotile pleomorphic rods, which may be piliated. the length of the rods and gram staining vary depending on the growth medium  <cit> . electron microscopy and the lack of lipopolysaccharide production demonstrates that the cell wall is gram-positive, although the peptidoglycan layer can be thinner than many gram-positive organisms, resulting in negative gram staining  <cit> . g. vaginalis is a fastidious organism and requires complex medium for growth. studies using metabolic methods of identification indicate that it is catalase-negative, exhibits α-glucosidase activity, starch hydrolysis, hippurate hydrolysis, acid phosphatase activity, but lacks gelatin and esculin hydrolysis, and salt tolerance  <cit> . g. vaginalis is anaerobic and can utilize the carbohydrates dextrin, fructose, glucose, maltose, ribose, starch, and sucrose through fermentation. some strains ferment mannose, galactose, and sucrose, and a few strains ferment xylose and trehalose but it does not ferment mannitol, raffinose, rhamnose, or sorbitol  <cit> .

despite the fact that bacterial vaginosis  is the leading vaginal disorder globally, very little is known about its etiology or pathogenesis. it fails to conform to any of koch's postulates; it is not associated with a single bacterial species, no single species has ever been found to reliably elicit the disorder in healthy women, and the adaptation of the bacterial species involved to life in the human host has precluded the development of a useful animal model. gardner and dukes identified g. vaginalis as the etiologic agent but findings that pure cultures did not always cause bv drew this allegation into question  <cit> . subsequent studies analyzed the role of additional species such as atopobium vaginae and mycoplasma hominis, but efforts have yet to unequivocally establish the role of a single species  <cit> . recent studies of the virulence properties of g. vaginalis have revealed its ability to adhere avidly to and establish a tenacious biofilm on the vaginal epithelium in women with bv and have characterized the molecular basis for its cytotoxicity  <cit> . these virulence studies along with findings that g. vaginalis is the only species that can be detected in the vast majority of cases of bv and increasing reports of extravaginal infections in which it is the only species isolated, such as bacteremia and osteomyelitis, have drawn this species back into the spotlight and resurrected the notion of its pathogenic potential  <cit> .

the role of g. vaginalis in bv has also been disputed because the organism can inhabit the genital tract of healthy women  <cit> . however, the numbers of g. vaginalis on the vaginal epithelium of healthy women are several logs lower than the numbers found in women with bv  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported recently that the biotypes of g. vaginalis isolated from healthy women differ from those isolated from women with bv  <cit> . the lack of genetic characterization of this organism leaves open the possibility that distinct pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains or even subspecies exist. the human microbiome project, an effort supported by the nih, will soon produce a tremendous amount of genetic information about the bacteria associated with bv and efforts are underway to sequence strains of g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, and mobiluncus. in an effort to better understand the physiology and pathogenic potential of g. vaginalis, we performed whole genome sequence analysis of an isolate from a case of bv , and to determine whether isolates may vary in their pathogenic potential, we also performed whole genome sequence analysis of an isolate from a healthy woman . we analyzed the virulence potential of these two strains using a series of in vitro assays to quantify their cytotoxic activities, their ability to adhere to cervical epithelial cells, and their capacity for biofilm formation.

RESULTS
whole genome sequence analysis
pyrosequencing yielded high coverages of the bv-associated g. vaginalis strain, 5- <dig>  and the healthy subject isolate, amd  genomes . the data for both genomes assembled into approximately  <dig> contigs greater than  <dig> bp. both genomes were estimated at approximately  <dig>  mb. in a mummer alignment of the genomic sequences, the minimum percent identity between the two strains was  <dig> % and the maximum was  <dig> %, with an overall average of  <dig> %. gbrowse sites were designed for strains 5- <dig> and amd http://www.gardnerella.mic.vcu.edu. overall gc content figures were  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , and the numbers of protein coding genes predicted were  <dig>   and  <dig>  . there was only one complete assembled copy of the ribosomal rna gene cluster, suggesting that all copies are identical or close to it. examination of contig boundaries suggests that there are at least two and probably three or four copies of the rrna gene cluster. the number of predicted trnas was identical in the two strains:  <dig> 

metabolic pathways in the two strains
analysis of the metabolic potential yielded interesting insights into the basis for the complex growth requirements of this fastidious organism  <cit> . metabolic pathways for amino acid synthesis are absent, apart from a few possible short conversions including fumarate to l-aspartate. pathways for o-glycan, n-glycan, peptidoglycan, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis seemed to be well populated with the required enzymes. in addition, many of the required enzymes that convert l-amino acids to d-amino acids were identified. the portions of the pentose phosphate pathway allowing synthesis of the required precursors of nucleotide biosynthesis were also present. purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways were represented by a number of enzymes, permitting synthesis of several  bases and nucleotides. interestingly, both strains appear to lack two enzymes that are essential for glycolysis; phosphofructokinase, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase. if the enzymes are truly absent, this deficiency could be partially compensated by the pentose phosphate pathway. another possibility is that g. vaginalis performs these functions using novel enzymes that were not identified in our similarity searches.

putative virulence factors in both strains
the only characterized virulence factor in g. vaginalis is vaginolysin  <cit> . vaginolysin is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that may contribute to virulence by making cellular contents more available as a substrate for bacterial growth. this cytolytic action may also have the coincidental effect of making the vaginal epithelium more permeable to hiv virions. the gene for vaginolysin, vly, in strain 5- <dig> exhibited 89% identity at the nucleotide level and 94% identity at the amino acid level to vly from g. vaginalis strains  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . vly from strains 5- <dig> and amd were 99% identical at the amino acid level, differing at a single amino acid .

analysis of the g. vaginalis genome revealed a number of additional putative virulence factors, including a gene with similarity to the p30/p <dig> adhesins . these adhesins are produced by species of mycoplasma and are involved in adherence to human tissues  <cit> . previous reports have demonstrated that fresh clinical isolates of g. vaginalis are piliated, but suggest that pilus production may be lost upon in vitro passage of the bacteria  <cit> . however, even though loci likely to be involved in pilus assembly were present , we were unable to identify pili by transmission electron microscopy of strains 5- <dig> and amd, even when the bacteria when in vitro culture was restricted .

proteins encoded in only one strain
orthomcl analysis was performed to identify proteins putatively present in only one strain . a number of these were small, hypothetical proteins that could represent pseudogenes and several did not exhibit significant similarity to any proteins of known function. strain 5- <dig> contained a number of putative phage proteins that were absent in amd. strain amd contained a number of putative serine-threonine kinases not present in 5- <dig>  however the role of these kinases was unclear from similarity searches. amd also contained an apparent toxin-antitoxin gene cassette. interestingly, the antitoxin protein exhibited 100% identity to a protein from a. vaginae and 65% identity to a protein from m. mulieris suggesting that horizontal gene transfer occurs between bv-associated bacterial species.

putative antibiotic resistance determinants
bv can be difficult to treat and the rate of relapse or recurrence is 50% within a year  <cit> . resistance to metronidazole, the drug of choice for bv therapy, has been seen in some strains of g. vaginalis, as has resistance to tetracycline  <cit> . we tested strains 5- <dig> and amd for in vitro susceptibilities to  <dig> different antibiotics . both strains were sensitive to tetracycline  and appeared to lack the tetm gene, found in tetracycline-resistant strains of g. vaginalis  <cit> .

therapeutically achievable levels of metronidazole are generally effective against bacteria with an mic < =  <dig> μg/ml, whereas those with an mic =  <dig> μg/ml are considered intermediate resistant and bacteria with an mic > =  <dig> μg/ml are considered resistant  <cit> . clinical cure rates of 75% have been reported for oral metronidazole therapy  <cit> . both strains exhibited intermediate resistance with mics of  <dig>  μg metronidazole/ml. the most well-characterized mechanism of resistance to metronidazole is inactivation or deletion of genes with nitroreductase activity  <cit> . both strains had nitroreductase genes  but the expression of the genes and functionality of the proteins was not determined in this study.

nalidixic acid resistance in g. vaginalis has been well established and strains 5- <dig> and amd both exhibited resistance with an mic above  <dig> μg/ml. the orfs gv51_ <dig> and gvamd_ <dig>  which are 98% identical, are predicted to encode a protein with similarity to multidrug efflux pumps in the mate  family. members of this family include staphylococcus aureus mepa, which has been shown to confer fluoroquinolone resistance so this may be involved in resistance to nalidixic acid .

the strains also exhibited intermediate resistance to kanamycin. both genomes contained a gene for a phosphotransferase enzyme family . this family includes proteins that inactivate certain aminoglycosides such as kanamycin. therefore it is possible that the product of this gene plays a role in permitting kanamycin resistance in g. vaginalis.

the genomes also encoded an emrb/qaca family protein , which could confer resistance to certain streptogramins, however, the strains were both susceptible to clindamycin and erythromycin, although strain 5- <dig> was more sensitive to erythromycin than was strain amd.

analysis of surface structures
because we had noted a difference in the level of aggregation and biofilm formation of the two strains when they were cultured in 10% human serum , we analyzed the surface of the bacteria by transmission electron microscopy. we observed a layer that resembled a polysaccharide capsule on the surface of strain 5- <dig> that was absent on amd .

cytotoxicity
despite the finding that the vly genes of amd and 5- <dig> encode nearly identical proteins, with only a single amino acid mismatch, cytotoxicity assays indicated that after  <dig> hour amd, the bv-isolate, induced rounding and other cytopathologic changes in a monolayer of me- <dig> cervical epithelial cells , and complete lysis of the monolayer by  <dig> hours . in contrast, me- <dig> cells exposed to the non-bv isolate, 5- <dig>  were still attached and exhibited normal spreading epithelial morphology after  <dig> hour  and had only begun to exhibit rounding and other cytopathogenic changes by  <dig> hours . strain 5- <dig> led to complete disruption of the me- <dig> monolayer after  <dig> hours  suggesting that vly from this strain was functional. to determine if differences in expression of vly could account for the reduced cytotoxicity associated with the commensal strain, we compared the vly promoter regions of the two strains and found that 5- <dig> was lacking  <dig> bp that were present in the amd vly promoter. however, quantitative realtime rt-pcr indicated that transcriptional expression of the vly gene was equivalent in the two strains .

adherence to epithelial cells
we analyzed the ability of the two g. vaginalis strains to adhere to cultured me- <dig> cervical epithelial cells was assayed by confocal microscopy. while equal amounts of the two strains were added to me- <dig> monolayers, adherence of strain amd was much more pronounced relative to that of the non-bv isolated strain 5- <dig> . it was also observed that strain amd was more aggregative than was strain 5- <dig>  this suggests that the capability of bv isolates to bind to and adhere to vaginal epithelium may be higher than non-bv isolates. as pilus expression could not be demonstrated in either strain, we searched for other putative adhesins. both strains harbored a biofilm associated protein  family gene . bap homologues in other species are involved not only in biofilm formation, but in adherence to epithelial cells as well, so we compared the sequences of the bap genes encoded by 5- <dig> and amd. clustalw alignment of the amino acid sequences of the bap family protein encoded by amd and 5- <dig> showed considerable sequence differences between the two proteins . the bap homologues had a highly repetitive structure as is characteristic of the other bap family proteins  and a majority of the sequence differences between the two strains were located within the region containing the b, c, and d repeats. bap is also predicted to contain several rib domains. rib domains were named after the rib protein of group b streptococcus, an immunogenic surface proteins with a highly repetitive structure  <cit> . the number and distribution of rib domains in the bap homologues differed between amd and 5- <dig> 

role of adherence in cytotoxicity
other cholesterol-dependent cytolysins depend upon adherence to exert their activity  <cit> . because we observed that amd exhibited increased adherence, we investigated the possibility that this was related to the greater cytotoxic activity associated with amd. g. vaginalis was added to transwell filters with a pore-size equal to either  <dig> μm, to allow the bacteria to penetrate the filter and make contact with the monolayer, or  <dig>  μm, to prevent direct contact of the bacteria and monolayer but to allow proteins to flow through to the me- <dig> s. we found that direct contact with the monolayer was required for cytotoxic activity , suggesting that the disparity in the adherence of the two strains could account for differences in cytotoxic activity.

capacities for biofilm-formation
the ability to form a biofilm is a marker of potential virulence and a cause of recurrent infections. since bap proteins are known to play a role not only in adherence but in biofilm formation in other species  <cit> , we chose to investigate whether the disparity in the sequences and expression of the bap homologues could translate into differences in biofilm forming activity. safranin staining of biofilms  produced by g. vaginalis strains amd and 5- <dig> after  <dig> hours of growth showed that the bv-isolate amd produced a thicker biofilm. quantitative measurement of biofilm growth as percentage of total growth indicated that amd had a significantly greater biofilm-forming capacity than the non-bv isolate 5- <dig> . the relationship between biofilm capacity and association with bv was further investigated using additional strains. we found that two other g. vaginalis bv-isolates, strains  <dig> and  <dig> produced similar levels of biofilm growth as did strain amd and significantly more than strain 5- <dig>  a second healthy isolate, strain  <dig>  showed significantly less biofilm growth than the bv-isolates . these data suggest that bv-isolates tend to produce more biofilm growth than do non-bv associated isolates of g. vaginalis, which would reasonably be consistent with greater virulence.

discussion
g. vaginalis can be isolated from the majority of bv cases but it can also be isolated, albeit at much lower numbers, from healthy women. very little is currently known about the genetic composition of g. vaginalis, the diversity of strains or about its physiology. it has been reported that certain biotypes of g. vaginalis are more frequently associated with bv  <cit> . in order to investigate the possibility that certain strains are more likely to be associated with bv, we sequenced a bv-associated strain and a healthy isolate and characterized their virulence potentials with a series of in vitro assays for cytotoxicity, adherence, and biofilm formation. we found that the bv-associated strain was significantly more cytotoxic than the non-bv isolate suggesting that differing levels of cytotoxicity may be related to the propensity of a strain to cause disease. proteins encoded by the vly genes differed by only a single amino acid and the promoters differed by only  <dig> bp. the disparity in the level of cytotoxicity of the two strains could be related to the amino acid substitution, but the residue is not near the active site or other amino acids known to play a key role in function  <cit> . the differences in cytotoxicity are likely a function of adherence. we found that strain amd adheres more avidly to cultured vaginal epithelial cells than does the non-bv isolate, 5- <dig>  therefore it is possible that the increase in cytotoxicity seen with strain amd is simply due to its ability to adhere and thereby deliver vaginolysin more directly to the eukaryotic monolayer. consistent with this hypothesis was the finding that a  <dig>  μm filter effectively blocked g. vaginalis-mediated cytotoxicity. if the toxic effector molecule produced by the bacteria was freely secreted in sufficient concentrations and the secreted form was cytotoxic, then phenotypic changes of the me- <dig> monlayer would have been seen even under conditions that prevented direct cell to cell contact, i.e. the  <dig>  μm filter. however the filter ablated cytotoxicity in me- <dig> s suggesting that direct contact between g. vaginalis and the vaginal epithelium is required for effective delivery of the vly gene product, as is the case with other cholesterol-dependent cytolysins  <cit> .

these results have also demonstrated a clear difference in the ability of various strains to adhere to cultured cervical epithelial cells. while both amd and 5- <dig> were able to adhere to the me- <dig> monolayer, amd exhibited heightened adherence. adherence is a prerequisite for infection, and these results suggest that bv isolates are able to adhere, and thus establish an infection much more readily than non-bv isolates. factors influencing the ability of a given strain to adhere to eukaryotic cells would be governed by the proteins and structures present upon the bacterial cell surface and the interaction between those factors and the me- <dig> surface proteins and structures. we found a gene encoding a biofilm associated protein  family protein. bap proteins are large, cell wall-anchored adhesins that can mediate both adherence to host cells and intercellular adherence, which contributes to biofilm formation  <cit> . interestingly, the gene sequences for amd and 5- <dig> bap were quite disparate. this was particularly noticeable in the repeat regions, the region of bap proteins that generally mediates adherence. we also noted that the healthy isolate appeared to be coated in a capsular structure, whereas the bv-associated isolated did not appear to express this structure. this may negatively impact adherence to vaginal epithelial cells, or biofilm formation. pneumococci produce a capsule that has been linked to a decrease in biofilm formation supporting this hypothesis  <cit> . both genomes contained multiple potential operons for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis although there was significant divergence in the proteins encoded by the two strains.

we also found a significant difference in the propensity of the two strains to form a biofilm in vitro. biofilm formation by g. vaginalis has recently been implicated in bv  <cit> . the ability for a strain to grow as a biofilm would likely confer resistance to mucosal immune defenses and antibiotic resistance, which could contribute to initial and recurrent colonization. furthermore, lactobacilli normally associated with the healthy vagina produce byproducts such as lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide that normally suppress the growth of anaerobes such as g. vaginalis, but biofilm formation leads to increased resistance to these byproducts  <cit> . therefore, biofilm formation may enable proliferation of g. vaginalis even in the presence of lactobacilli. finally, biofilm formation is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and appears to play a role in treatment failure and recurrence in cases of bv  <cit> . the difference in biofilm forming capacity between these two strains could be related to the differences between the respectively encoded baps. the differences in domain distribution within the central repeat region and, potentially more importantly, the number and distribution of the rib domains and repeats in strain amd could better promote adherence and/or bacterial aggregation. furthermore, our results were suggestive of a correlation between greater biofilm-forming capacity and association with bv.

this work clearly demonstrates strain differences between g. vaginalis isolates that could impact the ability of this organism to cause disease. the precise role for g. vaginalis in bv pathogenesis is still unclear, but this study suggests an explanation for the presence of this organism in the absence of bv. a limitation of this study is the restricted number of strains studied. advances in sequencing technology and the human vaginal microbiome projects, taking place at virginia commonwealth university and the university of maryland, will lead to the analysis of additional strains, which will reveal further insight into the role of the genetic background of g. vaginalis strains in pathogenesis and to clearly demarcate the differences between strains that are directly related to the propensity to cause disease.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that certain biotypes of g. vaginalis are unable or unlikely to cause disease while other strains are better suited to elicit disease. the results suggest that the strains that fail to elicit bv may not be able to adhere to, or form a biofilm on the vaginal epithelium as avidly as strains that cause bv. results from genomic sequence analysis identified significant differences between a strain associated with bv and a strain from a healthy subject. the sequencing data reveals genes that may be involved in virulence and opens up avenues for further study of the pathogenesis of bv.
