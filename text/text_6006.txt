BACKGROUND
in order to analyse genetic networks and stress response, real time polymerase chain reaction  is an important tool  <cit> . for several years high-throughput instruments e.g. the biomark system from fluidigm have enabled large scale quantitative pcr studies  <cit> . because of this and the possibility to analyse a large number of genotypes easily on expression chips  <cit>  a range of genome wide association studies  using expression data were conducted in the last years . expression quantitative trait loci  were detected first in medicinal studies in humans and later also in plants . in plants most eqtl studies were performed for complex pathways and aimed at a better understanding of the molecular networks  <cit> . whereas in biotic stress the resistance is often controlled by a single gene, responses to abiotic stresses such as drought stress are controlled by many genes  and so these processes are particularly suitable for high throughput expression analyses and genetical genomics approaches  <cit> . even in early developmental stages drought stress and drought stress induced premature leaf senescence have major influences on yield formation  <cit> . therefore, it is of prime importance to understand regulatory processes of drought stress  <cit>  and leaf senescence  <cit> .

in plants drought stress is initiated by water deficit in soil resulting in osmotic and oxidative stress and cellular damage  <cit> . this leads to defined drought stress responses for instance regarding the maintenance of turgor by an increase of osmoprotective molecules as soluble sugars , as well as measurable lower water content and decreased growth in the stressed plants compared to a control  <cit> . stress perception is assigned by special receptors, such as abscisic acid  receptors, hexokinases, or ion channel linked receptors  <cit> . the stress signal is then transducted for example via serine-threonine kinases, serin-threonine phosphatases, calcium dependent protein kinases, or phospholipases  <cit> . finally, the gene expression is regulated by effector genes coding for late embryo abundant  proteins, dehydrin, or reactive oxygen species  and transcription factors, such as myb, wrky, nac, ap2/erf, dreb <dig>  or bzip to activate stress responsive mechanisms, re-establish homeostasis and protect and repair damaged proteins and membranes  <cit> . besides the above mentioned genes, drought stress associated metabolites such as osmoprotectants, polyamines and proteins involved in carbon metabolism and apoptosis are part of drought stress tolerance  <cit> . disturbing the regulatory processes in drought stress response results in irreversible changes of cellular homeostasis and the destruction of functional and structural proteins and membranes, leading to cell death  <cit>  and decreased yield formation  <cit> . a huge transcriptome analysis for drought stress associated genes was done for example in barley  <cit>  and wheat  <cit>  showing differential response of genes involved in drought stress tolerance.

initiated by external signals e.g. various stresses such as drought, as well as by internal factors for example phytohormones leaf senescence often occurs as a natural degradation process at the final stage of plant development  <cit> . drought stress induced leaf senescence proceeds in three steps. perception of drought stress is the initiation phase in which senescence signals are transferred via senescence associated genes   <cit> . these are regulatory genes which often encode transcription factors regulating gene expression by binding to distinct cis-elements of target genes  <cit> . in the following reorganisation phase resources are transported from source  to sink  organs being important for yield formation  <cit> . with this translocation chlorophyll, proteins, lipids and other macromolecules are degraded and the content of antioxidants, aba and ros increases induced by a change in gene expression  <cit> . differentially expressed genes and their regulation during leaf senescence were identified by transcriptome analysis using microarrays in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . while the genes for photosynthesis and chloroplast development are down-regulated, the genes for the degradation of macromolecules and recycling of resources are up-regulated  <cit> . for example, expressed genes for chlorophyll degradation are pa <dig>  lhcb <dig> and psba  <cit>  and genes for n mobilization and transport are transcription factors wrky  <cit>  and nac  <cit>  as well as glutamine synthetase  <cit> . genes differentially expressed can be grouped to those accelerating leaf senescence and genes delaying leaf senescence  <cit> . the latter possibly resulting in a “stay green” effect and improved drought tolerance  <cit> . the reorganisation phase is the crucial step for reversibility, after which senescence is irreversible and leads to the final step where leaves and cells often die  <cit> .

in barley , a crop plant of worldwide importance, most mechanisms for leaf senescence are still not well understood  <cit> . the response to drought in juvenile stages is less well documented, as only few studies are focused on early developmental stages  <cit>  whereas a lot of studies were conducted for drought stress in the generative stage  <cit> . nevertheless, barley is to some extent a model organism for research at a genome wide level. the barley gene space has been published  <cit>  and with this information gene positions can be compared to these data. comparing the position of the analysed genes in the morex genome with positions of the detected eqtl, resulted in the co-localization of eqtl and genes involved in drought stress  <cit> . therefore, the present study aimed at the identification of eqtl in barley for genes involved in drought stress in the juvenile phase and early leaf senescence  based on a genome wide association study.table  <dig> primer pairs for the selected genes and the reference gene

discussion
drought stress and leaf senescence genes
as shown by the significantly decreased spad values at 27 days after sowing , drought stress had an accelerating influence on natural leaf senescence in barley . furthermore, the drought stress answer in this juvenile stage was observed by differential expression of  <dig> genes induced by drought stress or leaf senescence .

a <dig> is a gene which is induced by aba or abiotic stresses like drought, cold and heat  <cit> . in the present study expression under drought stress was higher than in the well watered treatment . this was also shown by several studies first in barley  <cit>  and other species including transgenics . dehydrins  are well known to be expressed under dehydration stress  <cit> . for instance dhn <dig> is described to be up-regulated under drought stress in barley  <cit>  which was also found in this study . the glutamate decarboxylase gene  is regulated by calcium and the protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the reaction of glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid   <cit> . gaba may be involved in drought stress  <cit>  by up-regulation of genes encoding a gaba receptor  <cit>  which was also shown in the present study . the nadp-dependent malic enzyme-like  is involved in lignin biosynthesis, and regulates cytosolic ph through balancing the synthesis and degradation of malate  <cit> . as described in a drought stress study on barley, this effect is used for control of stomatal closure during the day under water-deficit conditions  <cit> . comparable to the present study  the gene for nadp_me turned out to be higher expressed under drought stress  <cit> . the delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase  <dig> gene  is included in proline synthesis  <cit> . content of proline is still controversially discussed as an indicator for drought tolerance  <cit> , but it was shown in a previous study that the proline content increased under drought stress  <cit> . for approving its role, this gene was selected and showed up-regulation under drought stress . up-regulation under drought stress was also observed in tobacco  <cit>  and transgenic rice  <cit> .

the contig <dig> is a senescence associated gene  which is up-regulated under drought stress, as also shown by guo et al.  <cit>  in barley for drought stress during the reproductive stage. other analysed sags are hv_ <dig> and phvnf-y5α, which were down-regulated in most genotypes under drought stress in our study  whereas in literature reverse effects are described. the gene hv_ <dig> is a sag <dig> like gene which is a senescence associated cystein protease and turned out to be up-regulated during natural leaf senescence in barley  <cit>  and during dark induced senescence in tobacco  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana the gene nfya <dig> similar to phvnf-y5α was analysed by microarrays showing that the expression of this gene was induced by drought stress and aba treatments  <cit> , as well as under nitrogen stress  <cit> . our data indicate a specific regulation of these two genes under different conditions. the protein encoded by the glutamine synthetase  <dig>  gene was found in photosynthetic tissues where its main role is the re-assimilation of photorespiratory ammonia  <cit> . during senescence, the activity of gsii decreased representing down-regulation of associated genes in rice  <cit> , barley and wheat  <cit>  which was confirmed in the present study . with chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence the light harvesting complexes  of psi and psii remain stable, but synthesis rates of apoproteins of lhc decrease early in senescence  <cit> . in the present study lhc1b <dig> was down-regulated for most genotypes during drought stress induced leaf senescence in juvenile barley  which was also shown in rice  <cit>  and barley  <cit>  for natural leaf senescence in the generative stage.

in this study, all five selected drought stress genes were up-regulated under drought stress  according to literature which demonstrates a clear drought stress answer and a good experimental setup for detecting and analysing drought stress response. in contrast, four out of the five selected genes for leaf senescence were down-regulated  because a few of these genes are involved in photosynthesis and chloroplast development. results for three of these genes  were in accordance with results known from literature, while this was not the case for two of them . however, for all of these genes the adverse effect was detected for some genotypes . results revealed that drought stress in early developmental stages of barley leads to premature induced leaf senescence as already observed by physiological parameters  <cit>  and by expression analysis of drought stress and leaf senescence related genes in this study.

expression differences in three genes  were significantly associated to barley chromosome 3h at  <dig>  cm . at this position also quantitative trait loci  were found for drought stress  <cit>  as well as for leaf senescence  <cit> . these facts and the high correlation of these genes  make this eqtl very interesting for marker assisted breeding in barley.

genes out of gwas
to verify the qtl identified for drought stress and drought stress induced leaf senescence by wehner et al.  <cit>  an expression profile and eqtl analysis was conducted with genes coding for proteins identified within respective qtl. the genes etfqo, sapk <dig>  triur <dig> and avp <dig> were differentially expressed .

the protein encoded by the electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase gene  is located in the mitochondria where it accepts electrons from etf, transfers them to ubiquinone and acts downstream in the degradation of chlorophyll during leaf senescence  <cit> . expression studies showed that etfqo is up-regulated under darkness induced leaf senescence  <cit>  whereas in this study on drought stress induced leaf senescence no clear direction was observed . a gene coding for a serine/threonine-protein kinase  was analysed which can be activated by hyperosmotic stress and aba in rice  <cit> . in the present study sapk <dig> was down-regulated in most genotypes . furthermore, the abscisic acid-inducible protein kinase gene  which is also involved in dehydration stress response  <cit>  was differentially expressed. until now, no relative expression analysis has been conducted for this gene, but a huge amount of aba inducible genes are up-regulated under drought stress in rice  <cit> . in the present study triur <dig> was also up-regulated under drought stress . the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase gene  is a gene which is up-regulated under drought stress  <cit>  which was confirmed in the current study . expression of this gene was also observed in transgenics showing a higher drought stress tolerance .

three of these genes  were located within the qtl on barley chromosome 5h at 45 cm  <cit> . furthermore, expression differences of two of them  were again associated to markers on chromosome 5h around 45 cm  and this position was also validated in the morex genome . a high and significant correlation between the relative expression data of both genes as well as to the relative spad values  promotes this finding. at the same position on chromosome 5h two markers which turned out to be significantly associated to spad and biomass yield under drought stress treatment were identified  <cit> . so, these results  <cit>  and those of this study give hint that the two snp markers, i.e. bopa1_9766- <dig> and scri_rs_ <dig> may be used in marker based selection procedures in barley breeding programmes aiming at the improvement of drought stress tolerance.

for the understanding of complex mechanisms, such as the process of drought stress tolerance and drought stress induced leaf senescence as a basis for future breeding activities it is of prime importance to understand how and when regulatory genes are activated and where they are located in the barley genome. results of this study contribute to elucidate the regulation of drought stress induced leaf senescence during early developmental stages in barley. the present genetical genomics approach helps to localize and understand transcriptional regulation and gene interaction, both from cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors . when analysing the expression regulation of the barley genome, cis eqtl were found for the genes a <dig>  gad <dig>  phvnf-y5α, etfqo and triur <dig>  markers which were significantly associated to cis eqtl explained up to  <dig>  % of the transcriptional variance . therefore, most of the strongest eqtl acted in cis which was also observed in previous eqtl studies  <cit> .

factors that act in trans regulating the expression levels of the genes of interest were mainly found for the group of leaf senescence genes. some of these genes are described as sags , because up to now little is known about their function. results of the present study give hint that these sags are regulated in trans.

CONCLUSIONS
with respect to the expression of genes involved in drought stress response and early leaf senescence genotypic differences exist in barley. major eqtl for the expression of these genes are located on barley chromosome 3h and 5h. the eqtl on chromosome 5h coincides with the qtl for drought stress induced leaf senescence identified in a previous gwas  <cit> . respective markers, i.e. bopa1_9766- <dig> and scri_rs_ <dig> may be used in future barley breeding programmes for improving tolerance to drought stress and early leaf senescence, respectively.
