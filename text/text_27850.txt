BACKGROUND
follicular lymphoma  is a b-cell neoplasm that represents the second most common form of b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma . an important role for inherited genetic susceptibility for fl has been supported by recent genome-wide association studies  where three independent susceptibility alleles have been identified in the hla class i 
 <cit>  and class ii  regions
 <cit> . follow-up hla sequencing studies revealed that rs <dig> is in complete linkage disequilibrium  with the drb1*0101-dqa1*0101-dqb1* <dig> extended haplotype, and rs <dig> is highly correlated with drb1*15-dqa1*01-dqb1*06
 <cit> . an independent inverse association with fl risk also was found for dpb1* <dig> <cit> . because previous gwas only attempted to validate the top  <dig> variants associated with fl
 <cit> , here we conducted a meta-analysis of the top  <dig> snps from existing gwas data in  <dig> fl cases and  <dig> controls from denmark/sweden  and the san francisco bay area  to identify new genetic variants and further elucidate the genetic basis of fl. validation genotyping of associated snps was conducted in  <dig> fl cases and  <dig> controls from an independent nhl case–control study population . the effect of validated snp genotypes on gene expression levels also was investigated using publicly available microarray data.

RESULTS
after excluding the snps previously tested for validation in the two gwas
 <cit> ,  <dig> snps located in  <dig> independent loci were associated with fl at a p-value threshold of 1×10− <dig> in the random-effects meta-analysis . for each independent locus, we selected the snp with the lowest p-value and removed markers in ld. of the remaining snps, only those with evidence of association from at least a secondary marker in the gwas were taken forward to validation. among the  <dig> independent snps selected for validation in the sf nhl <dig> study, two snps, rs <dig> and rs <dig>  located on 6p <dig>  in the hla class ii region, were validated in this third independent population . in the combined analysis of all three studies, rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  were associated with fl at a genome-wide significant level .

*p-values and ors estimated from the meta-analysis were identical for the random- and fixed-effects models.

to determine whether rs <dig> and rs <dig> are independently associated with fl risk, we adjusted our models for the previously identified fl-risk loci, rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs6457327
 <cit> . the results showed that rs <dig> was no longer associated with fl after conditioning on rs <dig> in any of the studies . further, rs <dig> and rs <dig> are in high ld , also suggesting that the signal observed for rs <dig> is not independent of the previously validated protective rs <dig> allele
 <cit> . in contrast, rs <dig> maintained independent statistical significance when each snp was fitted in the logistic regression model . because rs <dig> maps 6 kb downstream of the hla-dpb <dig> gene, we also tested the independence of rs <dig> with hla-dpb <dig> alleles including dpb1* <dig>  an allele inversely associated with fl based on hla sequencing studies of the sf-nhl <dig> study population
 <cit> . haplotype analysis in the sf-nhl <dig> data showed a significant difference in the frequencies of the hla-dpb1*0301-rs <dig> haplotype in cases versus controls  and the ld analysis suggested that rs <dig> was in ld with hla-dpb1* <dig> . when dpb1* <dig> was included in the model, rs <dig> was no longer associated with fl , indicating that although rs <dig> is independent of previously reported fl-associated snps, its influence on fl risk cannot be delineated from the protective hla-dpb1* <dig> allelic association. nonetheless, through rs <dig>  this study provides the first validation of the hla-dpb <dig> locus as protective in the pathogenesis of fl in two additional independent studies .

to explore whether rs <dig> affects hla-dpb <dig> gene expression, we used two publicly available mrna expression datasets from the muther
 <cit>  and gen cord
 <cit>  projects. we found a strong correlation between the protective rs <dig> a allele and increased hla-dpb <dig> expression in all lymphoblastoid cell lines in both datasets , indicating that enhanced hla-dpb <dig> expression may play a protective role in the etiology of fl. this hypothesis is in line with previous studies where reduced hla class ii expression on hodgkin reed–sternberg cells and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma  tumor cells has been associated with poor survival for classical hl
 <cit>  and dlbcl
 <cit> , respectively. based on a recent hla sequencing study of fl
 <cit> , we showed that the protective versus deleterious hla-dpb <dig> alleles possess oppositely charged glutamic acid rather than lysine residues at position  <dig> in binding pocket  <dig>  factors that may influence peptide affinities for hla-dpb <dig> <cit> . the present study suggests that an additional mechanism involving effects on hla-dpb <dig> expression may also influence fl risk. further studies will be needed to confirm and clarify the specific mechanisms through which reduced hla-dpb <dig> expression may contribute to deregulated cellular processes that drive fl and its progression.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we found that rs <dig> was inversely associated with fl risk independent of previously published fl snps, but not independent of the hla-dpb1* <dig> allele. elevated levels of hla-dpb <dig> transcripts found in the presence of the protective rs <dig> a allele suggest that changes in hla-dpb <dig> expression may be involved in the etiology of fl. these findings emphasize the important role of hla genetic variation in fl disease etiology and the need for further studies to clarify the mechanisms through which hla class ii expression contributes to fl pathogenesis.
