BACKGROUND
central post stroke pain  can develop following a vascular lesion of cortical and subcortical structures  <cit> . cpsp was first associated with thalamic infarcts by two french neurologists  <cit>  and they termed this condition « thalamic syndrome ». however, further investigations suggested that central pain could be induced by stroke in other structures all along the spinothalamic pathway  <cit> . development of pain in stroke patients is of great concern since it deteriorates their quality of life making daily activities difficult, compromising rehabilitation efforts, altering mobility, concentration, mood  <cit>  and eventually leading to depression  <cit> . little is known about the treatment of this condition and therefore cpsp management represents a real medical challenge and requires further understanding of its mechanisms.

cpsp is characterized by spontaneous and evoked pain  <cit> . allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, can be typical clinical signs recognized in patients and they are induced by thermal  and mechanical stimuli  <cit> . in recent population-based studies, cpsp incidence between  <dig> % and  <dig> % is reported amongst stroke patients  <cit> . some studies suggest that the prevalence of cpsp depends on the location of the lesion and it appears to develop more commonly after medullar infarctions or thalamic lesions  <cit> . a higher incidence occurs following a hemorrhage in the posterolateral and dorsal thalamic nuclei   <cit> . additionally, it seems that right sided lesions predominate in cpsp patients at both cortical and thalamic levels  <cit> . functional imaging studies have helped us to identify structures involved in cpsp  <cit>  and ventroposterior  thalamic nuclei play a key role in this condition  <cit> .

many mechanisms have been proposed to explain central neuropathic pain  <cit> . in central pain, nociceptive neuronal hyperactivity suggests a central sensitization mechanism possibly involving n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptors  <cit> . ketamine, a well-know nmda receptor antagonist, has been used to treat various neuropathic pain disorders  <cit> . furthermore, the use of ketamine to treat cpsp has been shown efficacious in cpsp patients  <cit> . therefore nmda receptors could play an important role in cpsp.

the use of animal models can help us understand the mechanisms involved in cpsp and allow testing of new therapeutic approaches for this condition. wasserman and koeberle  <cit>  were able to recreate central pain by injecting collagenase within the ventroposterolateral thalamus nucleus of rats creating an intracerebral hemorrhage. the objectives of the present study were to evaluate if central pain persists over a longer period of time, using wasserman and koeberle’s model, and to evaluate in a preliminary study if ketamine could be used for the alleviation of pain in this model.

RESULTS
following surgery, some rats  in the collagenase group were reluctant to be manually held and vocalized during manipulations. these occurrences were never observed prior to the surgery, neither were they observed in our previous experiments using a peripheral neuropathy rat model.

evaluation of the central pain model
motor coordination evaluated with the rotarod test
no significant difference between sham and collagenase groups was observed on the rotarod test . results are shown in figure  <dig> 

heat hyperalgesia evaluated with hargreave’s test
at baseline and during the first part of the experimentation, there was no significant difference between experimental groups for both hind limbs . results are shown in figure  <dig> 

mechanical allodynia evaluated with von frey filaments
results are presented in figure  <dig>  prior to surgery, there was no difference in mechanical sensitivity for both hind paws when comparing sham and collagenase groups. following surgery, significant differences in mechanical thresholds occurred in the right  and left  hind paws in the collagenase group. in the sham group, no difference was seen between baseline values and post-surgical results.

evaluation of cold allodynia with the acetone test
animals in the sham group never had reactions to acetone that were different from baseline. these animals either didn't move or lifted their paw rapidly only once at the acetone application. conversely, an increase in the number and duration of movements in the collagenase group with acetone  was seen with peak reaching up to 57% of rats on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-surgery. some of these animals would have marked reactions with either duration being around 10s, or number of movements being as high as  <dig> . right and left hind limbs were affected in these animals. however, these results failed to show any statistical significance when compared to the sham group. the percentage of animal in the collagenase group that reacted to acetone slowly decreased and the reactions were comparable to baseline by the end of the study.

evaluation of ketamine
rats from the sham and the collagenase groups received a single ip injection of ketamine  of  <dig>   <dig> and 25 mg/kg on respectively days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-surgery. behavioral tests started 30 min after the injection of the ketamine solution and the experimenter was blinded to the treatment drug and concentrations. injections of ketamine at  <dig> and 10 mg/kg did not affect the rotarod performance however with 25 mg/kg of ketamine, it was significantly impaired for animals in the sham  and collagenase  groups . the thermal sensitivity did not differ between sham and collagenase groups following the administration of ketamine at  <dig>   <dig> and 25 mg/kg . values were comparable to baseline suggesting that even the high dose of ketamine did not affect reflex activity. ketamine had an alleviating effect on mechanical allodynia . with  <dig> and 10 mg/kg, there was no effect on mechanical sensitivity in either hind paw however with 25 mg/kg of ketamine mechanical allodynia was reduced in the contralateral  and ipsilateral  hind paws.

plasmatic ketamine concentrations
at the end of the study ,  <dig> rats  from the sham group were used to evaluate the plasmatic concentration of ketamine following an ip administration of  <dig> or 25 mg/kg. following 10 mg/kg ketamine ip, mean plasmatic concentrations at 30 min,  <dig> and 2 h post administration were respectively 78 ±  <dig>  48 ±  <dig> and 22 ± 8 ng/ml. following 25 mg/kg ketamine ip mean plasmatic concentrations at 30 min,  <dig> and 2 h post administration were respectively 142 ±  <dig>  96 ±  <dig> and 59 ± 25 ng/ml. maximal concentrations following 25 mg/kg seen at 30 min and 1 h post-ketamine administration range from  <dig> to 204 ng/ml.

histopathological evaluation
microscopic evaluation of brain slices from the sham group showed no necrotic neuron and no astrocytosis in the vpl nucleus. in the collagenase group, small well circumscribed lesions were observed in the lateral thalamic nuclei  . on h&e sections, neuronal, and in some cases neuropil degeneration was observed and a large number of small nuclei was present in the lesioned areas, most probably reactive astrocytes. a marked decrease in the number of normal neurons is appreciated with the cresyl violet stain . reactive astrocytes  are clearly seen with gfap immunochemistry at the site of the lesion . with gfap immunohistochemistry, some mineralization  was observed in the vicinity of the lesion. the contralateral side of the corresponding thalamic lesioned area was uneventful.

discussion
in this study, we used a model of central pain in rats induced by an intrathalamic hemorrhage in the ventroposterolateral nucleus  <cit>  to evaluate the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain and assess ketamine as a potential therapeutic drug. we observed a significant mechanical allodynia up to 30 days after the intracerebral lesion, and a transient cold allodynia in up to 60% of these animals. no heat hyperalgesia occurred in the lesioned animals. these results reflect clinical signs such as mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia seen in human with post-stroke pain  <cit> . we also found that only the highest dose of ketamine administered  was able to alleviate the mechanical allodynia. however since animal were also affected on the rotarod, a decrease of motor control could be a confounding variable.

mechanical and cold allodynia, have been described in patients with thalamic stroke  <cit> . in one particular study among cpsp patients, allodynia was relatively common with a higher incidence in patients with thalamic lesions  <cit> . tactile hypoesthesia may also occur in the absence of tactile allodynia whereas normal tactile detection threshold can be associated with the presence of tactile allodynia  <cit> . in our experiment, a decrease in the mechanical allodynia threshold in both hind paws appeared following surgery and persisted over time. these results are concordant with those of wasserman and koeberle  <cit>  who observed mechanical allodynia for 7 days following the collagenase injections. mechanical allodynia has also been reported following kainate lesions in the vpl, however, animals were not tested beyond 48 h  <cit> . wasserman and koeberle  <cit>  reported that mechanical allodynia was unilateral and contralateral to the side of the lesion which could be associated with some methodological differences as baseline evaluations were not performed and the mechanical sensitivity was evaluated for a short period.

change in thermal sensitivity, either to cold and less often to hot temperatures, is commonly found in cpsp patients  <cit> . in our study we didn’t observe a decrease in heat threshold following the intracerebral hemorrhage. la buda et al.  <cit>  and wasserman and koeberle  <cit>  noted a heat sensitization for  <dig> and up to 21 days, respectively. wasserman and koeberle  <cit>  used the hot plate test which could give different results from our findings with hargreave’s test. we have no clear explanation for these difference results at the present time.

abnormal sensitivity to cold has been described in cpsp patients  <cit> . the prevalence of cold allodynia varies between  <dig> and 66% in cpsp patients with thalamic lesions  <cit> . conversely, one study reports that cpsp patient suffered mainly from cold hypoesthesia  <cit> . our results reflect findings in human patients as cold allodynia appeared as a sporadic sensory abnormality  <cit> .

bilateral sensitization to thermal and mechanical stimuli has been reported in rodent following unilateral electrolytic or demyelinating lesions in the spinothalamic tract and following a hematoma targeted at the basal ganglia, extending into thalamic nuclei  <cit> . in a mouse model of left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke, hyperesthesia developed in both hind paws and mechanical allodynia was present only in the ipsilateral side of the lesion  <cit> . lesion of lateral thalamic neurons or projection fibers to the intralaminar thalamic nuclei could explain our findings since disinhibition in these nuclei may occur with vpl lesions  <cit> . nociceptive intralaminar thalamic neurons have very large often bilateral receptive fields and if sensitized could account for the bilateral signs observed in our study  <cit> . in rats, there are also bilateral projections to the thalamus from spinothalamic neurons which may explain bilateral signs  <cit> . in human, bilateral sensory abnormalities have been described in a few cases  <cit> . bilateral hypoesthesia to cold and warm has been reported in cpsp patients  <cit> . bilateral processing of pain hypersensitivity has been shown to occur in human and can be explained by changes involving the putamen, thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex, which may all participate in the bilateral spread of pathological pain resulting from unilateral injury  <cit> . all these proposals may explain bilateral pain following a unilateral lesion of spinothalamic structures however they are speculative and need to be addressed in future experiments.

the neuropathy onset following collagenase injection was rapid in our animal model. in humans, few patients develop central pain immediately after the stroke and it occurs in the majority of patients within  <dig> to 3 month of the stroke  <cit> . in only one retrospective analysis of  <dig> patients with thalamic hemorrhage, the delay to develop thalamic syndrome was between  <dig> and 15 days after the lesion  <cit> . we have no clear explanation for the difference between findings in the animals and clinical findings in human. one hypothesis would be that plasticity and neuronal reorganization are faster in rodent’s nervous system than in humans. although, we have not performed chronic evaluations , persistence of mechanical allodynia was well established in our study which leads us to suspect that this model is suitable to study chronic central pain syndrome mechanisms.

in humans, ketamine can alleviate allodynia and hyperalgesia associated with chronic neuropathic pain state of either peripheral or central origins  <cit> . in a randomized, double blind crossover study with ketamine, continuous and evoked pain  in patients suffering central dysesthesia following spinal cord injury, was markedly reduced  <cit> . our study shows that relatively high doses of ketamine could reduce mechanical allodynia induced by an intrathalamic hematoma in the thalamus. there were no effects of ketamine for both the saline and collagenase groups on the hargreave’s test, which suggest that the high dose did not affect reflex activity. with von frey filaments, it is the sensitivity to the mechanical touch stimulus that is evaluated, the reaction time component of this task is not measured, and we would therefore suggest that ketamine does have an effect of mechanical allodynia.

evaluation of plasmatic concentration following injection of the different doses in rats revealed that the minimal effective plasma concentration of ketamine  was achieved only in a few animals at 25 mg/kg ip, which is the same plasmatic therapeutic concentration needed for treatment of neuropathic pain in humans  <cit> . eide et al.  <cit>  have shown that there was a highly significant correlation between the serum concentration of ketamine and the reduction of continuous pain following a single bolus administration of the drug. however, unique administration could be of short duration if a targeted plasmatic concentration is necessary to treat central pain. other beneficial effects with chronic administrations could be associated with the modulation of synaptic plasticity over time. unfortunately, high dose of ketamine impaired motor coordination which would be detrimental in cpsp patients. reported side effects in human include among others dysphoria, sedation, light-headedness  <cit>  as well as motor impairment, delirium, amnesia, anxiety, and panic attacks  <cit> . long-term use of ketamine for the management of cpsp should be recommended only after weighing the pros and cons with the patients as well as considering first other therapeutic strategies.

allodynia and hyperalgesia in cpsp patients may result from neuronal hyperexcitability which may be related to central sensitization  <cit> . since ketamine appears to reduce mechanical allodynia following intrathalamic hemorrhage, nmda receptors activation may be one of the mechanisms generating cpsp. blockade of nmda receptors reduces central pain by decreasing neuronal hyperexcitability  <cit>  and therefore this drug is justified for the treatment of central neuropathic pain. in central pain, damage to neurons from excitatory amino acids  related to nmda receptors over-activation could be a contributing factor to the pathology  <cit> . the evaluation of ketamine in this model was done at the end of our study and it was only performed as a preliminary study for future investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
a unilateral intracerebral thalamic hemorrhage in rats following injection of a collagenase solution within the right vpl caused bilateral allodynia. a long lasting mechanical allodynia developed soon after the surgery. some animals also developed a transient cold allodynia. administration of ketamine, a nmda receptor antagonist, decreased ipsilateral mechanical allodynia. these results suggest that nmda receptors may be involved in the sensitization mechanism of central post-stroke pain.
