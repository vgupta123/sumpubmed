BACKGROUND
high concentrations  of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate can accumulate in the brain and are thought to be involved in the etiology of a number of neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer's disease  <cit> . a number of in vitro studies indicate that at high concentrations, glutamate is a potent neurotoxin capable of destroying neurons  <cit> .

the mechanisms by which glutamate-induced neurotoxicity or excitotoxicity is mediated, has not been established, however, a substantial body of evidence suggests that glutamate toxicity involves oxidative stress and apoptosis   <cit> . this latter form of cell death is characterized by dna degradation that results by cleaving dna at internucleosomal sites  <cit> . apoptosis is a gene-directed process and an increasing number of genes and their proteins are involved in this process  <cit> . we have previously reported that in a stable mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line , glutamate-induced cell death is associated with dna fragmentation and up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein bax and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  however, in this cell line, the apoptotic process did not appear to involve caspase- <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, recent studies demonstrate that a family of cysteine proteases  play an important role in apoptotic cell death observed in some neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . caspase- <dig> is considered to be the central and final apoptotic effector enzyme responsible for many of the biological and morphological features of apoptosis  <cit> . caspase- <dig> usually exists in the cytosolic fraction of cells as an inactive precursor that is activated proteolytically by cleavage at a specific amino acid sequence to form the active enzyme  <cit>  which is capable of cleaving several proteins that culminate in apoptotic cell death  <cit> . although these observations strongly indicate that caspase- <dig> is essential for apoptosis in mammalian cells, the mechanisms involved in caspase- <dig> regulation of the neuronal system remain to be elucidated. many signal transduction pathways such as fas receptor-mediated signaling pathway via caspase- <dig>  via activation of granzyme b, or the damage of mitochondria that results in cytochrome c release, have been implicated in the initiation of caspase- <dig> cascade  <cit> .

a number of studies have demonstrated that estrogens are potent antioxidants capable of inhibiting some of the neurotoxic effects of oxidative stress  <cit> . we, and others have shown that estrogens can increase cell survival and attenuate in vitro cell death induced by various neurotoxins  <cit> . we have also previously demonstrated in ht <dig> cells and in the neuronal-like pc <dig> cell line derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells that the neurotoxic effects of glutamate can be inhibited differentially by various equine estrogens  <cit> . the data further indicated that the less estrogenic  Δ8-estrogens were the most effective neuroprotectors  <cit> . we further suggested that the increased potency of these Δ8-estrogens may to some extent, be due to their greater antioxidant properties  <cit> . however, the mechanism involved in estrogen mediated neuroprotection are not fully understood. in the present study, we have determined whether glutamate-induced neuronal apoptosis in primary cortical cells and its inhibition by estrogen, involves changes in caspase- <dig> protease and whether this process is mediated by fas receptor and/or mitochondrial signal transduction pathways involving release of cytochrome c. the estrogens selected for this study were 17β-estradiol  which has high affinity for both estrogen receptors erα and erβ and Δ <dig>  17β-estradiol , an estrogen that is a more potent antioxidant than 17β-e <dig> and whose activity appears to be mediated to a greater extent via erβ  <cit> .

RESULTS
effects of various concentrations of glutamate on cortical cell viability
cortical cells  cultured for  <dig> days in 96-well plates were treated with increasing concentrations  of glutamate for  <dig> h. as depicted in figure  <dig>  increasing concentrations of glutamate resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability measured by the mts  cell proliferation assay as described under "methods". generally as the amount of glutamate increased, cell death increased progressively, however, there was no significant difference between  <dig> and  <dig> mm glutamate in  <dig> h. similar results were obtained after treatment with glutamate for  <dig> h . based on these preliminary data, all subsequent experiments were carried out for  <dig> h at glutamate concentrations between  <dig> to  <dig> mm. at these concentrations, the mean percent cell death was approximately 20%.

demonstration of apoptosis in cortical cells treated with glutamate
cortical cells cultured in poly-lysine coated 6-well plates for up to  <dig> days were treated with  <dig> mm glutamate for  <dig> h. dna was extracted, purified and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis as described under "methods". the results indicate , that in dna isolated from untreated cortical cells prior to culture , untreated cells in culture for  <dig> day  no dna fragmentation was detectable. however, after  <dig> and  <dig> days in culture, dna fragmentation was detectable . the extent of dna fragmentation was potentiated in cells treated for  <dig> h with  <dig> mm glutamate . these results indicate that cortical cells in culture for longer than  <dig> days display characteristic dna fragmentation or laddering that is associated with apoptosis mediated via caspase- <dig> activation. glutamate treatment as can be seen in figure  <dig>  lane  <dig> induced a much greater dna fragmentation than untreated cortical cells. however, these are qualitative data and should be interpreted with caution, particularly since some dna fragmentation occurs in untreated cells. glutamate-induced enhancement of apoptosis was also detectable by characteristic morphological changes observed by using phase contrast microscopy . after  <dig> h in culture, untreated cortical cells retained normal morphology of neuronal cortical cells and their cellular extensions  and membranes were clearly visible. an occasional degenerated cell was also visible . in contrast, after a  <dig> h incubation with  <dig> mm glutamate degenerated, dead or apoptotic cells were clearly visible in these cultures , and the cellular extensions seen in untreated cortical cells , were retracted, and cells appeared rounded. similar changes were also observed with  <dig> mm glutamate . in the presence of  <dig> mm glutamate and  <dig> μm, 17β-e <dig>  and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> , the cells retained the normal morphology of untreated cells, and only an occasional degenerated cell was visible. these results clearly confirm that glutamate induces and enhances apoptosis. these morphological changes and cell death were prevented by both estrogens. taken together, these data indicate that cortical cells in the presence of glutamate undergo apoptotic changes in culture.

effects of glutamate and estrogens on cell death
cortical cells were cultured in 6-well plates  for  <dig> days. the medium was then changed and the effects of various concentrations  of glutamate on lactate dehydrogenase  release were measured for  <dig> h. the results indicate that glutamate induced a significant  increase in ldh release compared to the control untreated cells. no significant difference in ldh release was observed in  <dig> h at glutamate concentration between  <dig> to  <dig> mm, . based on these observations and the cell viability data , all subsequent experiments were done in the presence of  <dig> or  <dig> mm glutamate to avoid potential necrosis which may occur at higher concentration of glutamate. in order to follow the kinetics of glutamate cytotoxicity, the effect of  <dig> mm glutamate on ldh release as a function of time was measured for up to  <dig> h. the results shown in figure  <dig> indicate that glutamate toxicity varied markedly during the course of culture. significant increase  in cytotoxicity was observed after  <dig> to  <dig> h exposure of cells to glutamate. during this period, ldh release in untreated control cells remained the same for up to  <dig> h and significantly increased  after  <dig> h . next, cortical cells were treated with  <dig> mm glutamate for  <dig> h in the presence or absence of various concentrations  of 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>  release of ldh from cells was measured and the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  both 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> inhibited glutamate-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner, with Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> being more potent. thus,  <dig>  μm Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> and  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> significantly reduced cell death compared to glutamate alone . however, even at the highest concentration of estrogens tested, cell death induced by  <dig> mm glutamate was not fully preventable. in contrast, when cell death was induced by lower concentration  of glutamate,  <dig> μm of Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> completely inhibited cell death and the release of ldh returned to control levels .

effects of glutamate and estrogens on caspase- <dig> protein levels
following measurement of ldh, cortical cells were harvested, lysed and processed for western blot analysis as described under "methods". the results  indicate that both anti-caspase- <dig> antibodies detected the presence of caspase- <dig> mr  <dig> kda protein band , but not the p  <dig> and p  <dig> active fragments of caspase- <dig>  the results further indicate that the exposure of cells to glutamate resulted in an increase in caspase- <dig> precursor protein in a dose  and time , dependent manner. thus,  <dig> to  <dig> mm glutamate increased caspase- <dig> protein levels by  <dig> to 66% respectively, however, higher concentrations of glutamate  did not result in any further increase in caspase- <dig> protein levels . the kinetics of glutamate effects on caspase- <dig> protein levels indicate that a significant increase in the levels occurred by  <dig> h of glutamate  exposure and reached maximum levels observed at  <dig> h  . the levels were significantly lower at  <dig> h , most likely due to decreased transcription of caspase- <dig>  these results further indicate that changes in levels of caspase- <dig> occur soon after induction of apoptosis. lack of further increase in caspase- <dig> protein levels suggest that cell death at this late stage may be due to necrosis and therefore all subsequent experiments were carried out for up to  <dig> h only. these glutamate-induced changes were reversed in the presence of estrogens. thus, increasing concentrations of 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> in the presence of  <dig> mm glutamate for  <dig> h resulted in a decrease in caspase- <dig> levels in a dose-dependent manner . as depicted in figure  <dig>  glutamate  alone increased the levels of caspase- <dig> by 60% and in the presence of  <dig> to  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig>  the levels of caspase- <dig> protein decreased gradually and returned to control values with  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig>  similar results were obtained with Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>  however, significant decrease  in the levels of caspase- <dig> occurred at  <dig> times lower concentration  . when cell death was induced with lower concentration  of glutamate,  <dig>  μm 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> completely inhibited the changes in caspase- <dig> protein and the levels returned to control values . whether the ability of low concentrations of estrogens to fully protect the cortical cells against neurotoxicity induced by  <dig> mm glutamate was due to the cell death resulting via predominantly apoptosis rather than necrosis or a mixture of the two processes remains to be investigated.

effects of caspase inhibitors, z-devd and z-vad, on glutamate-induced cell death
to further confirm the role of caspase- <dig> in glutamate-induced cell death, cortical cells were pre-incubated with  <dig> μm of z-devd or z-vad prior to induction of cell death by  <dig> mm glutamate. glutamate alone caused a significant increase in cell death over control , while pre-incubation with the caspase- <dig> inhibitors prior to glutamate exposure resulted in a 50% reduction in cell death . in absence of glutamate, both inhibitors had no effect on cell viability . similarly, dmso, the vehicle used in the preparation of the inhibitors had no effect on cell viability . these data confirm that in primary culture of rat cortical cells glutamate induces cell death via the apoptotic pathway that involves changes in caspase- <dig> protease.

activation of caspase-3
 effects of caspase inhibitors on proleolytic cleavage of protein kinase c  in untreated primary cortical cells and cells treated with glutamate
during apoptosis, activation of caspases including caspase- <dig> can result in the generation of breakdown products  of pkc  <cit> . primary cortical cells were either treated with glutamate alone or first pretreated with caspase- <dig> specific inhibitor z-devd or pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad as described under "methods". the immunoblots are depicted in figure  <dig>  glutamate treatment resulted in an increase in the formation of two bdps  in both the cytosol and cell lysates. pretreatment with z-devd and z-vad reduced the amounts of the two bdps to levels seen in the untreated primary cortical cells . these results clearly indicate that pro-caspase- <dig> is activated and that active caspase- <dig> is present in primary cortical cells and cells treated with glutamate.

 detection of active caspase- <dig> in primary cortical cells treated with glutamate
western blot analysis had indicated the presence of pro-caspase- <dig> in primary cortical cells treated with glutamate . to detect the presence of active caspase subunits, highly specific active caspase- <dig> antibody raised against amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  of murine caspase- <dig> was obtained from stratagene. primary cortical cells were treated with  <dig> mm glutamate for  <dig> and  <dig> h and processed as described under "methods". the results  indicate that glutamate treatment for  <dig> h, did not significantly change the levels of caspase- <dig> active form. however, as can be seen  after  <dig> h of glutamate treatment, the levels of caspase- <dig> active form increased over  <dig> fold compared to untreated cells . these results further confirm that caspase- <dig> is activated in apoptosis induced by glutamate in primary cortical cells.

effects of glutamate on fas receptor protein expression
to determine whether the regulation of caspase- <dig> in glutamate-induced cell death in cortical cells is modulated by fas receptor mediated apoptotic pathway, expression of fas receptor protein was evaluated by western blot analysis. the results indicate  that anti-fas receptor antibody reacted specifically with fas receptor protein, however, no significant changes in the levels of this protein were observed following treatment with various concentrations  of glutamate  for up to  <dig> hours  compared to control levels.

effects of glutamate and estrogen on the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol
to determine whether the activation of caspase- <dig> in glutamate-induced cell death requires cytochrome c, primary cultures of cortical cells were first incubated with  <dig> mm glutamate for up to  <dig> hours. the cells were then processed for western blot analysis as described under "methods". the results depicted in figure  <dig> clearly indicate that prior to glutamate treatment, the bulk of cytochrome c is localized in the mitochondria and barely detectable levels were observed in the cytosol. in contrast, exposure of cells to glutamate resulted in a rapid release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol . significant increase in cytosolic cytochrome c occurred as early as  <dig>  h, and after  <dig> h, the levels of cytochrome c were higher in the cytosol compared to the mitochondria . by  <dig> h, the levels of cytochrome c in the cytosol were  <dig>  times higher than those in the mitochondria. the cytosolic levels of cytochrome c between  <dig>  hours to  <dig> hours were  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher in the cytosol prepared from glutamate treated cells compared to untreated cells . concomitant with these changes in the cytosol, the mitochondrial levels of cytochrome c decreased significantly. similar results were also observed when  <dig> mm glutamate was used . exposure of cortical cells to  <dig> mm glutamate and  <dig> μm 17β-e <dig> or Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> for  <dig> hours resulted in a significant decrease in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol . thus, the levels of cytochrome c in the cytosol from estrogen-treated cells were  <dig> to 50% lower than the corresponding levels in the glutamate alone treated cells .

discussion
in the present study, we used primary fetal rat cortical cell cultures to demonstrate that glutamate can induce neuronal cell death by apoptotic mechanisms and that the process can be reversed or inhibited by equine estrogens such as 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig>  our results further indicate that glutamate-induced cell death appears to result, to some extent, by a mechanism that involves dna fragmentation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. these changes are similar to those we and others have reported previously with other neuronal cell models  <cit> . unlike the mouse hippocampal cell line ht <dig>  <cit> , the primary cultures of rat cortical cells after day two in culture appear to undergo some degree of apoptotic cell death in absence of glutamate , however, the extent of dna fragmentation is significantly enhanced after treatment with glutamate. moreover, compared to the ht <dig> cells, the primary rat cortical cells appear to be resistant and require higher concentration of glutamate to induce apoptosis. similar differences were also observed between ht <dig> cells and pc12-neuronal cells derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma  <cit> . the glutamate induced dna fragmentation and subsequent cell death was associated with characteristic morphological changes also noted previously in ht <dig> cells following treatment with β-amyloid and glutamate  <cit> . the results from the present study indicate that these morphological changes associated with apoptosis were prevented by 17β-e <dig> and Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> . to quantitatively estimate the extent of cell death induced by glutamate, we measured cell viability by mts assay and cell death by ldh activity released in the media during culture. results from the mts assay clearly indicated that cell viability was dependent on the dose of glutamate . thus, increasing concentrations of glutamate resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. because in the mts proliferation assay, cells cannot be reused, subsequent quantitative experiments were carried out using ldh release assay. the ldh assay had previously been validated using the mts assay  <cit> .

in the present study, we further observed that glutamate induces cell death of primary rat cortical cells and involves changes in caspase- <dig> protease. exposure to glutamate up-regulated caspase- <dig> protein levels while caspase inhibitors blocked this apoptotic process. these observations indicated that cell death induced by glutamate in primary cortical neurons was via apoptosis.

caspase- <dig> was one of the cysteine proteases that played an essential role in apoptosis by cleaving several key cellular proteins such as poly  polymerase , sterol-regulatory element-binding protein , pkc, dna-dependent protein kinase, dna-fragmentation factor  and a number of others  <cit> . our studies show that up-regulation of caspase- <dig> expression preceded neuronal cell death, supporting the possibility that glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death was the consequence of up-regulation of caspase- <dig> gene in cortical neurons. these observations are consistent with up-regulation of precursor caspase- <dig> in frontal neuronal cortex of subjects with alzheimer's disease  <cit> . this enzyme has been proposed to activate death effector molecules resulting in the fragmentation of genomic dna and was associated with morphological and structural changes characteristic of apoptosis  <cit> .

when cells undergo apoptosis, caspase- <dig> is initially present as pro-enzyme  that is subsequently transformed into the active heterodimeric complexes through a cascade of proteolytic events  <cit> . the active form of caspase- <dig> is composed of two subunits of mr  <dig> kda  and  <dig> kda , which are derived from proteolytic processing of the  <dig> kda precursor during apoptosis  <cit> . in our study, these p  <dig> and p <dig> forms of caspase- <dig> were not detected in glutamate-induced cell death by immunoblotting analysis with three different kinds of antibodies: i. a polyclonal goat antibody caspase- <dig> p <dig>  against the p <dig> fragment of caspase- <dig>  ii. a polyclonal rabbit antibody against caspase- <dig>  and iii. a monoclonal mouse antibody  . these observations suggest that either our antibodies are incapable of detecting these fragments or that cells may clear them rapidly as been observed in other studies  <cit> . since we observed that glutamate-induced cell death was effectively blocked by both caspase- <dig> specific inhibitor z-devd and pan-caspase-inhibitor z-vad, these data further provide evidence that caspase- <dig> protease is not only up-regulated, but is also activated during glutamate-induced cell death. that activation of pro-caspase- <dig> does indeed occur in glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death of primary rat cortical cells was confirmed by the demonstration that pkc, an endogenenous substrate of active caspase- <dig>  was cleaved into two  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda bdps  <cit> . the formation of these bdps is characteristic of caspase- <dig> like protease activity  <cit> . the formation of the two bdps was inhibited by caspase- <dig> specific inibitor z-devd and pan-caspase-inhibitor z-vad). these results strongly suggest that proleolytic cleavage of pkc involves active caspase- <dig>  these observations were further supported by the direct immunodetection of activated caspase- <dig> in the primary cultures of rat cortical cells treated with glutamate . the primary antibody was raised against amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of murine caspase- <dig> and this neo-epitope is present on the p <dig> subunit of cleaved caspase- <dig>  this antibody recognizes the p <dig> subunit but not the inactive pro-caspase- <dig>  <cit> . taken together these data strongly indicate that in our neuronal cell cultures, glutamate induces apoptosis that involves active caspase- <dig>  in contrast, it has been suggested that glutamate-induced cell death in ht <dig> mouse hippocampal cells appears to occur by apoptotic mechanisms that are independent of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . since in ht <dig> cells, glutamate also induced dna laddering, mitochondrial proteins such as apoptosis inducing factor  and endonuclease g  released in response to death signals may also play a role in the ht <dig> neuronal cell line  <cit> . whether similar caspase- <dig> independent pathways are also involved in glutamate-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of rat cortical cells remains to be investigated.

several signaling pathways are implicated in the initiation of the caspase- <dig> cascade; one of the well defined pathways for activation of apoptosis is fas receptor-mediated pathway  <cit> . fas is a cell surface antigen and a member of tumor necrosis factor  receptor family  <cit> . activation of fas by its ligand or an agonistic anti-fas antibody can transmit apoptotic signal by activation of caspase- <dig> and induces apoptosis in t-lymphocytes and malignant cells  <cit> . in vitro, cross-linking of fas antibody to its antigen increases caspase- <dig> activity and induces apoptotic cell death in jurkat cells  <cit> . however, in primary cortical cells, we did not observe any change in fas receptor protein levels following glutamate treatment. these results suggest that activation of caspase- <dig> in neuronal cortical cells and their apoptotic demise induced by glutamate is independent of fas receptor mediated pathway. however, the fas mediated pathway is complex and further studies are required to establish whether this pathway is or not involved in glutamate-induced cell death in cortical cells. in contrast to glutamate, chronic morphine administration has been shown to induce up-regulation of fas receptor and caspase- <dig> precursor protein in the rat neuronal cells  <cit> . thus, whether fas receptor mediated pathway plays a role in up-regulation of caspase protein or caspase- <dig> activation and apoptotic cell death may depend on the nature of neurotoxic agents being used.

another recently characterized mechanism for pro-caspase- <dig> activation involves translocation of the respiratory chain protein, cytochrome c , from mitochondria to the cytosol during the induction of apoptosis by a variety of different agents in non-neuronal and neuronal cells such as cerebellar granule cells  <cit> . cytosolic cytochrome c binds to apaf- <dig> in the presence of datp and this leads to the recruitment and activation of caspase- <dig> and subsequent activation of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . in mitochondria cytochrome c resides in the inter-membrane space and matrix as a soluble protein and it functions as an electron carrier in oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . the mechanism responsible for the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol is not known. cytochrome c release can occur upon interaction of pro-apoptotic protein with the outer mitochondria membrane protein such as bax  <cit>  or can be induced by interaction with elevated calcium or reactive oxygen species  with mitochondria. this results in mitochondrial dysfunction and a reduction in mitochondrial trans-membrane potential  <cit> . our present studies demonstrate that glutamate-induced cell death in primary cortical cells is accompanied by the early release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm that precedes changes in caspase- <dig> protease. although we were unable to directly detect by western blot analysis, the active caspase- <dig> fragments p <dig> and p <dig>  the presence of active caspase- <dig> was confirmed as discussed above. since there was a close correlation between the time course of cytochrome c release from the mitochrondria and changes in caspase- <dig> protease levels; it provides a possible mechanism whereby caspase- <dig> protease is not only up-regulated, but also activated by cytochrome c during glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death of primary cortical cells. whether cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to cytosol is involved in the regulation of caspase- <dig>  remains to be investigated.

we have previously reported that a number of equine estrogens, which are components of the drug cee  used extensively for management of vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, are potent antioxidants and protect neuronal cells against cell death induced by oxidized ldl and glutamate  <cit> . in keeping with these observations, the results from the present study indicate that in primary cortical cells, these equine estrogens prevent cell death by reducing glutamate-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase- <dig> protein levels. to our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates that equine estrogens can prevent glutamate-induced translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol in the rat primary cortical cells. previous studies have shown that 17β-e <dig> induces release of cytochrome c from heart mitochondria  <cit>  and also decreases cytosolic cytochrome c levels in hippocampus following global ischemia  <cit> . these observations indicate that equine estrogens protect against glutamate-induced apoptosis of primary cortical cells at least in part by inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. however, the mechanism by means of which estrogens reduce cytochrome c release from mitochondria is not yet fully understood. some have suggested that the mechanism of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection involves regulation of mitochondrial calcium  and bcl- <dig> expression  <cit> . exposure of glutamate has also been associated with an increase of cytosolic ca2+ in cortical cells  <cit>  and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein bax in neuronal cell line, ht <dig>  <cit> . whether these changes induced by glutamate are involved in the mitochondria release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, remains to be investigated.

the cortical neuronal cells used in the present study contain both estrogen receptors erα and erβ , and therefore whether the mechanism by means of which estrogens exert their neuroprotective effects remain to be elucidated. in general, the current evidence indicates that there are at least two mechanisms for estrogen action: i) the genomic mechanism mediated via two nuclear receptors erα and erβ, and ii) the non-genomic mechanism mediated via putative membrane receptors and these have been recently reviewed  <cit> . although the concentrations of estrogens that protect the cortical neurons from glutamate toxicity are pharmacological doses, these levels can however, be potentially attained in a postmenopausal women taking daily  <dig>  mg of   <cit> . these estrogen effects are most-likely mediated to some extent by the non-genomic mechanism, and may be related to the estrogens' antioxidant property  <cit> . this is in keeping with our previous observations that although 17β-e <dig> has higher affinity for erα and erβ, it is possible that some of these effects are due to the antioxidant properties of estrogens. however, we have also demonstrated  <cit>  that Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> expresses its biological effects to a two fold greater extent via erβ than 17β-e <dig>  <cit> . since the localization of erα and erβ in the brain is differential  further detailed studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective aspects of estrogens.

recent studies further report that estrogen receptor  is localized in the mitochondrial membrane and estrogen can directly modulate the mitochondrial content of ca2+ and mitochondrial trans-membrane potential  <cit> . the role of the novel estrogen membrane receptors in apoptotic cell death induced by glutamate remains to be investigated. we along with others, have previously demonstrated that estrogens prevent cell death induced by glutamate  <cit>  or β-amyloid  <cit>  via modulation of bcl- <dig> family of proteins. thus, it is possible that in the neuronal cell model, estrogens decrease glutamate-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria by protecting mitochondrial trans-membrane potential via binding estrogen receptor on mitochondrial membrane as well as up-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig>  studies to further delineate these mechanisms are being initiated.

CONCLUSIONS
in the primary cortical cells, glutamate-induced apoptosis is accompanied by up-regulation of caspase- <dig> that can be blocked by caspase protease inhibitors. these effects of glutamate on caspase- <dig> appear to be independent of changes in fas receptor, but are associated with the rapid release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which precedes changes of caspase- <dig> protein levels leading to apoptotic cell death. this process was differentially inhibited by estrogens with the novel equine estrogen Δ <dig>  17β-e <dig> being more potent than 17β-e <dig>  to our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that equine estrogens can prevent glutamate-induced translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol in rat primary cortical cells.
