BACKGROUND
the mammalian mitochondrial  dna, a circular double-stranded molecule, contains  <dig> genes, including thirteen protein coding genes,  <dig> transfer rna genes and two ribosomal rna genes. all protein coding genes are components of the mt respiratory chain : these are seven subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase complex i , one subunit  of the cytochrome cb <dig> complex iii, three subunits of cytochrome c oxidase complex , and two subunits of atpase complex v   <cit> .

particularly the high copy number in cells, its maternal inheritance, its high point mutation rate, the fact that recombinations are evidently occurring very rarely in mammals and other animals, as well as its compact architecture and small total size have made mtdna very popular for phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and population genetic studies for a wide range of taxa. the majority of these studies, however, implicitly considers mtdna as neutrally evolving and mtdna variability is usually interpreted to reflect the effects of gene flow and random drift, whereas molecular changes are supposed not to influence the fitness of the individuals.

whether mainly neutral evolutionary forces or adaptive evolution are shaping mtdna variation is contentiously debated . whereas there seems to be no major discussion on the fact that strong purifying selection is considerably affecting mtdna variability of mtoxphos genes in animals , mechanisms of how positive selection may shape spatio-temporal patterns of such genes are hardly explored. evidence of positive selection on segments of mitogenomes of various animal species has only relatively recently started to accumulate in the literature . moreover, as to our knowledge, even no preliminary view is at hand of how positive selection of coevolving mtoxphos genes might influence intraspecific mitogenome variability under different environmental contexts.

despite strong purifying selection already during the transmission of mtdna down the maternal lineages , less pathogenic  mutants harboured by heteroplasmic mothers and inherited to the next generation may result in retarded growth, disorders, or serious health problems in the offspring . over  <dig> point mutations in protein coding genes, trnas, and ribosomal rrnas of the human mitogenome have been reported to be associated with a wide range of clinical symtoms or diseases  <cit> . the majority of mtdna mutations that cause disease in humans are, however, considered mild to moderately deleterious and serious mutations are apparently effectively selected against along the maternal germ line, as suggested by the mouse model  <cit> .

although some  <cit>  suggested that a molecular signature of positive selection does not necessarily imply adaptation several hypotheses have been proposed to explain selection on mtdna. they all imply adaptation to different environmental conditions such us high altitude, climate change, temperature, colder climate, food availability, and habitat change . hares of the genus lepus were suggested to be a suitable group to study natural selection in mitogenomes given their recent evolutionary history and their wide distribution in contrasting environments  <cit> . analyses of eleven mitogenomes of different hare species of temperate and arctic origins by the latter authors have suggested positive selection on several codons of genes of the mtoxphos complexes, most notably affecting the arctic hare lineage. however, the structure and the physicochemical properties of the encoded proteins seemed to be not affected by these amino-acids substitutions. the authors  <cit>  concluded that the functional impact of the amino acid changes may have been underestimated by their analysis. moreover,  <cit>  have suggested that codon sites showing functional changes might not show a high ω value. by contrast, the codon sites where many amino acid substitutions occurr may be falsely predicted as positively selected sites because of a high ω value that is obtained by chance even if the substitutions were essentially neutral. therefore, in the absence of an appropriate statistical tool or experimental analyses, an adaptive or non-adaptive value of the positively inferred selected sites remains elusive.

in this study we test for selection on two mtoxphos genes, atp synthase  <dig> and nadh dehydrogenase  <dig>  in hares from a small region in north africa  where climatic and habitat conditions exhibit a dramatic clinal change from the mediterranean seaboard in the north to the arid sahara in the south along a short geographic distance , but without obvious physiographic barriers to gene flow. in fact, earlier population genetic and phylogenetic investigations  <cit>  revealed shallow differentiation in hares across this region on the one hand and the presence of only one hare species  on the other. for our current analyses we use the same individuals that have already been analysed in population genetic and phylogenetic terms; hence, the currently observed mtoxphos gene variation has been obtained from the same populations of mitochondria that have already revealed very shallow genetic divergence across the different climate zones in tunisia. under positive selection on those two loci and adaptation to different environments we expected significant changes of protein frequencies across the study region in addition to site-specific selection signals for the corresponding sequences. furthermore, we expected significant effects of ambient temperature or precipitation, as important climatic characteristics, on the occurrence of the most prevalent proteins encoded by the two loci. finally, we expected a significant signal of co-evolution of the two loci under study, particularly because the non-recombining mtdna can be considered as one linkage system. we observed co-evolution of the two loci, but positive selection on combinations of ancestral and derived proteins for atp <dig> and nd <dig>  and vice versa, in addition to a signal of positive selection on single positions of atp <dig> and nd <dig>  as well as ambient temperature effects on the occurrence of the most prevalent proteins.

methods
specimen samples and ecological characteristics of the study area
a total of  <dig> hares conventionally considered cape hares  were collected at eleven sampling sites in tunisia between  <dig> and  <dig>  the sampling localities ranged between close to the northern mediterranean seaboard at n 36° 55′ 17″ and the sahara at n 32° 52′ 34′. acronyms of sampling localities, geographic coordinates, positions within northern , central , and southern  tunisia, as well as sample sizes are given in fig.  <dig>  the whole sampling area expanded from the mediterranean humid and sub-humid bioclimatic zones in the north , characterized by mediterranean forest and scrubland , across the semi-arid central part of tunisia , with steppe vegetation including chenopods , to the arid and hyper-arid sahara in the south , with typical desert vegetation . it represents a remarkably steep climatic and ecological gradient across a straight distance of less than 450 km, with means of annual precipitation and temperature ranging between 477 mm and  <dig>  °c in the north and 52 mm and  <dig>  °c in the south, and aridity indices between  <dig>  in the north and  <dig>  in the south. whereas the coefficient of variability of the aridity indices for tunisia is amongst the highest of all african countries, mean annual temperatures do not vary to such an extent across whole tunisia  <cit>  and even less across our study area.fig.  <dig> sampling regions of hares from north, central and south tunisia. sample sizes appear in parentheses. hares were grouped into three populations according to climatic, geographic and phenotypic data. the north population with samples from two regions ; the central population with samples from six regions ; and the south population with samples from three regions . pie charts indicates protein frequencies  for atp <dig>  and nd <dig>  in the three populations




in addition to the tunisian samples, single specimens of lepus capensis from south africa , egypt, west of the nile , egypt, east of the nile , as well as single specimens of scrub hare, l. saxatilis, , and one brown hare, l. europaeus, from eastern austria  were included for outgroup comparison in the phylogenetic analyses of the tunisian atp <dig> and nd <dig> sequences/proteins .

dna extraction and pcr amplification
total genomic dna was extracted using the genelute mammalian genomic dna miniprep kit  from diverse tissues  protein coding sequences were performed according to  <cit> : 1) a 453 bp segment of the mt atp synthase  <dig>  gene from site  <dig> to  <dig> of the complete mt genome of the brown hare, lepus europaeus  <cit> ; and 2) a 409 bp segment of the mt nadh dehydrogenase  <dig>  gene from site  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . purification of amplicons was carried out using the wizard sv gel and pcr clean-up system  dna purification kit. forward and reverse strand sequencing was performed by macrogen inc., south korea. in addition, sequences of the hypervariable domain  <dig> of the mt control region  and genotype data of fourteen microsatellite loci of the same  <dig> specimens  <cit>  were included as non-coding markers to estimate levels of most likely neutral mitochondrial and nuclear genetic differentiation across the study region.

sequence analysis and diversity
sequences were edited and aligned by eye using the bioedit v. <dig> . <dig> program©, 1997- <dig>  <cit> . the following indices of dna polymorphism were estimated by using dnasp v. <dig>  <cit> : haplotype diversity , nucleotide diversity , the mean number of pairwise differences , and the number of segregating  sites . all indices were calculated separately for the combined populations of north , central , and south tunisia , respectively.

phylogenetic relationships of haplotypes
to reveal phylogenetic relationships of atp <dig> and nd <dig> sequences and the translated proteins, median-joining  networks  <cit>  were constructed, including all currently produced haplotypes based on equally weighted variable positions, by using network  <dig> . <dig>  . that approach allowed for the detection of possible alternative intraspecific pathways of protein evolution with the chance of identifying possible parallel protein evolution. our networks were phylogenetically rooted by the above mentioned outgroup sequences of lepus capensis, l. europaeus, and l. saxatilis.

detecting positive selection
to detect positive selection at single amino acid sites, the maximum likelihood  method  <cit>  implemented in codeml of the paml  <dig>  package  <cit>  was used. depending on ω values that represent the ratio of the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution, sites are expected to evolve neutrally  or under positive  or purifying  selection. different codon-based models that allowed for variable selection among sites as recommended by  <cit>   were tested: scenarios where non-synonymous mutations were neutral or deleterious  were compared with models that allowed for positive selection including an additional category for advantageous substitutions . pairwise comparisons of nested models were performed using the likelihood ratio test : twice the log-likelihood difference was compared with a χ
 <dig> distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between both models. in this way, the more general models m <dig> and m <dig> could be tested against m <dig> and m <dig> against m <dig>  when the lrt was significant, a bayes empirical bayes  method was used to calculate the posterior probabilities of codon classes in models m2a and m <dig>  posterior probabilities of >  <dig>  were considered as supported under the beb method  <cit> .

as alternative methods and in order to identify codons affected by positive and negative selection, fast single-likelihood ancestor counting , fixed effects likelihood , random effects likelihood  and mixed effects model of evolution  methods available in the hyphy package  <cit>  and in a free public web implementationon http://www.datamonkey.org  were applied to our atp <dig> and nd <dig> sequences using the best fit nucleotide model for each data set. the best fitting model was hky <dig> for both mtdna coding regions, as suggested by the program. after reconstructing ancestral sequences, slac compares normalized expected and observed numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per variable site. fel compares the instantaneous synonymous site rate  and the instantaneous nonsynonymous site rate  on a per site basis, without assuming a prior dn/ds distribution. rel allows for heterogeneity both in synonymous and nonsynonymous rates, by fitting discrete distributions of rates across sites and then inferring the rate per site. meme estimates the probability for a codon to have undergone episodes of positive evolution, allowing the ω ratio distribution to vary across codons and branches in the phylogeny. a detailed account of the slac, fel, and rel methods is given by  <cit> . details of the meme method are provided by  <cit> , who recommended this method for identifying sites under selection. significance levels of p <  <dig>  in slac, fel, meme and bayes factors >  <dig> in rel were considered as indication of positive selection. all tests described above were applied to single genes and to the concatenated sequences.

genetic differentiation
in addition to the atp <dig> and nd <dig> data, 461 bp long sequences of the hyper-variable part  <dig> of the mt control region  and genotypes of  <dig> microsatellites obtained earlier for the same individuals  <cit>  were used to estimate genetic differentiation between the three study regions . generally, under positive selection, one would expect higher differentiation in more conservative markers  compared to rapidly evolving ones  even in the same linkage system. therefore, a higher level of gene flow in the fast evolving microsatellites and mthv- <dig> sequences than in the atp <dig> and nd <dig> sequences would corroborate positive selection in the latter two genes. in such case, selection would counteract gene flow by shaping mtdna sequence polymorphisms of atp <dig> and nd <dig> in the different populations.

therefore, the amount of variation due to partitioning into the presently considered three regions  was calculated by amova models using arlequin  <dig>   <cit> , separately for atp <dig>  nd <dig>  mthv1sequences, and the microsatellite loci. the same program was used to quantify the degree of differentiation between and across regions by calculating pairwise fst. calculations were carried out separately for each mtdna domain based on haplotype sequences, and also based on the translated amino acid sequence frequencies for the atp <dig> and nd <dig> genes. pairwise fst values for microsatellite loci were calculated using the program genetix  <dig>   <cit> , and significance levels were adjusted by strict bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons after  <dig> permutations.

tests of protein frequencies across the three regions
frequencies of the two most prevalent proteins at either locus  were tested for significant differences between regions by three pairwise fisher’s exact tests using spss  <dig>  thereby, significance values  were adjusted by strict bonferroni correction to account for three tests per locus.

test of protein association and coevolution
to test for a significant association of proteins encoded by the atp <dig> and nd <dig> genes within individual mitochondria, pearson’s phi coefficient of association  was calculated for the two most prevalent proteins in hares from the ct region only, as protein variation was very low in the other two regions  . this coefficient represents a measure of co-occurrence of two binary variables and is similar in its interpretation to pearson’s correlation coefficient. it could be applied to the current data set, as only two proteins were revealed at high frequencies at each locus.

to specifically test for coevolution of atp <dig> and nd <dig> sites we used the codon-based bayesian spidermonkey approach implemented in datamonkey for our concatenated atp <dig> and nd <dig> sequences from ct. this approach reconstructs the substitution history of the amino acid alignment by maximum likelihood-based methods and analyzes the joint distribution of substitution events using bayesian graphical models to identify significant associations among sites  <cit> .

testing for effects of climate variables on protein occurrence and for co-occurrence of protein variants
given the reported effects of ambient temperature on mitochondrial protein-coding sequences in humans and fish  <cit> , a significant effect of ambient temperature on the presence of the presently detected protein variants would corroborate selection signals at the atp <dig> and nd <dig> loci as obtained from our molecular test statistics. thus, we used the statistical software package r  <dig> . <dig>  to run logistic generalized linear models  and model averaging statistics separately for the atp <dig> and nd <dig> proteins, to test for effects of climate indices on the occurrence of the two most prevalent protein variants at each locus. due to existing uncertainty in model selection, we used techniques of model-averaging and multimodel inference . thereby, model evaluation is based on the akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes  and all models  are averaged based on the probability  of this particular model being the best of all models explaining the data. this gives unconditional estimates . based on the akaike weights, we calculated the relative variable importance  for each variable, i.e., the probability of a particular variable to be present in the best model. this statistical approach is increasingly being applied to circumvent ambiguities in model selection . for our models we used climate statistics from the nearest weather stations to our sampling sites  <cit> . specifically, we used “mean annual temperature“ , “mean minimum temperature of the coldest month of the year“ , and “mean annual precipitation“  as predictive variables in addition to geographical position , as well as the protein variant  encoded by the respective alternate locus in the same individual. to facilitate the interpretation of the resultant factor coefficients, codes of the two respective protein variants for each locus were concordant .

first we run two logistic glms for presence/absence of the two most prevalent proteins  separately for atp <dig> and nd <dig>  to prove whether “mean annual temperature“  or “mean minimum temperature of the coldest month of the year“  had the highest explanatory value, given all other factors and variables in the models were identical. as “temp” resulted in a significantly more likely model than “mintemp“for the atp <dig> protein model , the variable “temp“ was used in all further atp <dig> protein models. for the nd <dig> protein models, however,”mintemp“was used for further modelling, as it resulted in a significantly more likely initial model than when using “temp“ .

consequently, the syntaxes of our statistical protein models were: m=glmatpab‐1~nd2ab+lat+long+prec+temp and m=glmnd2ab‐1~atpab+lat+long+prec+mintemp 


RESULTS
genetic diversity of atp <dig> and nd <dig> mtdna genes
the obtained atp <dig> and nd <dig> sequences resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> haplotypes with  <dig> and  <dig> variable sites and with a total length of 399 bp and 348 bp, respectively ; for more details of sequence variability see additional file 1: table s <dig> . both the atp <dig> and nd <dig> sequences translated into four amino acids sequences each, due to two and four non-synonymous positions, respectively . the phylogenetic relationships among the atp <dig> and nd <dig> haplotype sequences and their translation into amino acid sequences  are shown by the median joining networks in fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  based on our phylogenetic rooting of the networks by our outgroup taxa,  <dig> % of all atp <dig> haplotypes were represented by the ancestral protein a, and  <dig> % of all nd <dig> haplotypes were represented by the ancestral protein a. in atp <dig> protein b harbored six haplotypes in a star-like evolutionary pattern; one of those modern haplotypes gave rise to protein d, which was the youngest among all four atp <dig> proteins. atp <dig> protein c consisted of two evolutionarily closely related haplotypes that were derived from a modern haplotype within protein a. in nd <dig> protein d was derived by two different evolutionary pathways indicating parallel evolution. protein b and c were derived from evolutionarily young lineages of protein a; they harbored eight and one haplotypes, respectively. finally, the observed star-like phylogeny of several haplotypes of both mtdna sequence networks might suggest a rapid population expansion event. notably, a recent expansion event was also suggested by a significant bimodal distribution of the mthv- <dig> haplotypes  <cit>  and by the star-like phylogeny of the transferrin sequences  <cit>  of the same individuals.table  <dig> list of the atp <dig> and nd <dig> haplotypes from tunisia, sample size, geographical origins, and genbank accession numbers

patterns of positive selection on mtdna genes
the codon-based tests  for selection revealed specific codons to be under positive selection . the maximum likelihood models that allowed for positive selection fitted to the data of atp <dig> significantly better than those that assumed only neutral or deleterious mutations, but for nd <dig> positive selection was not confirmed by all tests . the ω estimates of the model m <dig>  indicated that purifying selection dominated the evolution of both atp <dig>  and nd <dig> . the lrt test for atp <dig> indicated that model m2a that allowed for positive selection, fitted better than model m1a that only considered conserved and neutral codon position . estimates using the m2a model suggested that among the two non-synonymous amino-acid changes , site  <dig> in atp <dig> was under positive selection. model m <dig> that assumed three site classes , fitted the data better than all the previous models . for nd <dig>  in the model comparison  the alternative model  was preferred over the null model indicating that substitutions in this gene might be selectively neutral. moreover, in nd <dig> the three sites suggested to be under positive selection by model m2a have a low posterior probability according to the beb analysis . the m2a model for the concatenated genes indicated positive selection for site  <dig> in atp <dig> and sites  <dig> and  <dig> in nd <dig> .table  <dig> results of paml analysis

the lrt test comparing two models  that both assume a beta distribution of ω over sites indicated that m <dig>  fitted the data better in both atp <dig> and nd <dig> than m <dig> . the estimates from m <dig> indicated that  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the sites were under diversifying selection in atp <dig> and nd <dig>  respectively. for atp <dig> one site was identified with a strong signal of positive selection . while the substitution at position  <dig> gave rise to the derived protein b from the ancestral protein a, the substitution at position  <dig> lead to protein c from protein a. for nd <dig>  the same model suggested that three sites were under positive selection  with a posterior probability of >95% for sites  <dig> and  <dig>  and a posterior probability of >90% for site  <dig> . substitutions at all those three sites with site  <dig>  lead to the modern protein b from the ancestral protein a . although, model  <dig> confirmed the detected sites under positive selection for the concatenated genes, lrt comparison  suggests that m <dig> was preferred to the alternative model .

the following paml results were confirmed by tests provided by the web server datamonkey: 1) site  <dig> of atp <dig> was identified to be under “episodic diversifying selection” with the meme  method. notably, site  <dig> at the atp <dig> locus produced the amino acid difference between the two main proteins  with an overall frequency of occurrence of  <dig> %; 2) various other sites of atp <dig> were identified as negatively selected, and depending on the methods used their numbers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; 3) for nd <dig>  no site showed any evidence of positive selection; however,  <dig>  to  <dig>  sites were identified to be negatively selected; 4) finally, site  <dig>  was confirmed by fel , meme  and rel  when applied to the concatenated genes and site  <dig>  was confirmed by the rel  test.

genetic differentiation of mtdna and microsatellite loci
the amova results for the mtdna sequences and the microsatellite genotypes on partitioning of genetic diversity among the three regions  are summarized in table  <dig>  for microsatellites only  <dig> % of the overall relative genetic variability was partitioned into the three regions. similarly, only  <dig> % of hv- <dig> sequence variability was due to partitioning among the three regions, when calculated from haplotype frequencies, and  <dig> % of the hv-1sequence variability was partitioned among regions, when calculated by means of the distance method. the partitioning of variability of the atp <dig> sequences among regions amounted to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, when calculated from haplotype frequencies and pairwise sequence distances, respectively. a similar level of partitioning was observed for nd <dig> . the amova models based on translated amino-acid frequencies in the three regions resulted in an fst of  <dig> % for atp <dig> proteins and an fst of  <dig> % for the nd <dig> proteins. leaving out the two non-synonymous nucleotide positions  of the atp <dig> sequences resulted in distinctly lower relative genetic differentiation  than that for the complete sequences  . pairwise f
stvalues of relative genetic differentiation between regions  reached a maximum of  <dig> %  for mthv1sequences and  <dig>  for microsatellites . the respective values were clearly higher for atp <dig>  and nd <dig>  sequences.table  <dig> partitioning of genetic variation  as calculated from the different markers at two levels

protein frequencies and co-occurrence of proteins
overall frequencies of the four atp <dig> proteins  amounted to a =  <dig> %, b =  <dig> %, c =  <dig> %, d =  <dig> % and frequencies of the two most prevalent proteins a and b varied significantly between regions in all pairwise comparison . overall frequencies of the four nd <dig> proteins  amounted to a =  <dig> %, b =  <dig> %, c =  <dig> %, and d =  <dig> %. frequencies of the two most prevalent nd <dig> proteins a and b, however, differed significantly only between regions ct and st , when accounting for multiple tests.

the pearson φ coefficient for association of the two most prevalent atp <dig> and nd <dig> proteins a and b, respectively, indicated a week  but significant  positive association between the ancestral atp <dig> a and the derived nd <dig> b proteins and vice versa in individual hares from the ct region.

the spidermonkey run indicated a significant interaction  between positions  <dig> at atp <dig> and  <dig> at nd <dig> with a posterior probability of  <dig>  for site  <dig> being conditionally dependent on site  <dig>  and with a posterior probability of  <dig>  for site  <dig> being conditionally dependent on site  <dig> 

models of atp <dig> and nd <dig> protein occurrence
the logistic glm runs and the model averaging statistics indicated a significant positive effect of “temp“ on the presence of the ancestral atp <dig> protein a  and a negative effect on the modern atp <dig> protein b, i.e., higher likelihood of presence at lower “temp“, independent of geographical position of the sampling site, precipitation, and the nd <dig> protein variant co-occurring in the same mtdna. however, there was also a significant negative effect of nd <dig> proteins on the occurrence of the atp <dig> a protein, independent of the other fixed factors/variables. relative variable importance values  of precipitation and latitude were not much above  <dig> , indicating no clear effects on the presence of atp <dig> protein a or b .table  <dig> summary results of the logistic linear model of occurrence of atp <dig> protein a or b after model averaging

discussion
several attempts have been made to understand positive  selection on mitochondrial  oxphos genes in the context of geographical and environmental characteristics such as geographical clines , altitude  <cit> , subterranean habitat  <cit> , and particularly in relation to ambient temperature variation . given the paramount role of mitochondria for cellular energy production, selective effects of ambient temperature on the mitochondrial genes encoding for the oxphos process is very plausible. positive selection on those genes may act particularly under heterogenous environments in terms of time and space. effects of ambient temperature on genetic variation in natural populations may, however, be obscured by other environmental factors that vary for instance geographically  <cit>  or by historical population genetic changes, particularly, if ambient temperature effects are not much pronounced. in addition, coevolution effects among mt oxphos genes on the one hand and within the mitonuclear gene complex responsible for the oxphos process on the other can be expected to blur positive selection signals at single sites . similarly, epistatic effects may produce certain clusters of non-synonymous sites within and among proteins  <cit> , particularly in functionally important and coevolving genes, as in the mt oxphos complex. such functional clusters of coevolving sites might also reduce the chance of detecting positive selection signals, if e.g., several of those sites are under purifying selection.

here we studied amino acid sequence variation at two mt loci of cape hares  from tunisia, across a steep ecological gradient within comparatively short geographic distances  from near to the northern mediterranean seaboard to the arid sahara zone in the south. in spite of marked variation of external phenotypes , all hares from our study range are genetically and phylogenetically closely related as revealed by our microsatellite and mthv <dig> sequence data . in fact, our current amovas of variation of ndna and mtdna indicated a low level of partitioning of genetic variability across the whole study area that was well within the range commonly found among populations of terrestrial mammal species; also, our earlier phylogenetic mthv <dig> sequence analysis indicated no major phylogenetic gap among the tunisian hares  <cit> . notably, those earlier phylogenetic and microphylogeographic results were based on the same individuals that we used for the presently obtained amino acid data. hence, the same individual mitochondria populations were used both for the microphylogenetic/phylogeographic information and the amino acid data. the phylogenetically rather homogenous gene pool and the shallow population structure of tunisian hares that display otherwise several external phenotypes provide a good precondition to detect positive selection related to environmental/climatic variation, specifically ambient temperature and precipitation.

indeed, we have proved positive selection to occur at the atp <dig> locus in the tunisian hares that translates into four proteins with two of them at a very high combined frequency of occurrence. moreover, the two most prevalent proteins at that locus are distributed at significantly varying frequencies across the study area with a higher frequency of the ancestral protein variant in the warmer southern sahara region and the derived protein at a higher frequency in the cooler mediterranean climate province in the north. concordantly, we found a significant effect of mean annual temperature on the presence of the ancestral or the most prevalent derived atp <dig> protein, with the occurrence of the ancestral protein variant being favoured at higher temperature and the most frequent derived protein being favoured at lower temperatures. apparently, this seems to be a general effect of ambient temperature as it is independent of the geographic sampling location .

for nd <dig>  the second locus under study, a signal of positive selection was also obtained by several of the used codon-based tests. accordingly, the nd <dig> protein frequencies differ also significantly between the three discriminated ecological regions. moreover, the significant effect of ambient temperature on the occurrence of the two most frequent nd <dig> protein variants independent of geographic sample locations corroborates our site based-test results. remarkably, occurrence of the two most frequent nd <dig> protein variants, the ancestral and the most frequent derived variant, is influenced by mean minimum temperature of the coldest month  of the year, rather than by mean annual temperature . this may point towards a combined and more complex effect of various aspects of ambient temperature acting on diverse mtoxphos genes of single hares in a co-adaptive way. the significant effect of geographical longitude on the occurrence of the nd <dig> protein variants might indicate a climate aspect related to the distance from the seabord, such as seasonal humidity, that was, however, not investigated in our current analysis.

finally and most notably, we obtained a significant coevolution signal for the two loci under study and detected diversifying  selection on the composite haplotype combining the ancestral atp <dig> protein and the most frequent derived nd <dig> protein and the composite haplotype combining the most frequent derived atp <dig> protein and the ancestral nd <dig> protein. these two protein combinations were found in  <dig> % of all studied hares but did not occur in the sahara region of our study, because the most prevalent derived nd <dig> protein occurred only in the semiarid central tunisian and the mediterranean north tunisian regions. the predominant occurrence of the most prevalent derived b protein at this locus in central tunisia may suggest recent evolution there or recent immigration from western ranges  into central tunisia. nevertheless, the favoured co-occurrence of either the ancestral atp <dig> and the most prevalent derived nd <dig> proteins or the most prevalent derived atp <dig> and the ancestral nd <dig> proteins—hence, the favoured occurrence of either composite haplotype—independent from geographical coordinates of sample locations and independent of climate factors can be interpreted as positive selection favouring either of the two composite haplotypes. that latter finding, together with the significant variation of protein frequencies across the three climate provinces in tunisia, as well as the significant effects of mean annual temperature on atp <dig> protein occurrence and mean minimum temperature of the coldest month of the year on nd <dig> protein occurrence independent from geographical location strongly suggests that the observed sequence patterns at the two loci are indeed due to positive selection, rather than to relaxation of selective constraints as e.g. discussed by .

remarkably, the currently detected sites proved to be under positive selection and being affected by ambient temperature were not found to be under positive selection by  <cit> , who tested for positive selection signals in entire mitogenomes of eleven lepus species, which was probably due to their small number of haplotypes . a total of  <dig> mitogenome mutations are responsible for or associated with different diseases in humans . for atp <dig>   <dig> mutations are associated with twenty different diseases in humans; all these mutations represent single nucleotide substitution, except for the occurrence of one deletion. for instance, the mutation a8836g changes methionine to valine and is associated with the lhon  disease. noteably, the position  <dig> at the atp <dig> locus in our study that is under positive selection represents such a mutation  resulting in the same amino acid change from methionine to valine. for nd <dig>   <dig> mutations are reported to be associated with a total of  <dig> different human diseases; except for two frame shift mutations, all are single nucleotide substitution.

in spite of no immediate functional information on the presently found atp <dig> and nd <dig> protein polymorphisms, their adaptive significance is suggested by 1) the general role of the proteins in the oxphos process of cellular energy and heat production, 2) the varying distribution of the proteins across the different climate zones of our study region, and 3) the effects of ambient temperature on the occurrence of the protein variants. remarkably, the observed ambient temperature effects on the occurrence of the two most frequent protein variants at each locus are independent of geographic sampling localities. this suggests direct involvement of ambient temperature in the selection of these proteins, rather than potential historic population genetic reasons. our finding that the currently revealed most prevalent atp <dig> protein variants are affected by mean annual temperature and the occurrence of the most prevalent nd <dig> protein variants in our study are affected by mean minimum temperature of the coldest month of the year may suggest a combined selective effect of even more  ambient temperature characteristics in a more complex way on the cellular energy production . selection coefficients of protein variants of other mt or nuclear oxphos genes may vary with temperature  characteristics currently not studied, and their likely coevolution to optimize the oxphos process in relation to climatic variation is far from being understood.

in brown hares , a species phylogenetically closely related to the currently studied cape hares or even conspecific with them  <cit> , particularly leverets and young during their early period of growth are supposed to exhibit increased mortality under low ambient temperature, rainy and windy weather, in addition to other factors . high energy costs of young hares for thermoregulation during their early period of growth were pointed out by  <cit> . selection on different mt or noxphos genes may vary in the course of the onthogenetic development or across different climatic regions, particularly under additional ecological circumstances, such as infection with diverse parasites or pathogens that increase energy demands for the immune reaction. therefore, positive selection on spatiotemporally varying combinations of genes is conceivable within one and the same species operating during critical phases of the ontogeny or under varying ecological/climatic environments. as demonstrated by  <cit>  resting metabolic rate of hares  from the negev desert of israel had a resting metabolic rate of only 61% of brown hares from south france. the latter are currently classified as l. europaeus. similar physiological analyses are to date not available for the currently studied hares, but similar climatic characteristics as for the hares from the negev desert on the one hand and in south france on the other may suggest similarly strong physiological adaptations in hares from the different climate zones of tunisia. ideally, experimental  assession of selection on various mtoxphos genes and concomitant determination of physiological parameters such as resting or field metabolic rates of hares with different mtoxphos proteins should complement our current results.

CONCLUSIONS
several evidences obtained in the current study strongly suggest an adaptive significance of the amino acid changes in both the atp <dig> and the nd <dig> loci: 1) the important role of the proteins in cellular metabolism and cellular energy and heat production 2) the significantly varying distribution of the proteins across the different climate zones of our study region, despite little geographical differentiation in non-coding d-loop sequences of the same mitogenomes; 3) the significant signals of positive selection on those sites that translate into the most prevalent proteins at both loci; and 4) the significant effects of ambient temperature  on the occurrence of the protein variants. this might suggest strong physiological adaptations  in hares from the different climate zones of tunisia. however, experimental assession of selection on various mtoxphos genes and concomitant determination of physiological parameters is necessary to complement our current results.
