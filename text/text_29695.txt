BACKGROUND
life exists amid an electromagnetic background and it is therefore not surprising that biological systems are finely tuned to detect and react to static magnetic fields  of various strengths. in a well known example from nature, the migration of birds is guided by very low strength geomagnetic fields  <cit> . in humans, there are intriguing reports – exemplified by an anecdotal harvard study that showed severely depressed manic depressive patients experienced dramatic mood swings towards happiness during mri  <cit>  and pilot pain management clinical trials  <cit>  – that magnetic fields can benefit health. in more rigorously controlled animal studies, beneficial effects on pain reduction  <cit> , hypertension  <cit> , wound healing  <cit> , inflammation  <cit> , and microvascular circulation  <cit>  have been reported. to facilitate the translation of these early results to efficacious therapeutic modalities, a greater understanding of the underlying biological basis of magnetic exposure is required  <cit> . accordingly, in this paper we take steps towards bridging the gap between the established biophysical effects of magnetic fields on sub-cellular macromolecular components and reported tissue-level and whole organism responses by exploring whether smf can function as a novel stimulus for signaling pathways at the cell level.

the premise that smf can modulate signaling networks is based on reports that establish lipid bilayers as the most compelling molecular biosensors capable of responding to magnetic exposure. specifically, moderate strength smf can change biophysical properties of membranes that include hyperpolarization  <cit> , redox potential  <cit> , and fluidity  <cit>  thereby altering flux through sodium   <cit>  and calcium   <cit>  channels. as a result, changes in cytosolic concentrations of the calcium ion – which serves as a second messenger in several signaling pathways – occurs ubiquitously in cells exposed to smf  <cit> . in addition to altering ion channel flux, biophysical changes to membranes may also affect lipid raft microdomains in ways that modulate downstream signaling; an example of this phenomenon is the impact of ethanol on lipid rafts and the concomitant changes to toll like receptor  <dig>  activity  <cit> . in contrast to ethanol – which increases membrane domain fluidity – smf exposure increases membrane rigidity, an effect that has been coupled to the promotion of differentiation in osteoblast-like cells  <cit> .

in the first part this study, mrna profiling of smf-treated cells coupled with analysis of the microarray data by the ingenuity pathway analysis software tool  <cit>  verified that anticipated transcriptional changes – qualitatively consistent with the impact of altered ca2+ flux or membrane domain fluidity on signaling pathways – did occur. building on this finding, we conducted a detailed molecular and biochemical characterization of cellular elements linked to interleukin- <dig>  in human embryonic cells. as a framework for the ensuing experiments described in this study, these connections are diagrammed in figure 1; this figure shows both known connections between il- <dig> and other molecular players  as well previously unappreciated links . this study concludes by showing that smf leads towards oligodendrocyte differentiation in human embryonic cells by preferentially stimulating pre-oligodendrocyte markers over the astrocyte markers usually associated with il- <dig> exposure. together, these results establish smf as an intriguing means to ultimately  stimulate cells in an endogenous niche.

RESULTS
transcriptional profiling and ingenuity pathway software analysis
to gain evidence for the hypothesis that smf exposure activates or otherwise modulates signaling networks, human embryoid body derived  cells  <cit>  were exposed to  <dig> – <dig>  t fields and mrna microarray profiling was used to determine changes to global patterns of gene expression. in the first tests,  <dig> min smf exposure  was tested based on reports that gene expression responded to magnetic exposure this quickly  <cit> . in our evaluation, however, only two genes were up- and down-regulated with a statistical probability > 95%  and none met the common benchmark of a 2-  fold change. nonetheless, the reproducibility over multiple probes for the same gene indicated that these modest changes were real and provided impetus to investigate longer term exposure.

indeed, after one day  of smf treatment,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated with statistical significance ; even greater changes were seen after  <dig> or  <dig> days of exposure. the magnitude of the change for most genes, however, was modest  with only  <dig> showing up-regulation ≥ 2-fold  and  <dig> showing a similar degree of down-regulation . after  <dig> days of continuous smf exposure, the number of genes up-regulated by ≥ 2-fold increased to  <dig>  while  <dig> were down-regulated to a similar extent. interestingly, in an experiment where the cells were allowed to recover for one day under normal culture conditions after prolonged smf exposure, the number of genes that remained up-regulated by ≥ 2-fold fell by almost half  whereas the number of down-regulated genes increased by  <dig> .

the microarray results were consistent with the activation of signal transduction pathways over the short term  leading to an amplified set of genetic changes over the next several days. a simple inspection of transcriptional changes  did not lead to any obvious insights into the over-riding effects of smf however. therefore, to flesh out this hypothesis, the ingenuity pathway analysis software tool  <cit>  was used to analyze the microarray data resulting in the identification of nine networks that responded to smf exposure in hedb lved cells . several of these pathways reflected known biological responses to magnetic exposure. for example, changes to intracellular ca2+ pools observed in cell lines exposed to smf  <cit>  were consistent with interleukin- <dig>  centered signaling responses  mediated through the ability of this cytokine to be modulated by ca2+ flux  <cit> . similarly, wnt responses  can be activated by a non-canonical ca2+ dependent mechanism  <cit> . moving above the cell level, two networks were identified  that related to cardiovascular development and hematological function, respectively, and thus dovetail with a recent report by morris and skalak where smf exposure of  <dig> – <dig>  t for a comparable time period  facilitated micro-vessel regeneration after surgical intervention  <cit> . likewise, strieth and coauthors have reported that smf affects the vascular and blood flow  <cit>  and okano and coworkers have investigated the modulation of blood vessels by magnetic fields  <cit> .

smf increased il- <dig> mrna levels and protein secretion at early time points
even though the software analysis of the microarray data was consistent with a mechanism wherein smf acted as a stimulus for signaling pathways, limitations of this methodology precluded any firm conclusions. signaling pathway responses, for example, are typically measured over time intervals of minutes to hours and require evaluation with closely-spaced time points not practical by microarray profiling over several days. therefore, to verify that the transcriptional changes we observed represented legitimate responses to smf, we selected il- <dig> for conventional biochemical characterization. of the nine networks identified by microarray profiling, the selection of il- <dig> for additional scrutiny was based on several factors. first, a recent report linked  <dig>  t smf exposure to increased il- <dig> production in fibroblasts  <cit>  and plausible membrane-based modes of activation il- <dig>  exist. furthermore, reports that smf can promote differentiation  <cit>  – coupled with the propensity of the hebd lvec line used in this study to display neural markers  <cit>  together with reports that il- <dig> promotes astrocytogenesis  <cit>  – offered the possibility that cell-level responses  could be observed in these experiments.

biochemical validation began by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  analysis of il- <dig> mrna levels over the first  <dig> h of smf exposure, a time frame selected based on the numerous changes seen in the microarray data after one day  and literature reports of biphasic il- <dig> activation during this time period  <cit> . in these experiments, il- <dig> mrna levels increased two hours into smf exposure and remained elevated compared to untreated control cells at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h . il- <dig> secretion into the culture medium followed slower kinetics, first showing a measurable increase at  <dig> h after which smf-treated cells out-produced control cells up to  <dig> h . the smf-exposed cells experienced the largest relative increase compared to untreated controls at  <dig> h, followed by a decline to slightly less than control levels at the end of the six day monitoring period.

tlr <dig> was activated by smf in tandem with il-6
upon verifying that il- <dig> was activated by smf at both the mrna and protein levels, we sought more detailed insight into this response. as indicated in figure 1a &1b , il- <dig> activation was consistent with the known ability of magnetic fields to alter calcium ion channel flux and reports of ca2+-dependent up-regulation of il- <dig> . in addition, connections il- <dig> shares with tlr <dig>  <cit> , combined with the dependence of the signaling activity of toll-like receptors on their lateral diffusion within membrane microdomains  <cit> , suggested a parallel route through which smf could influence il- <dig>  specifically, a sequence of events can be postulated where smf changes membrane fluidity thereby modulating tlr <dig>  and downstream il- <dig> responses  through a ca2+-dependent mechanism  or through tlr4-mediated p <dig> phosphorylation .

experimentally, because tlr <dig> transcription is strictly auto-regulated in a stimulus-dependent manner , qrt-pcr can be used to monitor its activation. by monitoring this endpoint, we found that tlr <dig> transcript levels increased during the first several hours of smf exposure . interestingly, self-activation of tlr <dig> can lead to either the down-regulation of its mrna  or to up-regulation ; the current up-regulation of tlr <dig> mrna observed in smf-treated embryonic cells is consistent with results obtained in other types of human cells upon activation of tlrs.

smf activation of tlr <dig> impinges upon mapk pathways
the activation of il- <dig> in cells exposed to smf was consistent with signal transduction through the upstream involvement of tlr <dig> . to gain biochemical evidence for this connection, we analyzed the phosphorylation of p <dig>  which lies in the pathway that connects tlr <dig> with il- <dig>  and found the predicted increase in phosphorylated p <dig> in smf treated cells . this result, in addition to establishing a connection between il- <dig> and smf through tlr <dig>  provided evidence that smf impinges on mapk signaling  prompting us to evaluate changes to proliferation and apoptosis. in these experiments a significant reduction in proliferation was seen for hebd lvec cells after three days of smf exposure; this effect lessened by the sixth day and was lost by the ninth day . qualitatively, this short term change in proliferation was consistent with studies where smf transiently altered proliferation  <cit> . annexin/propidium iodide staining assays showed that reduced proliferation during early phases of smf exposure was not a consequence of increased apoptosis  in agreement with reports that smf, if anything, is protective against apoptosis  <cit> . having ruled out that the smf treated cells were dying, a plausible explanation for the reduced proliferation was that the cells were undergoing differentiation with a concomitant decrease in their growth rate; this possibility was supported by data presented later in this report.

smf responses are cell line dependent
as a brief diversion from the main thrust of this study, which was to connect smf with cellular responses associated with il- <dig> in human embryonic cells, we wish to emphasize that the impact of smf on other common laboratory cells such as the jurkat, hela, and hek ad <dig> lines was surveyed and "obvious" effects such as pronounced changes in proliferation  or altered morphology  were not observed. for example, representative data is shown for the hek ad <dig> line in figure  <dig> where control and smf-exposed cells had identical growth rates when measured by either the mtt assay  or through cell counting . the clear-cut differences seen between the embryonic hebd lvec line and cancer lines were not surprising based on reports that even closely-matched cell lines respond uniquely to smf  <cit> ; instead these findings support the hypothesis that changes to ca2+ flux  – a parameter that is highly cell line dependent  <cit>  – contributes to the cellular responses we observed in the cells exposed to smf.

connections between gangliosides and il- <dig> exist in hebd lvec cells
to gain insight into whether regulatory networks beyond tlr <dig> or calcium flux contributed to the up-regulation of il- <dig> in smf treated cells, we next focused on gangliosides  <cit> . gangliosides are sialic acid-bearing glycosphingolipids  that are integral components of lipid rafts and caveolae of the type surrounding tlr <dig> that not only organize these microdomains but also regulate the signaling functions of embedded proteins . consequently, tlr <dig>  <cit>  and il- <dig>  <cit>  can be influenced by the equilibrium between the 'inert'  gsl lactosylceramide  and the suppressive ganglioside gm <dig> .

before beginning experiments to probe the impact of smf exposure on gangliosides, the relationship between gm <dig>  and il- <dig> was first investigated to establish a baseline for the hebd lvec line . a long-lasting and substantial  reduction in il- <dig> mrna was observed in cells incubated with exogenously-added gm <dig> or gd <dig> . crosstalk between gangliosides and il- <dig> also held in the reverse direction as demonstrated by a dose dependent decrease in gm <dig> in cells incubated with exogenously-added il- <dig> . by reducing the amount of gm <dig> present in a cell , il- <dig> can alleviate the suppressive effects of this ganglioside on its transcription  thus setting up a 'feed-forward' loop that offers an mechanistic explanation for the self-activation of il- <dig> described in the literature  <cit>  and demonstrated for hebd lvec cells in this study . figure 6c shows that levels of tlr <dig> mrna also increased significantly in il- <dig> supplemented cells consistent with the removal of concomitant inhibitory effects of gm <dig> on tlr <dig>  <cit> . together with the impact of smf on il- <dig> shown in figure  <dig>  these results demonstrate that smf has the capacity for tuning il- <dig> signaling by adjusting the relative proportions of the 'active' ganglioside gm <dig> and its 'inert' asialo counterpart laccer  thereby contributing to the transcriptional up-regulation of tlr <dig> and il- <dig> .

il- <dig> mediated changes to gm <dig> and gd <dig> occur via neu <dig> and stgal5
mechanistically, changes to one of two enzymes could explain the shift in equilibrium away from the suppressive ganglioside gm <dig> to its inert asialo counterpart laccer ; specifically, an increase in the recycling enzyme neu <dig> or a decrease in the biosynthetic enzyme st3gal <dig> . despite no previously-known direct links between il- <dig> and st3gal <dig> or neu <dig>  increased phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> has been connected with the up-regulation of stgal <dig> . therefore, based on a report linking il- <dig> and mapk signaling through jak/stat that involved erk1/ <dig>   <cit> , we reasoned that erk1/ <dig> could serve as an intermediary to connect il- <dig> with st3gal <dig> expression. accordingly, we tested the phosphorylation of erk  and found that perk1/ <dig> was inhibited by concentrations of il- <dig> >  <dig>  ng/ml ; the reduced ratio of perk1/ <dig> to erk was consistent with dampened mrna levels for the biosynthetic enzyme st3gal <dig> and the tandem up-regulation of the recycling enzyme neu <dig> . a noteworthy aspect of this study was that, although the effects of neu <dig> and st3gal <dig> on "lubricating signaling pathways"  <cit>  have been previously evaluated separately, to our knowledge this is the first report where both enzymes were monitored simultaneously and found to respond to an external stimulus in a concerted manner that required transcriptional regulation of the biosynthetic and recycling enzymes in opposite directions.

the prolonged down-regulation of ganglioside gm <dig> upon il- <dig> supplementation  provides a two-pronged mechanistic explanation for long term attenuation of il- <dig> and related responses in smf-treated cells  followed by loss of growth inhibition by day  <dig> ). first, the loss of sialic acid – an important contributor to the carbohydrate-carbohydrate binding interactions that stabilize lipid assemblies  <cit>  – from gm <dig> can destabilize cd82-enriched microdomains  <cit> . assuming that the tlr <dig> receptor complex, which is also sensitive to the stability of its local microdomain environment  <cit> , responds to a reduction in gm <dig> levels in a similar manner, the signaling pathways activated by smf over the first day or so of exposure could be 'turned off' by the loss of gm <dig> over longer time periods. a second mechanism to explain ganglioside-mediated attenuation of il- <dig> can be postulated based on the findings by müthing and colleagues that gsl such as gm <dig> increase ca2+ flux through voltage gated channels  <cit> . in an independent set of experiments, yang and coworkers reported a strongly stimulatory effect for gm <dig> on the sr ca2+-atpase  <cit> . together, these findings indicate that the conversion of gm <dig> to laccer in smf-treated cells inhibits ca2+-dependent signaling pathways in a manner that attenuates the initial multi-pronged up-regulation of il- <dig> 

smf regulates ganglioside production via neu <dig> and st3gal5
the crosstalk between gangliosides and il- <dig> , combined with the ability of smf to modulate this cytokine , led us to consider whether smf altered il- <dig> via a ganglioside-mediated route . to investigate this possibility, neu <dig> and st3gal <dig> – the enzymes that control the equilibrium between gm <dig> and laccer  and thus have the potential to indirectly modulate il- <dig>  – were monitored by qrt-pcr during the early stages of smf exposure. in these experiments, up-regulation of neu <dig> and inhibition of st3gal <dig> after one day of smf exposure  reminiscent of the effects of il- <dig> supplementation  were observed. analysis of ganglioside levels in these cells showed that these transcriptional changes again worked in concert to decrease gm <dig> levels on the cell surface . a similar reduction in gm <dig> occurred in fixed and permeabilized cells where gangliosides situated in the secretory pathway are also measured . by testing both conditions, the possibility that surface changes merely reflected the redistribution of gm <dig> between the cell surface and intracellular compartments was discounted . interestingly, gd <dig> – which can modulate the biophysical properties of membrane raft assemblies similar to gm <dig>  – was also reduced by smf ; this result can be explained by the ability of neu <dig> to remove both sialic acid residues of gd <dig> 

smf regulates neu <dig> and st3gal <dig> independently of il-6
in order to gain insight into the cause and effect relationships that connect smf, gangliosides, and il- <dig>  il- <dig> was added to cells in the presence or absence of smf. in this experiment il- <dig> had the same effect on gm <dig> levels with or without concomitant magnetic exposure . this result contrasted with the clear reduction in gm <dig> when il- <dig> had been added to cells in the absence of smf . one explanation for these disparate results was that smf activated a sequence of events where il- <dig> transcription was first up-regulated leading to increased protein secretion, which in turn reduced gm <dig>  this scenario, however, was discounted by a time course of neu <dig> and st3gal <dig> mrna expression over the first day of smf exposure  that showed that the transcriptional changes to these enzymes occurred before measurable il- <dig> secretion took place . therefore, smf independently regulates il- <dig> and gangliosides in a way that ultimately impinges on the same molecular mechanism . gm <dig> and gd <dig> also provide a putative explanation for the biphasic increase in il- <dig> mrna; at early time points a ganglioside-independent sequence of events  occurs. as the initial signal fades, reduction of gm <dig> and gd <dig> could contribute to a second 'burst' of il- <dig> expression by alleviating the suppressive effects of these gangliosides on il- <dig> itself  or on tlr <dig> .

smf – in combination with il- <dig> – alters cell morphology
as described earlier, hebd lvec cells exposed to smf experienced reduced proliferation without toxicity , a response consistent with differentiation. to test if this phenomenon was linked to smf or il- <dig> production, cells were first treated with ≤  <dig>  ng/ml of il- <dig> in the absence of smf. il- <dig> supplementation typically resulted in relatively minor  change to cell morphology . occasionally, however, dendrite-like outgrowths reminiscent of neuronal cells developed in sub-populations of il- <dig> treated cells . by contrast, close to 100% of the cells attained distinctive morphology when smf was combined with  <dig>  ng/ml of il- <dig> .

one explanation for why both smf and exogenous il- <dig> supplementation was needed to elicit noticeable changes to cell morphology was that, because of the relatively small volume of cells  compared to culture medium, any il- <dig> secreted in response to smf would be diluted ~ <dig> -fold. as a consequence, additional il- <dig> supplementation was required to mimic levels achieved by comparable rates of il- <dig> production in cells situated within an in vivo niche where the relative cell to interstitial volume ratios are much lower. another  explanation, supported by experiments where even  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig> could not reproduce the combined effects of smf plus  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig> , was that smf-activated networks beyond il- <dig> – such as those listed in table  <dig> – contributed to the morphological changes.

smf promotes oligodendrocyte progenitor markers
to gain greater insight into the morphological changes induced in hebd lved cells by a combination of smf and il- <dig>  we noted that il- <dig> has a role in the regeneration of nervous tissue, usually promoting astrocyte formation  <cit>  and, accordingly, monitored the transcription of bone morphogenic protein  <dig>  and myelin basic protein  . interestingly, a decrease in mrna for bmp- <dig>  a protein that stimulates astrocytogenesis  <cit> , was observed suggesting that the hebd cells were not differentiating into astrocytes as expected. to confirm this observation using immunofluorescent microscopy, no increase in the gfap marker associated with astrocyte formation was observed in smf and il- <dig> treated cells . similarly, no increase was seen for nef , a marker associated with neuron differentiation.

based on the lack of astrocyte or neuron differentiation, a third possibility was that the decrease in bmp- <dig> expression in smf-treated cells removed the obstacle presented by bone morphogenetic proteins towards differentiation to oligodendrocyte lineages  <cit> . indeed, consistent with the decrease in bmp- <dig>  an increase in myelin basic protein  transcription was observed  providing a biochemical marker consistent with differentiation to an oligodendrocytes  <cit> . additional supporting evidence that smf, combined with il- <dig>  leads toward oligodendrocyte progenitor formation was provided by the increased expression of vimentim  and gal-c .

a timeline of smf responses: towards unraveling cause and effect relationships
the relationships between smf, calcium, tlr <dig>  gangliosides , mapk pathway elements  and il- <dig> are outlined in figure 1; this diagram, however, does not provide a dynamic view that would provide insight into cause and effect relationships. therefore, to summarize the time dependence of various aspects of hebd lvec cell responses to smf exposure, early, intermediate, and longer term responses are summarized in figure  <dig>  during the first four hours , changes to calcium flux occur within minutes as do mapk responses ; effects on the transcription of il- <dig>  tlr <dig>  neu <dig>  and st3gal <dig> mrna lag slightly but show a strong response beginning between  <dig> and  <dig> hours. by contrast, secreted il- <dig> remains unchanged. during the remainder of the first day of exposure , mrna levels of smf treated cells trend back to control levels . also during the first day, while the impact of smf on transcription of il- <dig>  tlr <dig>  neu <dig>  and st3gal <dig> abates, phenotypic effects such as the accumulation of measurable levels of secreted il- <dig> began to be manifest. in general, initiating events – for example, the impact of smf on mrna levels – were attenuated after the second day  whereas "behavioral" responses  followed the same trend but lagged in time. during this multiday time period – while "intermediate" responses were returning to normal – long-lived changes to cell fate arose that included the morphological changes shown in figure  <dig> and the accumulation of pre-oligodendrocyte markers shown in figure  <dig> 

another lesson learned from the data shown in figure  <dig> was that smf treatment set in motion a complex sequence of events that rapidly changed over time; consequently, the original goal of analyzing cellular responses by microarray profiling could have led to erroneous conclusions. for example, the complex and rapidly changing nature of il- <dig> mrna transcription could have led to the conclusion that the microarray results were simply irreproducible, as has been reported for much lower-strength fields  <cit> . alternately, the four and five day time points – where il- <dig> mrna levels were actually lower than controls – were not consistent with the strong, multifaceted up-regulation that occurred upon the initial exposure to magnetic stimulus thereby also providing misleading information if regarded in isolation. therefore, we close by noting the benefits of the robust ability of software tools to uncover signature biological activity – namely, signaling responses associated with il- <dig> – even when the key molecular player  is undergoing rapidly changing or oscillatory behavior that would be difficult to understand by itself.

CONCLUSIONS
at the outset, we emphasize that this study was not intended to provide a comprehensive account of the cellular effects of smf. for example, mechanisms other than those based on a lipid biolayer 'biosensor' may contribute to the transcriptional changes observed in this study as direct effects of smf on protein-dna interactions have been postulated  <cit>  as have changes in enzymatic and biochemical reactions  <cit> . therefore, we reiterate that our goal was to provide a rudimentary framework of one of many parallel or complementary mechanisms through which magnetic stimuli are transduced from molecular level biosensors into cell-level responses. this objective was pursued by mrna microarray profiling that verified time-dependent global changes in transcription occurred that were consistent with the activation of signaling pathways. then, to gain insight into the specific networks affected by smf exposure, which were not obvious by simple inspection of the genes involved, the microarray data was subject to software analysis and signaling networks consistent with tissue- or organ-level responses to magnetic exposure  were identified.

although the microarray data identified cellular responses consistent with previously reported biological responses to magnetic exposure, we nonetheless sought to ensure that these associations were not just coincidental or an artefact of the software analysis. detailed biochemical investigation of all nine pathways  was well beyond the scope of a single study, therefore we selected a single network – il- <dig> signaling – for validation and outlined several molecular paths  that accounted for the multifaceted up-regulation of il- <dig> by smf that occurred over the first  <dig> to  <dig> days of exposure. from the standpoint of disease intervention, the up-regulation of il- <dig> by smf at first seems to be unwanted because il- <dig> is generally maintained at low levels in healthy tissue  <cit> . moreover, chronically elevated levels of il- <dig> are usually deleterious . in some cases, however, the short-term activation of il- <dig> can be therapeutically beneficial; for example, this pleiotropic cytokine can be neuroprotective immediately after injury  <cit> . consequently, successful therapeutic intervention involving il- <dig> is contingent upon transient – as experienced in the smf-treated cells – rather than on prolonged activation to avoid the deleterious consequences of chronic inflammation and other long term consequences of sustained il- <dig> production.

in a final set of experiments, we briefly investigated whether smf-mediated responses associated with il- <dig> signaling translated into changes in phenotype observable at the whole cell level. although il- <dig> impacts numerous cell-level and systemic responses, our experimental efforts were focused by reports that il- <dig> guides differentiation of neural stem cells primarily to astrocytes  <cit> . these clues led us to investigate whether evidence of astrocytogenesis was seen in the hebd lvec cells, an embryonic line that is predisposed to neural differentiation  <cit> . interestingly, responses consistent with differentiation  were not reflected in the biochemical markers indicative of the astrocyte differentiation expected from il- <dig>  instead, markers found in oligodendrocyte precursor cells were manifest, indicating that the other pathways modulated by smf tuned the 'usual' activity of il- <dig>  ultimately, if full oligodendrocyte formation can be promoted in vivo by smf without concomitant astrocyte enhancement , this capability could lead to non-invasive therapies for conditions such a multiple sclerosis  linked to oligodendrocyte pathologies.
