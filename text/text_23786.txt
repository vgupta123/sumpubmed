BACKGROUND
ctl and nk cells play an essential role in the host defence against intracellular microbial pathogens like listeria monocytogenes  <cit>  or mycobacteria tuberculosis  <cit> . several mechanisms are involved in clearance of intracellular bacteria including cytokine release  <cit> , apoptosis induction of the host cell  <cit> , and directly executed antimicrobial activity of ctl. the direct antibacterial activity of ctl is mediated by granulysin  <cit> , a  <dig> kda protein discovered by subtractive hybridization of late activated t-cells  <cit> . recombinant granulysin proved to exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi and parasites  <cit> . we recently demonstrated that granulysin enters human dc in a lipid raft-associated mechanism and gains access to l. innocua located in phagosomes to induce bacteriolysis  <cit> . however, intracellular bacteria were never fully eradicated by treatment of the dc with granulysin only. as granulysin is stored in granules of ctl together with other lytic proteins such as perforin, the interaction of both proteins in killing intracellular bacteria is of great interest. perforin shares homology with the terminal complement components and can thus multimerize in eukaryotic membranes to form pores of a diameter of  <dig> nm or less. these perforin pores were initially thought to allow passage of lytic granule components, especially granzymes, to the target cell cytosol  <cit> . the discovery of granzyme b to be endocytosed independently of perforin as well as the induction of target cell apoptosis by granzyme b and perforin without detectable leakage of the plasma membrane questioned the pore formation model  <cit> . in contrary, keefe et al. demonstrated a transient ca2+ flux in hela cells in response to sublytic perforin concentrations indicating short-lived membrane pores that are immediately repaired by the cellular wound healing system  <cit> .

the role of perforin in granulysin-mediated intracellular bacteriolysis is contradictory. stenger et al. demonstrated that perforin was necessary for granulysin-mediated killing of intracellular m. tuberculosis in macrophages  <cit> . on the other hand, cell based in vitro-studies showed that killing of intracellular mycobacteria by cd4+ and cd8+ cytotoxic t cells occurred independently of perforin  <cit> . the role of perforin in delivering granulysin was further questioned in a study using m. leprae also residing within phagosomes of host cells. ochoa et al. demonstrated by phenotyping cells in dermal granuloma of leprosy lesions that the majority of cells containing granulysin were cd4+ and cd3+, but negative for perforin  <cit> .

using our proven model system, we investigated the interaction of perforin and granulysin in human monocyte-derived dc as hosts harbouring l. innocua, a gram positive, apathogenic bacterium ubiquitously distributed in our environment  <cit> . influence of perforin on granulysin binding, uptake and trafficking was visualized and quantified as well as correlated to the lysis of intracellular l. innocua. it was further examined if stable plasma membrane pore formation and/or short lived changes in the plasma membrane integrity allowing transient ca2+ fluxes is a prerequisite for the mediation of the perforin effect.

RESULTS
perforin enhances significantly granulysin-mediated lysis of l. innocua in dc
in a previous study we showed that about 40% of l. innocua located intracellular in human dc were killed by granulysin  <cit> . as granulysin is stored in cytolytic granules together with perforin, we evaluated the influence of simultaneously applied perforin in granulysin-induced bacteriolysis in human dc. treatment of l. innocua-challenged dc with various concentrations of granulysin and a constant perforin-concentration of  <dig>  ku/ml for  <dig> hours at 37°c reduced the viability of the intracellular bacteria dose-dependently as tested in colony forming unit  assays . at a granulysin-concentration of  <dig>  μm together with  <dig>  ku/ml perforin more than 75% of the intracellular listeria were lysed. furthermore, perforin significantly enhanced intracellular bacteriolysis at granulysin concentrations of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  and  <dig> μm . when infected dc were treated with granulysin +/- perforin at 4°c or with actinfrag +/- perforin no killing of intracellular bacteria was observed .

in order to exclude bacterial loss due to detachment of perishing host cells, the viability of listeria-challenged dc during incubation with granulysin alone or in combination with perforin was assessed in ldh release assays. granulysin in all tested concentrations did not cause a significant ldh release from dc . incubation of granulysin  with perforin  resulted in dc lysis of less than 2% . therefore,  <dig>  μm granulysin and  <dig>  ku/ml perforin were considered to be sublytic to host cells and were used in all subsequent experiments. perforin incubated alone in concentrations up to  <dig> ku/ml was found to have no lytic activity on listeria-challenged dc . this result further indicates that perforin in the concentrations applied does not lead to an increase in membrane permeability sufficient for a detectable release of ldh from treated dc.

l. innocua in suspension treated with granulysin showed dose-dependently a decrease in viability as calculated from bacterial growth curves. at granulysin concentrations down to  <dig>  μm more than 90% of the bacteria were killed . the median effective dose was determined in the concentration range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm. below  <dig>  μm killing activity decreased to background level. unlike to the killing efficiency of intracellular l. innocua, simultaneous perforin application at a concentration of  <dig>  ku/ml did not further decrease bacteriaviability in suspension. furthermore, perforin applied alone in concentrations up to  <dig> ku/ml did not affect listeria viability .

taken together, granulysin-mediated lysis of intracellular l. innocua in human dc is significantly enhanced by perforin.

granulysin and perforin can be sequentially added to induce enhanced intracellular bacteriolysis
using pulse-chase experiments, we evaluated whether granulysin and perforin must be simultaneously present or can be sequentially added for enhanced intracellular bacteriolysis. for this purpose dc were first pulsed with  <dig>  μm granulysin for  <dig> minutes at 4°c and, after medium replacement, further incubated at 37°c to allow endocytosis of granulysin. at indicated time points during the chase period, dc were treated with perforin at a concentration of  <dig>  ku/ml at 37°c for an overall experimental duration of  <dig> minutes. when perforin treatment followed immediately or up to  <dig> minutes after the granulysin pulse, a significant increase of bacteriolysis was detected as compared to samples incubated without perforin . perforin application  <dig> minutes after pulsing the dc with granulysin did not lead to a significant enhancement of intracellular bacteriolysis, even with prolonged experimental duration to obtain a perforin incubation time  <dig> minutes . likewise, first pretreating with perforin for  <dig> minutes at 37°c before medium replacement and subsequently incubating with granulysin for  <dig> minutes did not significantly enhance intracellular bacteriolysis .

sublytic perforin does not result in stable plasma membrane pores
perforin was described to induce pore formation in eukaryotic cell membranes  <cit> . therefore, we investigated the pore forming capability of perforin on l. innocua-challenged human dc using ldh release assays . since ldh is a rather large molecule  that might not diffuse by passive efflux through transient perforin pores we chose a detection system using the cell-impermeant nucleic acid stain ethidium homodimer- <dig> . perforin in a concentration of  <dig>  ku/ml used for granulysin-mediated bacteriolysis caused no raise in membrane permeability for ethd- <dig> in listeria-challenged dc . just a moderate increase in ethd- <dig> positive dc up to 14% was detected at a perforin concentration of  <dig>  ku/ml. as listeria-challenged dc demonstrated to be rather refractory to perforin lysis, we also tested the susceptibility of unchallenged dc to perforin lysis. we found significant lysis of unchallenged dc already at a perforin concentration of  <dig>  ku/ml  which dose dependently increased up to  <dig> % at a concentration of  <dig>  ku/ml. to demonstrate the quality of the perforin preparation, the hemolytic activity was always tested in parallel experiments . these results clearly indicate that listeria challenge of dc alters their susceptibility to perforin lysis.

stable perforin membrane pores could be excluded to be a major factor for the enhancement effect in granulysin-mediated bacteriolysis.

sublytic perforin induces a transient ca2+ influx
the existence of short-lived changes of the plasma membrane integrity still could not be excluded, since passive diffusion of ethd- <dig> might not be fast enough for intracellular accumulation of detectable levels of the dye. as perforin was shown to trigger a transient ca2+ flux in hela cells  <cit> , intracellular ca2+ in response to perforin and/or granulysin was assessed in dc. for this purpose listeria-challenged dc were loaded with the ca2+ sensitive dye fura- <dig> before treatment with perforin and/or granulysin. the application of  <dig>  ku/ml perforin on dc resulted in an immediate and transient rise of the intracellular ca2+ concentration which recovered completely within the next  <dig> minutes . the intensity of the response varied among the cells but an increase of the intracellular ca2+ concentration was measured in every single cell at the indicated perforin concentration. the transient ca2+ flux did not disturb critically the viability or even the ca2+ homeostasis in the cells as consecutive treatment with atp , which triggers ca2+ release from intracellular sources  <cit> , resulted in the typical biphasic curve of the excitation ratio. granulysin incubated alone at concentrations up to  <dig> μm did not change the intracellular ca2+ level and also simultaneous granulysin and perforin treatment did not increase the response compared to perforin treatment alone .

to investigate the source of the ca2+ responsible for the transient flux, listeria-challenged dc were pretreated with the established intracellular calcium channel blockers tmb- <dig>  and dantrolene   <cit>  prior to the perforin incubation. perforin in a concentration of  <dig>  ku/ml induced a transient ca2+ flux in the pretreated dc . aiming to verify the inhibition of the ca2+ mobilization from intracellular sources, the dc were subsequently treated with atp. in tmb-8/dantrolene-pretreated dc atp did not cause a ca2+ response, in contrast to the ca2+ ionophor ionomycin , which resulted in a ca2+ rise . the effect of perforin in low ca2+ buffer was also tested . for this purpose listeria-challenged dc were equilibrated in a low ca2+  buffer before exposure to perforin, which did not result in a ca2+ response. only after washout and buffer exchange to normal ca2+ conditions , a ca2+ flux could be provoked by perforin. comparable to the ethd- <dig> results above, non listeria-challenged dc were by a factor 5– <dig> more sensitive to perforin triggered ca2+ fluxes .

the ability of granulysin to induce ca2+ fluxes was investigated by incubating granulysin alone at concentrations up to  <dig> μm, which did not change the intracellular ca2+ level. furthermore, simultaneous granulysin and perforin treatment did not increase the response compared to perforin treatment alone . these result provide clear evidence that sublytic perforin triggers a transient ca2+ influx in listeria-challenged dc. finally, the role of the transient ca2+ rise in the granulysin-mediated intracellular bacteriolysis was investigated by the comparison of the enhancing effect of perforin and ionomycin. ionomycin demonstrated a clear tendency to enhance granulysin-mediated bacteriolysis in all tested samples but due to broader distribution of the single values an overall significance was barely not achieved  in contrast to the effect of perforin  . the ca2+ rise induced by ionomycin was furthermore distinguishable from that triggered by perforin as the response was prolonged and the recovery incomplete .

perforin does not influence granulysin binding and initial uptake in dc
to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the enhancing effect of perforin, the impact of perforin on granulysin binding and initial uptake was studied. by confocal laser scanning microscopy a spot like pattern of granulysin was detected in l. innocua-challenged dc which was clearly localized within the cells when incubated at 37°c . after incubation at 4°c, granulysin labeling was found attached to the cell membrane and no significant uptake occurred . a similar staining pattern of binding and initial uptake was detected after granulysin treatment of non-infected dc . no difference in the localization of granulysin or intensity of the staining could be found in cells that were treated with granulysin and perforin  compared to cells that were exposed only to granulysin. when the dc were treated with the his-tagged control protein actinfrag in presence of perforin at 37°c, no bound or internalized protein could be detected demonstrating both the membrane binding properties of granulysin as well as the specificity of the anti-his ab .

to quantify the influence of perforin on granulysin binding and uptake western blot analysis was performed. following an adapted protocol of shi et al.  <cit> , externally bound granulysin was removed by washing with  <dig> mm arginine to quantify the internalized granulysin fraction. after incubation of dc with granulysin at a concentration of  <dig>  μm at 4°c, the arginine washing step removed over 95% of the bound granulysin compared to pbs washing . after incubation at 37°c 44% of the total granulysin signal remained detectable following the arginine incubation and was therefore considered as the internalized fraction . co-incubation of perforin in concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig> ku/ml did not significantly affect the binding of granulysin to dc membranes . granulysin uptake tended to decrease in response to  <dig>  ku/ml perforin but the decline was not statistically significant regarding all independent experiments . a perforin concentration of  <dig> ku/ml significantly reduced granulysin uptake in human dc .

perforin does not affect granulysin transfer to early sorting endosomes
following uptake granulysin is found in early sorting endosomes  <cit> . to evaluate whether perforin affects this step in granulysin trafficking double labeling of a molecule specific for the endocytic compartment  and granulysin was performed. granulysin was found colocalized with eea- <dig> after incubating l. innocua infected dc with granulysin for  <dig> minutes at 37°c in steady-state . simultaneous perforin treatment  did not affect the intensity of granulysin labeling in the eea- <dig> positive organelles . using imaris software colocalization images of eea- <dig> and granulysin were calculated . quantification of these images concerning the granulysin fraction found in the eea- <dig> positive vesicles revealed no significant difference between the dc that were only granulysin treated or those that were granulysin and perforin treated . taken together, these results indicate that perforin does not influence the amount of granulysin residing in early sorting endosomes of dc.

perforin enhances granulysin transfer to listeria-containing phagosomes
granulysin has to gain access to l. innocua located in phagosomes of the dc to successfully mediate intracellular bacteriolysis. in order to study granulysin transfer to phagosomes, l. innocua-challenged dc were treated for the indicated time periods with  <dig>  μm granulysin in presence or absence of  <dig>  ku/ml perforin and stained with the anti-his mab. in high resolution images the degree of colocalization of dapi labeled bacterial dna with granulysin at indicated time points was determined. representative images of granulysin and granulysin/perforin treated dc are shown in fig. 7a and 7b, respectively, merged images in the upper row, colocalization micrographs in the lower row. colocalization of bacterial dna and granulysin was already observed to some extent when dc were only granulysin treated but more colocalization was found in dc that were simultaneously granulysin and perforin treated . quantification of these images revealed that after  <dig> minutes a plateau was reached with 14% of the listeria colocalized with the granulysin staining . when dc were incubated with granulysin and perforin we found after  <dig> minutes 36% of the listerial dna colocalized with granulysin that even slightly increased to 43% after  <dig> minutes. therefore, the overall transfer of granulysin to listeria containing phagosomes is increased in response to perforin.

discussion
recently we have shown a perforin-independent pathway of granulysin-mediated bacteriolysis in human dc  <cit> . granulysin proved to bind and to be endocytosed in a lipid raft-associated mechanism followed by transfer to l. innocua-containing phagosomes where bacteriolysis was induced. the killing of intracellular listeria by granulysin was shown to be dose-dependent, but full eradication of the bacteria was not achieved at any applied concentration.

in the current study we were able to demonstrate a significant and robust enhancing role of perforin in granulysin-mediated lysis of intracellular l. innocua in human dc. this enhancing effect could neither be explained by a simple cell loss due to perforin toxicity against the host cells nor by a direct antimicrobial activity of perforin. the observed role of perforin in our experimental system is in agreement with data of other groups describing perforin as a delivering or triggering molecule  <cit> . for the particular interaction of recombinant granulysin and purified perforin there is just a single study up to now that showed perforin to be essential for granulysin-mediated lysis of m. tuberculosis in human macrophages  <cit> . however, these results are not fully consistent with the results we obtained in our experimental system using a non pathogenic strain of l. innocua that is killed to some extent by granulysin alone. furthermore, l. innocua is transferred to lysosomes and killed within  <dig> hours by the dc itself . mycobacteria like l. innocua used in our system reside in phagosomes of the host cell  <cit>  but in contrast to l. innocua virulent mycobacteria have evolved mechanisms to prevent phagosome maturation, especially the fusion with lysosomes to form the lethal phagolysosomes  <cit> . this active interference of virulent mycobacteria with the endocytic machinery of the host cell might provide an explanation that granulysin alone does not gain access to the specialized mycobacteria-containing phagosomes and therefore is not capable of killing the bacteria without perforin.

the triggering role of perforin in the granzyme b-induced apoptosis is, in contrast to the mechanism of granulysin induced bacteriolysis, extensively investigated  <cit> , but underlying mechanisms are still under debate  <cit> . similar to granulysin, granzyme b is endocytosed independently of perforin but for induction of the target cell apoptosis it has to gain access to the cytosol. for this delivery step co-treatment of the target cell with perforin is essential  <cit> . the interaction of granzyme b and perforin is not fully comparable to the findings in our experimental system as we did not find any indication for cytosolic delivery of granulysin in response to perforin but observed enhanced vesicular targeting to l. innocua containing phagosomes.

as perforin was originally described as a pore forming protein we tested its pore forming capability in dc using ldh release assay as well as by the ability to promote the entrance of membrane impermeant ethd- <dig> or of ca2+. perforin in concentrations sufficient for enhanced lysis of intracellular l. innocua resulted in a transient ca2+ increase but not in a detectable release of ldh or accumulation of ethd- <dig> in listeria-challenged dc. the source of the ca2+ was demonstrated to be the extracellular space as blocking intracellular ca2+ channels had not effect on ca2+ waves triggered by perforin or ionomycin. this is further supported by low ca2+ buffer conditions which abolished perforin induced ca2+ fluxes. as perforin activity is dependent on free ca2+, this result might also refer to disturbed perforin membrane binding and multimerization. in our experimental system, no evidence could be provided for a granulysin induced ca2+ release from intracellular stores as this was reported for higher concentration of granulysin in tumor cells . these results clearly indicate that sublytic perforin triggers a short-lived disturbance of the plasma membrane permeability not sufficient for significant entrance of a small fluorescent dye but sufficient for a transient ca2+ influx.

it was coincidentally shown that unchallenged dc were more susceptible to perforin lysis than listeria-challenged dc. this interesting phenomenon might be explained by recent data showing elevated cathepsin b expression in toll-like receptor activated dc  <cit> . cathepsin b was on the other hand suggested to protect ctl and nk cells from autolysis after degranulation  <cit> . the protection effect of cathepsin b was called recently into question  <cit>  and as no further experimental evidence is provided, about mechanisms leading to higher resistance of listeria-challenged dc against perforin lysis can only be speculated.

in pulse-chase experiments it was demonstrated that enhanced bacteriolysis was still observed when dc were perforin treated up to  <dig> minutes subsequent to incubation with granulysin. on the other hand, pretreatment of dc with perforin prior to granulysin-mediated listeriolysis had no enhancing effect. these results suggest that stable perforin pores seem not to play a role in promoting augmented passive diffusion of granulysin into target cells. therefore, the classical pore formation model of perforin allowing delivery of lytic proteins by an increase of membrane permeability is not a major mechanism in granulysin uptake and the induction of enhanced intracellular bacteriolysis. there is a remarkable drop in the enhancing effect, if perforin is first added  <dig> minutes after pulsing the cells with granulysin. from this result coendocytosis of granulysin and perforin, at least to some extent, can not be excluded to play a role in the enhanced killing of l. innocua in dc. coendocytosis of granzyme b and perforin to a certain amount was shown to be critical for the induction of target cell apoptosis  <cit> . the biological role of the transient ca2+ flux remains to be clarified. recently, it was shown in hela cells that a sublytic perforin concentration triggers via ca2+ signaling a rapid membrane repair response in the sense of a cellular wound healing system  <cit> . this process includes the rapid removal of the damaged membrane area from the surface as well as the resealing with intracellular vesicles  <cit> . as a result of this increased membrane turnover in response to perforin, granzyme b is accelerated and augmented endocytosed by target cells  <cit> . part of this response is exuberant homotypic and heterotypic membrane fusion, which accelerates phagosome maturation  <cit> . in another study it was furthermore demonstrated that the inhibition of ca2+ signaling by mycobacterium tuberculosis is associated with reduced phagosome-lysosome fusion and crucial for the prolonged survival of the pathogen within phagosomes of macrophages  <cit> .

to further reveal the mechanism of perforin as an enhancing molecule we studied the impact of perforin on all critical steps of granulysin trafficking in dc, i.e. the binding and initial uptake, the transfer to early sorting endosomes and finally the transmission to l. innocua-containing phagosomes. sublytic concentrations  of perforin had no apparent effect on granulysin binding, uptake or transfer to early sorting endosomes. these results are not consistent with a recent study showing that sublytic concentrations of perforin triggers accelerated and enhanced endocytosis of granzyme b as well as transfer to large eea-1-positive vesicles in hela cells  <cit> . in our experimental system granulysin binding or initial uptake is not the limiting factor for the enhanced induction of bacteriolysis in dc in response to perforin. to the contrary, perforin at a concentration of  <dig> ku/ml significantly inhibited granulysin uptake in dc. as this perforin concentration is sublytic to dc, the finding of inhibited uptake was unexpected. because no experimental data is available, it can only be speculated if sublethal damage to dc by perforin inhibits complex cellular processes like endocytosis.

in contrast to binding and initial uptake vesicular targeting of granulysin to l. innocua-containing phagosomes was significantly enhanced by perforin treatment as an indication for improved endosome-phagosome fusion. early endosomes like all other endocytic organelles can fuse with phagosomes and this fusion process is ca2+ sensitive  <cit> . we found furthermore some evidence that elevated intracellular ca2+ indeed plays a role as a signal event promoting enhanced granulysin induced bacteriolysis. the ca2+ ionophor ionomycin showed a tendency to increase the granulysin mediated intracellular listeriolysis. the mechanism of the intracellular ca2+ elevation induced by ionomycin is presumably quite different from that induced by perforin which is also reflected in a different shape of the ca2+ waves with prolonged and incomplete recovery phases. this might explain the inefficient enhancement of ionomycin in comparison to perforin. on the other hand, it is not excluded that perforin triggers additional signalling cascades apart from ca2+ that are not activated by ionomycin. finally, we may speculate that sublytic perforin triggers the membrane repair response via ca2+ signalling. in the course of the membrane repair response endosome-phagosome fusion and thus transmission of granulysin to phagosomes is more likely resulting in enhanced bacteriolysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, perforin promotes enhanced bacteriolysis by granulysin not by the formation of stable pores that allow passive diffusion of granulysin but rather by an increase in endosome-phagosomes fusion triggered by an intracellular ca2+ rise.
