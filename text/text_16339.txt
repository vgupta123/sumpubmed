BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is a highly contagious disease of pigs caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus . the disease causes reproductive failure in pregnant sows; in particular it causes a respiratory disease characterized by reproductive failure  in pregnant sows
 <cit> . according to its antigenic differences, prrsv can be divided into two subgroups: the european-type subgroup a  reported by wensvoort in 1991; the european representative strain is the lv strain
 <cit> ; and the north american-type subgroup b  reported by benfield in 1992; the u.s. representative strain is vr-2332
 <cit> . the nucleotide sequence similarity of the two subgroups ranges from 54% to 67%. in the past, the predominant strains in europe were subgroup a, while in the united states and the asia-pacific region, b subgroups predominated. genetic analysis of chinese prrsv isolates showed that the main subgroup is the north american type. recently, however, prrsv has broken its geographical constraints. genotype-i prrsv has been reported in asia and north america, and american wild-type prrsv has been isolated in europe
 <cit> . the coexistence of genotype-i and -ii prrsv strains could cause problems for prrsv diagnosis and management. in recent years, several european type prrsv field isolates were reported in asian countries, such as south korea and thailand. genotype-i prrsv was also reported in china. various research groups have isolated genotype-i prrsv in china
 <cit> . importantly, the appearance of european type prrsv in china presented a significant challenge to the prevention and control of prrsv, increasing the difficulty of analyzing the highly pathogenic prrsv and the molecular mechanisms of immunization.

prrsv has a single-stranded, positive strand, non-segmented rna genome of about  <dig>  kb. it contains nine open reading frames , and adjacent orfs partially overlap. orf <dig> of prrsv encodes the gp <dig> protein, which shows approximately 54% to 60% amino acid identity between north american and european isolates. in addition, gp <dig> can accommodate cysteine mutations and influence the reproductive capacity of prrsv
 <cit> . experiments using a specific monoclonal antibody against the gp <dig> protein of the lv strain suggested that the gp <dig> protein is inserted into the virus particle or is a virus envelope-associated protein
 <cit> . the gp <dig> protein plays an important role in viral infectivity and may induce cellular immunity. gp <dig> is a glycosylated protein, known as the e protein. gp <dig> has six epitopes that can induce specific neutralizing antibodies. the neutralizing ability of the antibodies is stronger than those induced by gp4
 <cit> .

pigs infected with prrsv generate a series of anti-prrsv specific antibodies; however, these antibodies cannot completely remove prrsv and the immune response is slow. prrsv interferes with induction of the cellular innate immune response, which is closely linked with apoptosis. these may explain the slow porcine immune response; however, the mechanism of this interference remains unclear
 <cit> . viral epitopes that could induce neutralizing antibodies are located in the m, gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins. epitopes that can induce antibody-dependent enhancement -mediated effects are located in protein n and gp5
 <cit> . currently, there are two types of commercial vaccines for prrsv: modified live-attenuated vaccines  and killed vaccines. however, both of them have inherent drawbacks. killed vaccines are weakly immunogenic and cannot always provide protective immunity against prrsv infection
 <cit> . although mlvs can provide a certain degree of protection against prrsv, there is a possibility that the attenuated virus could return to high virulence
 <cit> . thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective vaccines against prrsv. dna vaccines are a new generation of safe vaccines, and immunization with dna vaccines elicit both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses
 <cit> .

vaccines require optimal adjuvants, including immunopotentiator and delivery systems, to offer long term protection from infectious diseases in animals. chitosan has well-defined properties including bioavailability, biocompatibility, low cost and an ability to open intracellular tight junction
 <cit> . therefore, chitosan, combined with advances in nanotechnology, can be effectively applied as a carrier system for vaccine delivery. quillaja  is a promising adjuvant that has been used in numerous prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. quil a modulates the cell mediated immune system as well as enhancing antibody production. in addition, only a low dose is needed for its adjuvant activity
 <cit> . in this study, dna vaccines pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig>  pvax1-eu-orf <dig> and pvax1-eu-orf <dig> were constructed based on the european lv strain  and formulated together with chitosan. quil a was used as an adjuvant to immunize mice with individual dna vaccines and their immunogenicities were evaluated using animal experiments.

RESULTS
purification of recombinant proteins gp3/gp5
the recombinant proteins expressed from pet-28a-orf <dig> and pgex-4 t-orf <dig> were recovered separately and subjected to sds-page . pgex-4 t-orf <dig> expressed a protein of 42 kda and pet-28a-orf <dig> expressed a protein of 35 kda, both of the expected size.

identification of expression gp <dig> and gp <dig> from the dna vaccines
to determine whether the viral proteins were expressed from the dna vaccines or not, bhk- <dig> cells were transfected with recombinant dna vaccines pvax1-eu-gp3-gp <dig> and recombinant vaccinia viruses rddvtt-gp3-gp <dig> and their protein amd mrna expressions were detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay  and rt-pcr . the ifa showed that recombinant vaccines transfected or infected into bhk- <dig> cells could be labeled with prrsv-specific antibodies , but cells transfected with pvax <dig> control were not labeled, proving that gp <dig> and gp <dig> were expressed in vitro. after transfection , the gp <dig> and gp <dig> mrna could be detected by rt-pcr .

detection of specific antibodies against gp <dig> and gp <dig> in immune sera
in the sera of mice immunized the dna vaccines expressing gp <dig> and gp <dig>  specific antibodies could be detected one week after immunization. however, compared with the control group at  <dig> dpi, the difference was not significant . the antibody levels continued to rise and showed a statistically significant difference compared with the control group after two weeks . a slight decrease was observed in the third week. after the booster immunization at 21 days, the antibody levels increased to a peak at 35 days post immunization . the antibody levels in the pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig> group were slightly higher than in the other two experimental groups; however, the difference was not statistically significant .

detection of neutralizing antibodies in sera
sera from immunized mice were collected and separated weekly to detect prrsv neutralizing antibody titers from two weeks after immunization. the neutralizing antibody titer in mice immunized with the dna vaccine co-expressing gp <dig> and gp <dig> protein  was significantly higher  than that in the groups immunized with pvax1-eu-orf <dig> and pvax1-eu-orf <dig> , and peaked at  <dig> dpi  . the neutralizing antibody titers of each experimental group were significantly higher than control groups   at  <dig> dpi; however, the neutralizing antibodies produced by the pvax1-eu-orf <dig> group had only a weak ability to neutralize the virus.

virus-neutralizing  antibody titers in mice after vaccination for different groups. serum samples  were collected at various time-points. prrsv-specific neutralizing antibodies were detected by a virus neutralizing assay with two-fold serial dilutions. the vn titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution in which no cpe was observed.

levels of secreted cytokines il- <dig> and ifn-γ after immunization
the levels of cytokines il- <dig> and ifn-γ, the main representative th <dig> cytokines, were detected in serum separated from collected blood at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi. the levels of il- <dig> in the experimental groups  were significantly higher than in the control groups   at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi; however, no significant difference was observed among the experimental groups . at  <dig> dpi, the levels of ifn-γ in the pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig> group were significantly higher than those in any of the other groups  . these results not only demonstrated that the constructed dna vaccines could effectively stimulate mice to produce specific th <dig> lymphocytes, contributing to the secretion of il- <dig> and ifn-γ , but also suggested the dna vaccine could induce a cellular immune response in mice. in addition, the combined antigen group showed a synergistically enhanced immune reaction in terms of secretion of ifn-γ and was superior to either single-antigen dna vaccine.

the secretion levels of cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> after immunization
the levels of cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the main representative of th <dig> cytokines, were detected in sera at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi. the il- <dig> and il- <dig> levels in the experimental group were significantly higher  than those in the control groups  at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi; however, no significant difference was observed among the experimental groups . at  <dig> dpi, the levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig> group were slightly, but not statistically significantly, higher than those in the pvax1-eu-orf <dig> group . these results indicated that the dna vaccine could effectively stimulate the body to increase the secretion of th <dig> cytokines related to the humoral immune response.

t lymphocyte proliferation response of mice
immunized mice stimulated with the non-specific antigen cona showed t lymphocyte proliferation, and the stimulation index  was significantly higher than the control groups  . upon stimulation with the prrsv lv strain virus antigen, the experimental group produced a specific t lymphocyte proliferative response, and the si difference was significant compared with the control group ; however, the differences among the experimental groups were not significant .

facs analysis of t lymphocyte subgroups from the spleens of immunized mice
two weeks after the second immunization, splenic lymphocytes were isolated and analyzed for cd3+cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ t lymphocytes. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the percentages of cd3+cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ t cells in each experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control groups  . mice inoculated with pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig> showed slightly higher levels of cd3+cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ t cells than mice inoculated each single antigen. this indicated that dna vaccines coexpressing orf <dig> and orf <dig> gene could stimulate murine cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocyte proliferation, and induce both humoral and cellular immune responses.

discussion
prrsv epidemics have resulted in the virus being spread throughout the world, causing huge economic losses to the pig industry. in the past, european strains of prrsv were limited to european countries, but have now spread to asia and north america
 <cit> . south korea, thailand, china and other countries have reported many european type prrsv strains in recent years
 <cit> . european strains ningbo <dig>  and fj <dig>  were isolated and found to be closely related to the genotype-i prrsv attenuated vaccine strain amervac-prrs/a3
 <cit> . the fj <dig> strain  has also been proven to be non-pathogenic to nursery pigs
 <cit> . two strains of wild-type genotype-i prrsv, bjeu06- <dig>  and nmeu09- <dig> , were isolated from a pig compound in 2011
 <cit> , which was the first report of genotype-i prrsv field strains in china. the appearance of genotype-i prrsv in china complicates the prevention and control of prrsv. genotype-i and -ii prrsv vaccines cannot provide cross-protection, and these two strains may produce recombinant virus, chimeric virus or a new virus, while the selection pressure exerted by antibodies could significantly affect the genetic variation of prrsv and change its antigenicity
 <cit> .

vaccination is the most effective and valuable tool to prevent infectious diseases. in this study, dna vaccines based on genotype-i prrsv were constructed. the dna vaccines were formulated together with chitosan and delivered in the form of chitosan-dna nanoparticles. chitosan has wide applications in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, textiles, food, cosmetics and agricultural industries
 <cit> . research has focused on chitosan’s use as a novel delivery vehicle for drugs, genes, peptides and vaccines, and as a scaffold for targeted delivery and tissue engineering applications
 <cit> . chitosan effectively binds dna via electrostatic interactions and protects it from nuclease degradation
 <cit> , which enhances transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo <cit> . to increase the efficiency of the vaccine, quil a  was used as an adjuvant when immunizing mice with individual dna constructs. one week after immunization, specific antibodies to gp <dig> and gp <dig> could be detected. three weeks after the booster immunization, the antibody levels continued to increase and were significantly higher than in the control groups. neutralizing antibodies were detected two weeks after immunization , probably because quil a enhanced the immune effect of the dna vaccine. quil a  is extracted from the evergreen tree quillaja saponaria as triterpenoid compounds
 <cit> , which activate th cells, cytotoxic t lymphocytes and b-cells. quil a improves the immune reaction of an antibody to an antigen; improves the production of antibody subclasses igg <dig>  igg2a and igg2b; and enhances the secretion of il- <dig>  tnf-β and ifn-γ
 <cit> . neutralizing antibodies play an important role in the anti-prrsv response. during prrsv infection, the induction of neutralizing antibodies indicates that the virus has begun to be cleared from the tissues and blood. previous studies showed that the gp <dig> protein of european strains has a neutralizing epitope between amino acids  <dig> and 73
 <cit> ; however, the detailed protein structure and function require further study. the data presented here showed that gp <dig> and gp <dig> could induce neutralizing antibodies in mice; however, the gp <dig> neutralizing antibody titer was low. co-expression of gp <dig> and gp <dig> produced a synergistic effect, resulting in a better neutralizing antibody response. the gp <dig> protein could induce specific neutralizing antibodies and serotype-specific linear epitopes could neutralize viral infections in vitro. a previous study showed that the neutralizing ability of gp <dig> was higher than that of gp <dig> and virus neutralization was significantly correlated with gp <dig> antibody titers
 <cit> .

in viral diseases, removal of the virus via cellular immunity plays an important role in the prevention of disease. cell-mediated immunity  is also extremely important in prrsv infection
 <cit> . previous studies have shown that cmi is significantly related to reduced clinical symptoms in prrsv-infected pigs
 <cit> . the prrsv-specific cmi response appears approximately 2– <dig> weeks after vaccination, as determined by lymphocyte proliferation and interferon γ  production in a recall reaction
 <cit> .

to detect the t cell-mediated immune response, we isolated mouse spleen lymphocytes and performed lymphocyte proliferation transformation experiments in vitro. we found that the experimental group could induce specific t cell proliferative responses after stimulation by a prrsv lv strain virus-specific antigen. these results also indicated that, in each experimental group, the levels of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were significantly higher  than those in the pbs and pvax <dig> immunized group . in the pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig> immunized group, the levels of cd4+ and cd8+ were higher than those in groups immunized with the single protein dna vaccines. the percentage of cd4+ t cells in the circulating peripheral blood is directly related to the severity of the disease in an animal. the smaller the proportion of cd4+ t cells, the more likely that the animals will develop a serious infection. cd4+cd8+ immune cells have an important function in antigen recognition. the immune response mediated by th <dig> cells could be affected by cd8+ t cells in prrsv infection
 <cit> . th <dig> cells in cd4+ subsets  secrete il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-β and other cytokines. th <dig> cells mainly mediate the immune response and play important roles in immune regulation of organ-specific autoimmune diseases, in organ transplant rejection and infection immunity. th <dig> cells in cd4+ subsets  secrete il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and other cytokines. th <dig> cells mainly regulate humoral immune responses and play a decisive role in the induction of anaphylaxis. in this study, the assessment of serum cytokines after vaccination revealed that the pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig> groups secreted significantly higher levels of ifn-γ than any other group at  <dig> dpi. while levels of il- <dig> and ifn-γ peaked at  <dig> dpi, those of il- <dig> and il- <dig> reached a maximum at  <dig> dpi in the pvax1-eu-orf3-orf <dig> group. these results indicated that mice immunized with dna vaccines were induced to produce both th1-type and th2-t cytokines after the booster vaccination.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the dna vaccines expressing gp <dig> and gp <dig> of genotype-i prrsv showed good immunogenicity, and the dna vaccine expressing both gp <dig> and gp <dig> produced better results. these data provided a theoretical basis for future experimental studies. in addition, careful selection of adjuvants or delivery systems can enhance prime-boost regimen-elicited immune responses, and new vaccine adjuvants can potentiate immunogenicity and the protective effect of prrsv vaccines. consequently, it is essential that future prrsv vaccines must be more potent, safe, effective, and provide better protection against prrsv. furthermore, the involvement of gp <dig> and gp <dig> proteins in viral proliferation and viral replication during infection-induced immune responses also requires further research.
