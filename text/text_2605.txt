BACKGROUND
fungi of the phylum basidiomycota have an important role in the global carbon cycle due to their ability to decompose plant biomass that is the richest carbon source on earth. basidiomycota class agaricomycetes, in particular the order polyporales, includes species which are efficient decomposers of wood and other plant biomass, and are able to activate and degrade lignin  <cit> . the ability to decompose polymeric wood components, that is cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, requires sets of carbohydrate active enzymes , and oxidoreductases such as peroxidases and laccases .

the fungal genus phlebia includes several lignin-modifying white rot species which have a high potential for forest-based biotechnology, biopulping, production of lignocellulose-active enzymes and conversion of lignin-derived compounds and xenobiotics . taxonomically, the genus phlebia is positioned to the polyporales phlebioid clade and to the family meruliaceae . the phlebioid clade includes mainly corticioid basidiocarp-forming species, and the clade consists of seven family names including phlebiaceae originally given by jülich in  <dig>  <cit> . the genus phlebia has a multitude of species  <cit>  with  <dig> and  <dig> taxons recorded in mycobank  and index fungorum , respectively . phlebia has several synonym genera - merulius, mycoaciella and mycoacia  <cit> .

the type species phlebia radiata fr.  <cit>  is widely distributed in north america and europe  <cit>  and has been a subject of genetic and biochemical studies . p. radiata is a white rot fungus which efficiently degrades lignin in softwood and hardwood  <cit> , depolymerizes milled pine wood  <cit> , mineralizes 14c-labelled synthetic lignin  to carbon dioxide  <cit> , and efficiently produces a versatile set of lignin-modifying oxidoreductases  . in addition to p. radiata, research has focussed on a few other species of the genus, e.g. p. tremellosa, p. brevispora, p. ochraceofulva and p. lindtneri, in regard to physiology and potential for bioconversion of plant biomass . according to genome sequencing of the species p. brevispora  <cit>  and p. radiata   <cit> , there is a versatile repertoire of genes encoding lignin-modifying and other lignocellulose-converting oxidoreductases, and multiple cazymes. however, while genomic data may predict the number of genes and potential functions of the extracellular lignocellulose-converting enzymes in fungal species, protein secretion and biochemical enzyme activities need to be verified by proteomics and activity assays, respectively. this is particularly important on natural growth substrates such as wood. therefore, we performed lignocellulose-converting enzyme activity profiling of  <dig> phlebia species on wood cultures. the production of lignocellulose-converting enzyme activities were compared with the molecular taxonomy, in order to find out if the enzyme phenotypes of the species groups were determined by their evolutionary proximity and genotype characters.

our second aim was to deepen the taxonomic knowledge of the phlebioid clade in polyporales and study the genetic diversity of phlebia by adopting rrna-encoding  and two cellular core protein-encoding genes - glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase  and nuclear rna polymerase ii . the internal transcribed spacer  sequence has been selected for fungal barcoding and identification  <cit> , giving adequate information for fungal isolate level molecular taxonomy and definition of species. recently, extensive its sequence analysis of phanerochaetoid taxa in the phlebioid clade enlightened the complex phylogeny of this clade  <cit>  and by focusing on the phlebia clade, our study even deepens the understanding of this clade. in our study, statistical and clustering analyses of the phlebia genotype groups with their enzyme activity production profiles demonstrated that the enzyme phenotypes correlated with the species group genotypes. thus, for the diverse phlebia species, there is a strong connection between the genotype and their cazyme and lignin-modifying oxidoreductase activity profiles on a natural-like, wood-supplemented growth medium.

RESULTS
molecular identification of phlebia isolates
results obtained from its1- <dig> s-its <dig> pcr and sequencing of the phlebia isolates confirmed their earlier identification results, which were mostly based on their basidiocarp morphological features, with a few exceptions . most of the fbcc  isolates previously identified to the species p. radiata were correctly confirmed including  <dig> isolates which were 100 % identical according to their complete its sequences . the only exceptions were the isolates fbcc <dig> and fbcc <dig>  which were over 99 % identical to the species p. acerina . in addition, the phylogenetic maximum likelihood analysis strongly supported positioning of the two isolates in the p. acerina branch  and thereby, these isolates were re-named p. acerina at the species level in this study.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood trees of the phlebioid clade and phlebia clade of polyporales based on its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequences.  maximum likelihood tree illustrating the separation of four clades  in the phlebioid clade. for the tree,  <dig> its sequences were aligned and phylogenetical analysis was performed using raxml v.  <dig> . <dig>  and 100x bootstrapping.  maximum likelihood analysis of its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequences from the phlebia clade. fungi of this study  are compared with related taxons with sequences retrieved from ncbi  database. bootstrap values  higher than 50 % are indicated for the nodes. quotation marks represent uncertain identification or provisional names suggested  <cit> . an its sequence of byssomerulius corium was used as an outgroup. scale bar represents  <dig>  nucleotide substitutions per position



also, the isolates fbcc <dig> and fbcc <dig> were re-named p. centrifuga and p. subserialis, respectively, according to their its-sequence identity  in comparison to taxon reference sequences  and support from high node bootstrap values  . considering p. subserialis, our isolate fbcc <dig> and one reference sequence were positioned far away from phlebia species into the phanerochaete clade. our its-sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were unable to confirm the previous identification for three isolates of the  <dig> studied. isolate fbcc <dig>  was positioned in the phlebiopsis clade but distant from phlebiopsis, rhizochaete and phaeophlebiopsis . isolate fbcc <dig>  was distantly related to the phlebia clade and was situated in the phanerochaete clade. however, more information is apparently needed to confirm the species level taxonomy, and therefore, these isolates were not yet given definite identities or taxon names, and are thus depicted phlebia sp. isolates .

its phylogeny
an its sequence dataset was generated for phylogenetic analyses of the polyporales phlebioid clade by including reference sequences retrieved from ncbi genbank and the sequences of this study. altogether  <dig> its sequences were included in the maximum likelihood  phylogram , and  <dig> sequences were positioned in the phlebia clade . the phylogenetic analyses resulted in three major clades in the phlebioid clade, which were named according to floudas and hibbet  <cit>  as phlebia, byssomerulius and phanerochaete clades. similarly as in the recent study  <cit> , the phanerochaete clade was divided into phlebiopsis and phanerochaete clades.

according to the its phylogeny, genus phlebia produced no single taxonomic cluster . while phlebia species are widely distributed in the its tree, the phlebia sensu stricto species form one uniform core group, which includes the type species p. radiata . the three species p. radiata, p. acerina and p. rufa are very closely related forming a distinct branch  in the phlebia clade. in addition, phlebia sensu stricto includes the species p. floridensis, p. brevispora, p. lindtneri, p. setulosa, p. serialis, p. leptospermi and p. tremellosa. it is noteworthy that the phlebia clade includes a number of isolates that were identified to the genera ceriporiopsis, scopuloides, climacodon, phlebiopsis, ceriporia and hydnophlebia .

furthermore, the species p. unica, p. firma, and two isolates of p. subserialis were clearly separated from the phlebia clade and were positioned in phanerochaete or phlebiopsis clades . three isolates without a previous species-level identity and thus named phlebia sp. were similarly positioned outside the phlebia clade.

four-gene phylogeny
according to the four-gene multilocus phylogeny analysis, phlebia isolates were divided into ten phylogroups . statistical analyses of the enzyme activity data were based on this grouping except for p. brevispora due to only one isolate cultivated for enzyme profiling. the first phylogroup included isolates of the species p. radiata and p. rufa . the well-supported sister lineage to this phylogroup was the p. acerina branch consisting of three isolates. according to the four-gene phylogeny, p. tremellosa clearly deviated from the p. radiata and p. acerina species groups with 100 % branching support . the species p. brevispora and p. livida, as well as p. hydnoides, p. chrysocreas and p. ochraceofulva all branched as sister lineages forming distinct species clusters or clades, and were therefore treated as separate phylogroups in the statistical enzyme-phenotype analyses.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogeny and exon-intron structure of partial gapdh nucleotide sequences of the phlebia isolates.  maximum likelihood phylogeny of the phlebia isolates showing the phylogroups formed.  <dig> s, partial lsu, and partial sequences from two protein-encoding genes  were concatenated for an alignment, and the phylogenetic analysis was performed using raxml v.  <dig> . <dig>  and 100x bootstrapping. sequences of related agaricomycetes species  were retrieved from jgi mycocosm database  <cit>  and ncbi . species names are followed by isolate culture collection identifiers. the sequences from species heterobasidion irregulare  were used as an outgroup. bootstrap values higher than 50 % are indicated for the nodes. scale bar represents  <dig>  nucleotide substitutions per position.  exon-intron structure of partial gapdh nucleotide sequences from the phlebia phylogroups studied. black and white areas indicate exons and introns, respectively

bthe isolates were grouped based on its sequence similarity and phylogrouping based on phylogenetic analyses of concatenated ssu, partial lsu sequences, and partial sequences from two protein-encoding genes 


cc = coniferous wood, d = deciduous wood



isolates of p. radiata, p. tremellosa, p. centrifuga and p. subserialis also diverged at the species level . however, the p. subserialis group was formed by only two isolates, and more noteworthy, the isolate fbcc <dig> is the nearest related to species of phanerochaete . moreover, the two phanerochaete species, phlebia subserialis, and the isolates phlebia sp. fbcc <dig> and fbcc <dig> were positioned far out from the phlebia sensu stricto, and in fact, these isolates were the most related to the species phlebiopsis gigantea and bjerkandera adusta .

presence or absence of introns, intron positioning and intron length varied in phlebia gapdh genes with respect to the species grouping . the p. radiata and p. acerina phylogroups had similar gapdh exon-intron structures and length of the sequenced region. p. tremellosa and p. hydnoides phylogroups were similarly uniform. other phylogroups showed variable sizes of gapdh pcr products due to differences in intron length and positioning. all p. centrifuga gapdh sequences had a unique intron b, whereas isolate fbcc <dig> from the p. subserialis group as well as phlebia sp. fbcc <dig> and all phlebiopsis gigantea isolates lacked both introns a and b. with the gapdh primers used, no pcr-product was obtained for the p. livida isolates, which leaves the question open whether this species group has a more variable gapdh gene structure than the other studied species. in general, exon-intron structure of the gapdh gene  was coherent with the multilocus sequence phylogeny and phylogrouping of phlebia species.

phylogenetic analyses conducted with either individual or contiguous its and partial lsu sequences, and respectively with individual or concatenated gapdh and rpb <dig> sequences, resulted in evolutionary trees with slightly different topologies than was obtained with the four-gene phylogeny . phylogenetic analyses based on its and gapdh sequences positioned p. brevispora near to p. radiata - p.acerina sister species, when the lsu and rpb <dig> sequences were not able to confirm its evolutionary placement . our four-gene phylogeny also positioned p. brevispora closer to p. livida than to p. radiata. positioning of p. livida as well as p. hydnoides was not supported by the protein-encoding sequences . taken together, similar fungal species-based phylogroupings were observed in all evolutionary analyses.

fungal growth rates and activity normalization
in order to test if the enzyme activities were influenced by the differences in fungal growth rates, we tried to estimate production of mycelium biomass  for each isolate and each culture flask in the end of cultivation. however, deviation of the dry weight values between the parallel cultures  was too divergent. this was probably due to wood sawdust particles that were attached to the mycelia. instead, we measured the hyphal growth rate on malt agar plates for each isolate, and used these values   to adjust the enzyme activity values  of day  <dig>  this normalization resulted in fairly similar differences between the isolates and species groups that was observed with the non-normalized enzyme activities, except for a few isolates of p. centrifuga .

production of enzyme activities
during the 21 days of cultivation on semi-solid liquid medium with milled spruce as a carbon source, all the  <dig> phlebia isolates produced lignocellulose-converting enzyme activities periodically . when the enzyme activity patterns were investigated on the 14th day of cultivation, differences between phlebia phylogroups became apparent . the p. radiata group produced the highest levels of oxidoreductase activities, that is laccase and manganese peroxidase   . the highest laccase activity,  <dig>  μkat l- <dig>  was observed in the cultures of p. radiata fbcc <dig>  whereas p. radiata fbcc <dig> produced the highest mnp activity . relatively high laccase and mnp activites were detected in the cultures of p. brevispora fbcc <dig>  even though the overall production of laccase in the p. centrifuga phylogroup was moderate, one isolate  in this group attained similar activity levels  as obtained in the p. radiata – p. acerina phylogroups. however, with normalized laccase activities another isolate of p. centrifuga  demonstrated the highest production value on the day  <dig>  which is due to its very slow hyphal growth rate . in the case of mnp activity, normalization of the data  caused minor differences, with an exceptionally high value for one slow-growing isolate of p. centrifuga  .fig.  <dig> fitted values of enzyme activities of each phylogenetic group. fitted values  of  laccase  mnp  cbh  β-glucosidase and  endoglucanase activities of each phylogenetic group during 21 days of cultivation in semi-solid milled spruce cultures

in contrast to the lignin-modifying oxidoreductases, the activity production profiles of the hydrolytic cazymes were more coherent within each phylogroup , and less evident differences were detected in the cazyme activity levels between the fungal isolates of each phylogroup . concerning cellulose-degrading enzyme activities, the highest level of endoglucanase activity was detected after two weeks for the isolates p. tremellosa, p. centrifuga and p. subserialis , peaking up to  <dig>  μkat l- <dig> in the culture liquid of p. centrifuga fbcc <dig>  cellobiohydrolase  activities in turn were marginal, and the highest values  were observed for the p. centrifuga phylogroup , which was furthermore obvious with the normalized activity values . the highest β-glucosidase activity  was also produced in the p. centrifuga phylogroup . activities of β-glucosidase in p. radiata, p. acerina, p. brevispora, p. tremellosa and p. ochraceofulva phylogroups were at similar levels but isolate-level differences within each of the phylogroups were detected . when cbh activities were studied, the p. radiata species group shared similar production patterns as p. acerina, p. tremellosa and p. hydnoides groups , and endoglucanase activities  were at the same levels in p. radiata, p. tremellosa and p. subserialis phylogroup cultures. isolate-level differences among the species groups were also observed in hyphal growth rates on me agar .

this study utilized generalized estimating equations  method to analyze differences resulting from enzyme activity values of the samples taken and measured at sequential time points. when the complete cultivation period  was studied, statistically significant differences in production of lignocellulose-converting oxidoreductases and cellulolytic enzyme activities were detected between the phylogroups . in the statistical calculations, time and species group were the explanatory variables, and also their interaction was statistically significant. when fitted values of enzyme activities of each phylogroup were plotted, the high variation of laccase activity production levels between the phylogroups was observed . p. radiata group produced the highest activities of laccase and mnp during the cultivation period. the second best producer of laccase activity were the p. tremellosa and p. hydnoides phylogroups which produced increasing amounts of laccase activity within the course of the cultivation. together with the p. radiata phylogroup, the p. acerina and p. tremellosa groups produced higher amounts of mnp activity compared to the other phylogroups. fitted values of enzyme activities of each phylogroup showed moderate production of cellulolytic activities. the phylogenetically most distant and incoherent group, the p. subserialis group, produced the highest cbh and β-glucosidase activities when compared to the other phlebia phylogroups.

ph values and culture acidity
the ph values of the culture fluids remained stable during the  <dig> d cultivation period for most of the fungal isolates . however, a few of the p. radiata isolates  and p. acerina isolate fbcc <dig> apparently acidified their cultures leading to final ph values below  <dig> , which suggests active production of organic acids. on the contrary, final ph values in the cultures of p. tremellosa isolates fbcc <dig> and fbcc <dig>  p. ochraceofulva isolates fbcc <dig> and fbcc <dig>  p. centrifuga isolate fbcc <dig>  and p. subserialis isolate fbcc <dig> increased to ph values over  <dig> .

enzyme phenotype clusters
to further visualize and compare the plant-biomass degrading enzyme production profiles as combinations of the periodical enzyme activity values of the fungal isolates, a double hierarchical clustering calculation method was adopted. similarities of enzyme activities in the semi-solid milled spruce cultures for each sampling day were calculated to create the data matrix. the normalized enzyme activity values on cultivation day  <dig> were selected for presentation .fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering of the phlebia isolates. hierarchical clustering presentation of lignocellulose-converting enzyme activities from fungal cultures on milled spruce wood on day  <dig>  the normalized values taking into account the hyphal growth rates were used for calculations. the isolates were numbered as listed in table 1




according to the normalized enzyme activity profiles at this time point, isolates of phlebia demonstrated three enzyme phenotype clusters . cluster c contained most of the isolates, including isolates of p. radiata and p. acerina, and this cluster demonstrated production of both laccase and mnp activities. cluster b showed high endoglucanase activities and contained sixteen isolates. in cluster a, enzyme activity production was more scattered but included the highest production of cellulose-degrading cbh activities. overall, clustering analysis pinpointed two enzyme production patterns: phlebia isolates producing high oxidoreductase  activities, and isolates showing high activities of cellulose-degrading enzymes .

discussion
in this study, we report on the interdependence of fungal molecular systematics  and extracellular enzyme activity profiles  for isolates of ten species of the largely unknown genus phlebia and other representatives of the phlebioid clade of polyporales. the  <dig> fungal isolates were subjected to multilocus gene phylogeny, and cultivated on semi-solid spruce wood medium to follow wood-decay enzyme activities for a three-week period.

besides enzyme production profiling, our second attempt was to examine molecular systematics of the taxonomically incoherent genus phlebia, and to more accurately position the type species  in the genus and phlebioid clade. the genus phlebia has been proposed to be a set of unrelated taxa that have some shared morphological traits  <cit> . our sequence-based phylogenetic study was also conducted in order to confirm taxonomic species-level identity of phlebioid and phlebia isolates with previous history of principally morphology-based identification.

several studies – both traditional and modern molecular systematics applying - have tried to resolve the taxonomy of the multiple genera positioned in the phlebioid clade of polyporales, but so far without complete success . the recent study on phanerochaetoid fungi increased this knowledge but showed the need for reference sequences for some of the species. our study provided  <dig> new sequences, and the phylogenetic analyses, both multilocus alignment and single-gene phylogenetic analysis, produced phylograms which point out that fungi with taxon species name phlebia are found in most of the currently recognized lineages of the phlebioid clade   <cit> .

in our study, the barcode marker sequence  <cit>  demonstrated its usefulness for concluding phylogenetic positioning of evolutionarily closely and more distantly related species of phlebia. although the its region is useful to resolve fungal phylogenetic relationships to certain extent, the importance of using other non-protein and protein-encoding genes to resolve the phylogenetic position of certain phlebia species has been demonstrated  <cit> . for these reasons, we included three genes - rrna lsu, and protein-encoding gapdh and rpb <dig> - to improve the outcome of our molecular systematic and evolutionary analyses.

species named as phlebia can be found in other clades of polyporales, for example the species p. bresadolae and p. queletii belong to the ‘residual polyporoid clade’  <cit> . it has been described earlier that the phlebia clade is not uniformly composed of only phlebia species  <cit> . this study confirmed that the phlebia clade includes also fungal isolates identified to the genera ceriporiopsis, scopuloides, climacodon, phlebiopsis, ceriporia and hydnophlebia. this demonstrates the difficulty to obtain a uniform phylogenetic analysis on phlebia species. for that reason, extensive its phylogeny was used as a starting point for generating phlebia, phanerochaete and phlebiopsis clades, wherein our isolates were positioned. after analyzing the phlebia clade, our study confirmed the existence of the phlebia sensu stricto  <cit> . according to our its analysis we propose that at least p. lindtneri, p. serialis and p. leptospermi should be added to this core group. it remains unclear, if p. centrifuga belongs to the core group since other phylogenetic analyses of this study and other studies on p. centrifuga  <cit>  are not supporting this positioning.

species-level identity of most of our fungal isolates was confirmed by the four-gene and its sequence phylogeny analyses, and taxonomic re-positioning occurred only for a few phlebia-named isolates. two isolates  previously identified as p. radiata were re-classified to p. acerina due to their high its sequence identity  to p. acerina isolates. sampling of the reference its sequences of p. radiata, p. acerina and p. rufa taxons obtained from ncbi showed that some of these isolates were incorrectly named. difficulty to identify and discriminate these three species by using traditional methods is not a surprise since p. rufa, p. acerina and p. radiata are very similar in their basidiocarp  and hymenial macro-structure and micro-morphology  <cit> , thus also supporting their genetic similarity and evolutionary close speciation.

p. chrysocreas isolates of this study  were separated from the four reference p. chrysocreas isolates according to its sequence phylogeny. four reference sequence isolates without species-level identity  fall in between this rather scattered branch. p. ochraceofulva isolates  produced a separated lineage without reference sequences. their identity is problematic to confirm without more reference taxons.

another peculiarity is the positioning of the isolate p. subserialis fbcc <dig> in our phylogenetic analyses, which supported clustering of the isolate far from the phlebia clade to the phanerochaete clade. different taxonomic positioning of isolates of p. subserialis has been observed in earlier studies . according to our its phylogeny, there is a phlebia subserialis lineage  in the phlebia clade and a second lineage in the phanerochaete clade . recently, a third p. subserialis lineage has been demonstrated in the phlebia clade  <cit> . six p. subserialis its sequences were positioned in the phanerochaete clade, but they were separated into two lineages . the first lineage includes our isolate fbcc <dig>  a provisional species name of phanerochaete krikophora was given to the second lineage  <cit> .

we cultivated the phlebioid isolates on semi-solid medium containing milled norway spruce wood, which is a natural lignocellulose substrate for a multitude of polyporales wood-decay species in the northern temperate and boreal forests. most of the phlebia species prefer angiosperm wood for growth but may also colonize dead gymnosperm wood  <cit> . for instance p. centrifuga is usually observed as a saprotroph of norway spruce  <cit> . so far, production and activities of wood-decay enzymes has been reported only for a few species of the phlebioid clade. in our study, the wood-containing medium supported production of lignin-modifying oxidoreductase and cazyme activities in species of phlebia.

in general, moderate levels of cellulolytic endoglucanase activity were produced by all phlebioid isolates, and the highest activities were measured after two weeks of growth. production of low endoglucanase activities on wood cultures by p. radiata and p. tremellosa isolates was demonstrated earlier  <cit> , and negligible amounts of other cellulolytic activities have been observed for p. radiata cultures on lignocellulose substrates  <cit> . the type species p. radiata produces several cellulolytic enzymes, including β- <dig> -endoglucanase, exo-β- <dig> -glucanase, aryl-β- <dig> -glucosidase, and β- <dig> -glucosidase  <cit> , hemicellulolytic enzymes, including β-xylosidase and endo- <dig> -β-xylanase  <cit> , and debranching enzymes, such as α-glucuronidase and α-galactosidase, which may cleave the glucosyl side-chains of hemicelluloses and pectin  <cit> . in this respect, it was expected that production of a wide array of cazymes acting on wood polysaccharides would be as general as in p. radiata at least among the phlebia sensu stricto species. the measured cazyme activities were reasonably coherent within the species phylogroups, and the few observed differences between fungal isolates  may be a consequence of differences in the hyphal growth rates of the isolates.

according to enzyme activity production profiling, p. subserialis isolate  and most of the isolates of p. acerina and p. radiata clustered differently in the double hierarchical clustering calculation analysis. also statistical analyses showed that the p. subserialis phylogroup produced higher cellulolytic enzyme  activities during the cultivation period compared to species that were included in the phlebia sensu stricto. phenotype similarity of p. subserialis to the genus phanerochaete is well supported in this context, since phanerochaete species  are well known producers of cellulolytic enzymes, with several cazymes and respective genes characterized .

considering the lignin-modifying oxidoreductases, our study reveals that there are significant differences in production of laccase activities among the phlebia species groups. production of laccase activity was one of the features clearly distinguishing between the enzyme phenotype groups. this is rather surprising since production of laccase has classically categorised wood-decay fungi as white rot and lignin-modifying species  <cit> . however, in line with the accumulating genomic data and comparative genomics on basidiomycota and polyporales species, the role of laccase in decomposition of wood lignin has been questioned  <cit> . instead, it is more evident that secreted class ii heme peroxidases and in particular, various mnps are necessary for lignin degradation and white rot type of wood decay  <cit> .

in this respect, it was assumed that all phlebioid isolates studied could actively produce mnp when growing on spruce wood. convincingly, mnp activities were either at moderate steady levels throughout the cultivation period, or a pattern of cyclic production  was observed for closely related p. radiata, p. acerina and p. tremellosa strains. cyclic production of mnp has been reported for p. radiata isolate fbcc <dig> on milled alder wood under similar cultivation conditions  <cit> . furthermore, high mnp activities as well as protein properties for mnp enzymes  and isoenzymes have been reported for several phlebia species  , and divergent mnp genes have been cloned from e.g. p. radiata  <cit> .

surprisingly, no lignin peroxidase  activity was detected in the spruce wood cultures of any of the phlebioid isolates studied, although isolates of p. radiata, p. tremellosa, p. floridensis, p. brevispora and p. ochraceofulva produced lip enzymes under variant culture conditions and in cultures including solid lignocellulose supplements  <cit> . for p. radiata, lip activity has been reported even on similar semi-solid cultures but supplemented with alder sawdust  <cit> , and three lip-encoding genes have been cloned and characterized in this species  <cit> . partial lip gene sequences were amplified from isolates of p. tremellosa and p. chrysocreas  <cit> . in several previous studies  <cit>  the authors have discussed that lip activities may not be detectable due to the presence of coloured, apparently phenolic compounds, which are dissolved in the fungal cultures from the wood and plant biomass substrates. these type of compounds may have masked lip activities also in our study.

our its sequence phylogeny analysis was in agreement with the recent extensive its phylogeny study on taxa of phanerochaete and related genera  <cit> . the protein-encoding gene  regions, however, were somewhat less successful in supporting evolutionary positioning of our set of phlebia isolates. the gapdh primers designed and applied in this study resulted in a higher frequency of pcr amplification than obtained with rpb <dig> primers. accordingly, gapdh intron positioning was one of the genotyping features most conserved among the phlebia sensu stricto species. presence of a unique second intron in gapdh genes of p. centrifuga isolates differentiated this species from phlebia sensu stricto. one challenge in using the gapdh region for molecular systematics and phylogenetic analyses is yet the lack of reference sequences in nucleotide sequence databases. for this reason, current use of primers targeted to its sequences and rrna encoding genes together with carefully selected conserved protein-encoding genes promotes coherency for taxonomic comparison and fungal systematics.

CONCLUSIONS
our study on the polyphyletic genus phlebia infers that the fungal phylogroups showed significant differences in lignocellulose-converting enzyme phenotypes according to generalized estimation statistical analysis. these results may reflect different efficiencies of the enzyme-production profiles of phlebia species in their natural habitats, and predict their life-style differences on strategies to degrade various types of wood and lignocellulose. knowledge of the taxonomy and physiological versatility of genus phlebia has a great importance for more applicative studies on fungal enzyme production and bioconversion abilities. our study is the first using such approach of combined molecular genotyping and enzyme activity profiling, and may thus be an example for similar research for systematically unknown or biochemically less studied wood-decay fungi, and aid in characterizing new fungal species and isolates.
