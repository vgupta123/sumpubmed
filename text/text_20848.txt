BACKGROUND
palm oil is one of the traditional fats that have been widely used throughout the world in human diet. global palm oil production was estimated to  <dig> million ton during 2007/ <dig>  accounting for 40% of the worldwide production of total dietary oils  <cit> . palm oil contains a mixture of high and low melting triglycerides. by a simple dry fractionation process under a controlled temperature, palm oil can be resolved into a liquid  and a solid  fraction  <cit> . the palm olein fraction is the mostly used in industry due to its low melting point  <cit> . the high melting point of palm stearin  poses problems in manufacturing of edible fats such as margarine and shortenings as it confers low plasticity to the end product. many attempts have been carried out to maximise the use of palm stearin by transesterification  <cit> . among transesterification reactions, alcoholysis of triacylglycerols to produce wax esters is relatively a simple process and rather economically important to the oil and fat industries  <cit> .

waxes are esters of long-chain fatty acids and long-chain alcohols. the principal natural sources of waxes are from animals and vegetables  <cit> . they can be composed of saturated and unsaturated wax esters. the saturated wax esters are predominant in beeswax, whereas, traditional raw materials for unsaturated wax esters are sperm whale and jojoba oil. commercial waxes have a wide range of applications as lubricants, polishes, plasticizers, coating materials in the pharmaceutical and food industries. they are also used as ingredients in the formulation of cosmetics and other chemical products  <cit> 

enzymatic synthesis of wax esters from different raw materials have been reported  <cit> . in these studies, high yields of palm oil based wax esters have been obtained. few studies reported the use of palm stearin and oleyl alcohol to generate wax esters  <cit> . the stearin fraction of palm oil is technologically underutilized because of its high melting point. the objective of our study was to promote the use of the palm stearin fraction of palm oil in wax esters synthesis. furthermore, this is to our knowledge the first study of using cetyl alcohol and palm stearin to synthesize wax esters by means of response surface methodology.

enzymatic synthesis of wax esters from palm stearin and cetyl alcohol, a typical fatty alcohol present in natural waxes  <cit> , was carried out using a non commercial immobilised lipase from rhizopus oryzae  <cit> . a three-level four-factor central composite rotatable design was adopted in our study to determine the optimum conditions. this method is a useful technique to predict the best performance conditions with a reduced number of experiments  <cit> .

methods
fractionation process
refined, bleached and deodorized palm oil, of iodine value  <dig> , was obtained from the tunisian olive oil office. it was fractionated in the laboratory using a dry fractionation process, according to the method described by thiagarajah  <cit> . palm oil was melted and kept homogenized at 70°c to destroy all crystals present. the melted oil was agitated with stirring rate of  <dig> rpm. a fractionation temperature of 30°c was used. after stabilization, two fractions were obtained, namely stearin  and olein . they were separated by vacuum filtration. the palm stearin fraction was used to produce wax esters.

production and immobilisation of lipase
rhizopus oryzae lipase was produced as described by ben salah et al  <cit> . the enzyme immobilization was made onto caco <dig> as described by ghamgui et al  <cit> . the activity of immobilized lipase was measured titrimetrically with a ph-stat, under the standard assay conditions described previously by rathelot et al  <cit>  using olive oil  emulsion as substrate. one international unit  of lipase activity was defined as the amount of lipase that catalyzes the liberation of  <dig> μmol of fatty acid per min at ph  <dig>  and 37°c.

experimental design
response surface methodology was applied to establish the relationship between the response studied  and the four selected experimental variables  and substrate concentration). a quadratic polynomial model has been postulated and represented by the following equation:  

where:  is the conversion yield; b <dig>  bj, bjk and, bjj are the estimated model coefficients and xj is the coded variables. in this study, the generation and the data treatment of the composite design are performed using design-expert  <dig> software .

transesterification reactions
according to the experimental design , the transesterification reactions were carried out in screw-capped flasks containing different amount of cetyl alcohol  and palm stearin .  <dig> ml of n-hexane were added in all reaction mixtures. different concentrations of immobilized lipase were also added in the mixtures with respect to the reaction conditions in table  <dig>  the reaction mixture was incubated at different temperatures and shaked . a control reaction without adding enzyme was carried out in parallel. after a reaction time of  <dig> h,  <dig> μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and the immobilized enzyme was removed by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm  for  <dig> min. the supernatant was used to analyze wax esters yields. all samples were assayed in duplicates to reduce inter-assay variations and the mean values of the replicates were reported.

tlc analysis
the reactants were separated by thin-layer chromatography  at room temperature according to keng et al  <cit> . after elution, the plates were dried and stored in an iodine chamber. the presence of the cetyl alcohol, palm stearin fractions and their corresponding esters were detected as brown spots and were identified as compared to authentic standards. wax standards used were: cetyl oleate, cetyl palmitate, cetyl linoleate and cetyl stearate synthesized in our laboratory. quantification of the tlc plate was accomplished with the software mcid analysis v <dig>  from imaging research . the ratio: optical density values/spot area for palm stearin was measured by the mcid software. the initial  optical density/spot area value corresponds to 100% of the substrate. the residual optical density/spot area value  measured at the end of the reaction corresponds to the residual substrate . the conversion yield corresponds to .

hplc analysis
the identification of wax esters was carried out by hplc analysis. it was performed on a perkin elmer apparatus composed of series  <dig> uv/vis detector and series  <dig> micro pump. the column was a lichrospher  <dig> rp- <dig>   <dig> μm , and its temperature was maintained at 45°c. the flow rate was  <dig>  ml/min. the mobile phase used was acetonitrile/acetone  for a total running time of  <dig> min. peak detection was monitored at  <dig> nm  <cit> .

RESULTS
immobilized rhizopus oryzae lipase was used to catalyze the synthesis of wax esters. the addition of hexane to the reaction medium was found necessary to improve the stability of the immobilized rhizopus oryzae lipase and the solubility of the substrates . furthermore, the addition of water at the beginning of the reaction failed to improve the conversion yield. in the light of preliminary studies , the temperature, the enzyme concentration, the alcohol/tg molar ratio and the substrate concentration which were the most effective on the response, were chosen as operating variables  to optimize the synthesis yield.

model fitting and anova
to carry out a cuboidal composite experimental design, a high and a low level were chosen for each factor . table  <dig> shows the real experimental conditions of the composite design with the corresponding measured responses. the results were analyzed using a multi regression method  <cit> .

fitting the data to various models  and their subsequent anova showed that reactions of palm stearin and cetyl alcohol were most suitably described using a quadratic polynomial model . the second-order polynomial equation generated by the design-expert software is:  =  <dig>  +  <dig>  x <dig> +  <dig>  x <dig> +  <dig>  x <dig> -  <dig>  x <dig> -  <dig>  x1x <dig> +  <dig>  x1x <dig> +  <dig>  x1x <dig> +  <dig>  x2x <dig> -  <dig>  x2x <dig> +  <dig>  x3x <dig> +  <dig>  x12- <dig>  x <dig> -  <dig>  x <dig> - <dig>  x <dig>  where x <dig>  x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> are the coded variables.

2fi = two factor interaction;

press = predicted residual error sum of squares;

a: suggested model to be selected;

b: aliased model not to be selected

+ case with leverage of 1: press statistic not defined.

in order to determine the adequacy of the quadratic model, an analysis of variance  was conducted using the usual fisher's f-tests , in which the regression sum of squares is subdivided into two parts. one attributed to the linear regression and the other to the quadratic model  <cit> .

a: indicates significant at the level of 99%

b: indicates insignificant at the level of 99%

estimated standard deviation is equal to std. dev. = √ <dig> / <dig> =  <dig> 

the regression sum of squares was statistically significant when using the f-test at a 99% probability level. this suggests that the variation taken into account by the model was significantly greater than the unexplained variation. likewise, the statistically insignificant lack of fit and the satisfactory levels of r-squared  indicated that the model was statistically significant and adequate to represent the relationship between the experimental parameters.

coefficients of the model were evaluated by regression analysis and tested for their significance . p-values lesser than  <dig>  indicates that the model terms are significant. among these parameters, the enzyme concentration  and substrate concentration  have highly significant effects  on the synthesis of wax esters as compared to the temperature and the alcohol/palm stearin molar ratio. interactions between temperature and molar ratio alcohol/palm stearin  on one hand and substrate concentration and temperature on the other hand  were found to be modestly significant.

graphical interpretation of the response surface model
relationships between the response and the experimental parameters were explored using contour plots. the response surface and the isoresponse curves were plotted against two variables while the two others were held constant at their mean levels.

ester synthesis increased rapidly with increasing the enzyme amount. however, the reaction temperature did not have an appreciable influence on ester synthesis. a high conversion yield  was reached by using a high enzyme concentration  for a very large range of temperatures.

both enzyme and substrate concentrations seem to play an important role in enhancing synthesis yield of palm stearin based wax esters . a significant decrease in the conversion yield was noticed when using a high substrate concentration at any enzyme concentration. on the contrary, a high conversion yield was accomplished by using a low substrate concentration  and a high enzyme concentration . these findings are in line with previous reports that the presence of a high substrate concentration could have a negative effect on lipase catalyzed synthesis activity  <cit> . besides, alcohols are known to be terminal inhibitors of lipases  <cit> . furthermore, high amount of palm stearin would lead to a greater resistance to mass transfer because of a higher viscosity of the medium  <cit> .

optimal reaction conditions
the optimal synthesis conditions of palm stearin based wax esters were predicted using the optimization function of the design expert software. these optimal conditions are presented in table  <dig> along with their experimental and predicted values. a good correlation was found between predicted and experimental values implying that empirical models derived from response surface methodology can adequately describe the relationship between the factors and their influence on the palm stearin based wax esters synthesis.

a: indicate insignificant at the level of 99%

among the various optimum conditions, the highest conversion yield was obtained for experiment  <dig>  which is carried out at 30°c, using  <dig> iu/ml of enzyme, an alcohol/triglyceride molar ratio of  <dig> and a substrate concentration of  <dig>  g/ml. under these optimal conditions, the time course of the alcoholysis reaction between the palm stearin and the cetyl alcohol was presented in figure  <dig>  the conversion yield increased rapidly to reach its maximal value of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % within  <dig> h of reaction time. the experimental optimal synthesis yield value was close to the calculated one . rhizopus oryzae lipase immobilized on caco <dig> used in this work shows an interesting behavior by providing a high esterification yield  within  <dig> h of reaction time. a comparable synthesis yield  was obtained by keng et al  <cit> , but within a longer reaction time  when using palm oil and oleyl alcohol as substrates and lipozyme as biocatalyst. nevertheless, much lower synthesis yields were reported by gunawan et al  <cit>   when esterifying oleyl alcohol and palm oil by lipozyme, used as biocatalyst. it's worth to notice that theses studies were also optimized using rsm methodology.

tlc and hplc analysis of palm based wax esters under optimal conditions
hplc analysis of palm stearin wax esters  was conducted and identification of peaks was carried out by comparing the chromatograms to those of authentic standard esters. the four main wax esters were cetyl palmitate, cetyl stearate, cetyl oleate and cetyl linoleate corresponding to retention times of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  min, respectively. the peaks corresponding to triglycerides disappeared indicating they were all transesterified with cetyl alcohol to produce wax esters. these results are in agreement with the measured high conversion yields .

CONCLUSIONS
the enzymatic synthesis of palm stearin based wax esters by means of esterification with cetyl alcohol using an immobilized rhizopus oryzae lipase as a biocatalyst was carried out in n-hexane. response surface methodology was successfully applied to determine the optimum operational conditions for maximal conversion yields of palm stearin. the greatest conversion yields were obtained for a high enzyme concentration, a moderate alcohol/triglyceride molar ratio and a low substrate concentration. for example, a high conversion yield of  <dig> % was reached within  <dig> h at 30°c, using an enzyme concentration of  <dig> iu/ml, an alcohol/triglyceride molar ratio of  <dig> and a substrate concentration of  <dig>  g/ml. this study may provide useful tools to develop economical and efficient processes for the synthesis of wax esters.
