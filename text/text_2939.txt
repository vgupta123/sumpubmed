BACKGROUND
the development of a complex eukaryote originates with just a single cell. a few years later it culminates in a functional organism possessing ~ <dig> trillion cells delineated into ~ <dig> cell types co-ordinately arranged in time and space  <cit> . a single genome, which is largely static, orchestrates this remarkable event, which is highly dynamic, - but it is still not known how. more specifically, what genomic information turns the right genes on at the right time and in the right place? this problem can be framed in terms of the gene regulation through the action of transcription factors  on their target genes  - a well-documented mechanism by which the protein encoded by a tf gene accesses the cell nucleus and binds to tf binding sites , located in the promoter region of a tg activating or inhibiting its transcription. importantly, such regulation acts in a species-, tissue- and time-specific manner  <cit> .

based on such framework, many authors have exploited the guilt-by-association heuristic by which genes regulated by the same tf are more likely to show co-expression correlation and, conversely, sets of genes showing an extreme co-expression correlation are more likely to be regulated by the same set of tfs. inspired by such heuristic, a rational approach for exploiting this co-expression phenomena and deciphering transcriptional regulation activity involves the reverse-engineering of gene regulatory networks using network inference algorithms such as  bayesian networks  <cit> , clr  <cit> ; aracne  <cit> , and pcit  <cit> . erg√ºn et al.  <cit>  exploited the connectivity structure of a gene network to an expression data set and identified genetic drivers of prostate cancer using the so-called mni algorithm  <cit> . other authors  <cit>  have undertaken a promoter sequence analysis of a correlated group of genes to identify sequence motifs corresponding to tfbs. using the prediction of binding affinities of a tf to promoters, roider et al.  <cit>  proposed a method for detecting tfs associated with functional categories.

an equally commendable strategy relies on assigning regulators to modules based on the co-expression between a candidate regulator and each of the members of the module. examples of the latter approach include the lemone  algorithm of joshi et al.  <cit>  which generates a number of possible models explaining regulation activity and with every single model containing many regulators. an alternative method, initially introduced by reverter et al.  <cit>  and more recently implemented in hudson et al.  <cit> , is based on ranking tf by their absolute co-expression correlation averaged across all genes in a given module.

more recently, our group  <cit>  developed a metric, namely rif for regulatory impact factors, which ranked tfs by analysing the extreme score to those tf that are consistently most differentially co-expressed with the highly abundant and highly differentially expressed genes , and to those tf with the most altered ability to predict the abundance of differentially expressed genes .

in spite of this plethora of work aimed at identifying the key tfs responsible for a phenotypic contrast of interest , experimental validation linking co-expression with co-regulation remains scarce and, by and large, available only for model organisms. for instance, based on  <dig>  yeast genes and  <dig> tfs, allocco et al.  <cit>  investigated and quantified the link between co-expression and co-regulation in yeast and concluded that the correlation co-expression must be greater than  <dig>  in order for two genes to have a greater than 50% chance of sharing a common tfbs. also working with  <dig> yeast tfs, yu et al.  <cit>  observed that genes targeted by the same tf tend to be co-expressed, with the degree of co-expression increasing if genes share more than one tf. the authors also reported that targets of a given tf tend to have similar cellular functions. similarly, the relationship between gene co-expression and co-regulation has been explored in drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> . however, given that only three-fifths of the transcriptional networks are broadly conserved, and the associations between tfs and their tgs are flexible  <cit> , there is a need to explore these matters in the actual organism, and indeed preferably in the tissue of interest, rather than making system-wide predictions based on the closest model organism.

furthermore, based on the observed relationship between tfs and their tgs, some authors have studied gene regulatory networks for model organisms and focussed on the hierarchical structure of the resulting networks  <cit> . only more recently, hu and gallo  <cit>  provide a catalogue of tf pairs, defined as those with tfbs in the same promoter regions, for human genes and in a tissue-specific manner. however, their work is based on only  <dig> tf and the authors did not investigate the relationship between tf pairs and co-expression of pairs of genes sharing tf pairs. in the light of these shortcomings, it is apparent that more research is needed to understand the relationship between co-expression and co-regulation.

we have elected to focus our efforts on the development of skeletal muscle and the longissimus thoracis et lumborum  in particular. skeletal muscle makes up to 50% of the mass of most mammals and is the single largest tissue contributor to basal metabolism  <cit> . by merging transcriptional and regulatory information, we aimed to shed light on a range of fundamental hypotheses including: 1) that a relationship exists between co-expression and co-regulation; 2) that the way in which tfs partner with each other scales with the number of common tgs and, in turn, influences the amount of co-expression observed between the tfs; and 3) that tfbs over-represented in the promoter regions of functionally coherent gene modules allows for the identification of tfs and tf networks that are consistent with the biological process of the module.

we first introduce a 'promoterome' matrix  relating tgs with predicted tfs. in combination with the expression data, this matrix is used to test our first two hypotheses . we then generate a series of simulated datasets to identify under which conditions, in terms of activation and inhibition, the observed relationship between co-expression and co-regulation can emerge. finally, we reverse-engineer a network of tfs and discuss its biological relevance in the context of functionally coherent modules.

RESULTS
the p-matrix - a bovine muscle promoterome matrix linking tfs with predicted tgs
we explored the  <dig> , <dig> co-expression correlations among the  <dig>  genes of the p-matrix . of these, 63% and 37% were positive and negative, respectively. we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  have reported a higher reliability for positive correlations, in terms of the ability to replicate them in other datasets, or the results corresponding to validated interactions  <cit> .

linking of co-expression, co-regulation and common targets
figures  <dig> provide a snapshot of the results relating co-expression with shared tfbss. we observed an increase in the average co-expression correlation as the number of common tfs increased . this pattern was consistent irrespective of whether the absolute and positive correlations were considered separately. however, this relationship was more apparent when only positive correlations were considered. for pairs of genes predicted to be jointly targeted by  <dig> or more tfs, we found a 4% and a 6% increase in absolute and positive correlations respectively, compared with random pairs of genes .

we also observed  a strong monotonic increase in the strength of the co-expression between a tf pair and the number of tgs they share. to the best of our knowledge, no study exists exploring this relationship. among the  <dig>  pairs existing from the  <dig> tfs with expression data,  <dig>  where among tf pairs sharing at least one tg. for these, the number of tgs in common averaged  <dig> and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

one final objective in exploring the relationship between co-expression and co-regulation was to assess whether the average co-expression correlation between a tf and its tgs is higher than the average co-expression between the same tf and all genes in the dataset . out of the  <dig> tfs with expression data,  <dig>  showed a ratio > <dig>  corresponding to a cumulative binomial p-value of  <dig> . when this relationship was limited to the  <dig> tfs for which their absolute correlation co-expression with their tgs was above average , we found that  <dig> of them  showed a ratio > <dig> . this distinction is of relevance because, under the null hypothesis of no relationship, tfs showing extreme correlation with their tgs should also show extreme correlation with all genes in the dataset.

on the superior reliability of positive co-expression correlations
simulation analyses reveal the most likely regulation type
as discussed by yu et al.  <cit> , there are two main reasons for regulation type to impact on the relationship of the expression of their targets. one is that a sizeable proportion of tfs act both as activators and repressors, in some cases for the same target. the other is that the combined effect of multiple tfs can have an unpredictable effect on target expression. figure  <dig> illustrates the results from our simulation analyses. one prominent feature is that in order to observe a relationship between co-expression and co-regulation there must be a sizeable proportion of tfs acting as either activators or repressors, but not both. in fact, the relationship between co-expression and co-regulation quickly diminishes with increasing proportion of tfs with bipotential activity  . most interestingly, in the extreme scenario where all tfs have bipotential activity, no relationship between co-expression and co-regulation could be observed and the resulting distribution of the correlations would be perfectly centred at zero . instead, such density sees its mass shifted towards the positive space with an increasing proportion of tfs having a single regulation type . we conclude that the higher reliability attributed to positive correlations is a phenomenon of the presence of significant number of tfs that act as either general activators or general repressors and that the co-expression to co-regulation pattern observed from the real expression skeletal muscle dataset is consistent with the presence of  <dig> to 80% of tfs having a bipotential activity . in agreement with our findings, while on a smaller scale, the recent work of ouyang et al.  <cit>  with mouse embryonic stem cells, revealed that a remarkably high proportion of variation in gene expression can be explained by the binding signals of  <dig> tfs of which  <dig>  serve as either activator or repressor depending on the target.

co-expression as a function of transcriptional regulatory motifs 
we used the log-odds ratio  to investigate the relationship between the co-expression correlation observed for genes pairs and the number of shared tfs. we observed that the lod-value is dependent on the type of transcriptional regulatory motifs  defining the motif of n common tfs jointly regulating the same set of tgs, and with n =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ... up to n ‚â•  <dig> . these results corroborated and, to a degree, formally validated our previous observation that gene pairs sharing tfbs showed an increased co-expression correlation . a similar result was observed for gene pairs sharing from more than  <dig> to more than  <dig> tfbss . again, the trend is more pronounced when only positive correlations are considered, in line with a higher reliability for positive correlations  <cit> . as expected, the distribution of the co-expression correlations for pairs of genes with trms of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> genes shows an increased bias to highly positive correlations with increased size of the trm . likewise, extreme positive correlations  are more frequent among high-order trms than extreme negative correlations  .

derivation of a tf network for bovine skeletal muscle
we found  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tfs whose tgs were enriched for genes encoding proteins involved in cell cycle, fat, immune, mitochondria, muscle/glycolysis, and the ribosome, respectively . we used the chi-square test of independence to ascertain if there exists an independent pairing assortment in the resulting network of  <dig> tf and  <dig> edges. the null hypothesis of independence was rejected  and we concluded that our module assignment of tfs provided information about the topology of the network.

*tfs in bold-face correspond to module-specific tfs that are significantly expressed in muscle .

**atf <dig>  neurog <dig> and meis <dig> are assigned to different modules depending on the statistical test employed, hypergeometric or odds ratio. for all other tfs, there was a perfect agreement between the two criteria .

the tf arrangements were further explored by converting them into a network . this approach assigned links between tfs predicted to regulate more common targets than expected by chance alone. in order to analyze the resulting network among  <dig> tf connected by  <dig>  edges, we focused on tf hubs in the context of the functionally coherent modules . in brief, we exploited the muscle-based co-expression modules of hudson et al.  <cit>  to determine if they represented a robust enough set of tgs to infer the regulation of the biological process in question using promoter data only. to illuminate the relationship between co-expression and the sharing of tgs among tfs, we explored the network that resulted from linking tf pairs with absolute co-expression correlation greater than  <dig>  and more than  <dig> tgs in common. this approach resulted in  <dig> tfs connected by  <dig> edges and with tgif <dig> as the hub of the network .

discussion
co-expression versus co-regulation and implications for skeletal muscle
the resulting non-linear pattern observed when relating the number of regulator partners and the number of tgs a given tf has  resonates with the recent findings of bhardwaj et al.  <cit>  for model organisms and humans and indicates that only a limited number of partners are required to regulate an increasing number of targets.

as co-expression correlation between a pair of tgs increases, so does the number of common tfs . importantly, this relationship continues to trend downwards in negatively co-expressed pairs of genes. our prior, and in hindsight na√Øve expectation, was that pairs of genes with extreme negative correlations would share a high number of tfs . our prior expectation was based on the redundancy mechanism by which one of two genes involved in the same process  suffices at any point in time. however, the observed trend could also be reasoned from a mechanistic standpoint such that in order for a gene pair to show a strong negative co-expression, then their regulators must be vastly different . to elucidate the most likely speculation, the exploration of various regulation types in the tf - tg relationship in terms of activation, repression or bi-potential, was warranted.

our analyses also revealed that as tfs have more tgs the ratio of correlation of the expression of the tfs with its tgs compared to all genes converges to one . this is consistent with the expectation that the more genes a tf regulates, the higher the likelihood that their expression will be also regulated by other tfs. an alternative explanation is that motifs comprised of a single tf regulating many tgs  can generate temporal programs of expression, in which tgs are activated one by one in a defined order  <cit> . such temporal order of expression would imply that, at any given time point, the tf - tg relationship could be observed only for some of the tgs.

pre-eminent among the top  <dig> tfs with the highest co-expression correlation with their predicted tgs are five hox genes . the myogenic regulatory factors  myod <dig>  myog, myf <dig> and myf <dig> are generally not as well-represented as we anticipated, although myog is in 18th place. treating the positive and negative correlations separately improves the representation of the mrf significantly, in that both myod <dig>  and myog  subsequently feature. we have previously determined that of the various mrf only myod <dig> and myog make it onto an "always correlated" network that joins genes exhibiting strong co-expression.

with a special focus on the promoter regions shared by the core muscle structural proteins we determined enrichment for tf predicted to regulate those  <dig> molecules designated as either "fast", "slow", "embryonic" and "other muscle structural" as listed in table  <dig> of hudson et al. <cit> . the strongest enrichment for this process corresponded to gene ontology term "response to retinoic acid", a feature shared by mzf <dig> , tgif <dig>  and mash <dig> . other tfs with strong hits included foxm <dig> , a generic cell cycle regulator. the presence of a cell cycle regulator is intriguing given that a key feature of cells progressing through the myogenic program is cell cycle arrest.

there was some evidence for enrichment of the tgf-Œ≤ signaling pathway, with predicted smad <dig> and smad <dig> binding sites featuring in the upstream regions of a number of targets. mzf <dig> has been reported to bind to fhl <dig>   <cit> , which in turn has been reported to signal via the smads  <cit> . expression of tgif <dig> is induced by tgf-Œ≤, has a predicted binding site upstream of mstn, and interacts with smad proteins  <cit> .

a tf network for bovine skeletal muscle
the p-matrix was subjected to hierarchical cluster analyses. this approach clustered tfs predicted to regulate common tgs, and tgs predicted to be regulated by common tfs. we observed a strong clustering of a set of hox genes , which also included the homeobox gene, uncx. this clustering probably relates to the simple fact that many of the hox genes are physical neighbors on the genome, formed by relatively recent gene duplication events. in this sense, they are a rare example of physical proximity and shared functionality in eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . we also observed a cluster of mitochondrial proteins including ndufa <dig> near cox6a <dig> and coxa <dig>  although given the size of the data this may have been expected by chance alone.

the impact on the functionally coherent modules
the lack of enrichment for the ribosome module is consistent with ribosomal proteins being ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and ribosomal rna accounting for ~60% of total rna in the cell  <cit> . overall, this approach enriched for some of the known, experimentally-validated regulators, with the cell cycle module performing particularly well. given our 'promoterome' approach was predicated on first screening for highly conserved cis-regulated modules across mammals, our particular success with the cell cycle may reflect the observation that the cell cycle is more evolutionary conserved than various other processes  <cit> . for example, the behavior of e2f <dig>  a causal regulator of cell cycle activity  <cit> , recapitulated both here and by high co-expression alone is conserved across groups including c. elegans and yeast.

in addition, amongst the module-specific and muscle-expressed tfs  we highlight arid5b and foxm <dig>  both with cell cycle genes significantly enriched among their targets. arid5b is a member of the at-rich interaction domain family of tfs, which are known to be critically involved in the regulation of development and cellular differentiation  <cit> . recent studies have reported a functional role for foxm <dig> in cell cycle  <cit>  and for nfkb <dig> in muscle  <cit> . interestingly, foxm <dig> expression is decreased after the induction of fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation by tgf-Œ≤  <cit> .

equally suggestive is the significant enrichment of genes from the mitochondrial module among the lists of predicted tgs for mef2c. van oort et al.  <cit>  showed that a subset of the genes activated by a dominant negative mef2c construct in mice encoded proteins localized primarily to, or functioning at, the level of mitochondria. in addition, rnai silencing of mef2c expression in the cardiac muscle of mice reduced mitochondrial dna levels  <cit> . the nuclear factor  <dig>  family of tfs includes nfix which has been found to act as a transcriptional switch from embryonic to fetal skeletal muscle development  <cit> .

only three tfs  changed module allocation depending on the criteria used . atf <dig> was allocated to cell cycle according to the hypergeometric test and to the fat module according to the odds ratio. atf <dig> is a master regulator of the unfolded regulator response and has been implicated the regulation of lipid metabolism  <cit> . however, in this work the regulation was via a protein-protein interaction with srebp <dig> without dna binding. similarly, meis <dig> was allocated to the muscle/glycolysis and to the immune module according to the hypergeometric and the odds ratio tests, respectively. meis <dig> belongs in the family of homeobox genes which play a crucial role in many developmental processes. a search of the literature indentified meis <dig> as a regulator of the immune system  <cit>  and myogenesis  <cit> .

gata-binding protein  <dig>  was among the tfs whose tgs were enriched for the fat module genes. tong et al.  <cit>  discovered that gata factors play a key role in adipogenesis by suppressing promoters of adipogenic factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma .

while the muscle module did not enrich for the mrfs, the presence of smad <dig> and smad <dig> does implicate the tgf-Œ≤ pathway, known to regulate muscle mass in mammals. the presence of hif1a, a hypoxia responsive tf, does seem reasonable in a module that contains many glycolysis genes i.e. an alternative energy conversion pathway used in the absence of enough oxygen availability.

a network linking the gli transcription factors with myf5
an additional correctly inferred regulator of the muscle/glycolysis module genes is gli <dig>  <cit> . inspired by the work of mcdermott et al.  <cit> , who showed that gli proteins directly control myf <dig> expression in mouse muscle progenitor cells, we used our tf network to determine the links between the gli tfs , and the myogenic regulatory factor myf <dig> . for comparison, figure 5b shows the network among the same tfs in human and based on funcoup tool  <cit> . in our landscape gli <dig> was directly linked to myf <dig>  with one gene in common, and gli <dig> was linked to myf <dig> via hnf4a. the association of gli <dig> and myf <dig> in the two datasets are based on quite different types of relationships; gli <dig> is required to activate the expression of myf <dig>  <cit> , whereas our analysis is based on the predicted co-regulation of target genes by gli <dig> and myf <dig>  the correspondence in the association between myf <dig> and gli <dig> also provides support that our approach is a useful addition to the toolbox of analysis methodologies to be used in the analysis of gene expression data.

CONCLUSIONS
this work represents the first genome-wide analysis linking tissue-specific co-expression patterns with cis-genomic logic in bovine, a non-model vertebrate. the main finding is that extensive promoter sharing between genes culminates in a detectable and robust co-expression signal, significantly above that which would be expected by chance alone. one pivotal implication is that a sizeable proportion of regulators acting as either activators or repressors, but not both, is needed in order to observe a relationship between co-expression and co-regulation. finally, we have shown that mining the relationship between promoter sharing and co-expression in the context of functionally coherent modules allows for the identification of key regulators of those modules.
