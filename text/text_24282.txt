BACKGROUND
plastids, the solar powered energy factories of phototrophic eukaryotes, either translate mrnas for their organelle-encoded genes or import nuclear-encoded proteins. in both cases, correct folding of proteins is managed by chaperones such as those of the groel family. these are an abundant class of chaperones, which are also found in mitochondria, hydrogenosomes and prokaryotes  <cit> . their importance and distribution has led to intensive investigation of their function, and has culminated in the 'molecular chaperon concept'  <cit> , which has strongly influenced current understanding of protein folding and assembly.

early genomics on the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and on plastid chromosomes of eukaryotes has highlighted a surprisingly varied distribution of genome locations for groel homologues amongst photosynthetic taxa  <cit> . synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> harbours two different groel genes, whereas only one is maintained in red algal plastomes and the plastid genome of the cyanelle. genes encoding groel have not been located within the sequenced genomes of chloroplasts in green algae and land plants, but two nuclear homologs of groel, the cpn60s, have been detected in the nuclear genome of chlamydomonas reinhardii and some land plants. in euglena gracilis, no groel gene has been identified  <cit> . the secondary endosymbionts of a cryptomonad  and also a diatom  are known to encode a single groel gene in their plastid, and it can be speculated that the presence of a single copy of groel may indicate the ancestral state in a primary endosymbiont  <cit> . interestingly, the nucleomorph genome of the cyptomonad guillardia theta harbours a groel homologue  <cit>  and a cpn60-like homologue has recently also been found in the nucleomorph genome of another secondary endosymbiont: the chlorarachniophyte bigelowiella natans . additionally, cpn60-like genes have recently been discovered in the nuclear genomes of other photosynthetic organisms: including in a red alga , a diatom , and plasmodium falciparum . with the exception of p. falciparum, the co-occurrence of two groel genes in the genomes of these recently sequenced organisms was predicted as necessary for maintaining chloroplast function  <cit> . we develop here a hypothesis for differential transfer and gene duplication that explains the distribution of groel homologues amongst the mulitple genomes of photosynthetic taxa. we discuss how these proteins may act as an important regulator for plastid functions.

RESULTS
substitution model selection
in all analyses, except analyses of the red/brown algal groel orthologues, an rttev model, that accommodated positional rate heterogeneity in some form was the model selected as best by prottest under the aic criterion. in the case of the groel orthologues in red/brown algae, we noted that small differences in the aic criterion separated a variety of different models. when an rtrev model was assumed, and positional rate heterogeneity was approximated by either a constant proportion of variable sites or a discrete gamma distribution of rate classes, we noticed that the optimal estimates for these parameters varied among evolutionary lineages . when a uniform rate distribution was assumed, pvar values ranged from  <dig>  variable sites  to  <dig>  variable sites . when pvar was set to  <dig>  alpha shape parameter values ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . we suggest that this degree of variation in parameter estimates for phylogenetic grouping of anciently diverged sequences is likely to reflect lineage specific differences in structural and functional constraints  <cit> . as such it is potentially problematic for phylogenetic reconstruction, since parallel increases in proportions of variable sites in different evolutionary lineages can sometimes induce a form of long branch attraction  <cit> .

evolutionary tree building
optimal phyml  trees showed similar topological relationships over a wide range of pvar values specified to accommodate positional rate heterogeneity. the robustness of phylogenetic relationships to sampling error was also found to be relatively stable, when evaluated using non-parametric bootstrapping . figure  <dig> shows the optimal unrooted phylogenetic tree built assuming an rtrev model with positional rate heterogeneity modelled with a discrete gamma distribution .

although, it contains more groel homologues than was available to wastl et al.  <cit> , our phylogenetic reconstruction here is nevertheless consistent with observations and inferences made by wastl et al.  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that  the groel <dig> like genes from the plastid genome of red algae/heterokonts and cryptophytes are most closely related to the cyanobacterial groel <dig> genes.  interestingly the cyanelle groel <dig> like homologue is somewhat intermediate between cyanobacterial and red algal/chromist groel1-like sequences, a finding that may reflect the cyanobacterial-like nature of this plastid.  the non-photosynthetic eubacterial groel sequences are arguably more similar to the groel <dig> sequences found in cyanobacteria. in any event, the groel <dig> orthologues in cyanobacteria are genetically more diverse than the groel <dig> sequences in the same taxa. these observations may suggest that groel <dig> orthologues represent an ancestral from of groel. however, our inference that structural/functional constraints differ amongst groel homologues, means that it is not possible to exclude other interpretations.  assuming the root of the tree joins the branch leading to the non-photosynthetic taxa, figure  <dig> places the gloeobacter "a" and "b" sequences as the ancestral forms of groel homologues in photosynthetic taxa.  in the nuclear genomes of a diatom , an alveolate , the higher plants and the nucleomorph genomes of a chlorarachniophyte , a cryptophyte  and a red algae  groel <dig> type sequences are found. in the case of higher plants, two forms of groel <dig> occur, and appear to represent forms of groel duplicated from an ancestral groel2-like sequence. inferences concerning the origin of this duplication are potentially problematic. a relatively high bootstrap value in figure  <dig>  suggests that it may have occurred prior to the divergence of plastids. however, potential long branch attraction problems concerning the placement of α and β cpn60-like sequences from eukaryotes make this conclusion tentative. gene duplication within the green lineage and differences in the functional/structural constraints of green α and β cpn60-like sequences might also explain the results observed although chlamydomonas reinhardtii cpn <dig> α and β sequences  are not included in our phylogenetic analysis shown in figure  <dig> . however, it is clear from other phylogenetic analyses  that this green alga contains the two forms of groel <dig> also present in higher plants.

discussion
hypotheses of origin
our phylogenetic reconstruction suggests a complex pattern of genome transfers, losses and duplications in the evolution of groel sequences from photosynthetic taxa. in the earliest cyanobacterial-like prokaryotes, the ancestral groel sequence appears to have duplicated to form an "a" and a "b" type sequence that is still present today in the genome of gloeobacter  <cit> . it appears that the "a"  and "b" forms have been inherited by most cyanobacteria, and also the endosymbiont involved in primary plastid endosymbiosis. during the process of endosymbiosis, the groel2-like orthologue has been transferred from the endosymbiont genome to the nuclear genome in heterokonts, red algae, green algae and high plants, and cryptophytes. we predict that this also will be true for haptophytes and glaucocystophytes. less certain may be prediction of the pattern of evolution in peridinin-containing dinoflagellates, which in other respects appear highly distinctive in their evolution  <cit> . an interesting observation is that cyanophora paradoxa, the molecular prototype of the glaucophytes, shows not only archaic features by encoding a groes in its plastid genome, but also by containing a groel <dig> sequence, somewhat intermediate in sequence identity between cyanobacterial and plastid encoded groel <dig> genes. in the case of the chlorophyte lineage, it appears that it has been the groel <dig> form that has been lost, and in chlamydomonas and higher plants, this has been replaced by a duplicated form of a groel2-like sequence. this situation may also be true for the endosymbiont of the chlorarachniophyte b. natans , since phylogenetic reconstructions, including those with partial chlamydomonas groel sequences , provide some support for bigelowiella and cpn60α containing taxa being most closely related . several investigations on the evolution of the plasmodium apicoplast indicate a red algal origin for this organelle  <cit> . if so, then based on the generalisations stated above, one would expect that the groel/cpn <dig> distribution should be similar to the situation found in heterokonts. additional duplications, of groel <dig> genes  have also occurred in some species of filamentous cyanobacteria and this observation is discussed in the following section.

groel proteins and protein folding
in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, and for which genome data is complete, two different forms of groel/cpn <dig> are known to exist. thus, at least two copies of the gene or protein seem to be necessary for a complete chaperon function. further, the importance of having two divergent forms of groel for protein folding is suggested from observations on groel sequences in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  where it has been observed that groel <dig> and groel <dig> respond differently to heat shock and light conditions  <cit> . an interesting speculation is that the number and genetic diversity of groel homologues reflects complexity of morphotype in cyanobacteria. this is suggested from comparison within filamentous cyanobacteria. those strains that harbour three groel genes exhibit complex developmental stages  whereas filamentous strains with a simpler morphotype, such as nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  harbour only two groel genes. further study is needed to evaluate whether particular groel homologues are specifically expressed in different developmental stages. interestingly, p. falciparum encodes one cpn <dig> gene, but no groel <dig> in the apicoplast genome. if phylogenetic inferences of a close relationship with red algae  <cit>  are correct, then this observation may reflect relaxed constraints for protein folding for proteins of the apicoplast, and this speculation is also worth further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
although, phylogenetic reconstruction of individual gene histories is inherently problematic for anciently diverged taxa  <cit>  phylogenetic reconstruction for groel homologues nevertheless provides a framework for developing understanding of genome-wide patterns of gene loss, relocation and multiple events of gene duplication. our results presented here support and extend the hypothesis of groel/cpn <dig> evolution by wastl et al.  <cit>  which suggests a pattern of differential serial gene transfer and gene duplication.
