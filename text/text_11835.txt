BACKGROUND
linkage and association analyses are two complementary strategies for the genetic dissection of complex quantitative traits. compared with each other, linkage mapping has relatively high power and a low false positive rate, whereas association mapping has relatively high resolution  <cit> . linkage mapping is the traditional approach for identifying quantitative trait locus . association mapping  was originally used in humans  <cit>  and animals  <cit>  and has been introduced to plants  <cit>  in recent years. very recently, joint linkage-association mapping strategies have been proposed to utilize each method  <cit> , including parallel mapping   <cit>  and integrated mapping , such as magic   <cit>  and nam   <cit> .

both the seed weight  and silique length  are important determinants of yield potential in rapeseed and are good targets for selection in breeding  <cit>  due to their high heritability  <cit> . the correlation between sw and sl has been investigated by many studies, but the directions of the coefficients were not consistent  <cit> . in general, an increase in silique length may lead to an increase in the source of matter  <cit> , which results in larger seeds. both sw and sl are quantitatively inherited, which are controlled by multiple qtls, mainly with additive effects  <cit> . only linkage analysis has been used for mapping qtls of sw and sl in rapeseed  <cit> , and no association analysis studies have been reported until now.

in particular, neither of the qtls for sw and sl has been fine mapped. following preliminary linkage mapping, the classical/traditional fine mapping strategy is based on the recombinant individuals screened from a large-scale nil -segregating population, which requires several rounds of successive backcrossing and self-crossing  and the genotyping of thousands of individuals  <cit> . thus, the traditional nil-based fine mapping approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive. as an alternative, because of its relatively high resolution, association mapping can be used for fine mapping. however, high-throughput genome-wide association analysis is unnecessary and wasteful for fine mapping one particular qtl of interest. to overcome these limitations, we proposed a combined linkage and regional association mapping strategy, which conducted association mapping at the specific genomic region of the target qtl that was identified by the preliminary linkage mapping.

in the current study, we used regional association mapping to validate and fine map two major sw and sl qtls on the a <dig> linkage group of rapeseed that were identified by the preliminary linkage mapping. in detail, the main objectives of this study were as follows:  preliminary mapping of the qtls for sw and sl using linkage analysis;  validation and fine mapping of the target major qtls using regional association analysis; and  determination of the genetic basis of the co-localization of sw and sl qtls using meta-, conditional and allelic effect analyses.

RESULTS
linkage mapping of the qtls for sw and sl
phenotypic variation of the parents and segregating populations across environments
the two parents, zhongshuang <dig> and no.  <dig>  differed significantly for sl but not sw in all the investigated environments . transgressive segregation was observed for all of the populations in all environments, indicating the presence of favorable alleles in both parents. both the sw and sl of the segregating populations showed normal or near-normal distributions , suggesting a quantitative inheritance pattern suitable for qtl identification. interestingly, swm  was higher than swb  by approximately 10% for both the parents and all of the populations in all environments, which was in agreement with a previous report  <cit> .

the analysis of variance indicated that the genotypic, environmental and genotype × environment effects were all extremely significant for both sw and sl . both sw and sl showed very high and similar heritability  and sl, respectively), which was generally consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

as expected, highly positive correlations were observed between swm, swb and sww in each experiment . a positive correlation between sw and sl was observed with moderate coefficients in almost all of the experiments .

genome-wide detection and meta-analysis of the qtls
a framework of the genetic linkage map containing  <dig> loci  was constructed, which covered a total of 1934 cm of the b. napus genome and had an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci. the segregation distortion of each locus was estimated by the goodness-of-fit test, and  <dig> loci  showed distorted segregation. the biased loci were distributed unevenly: most of them were located on a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> linkage groups, and the loci biased to the same parent tended to cluster together, which is a common phenomenon in b. napus <cit> . genome-wide qtl analysis was performed for sw and sl separately.

a total of  <dig> sw identified qtls  were detected . of these,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could be detected for main raceme, raceme branch and whole-plant thousand seed weight, respectively. these identified qtls explained  <dig>  -  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance . the meta-analysis integrated  <dig> overlapping identified qtls into  <dig> repeatable consensus qtls on the a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and c <dig> linkage groups . of these, five repeatable consensus qtls were integrated from different tissues in the same experiment , and the remaining five were integrated from different experiments . of the five experiment-repeatable consensus qtls, cqsw.a01- <dig> and cqsw.a <dig> were detected in two environments , cqsw.a <dig> and cqsw.a09- <dig> were detected in three environments , and only one consensus qtl, cqsw.a09- <dig>  was consistently detected in all four environments .

a total of  <dig> sl identified qtls  were detected . these identified qtls explained  <dig>  -  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance . the meta-analysis integrated  <dig> overlapping identified qtls into three repeatable consensus qtls on the a <dig> and c <dig> linkage groups . of the three experiment-repeatable consensus qtls, cqsl.a09- <dig> was detected in two environments , cqsl.c <dig> was detected in three environments , and only cqsl.a09- <dig> was detected in all four environments .

the consensus qtls for sw and sl were subjected to meta-analysis again, which resulted in  <dig> unique qtls . of these, three unique qtls, uq.a09- <dig>  uq.a09- <dig> and uq.c02- <dig> were responsible for both sw and sl. specially, uq.a09- <dig>  and uq.a09- <dig>  were located on the a <dig> linkage group, with opposite additive-effect directions for both sw and sl.

“+”, “-” and “±” indicate the direction of the additive effect.

to determine the genetic basis of three unique qtls for both sw and sl , conditional qtl analysis was performed . when sw  was conditioned by sl , none of the three loci  remained significant for sw in all experiments; when sl was conditioned by sw , these loci were not significant for sl in half of the experiments. these results strongly suggested that pleiotropy, rather than tight linkage was likely to be the genetic cause of the three unique qtls for both sw and sl, and that sw was possibly contributed by sl for these loci.

regional association mapping
ssr  markers used for association mapping
the corresponding genomic regions of two major unique qtls  were identified by the alignment between the primer sequences of tightly linked ssr markers  and the genomic sequences of b. napus  and b. rapa <cit>  due to the macro-colinearity between the a genomes of b. rapa and b. napus <cit> . in total,  <dig> and  <dig> ssr markers  within the corresponding genomic regions of the two qtls were newly synthesized. of these, both six primer pairs were polymorphic between the two parents in the linkage mapping, and five and three ssr markers were selected for each locus for the association mapping. to screen more ssr markers for association mapping, the mini-core germplasms  were used to screen the polymorphisms for the other ssr markers , and we obtained three and six polymorphic primer pairs for the two unique qtls .

regional association mapping
a large range of phenotypic variations was observed  for both sw  and sl  in the association population. a significant weak correlation  was observed between sw and sl.

in this study, the 95th percentile of the r <dig> distribution for unlinked markers  determined the background level of ld . the extent of the ld decay was evaluated using linked markers . the ld decay decreased within  <dig>  mb over the whole genome and within  <dig>  mb on the a <dig> linkage group. in particular, the extent of the ld decay for the target qtl region  was  <dig>  mb .

considering the population structure  and family relatedness  within the population, the association analysis was conducted with a mixed linear model  by tassel  <dig>  using the 576-line sets and  <dig> qtl-linked ssr loci in the target region . notably, six and eight of the  <dig> loci on the a <dig> linkage group  with lower p-values  were identified for sw and sl, respectively. scanning of the association of sw and sl with the  <dig> loci on the a <dig> linkage group generally displayed two obvious peaks , which corresponded to the abovementioned two unique qtls, uq.a09- <dig> and uq.a09- <dig>  within the first peak, the marker brgms <dig> showed the strongest association for both sw  and sl  and was very near to brsf6- <dig>  the nearest marker for uq.a09- <dig>  within the second peak, the marker brsf6- <dig> showed the strongest association signal for both sw  and sl  and was near to brsf <dig>  the nearest marker for uq.a09- <dig>

to determine the resolution of this association study, the extent of the ld around the best associated ssr markers  was investigated. as expected, this region was divided into two ld blocks  <cit> . eight and seven markers showed significant ld with brgms <dig> and brsf6- <dig>  respectively . of these, bnsf566- <dig> and brsf6- <dig> displayed significant ld with both brgms <dig> and brsf6- <dig>  but their r <dig> values were relatively lower than those of the other markers, which likely represented the overlapping region of the two ld blocks. the first ld block around the marker brgms <dig> extended roughly from brsf <dig>  to brsf6- <dig> , indicating a resolution of approximately 1 cm . another ld block around the marker brsf6- <dig> extended roughly from brsf6- <dig>  to brsf <dig> , indicating a resolution of approximately  <dig>  cm .

conditional analysis
to determine the genetic basis  of the common association markers for sw and sl, conditional analysis was performed using two methods. the first method used the conditional phenotypic values, while the second method used one trait as a covariate for the other, to perform the association analysis. the results showed that the p value and r <dig> of the association markers showed great variation before and after the conditional analysis using both methods . taking one of the peak signal markers, brgms <dig>  as an example, regardless of whether sw was conditioned by sl  or sl was conditioned by sw , both showed a strongly reduced effect . this result indicated that the genetic basis of common association markers for sw and sl was likely to be pleiotropy rather than tight linkage.

allelic effects of the three pairs of co-localized sw and sl qtls in the linkage and association populations
the allelic effects of the co-localized sw and sl qtls in the linkage and association populations were estimated using the phenotypic values of the different genotypes for the nearest marker . the results showed that for all of the haplotypes of the three co-localized sw and sl qtls , their allelic effects for sw were highly accordant with those for sl in both the linkage and association populations. for example, the corresponding phenotypic values of the three major haplotypes  of the marker brsf6- <dig>  for sw and sl were  <dig>  g and  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  g and  <dig>  mm, and  <dig>  g and  <dig>  mm, respectively. this finding increased the likelihood that pleiotropy rather than tight linkage was the underlying genetic basis for the three pairs of co-localized sw and sl qtls.

discussion
in the present study, we proposed a combined linkage and regional association mapping strategy to directly fine map target major qtls. using this strategy, the confidence intervals of the two major qtls on the a <dig> linkage group were narrowed to approximately 1/ <dig> of those in the preliminary linkage mapping . our results suggested that this strategy is effective for direct fine mapping after preliminary linkage analysis. compared with the traditional/classical nil-based fine mapping approach  <cit> , this strategy does not require the development and genotyping of a large-scale nil segregating populations and is time- and labor-saving. in addition, our strategy can be applied to all plant species, especially those lacking high-density genome-wide genetic markers.

in previous genetic and qtl mapping studies, seed weight was usually measured separately from the main raceme , branch raceme   <cit>  and whole plant   <cit> . in the present work, swm, swb and sww were all measured for both the genetic and qtl analyses. strikingly, swm showed an extremely high correlation with both swb  and sww , and most of the qtls identified for swm, swb and sww were consistent. however, swm is more easily measured than swb and sww. we therefore suggested the measurement of swm rather than swb and sww in futher studies.

in the previous linkage qtl mapping studies, approximately  <dig> and  <dig> qtls have been identified for sw  <cit>  and sl  <cit> , respectively, which were distributed on all and  <dig> of the  <dig> total linkage groups. most of these qtls showed relatively small effects, with only three major qtls  <cit> : two on the a <dig> linkage group for sw and one on the a <dig> linkage group for both sw and sl. of the  <dig> sw and  <dig> sl consensus qtls identified in the current linkage and association mapping studies, two  and three , respectively, have also been confirmed by the previous studies. the currently identified consensus qtls, cqsw.a <dig>  cqsl.c <dig> and cqsl.c02- <dig>  likely corresponded with tswa7a, sl <dig> and qsl.n <dig>  respectively, which were detected in one of the previous studies and are located around the common markers brms <dig>  <cit> , cb <dig>  <cit>  and cb <dig>  <cit> , respectively. the consensus qtls, cqsw.a09- <dig> and cqsl.a09- <dig>  were very close  to the cqswa <dig> and cqsla <dig> qtls, respectively, which were identified in a previous study  <cit> . in addition, six sw qtls have also been identified repeatedly around the markers cb <dig>  <cit> , mr <dig>  <cit> , sr0282r  <cit> , cb <dig>  <cit> , na12e <dig>  <cit>  and ni4a <dig>  <cit>  on a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> linkage groups, respectively, according to various previous studies. these “repeatable” qtls found across the current and previous studies should be potential targets for marker-assisted selection. the four sw and two sl major qtls found across these studies would be the important targets for map-based cloning. these results showed that both sw and sl were controlled by a large number of loci, mostly with small effects, which strongly suggested the complexity of the genetic basis of both traits.

the allotetraploid b. napus  was derived from chromosome doubling after the recent  natural hybridization between its two diploid ancestors, b. rapa  and brassica oleracea   <cit> . the previous comparative genomics studies showed that although most of the homoeologous a genome linkage groups/chromosomes of b. rapa and b. napus showed co-linearity  <cit> , some small-scale genomic changes also existed, including translocations  <cit> , insertion/deletions, inversions and rearrangements  <cit> . in the current study, a large fragment inversion was also revealed by the comparison between the b. napus linkage map and the b. rapa physical map of the qtl interval of uq.a09- <dig> and uq.a09- <dig> , which was also consistent with the previous comparative genomics studies  <cit> . these results explained the inconsistency between the large genetic distance  of uq.a09- <dig> and uq.a09- <dig> in b. napus and the close physical distance  in b. rapa.

the estimated genome-wide ld decay of the current b. napus association population was  <dig>  mb, which corresponds with approximately  <dig>  cm  <cit>  and was slightly higher than those estimated  in previous studies on rapeseed  <cit> . the estimated ld decay on the a <dig> linkage group was  <dig>  mb, corresponding with  <dig>  cm, which was very near that on the whole genome in our study and was slower than that  estimated for the same linkage group in a previous study  <cit> . however, the ld decay of the target qtl interval  was faster than those of the a <dig> linkage group and the whole genome. this observation suggested that the qtl region should be within a recombination hotspot, which was consistent with its location on the end of the a <dig> pseudo-chromosome and linkage group, most likely corresponding with the peri-telomere. this result also indicated that the target qtls could be fine mapped through ld mapping with the current association population.

from the linkage and association analyses, a total of three co-localized sw and sl qtls were identified, with the same additive-effect direction, which agreed with the significantly and moderately positive correlations in both populations. in fact, the co-localization of the sw and sl qtls was also commonly observed in other previous studies  <cit> . however, the underlying genetic basis  has not yet been studied intensively. interestingly, the allelic effect, conditional and meta-analyses of the three co-localized qtls all supported that pleiotropy rather than tight linkage was likely to be the underlying genetic basis in the current study. in addition, thousand seed weight of the f <dig> lines with extremely large  and small  seeds were in high accordance with the silique length of the corresponding lines . thus, the variations in sw might be primarily affected by those in the sl in the current linkage population, which is in accordance to the abovementioned conditional analysis for the three co-localized qtls for both sw and sl. this finding is understandable because long siliques enable an increased photosynthesis area and assimilation, thereby providing the basis for the increase in the sw, and implicating maternal control of the underlying gene   <cit> . therefore, relevant genes within the genomic regions of the two major pleiotropic qtls for sl rather than sw should be chosen as the preferential candidates. these results shed new light on the screening of candidate genes underlying complex quantitative traits: which one is the causal or the intermediate trait for complex trait?

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we proposed a regional association mapping strategy to directly fine map the target qtls identified in preliminary linkage mapping. compared with the traditional/classical nil-based fine mapping strategies, our approach has many advantages, for example, it is time-saving, labor-saving and cost-effective. using this strategy, the confidence intervals of the two major qtls for both sw and sl on the a <dig> linkage group were successfully narrowed to a large extent, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy. interestingly, the meta-, conditional and allelic effect analyses all suggest that pleiotropy, rather than tight linkage, was the genetic basis of the three unique qtls for both sw and sl. furthermore, the variations in sl are more likely to be the cause of the variation in sw, not vice versa. these results provide a solid basis for candidate gene screening and further gene cloning. in addition, several sw and/or sl qtls identified by the current linkage mapping appeared to be “repeatable” in previous studies and could be the potential targets for marker-assisted selection in rapeseed breeding.
