BACKGROUND
spirulina  platensis is a filamentous non-n2-fixing cyanobacterium that has become important as a source for commercially produced nutraceutical compounds, as this cyanobacterium utilizes sunlight and co <dig> to produce chemical compounds that are essential for life. spirulina has been consumed as a protein source for many years by north africans and mexicans  <cit>  because it contains high amounts of healthy nutritional molecules such as beta-carotene, phycocyanin, vitamins, trace minerals, and polyunsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . recently this cyanobacterium has played an important role in a wide range of applications in the nutraceutical industry, including human food supplements and animal feed  <cit> . moreover, many scientific articles have reported the therapeutic benefits of this microorganism, such as helping to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes  <cit> . furthermore, s. platensis is potentially one of the algae capable of producing bioenergy and renewable energy, which could help to decrease the effects of global-warming  <cit> . among the diverse range of cyanobacterial species, s. platensis is capable of growing in outdoor environments at a high rate  <cit> . in terms of cellular capacities, many of its bioactive compounds could be inexpensively produced by photosynthesis. these facts plus its nutritional value make s. platensis an attractive photobiological cell factory.

the growing availability of genomic sequences and software technologies has made it possible to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic networks of various organisms. genome-scale metabolic models come from the systematic reconstruction of all cellular biochemical reactions according to the genetic information of a given organism  <cit> . a vast number of applications of a reconstructed metabolic network have been reported and include such possibilities as genome annotation and metabolic engineering  <cit> . knowledge of the presence or absence of specific pathways in a given organism can help to improve the quality of genome annotation  <cit> . furthermore, after the metabolic pathways are initiated, this reconstructed metabolic network becomes a useful tool for applications in the area of metabolic engineering, the general goal of which is to redistribute fluxes within a metabolic network towards a desired goal  <cit> . reconstruction of the metabolic network is also necessary for in silico predictions of gene functions and the metabolic capabilities of an organism  <cit> . by applying flux balance analysis  technique  <cit> , the metabolic network may be converted to a genome-scale model, allowing a qualitative assessment of the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic behaviors, and a global estimation of flux distributions within the metabolism of an organism, which cannot possibly be measured using a standard experimental design. currently, one popular tool for investigating complex stoichiometric metabolic models is the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis  toolbox  <cit>  with matlab. this technique relies on linear programming  and a given set of various appropriate constraint parameters known from experiments. numerous successes have been reported using these methods as the tools to elucidate in silico models   <cit> .

various genome-scale metabolic models of many organisms are currently available  <cit> . however, of cyanobacterium, only synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> has been developed by independent research teams around the world  <cit> . each proposed model provides informative knowledge on rational bioenergy production by synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> as a photobiological cell factory. with such an impressive advantage of s. platensis, especially as a nutraceutical, as previously mentioned, s. platensis has become one of the preferred choices for a sustainable photobiological cell factory. unfortunately, there have only been a limited number of attempts to computationally analyze the metabolism of spirulina. a simple metabolic flux model of s. platensis consisting of  <dig> reactions was proposed by meechai et al <cit> . this model was used to predict rate limiting enzymes for the production of gamma-linolenic acid. a larger metabolic network of s. platensis comprising  <dig> reactions and  <dig> metabolites was formulated by cogne and his team  <cit> . this model accounted for central metabolic pathways, anaplerotic reactions, energy metabolism reactions, anabolic reactions, synthesis of macromolecules, biomass and growth-associated exopolysaccharides . however, these two models did not provide the whole-cell characteristics and metabolic capabilities of s. platensis. recently, the genome sequence of s. platensis c <dig> became available  <cit> , together with an increasing number of studies of its physiological and molecular levels. these data have enabled a genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction of s. platensis.

this paper presents the first genome-scale metabolic model of s. platensis , representing global growth behaviors under three different growth conditions: autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic. the metabolic network is based on the s. platensis c <dig> genome, a collective knowledge base, and extensive manual curation. computational simulation was performed using cobra toolbox  <cit> . the results from in silico predictions were further validated with experimental evidence. various analyses of the iak <dig> model were performed to identify active reactions and essential genes under each growth condition. moreover, phenotypic phase plane   <cit>  analysis was carried out to predict the metabolic states of iak <dig> during autotrophic and mixotrophic growths. the iak <dig> model not only provides further physiological knowledge of the cellular system, but is also a valuable platform for integrating multilevel “-omics” data, which could provide further insight towards increasing the number of desired industrial bioproducts from spirulina.

RESULTS
metabolic model reconstruction
reconstruction of a draft model
in order to build a genome-scale metabolic model of s. platensis c <dig>  the genome-scale metabolic network was reconstructed according to a series of extensive refinements . the genome of s. platensis c <dig> is deposited in the genbank database   <cit> . the estimated genome size for the  <dig> dna scaffolds is approximately  <dig>  mb. a total of  <dig>  open reading frames  were predicted;  <dig>  orfs  were well annotated with gene functions; and  <dig>  orfs  were identified as putative or hypothetical proteins . reconstruction of the model was initiated with automated construction using pathway tools software  <cit> . using this fully computational procedure, a draft metabolic network, called the “draft model”, was generated based on the annotated genome data. this automated process facilitates the top-down reconstruction approach, giving an overview network and visualization; therefore, it provides the maximum possible number of pathways, each of which has different numbers of reactions and genes.

the pathway tools software  <cit>  predicts the metabolic network for s. platensis c <dig> based on the gene name or ec number matching method. this preliminary model accounted for  <dig> pathway frames ,  <dig> genes corresponding to  <dig>  biochemical reactions, and  <dig>  metabolites. a summary of the draft model is shown in table  <dig>  the pathways were also predicted and a large number of the pathway reactions were obtained. we also found that one gene could participate in more than one reaction of different pathways. thus, this process built  <dig> candidate pathways and  <dig> out of  <dig>  reactions were presented and showed no gene association. however, the quality of the predicted large-scale reconstructed network depends on the quality of the initial annotated data. furthermore, the reconstructed network must express the biology and physiology of s. platensis c1; for instance, whether or not the predicted pathways or reactions present in s. platensis c <dig> and the numbers of incomplete pathways  indicate a disconnection in the network. hence, manual-intensive curation was subsequently performed to increase the accuracy of the draft auto-generated network.

metabolic network refinement
biochemical information about cyanobacteria was obtained from the literature and biochemistry textbooks, and online biochemical databases were used to research several iterative methods of reconstruction and were used to refine the draft model; this is referred to as the “refined model”. in more detail, the predicted pathways/reactions that have not been reported for spirulina physiology, such as cholesterol biosynthesis i, ii, and iii pathways, were eliminated from the network. pathway tools mapped only one gene, crtb, encoding phytoene synthase, onto two reactions out of twenty-two reactions in these pathways for the draft model. however, we found that the phytoene synthase enzyme was involved in the presence of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. since carotenoid is an important molecule in photosynthesis, the synthesis pathway of this compound was retained.

then the blast algorithm  <cit>  and the tool for the protein domain prediction against pfam databases  <cit>  were used to determine the enzymatic gene functions needed to complete the pathways where no gene could be found in the automated metabolic reconstruction. a total of  <dig> genes were annotated and added to the network. missing reactions  that resulted in dead-end metabolites and prevented the computational simulation of cell growth were identified and filled in. this procedure was continued until all of the biomass components in table  <dig> were included. after manually updating the gap filling process, we also attempted to search for the genes in the genome, which can be associated with the added reactions. a total of  <dig> reactions from closely related organisms were added to complete the connectivity of the network. the refined model contains  <dig> metabolic genes,  <dig> metabolites, and  <dig> biochemical reactions . the number of many-to-many relationships between reactions and genes presented in the network is  <dig> reactions.

generation of the computational genome-scale model 
in order to make the computation-ready model, referred to as the “final model”, the balance between each element, including metabolites and protons , reaction directionality, transport reaction, and the completely characterized biomass equation were curated and added to the refined model. we checked the balance of protons in a reaction and also found that different databases contain some contradictory information. in this reconstruction, we used metacyc  <cit>  as the key reference for h+ balancing. additionally, the stoichiometry and reversibility of the reactions were manually verified and assisted by biochemical reaction databases such as kegg  <cit>  and brenda  <cit> . we also considered the direction of the reaction on the basis of thermodynamics. if the reaction consumed high-energy compounds such as atp, the reaction was designated irreversible. considering only the internal reactions of the model, there are  <dig> irreversible and  <dig> reversible reactions. the cofactors, i.e, nadph, and nadh involved in the reactions were manually curated based on information from literature  <cit>  and the published genome-scale model of synchocystis sp. pcc <dig>  <cit> . the system boundary was defined across the cytoplasmic membrane and environment in terms of transport reactions. diffusion was assumed to be the mechanism for transporting nutrients between cytoplasm and extracellular environment. thus, transporter genes were not assigned in this first large-scale model of s. platensis. instead, a total of  <dig> exchange reactions were included in the model to ensure that organic nutrient metabolites , inorganic nutrient metabolites , gaseous metabolites , photons, and water could enter and leave the system in response to the physiological state. we are aware that the transport mechanisms across the cell membrane should be considered in this study because of their possible effect on the model. this is an issue that we will address in a future study.

in order to determine the capability of a genome-scale model, the most popularly used objective function in fba is normally the biomass objective function . a biomass equation represents all necessary precursors that form the cellular biomass. thus,  <dig> reactions with no gene association were added for the synthesis of intermediate macromolecules, i.e. proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, rna, dna, and chlorophyll, which are considered to form the major composition of biomass. the biomass formation equations were obtained based on data from different sources of experimental efforts for s. platensis under autotrophic conditions  <cit>  . moreover, the net reaction for all light-dependent reactions was obtained from a previous report  <cit> . all reactions in the reconstructed metabolic network are listed and shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

the different methods of reconstruction resulted in the final model, iak <dig>  and account for  <dig> metabolic genes,  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> exchange reactions, and  <dig> internal biochemical reactions, including  <dig> gene-associated reactions and  <dig> with no gene association . a total of  <dig> reactions included in the model were designated as belonging to the high level of metabolism . the functional classification of the orfs included in the reconstruction is summarized in figure 2b, based on the enzyme commission  number  <cit> . the majority of orfs are associated with the transferase enzyme .

network topology of iak692
the structural organization of iak <dig> was characterized by an analysis of metabolic connectivity via reactions within the network. most of the metabolites in the network have few connections, whereas a few metabolites participate in a large number of reactions. the top  <dig> most highly connected metabolites are atp, adp, phosphate, diphosphate, nadp, nadph, co <dig>  nad, nadh, and o <dig>  these frequently used metabolites were found to be involved in energy metabolism, such as atp and adp, and in redox metabolism, such as nadph and nadp . these metabolic hubs serve as key compounds related to the core metabolism of the organism in transferring specific biochemical groups such as phosphate groups, redox equivalents, amino groups and acetyl groups. in addition, connectivity was compared to other genome-scale models, including synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>   <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit> , and yeast   <cit> . it was found that iak <dig> has a similar network topology and metabolite hub to these models . it should also be noted that these metabolites are involved in energy and redox metabolism, representing the currency of biological life. the topology also indicates that in the organization of the network a few hubs dominate the overall connectivity of the network and the network eventually disintegrates into isolated clusters. these characters show to what degree different components of the cellular metabolism are interconnected. perturbations in cellular behavior, such as changing a few fluxes in metabolism, can affect the entire metabolism. hence, studying the structural organization of the network provides hints for discovering corresponding regulatory mechanisms of the cell.

validation of iak692
s. platensis c <dig> naturally grows under autotrophic conditions using carbon dioxide as a carbon source and converting light as cellular energy, like other cyanobacteria. several strains of these microalgae, including s. platensis, were recently researched for their potential to grow under heterotrophic and mixotrophic environments  <cit> . however, there have been no reports of either mode of cultivation in the s. platensis strain c <dig>  thus, we investigated the cellular properties of heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth in order to gain more basic physiological knowledge of s. platensis c <dig>  subsequently, we validated the reconstructed metabolic network by comparing the predicted results from in silico simulations with the experimental results. the measured maximum specific growth rates of s. platensis c <dig> under the three growth conditions are summarized in table  <dig>  more details of the results are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

* data from ref.  <dig> 

** data from ref.  <dig> 

the basic capabilities of iak <dig> were evaluated based on constraint-based modeling using the fba technique  <cit>  to quantitatively predict growth under the three metabolic modes. assuming a steady state, fba simulates the mass balance of all metabolites derived from the stoichiometric reactions together with constraints and the objective function. in this study, we set the biomass flux as the objective function.

for autotrophic growth, cells synthesize organic molecules for biomass formation from inorganic compounds and sunlight. the maximum specific growth rate of s. platensis c <dig> was demonstrated in batch cultivation . the uptake rates of the main metabolites, bicarbonate and phosphate, were measured and used as the constraints of the simulation. in order to assess the predictive potential of the model, we simulated the in silico model based on minimal media consumption, as shown in table  <dig>  the constraints of certain metabolite uptake rates were obtained from the literature  <cit> . the photon flux was set to be between zero and  <dig> μeinstein/m2/s with a fixed uptake rate of  <dig>  mmol/mmol dry cell/h of bicarbonate. the results show that the maximum in silico-specific growth rate was similar to the maximum specific growth rate measured from the experiments. the experimentally determined value and the computationally predicted value were  <dig>  and  <dig>  1/h, respectively. on the other hand, when the photon flux was omitted , the in silico cell could not grow . in the simulation, we set the glucose uptake rate equal to  <dig>  mmol/mmol dry cell/h with no light. the predicted value of growth was zero , showing an agreement between in vivo and in silico conditions. considering the genomic data, s. platensis c <dig> has the hex gene encoding the hexokinase enzyme, which converts glucose molecules into glucose-6-phosphate. this is the first important step in the glycolysis pathway, which allows cells to metabolize glucose as a carbon source. however, a lack of the ability to utilize sugar in the dark was recently reported in some strains of spirulina <cit> . therefore, this agreement in the results may stem from no or a loss of function of the gene product when growing for a long period of time under autotrophic conditions in the laboratory. moreover, the glucose concentration had no effect on the growth of s. platensis under the heterotrophic conditions reported in a previous study  <cit> .

in the mixotrophic mode with carbon dioxide and glucose as carbon sources and light as the energy source, the measured growth rate under this condition was found to be slightly higher than that of the autotrophic mode . the model simulation under mixotrophic conditions also showed a higher growth rate , although to a different extent. interestingly, this growth rate corresponds to that of an increase in biomass formation during the mixotrophic cultivation of another spirulina strain by lodi and his team  <cit> . they suggested that the mixotrophic culture had the highest growth rate because the heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolism processes might be active in parallel. however, the current experimental study for s. platensis c <dig> has showed that the mixotrophic growth rate  is only slightly higher than the autotrophic growth rate  . we also modeled the hex gene knockout that results in zero flux of this reaction. the results show that the growth rate decreased from  <dig>  1/h to  <dig>  1/h . therefore, the different growth behaviors found for the different physiological properties and in silico predictions might require further experimental verification in order to discover further explanations and make new discoveries. all profiles of the flux distributions of the three growth conditions are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

reaction activity and flux variability analyses
the result validation demonstrates that the in vivo growth rates of iak <dig> are consistent with the experimental growth rates found under the three different modes. in order to investigate the flux distributions in terms of active reactions, this model was only used for the simulation of autotrophic and mixotrophic growths because the cells failed to grow under heterotrophic conditions. the flux results show that iak <dig> had  <dig>  and  <dig>  active reactions under the autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions, respectively. these two numbers of active reactions are close to those found in previous studies of other genome-scale models such as those for clostridium beijerinckii <cit> , e. colistaphylococcus aureushelicobacter pylori and yeast  <cit> , which comprise around  <dig> active reactions. for a more precise determination of active reactions in each growth condition, we performed flux variability analysis   <cit>  to determine possible ranges of fluxes of all reactions that still satisfy the same optimal growth. here, we classify the reaction activity into  <dig> categories based on the fva results:  a reaction is considered “always active” if min/max flux values are non-zero with the same sign,  a reaction is considered “sometimes active” if the range of possible fluxes contains zeroes, and  a reaction is considered “never active” if min/max flux values are equal to zero during optimal growth. to satisfy the optimal autotrophic growth, we found that  <dig>  reactions are always active;  <dig>  reactions are sometimes active, and  <dig>  reactions are never active . on the other hand, to achieve its optimum growth in mixotrophic condition  <dig>  reactions are always active;  <dig>  are sometimes active, and  <dig>  are never active for the s. platensis . it is noted that there is a total of  <dig> and  <dig> “active reactions”  for autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions, respectively. it was observed that all the  <dig> reactions found active under the autotrophic growth are also active under the mixotrophic growth. the six remaining reactions that are found active only under the mixotrophic growth are shown in table  <dig>  these reactions belong to the pathways involving glucose exchange, glycolysis, arginine and proline metabolism, and cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis. we think that these pathways are necessary for the conversion of external glucose to intermediates in the synthesis of macromolecules needed for mixotrophic cell growth. all profiles of fva of both growth conditions are presented in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

metabolic gene essentiality analysis
the capacity of iak <dig> for predicting the growth behavior when it suffers gene deletion was evaluated. like many other constraint-based models  <cit> , the iak <dig> model contains a list of gene-protein-reaction interactions indicating which genes are connected with each reaction in the metabolic network. the essentiality of each gene can be determined by constraining its associated reaction not to carry flux. therefore, the network reaction associated with each gene was deleted, one by one, by setting both the upper and lower bounds of a reaction to zero and optimizing for the biomass formation. in this study, the iak <dig> model accounting for  <dig> biochemical reactions and  <dig> metabolites was employed to identify the essential genes for survival under autotrophic and mixotrophic growth conditions using the moma platform  <cit> . it was found that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were essential for the growth of iak <dig> under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions, respectively . a list of these essential genes can be found in the additional file 4: table s <dig>  the total number of  <dig> essential genes for the mixotrophy was about 19 %  of the total genes. this number is close to those found in other published models -- 15 %  in e. coli   <cit> , and 10 %  in yeast   <cit> . it is noted that there were  <dig> common essential genes between the two growth conditions. these common genes can be considered core metabolic genes for the growth of iak <dig>  fig.  <dig> also shows a list of unique essential genes for each growth condition. not surprisingly, the unique essential genes for autotrophy were the genes associated with the calvin cycle and gluconeogenesis pathways that are responsible for photosynthesis and glucose formation, respectively.

phenotypic phase plane analysis
phenotypic phase plane  analysis is a useful approach for examining the steady-state solution space when two variables of interest are varied  <cit> . we employed phpp to demonstrate the effect of light and bicarbonate ions on the growth of iak <dig> under autotrophic condition. within the metabolic network, inorganic carbon was transported from the medium as bicarbonate ions into cells. the intracellular bicarbonate was then dehydrated via carbonic anhydrase enzyme to become co <dig>  the intensity of light input was represented by absorbed photon flux . the surface of a three-dimensional phpp corresponding to the predicted maximal growth rate as a function of the photon flux  and the bicarbonate uptake rate  was plotted a. it was found that the cells exhibited distinct phenotypes depending on the amounts of bicarbonate and light fluxes. it is apparent that the cell growth rate is zero in region i where the apf is below  <dig> μeinstein/m2/s. it is possible that there is not enough light intensity to generate sufficient amount of atp required for cell growth in this region. at the apf between  <dig> and  <dig> μeinstein/m2/s , the maximal growth was found to be linearly dependent on both the absorbed light and bicarbonate availability. at the apf above  <dig> μeinstein/m2/s , the cell growth is limited by the bicarbonate ion availability. it is noteworthy to mention that our model fails to describe the photoinhibition at high apfs, although it has been well documented that photoinhibition is observed in autotrophic cultures of spirulina. this is another issue that we will address in a future study.

furthermore, phpp for the case of iak <dig> grown under varying bicarbonate and glucose uptake rates in the presence of constant apf  was performed to investigate the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration growth of iak <dig> during mixotrophy. the phpp plot shows three distinct regions describing different growth phenotypes . in region i where the glucose uptake flux equals zero, iak <dig> is able to grow using bicarbonate ion as a sole carbon source via photosynthetic pathways. this region can be characterized as autotrophy. in region ii, the optimal growth of iak <dig> was linearly dependent on both bicarbonate and glucose uptake fluxes. however, such dependency does not exist at high uptake rates as the carbon nutrients become saturated. both photosynthetic and respiratory pathways are active in this region. in region iii, we observed that iak <dig> fails to grow in the absence of bicarbonate ion regardless of the amount of glucose availability. this implies that the respiratory pathways in the iak <dig> strain could be triggered only if the photosynthetic pathways are active during the mixotrophic growth.

CONCLUSIONS
herein, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic network of the cyanobacterium s. platensis c <dig>  which is valuable both scientifically and economically. the network was constructed using i) automatic reconstruction by pathway tools software  <cit> ; and ii) iterative processes of extensive manual curation based on genomic and bibliome data . the curated network accounts for  <dig> metabolic genes,  <dig> metabolites, and  <dig> reactions. more than 85 % of the total reactions were associated with genes.

we used the cobra toolbox  <cit>  to investigate the global metabolic capability of s. platensis c <dig>  this approach allowed an estimation of the flux distribution of the entire metabolism. the simulated results were validated by experimental evidence and showed satisfactory agreement under three different growth conditions; namely, autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic. analyses of the iak <dig> model enabled us to gain insights into the metabolic phenotypes and essential genes of s. platensis c <dig> grown under these conditions. with a growing spirulina community, the proposed model would not only be useful for studying cellular phenotypes but it could also serve as a platform for “-omics” data integration in order to achieve the beneficial stage of model-driven discovery in spirulina systems biology  <cit> .
