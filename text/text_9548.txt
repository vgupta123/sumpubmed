BACKGROUND
most proteins do not perform their function without undergoing some form of post translational modification   <cit> . ptms occur after the mrna has been translated into peptide sequence and the polypeptide has begun to fold  <cit> . the importance of ptms in protein function makes their characterisation of particular interest  <cit> . accurate prediction, using computational methods, of sites in a protein sequence where ptm occurs would facilitate protein annotation and would contribute to efforts in functional genomics.

glycosylation  <cit> , a common ptm, plays a role in protein folding, transport and half-life, as well as being involved in cell-cell interactions and antigenicity. glycosylation is an enzymatic process, with the exception of glycation, and involves the addition of sugars to the protein to build up glycan chains. there are four types of glycosylation: n-linked, o-linked, c-mannosylation and gpi  anchor attachment. c-mannosylation involves the addition of α-mannopyranosyl to the indole of tryptophan. gpi anchors concern membrane anchoring of a protein by the addition of gpi near the c-terminus. n-linked and o-linked glycosylation are the most common and this study focuses on these modifications.

n-linked glycosylation consists of the addition of a pre-assembled glycan chain to asn. this occurs co-translationally and influences protein folding. after its addition, the glycan chain undergoes a maturation process, which can produce a glycan of the high mannose, hybrid or complex types. the sequence motif asn-xxx-ser/thr  <cit> , or in some rare cases asn-xxx-cys, where xxx is any amino acid except pro, is required for n-glycosylation, although not sufficient on its own. o-linked glycosylation consists of the stepwise build-up of various sugars on ser or thr residues. o-glycosylation has no known consensus sequence  <cit> . however, pro is often present around o-glycosylation sites  <cit>  and o-glycosylation occurs more often in the β-strands of proteins  <cit> .

several glycosylation predictors have been produced  <cit> . whilst these are not directly comparable, due to development on different datasets, the best predictors appear to be netoglyc  <dig>   <cit> , which is reported to predict correctly 76% of glycosylated residues and 93% of non-glycosylated residues, and oglyc  <cit>  with a reported accuracy of 85% correctly classified instances. netoglyc uses both sequence and predicted structural information  to train a back propagation neural network. oglyc uses support vector machines trained on a combination of physical properties of amino acids and a binary representation of the sequence. in this study we attempt to improve the prediction of glycosylation sites, using a new machine learning algorithm well suited to prediction from protein sequence data.

the random forest algorithm  <cit>  is based on decision trees. a decision tree consists of paths and nodes, with each node using a rule to decide between two or more paths. a rule is typically of the form 'if a then do b', where a is a condition relating to the descriptors of the input data and b is a step on the path through the trees. the last rule gives the classification of the input data example. several decision trees are developed using a random selection of inputs and random feature selection at each node to grow the trees. the trees then vote on the class for a given input. there is no previous research into predicting glycosylation using random forests, although the algorithm has been widely used, including for prediction of protein-protein interactions  <cit> , for analysis of microarray data  <cit>  and identification  <cit>  and prediction  <cit>  of the function of snps . the algorithm has been used for prediction of protein structure from nmr data  <cit>  and amino acid sequence  <cit> . the random forest algorithm has several features  <cit> , which make it suitable for applications such as the prediction of glycosylation sites. it can be used on a mixture of discrete and continuous descriptors, to classify binary or multi-class data sets and can cope with datasets where there are more variables than observations. the algorithm does not over-fit and continues to be successful, even when there is a large amount of noise in the data.

however, the models generated by random forest can be challenging to interpret. therefore, we have employed trepan  <cit> , an algorithm originally designed to allow the comprehension of neural networks. it has been adapted for use with other machine learning algorithms  <cit> . trepan uses the machine learning algorithm as an "oracle". by querying the oracle with the training data and its own generated examples, trepan induces a decision tree using m of n rules , thus giving a comprehensible picture of an otherwise opaque machine learning algorithm.

in this paper, using the database of glycosylation sites oglycbase version  <dig>   <cit> , we analyse the amino acid frequencies around glycosylation sites. using the o-unique dataset  we apply the random forest algorithm implemented in weka  <cit> , combined with information about pairwise patterns, to predict the location of glycosylation sites in a given protein. pairwise pattern information has previously been used for protein sequence analysis: for example, to predict whether a coiled coil region adopts a leucine zipper structure  <cit>  and to assist in the prediction of protein secondary structure from amino acid sequence  <cit> . we also experiment with the addition of predicted secondary structure, predicted surface accessibility, and hydrophobicity of the amino acids in an effort to increase the prediction accuracy. our prediction program is known as gpp  and is available on-line at: . we would like to interpret the models for the random forest algorithm, and thus gain some biological insight into glycosylation. whilst random forest produces individual rules that are human readable, in the case of gpp for each of the three types of glycosylation there are ten models of ten trees each. there are redundancies and potentially even conflicts between the different models. we aggregate these models into a single decision tree using the trepan algorithm  <cit> , providing clear rules for each glycosylation type.

RESULTS
frequency analysis
we conduct the frequency analysis using the oglycbase dataset. this was used, rather than o-unique, because it has a greater volume and range of sequences allowing statistically significant differences to the background to be more visible. there is also a wider range of sequences than o-unique and it is useful to observe whether there are trends across the whole spectrum of glycol-proteins i.e. is our method likely to be useful for predicting more than just the mammalian glycosylation sites found in o-unique. the consensus sequence for asn glycosylation is clearly exhibited in the frequency table . the only amino acids in evidence at the + <dig> position are ser, thr and cys, with low numbers of pro at the + <dig> position. at the - <dig> position there is an increase in asp and at the - <dig> position there is a significant increase in met. met is hydrophobic in nature, and is the only such amino acid to be increased around glycosylated asn residues. at the - <dig> position gln is significantly increased. cys is increased at the + <dig> position, indicating that cys assists glycosylation at this position. there is an increase in pro at the + <dig> position, which is perhaps surprising, as pro disfavours glycosylation when found at + <dig> in almost all cases  <cit> . it may be that pro helps create a structural conformation favourable for glycosylation when found at this position.

frequency is reported as the number of occurrences in the set of  <dig> instances of modified asn residues. statistically significant increases over the expected frequencies are represented in bold; significant decreases are represented by italics. the full table containing all amino acids is included in additional file  <dig> 

around modified ser residues there is known to be an abundance of pro, ser and thr and the frequency analysis  shows increases of ser and thr across the sequence window and increases in pro at positions - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of those positions where pro is increased, - <dig> and + <dig> present the greatest increases. there is an increase in ala around the glycosylation site at position - <dig> perhaps suggesting small amino acids are preferred here. there is also a decrease in phe at this position. leu is decreased at - <dig>  - <dig>  + <dig>  and + <dig>  and lys at + <dig> and + <dig>  this suggests that these amino acids may have an unfavourable effect on glycosylation.

frequency is reported as the number of occurrences in the set of  <dig> instances of modified ser residues. statistically significant increases over the expected frequencies are represented in bold; significant decreases are represented by italics. the full table containing all amino acids is included in additional file  <dig> 

modified thr residues  exhibit elevations in thr at all positions except + <dig> and pro at all odd numbered positions. there is an increase in ser at the - <dig> position. this suggests that where thr and ser glycosylation sites are clustered together, they are almost always consecutive in sequence. pro is particularly increased at the + <dig> position, suggesting this is important for glycosylation, as was shown by others  <cit> . there is a decrease in ile at position - <dig> and an increase at - <dig>  gly is increased downstream at positions - <dig> and - <dig>  and upstream at positions + <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig>  gly is also decreased at - <dig> and + <dig>  gln is decreased at the - <dig> position, as is lys, which is also decreased at - <dig>  and + <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  there is a general decrease in leu around the glycosylation site, particularly at the - <dig> and + <dig> positions. arg is decreased at - <dig>  - <dig> and +3

pairwise patterns
the pairwise patterns for each residue type were ranked by weight to identify those most likely to be found around modified residues. these patterns have significant frequencies around unmodified residues, as well as around modified residues. the weights of some patterns are very similar, especially those for ser, and statistical fluctuations due to the relatively small size of the dataset mean that the rank order of these patterns may not be exact.

around asn residues  the consensus sequence for asn glycosylation was visible, with the patterns .......n.t.....  and .......n.s.....  as the top two patterns identified. other patterns have substantially lower weights indicating the significance of the consensus sequence. further patterns in the list indicate that gln at - <dig> may be significant, as well as ser, ala and arg at various positions. gln at - <dig> is also increased in the frequency analysis above and so may be a significant factor. however, there is no significant increase of ser, ala and arg at corresponding positions in the frequency analysis, so it is possible this is only evident as part of a pairwise pattern.

the most significant pattern around ser is pro at the + <dig> position, which is in line with the frequency analysis. other patterns include pro ser, ile and thr at various positions indicating that these amino acids may play a prominent role when linked with either ser or thr. many of the patterns around ser residues have similar weights, although pro at + <dig> is markedly more significant.

whilst no consensus sequence has been shown for thr, around thr residues  there are correlations between the patterns, which suggest one or more sequence motifs may enhance the propensity for glycosylation. the majority of the patterns in the top  <dig> contain one of ile, thr, pro or ser, suggesting that these amino acids favour glycosylation. given the frequency, and the analysis above  it is likely that at least one or more of these amino acids is required for thr glycosylation. the most prominent pattern is of pro and thr at the + <dig> and + <dig> positions, respectively. this could indicate either a motif that encourages glycosylation or the importance of the clustering of ser and thr glycosylation sites together given the significance of pro in the neighbourhood of both. there are also several patterns with high significance involving glu always upstream of the glycosylation site, although no significant increase of this was found in the frequency analysis.

prediction accuracy
we measured the prediction accuracy of gpp trained using the pattern weight and sequence only, and using additional structural information. for o-linked glycosylation sites the change in accuracy with additional information was minimal. for n-linked glycosylation an increase in accuracy was observed with the addition of predicted surface accessibility information. there was also a much smaller increase with the addition of predicted secondary structure information . the prediction of thr sites was more accurate than that of ser sites. the matthews correlation coefficient, specificity and overall accuracy were higher. however, the sensitivity was higher for the ser site predictions. this was also the case in for predictions of ser and thr carried out with additional information. in comparison to naïve bayes, the prediction by random forest is superior. all predictions by naïve bayes have a substantial loss in sensitivity and a much lower matthews correlation coefficient.

we first compare the results to the netoglyc  <cit> , oglyc  <cit>  and netnglyc  prediction servers . the comparison with o-glycosylation predictors comes with the caveat that they may have been trained and tested with different data, which included differing ratios of positive and negative instances. we also had a slightly different focus than these predictors, in that we do not restrict ourselves to mucin glycosylation sites. for netoglyc, we use data published in julenius et al.  <cit> . the accuracy measures reported did not include correctly classified instances; so we calculated this from the information published. no published results are available for netnglyc; so we submitted the sequences in the o-unique dataset to the netnglyc web server and calculated the accuracy measures described above. we also compare predictions for the asn dataset to a basic pattern search for the consensus sequence carried out by scansite  <cit> . li et al.  <cit>  did not give the matthews correlation coefficient for the oglyc predictions. therefore, we calculated it from the reported data and also use the measures of correctly classified instances, sensitivity and specificity for this comparison. we converted the values provided by li et al. into percentages. oglyc only report the combined accuracy; separate accuracy information for ser and thr was not available. the comparison with oglyc was carried out against their dataset  <dig>  which produce the best results for their predictor. the gpp predictor has a higher correlation coefficient and sensitivity than netnglyc. scansite correctly predicts most positive instances of asn glycosylation and has a higher sensitivity and specificity than netnglyc. however, gpp is more accurate and has higher matthews correlation coefficient, sensitivity and specificity. our prediction of thr sites is better in all measures than that of netoglyc. for ser prediction our overall accuracy is comparable, although we have a higher matthews correlation coefficient. netoglyc has a higher specificity and a lower sensitivity than gpp. there is a higher ratio of negatives to positives in the ser data set compared to that for asn and thr. this affects the pattern weights, bringing them closer together and making it more difficult for the random forest to discriminate between modified and unmodified residues. there are also more types of sugar in more equal proportions in the ser dataset, creating a more difficult task for the random forest. the asn dataset does not experience similar effects: its consensus sequence motif is easily picked out  by the random forest algorithm. there are no data for separate ser and thr predictions available for oglyc  <cit> . their overall prediction accuracy of  <dig> %  is less than the overall accuracy of gpp, and we also score better in sensitivity and specificity.

two more recent predictions servers, ensemblegly by caragea et al.  <cit>  and cksaap by chen et al.  <cit> , were published during the completion of this work. caragea et al. use ensembles of support vector machines to predict o- and n-linked glycosylation sites. caragea et al. calculate sensitivity as sn = tp/. we convert this measure into a percentage. calculating this measure for gpp, for asn prediction, sn =  <dig> ; for ser, sn =  <dig> ; for thr, sn =  <dig> ; and for the combined o-linked predictions, sn =  <dig> . gpp has a greater matthews correlation coefficient for both n- and o-linked prediction . for n-linked sites they have a greater accuracy and sensitivity, but gpp has greater specificity and matthews correlation coefficient, indicating ensemblegly has a greater number of false negative predictions. for o-linked sites, gpp scores better for sensitivity, specificity and matthews correlation coefficient. chen et al. predict mucin glycosylation sites using k-spaced pairwise patterns and support vector machines. this method has some similarities with our own and the accuracy of the two methods is comparable. however, gpp is more accurate for both ser and thr predictions.

rule extraction
trepan identifies the consensus motif for asn glycosylation  as the most prominent rules in the decision tree. however, subsequent rules are somewhat misleading as they allow glycosylation without the consensus sequence being present. this is probably an artefact of the generation of additional data by trepan. this approach is reliant on the distribution of the training data and will highlight patterns additional to the consensus sequence. the tree corresponding to thr glycosylation  shows features in line with the statistical data. pro at residue + <dig> increases glycosylation when accompanied by a ser or thr. the end of the sequence seems to be given undue importance. however, other rules are in line with the frequency analysis. cys seems to strongly discourage glycosylation, whilst ser, thr and pro encourage it when accompanied by various other amino acids. some rules may be inexact, due to the limited data in o-unique that trepan can base its derived examples on. this is also true for the ser tree . the tree for ser is similar to the one for thr, although more complicated. once again the end of the sequence is implicated as is the presence of pro at various positions. cys again seems to block glycosylation, whilst ser, thr, glu, and pro all encourage it when present at various positions along the sequence, especially in conjunction.

CONCLUSIONS
the random forest algorithm was used to predict glycosylation sites, based on pairwise sequence patterns and the amino acid sequence. the program improved over the best prediction programs currently available, with significant increases in accuracy for the prediction of thr and asn glycosylation sites. neither the addition of structural data, hydrophobicity information nor surface accessibility data improved the prediction accuracy of o-linked glycosylation, although n-linked glycosylation prediction is improved by the addition of surface accessibility data. however, it may be possible to improve prediction accuracy further through the inclusion of information on protein disorder and information on the orientation of membrane proteins. it may also be possible to increase accuracy by extending the initial data set, or by considering separately proteins whose ptm is catalysed by the same enzyme. another option would be to produce prediction programs for each specific glycan type, or to classify each glycosylation site by type of glycan after prediction. our use of the trepan algorithm allows us to extract comprehensible rules describing features characteristic of a glycosylation site.
