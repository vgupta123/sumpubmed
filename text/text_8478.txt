BACKGROUND
uptake of long chain fatty acids  is important for many cellular functions and the understanding of the uptake mechanisms is an important target for treatment of lipid disorders  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane are still a matter of debate and the predominating mechanism likely differs from cell to cell . in general, two possible groups of mechanisms are discussed: simple diffusion and saturable transport processes. whereas the uptake based on the passive diffusion process depends on the activity of intracellular metabolism creating a transmembrane downhill concentration gradient; the saturable process is regulated by expression of certain proteins and lipids at the plasma membrane. much effort has been spent to identify candidate proteins that are directly involved in the facilitated fatty acid uptake mechanism. so far four candidates  have been discussed  <cit> . whereas fat/cd <dig> and fabppm are membrane associated fatty acid binding proteins that are thought to mediate their dissociation from albumin and accumulation at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane  <cit> , followed by flip-flop across the phospholipid bilayer to the cytosolic site; it has been suggested that fatps are real transporters directly involved in the uptake process of lcfas across the membrane bilayer  <cit> . however, recent data from our laboratory suggest that this group of proteins are rather enzymes that indirectly facilitate the translocation process by encompassing acyl-coa activity  <cit> .

the composition of membrane lipids also modulates fatty acid uptake. in particular, there is increasing evidence that cholesterol is of crucial importance. cholesterol depletion in 3t <dig> adipocytes, hmec, hek <dig> or hepg <dig> cells decreased lcfa uptake and this effect was reversible after re-addition of cholesterol  <cit> . caveolin- <dig> has been suggested to regulate the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane  <cit>  and lcfa uptake. caveolin- <dig> can bind lcfas  <cit> . caveolin- <dig> knock out mice showed a reduced mass of adipocytes and increased serum free fatty acids, indicating that lcfa uptake into adipocytes might be impaired  <cit> . lcfa uptake is increased by caveolin- <dig> overexpression and inhibited in caveolin- <dig> knockout mouse fibroblasts  <cit>  or by expression of the dominant negative caveolin- <dig> mutant cavdgv  <cit> . interestingly, the inhibitory effects of cavdgv can be reversed by replenishing the cell membranes with cholesterol and can be mimicked by methyl-β cyclodextrin treatment  <cit> .

all these studies point out that cholesterol is critically involved in lcfa uptake. however, little is known about the mechanisms by which cholesterol modulates this process. we have previously hypothesized that the association of fat/cd <dig> with lipid rafts might determine this process  <cit> . rafts are lateral assemblies of sphingolipids and cholesterol within cellular membranes involved in compartmentalization of membrane processes  <cit> . biochemically, lipid raft constituents are characterized by their insolubility in low concentration of detergents such as triton x- <dig>  <cit> . in this regard, it has been demonstrated that a fraction of fat/cd <dig> associates with detergent-resistant membranes  in a cholesterol-dependent manner  <cit> . the reduction of overall lcfas uptake by cholesterol depletion was as effective as the specific inhibition of the fat/cd <dig> function by sulfo-n-succinimidyl oleate . simultaneous treatments had no additional effect, suggesting that both procedures target the same cellular compartment  <cit> .

the most straightforward interpretation of these findings is that there are two pools of fat/cd <dig> at the plasma membrane, one associated with lipid rafts, in which lcfas are transported, and another outside of rafts, where no transport occurs. that means, fat/cd <dig> has to reside in lipid rafts to facilitate fa uptake. cholesterol depletion would shift fat/cd <dig> into the surrounding lipid bilayer and make this protein non-functional. if fat/cd <dig> facilitated uptake of fatty acids requires that the receptor is associated with lipid rafts, then regulation of this association may represent a mechanism by which cellular uptake of fatty acids can be regulated. in this paper we provide evidence demonstrating that association of fat/cd <dig> with lipid rafts is critical for the uptake process to occur.

RESULTS
cholesterol depletion inhibits long chain fatty acid uptake in cos cells
to study the role of lipid rafts in long chain fatty acid uptake we first analyzed again the effect of cholesterol depletion also in cos cells. cholesterol depletion was done by treatment with the complexing agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin  that extracts plasma membrane cholesterol. immediately prior to testing uptake of -oleic acid, cos cells were treated with  <dig> mm mβcd for  <dig> min. by this the cholesterol levels could be reduced to 50% of those of control cells. to easily monitor the role of fat/cd <dig> in fatty acid uptake cells were transiently tranfected with cdna of fat/cd <dig>  using lipofectamine as a mediator up to 50% of cells could be transfected. overexpression of fat/cd <dig> resulted in an increased overall uptake of -oleic acid by >20% within  <dig> min . depletion of cholesterol with mβcd decreased fatty acid uptake by >50% in both control cells and fat/cd <dig> transfected cells . these results show again that cholesterol is critically involved in -oleate uptake.

inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis decreases lcfa uptake
rafts are cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched microdomains. to find out whether sphingolipids are also important for lcfa uptake, we tested the effect of inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis.

cos cells were cultured in the presence of  <dig> μm myriocin, which inhibits the first step of de novo ceramide synthesis by interacting with the serine-palmitoyl transferase or treated with  <dig> u of sphingomyelinase that is supposed to deplete plasma membrane sphingolipids. cells were either treated for  <dig> d with myriocin before cotransfection of fat/cd <dig> and fatp <dig> or treated  <dig> d after cotransfection for  <dig> min with  <dig> u of sphingomyelinase. -oleate uptake within  <dig> min was measured. both treatments resulted in a reduction of -oleate uptake by  <dig> ± 3%  and  <dig> ± 2% , respectively . the ganglioside gm <dig> localizes to lipid rafts and its plasma membrane level is altered by inhibition of ceramide synthesis  <cit> . we monitored the effect of myriocin and sphingomyelinase by staining of the ganglioside gm <dig> with rhodamine-conjugated cholera toxin subunit b . myriocin treatment led to a decrease in staining, suggesting a decreased amount of total sphingolipids . sphingomyelinase resulted in similar results . thus, -oleate uptake can also be altered by depletion of sphingolipids.

fat/cd <dig> co-patches with placental alkaline phosphatase and segregates from non-raft marker gfp-tmd
lipid rafts are small and highly dispersed at the plasma membrane. in fibroblasts using photonic force microscopy it has been found that individual rafts have a size of about  <dig> nm and contain approximately  <dig> sphingolipid molecules and probably a subset of 10– <dig> protein molecules  <cit> . therefore they are too small to be resolved by light microscopy. however, raft and non-raft markers can be cross-linked with antibodies into visible patches  <cit> . raft proteins co-patch with each other and segregate away from non-raft markers. thus, cross-linking with antibodies can be used as a tool to analyse raft association. we therefore tested whether antibody cross-linking induces co-patching of fat/cd <dig> with a raft marker, the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol -anchored protein placental alkaline phosphatase . as a non-raft marker, we used gfp-tmd. cos cells were transfected and the respective plasma membrane antigens cross-linked with antibodies recognizing the extracellular part of the membrane proteins. fat/cd <dig> clearly co-localized together with plap at the plasma membrane in the majority of cells and segregated from gfp-tmd . as expected  <cit>  fatp <dig> showed an intracellular pattern completely different from fat/cd <dig>  as it could not be detected at the plasma membrane no co-patching with fat/cd <dig>  could be seen. this supports again our previous data  <cit>  that fatp <dig> is an enzyme at the er level, indirectly involved in fatty acid uptake due to enzyme activity.

antibody induced cross-linking increases the association of fat/cd <dig> to detergent resistant membranes
various proteins associate to lipid rafts with different kinetics and partition coefficients  <cit> . it has been shown that antibody-induced patching may stabilize association of raft proteins with detergent-resistant membranes   <cit> . we therefore analysed the association of fat/cd <dig> to drms under cross-linking with antibodies.

in initial experiments cos cells were transfected with fat/cd <dig> and then extracted with triton x- <dig> and subjected to optiprep™ step gradient centrifugation. under those conditions in three independent experiments no significant effect of antibody cross-linking could be detected. fat/cd <dig> was found in both triton x- <dig> resistant and soluble fractions showing that there are two pools of fat/cd <dig> in cellular membranes. however, when fatp <dig> was co-expressed with fat/cd <dig> raft association of the fat/cd <dig> was increased . co-expression of the cytosolic green fluorescent protein  or the er marker sec61-gfp  <cit>  did not change drm association of fat/cd <dig> . performing cross-linking under co-expressing conditions revealed a clearly increased fraction of fat/cd <dig> in the drm fraction . therefore, drm association of fat/cd <dig> can be increased by cross-linking with antibodies, which probably reflects increased raft affinity caused by oligomerization. similar results have been demonstrated for other proteins, which by forming oligomers increase their raft association  <cit> . the fact that increased association of fat/cd <dig> to drms occurs especially in fatp <dig> overexpressing cells indicates a promoting effect of fatp <dig> for fat/cd <dig> raft association.

cross-linking of fat/cd <dig> with antibodies increases oleate uptake
if long chain fatty acid uptake were to take place in lipid rafts, then antibody cross-linking should not only induce co-patching with raft markers at the surface of living cells and increase association between fat/cd <dig> and drms. it should also increase lcfa uptake, provided that the antibody does not neutralize lcfa binding or transport to find this out, we analyzed the effect of antibody cross-linking on overall -oleate uptake. cells were co-transfected with fatp <dig> and fat/cd <dig> and -oleate uptake analyzed within  <dig> min in the presence of anti-fat/cd <dig> from biosource . antibody enhanced cross-linking indeed increased -oleate uptake significantly. we next examined the effect of cholesterol depletion on antibody-induced -oleate uptake. immediately prior to the uptake assay transfected cells were treated for  <dig> min with  <dig> mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin and again uptake within  <dig> min was analyzed. after cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, -oleate uptake was no longer enhanced by antibody cross-linking . thus, under conditions in which rafts are supposed to be disrupted  increased uptake of -oleate due to cross-linking with antibodies is not detectable. thus, lipid raft integrity is important for fat/cd <dig> function in fatty acid uptake.

discussion
the data presented here strengthen the evidence that fat/cd <dig> partition into lipid rafts and that lcfa uptake mediated by fat/cd <dig> depends on this association.

first of all, we could show that lcfa uptake was critically dependent on the integrity of lipid rafts. lipid rafts are cholesterol and sphingolipid enriched microdomains. removal of raft lipids from cells leads to disruption of raft functions  <cit> . consistent with previous results on other cells  <cit>  we could demonstrate that by decreasing cellular levels of cholesterol, lcfa uptake in cos cells was also inhibited by > 50%. additionally, we could show that by decreasing ceramide synthesis with myriocin or depleting membrane sphingolipids using external sphingomyelinase we were able to lower lcfa uptake. sphingolipid depletion was less dramatic, probably because it is more difficult to lower cellular sphingolipid levels than cholesterol levels. the effects of sphingolipid synthesis inhibition may also be more pleiotropic because there are many different kinds of sphingolipids . nevertheless, we found that plasma membrane gm <dig> levels were reduced after myriocin treatment, demonstrating that not only cholesterol but also sphingolipids modulate lcfa uptake.

another important finding supporting raft association was that after cross-linking with antibodies fat/cd <dig> co-patched with placental alkaline phosphatase , a gpi-anchored raft protein, in living cells and segregated from patches formed by cross-linking of gfp-tmd that served as a non-raft marker. this assay has previously been used to monitor if proteins associate with lipid rafts at the cell  <cit> . antibody cross-linking of surface proteins leads to the formation of plasma membrane clusters that can be easily observed during light microscopy. it has been shown that co-patching is dependent on plasma membrane cholesterol, as patching is inhibited by cholesterol removal  <cit> .

antibody cross-linking increased drm association of fat/cd <dig> as was previously demonstrated for other raft proteins  <cit> . because a considerable amount of fat/cd <dig> was also found in the soluble fraction after detergent treatment, fat/cd <dig> is probably found  in two membrane pools, one raft associated and another localized in the surrounding bilayer. how partitioning between these two pools is regulated is an open question, but interestingly it has been shown that fat/cd <dig> can dimerize  <cit> . oligomerization of raft components is known to lead to increased raft affinity  <cit> . therefore this mechanism might be important to regulate raft association of fat/cd <dig> 

it has been previously hypothesized that the detergent soluble fraction might represent intracellular fat/cd <dig> and that upon cholesterol depletion fat/cd <dig> might be stuck in the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane  <cit> . it has been described, that fat/cd <dig> can indeed translocate between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments  <cit> . however, recent data from covey et al  <cit>  using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry convincingly show that in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes cholesterol depletion inhibits uptake of lcfas without affecting fat/cd <dig> or caveolin- <dig> distribution within the cells, indicating that cholesterol levels regulate lfca uptake via a pathway that does not involve altered surface localization of fat/cd <dig>  our cross-linking data, which were obtained on living cells at 10°c, can explain these findings because under these conditions intracellular antigens are not accessible to antibodies. therefore increased drm association of fat/cd <dig>  after cross-linking with antibodies likely represent a horizontal recruitment of plasma membrane non-raft associated fat/cd <dig> into raft domains. the enrichment of drm associated fat/cd <dig> could only be detected in presence of co-expressed fatp <dig>  whether the fatp <dig> acitivity as acyl-coa synthetase drives cellular fatty acid influx and, thus, the requirement for raft associated fat/cd <dig> or whether fatp <dig> is actively involved in the raft constitution process remains to be elucidated. fatp <dig> has been originally described to by a major fatty acid transporter at the apical membrane of enterocytes  <cit>  and it has been speculated that both proteins might cooperate at the plasma membrane in fatty acid uptake  <cit> . however recent data could not support this view  <cit> . fatp <dig> seems rather to be an enzyme for acyl-coa activity at the er level and therefore indirectly increases fatty acid uptake. deletion of fatp <dig> resulted in a perinatal lethality with a phenotype reminiscent of lethal restrictive dermopathy  <cit> . by histology the skin was characterized by a hyperproliferative hyperkeratosis with a disturbed epidermal barrier. lipid analysis of the skin revealed an increased proportion of ceramides and cholesterol. within the ceramide fraction very long chain fatty acid substitutes were significantly reduced  <cit> . these finding suggests that fatp <dig> is involved in ceramide biosynthesis, possibly by providing coa activity for very long chain fatty acids. it is intriguing to speculate that this protein might therefore have also impact on lipid raft integrity. rafts are enriched in sphingolipids  and their long chain fatty acid substitutes have been implicated to be important to connect the outer and the inner layer of the microdomain. fatp <dig> would therefore be indirectly involved in the fatty acid uptake process by providing the molecules for a functional lipid raft assembly. this could explain our results of an enhanced raft association of fat/cd <dig> after overexpression of fatp <dig> 

in general clustering of lipid rafts can be achieved by different mechanisms  <cit> . besides antibodies also other ligands , lectins or linker proteins have been discussed. which would be a reasonable mechanism for fat/cd <dig> clustering? it is conceivable that under physiological conditions the clustering of fat/cd <dig> is mediated by binding of long chain fatty acids. it was indeed shown that the artificial, long chain fatty acid -sulfo-n-succinimidyl oleate  – when incubated with adipocytes – binds to fat/cd <dig> with high affinity and is almost exclusively found in drms  <cit> . thus the concentration of fatty acids presented to the plasma membrane may regulate the rate of fatty acid uptake by providing a sufficient functional platform in the form of fat/cd36-raft complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
our data support a crucial role for lipid rafts in lcfa uptake. compartmentalization of fat/cd <dig> at the cell surface by lipid rafts seems to be important in regulating its involvement in lcfa uptake. taken all data together it seems possible that fatty acid binding increases raft affinity of fat/cd <dig>  the protein is shifted from the surrounding bilayer to these microdomains were lcfa uptake is likely to occur.
