BACKGROUND
the cichlid species flock in lake tanganyika is a model system of adaptive radiation, defined as the rapid evolution of a multitude of species from a common ancestor as a consequence of their adaptation to various ecological niches. after the formation of the lake,  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago, several ancestral strains diversified into more than  <dig> species in  <dig> tribes  <cit> . tanganyikan cichlids are unique because of the species richness of each of the ecomorphs  <cit>  that have evolved convergently and coexist in similar habitats, not only among different lakes but also within lake tanganyika  <cit> . additionally, only six of the fourteen tribes present in lake tanganyika show sexual dichromatism; the others are monochromatic lineages  <cit> , in contrast to other african lakes in which the degree of cichlids’ adaptive radiation correlates highly with the presence of sexual dichromatism  <cit> .

in lake tanganyika, five tribes of the family cichlidae  have acquired several ecomorphs that are closely related to feeding habits in herbivory such as grazing, browsing, scraping, biting, and scooping  <cit> . these tribes have no sexual dichromatism, and therefore, we can focus on the effect of ecological opportunity in the adaptive radiation of these herbivorous cichlids  <cit> . grazers, browsers, and scrapers are highly specialised and diversified, especially in these herbivorous habits  <cit> . grazers comb unicellular algae from epilithic assemblages using multiple rows of similar-sized slender teeth with fork-like tricuspid tips  <cit> . browsers nip and nibble filamentous algae using their bicuspid teeth, which line the outermost of both jaws  <cit> . scrapers rub epiphyton from rock surfaces using several rows of chisel-like teeth  <cit> . the fishes of each ecomorph have distinct specialised trophic morphologies in their jaw structures and intestine lengths  <cit> , physiological abilities, such as secretion of digestive enzymes  <cit>  and behaviours, such as cropping frequency  <cit> .

in one rocky littoral area of the lake,  <dig> species of herbivorous cichlids coexist  <cit> . seven of them individually defend their feeding territories against intruding herbivores to establish algal farms on which the territory-holder feeds  <cit> . grazers and browsers utilise species-specific depth ranges, and species in the same depth range choose the substratum types on which they feed  <cit> . in particular, territorial cichlids of the same ecomorph exhibit separate habitat depths  <cit> , and ecological character displacement in habitat depth and associated body shape were reported in sympatric populations of tropheus moorii and tropheus polli, compared to isolated populations of the two species  <cit> .

niche segregation leading to multi-species coexistence has at least three axes: space, food and time  <cit> . these herbivorous cichlids are diurnally active and do not have separate active times during the day  <cit> . in this study, we focused on food and habitat depth. how do feeding specialisation and habitat-depth selection cause food-source segregation, thereby enabling the coexistence of multiple species in the same ecomorph in this adaptive radiation system? to answer this question, the degree of diet disparity in algae and cyanobacteria between herbivorous cichlid species was analysed at the species-level using a metagenomic amplicon sequencing approach. based on 454-pyrosequencing of ssu rrna gene sequences, we described algal and cyanobacterial compositions in algal farms and the stomach contents of herbivorous cichlid species on a rocky slope of lake tanganyika. the composition of algal farms was compared among ecomorphs and among species within each ecomorph, and the effect of habitat depth on the composition was analysed. the stomach contents were compared among ecomorphs and among species within each ecomorph, and were compared with algal farm composition. finally, the relationships between the phylogenetic distances between fish species and the similarity of algal farms and stomach contents were analysed.

RESULTS
we sampled  <dig> species of herbivorous cichlids  from kasenga point  near mpulungu, zambia, on the southern tip of lake tanganyika in november  <dig> . periphyton samples were simultaneously collected from five territories each of t. temporalis, v. moorii, p. macrognathus, p. polyodon, p. horii, p. trewavasae, t. moorii, dominant males of i. loocki and p. curvifrons , and breeding pairs of e. cyanostictus and x. papilio. another  <dig> periphyton samples were collected from outside the cichlid territories. total dna was extracted from each of the stomach content samples of the cichlids and periphyton samples, and pyrosequencing of ssu rrna gene was conducted. the resulting  <dig>  consensus sequences represented operational taxonomic units . of the  <dig>  consensus reads,  <dig>  reads were excluded as singletons because such sequences are putatively erroneous. taxonomic assignment of the otus was performed by the query-centric auto-k-nearest-neighbour  method, using the software claident v.  <dig> . <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig>

in total, we identified  <dig> phototrophic otus . the algal farms of cichlids, periphytons outside the territories and stomach contents comprised  <dig>  ±  <dig>  phototrophic otus ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  otus and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  otus, respectively. of the  <dig> phototrophic otus observed,  <dig> were cyanobacteria,  <dig> were bacillariophytes,  <dig> were chlorophytes and the other  <dig> comprised euglenides, eustigmatophyceae, streptophytes, dinoflagellates, a rhodophyta and unknown viridiplantae . of the eukaryotic sequences,  <dig> were eukaryotic 18s sequences,  <dig> were chloroplast 16s sequences,  <dig> were mitochondrial 12s and 16s sequences, and  <dig> remained uncertain . to reduce variance in alpha-diversity among samples that resulted from differences in sequencing effort , each sample was rarefied to  <dig> reads using the rrarefy function in vegan v. <dig>  . we determined that the taxonomic composition within the sub-sampled  <dig> reads would provide a semi-quantitative measure of relative biomass within each sample.

phototroph composition in algal farms varied significantly among cichlid species . phototroph composition in stomach contents also varied significantly among cichlid species . these results indicate that variations within species are significantly smaller than variations among species. among species of the same feeding ecomorph, the phototroph compositions in both their defended farms and stomach contents were widely scattered.figure  <dig>

phototroph composition in algal farms and stomach contents mostly consisted of three phyla: chlorophyta, bacillariophyta and cyanobacteria . bacillariophytes were relatively more abundant in the stomachs of grazers compared to both the stomachs of browsers and the algal farms of grazers, indicating that grazers selectively ingested bacillariophytes. the stomach contents of browsers contained more cyanobacteria and chlorophytes than those of grazers. cladophora sp.  dominated the algal farms of all herbivorous cichlids, but most grazing herbivores seldom ingested this algal species. only a territorial browser  and non-territorial browser  and a scraper  ingested this alga. no cyanobacteria or algae other than the cladophora sp. were dominant throughout the algal farms of herbivorous cichlids. as shown by principal coordinate analysis  ordination, the phototroph compositions of algal farms and stomach contents differed considerably among species within the same feeding ecomorph.figure  <dig>

the habitat depths of cichlids differed significantly among species , and the depth significantly affected the phototrophic composition . two grazers , two browsers  and a scraper  inhabited the shallowest zone, two grazers , and two browsers  and a scooper  inhabited the intermediate depth, and a grazer  occupied the deepest zone . in addition to the depth segregation between cichlid species, phototrophic otus also showed significant variation in habitat depth . the shallower inhabitants of the orders nostocales  and oscillatoriales , the subclass oscillatoriophycideae , and two cyanobacteria  occurred frequently in algal farms of the cichlids in the sallowest zone. the relatively deep inhabitants, cladophora sp. , a stigonematales , and a diatom  occurred in the territories of cichlids living in the intermediate depths. a cladophorales  and a cyanobacteria  occurred frequently in the farms of the deepest inhabitant, p. horii. consequently, the standardised specialisation index  was significantly higher in the algal farms of cichlid species, with the exceptions of i. loocki and t. temporalis, than in a random network provided by a null model.figure  <dig>

the lower bipartite graphs in figure 4a,b show that different phototrophic species or different combinations of phototrophic species contributed to the stomach contents of different cichlid species even within the same depth range. all the cichlid species both living in shallow and deep zones had significant specific links with various phototrophic otus. neither dissimilarity in the algal farm composition or stomach contents in species-pairs was related to the phylogenetic distance of the pairs , even between species in the tropheini tribe, which comprises a single lineage of grazers and a few lineages of browsers . dissimilarity in algal farms and stomach contents did not differ between same-tribe pairs and different-tribe pairs, or between same feeding-ecomorph pairs and different ecomorph pairs , p > <dig>  for both factors, additional file 8: table s5). on the other hand, dissimilarity in algal farm composition was positively correlated with differences in habitat depth . dissimilarity in stomach contents of all the cichlids was not related to the difference in their habitat depths.figure  <dig>

discussion
phototroph composition in algal farms defended by herbivorous cichlids significantly varied among cichlid species, even among species in the same ecomorphs. this was due in part to habitat depth segregation of cichlids, as the dissimilarity of algal farms increased significantly when the difference in habitat depth increased. segregation of habitat range by depth among cichlid species has been described in several species pairs of the same ecomorphs  <cit> . additionally, the stomach contents of these cichlids were segregated by at least  <dig>  in the canberra dissimilarity index, even between species in the same feeding ecomorph inhabiting the same depth range. the stomach content compositions were quite different from those of the algal farms of the same species. these results indicate that these cichlid species are highly selective when ingesting phototrophs from their specific algal farms, resulting in specific utilisation of phototrophs by each cichlid species. consequently, similarity in algal farms was relatively high in the same depth range, but the stomach contents differed among species living in the same depth range. stomach contents of cichlids were so diverse that no significant effect of ecomorph, tribe, habitat depth, and their interactions on the similarities of the stomach contents was detected. these territorial cichlids ingest algae from specific points inside their territories  <cit> , and, therefore, further study on phototrophic distribution within territories and detailed feeding sites will reveal the mechanism that enables diet segregation among cichlid species of each ecomorph living in the same depth range.

stomachs of grazers had higher compositions of bacillariophytes, such as gomphonema sp., encyonema sp., and bacillariophyceae otu # <dig>  suggesting that grazers ingest these diatoms selectively. this result is in agreement with previous reports of high proportions of epiphytic unicellular algae in the stomachs of the grazers  <cit> , and with a study that found high activity of a digestive enzyme, laminarinase, which hydrolyses laminarine, the main polysaccharide of diatoms, in the grazer p. orthognathus  <cit> . on the other hand, browsers ingested more cyanobacteria, such as chroococcales, oscillatoriales and chlorophytes, such as scenedesmaceae. this result is in agreement with previous reports of high proportions of filamentous algae and cyanobacteria in the stomachs of browsers based on visual observations of stomach contents  <cit> .

a filamentous green alga, cladophora sp., dominated the farms of most cichlid species, but was not ingested often. cladophora are known to be unpalatable due to their chemical defences and poor amino acid contents  <cit> . therefore, this alga seems to be utilised as a substratum harbouring epiphytic diatoms for grazers and is a less preferred food item for other herbivorous cichlids.

in lake tanganyika, multiple species of herbivorous cichlids coexist sympatrically, but the number of ecomorphs is limited; therefore, the lake has been thought to be a ‘species-saturated’ community where the number of species exceeds the number of available niches  <cit> . this study, however, shows that these cichlids segregate their habitats on a finer scale, just as multiple anolis lizard species of the same ecomorph specialise in specific thermal microhabitats or specific prey sizes and coexist in the caribbean islands  <cit> .

our results demonstrate that phylogenetically close cichlid species neither always defend similar or opposite-structured algal farms nor ingest similar or opposite-structured phototrophic compositions. this confirms the hypothesis that niche lability exceeds niche conservatism in a community in which species have a long evolutionary history of ecological interaction, as seen in the adaptive radiation of caribbean anolis lizards  <cit> . this also suggests that the flexibility to specialise in microhabitats may drive their divergence and coexistence.

CONCLUSIONS
to date, it has been difficult to classify unicellular and filamentous algae, especially diatoms and cyanobacteria, to the species level, especially in stomach contents, and evidence of dietary segregation in herbivorous cichlids in the same feeding ecomorph is scarce  <cit> . this study revealed that the phototrophic composition of algal farms was quite different among species, even those in the same feeding ecomorph, because of habitat depth segregation among species. in addition, cichlid species selectively fed on phototrophs from their algal farms. as a result, the algal compositions of stomachs differed among species, even those in the same ecomorph inhabiting the same depth range. therefore, a metagenomic approach revealed food niche separation based on habitat-depth segregation and food preference among coexisting herbivorous cichlids in the same ecomorphs on a rocky shore of lake tanganyika.
