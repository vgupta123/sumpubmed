BACKGROUND
ticks, segregated into two families; ixodidae  and argasidae  are important vectors of several pathogens with a global veterinary and public health impact  <cit> . although research on ticks has for the most part been directed towards agricultural interests, ticks have been recognized as the second most important vectors of human disease agents after mosquitoes  <cit> . globally, the impact of tick borne disease agents on public health has been on a dramatic rise  <cit>  since the discovery of borelia burdgoferi as the causative agent for lyme disease in  <dig>  <cit> . literature reviews by parola and roult  <cit>  listed  <dig> new tick borne bacterial agents being discovered or recognized as human pathogens between  <dig> and  <dig>  in the united states ticks transmit more causative agents of vector borne diseases than any other vector arthropod  <cit> . tick borne human diseases reported in the usa include babesiosis, ehrlichisosis, southern tick-associated rash illness , lyme disease, tick-borne relapsing fever, anaplasmosis and rocky mountain spotted fever,  <cit> . from a human health perspective, ixodes scapularis and its close relatives, i. pacificus, i. ricinus and i. persulcatus and i. holocyclus are the most important ticks as they transmit the majority of emerging human disease pathogens. the importance of these ticks to human health was the key justification for funding of the i. scapularis genome, sequencing project  <cit> . key anticipated outcomes of the tick genome sequencing project will be provision of opportunities to identify unique tick genes that could be exploited for tick control and, thus the control of tick borne diseases  <cit> . we are interested in understanding the role of the serine proteinase inhibitors  in tick physiology and feeding.

serpins represent the largest family of proteinase inhibitors that is widely conserved across taxa, from animals to plants, viruses and bacteria  <cit> . of the  <dig> families of proteinase inhibitors listed on the merops database , the serpin family  has the largest number of entries. in humans, serpins make up 2% of total blood plasma proteins  <cit>  and are involved in the regulation of important pathways such as blood coagulation, complement activation, inflammation, fertilization and food digestion  <cit> . the importance of serpins in humans can be attested to by more than  <dig> human diseases such as cirrhosis, emphysema, blood coagulation disorders and dementia that arises from serpin malfunctions due to mutation  <cit> . in arthropods, serpins were linked to immunity in mosquitoes  <cit> , the fruit fly  <cit>  and the tobacco hornworm  <cit> , development in the fruit fly  <cit> , control of the hemolymph coagulation cascade in the horseshoe crab  <cit> . given the importance of serpins in the biology of multicellular organisms, it has been hypothesized that, ticks might utilize serpins to evade host defenses and immunizing against or disrupting functions of these proteins is an appealing option for designing new tick control strategies  <cit> .

more than  <dig> serpin encoding cdnas have now been cloned in several economically and medically important ticks including amblyomma americanum  <cit> , r. appendiculatus  <cit>  and i. ricinus  <cit>  and i. scapularis  <cit> . serpin encoding ests and cdna sequences of i. scapularis and r. microplus cited in  <cit>  are also available in genebank. studies by sugino et al.,  <cit> , imamura et al.,  <cit>  and prevot et al.,  <cit>  have provided encouraging evidence suggesting the potential of serpins as targets for tick control. these authors  <cit>  showed that feeding of ticks on animals immunized with recombinant tick serpins caused ticks to obtain smaller blood meals and as consequence reduced tick fecundity and mortality. these findings clearly suggest that serpins play important roles in tick physiology.

given the availability of i. scapularis genome sequence information in genebank and at vectorbase  <cit>  we thought to get some insight on the size of the serpin protein family in ticks. we report here on the identification and characterization at least  <dig> i. scapularis serpin genes. a sequence based analyses show that ~93% of these serpins are putatively inhibitory with 88%  of full-length serpins being putatively extracellular. our rt-pcr expression analyses data demonstrated that 84%  are differentially expressed in midguts and salivary glands of unfed and partially fed ticks. we have discussed our findings towards advances in i. scapularis tick molecular biology.

methods
discovery of ixodes scapularis serpin genes
the strategy to annotate serpin genes in the i. scapularis genome is summarized in figure  <dig>  in the first step, we downloaded supercontig dna sequences from vectorbase  <cit>  and created a local database. in the second step, the supercontig database was subjected to blastx homology search using the fasta <dig> software version  <dig>   <cit>  to identify serpin-encoding supercontigs. queries for this search, included α1-antitrypsin and  <dig> tick serpin sequences;  <dig> a. americanum  <cit> , one h. longicornis  <cit> , four r. appendiculatus  <cit> , six i. ricinus , and two in i. scapularis . in the third step, coding genomic dna sequences were assembled using genomescan analysis  <cit>  and the vectornti dna analysis software . genomescan analysis  <cit>  was used to align supercontig sequences with tick serpin protein sequences that were used as queries. this alignment identified exons, which were manually assembled into genomic coding sequences using the vectornti dna analysis software . in step four cdna sequences were assembled. this was done by scanning genomic dna coding sequences from step three against the i. scapularis trace archive est database. trace archive ests showing e-values of zero  and their mates were retrieved and assembled using contigexpress . prior to assembly any vector sequence contamination was removed using vector screen at ncbi. in step five, exon and intron boundaries were delineated based on donor-acceptor splice sites . this was accomplished by mapping cdna sequences onto appropriate supercontig sequences using the spidey software  <cit>  at ncbi with parameters set to drossophila melanogaster. in step six, coding domains were scanned against the whole shotgun genome database to retrieve accession numbers for primary sequences that were used to assemble the supercontigs used in this study.

bioinformatics analyses
for comparisons to known serpins, assembled coding sequences were scanned against known protein entries in genbank using the blastx or blastp homology search program. to validate their accuracy, inferred amino acid sequences were inspected for two amino acid motifs, "navykfg" and "dvneeg," that are conserved in most known serpins  <cit> . full-length and partial sequences were determined on the basis that, a typical serpin molecule ranges between 350– <dig> amino acid residues long  <cit> . to gain insight on probable functionality, inferred amino acid sequences were scanned against amino acid motif entries in scanprosite and signal peptides in the signalp servers . the reactive center loop  which determines the functionality  of a serpin molecule was determined based on consensus 20/ <dig> residue peptide "p <dig> -p <dig> -p <dig> -p <dig> -p <dig> -p12- <dig> -p8- <dig> -p1' -4' " in carboxy-terminus region  <cit> . the numbering here is based on the convention in which residues on the amino terminal side of scissile bond  are labeled as p <dig> to p <dig> and those on the carboxy terminal side are labeled as p1' -p4'  <cit> . the putative scissile bond  and the p <dig> residue were predicted based on the conserved features that there are generally  <dig> amino residues  between the start of the hinge region of the rcl, and scissile bond  <cit> .

guide phylogeny tree
in order to determine relationships among tick serpins, a guide tree of  <dig> tick serpins sequences,  <dig> full-length serpins from this study, and  <dig> other tick serpins that were downloaded from genebank, and human α1-antitrypsin  as an outlier were used to construct the guide tree using the neighbor joining method. specifications were set for bootstrap values at  <dig> replications, gaps proportionately distributed and correction for distance set to a poisson distribution. to determine the homologous features that influenced the clustering patterns, sequences of each clade were subjected to multiple sequence alignment analyses.

structural based sequence alignment and comparative modeling
to determine secondary structures, randomly selected representative sequences of each cluster in the guide phylogeny tree, serpins s <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were subjected structural based sequence alignment using the web based strap  . subsequently, secondary structures were superimposed on the structurally aligned sequences using the human α1-antitrypsin tertiary structure  as template. the aligned sequences were subsequently viewed using the genedoc sequence analysis software for windows .

expression analyses by rt-pcr
oligodt primed salivary gland  and midgut  cdna templates of unfed ticks and ticks that were fed for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs used in this study were a gift from dr. shahid karim, formerly at the university of rhode island, now at university of mississippi. the harvest of tick tissues and synthesis of cdna were done as previously described by kotsyfakis et al.,  <cit> . one μl aliquots of these templates were used in a pcr reaction with specific pcr primers . pcr products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing  <dig> μg/ml ethidium bromide. the tick actin gene  was used for pcr template load control. to determine mrna abundance, densitograms of amplified pcr bands were determined using the web based imagej software . to correct for variations in pcr template concentrations, pcr band densities were normalized using the following formula; y = v + v /x where y = normalized mrna density, v = observed ispin pcr band density in individual tissues , h = highest tick actin pcr band density among tested tissues , x = tick actin density in mg or sg  <cit> .

RESULTS
discovery of i. scapularis serpin genes
we successfully used homology search engines, fasta <dig> version  <dig>   <cit> , blastx and blastn to scan supercontigs of the i. scapularis genome and annotated  <dig> serpin genes in the i. scapularis genome . of the  <dig> genes, serpins   <dig> to  <dig> occur in a cluster spanning  <dig> kb of dna sequence  and the rest occur singly or in pairs. when scanned against the i. scapularis trace archive cdna database, 72%  of the serpin coding regions showed matches in the est database with e-values of zero  . the delineation of introns and exons boundaries based on spidey  <cit>  and genome scan  <cit>  programs revealed that, the  <dig> serpin genes are structurally segregated into  <dig> intronless and  <dig> intron-containing genes. the intron-containing genes, have four exons with the first and second exon coding for the 5' untranslated region  and the third and fourth exons coding for the open reading frame and the 3' utr . of the  <dig> intron-containing genes, nine belong to the cluster of  <dig> genes shown in figure  <dig>

as summarized in table three, all i. scapularis serpin sequences showed best matches exclusively to other tick serpin sequences. except for s <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that respectively showed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 95% amino acid identity to i. ricinus serpin   <dig> , irs <dig> , irs <dig> , the i. ricinus immunosuppressant serpin  and irs <dig> , the identity levels between serpins in this study and other tick serpins ranged between  <dig> to 57% . two of the serpins genes in this study, s <dig> and  <dig> are  <dig> and 98% identical to previously annotated i. scapularis serpins, aam <dig> and aav <dig> respectively  <cit>  . at the time of preparing this manuscript, a preliminary annotation of the i. scapularis genome  was released . when scanned against this database, 88%  of the serpin sequences produced matches with e-values of zero. the reader is notified here that because neither supercontig accession numbers nor the preliminary gene annotations are referenced in genebank, whole genome shotgun sequence and/or trace archive accession numbers are given in table three to provide the source for primary sequence data that was used in this study.

inferred amino acid sequence analyses
a typical full-length serpin molecule may range between 350-to- <dig> amino acid residues long  <cit> . on this basis and in addition to possessing in frame start and stop codons,  <dig> of the  <dig> inferred serpin sequences were determined to be full-length . as indicated in table three, eight of the ten partial sequences are truncated at their amino terminus, while the remaining two sequences are truncated at their c-terminal. at their c-terminus, serpins are characterized by a flexible reactive center loop , the primary determinant of functionality  that acts as a pseudo-substrate for the target proteinase  <cit> . based on consensus amino acid residues  <cit> , rcls have been detected in all sequences , except for serpin  <dig> and  <dig> that are truncated at their c-terminus . on the basis that inhibitory serpins have more than 50% of "a" between p12- <dig> and that charged amino acid residues at p <dig> or "p" residues at p <dig> or p <dig> in the rcl, causes loss of inhibitory function  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> serpins that have a rcl are predicted to have inhibitor functions . in the rcl the p <dig> residue determines substrate specificity  <cit> . by consensus there are generally  <dig> amino acid residues  between the start of the hinge region of the rcl, and scissile bond   <cit> . on this basis, visual inspection of putative rcl amino acid sequences revealed a diversity of  <dig> different residues k, r, l, g, a, s, e, c, y, i and m at the p <dig> sites . as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> serpin, sequences that have rcls are predicted to possess basic charged amino acid residues, "r" or "k" at their p <dig> site . of the  <dig> serpin sequences, seven belong to the cluster of  <dig> serpin genes that are shown in figure  <dig>  it is also interesting to note that eight other serpin genes possess basic residues at their p <dig> site.

amino acid motifs scan analyses
motif scan analyses on the scanprosite server  <cit>  revealed that the serpin signature motif pattern ps <dig> . on the signalp <dig>  server , 89%  of the  <dig> full-length serpin sequences were predicted to have leader sequences . other important motifs include the putative n-glycosylation  sites in  <dig> of the  <dig> serpin sequences. except for s <dig>  which was predicted to have eight putative n-glycosylation sites, the rest have between one to three sites. we also found the cell attachment motif "rgd" in four sequences, s <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

guide phylogeny analysis
in order to determine the relationship among tick serpins, we used the neighbor joining method to generate a phylogeny guide tree of  <dig> tick serpin sequences. from the α1-antitrypsin outlier,  <dig> tick serpin sequences segregated into five main clusters, a-e supported by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 93% bootstrap values . except for bmserp <dig>  all other sequences in main branch "a" have no signal peptides. the remaining sequences, all of which have signal peptides are segregated into branches "b-e".

i. scapularis serpins posses key residues that characterize the secondary structure the serpin superfamily
irving et al.,  <cit>  performed a sequence alignment of  <dig> serpin sequences and identified  <dig> core amino acid residues that underlie the functionality of inhibitory serpins. here we adopted this analysis by aligning the  <dig> full serpin sequence with the human α1-antitrypsin  and found that the  <dig> core residues that underpin the efficient functioning of an inhibitory serpin  <cit>  are 67–96%  conserved in i. scapularis serpins . the inhibitory mechanism of the serpins relies on their structural flexibility, which is controlled by the shutter region  <cit> . two amino acid motifs s53-p54-x55-s <dig> and i157-n158-x159-x160-v <dig>  that underpin the functioning of the shutter region  <cit>  are 100% conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> i. scapularis serpin sequences .

given the high conservation of core residues that underpin the functionality of serpins, we thought to determine whether or not the serpin common fold of 7– <dig> α-helices and three β-sheets  and the rcl  <cit>  were also conserved in the deduced serpin sequences. as shown in figure  <dig>  structural based sequence alignment of representative sequences  from each of the five main branches shown in figure  <dig>  revealed that the serpin secondary structure is conserved in i. scapularis serpins .

transcriptional analyses
to begin determining the role of serpins in this study in tick feeding and physiology, semi-quantitative rt-pcr was used to establish temporal and spatial expression patterns in salivary glands  and midguts  of unfed and ticks that were partially fed for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs . of the  <dig> serpin sequences,  <dig> are expressed in sg and mg;  <dig> being strongly expressed  and five weakly expressed . for clarity and limitations on space, we have presented our rt-pcr data in two panels. panel one  show expression patterns of serpin sequences that possesses basic residues  at their p <dig> sites, while expression patterns of the rest of the genes are displayed in panel two . on the basis of visual intensity of pcr bands  and analysis of normalized pcr band densities , expression patterns of the  <dig> genes can be segregated into four profiles. in the first pattern, six genes  whose transcript increased with tick feeding were expressed from six or  <dig> hrs of tick feeding. the next set of genes, are constitutively expressed in both mg and sg with their transcript abundance either increasing  or decreasing  as ticks continued to feed. the third group of genes s <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in panel one and s <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in panel two displayed a dichotomous expression pattern. in the case of s <dig>  it is expressed from  <dig> hrs in sg but constitutively expressed in mg with its transcript abundance increasing in both organs as ticks continue to feed. in the case of serpin s <dig> and  <dig>  which are induced from  <dig> hrs in sg and their transcript abundance increasing thereafter, are constitutively expressed in mg with transcript abundance decreasing as ticks continue to feed. for s <dig> and  <dig> in panel one, s <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in panel two, they are constitutively expressed in both organs, but their transcript abundance increases in sg and decreases in mg as ticks continue to feed. the fourth profile consist of genes that are predominantly or specifically expressed in sg  and mg  with transcript abundance decreasing for the former and increasing for the later as ticks continued to feed.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
analysis of genome sequence data has led to the discovery of large families of serpins in multicellular organisms, including  <dig> in humans, nine in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> ,  <dig> in drosophila  <cit>  and plants  <cit> . on the merops database,  <dig> and  <dig> serpin sequences are listed for aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae. in ticks, documentation of multiple serpin encoding cdnas has provided indirect evidence suggesting that ticks do encode large serpin families. for instance, we recently described  <dig> serpin cdnas that are expressed by a. americanum during feeding  <cit> . here we describe the annotation and characterization of  <dig> serpin genes in the i. scapularis genome. the observed high amino acid sequence identity between i. scapularis and i. ricinus serpins was not surprising as these two ticks belong to the same genus. it is important to point out that eight of the  <dig> annotated were not represented in the preliminary peptide build at vectorbase. this finding may raise the prospect of error in annotations reported here. interestingly, this possibility is ruled out, as ests of six of the eight serpins in this study  were present in the trace archive database, while coding regions of serpins s <dig> and  <dig> were amplified from unfed and partially fed ticks .

the adoption of the consensus serpin secondary structures  <cit>  and the high conservation of the core amino acid residues  <cit>  that underpin the structure and functionality of serpins strongly suggested that, i. scapularis serpins are functional. the majority of known serpins function as inhibitors of serine proteinases and hence the name  <cit> . however others with activity against cysteine proteinases and those with no inhibitor functions have also been described  <cit> . although on the basis of sequence analysis  <cit> , we are able to distinguish between inhibitory and non-inhibitory serpins, available data in this study is insufficient to specify their preferred proteinase substrates. putative rcls and scissile bonds of serpins in this study were predicted based on consensus that there are  <dig> amino acid residues between the start of the rcl hinge region and the scissile bond  <cit> . as some of the characterized serpins such as α2-antiplasmin  <cit>  or serpin1k from manducca sexta  <cit> , utilize shorter rcls, we are interpreting our predictions of rcls and scissile bonds with caution.

our finding that 82% of the full-length serpins in this study have signal peptides is consistent with observations in humans where the majority of known serpins exist in the extracellular form  <cit> . findings in this study are not unique, in that similar results were reported in a. americanum where  <dig> of the  <dig> putatively inhibitory serpins in a. americanum were predicted to be extracellular  <cit> . from the perspective of finding target antigens for vaccine development, it is encouraging to note that the majority of i. scapularis serpins are putatively extracellular as they will be accessible to host immune response factors. predictions based on sequence analysis, may not be consistent with the situation in vivo. however it is interesting to note that the four serpin sequences  that were predicted to be intracellular sequences, based on lack of a signal peptide also posses "c" residues in the exposed regions of their rcl, a feature that has been observed in many intracellular serpins  <cit> .

the use of alternatively spliced rcls appears to be a wide spread strategy in insects to diversify the range of target proteinases that can be controlled by a single serpin gene  <cit> . a classic observation of this phenomenon is the serpin gene- <dig> of the tobacco hornworm, m. sexta, which has  <dig> different alternatively, spliced rcls  <cit> . effectively this gives rise to  <dig> serpins regulating  <dig> different proteolytic pathways. an interesting structural feature among the  <dig> variants of m. sexta serpin gene  <dig> is that the first  <dig> amino acids are exactly identical with difference restricted to the rcl  <cit> . the identity patterns among i. scapularis serpins sequences of where, stretches of identical and variable domains were spread across the entire sequence suggest that the diversity among serpins in this study may have arisen by duplication other than alternative splicing of rcl encoding exons.

from the perspective of understanding how the tick manipulates the mammalian host's defense against tick feeding, the finding of  <dig> serpins with basic residues at their p <dig> sites was exciting. in humans, this feature is associated with key serpins such as α1-antichymotrypsin, α1-antiplasmin, antithrombin iii, protein c inhibitor and c <dig> inhibitor  <cit> , which regulate important pathways such as inflammation, blood coagulation and complement activation. as these pathways are thought to represent the mammalian host's defense against tick feeding  <cit> , it is tempting to imagine that ticks could utilize some of these serpins to manipulate host defense to facilitate tick feeding and disease transmission. it is also possible that these serpins may not be directly be involved in facilitation of feeding. however, like their mammalian counterparts, they may be involved in regulation of important pathways in the tick, which if disrupted can affect the capacity of ticks as vectors.

although the biological significance of gene expression data will be strengthened if correlated with protein production, our rt-pcr data provide some useful insights on probable biological roles of serpin genes in this study in the physiology of i. scapularis. speculatively i. scapularis genes that were induced or up regulated after ticks had penetrated their host skin may signal their involvement in facilitation of blood meal up take. this is particularly true for the  <dig> genes that were induced in both sg and mg  or sg alone  in ticks that were fed for 6– <dig> hrs. this period corresponds to the preparatory feeding phase when tick attaches onto host skin and creates its feeding lesion  <cit> . during this period the tick must overcome inflammation and blood coagulation for it to successfully start the feeding process. similarly, the group of serpin genes  that were constitutively expressed but their transcript abundance increased with tick feeding may also play a role in facilitating blood meal up take. for those genes that were constitutively expressed, s <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the mg, and s <dig> in both sg and mg, but were progressively down regulated as ticks continued to feed, could be involved in regulating physiological processes at the front end of tick feeding process. the expression of s <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  specifically or predominantly in the mg is interesting as it signals the potential role for these genes in facilitation of not only blood meal processing, but also in the crossing of the gut barrier by pathogens. from the perspective of our long-term interest to find tick proteins that are used by ticks to evade host immunity, it was exciting to note that some serpins were specifically expressed in sg. it will be exciting to investigate whether or not any of these genes are injected into the host during tick feeding. it is possible that the genes analyzed here could be expressed in multiple tick organs besides the sg and mg. however, from the perspective of our long-term interests to understand molecular mechanisms that underlie tick-host interactions, our analysis here is biased to biological functions of serpins at the sg and mg levels. the sg is critical for feeding and disease transmission while the mg is important for blood meal processing and the passage of pathogens from the blood meal into the tick hemolymph  <cit> . our future questions will thus address the role of the serpins in facilitation of tick feeding and blood meal processing.

most known serpins are glycosylated  <cit>  and thus it is not surprising that  <dig> of the  <dig> serpin sequences that were tested are predicted to possess putative n-glycosyslation sites. as pool feeders, ticks accomplish feeding by lacerating small blood vessels and then sucking blood from the hematoma that forms in the feeding site  <cit> . in order to complete feeding, ticks must prevent host blood from coagulating to ensure continued blood flow into the hematoma for the entire tick feeding period, which may last for over the 10– <dig> and 4– <dig> day feeding periods for adults and immature ticks respectively  <cit> . from the perspective of solving the paradox of how the tick interferes with the coagulation cascade of its mammalian host, it was interesting to note that ~9%  of the sequences contain the rgd motif. previous studies have shown that tick proteins containing the rgd motif such as variabilin  <cit>  and savignygrin  <cit>  were potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation. platelet aggregation is critical to stopping bleeding of injured small blood vessels such as occurs at the tick bite  <cit> . thus, if functional, the rgd motif containing serpins could represent important molecular targets aimed at countering the ability of ticks to suppress the mammalian's host's blood clotting system. in addition to the anti-platelet aggregation function, rgd motif containing proteins are also involved in regulating cell-cell interactions in mammals  <cit> , immunity in arthropods  <cit> , and plants  <cit> . from the foregoing, it is clear that the rgd motif containing serpins could also be involved in regulation of multiple other functions in the tick, besides platelet function at the tick feeding site. it is interesting to note that our rt-pcr data suggested that the expression of three ) of the four serpin rgd motif-containing genes was responsive to tick feeding activity .

when compared to the  <dig> mbp human genome that encodes at least  <dig> serpin genes  <cit>  the  <dig> serpin genes identified in i. scapularis, which has a  <dig> mbp genome is considerably high. while the biological significance of the high number of serpin genes in the i. scapularis biology cannot be ascertained at present, we speculate that this may signal the significance of serpins in tick physiology. in light of lack of genome sequence data of many tick species, the sizes of tick serpin families will remain unknown. ticks are diverse, both in terms of their biology  <cit>  and their genome sizes  <cit> . thus it is likely that the sizes of serpin families in ticks are going to vary. however, this study provides some insight on the probable sizes of serpin families in ticks.
