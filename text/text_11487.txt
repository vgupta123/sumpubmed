BACKGROUND
potent effector cells among cd8+ αβ t cells, nk cells, nkt cells and γδ t cells each have specific mechanisms for identifying malignant or infected targets and sparing normal cells. common to all is the expression of cd <dig>  on the effector cell subset  <cit> . for example, cd56+ cd8+ t cells with high expression of perforin and granzyme b are potent cytotoxic effectors that possess an oligoclonal vβ chain repertoire  <cit> . nk cells lack t cell receptors  and rely instead on complex families of nkr and kir molecules to identify target cells  <cit> . the nkt cells express an invariant vα <dig> chain that is responsible for their cd- <dig> restricted responses to galactosyl ceramide  <cit> .

we are trying to understand tumor cell recognition by human vγ2vδ <dig> t cells . this population is dominated by cells expressing the vγ2-jγ <dig>  rearrangement which endows the mhc-unrestricted response to isoprenoid pyrophosphates  or synthetic aminobisphosphonates that cause accumulation of phosphoantigens, and specific human tumor cell lines  <cit> . despite complexity of the vγ <dig> chain cdr <dig> region  <cit> , individual cell clones respond similarly to phosphoantigens or tumor cells  <cit>  and it remains unclear how activated vγ2vδ <dig> cells discriminate normal from malignant cells and what controls cytotoxicity.

recently, we  <cit>  reported that cd <dig> was expressed on a potently cytotoxic subset of human vγ2vδ <dig> t cells, similar to what was reported for cd <dig> t cells  <cit> . however, strong proliferation responses to phosphoantigen occurred in both cd56+ and cd56- populations. this highly selected oligoclonal vγ2vδ <dig> + population responds uniformly to phosphoantigen, yet only ~50% of expanded cells express cd <dig> and lyse tumor cell targets. we imagined three alternative models to explain these observations: 1) cd <dig> expression is regulated stochastically perhaps by cytokine signals; 2) vγ2vδ <dig> t cell receptors vary in strength or specificity of antigen binding and these properties are related to control of cd <dig> expression; 3) cd <dig> is expressed only on ctl precursors that represent distinct subsets or lineages.

our initial approach for defining the cd56+ subpopulation used vγ <dig> sequences as markers for individual t cell clones. vγ2vδ <dig> t cell lines were generated from pbmc by phosphoantigen treatment and separated into cd56+ and cd56- fractions. a sample of vγ <dig> chains from each fraction was cloned and sequenced. if the same vγ <dig> sequences are detected in both fractions, expression of cd <dig> must be regulated stochastically, in accordance with model  <dig> . if the vγ <dig> chain repertoire is distinct between the cd56+ and cd56- fractions, we need to test whether a previously missed antigen specificity within the vγ2vδ <dig> repertoire dictates cd <dig> expression and tumor cell cytolysis. for testing the latter, we can exploit the observation that human vγ <dig> repertoire has a high proportion of public clonotypes with complete cdr <dig> region identity among unrelated individuals  <cit> . by comparing phenotypes for cells expressing public clonotypes, in terms of whether they express cd <dig> similarly among unrelated individuals, we learn whether tcr specificity dictates cd <dig> expression.

our results argue that individual vγ2vδ <dig> t cell clones are already committed to either the cd56+ or cd56- subset. commitment is not due to special properties of the tcr but seems, within the limits of our analysis, to be a property distinct to each clone. the circulating vγ2vδ <dig> t cell pool is the result of chronic, positive selection  <cit>  and individual clones seem to be long-lived--at least  <dig> years in adults  <cit> . thus, the mechanisms controlling cd <dig> expression can have long-term impact on the capacity for tumor cell cytotoxicity.

methods
pbmc isolation, in vitro ipp stimulation and expansion of vγ2vδ <dig> t cells
whole blood was obtained with written consent from healthy human volunteers and approved by the institutional review board at the university of maryland school of medicine. donors studied here are representative of the specimen collection in our laboratory. total lymphocytes were separated from heparinized peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation . isolated pbmc were then cultured at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in rpmi- <dig> media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig> u/ml streptomycin  and  <dig> u/ml recombinant human interleukin- <dig>  . to stimulate pbmc,  <dig> μm of isopentenyl pyrophosphate   were added. cultures were incubated for  <dig> days at 37°c with 5% co <dig> and media with il- <dig> was replenished every 3- <dig> days. cell proliferation was confirmed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies specific for vγ <dig> , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , and isotype-matched, igg controls. at least  <dig> ×  <dig> lymphocytes were analyzed per sample on a facscalibur flow cytometer . flow cytometry data were analyzed using flowjo software.

cell separation and dna synthesis
fresh pbmc and cell lines obtained after ipp stimulation were separated into cd56+ and cd56- populations using magnetic bead techniques. specifically,  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> cells were treated with anti-cd <dig> conjugated to pe  at  <dig> μl/ <dig> cells, followed by magnetic-bead labeled anti-pe  at  <dig> μl/ <dig> cells. labeled cells were passed through a magnetic column and fractions were collected. this procedure was repeated to achieve highest possible purity. total rna was extracted from at least  <dig> ×  <dig> cd56+ or cd56- cells using rneasy mini kits  according to the manufacturer's instructions. one μg of total rna was converted to cdna using a reverse transcription kit . each reaction was incubated at 42°c for  <dig> min and then diluted with rnase/dnase free h2o to a total volume of  <dig> μl. five μl of cdna served as the template for subsequent pcr reaction to amplify the vγ <dig> t cell chain using  <dig>  μm vγ <dig> forward primer  and  <dig>  μm cγ <dig> reverse primer  under the following cycling conditions:  <dig> min denaturation at 94°c,  <dig> cycles of  <dig> min at 94°c,  <dig> min at 60°c, and  <dig> min at 72°c, followed by a final elongation for  <dig> min at 72°c amplitaq gold .

cloning and sequencing
pcr products were separated on 1% agarose gels and purified using a qiaquick gel extraction kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. purified products were denatured for  <dig> min at 94°c, incubated for  <dig> min at 72°c with  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm datps,  <dig>  u amplitaq gold, then ligated into the pcr <dig>  cloning vector. the ligated vector was transfected into top10f' competent e. coli cells  and bacterial colonies were grown overnight on agar plates containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin,  <dig> μm isopropylthiogalactoside  and  <dig> μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactopyranoside . white colonies, containing the recombinant plasmid, were cultured overnight in lb supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin, then plasmid dna was purified using real  <dig> miniprep kits . sequencing reactions used the big dye v <dig>  fluorescent sequencing kit  with the m <dig> forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers. sequences were analyzed on an abi <dig> sequencer and aligned using sequencher and macvector software. in total, approximately  <dig>  vγ <dig> sequences were annotated, aligned and compared during this study.

daudi cultures
the b cell lymphoma cell line, daudi, was obtained from atcc . cells were cultured at 37°c with 5% co <dig> at a concentration between  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. cultures were kept in rpmi- <dig> media supplemented with 10% fbs, pcr extension temp to 72°,  <dig> mm l-glutamate,  <dig>  g/l glucose,  <dig>  g/l nahco <dig>   <dig> mm hepes, and  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate . cells were cultured for no more than  <dig> passages.

γδ t cell cloning
γδ t cells clones were obtained following a previously published procedure  <cit> , with some modifications. specifically, pbmc were isolated from whole blood as described above. using the macs system and the vγ <dig> monoclonal antibody conjugated to pe, we isolated the vγ <dig> + fraction of cells. the cells were incubated in media overnight at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  in a 96-well v-bottom microtiter plate ,  <dig> cell/well of the vγ2+ population was obtained by limiting dilution and combined with  <dig> × 105/well irradiated  autologous pbmc and  <dig> × 104/well irradiated  daudi in a total volume of  <dig> μl.  <dig> μm ipp and  <dig> u/ml il- <dig> was also added to each well. the plates were incubated for  <dig> days at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  wells that showed signs of cell proliferation were analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of vγ <dig>  vδ <dig>  cd <dig>  nkg2d, and nkg2a . clonality of the population was determined by sequencing of the vγ <dig> cdr <dig> region.

flow cytometric cytotoxicity assay
due to the low cell numbers generated by cloning, and the fragility of the cloned γδ t cells when re-expanded, cytotoxicity of the individual γδ t cell clones was measured using a flow cytometry based assay. in this assay,  <dig> ×  <dig> daudi target cells were labeled with cfse  and then combined in a 96-well microtiter plate  with vγ <dig> cell effectors at effector to target ratios varying from 10: <dig> to  <dig> : <dig>  reactions to control for spontaneous lysis included only the cfse-labeled targets and medium. plates were incubated at 37°c with 5% co <dig> for  <dig> hours. after the incubation,  <dig> ul of 18% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline were added to inactive effector cells, then we added  <dig>  ×  <dig> daudi cells that had been labeled with pkh <dig> . cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry, measuring the proportions of green  and red  labeled daudi cells. a decrease in the proportion of green:red indicated cytotoxicity of the added vγ2+ cells. specific lysis was determined by comparing the ratio of pkh26-labeled reference cells with cfse-labeled target cells in the following formula:  ×  <dig> 

RESULTS
asymmetric cd <dig> expression in vγ2vδ <dig> t cells
the vγ2vδ2+ cell lines obtained after phosphoantigen stimulation of pbmc contain cd56+ and cd56- subsets. these subsets were separated by magnetic bead sorting and the tcr repertoire was characterized by cloning and sequencing a sample of the vγ <dig> chains in each fraction. the dna sequences were aligned and translated into amino acid sequences representing the individual clonotypes found for each donor. the most abundant clonotypes from each donor and whether they appear in cd56+ or cd56- fractions are shown .

as expected, we found both private  and public  clonotypes among these vγ <dig> chains. public clonotypes match at all positions including the cdr <dig> region encoded partly by non-templated nucleotides. public vγ <dig> clonotypes found in these data sets include wev---qelg, wev---r---elg and we---a---qelg. we refer to wev---qelg as the "canonical" clonotype because it is mostly encoded by germline sequences without deletion of v or j segments and without nucleotide additions. among  <dig> donors, public vγ <dig> clonotypes appeared  <dig> times. in  <dig> of  <dig> examples, the clonotypes appeared in both cd56+ and cd56- fractions with < 2-fold difference in frequency between the  <dig> fractions. in the remaining  <dig> of  <dig>  appearances, the public clonotype was more abundant in either cd56+ or cd56- fractions--a condition referred to as asymmetry. among these  <dig> donors, we found  <dig> highly abundant private vγ <dig> clonotypes. of the private clonotypes,  <dig>  were distributed asymmetrically .

these data suggested that public clonotypes were associated randomly with cd56+ or cd56- fractions or distributed symmetrically, but private clonotypes were distributed asymmetrically into the two subsets. however, only a single sample from each donor was analyzed, so we could not determine if the association with cd <dig> expression was stable. to address this issue, we needed to concentrate on a smaller number of donors to complete more extensive studies including replicate sampling. we selected donors nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd <dig> as representatives of the donor pool.

stably expressed vγ <dig> chain sequences can be used to compare cd56+ and cd56- subsets
we compared vγ <dig> clonotype  frequencies among three healthy donors in samples collected approximately  <dig> year apart using 200- <dig> vγ <dig> chain cdna clones from each specimen. the vγ <dig> chain cdna from pbmc or ipp-stimulated cell lines were cloned into plasmids and sequenced individually. the frequencies for individual vγ <dig> clonotypes were calculated as a proportion of the total number of sequences obtained from each cell sample. only clonotypes found at a frequency of 3% or greater were studied; below that level, frequency values are less reproducible due to sampling errors. clonotypes detected in ipp-expanded lines from both  <dig> and  <dig> time points were also deemed stable. frequencies for each stable clonotype from three donors nd <dig>  nd <dig>  and nd <dig> are shown . in each case, the proliferation response to ipp was similar at both time points for each clonotype.

vγ <dig> chain clonotypes  are shown for donors nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd <dig>  for each clonotype, we show the proportion of all vγ <dig> chains represented by that clonotype for specimens collected in  <dig> or  <dig>  clonotype abundance for ex vivo and post-expansion samples are shown. the n values represent the total number of vγ <dig> chain dna sequences obtained for each specimen.

cd <dig> positive and negative fractions from individual donors contain distinct vγ <dig> clonotypes
we next measured the frequencies for individual clonotypes in cd56+ and cd56- subsets. pbmc collected  <dig> year apart and the resulting ipp-expanded cell lines were fractionated into cd56+ and cd56- populations using magnetic bead cell separation. the vγ <dig> chain mrnas were amplified by pcr, cloned in plasmid vectors and sequenced to determine the frequency of individual vγ <dig> clonotypes within the population.

the most common vγ <dig> clonotypes from donors nd <dig>  nd <dig>  and nd <dig> are shown . if a particular clonotype was more abundant in one fraction by a difference greater than 2: <dig>  it was assigned as cd56+ or cd56- as appropriate. clonotype distributions varied among donors. in nd <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig>  stable clonotypes expanded preferentially into either cd56+ or cd56- fractions. in nd <dig> and nd <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  stable clonotypes showed this asymmetry. the patterns for clonotype distribution were consistent over the 1-year sampling period. for example, the nd <dig> clonotype calw---sr---elg was  <dig> times more frequent in the  <dig> cd56+ fraction and was  <dig> times more frequent in  <dig>  calwe---te---elg was in the cd56- population at similar frequencies for both time points.

we next looked at clonotypes where there was no clear bias toward cd56+ or cd56- fractions , the so-called "inconclusive" clonotypes. many of these are public clonotypes that is, they are present in more than one donor. in our experience, public clonotypes are usually encoded by more than one nucleotide sequence . we examined vγ <dig> nucleotypes for each public clonotype and calculated their respective frequencies . nucleotype analysis explained the behavior for some of the inconclusive clonotypes. for example, the nd <dig> clonotype calwe---a---qelg was skewed to the cd56+ population in a  <dig> ipp-expanded specimen, but was less biased in a  <dig> sample . singling out its most abundant nucleotype, gcc---caa, we see it was skewed to the cd56+ population in both samples at frequencies of 12% to < 3% and 6% to < 3%, respectively . clearly, this nucleotype was committed to the cd56+ phenotype even if the overall clonotype appeared unbiased. other nucleotypes  behaved differently in the  <dig> and  <dig> specimens causing them to appear inconclusive i.e., observable in both cd56+ and cd56- fractions. the nd <dig> clonotype calwev---r---elg was found in both cd56+ and cd56- populations. however, we identified a major nucleotype, gtg---cga that was more common in the cd56- population . again the distinct behavior of individual nucleotypes confused the clonotype analysis. we cannot always analyze the distribution of every nucleotype within a public clonotype because some are infrequent, but this level of analysis supported the view that cd <dig> expression is not a random marker and most of the individual nucleotypes each have distinct expression of cd <dig> 

nucleotype analyses explained most but not all of the inconclusive clonotypes. the public canonical sequence, calwev---qelg, is the vγ2-jγ <dig>  germline sequence without junctional nucleotides. it was not consistently segregated into cd56+ or cd56- fractions for any donor at the clonotype  or nucleotype  levels. early γδ cell ontogeny is characterized by a high frequency of canonical recombinations  <cit> . therefore, the presence of this vγ <dig> chain sequence does not imply clonality because it likely arises again and again throughout life. other inconclusive clonotypes, such as calwev---d---elg and calwev---rk---lg were distributed differently in  <dig> compared with the  <dig> specimens. these clonotypes are each encoded by a single nucleotype, implying they represent a single clone of cells. whether clones can change in terms of the capacity to express cd <dig> or whether new clones arose with the same nucleotype, cannot be discerned from our data. however, most of the clones we observed had the same phenotype in pbmc collected  <dig> year apart and the capacity for cd <dig> expression appears to be stable.

identical vγ <dig> nucleotypes are present among unrelated donors
we observed a number of identical vγ <dig> chains among unrelated donors. for example, the nucleotype gtg---cgg---gag was in all  <dig> donors . in nd <dig>  it was the most abundant nucleotype encoding the public clonotype calwev---r---elg. in donor nd <dig>  it was equally abundant as the gtg---cga---gag nucleotype. individual nucleotypes encoding the public clonotype calwe---a---qelg were also found in multiple donors . the canonical nucleotype  was abundantly present in all  <dig> donors, but this was not surprising, given the high frequency of canonical recombinations during ontogeny. interestingly, the canonical clonotype  was not always the product of germline sequences, as non-canonical nucleotypes also encoded this chain .

vγ <dig> chain sequence did not predict cd <dig> expression
we evaluated in three donors whether public clonotypes appear consistently in either cd56+ or cd56- subsets. the clonotype calwe---a---qelg is a useful example . in nd <dig>  this clonotype  was predominantly in the cd56- population. in nd <dig> the dominant nucleotype  was in the cd56+ population. nd <dig> is unusual in that the clonotype's dominant nucleotype  was in the cd56- population of the  <dig> sample and in the cd56+ population of  <dig>  this suggests that individual clones can switch to a different committed phenotype or a new clone arose with the same cdr <dig> region sequence. since we have observed identical nucleotypes in unrelated donors, it is assumed that the same sequences can be generated more than once in a single donor and we expect to find some nucleotypes with inconsistent behavior.

our data suggest that the ability of vγ2vδ <dig> t cells to express cd <dig> can be separated from the strength of proliferative responses received through the tcr. after expanding the vγ2vδ <dig> subset by ipp, the nd <dig> clonotype calw--sr---elg increased to  <dig> % of the vγ <dig> positive population . the calwe---t---qelg expressing cells also increased to a frequency of 21%. however, the expanded calw---sr---elg cells expressed cd <dig>  and the calwe---t---qelg cells remained cd <dig> negative . we have observed examples of rapidly proliferating cells in both cd56+ and cd56- subsets and strength of response to phosphoantigen does not appear to influence cd <dig> expression.

il <dig> alone induces cd <dig> expression, but the repertoire is distinct from phosphoantigen expanded cell lines
we noted that culture with il- <dig> alone did not expand the vγ2+ cells  but did induce cd <dig> expression on vγ2vδ <dig> cells . il- <dig>  a cytokine that enhances both proliferation and effector functions of αβ t cells and another member of the common γ chain cytokines, also induced cd <dig> expression on γδ t cells  <cit> . this suggests that signaling through the vγ2vδ <dig> tcr is not required for expression of cd <dig> and encouraged us to understand the clone complexity of il-2-treated cd56+ cells. we compared the vγ <dig> repertoire of cd56-depleted pbmc treated with il- <dig> alone to the ipp-expanded cell lines to test this hypothesis.

we depleted cd56+ cells from pbmc with magnetic bead separation. the remaining cd56- cells were treated with il- <dig>  the il- <dig> alone caused little to no proliferation of the vγ2+ population. in contrast, ipp + il- <dig> stimulation caused significant expansion, with vγ2+ cells making up  <dig> to 90% of pbmc by  <dig> days after stimulation . despite the lack of significant expansion, by day  <dig> the il-2-only treated vγ <dig> cells had increased expression of cd <dig> . we next tested whether similar clonotypes were present in cd56+ or cd56- fractions after il- <dig> alone compared to ipp + il- <dig> stimulation.

clonotype frequencies were starkly different for the il- <dig> treated pbmc compared with cell lines obtained after ipp + il- <dig> . calwev---d---elg was the dominant clonotype in pbmc from nd <dig> and ipp-expanded vγ <dig> cells with frequencies of 36% and 23% respectively. in the il-2-only culture, the frequency of this clonotype dropped to 2%. in nd <dig>  a dominant clonotype calwev---qelg, fell from  <dig> % in pbmc, to < 3% in the il-2-only culture. for nd <dig>  the total frequency of peripheral vγ2-jγ <dig>  t cells dropped from 87% to  <dig> % following il- <dig> treatment . for nd <dig>  the dominant pbmc clonotypes, calw---sr---elg and calwe---a---elg, were still present at high frequencies after il- <dig> but other ipp-inducible clonotypes including calwev---qelg, calwe---t---qelg and calwe---te---qelg were distinctly low after il- <dig> treatment.

vγ <dig> chains from donor pbmc, ipp-stimulated cell lines, and il- <dig> only treated cells were sequenced. individual vγ <dig> clonotypes frequencies for stable clonotypes were calculated as a proportion of total sequences obtained from each donor sample. any sequences present at a frequency below 3% are under the limits of detection for this assay. the total numbers of sequences analyzed for each sample are listed.

cd56+ vγ2vδ <dig> cells clones are cytotoxic for daudi cells
so far, studies have focused on the vγ <dig> repertoire as a marker for clonality. next, we examined individual biological clones of vγ2vδ <dig> t cells to confirm the link between cd <dig> expression and cytotoxicity.

our initial efforts to obtain clones used pha stimulation followed by limiting dilution on feeder cells  <cit> . we acquired a small number of clones with this method--9/ <dig> being cd56+ and 18/ <dig> being cd56-. the vγ <dig> chain sequences were determined and in each case, the phenotype  and the vγ <dig> sequence of the clone matched what was found in the population analysis . unfortunately, none of these clones could be expanded to the levels needed for cytotoxicity assays. we repeated the cloning using ipp stimulation and plating on feeder cells. after multiple cloning efforts with pbmc from two different donors , we obtained  <dig> clones that were phenotyped, had vγ <dig> chain sequencing to confirm clonality and were used for cytotoxicity assays. every clone expressed cd <dig> above the mean fluorescence intensity of  <dig>  which is the usual cut-off for cell separations, suggesting that cells from the cd56+ subset had a higher cloning efficiency compared to cd56- cells. the clones all expressed nkg2d, a receptor required for vγ2vδ <dig> t cell cytotoxicity  <cit> , with the percentage of nkg2d+ cells varying from 16% to 82% of cloned cells . with the exception of clone 1-g <dig>  all clones were cytotoxic for daudi cells. further, each of the cd56+ clones had a vγ <dig> sequence that was matched to a sequence found in the cd56+ fraction of that donor's total vγ2+ cell population. despite representing approximately 50% of the vγ2vδ <dig> t cell population, the cloning studies produced few cd56- clones and they could not be expanded. cloning studies showed that cd <dig> expression in clones was matched to the same vγ <dig> clonotypes observed in purified sub-populations, and all of the cd56+ clones were cytotoxic for daudi cell targets.

discussion
the cd <dig> cell surface glycoprotein is a marker for cytotoxic vγ2vδ <dig> t cells  <cit> . within the circulating t cell population, individual vγ2vδ <dig> t cells fell mostly into two groups: precursor ctl effectors that express cd <dig> upon activation and cells that do not express cd <dig>  for each human donor, cells identified by vγ <dig> sequences mostly showed the same propensity for cd <dig> expression in samples collected  <dig> year apart, arguing that this property is stable. thus, cd <dig> is not regulated stochastically on vγ2vδ <dig> t cells, but reflects a stable phenotype of individual cells in the population.

the next step was to discern whether cd <dig> is expressed on cells with unique tcr specificities. there was no fixed relationship between individual public vγ <dig> chains and cd <dig> expression. further, some of these chains defined populations present in both cd56+ and cd56- fractions. individual nucleotypes showed a trend for appearing in cd56+ or cd56- fractions but not both, arguing that the capacity for cd <dig> expression was a pre-existing feature of individual cells i.e., they were precursors.

the analysis of nucleotypes provided the surprising result that unrelated donors express identical nucleotypes. such events are known for nkt cells where the invariant vα <dig> chain is the germ-line sequence without deletions or n-region additions  <cit> . for vγ <dig> chains, conserved cdr <dig> regions may be due to limited deletion during recombination  <cit>  and strong selection for these sequences since most of the n-region additions in these examples only affect the wobble base and do not change the amino acid sequence. there is strong selection for leucine, valine or isoleucine at position  <dig> in the vδ <dig> chain cdr <dig> region and the conserved residues are believed important for phosphoantigen recognition  <cit> . in our study, the appearance of identical nucleotypes among unrelated donors complicates the analysis. if a sequence can arise in multiple donors, it seems likely that the same sequence can arise more than once in a single donor. for public nucleotypes, the individual vγ <dig> chain sequence does not necessarily identify a single clone and complex properties must be expected.

the analysis of vγ <dig> chain sequences showed overall, that individual clones of vγ2+ cells in pbmc either had or did not have the capacity to express cd <dig> and become cytotoxic effectors. whether this defines a lineage is unclear. among t cells, lineage generally defines events during early cell differentiation. recent studies in the mouse showed the capacity for il-17/il- <dig> expression defined a γδ t cell lineage  <cit> . the patterns for thymic cd <dig> expression and engagement with its ligand cd <dig>  dictated entry into a cytotoxic γδ t cell lineage in mice  <cit> , arguing that early events dictate the long-term outcome. therefore, in the mouse, γδ t cell cytotoxicity is lineage-restricted. the human vγ2vδ <dig> repertoire contains few if any, naïve cells as it is the product of extensive extrathymic selection  <cit> . the cd <dig> marker is rarely expressed in human cord blood γδ t cells  and presumably reflects a subsequent developmental stage. our studies cannot explain whether the capacity for cd <dig> expression arose early or late, and consequently, we hesitate to describe precursors to the cd56+ subset as comprising a lineage.

there was an intriguing trend between cd <dig> expression and clonotype frequency. presumably the result of strong positive selection, the more abundant clonotypes tended to express cd <dig>  this may reflect the increased apoptosis-resistance of cd56+ vγ2vδ <dig> cells  <cit> , a trend also seen in cd56+ αβ t cells. the result of selection is an oligoclonal population of tumor effector cells that are stably maintained in the cd56+ fraction.

whether vγ2vδ <dig> t cells belong to innate or acquired immunity is an enduring question in this field  <cit> . with a high proportion of cells expressing the vγ2-jγ <dig> vδ <dig> tcr there is an innate like response to phosphoantigen. however, there is clear evidence for selection and amplification of discrete subsets, including the vγ2-jγ <dig>  rearrangement  <cit> . our studies reported here show that chronic selection produces a population with phosphoantigen-specific tcr, but other mechanisms, likely operating before peripheral selection, dictate the potential for cytotoxicity and cd <dig> expression. thus, the vγ2vδ <dig> tcr is necessary for tumor cell cytotoxicity because cell activation by antigen is required to develop effector function. however, cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic cells both proliferate in response to phosphoantigen. owing to the greater complexity in αβ tcr repertoire, it is difficult to perform the same tracking studies, but it would be interesting to learn whether epitope-specific cd <dig> αβ t cells also display differences in cd <dig> expression that control cytotoxicity.

CONCLUSIONS
prior to selection and amplification mechanisms that shape the adult γδ t cell repertoire, individual clones are committed to the cytotoxic or non-cytotoxic lineages. lineage commitment was not related to tcr specificity, as cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic precursors responded similarly to phosphoantigen stimulation. the mature population of vγ2vδ <dig> t cells includes committed precursors capable of expressing cd <dig> and cytolytic effector activity against tumor cells.
