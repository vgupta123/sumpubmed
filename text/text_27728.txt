BACKGROUND
tef, eragrostis tef  trotter, is a major food grain in ethiopia but is a minor cereal crop worldwide. the primary use of tef is for grinding into flour to make injera, a spongy fermented flat bread that is a staple food for most ethiopians. the vegetative portions of the plant are also an important source of fodder for livestock. in ethiopia for the crop year 2003– <dig>  it occupied two million hectares, which represented 28% of the area grown with eight cereal crops in the country  <cit> . the ability of tef to perform well on both waterlogged vertisols in the highlands as well as water-stressed areas in the semi-arid regions throughout the country is one of the reasons for which tef is preferred over other grain crops such as maize or barley  <cit> . in addition, tef generally suffers less from biotic stresses compared to most other cereal crops grown in ethiopia and it contains high levels of proteins and mineral  <cit> .

tef is an allotetraploid species with a base chromosome number of  <dig> . it belongs to the family poaceae, sub-family eragrostidae and genus eragrostis. the genus contains approximately  <dig> species  <cit> . the exact diploid progenitors of tef are still unknown; however, most researchers agree that e. pilosa is the species most closely related to e. tef and is considered the direct wild tetraploid progenitor of tef  <cit> . it is also the only species known to be cross-compatible with modern tef varieties. flow cytometry research has shown that tef has a genome size of  <dig> mbp  <cit> , which is roughly the same size as diploid sorghum and about 60% larger than the diploid rice genome. it has also the smallest chromosomes reported among the poaceae ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm  <cit> , which has significantly hindered the cytogenetic research of this species.

understanding the genetic control of agronomic traits is essential for the sustained improvement of tef. lodging is the number one cause of yield loss in tef; even with good crop management practices. recent studies in tef have shown strong correlations between lodging, panicle type, culm thickness, and grain yield  <cit> . important agronomic traits in tef, as in most crop species, are quantitative inherited  <cit> , which complicates genetic analysis. quantitative trait locus  analysis allows the identification of discrete chromosome segments controlling complex traits  <cit> . the significance of identifying qtls that correspond with certain traits is that the information can be used for marker-assisted selection  program. this is the most comprehensive report of qtl analyses for agronomic traits in tef to date.

cultivated tef and the wild species, e. pilosa, differ greatly for most agronomic traits and the close relationship betweenthese two species facilitate hybridization providing a unique opportunity to develop a new pool of genetic variation. the study by tefera et al.  <cit>  has demonstrated that e. pilosa has contributed useful breeding traits, such as earliness and short stature. therefore, utilization of e. pilosa as a donor in an inter-specific cross is a useful strategy for broadening the genetic diversity of the existing gene pool in cultivated tef.

the purpose of this research was to identify and characterize qtls controlling  <dig> agronomic traits; eight yield-related traits and  <dig> morphological traits, in the inter-specific cross between e tef, cv. kaye murri and e. pilosa .

RESULTS
trait analysis
effects of years and locations were highly significant  for all traits evaluated in multiple locations . the variance among lines was highly significant  for all traits except rpr <dig>  rpr <dig>  and crush <dig> . the mean value of the two parents, kaye murri and e. pilosa  were significantly different for all  <dig> traits . as expected for an inter-specific cross, distribution of phenotypic values in the progeny showed bi-directional transgressive segregants for all traits, except crush <dig> and crush <dig>  which showed transgressive segregants towards the e. pilosa  parent only.

phenotypic correlations were estimated between the overall means of the  <dig> phenotypic traits. all traits, except rpr <dig> and rpr <dig>  were highly correlated  with at least one other trait. significant positive correlations were identified between yield and most agronomic traits except pedl and dia in this population . lodging was not correlated with traits supposedly lodging related, such as ph, rpr <dig>   <dig> and crush <dig>   <dig> . the frequency distributions of most of traits fit the normal distribution, however, seven traits  were significantly skewed, and transformation was applied prior to qtl analysis except rpr <dig> and  <dig>  the traits, rpr <dig>  rpr <dig> and crush <dig> were excluded for qtl analyses which did not show variances among lines thus,  <dig> traits were evaluated for qtl analyses.

qtl for grain yield and yield related traits
heading date  and maturity date 
two md qtls were identified at three locations representative of all three agro-ecologies. the md qtl on lg <dig> at  <dig>  cm explained  <dig>  of r <dig>  and was associated with yield related traits such as pwt and sb . early maturity is a common characteristic of wild relatives of tef and e. pilosa  matured on average  <dig> days earlier than kaye murri. on the other hand, at the qtl for hd, the allele from e. pilosa contributed longer cycle.

panicle weight 
five qtls were identified for pwt on lg <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and r <dig> ranged from 14% to 23%. the qtl interval on lg <dig> , was associated with two yield related traits and six morphological traits. all five qtls were overlapped or closely located with the qtls for pswt. three of the qtls were positively affected by kaye murri resulting in weight increase.

panicle seed weight 
nine qtls were identified for pswt covering all three agro-ecologies with six locations. out of seven qtls that were associated with gy, five kaye murri qtls showed a positive effect. four pswt qtls were associated with pwt and two overlapped with gy qtls. however, there was no qtl associated with 100sw.

 <dig> seed weight 
four qtls were identified for 100sw, all of which were increased by the alleles of the cultivated parent. no 100sw qtl were associated with pwt, pswt or gy qtl.

grain yield 
the largest number of qtls was identified for gy, among the traits studied. twelve qtls were identified in nine linkage groups. the highest lod score was  <dig>  for issr549b explaining  <dig>  of r <dig>  two qtls in lg <dig>   <dig> cm apart, were significant in six locations representing three agro-ecologies. the e. pilosa  alleles in lg <dig>  and lg <dig>  increased grain yield. the rest of the qtls were positively affected by the kaye murri alleles.

shoot biomass 
the most significant qtls for sb were found on lg <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with a lod >  <dig> and r <dig> >  <dig> . one qtl on lg <dig>  explained  <dig>  of r <dig> and the positive allele was from e. pilosa . this qtl co-located with pwt, pswt and gy qtls, all with same positive alleles from e. pilosa .

lodging index 
three qtls were located on lg <dig> and  <dig>  and two qtls were associated with unlinked loci. all five qtl alleles contributed by kaye murri increased lodging. the two qtls  on lg <dig> were located in the distal region of the linkage group. palb showed the highest r <dig>  and highest lod score  and co-segregated with md. tcd <dig> co-located with sb and gy, and was located near eight other qtls, including lodging related traits, such as crush <dig> 

qtl for morphological and plant height related traits
culm length 
eight significant culml qtls were identified on seven linkage groups and one unlinked locus . the r <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . except for rz <dig> on lg <dig>  increasing effects of all significant qtls came from kaye murri. the strongest culml qtl is tcd <dig> on lg <dig> with a lod score of  <dig>  and an r <dig> value of  <dig> . this locus was associated with pswt, inter <dig>  gy and sb.

culm diameter 1st and 2nd internode 
two and one qtls were associated with cd <dig> and cd <dig>  respectively and were identified only in the c2- <dig> agro-ecology zone. these traits share common qtl regions on lg <dig> and the allele for thicker culms was contributed by kaye murri.

peduncle length 
eleven significant qtls were identified on six linkage groups and five of the qtls were associated with unlinked loci. the r <dig> for pedl ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . at seven qtls, e. pilosa  alleles increased pedl. among these, two qtls in lg <dig> and  <dig> were negatively associated with other traits .

panicle length 
seven qtls were identified for panl, with a maximum r <dig> of  <dig>  and lod =  <dig> for rz <dig> in lg <dig>  kaye murri alleles increased panl in all qtls, except for rz <dig>  and rz <dig> . six panl qtls were associated with several yield-related traits.

plant height 
four significant qtls were identified with r <dig> ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . kaye murri alleles at qtls in lg <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> increased ph while the e. pilosa  allele increased ph at rz <dig> . all ph qtls were associated with qtls for multiple yield-related traits.

number of internodes 
three qtls were associated with ninter. the most significant qtl  was on lg <dig> which was associated with ph.

1st and 2nd internode length 
three and seven qtls were identified for inter <dig> and inter <dig>  respectively. these qtls overlapped in lg <dig> where the r <dig> was about  <dig> , and longer internode length resulted from the e. pilosa allele. the unlinked locus rz <dig> was also associated with both of these traits.

crown diameter 
only one qtl, issr548a in lg <dig>  was detected for dia. this locus was associated with qtls for nine different traits; pwt, pswt, culml, panl, ph, gy, sb, lodg and crush <dig> . most of these qtls were unique to the dzbs location. kaye murri alleles increased crown diameter.

crushing strength at the 2nd internodes 
two qtls were identified for crush <dig>  the traits of rpr and crush were measured to evaluate the strength of culm in order to evaluate lodging resistance. however, qtls for crush <dig>  were not co-localized with qtls for lodg. rpr <dig>  rpr <dig> and crush <dig> did not show phenotypic variances among lines thus, qtl analyses were not available.

discussion
single marker analysis  detects associations between individual markers and traits; therefore, it does not require a genetic map to be applied. in this study we used smr for a preliminary test of significance of all polymorphic markers. for the loci that mapped into linkage groups  <cit> , composite interval mapping  could be applied for detection and mapping of qtls. permutation tests were conducted to establish significant thresholds for cim, reducing the chance of reporting false qtls. in addition, multiple-trait analysis  was used to analyze qtl over experiments, for detection of loci that consistently affected the phenotype across environments. the significant qtls identified by all three analyses in common are presented herein .

tef improvement has relied mostly on mass selection from landraces for the development of new varieties. the grain yield of tef has risen from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kg/ha over  <dig> years of breeding  <cit> . the average rate of yield increase per year for the period of  <dig> to  <dig> was estimated at  <dig>  kg/ha , using linear regression of mean grain yield of cultivars on year of release. this gain is similar to rates reported for spring barley, oat and spring durum wheat in ethiopia  <cit> . however, the national average grain yield of tef is still about  <dig>  t/ha  <cit>  and is not competitive with that of other major grain crops.

grain yield was significantly correlated with all traits except pedl . the associations of gy with hd, md, pwt, pswt, 100sw, sb, culml, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  panl, ph, inter <dig>  inter <dig> and crush <dig> indicated that later maturing, taller, more vigorous, and larger plants resulted in more grain yield. tefera et al.  <cit>  showed most yield and yield related traits had high broad-sense heritability  in the population used in this study, and moderate to high h values were obtained in a population derived from an intra-specific cross. as expected, improvement of yield potential in tef has been associated with an increase of biomass yield and yield components. among the  <dig> qtls identified,  <dig> gy qtls were detected in nine different linkage groups . the map positions of the qtls for yield related traits and sb on the same chromosomes overlapped, thus supporting the significant phenotypic correlations  .

several chromosomal regions were associated with more than two traits indicating either linkage or pleiotropic effect. clusters of qtls  for various traits were identified on lg <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . previous studies in cereal crops such as rice and wheat have also shown a clustering of agronomic qtls  <cit> . the same chromosome region on lg <dig> was associated with positive and negative qtl alleles from e. tef for gy and pedl, respectively , although the correlation between those two traits was non-significant . the pedl qtl showed a similar relationship on lg <dig> with those of 100sw and sb which are yield related components. the association of two positive qtl effects in the same chromosomal region was reported for studies involving o. rufipogon in rice  <cit> . the allele of o. rufipogon had a beneficial effect where the increasing effect for grain yield was linked to decreasing effect for plant height  <cit> . however, in some cases beneficial qtls from o. rufipogon were associated with undesirable qtls. for example, a qtl increasing panicle length qtl was in the same region as a qtl increasing the proportion of broken grains  <cit> . where associations of desirable and undesirable agronomic qtls are in the same chromosomal regions, careful selection would be needed to avoid undesirable characteristics in the derived lines.

epistasis is part of the genetic architecture of grain yield and other agronomic traits. gene interaction has also been reported for a few phenotypic traits of tef  <cit>  thus, it is not surprising to detect it for more complex quantitative characters in this study  <cit> . an analysis to identify the potential epistatic interactions between qtls identified  <dig> marker loci resulting in  <dig> two-way interactions . gy qtls had five two-way interactions and tcd <dig> and lfm <dig> were actively involved in the epistasis. the most interesting interaction was between tcd <dig> on lg <dig>  and tcd227a on lg <dig>  for gy qtls, because this was shown for sb qtl interaction as well . in addition, qtls on lg <dig> for gy and sb were detected in all three agro-ecology zones where agronomic traits were measured for this study. likewise, the gy qtl  on lg <dig> was detected across all three agro-ecologies and had significant interaction with tcd227a in lg <dig>  therefore, to improve grain yield, these three qtls may need to be selected together.

genotype and environment interaction could influence the ability to detect qtls, even though tef displays versatile agro-ecological adoption with good resilience to both low and high moisture stress. individual qtls were not consistently detected across environments, and inconsistent qtl detection has been observed and attributed to qtl × environment interaction, which has been commonly observed in other grain yield qtl studies in cereal crops. out of  <dig> gy qtls, only two qtls  were consistent across three agro-ecology zones. three qtls were detected in two agro-ecological zones: on lg <dig> , lg <dig>  and lg <dig> . even though, five gy qtls were detected in multiple agro-ecology zones, there were no qtls significant in all locations. the traits hd and md as yield component traits are known to be sensitive to altitude because of day length. however, the hd and md qtls did not show discernible differences among different altitudes in this study. assefa et al  <cit>  demonstrated the diversity of yield related traits using  <dig> different germplasm populations collected from northern and central regions in ethiopia corresponding to the same agro-ecology zones in this study. regional differences in various traits of tef germplasm have been reported but altitude gradient regimes had no significant influence in affecting diversity levels in tef germplasm populations. similar results were found in ethiopian wheat, barley and sorghum germplasm  <cit> .

different soil types probably influenced qtl detection in this study. two soil types were used in debre zeit: light soil  and black soil . plants were more vigorous and tall in the loamy andosols, compared to the heavy textured vertisol, even though the rainfall amount and temperature are the same for both soil types . the qtls for pwt, pswt, and ninter were identified only at dzls , but the qtls for 100sw, lodg, panl, and inter <dig> were identified only at dzbs,  <dig>  . since those experiments were conducted at very similar conditions, it is likely that soil type was the major factor interacting with the qtls. teklu and tefera  <cit>  conducted a yield potential experiment in which  <dig> agronomic traits were examined for  <dig> tef varieties on two soil types. the most significant  variety and soil type interactions were found for plant height and panicle length. among four ph qtls in this study, two were detected on lg <dig>  and lg <dig>  each. however, three qtls for panl were identified only in dzbs , not in dzls . the environmentally sensitive qtls for yield and yield components detected in this study clearly illustrate the importance of determining if qtls by environment interactions are due to changes in magnitude or are crossover interactions before using mas to select for qtls. identifying and selecting the proper allele at qtls with crossover interactions requires careful evaluation in target environments. inappropriate allele identification or selection could result in the indirect selection of qtl alleles with detrimental effects in some target environments.

low grain yield of tef is partly due to the low basic productivity of currently available cultivars, together with susceptibility to lodging which has been the most serious agronomic problem. lodging index showed positive and highly significant  correlations with pswt, 100sw, gy, sb and negative correlations with pedl thus, high yielding rils tended to lodge . two of the lodg qtls, on lg <dig>  were associated with ph, gy and yield related traits, and the other three qtls were independent of yield related traits . the positive correlation of lodging with yield and other important yield component traits indicates that improvement of lodging resistance in tef will be a challenging issue for a breeder. of five lodg qtls, all alleles causing more lodging were from the tall, high yielding and more lodging resistant parent, kaye murri compared to e. pilosa   . this results from the unusual patterns of correlations of several traits differentiating the cultivated and wild parents of this cross. the weak or non-significant correlations of lodg with cd <dig>  cd <dig>  pedl, panl, ph, inter <dig>  rpr <dig>  rpr <dig>  crush <dig>  and crush <dig> were counterintuitive. on the other hand, culml ninter, and inter <dig>  were positively correlated while dia was negatively correlated with lodg as would be expected. the lack of significance of the negative correlation coefficients with rpr and crush traits can be attributed to the small number of replicates and environments as well as the difficulty in measuring those traits. however, field observations of the wild and cultivated parent suggest that the very thin culms, small crown diameter, and weak straw of the wild parent, rather than plant height, are the traits contributing most to its lodging susceptibility. several studies have found that qtls for lodging and plant height are linked or located in the same chromosomal regions and could be used as indirect selection parameters for barley  <cit> , rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and italian ryegrass  <cit> . however, a reduction in plant height to improve lodging resistance may reduce the photosynthetic capacity of a canopy. in addition, the susceptibility to lodging differed among cultivars with similar plant height in wheat and rice  <cit> . other factors such as stem cellulose or lignin content are related to stem rigidity  <cit>  but were not measured in this study. one of the lignin biosynthesis genes, pal  co-localized with lodg qtl in lg <dig>  suggesting that it may be a candidate gene for this trait.

the development of inter-specific populations is one strategy to broaden the genetic diversity of cultivated crops and to identify qtls associated with beneficial traits, such as yield, grain quality and disease resistance  <cit> . e. pilosa  alleles had an agronomically beneficial effect on  <dig> out of the  <dig>  qtls detected in the present study, including hd, pwt, pswt, gy, sb, cd <dig>  pedl, panl, ph, inter <dig>  inter, and crush <dig>  this proportion is similar to that reported by septiningsih et al  <cit> , where 33% of the alleles from the wild o. rufipogon presented favorable effects compared to o. sativa alleles. however, it is lower compared to the 53% reported by thomson et al  <cit> , with the same species. there were two qtls identified on lg <dig> and lg <dig> with an increase in yield from the e. pilosa  alleles . the qtl on lg <dig> was not linked to any known undesirable qtls and the e. pilosa  allele would be directly useful for developing breeding materials. however, the gy qtl interval  in lg <dig> was associated with a large increase in plant height, resulting in lodging. the gy qtl in lg <dig> may still be useful if the negative linkage can be broken or counteracted by other qtl reducing plant height. if markers can be successfully used to reduce linkage drag, the positive qtls from e. pilosa  will be potentially useful for improving cultivated tef. therefore, this study suggests that e. pilosa , and possibly other wild accessions, could be useful for diversifying the cultivated tef germplasm pool.

CONCLUSIONS
the primary objective of this study was to determine the number and location of qtls for important agronomic traits in tef. an inter-specific population was used to map  <dig> qtls for  <dig> traits across  <dig> linkage groups. the interactions of genotypes and environments among qtls were reported here to evaluate alleles for target breeding environments. the results of this qtl study are a first step towards the design of a marker-assisted selection program for tef improvement.
