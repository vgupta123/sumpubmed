BACKGROUND
foxp <dig> is a forkhead domain transcription factor whose mutation has been associated with severe deficits in language  <cit> . its cloning and expression during development have been described in humans, mouse, songbird, frog, medaka, and zebrafish  <cit> . cns expression during development in the different vertebrate species is remarkably similar, with conserved expression in the telencephalon, basal ganglia, thalamus, tectum, tegmentum, cerebellum, and hindbrain. however, the function of foxp <dig> during cns development is poorly understood. homozygous knockout or point mutation of foxp <dig> in mice leads to early postnatal death, with reports of disordered purkinje cell layers  <cit>  and smaller cerebellar size  <cit> . in songbirds, foxp <dig> appears to be necessary for vocal learning and is expressed in neurons during active song learning  <cit> .

the neural circuits and genetic cascades in which foxp <dig> participates remain uncharacterized. chromatin immunoprecipitation methods have identified potential downstream targets of foxp <dig>  <cit> , but in vivo function and importance of the identified targets is uncertain. to understand in greater detail the role of foxp <dig> in cns development, we sought to identify how foxp <dig> expression is regulated. the conservation of six predicted lef <dig> binding sites between pufferfish, zebrafish, mouse, and human in the foxp <dig> genomic region , we demonstrated that lef <dig> can bind directly to the functional enhancer sites, and showed that in the absence of lef <dig> these enhancers fail to function. the foxp <dig> enhancers will be useful for dissection of foxp <dig> function by allowing detailed analysis of axon pathfinding and synaptogenesis in foxp2-expressing neurons.

RESULTS
foxp <dig> and lef <dig> have sequential and overlapping expression in the cns during embryogenesis
we noted that  <dig> binding sites for tcf/lef transcription factors are conserved between mouse and pufferfish in the foxp <dig> genomic region, which is more than for any other putative tcf/lef target gene  starting at  <dig> hpf, and in the tectum starting at  <dig> hpf . foxp <dig> expression in the mhb and tectum becomes apparent at  <dig> hpf . other domains of lef <dig> and foxp <dig> expression, including the telencephalon, hypothalamus, and dorsal diencephalon, had non-overlapping expression. to confirm that foxp <dig> and lef <dig> are indeed co-expressed in the same cells, rather than in distinct subsets of cells in the same region, we performed double in situs, and found that foxp <dig> and lef <dig> are co-expressed in tectal cells at  <dig> hpf . this sequentially overlapping pattern of expression in the mhb, and contemporaneous overlap in the tectum, confirmed that lef <dig> was present in a relevant pattern to potentially direct foxp <dig> expression.

knockdown of lef <dig> causes loss of foxp <dig> expression
based on this overlap of expression, we hypothesized that lef <dig> might regulate foxp <dig>  to test this, we used several approaches. first, we used a morpholino to knockdown lef <dig>  <cit> , and evaluated foxp <dig> in situ expression. knockdown of lef <dig> causes a near-complete loss of foxp <dig> expression in the tectum, mhb, and hindbrain at  <dig> hpf  in 85% of injected embryos , compared with 0% of uninjected embryos . this effect is specific to lef <dig>  since a morpholino against a different lef/tcf family member, tcf3b  <cit> , which is also expressed in the tectum and hindbrain  <cit> , showed no effect on foxp <dig> expression . the loss of foxp <dig> expression in the hindbrain, where lef <dig> expression is not detectable by in situ , is presumably an indirect effect, perhaps via loss of an inductive signal from the mhb. alternatively, this could be a direct effect, for example, if lef <dig> is expressed at very low levels in the hindbrain, or if some lef1-positive neurons migrate from the mhb to the hindbrain.

to confirm that loss of foxp <dig> expression was due to knockdown of lef <dig> and not a non-specific morpholino effect, we utilized two alternative means to remove lef <dig> expression. first, we examined expression of foxp <dig> in dfx <dig> mutant embryos. dfx <dig> is a deletion on chromosome  <dig> which contains lef <dig> ; homozygous deficiency mutants do not express lef <dig>  <cit> . we found that homozygous dfx <dig> mutants do not express foxp <dig> in the tectum, mhb, or hindbrain  .

second, we examined whether a dominant negative construct which inhibits lef <dig> function would cause a loss of foxp <dig> expression. we used embryos carrying the transgene hsp70l:Î”tcf-gfp, which expresses an n-terminal deletion of tcf3a fused to gfp. in the absence of its n-terminal dna-binding domain, tcf3a acts as a dominant repressor of wnt-mediated transcription  <cit> . following heat-shock at  <dig> hpf for  <dig> hour, embryos were collected  <dig> hours post-heat shock. there was loss of foxp <dig> expression in the tectum, mhb, and hindbrain  in 61% of transgenic embryos , and in 0% of non-transgenic siblings . decrease of foxp <dig> telencephalic expression is presumably due to a dominant effect of the transgene, since the decrease was not seen using the morpholino or dfx <dig> 

the loss of foxp <dig> expression in the tectum and hindbrain is not secondary to an absence of cells, as expression of the tectal marker mbx  <cit>  is indistinguishable between wild type and lef <dig> morphants . other markers for the tectum , and hindbrain  of lef <dig> morphants also appear as wild type patterns and levels  <cit> ; j.e.l. and r.i.d., unpublished data). furthermore, the loss of foxp <dig> expression persists at  <dig> hpf . these results show that loss of lef <dig> specifically causes loss of foxp <dig> expression in the tectum, mhb, and hindbrain.

identification of foxp <dig> genomic enhancers and lef <dig> binding sites
 <dig> potential conserved binding sites for lef/tcf family transcription factors were identified in the foxp <dig> genomic locus of mouse and pufferfish using in silico analysis  <cit> . this algorithm  aligns transcription factor sequence sites from orthologous genomic regions between two species, with scoring of the sites determined by conservation, affinity, and clustering of sites. based on conserved synteny between zebrafish, mouse, and pufferfish, we initially were able to identify  <dig> of these sites in the zebrafish foxp <dig> genomic locus using sanger centre genome assembly zv <dig> .

because the foxp <dig> genomic assembly is incomplete in the region upstream of the 2nd coding exon , we sought to identify the sixth predicted lef <dig> binding site. in human foxp <dig> this site is  <dig>  kb upstream of the first coding exon. we obtained the sequence for this region in zebrafish from the unassembled bac dkey-116l <dig>  using the enhancer element locator algorithm  <cit> , we compared the  <dig> kb regions immediately upstream of the first coding exon of foxp <dig> from the human and zebrafish genomes. we found conservation of this same element  located  <dig>  kb upstream of the first coding exon in zebrafish .

to identify foxp <dig> enhancers, and to determine whether any of the potential lef <dig> sites might function in vivo in the context of enhancer elements, we cloned genomic fragments containing the sites into a tol <dig> transposon-based vector   <cit> . to visualize expression controlled by the potential enhancers, each dna fragment was cloned immediately upstream of gfp under control of a minimal promoter  <cit> . in total we cloned nine genomic dna fragments , from five different regions, containing the six predicted lef <dig> sites . to test for expression, we injected one cell stage embryos and assayed gfp expression from  <dig> hpf through  <dig> hpf . subsequent analysis used stable transgenic lines, which mostly reproduced the same patterns of expression. three of the regions, foxp2-enhancera, b, and d, drove gfp expression in patterns partially recapitulating foxp <dig> expression . potential enhancers foxp2-fragmentc and foxp2-fragmente had no expression.

foxp2-enhancera drove expression in the eye, diencephalon, tectum, hindbrain, and telencephalon . gfp expression was first noted in the telencephalon at  <dig> hpf, then at  <dig> hpf in the eye, tectum and hindbrain, becoming maximal at  <dig> hpf. by  <dig> hpf expression in the cns diminished significantly, while jaw expression became visible. subcloning of foxp2-enhancera to yield enhancera. <dig> and a. <dig> revealed very similar patterns to foxp2-enhancera . however, enhancera. <dig> had significantly fewer labeled cells, suggesting that the more proximal region of enhancera and enhancera. <dig> contains necessary elements. foxp2-enhancerb expression in the telencephalon began at  <dig> hpf, with eye and hindbrain expression apparent by  <dig> hpf . foxp2-enhancerd expression in the eye, dorsal diencephalon, and tectum began at  <dig> hpf, was maximal at  <dig> hpf, and decreased by  <dig> hpf .

the enhancers we have identified partially mirror endogenous foxp <dig> expression  <cit> . while the enhancer fragments were chosen based on in silico prediction of potential lef <dig> binding sites  <cit> , our analysis shows the importance of in vivo validation, since only  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted binding sites appear to lie in functional enhancer elements for the stages analyzed.

lef <dig> knockdown leads to loss of expression from foxp2-enhancers a. <dig>  b, and d
based on our observations that foxp2-enhancers a. <dig>  b, and d show expression in a pattern mirroring lef <dig> expression in the tectum and hindbrain, and contained putative binding sites for lef <dig>  we tested whether knockdown of lef <dig> led to loss of gfp expression. we injected lef <dig> morpholino into stable transgenic foxp <dig> enhancer lines zc <dig>  tgzc <dig>  tgzc47), and looked for gfp expression in the tectum and hindbrain at  <dig> hpf. to detect enhancer-driven transcription with maximum sensitivity, we used an in situ probe for gfp. morphants showed a loss of gfp expression in the tectum and hindbrain, but maintenance of telencephalic expression, in 89% of enhancera. <dig> embryos , 100% of enhancerb embryos , and 100% of enhancerd embryos  . in contrast, in uninjected embryos only 2%, 0%, and 0% , respectively, showed loss of tectum and hindbrain expression. further, the lef1-mediated loss of expression from the enhancers was visible at  <dig> hpf by visualization of gfp .

to demonstrate that loss of gfp expression in the lef <dig> morphants was not simply due to absence of the gfp-expressing cells, we injected lef <dig> morpholino into transgenic fish lines tgzf <dig>  and tge <dig>  tgzf <dig> expresses gfp in all post-mitotic neurons  <cit> , while tge <dig> expresses gfp in a pattern mirroring pax2a expression, including in the mhb, cerebellum, and hindbrain  <cit> . in both lines we found that lef <dig> morphants still expressed gfp in the tectum, mhb, and hindbrain . in addition, using tgzc <dig> to label retinal axons , we observed that the pattern of retinotectal projections appeared normal in  <dig> hpf morphants . although overall numbers of gfp-expressing cells appeared reduced in lef <dig> morphants of tgzf <dig> and tge <dig>  in the foxp <dig> enhancer lines there was a complete lack of gfp-expressing cells in the tectum and hindbrain. these results show that loss of tectal and hindbrain expression observed with the lef <dig> morpholino in foxp2-enhancera. <dig>  foxp2-enhancerb, and foxp2-enhancerd is not simply due to a loss of neurons, but instead indicates a requirement for lef <dig> in these enhancers' function.

chromatin immunoprecipitation identifies critical lef <dig> binding sites in foxp2-enhancera. <dig> and foxp2-enhancerb
to test whether lef <dig> can bind to foxp2-enhancera. <dig> and foxp2-enhancerb to regulate foxp <dig> expression, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  using a polyclonal antibody against zebrafish lef <dig>  <cit> . we designed pcr amplicons to test different regions of foxp2-enhancera. <dig> and foxp2-enhancerb , using chromatin extracted from  <dig> hpf embryos. for foxp2-enhancera. <dig>  we found that pcr amplicon fp <dig>  showed significant enrichment compared to controls x <dig> embryos) . interestingly, amplicon fp <dig>  encompassing the predicted lef <dig> binding site in foxp2-enhancera. <dig> , showed minimal enrichment . further, a deletion construct of foxp2-enhancera:gfp, removing the region containing fp <dig>  did not cause loss of gfp expression . this suggests that maximal lef <dig> binding for foxp2-enhancera. <dig> is centered around fp <dig>  for foxp2-enhancerb, we found that fpb <dig> had significant enrichment compared to controls . this pcr amplicon contains a predicted lef <dig> binding site  <cit>  . we therefore conclude that lef <dig> directly interacts with regulatory regions of foxp <dig> in  <dig> hpf zebrafish embryos.

discussion
our data show that lef <dig> and foxp <dig> expression overlap in the developing cns, and that lef <dig> is necessary for foxp <dig> expression in the tectum, mhb, and hindbrain. we identified lef1binding sites in the foxp <dig> regulatory regions, based on the identification of foxp <dig> enhancers that depend on lef <dig> for expression, and chip analysis showing binding of lef <dig> to these enhancers.

lef <dig> regulation appears to be a combination of both direct and indirect effects on foxp <dig> . in the tectum and mhb, lef <dig> expression precedes foxp <dig> expression. loss of lef <dig> leads to loss of both endogenous foxp <dig> expression, and expression from foxp <dig> enhancers. in the hindbrain loss of lef <dig> also leads to a loss of foxp <dig> expression. since lef <dig> expression is not detectable in the hindbrain, we hypothesize that loss of foxp <dig> expression occurs both via an inductive effect of lef <dig> expression in the mhb, and through a second gene regulated by lef <dig> . this model would explain why we observe foxp <dig> expression  in the hindbrain , as well as why foxp <dig> expression persists after lef <dig> expression in the mhb stops. in addition, our data demonstrate that foxp <dig> expression in the telencephalon, including the subpallium/basal ganglia, is regulated independently of lef <dig> 

since foxp <dig> expression in the telencephalon is not lef1-dependent, other factors must regulate foxp <dig>  conversely, in regions where lef <dig> is expressed but foxp <dig> is not, for example the dorsal diencephalon, lack of foxp <dig> expression could either reflect an absence of some necessary co-factors, or the presence of an inhibitor of expression, or both mechanisms. we have tried to globally activate foxp <dig> by heat-shock induction of a constitutively active form of tcf <dig> , but did not observe any ectopic foxp <dig> expression , implying stringent, multifactorial control of foxp <dig> expression.

previous computer algorithm-based methods identified several other potential lef <dig> binding sites in the foxp <dig> genomic region  <cit> , but our in vivo analysis failed to support a role for them. another recently described in silico method to identify transcription factor target genes would also fail to identify the lef <dig> enhancers for foxp <dig>  as this method only included the  <dig> kb regions immediately upstream of transcriptional start sites  <cit> . our work shows the importance of actual in vivo testing for analysis of enhancer gene regulation.

since we analyzed expression up to  <dig> hours after fertilization, enhancers responsible for controlling expression at later times might have been missed. given that all of the cns domains of expression for foxp <dig> are present by  <dig> hpf  <cit> , we feel that this is unlikely. however, we can not exclude the possibility that untested genomic regions might regulate expression, or that several independent regions might function in concert.

this study identified three regions functioning as enhancers for foxp <dig>  specifically driving expression in the telencephalon, eye, diencephalon, tectum, and hindbrain. their expression reveals that foxp <dig> is expressed in multiple brain regions, under strict temporal and spatial control, regulated through both lef1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. these transgenic lines label multiple distinct axon tracts , and will allow analysis of subsets of foxp <dig> neurons and axons, in both wild type and mutant backgrounds, as well as misexpression and rescue experiments.

the role of foxp <dig> in cns development has remained elusive, despite multiple genetic studies in humans demonstrating its necessity for normal language development  <cit> . in affected members of the human ke family, who carry a heterozygous point mutation which disrupts the function of one copy of foxp <dig>  voxel-based morphometric mri analyses suggest disturbances in broca's area, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum  <cit> . studies of foxp <dig> knockout or point mutation mice have consistently shown cerebellar involvement. homozygotes have been reported to have disordered purkinje cell layering  <cit>  and smaller cerebellar size  <cit> , while heterozygotes are noted to display impaired motor learning and altered purkinje cell synaptic plasticity  <cit> . our identification of lef <dig> as a regulator of foxp <dig> expression in the mhb and hindbrain is a first step towards understanding the foxp <dig> genetic network involved in cerebellar development. the role of the cerebellum in language function is at least partially understood  <cit> , but it is uncertain whether the oromotor apraxia of the ke family is due to defects of cerebellar or striatal pathways   <cit> . importantly, other domains of foxp <dig> expression, for example in the telencephalon , appear to be regulated independently of lef <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
wnt signaling has multiple roles in neuronal specification and the development of connectivity in the cns  <cit> , as does lef <dig>  which is activated by the canonical wnt signaling cascade. lef <dig> is necessary for development of dentate gyrus neurons  <cit> , for neurogenesis and specification of neuronal subsets in the hypothalamus  <cit> , and for expression of the transcription factors zic2a and zic <dig> in the tectum  <cit> . here we show that lef <dig> regulates foxp <dig> expression in the tectum, mhb, and hindbrain. interestingly, chip studies suggest that foxp <dig> may in turn regulate components of the wnt signaling pathway  <cit> . the identification of components of the foxp <dig> signaling cascade, including upstream, interacting, and downstream members, will be important for understanding foxp <dig> function, and for elucidating the genes and neural circuits involved in language development.
