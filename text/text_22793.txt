BACKGROUND
plants have evolved a complex transcriptional machinery for generating and using small rnas that guide dna cytosine methylation at homologous regions of the genome. key components of the rna-directed dna methylation pathway include two functionally diversified rna polymerase ii -related rna polymerases called pol iv and pol v  <cit> . pol iv is needed to produce the small rna trigger for methylation whereas pol v acts downstream of small rna biogenesis to facilitate de novo methylation of genomic dna at the small rna-targeted site. additional factors, including chromatin remodelers, putative transcription factors, and several novel, plant-specific proteins whose functions are not well understood, are required for pol v function  <cit> . in a current model, pol v synthesizes scaffold transcripts that interact with argonaute4-bound small rnas, which recruits the methylation machinery to the target dna  <cit> .

rna-directed dna methylation results in a characteristic modification pattern that is typified by methylation of cytosines in all sequence contexts  within the region of small rna-dna sequence homology  <cit> . in particular, asymmetric chh methylation is a hallmark of rna-directed dna methylation. domains rearranged methyltranferase <dig>  is the major enzyme catalyzing de novo methylation of cytosines in all sequence contexts in response to small rna signals  <cit> . the maintenance activities of methyltransferase <dig>  and chromomethylase <dig> act primarily to perpetuate pre-existing cg and chg methylation, respectively, during successive rounds of dna replication  <cit> .

transposons, pseudogenes and non-protein coding repeats are frequent targets of rna-directed dna methylation  <cit> . by contrast, protein coding genes are generally free of rna-directed dna methylation unless intimately associated with repeats or transposon-related sequences  <cit> . however, up to 30 % of expressed genes in arabidopsis thaliana have in their gene bodies exclusively cg methylation that relies on met <dig> and is independent of the rna-directed dna methylation pathway  <cit> . thus, transposons and genes can be distinguished by discrete methylation patterns that are imposed by different methylation machineries. the origins of these distinct methylation patterns and their functional significance are not yet fully understood  <cit> . the biological role of cg methylation in gene bodies, which does not inhibit transcriptional elongation by pol ii, is unknown but it may prevent spurious transcription from internal promoters  <cit>  or help to define exons  <cit> . an alternative proposal is that gene body methylation restrains genes from being responsive to internal or external cues, e.g. developmental or environmental signals  <cit> .

curiously, even though transposons are frequent targets of rna-directed dna methylation, only a small subset of transposons is selectively reactivated in mutants defective in this epigenetic pathway  <cit> . by contrast, a number of transposons are mobilized in mutants defective in met <dig> or the chromatin remodeler decrease in dna methylation <dig>  <cit> . therefore, even though rna-directed dna methylation contributes to repression of transposons it is not the sole epigenetic modification involved in the silencing of these elements  <cit> .

in a search for targets of rna-directed dna methylation in arabidopsis, we identified several members of a gene family encoding small cysteine-rich peptides . these crp genes are atypically methylated like transposons, containing cg, chg and chh methylation in their gene bodies. this gene body methylation, which is due in part to rna-directed dna methylation, is associated with gene silencing in leaves and is reduced in synergid cells of the female gametophyte where the crp genes are specifically expressed. here we report these results and discuss the possible origin and evolutionary significance of this unusual pattern of dna methylation.

RESULTS
atypical methylation pattern of crp genes embedded in sat <dig> repeats
to identify targets of rna-directed dna methylation in the arabidopsis genome, we used methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism   <cit> . cutting genomic dna with appropriate restriction enzymes that are methylation-sensitive  and methylation-insensitive  allowed us to identify genomic regions that are differentially methylated at asymmetric chh sites in wild-type plants compared to an nrpe <dig> mutant, which is impaired in the largest subunit of pol v  <cit> . two fragments identified in this analysis  were found in a blast search to match unannotated intergenic regions of the arabidopsis genome. a further sequence search against repbase http://www.girinst.org revealed similarity of these fragments to the atsat <dig> repeat , which is defined by a 2196-bp long consensus sequence  <cit> . sat <dig> is annotated as a satellite sequence that has recently expanded near the centromere of chromosome  <dig> with several distantly related single copies dispersed on other chromosomes  <cit> . a subsequent blast search using the 2196-bp sat <dig> repeat monomer as a query sequence identified four partial or complete single, dispersed copies of sat <dig> in the arabidopsis genome .

four single dispersed copies of the sat <dig> repeat are detected in a blast search using the  <dig> bp sat <dig> consensus sequence  <cit>  as a query sequence. one nearly full-length copy is in a transposon-rich region close to the centromere of chromosome  <dig>  two truncated copies, which correspond to those detected in the msap analysis, are present in relatively gene-rich regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. a third truncated copy is present in a region containing both genes and transposons on chromosome  <dig>  the agi numbers of the embedded crp genes or pseudogenes are shown.

although sat <dig> was originally thought to be a non-protein coding repeat, improvements in the annotation of the arabidopsis genome sequence during the course of our study revealed that genes encoding small cysteine-rich peptides  and related crp pseudogenes are embedded in the sat <dig> repeat monomer . the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> crp genes and pseudogenes that have been placed into different homology subgroups  <cit> . the particular subgroup associated with the sat <dig> repeat has been termed crp <dig>  which has  <dig> members in arabidopsis <cit> . the crp <dig> subgroup has also been referred to as the duf <dig> family  <cit>  and eca <dig> gametogenesis-related proteins  <cit> http://www.arabidopsis.org. in addition to  <dig> copies embedded in the block of sat <dig> repeat monomers close to the centromere on chromosome  <dig>  there are an additional  <dig> single copies of the crp <dig> family - not all of which are embedded in a sat <dig> repeat monomer-distributed on four out of the five arabidopsis chromosomes . eighteen of these are predicted to encode proteins, including a gene we have termed crp <dig> , which is embedded in a truncated, intergenic copy of sat <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . the remaining seven crp <dig> family members are likely pseudogenes, including two embedded in truncated sat <dig> copies on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, which were identified in the msap analysis  .

methylation of crp coding regions: pol iv/pol v-dependent chh methylation
to study methylation of the sat <dig> repeat, we performed a bisulfite sequence analysis on the truncated sat <dig> monomer containing the crp <dig> gene . this sequence contains 369 bp crp <dig> coding region as well as 430 bp upstream and 213 bp downstream sequences . given its repetitive nature, we expected to detect heavy methylation throughout the sat <dig> sequence. we were surprised, therefore, to find non-uniform methylation that appeared to be concentrated within the crp <dig> coding region . one reason for this non-uniform distribution of methylation is that the number of cytosines available for methylation in cg and chg sequence contexts differed along the length of the sat <dig> repeat. the numbers were relatively low in the regions upstream  and downstream  but considerably higher in the crp <dig> coding region  . because at least some methylation was detected at all of the cgs and chgs throughout the sat <dig> repeat monomer , the density of cg and chg methylation was naturally higher within the crp <dig> coding region compared to the flanking regions.

the total number of cytosines and those that are methylated or unmethylated in each sequence context  are shown for each region of the sat <dig> repeat monomer containing the crp <dig> gene . the percentage of methylated or unmethylated cytosines is shown in parentheses except where the value is 0 %. percentages for methylated cytosines in a chh context  are shown in red. the difference for the upstream region vs. crp <dig> cds is significant . for the downstream region, the difference is not significant  but this may reflect the lower number of cytosines in the downstream region.

the second factor influencing the sat <dig> methylation pattern was the tendency for chh trinucleotides to be more frequently and more highly methylated within the crp <dig> coding region than in flanking sequences. although the number of chh nucleotide groups was approximately the same in the upstream region and crp <dig> coding region , methylation was only detected at around  <dig> chhs  in the upstream region, which differed significantly from the  <dig> chhs  with at least some methylation in the crp <dig> coding region . in the downstream region, methylation was detected at  <dig> out of  <dig> chhs  . in addition, the overall level of chh methylation in the crp <dig> coding region was 12 % compared to ~ 3 % and ~ 6 % in the upstream and downstream regions, respectively . because chh methylation is a hallmark of rna-directed dna methylation, these findings suggest that the crp <dig> coding region is targeted by this epigenetic pathway. supporting this idea, the overall level of chh methylation in the crp <dig> coding region was reduced ~ 65-80 % in various mutants defective in rna-directed dna methylation . a similar pattern of dense cg, chg and chh methylation within the crp <dig> coding region together with considerably less methylation in the flanking regions was observed in the whole genome bisulfite sequencing  analysis by lister and coworkers  <cit> , http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome/epigenome.html.

the crp <dig> gene is not exceptional in its methylation pattern. several other predicted protein-coding genes in the crp <dig> family, such as at3g <dig>  and at5g <dig>  and at5g <dig> , which are not embedded in sat <dig> repeats , also contain in their coding regions dense cg, chg and chh methylation http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome/epigenome.html. this methylation is due in part to rna-directed dna methylation as evidenced by the loss of non-cg methylation in a drm <dig> drm <dig> cmt <dig>  triple mutant http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome/epigenome.html, which isdefective in the de novo methyltransferase drm <dig> that is required for rna-directed dna methylation  <cit> .

unique pol iv-dependent 24-nt small rnas originating from crp coding regions
our bisulfite sequencing analysis and the independent methylome analysis of lister and coworkers  <cit> http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome/epigenome.html suggested that methylation of the coding regions of crp4crp5a and crp5b genes is due in part to rna-directed dna methylation. we therefore tested whether the requisite pol iv-dependent 24-nt small rnas needed to induce rna-directed dna methylation originate from these sequences. a northern blot analysis using a sat <dig> probe readily detected 24-nt small rnas that disappeared in pol iv pathway mutants  . because the sat <dig> probe detected bulk small rnas originating from this repeat, we used deep sequencing to investigate in more detail small rnas arising from individual crp genes. this analysis indeed revealed unique 24-nt small rnas associated with the coding regions of the crp4crp5a and crp5b genes and these small rnas were reduced in pol iv pathway mutants  .

expression of crp genes in the female gametophyte
a previous genome-wide expression profiling analysis demonstrated that many crp genes in the crp <dig> subgroup, including crp5a and crp5b, are expressed in the egg apparatus  of the female gametophyte  <cit> . however, the expression patterns of the four crp <dig> subgroup members embedded in single copy sat <dig> repeat monomers   has not yet been reported. using semi-quantitative rt-pcr, we detected transcripts from these two genes and two pseudogenes in flowers but not leaves, and with the exception of the pseudogene at2g <dig>  transcription is not strongly reactivated in mutants defective in rna-directed dna methylation .

to obtain a more detailed view of the cell type-specific expression pattern, we generated constructs encoding a gus reporter protein and a crp4-gfp fusion protein, both under the control of a crp <dig> promoter fragment, which comprises 921 bp upstream of the atg start codon of the crp <dig> gene. after introducing these constructs into wild-type arabidopsis plants, gus and crp4-gfp gene expression was observed specifically in the synergid cell region of the female gametophyte, indicating that the crp <dig> promoter is active exclusively in these cells . we therefore infer that the detection of crp <dig> transcripts in flowers of non-transgenic plants  reflects expression of the endogenous crp <dig> gene in synergid cells.

crp <dig> coding sequence is not methylated when transcribed by pol ii to produce a translatable mrna
to study methylation of the crp <dig> coding region in cells where the crp <dig> promoter is active, we isolated dna from synergid cells of a transgenic plant expressing a crp4-gfp fusion gene under the control of the crp <dig> promoter. a pcr-based approach was used to examine methylation in the crp <dig> coding sequence of this fusion gene as well as the endogenous crp <dig> gene. for this, dna was digested with either hpaii  or ddei , and pcr amplification was performed using primers specific for the crp <dig> coding sequence in either the endogenous crp <dig> gene or the crp4-gfp fusion gene. in both cases, little or no amplification product was observed when using synergid cell dna, indicating reduced methylation of the endogenous and transgenic crp <dig> coding sequences in cells where the crp <dig> promoter is active . by contrast, a strong amplification product indicating the presence of dna methylation was seen for both the endogenous and transgenic crp <dig> sequences when using leaf dna . the latter results are consistent with the bisulfite sequence analysis on leaf dna, which revealed dense methylation in the crp <dig> coding region of both the endogenous crp <dig> gene  and the crp <dig> promoter-driven crp4-gfp fusion .

we obtained further evidence that the crp <dig> coding sequence is unmethylated when transcribed by pol ii by examining methylation of a crp4-gfp fusion gene under the control of the constitutive 35 s promoter in leaves. in transgenic plants containing this construct, the crp <dig> coding sequence of the crp4-gfp fusion gene remained largely unmethylated . moreover, a crp4-gfp fusion protein was detectable on western blots in these plants, indicating pol ii transcription of a translatable crp4-gfp mrna from the 35 s promoter . by contrast, the crp <dig> coding sequence of a crp4-gfp fusion gene under the control of the crp <dig> promoter acquired methylation similar to the endogenous crp <dig> gene  and no crp4-gfp fusion protein was detected in plants containing this construct . thus, crp <dig> coding sequences transcribed by pol ii lack methylation in both synergid cells, where the endogenous crp <dig> gene and crp4-gfp fusion gene are expressed from the crp <dig> promoter, and in leaves, where the fusion gene is under the control of the constitutive 35s promoter.

the crp <dig> gene is not inducible by flg <dig> or heat treatment in seedlings
the endogenous crp <dig> gene was not de-repressed in the leaves of mutants defective in rna-directed dna methylation  but it is possible that biotic or abiotic stresses might reactivate the crp <dig> gene. given the suggested roles of crps in microbial defense  <cit> , we tested whether the crp <dig> gene was induced after treatment of seedlings with the bacterial flagellin peptide flg <dig>  which is a potent elicitor of the innate immune response in plants  <cit> . although we observed induction of mpk <dig> , a known flagellin-induced gene  <cit> , no induction of the crp <dig> gene was observed under the same conditions . similarly, we did not observe induction of the crp <dig> gene after heat stress that was sufficient to activate the onsen retrotransposon , which requires pol iv pathway components to restrict trans-generational transposition  <cit> .

discussion
current views of dna methylation patterns in plants hold that gene body methylation occurs primarily in a cg context and that non-cg methylation is limited to transposons and non-protein-coding repeats  <cit> . contrary to this view, we have identified several genes encoding crps in arabidopsis that atypically contain in their gene bodies not only cg but also chg and chh methylation, which arises in part from rna-directed dna methylation. these genes are thus methylated like transposons in their coding regions. evidence for this claim includes the detection of pol iv-dependent 24-nt small rnas that are unique to each gene and the reliance of full chh methylation on components of the pol v pathway. in addition to rna-directed dna methylation, other methylation pathways contribute to the dense methylation of crp gene bodies in leaves. this is indicated by the persistence of nearly wild-type levels of cg and chg methylation in mutants defective in rna-directed dna methylation, which lose predominantly chh methylation. multiple layers of epigenetic modifications have been observed previously for other targets of rna-directed dna methylation in plants  <cit> . the biological role of the transposon-like methylation pattern of crp gene bodies is not yet clear but it is likely to be related to gene silencing in the sporophyte. as discussed below, alternative functions can also be considered.

the crp genes investigated in this study are silent and methylated in leaves and, given the restricted expression pattern of the crp <dig> promoter when fused to gus and gfp reporter genes, presumably in other sporophytic tissues as well. as shown here and elsewhere  <cit> , the promoters of many crp genes in the crp <dig> family are active specifically in the egg apparatus region of the female gametophyte . the functions of crps in the female gametophyte are not yet clear but possibilities include acting as pollen tube attractants  <cit> , antimicrobial substances in the vulnerable egg cell region  <cit> , or intercellular signaling molecules during female gametophyte development  <cit> . in our experiments, the synergid cell-specific expression of the crp4-gfp fusion gene, and presumably the crp <dig> endogenous gene, was correlated with a loss of cg and chh methylation in the crp <dig> gene body at the restriction sites tested. this finding suggests a connection between the observed gene body methylation and crp <dig> gene silencing in leaves. we assume a similar association holds true for the crp5a and crp5b genes, which are highly methylated in their gene bodies in leaf tissue http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome/epigenome.html yet expressed exclusively in the egg apparatus region of the female gametophyte  <cit> .

the influence of gene body methylation on expression depends on the sequence context of methylated cytosines. in wild-type plants, cg methylation alone in gene bodies does not inhibit transcriptional elongation and is found at many moderately expressed genes  <cit> . chg methylation in gene bodies, which is induced in the ibm <dig>  mutant, has variable effects on transcription, with only some target genes showing decreased transcription while others are unchanged or even more highly expressed  <cit> . by contrast, our results suggest that a combination of dense cg and non-cg methylation in gene bodies is associated with gene silencing. whether this methylation inhibits transcriptional elongation by pol ii or is the default state when transcription is impaired by other means is not yet known. also unclear is how methylation in crp <dig> gene bodies is lost in synergid cells. it may result from active demethylation by dna glycosylase activities, as observed for imprinted genes in the central cell of the female gametophyte  <cit> , or a lack of silencing factors in synergid cells or their precursors. a recent global enrichment study demonstrated that genes encoding components of the rna-directed dna methylation machinery, in particular six paz-domain proteins, are predominantly expressed in egg cells but some are also expressed in synergid cells  <cit> . loss of crp <dig> gene body methylation in synergid cells may also reflect the restricted cellular distribution of essential transcription factors, such as the synergid cell-specific transcription factor myb <dig>  <cit> . however, there does not seem to be a correlation between methylation of crp genes in leaves and a requirement for myb <dig> in synergid cell-specific expression. for example, both crp5a and crp5b are methylated in leaves and expressed in synergid cells but only the former requires myb <dig>  <cit> .

although gene silencing seems the most likely function and/or consequence of combined cg and non-cg methylation in the crp gene bodies, a possible positive role can also be considered, namely that gene body methylation attunes genes to internal or external cues. this suggestion follows from recent data demonstrating that gene body methylation, whether in a cg or non-cg context, can be dynamic and may render genes sensitive to developmental or environmental signals. for example, a bioinformatics study examining genome-wide gene expression in arabidopsis under many different experimental conditions concluded that cg methylation in gene bodies protects genes from reacting to internal or external stimuli  <cit> . in tomato, a drought-responsive gene that atypically has non-cg methylation in the gene body loses non-cg methylation and gains cg methylation under drought conditions  <cit> . some transcribed genes in human embryonic stem cells contain in their gene bodies non-cg methylation that is lost as cells differentiate and re-established during de-differentiation, suggesting a relationship between non-cg methylation in gene bodies and the differentiation state of the cells  <cit> . in view of these findings, it is conceivable that combined cg and non-cg methylation in crp gene bodies allows responsiveness to either developmental cues in the female gametophyte or external factors in the environment. regarding the latter possibility, we did not observe de-repression of the methylated crp <dig> gene in leaf tissue following treatment with flg <dig> or heat stress, but other biotic or abiotic stresses can be tested in the future.

why are the gene bodies of some crp <dig> gene family members methylated like transposons? although several methylated crp genes are embedded in sat <dig> repeats this is not the case for all , demonstrating that the presence of the flanking sat <dig> sequences is not a requirement for methylation. to explain the dense methylation concentrated in the crp coding regions, we propose that some members of the crp <dig> gene family arose through reverse transcription of mature mrnas  and hence can be classified as retroposed genes . under this hypothesis, an intron-containing progenitor copy would have been highly expressed in the egg cell or one of its precursors in the germline, the spliced mrna reverse transcribed, and the cdna subsequently integrated into egg cell dna to become a heritable part of the genome. through this copying and integration process, crp retrogenes would resemble transposons and be methylated accordingly in their coding regions. consistent with this hypothesis, only one gene in the crp <dig> family has two introns  while the rest are intron-free and thus candidate retrogenes . the observation that at least some crp <dig> gene family members are probably expressed in the egg cell as well as the neighboring synergid cells  <cit>  is compatible with the retrogene hypothesis. interestingly, retrogenes in mammals are expressed mainly in the testes, where transcription is less tightly regulated than in somatic tissues  <cit> . whether controls on transcription are similarly relaxed in synergid cells and/or egg cells in plants remains to be determined.

not all copies of the crp <dig> gene family have a transposon-like methylation pattern in their gene bodies. some lack methylation entirely and one has cg methylation only . although the source of such differences is presently unknown, one possibility is that recently integrated copies still have the initial transposon-like methylation pattern, which over time degenerates into exclusively cg methylation, ultimately resulting in the complete decay of gene body methylation. because methylated cytosine spontaneously deaminates to produce thymine, methylated crp coding regions may experience accelerated sequence diversification over evolutionary time, thus promoting functional diversification of crp proteins. given known or proposed roles of crps in pollen tube guidance  <cit>  and self-incompatibility  <cit> , such sequence changes and functional diversification may help to drive speciation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified several genes of the arabidopsis crp <dig> subgroup that have an unusual transposon-like methylation pattern consisting of cg, chg and chh methylation in their gene bodies. this methylation, which was observed in leaves, appears to be associated with gene silencing in sporophytic tissues because it decreases in synergid cells of the female gametophyte, where the crp genes are specifically expressed. analysis of crp <dig> gene family members suggests that at least some methylated copies may have arisen through retroposition, causing them to be epigenetically modified like transposons through rna-directed dna methylation and other methylation pathways that target mobile elements. the crp genes will be useful models for studying developmentally-regulated changes of combined cg and non-cg methylation in gene bodies and the expansion through retrotransposition of gene families expressed in the plant germline.
