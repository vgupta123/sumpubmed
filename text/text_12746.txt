BACKGROUND
dental caries represents one of the most common infectious diseases afflicting humans  <cit> . of the mutans group of streptococci, streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus , which are gram-positive oral commensal species, are strongly implicated as etiological agents associated with human dental caries. previous investigations have reported that s. sobrinus has a higher acidogenic capacity compared with s. mutans, and the prevalence of s. sobrinus is more closely associated with high caries activity than is that of s. mutans <cit> . these studies suggest the importance of the diagnoses of infection by these organisms. previously, several studies have reported methods for diagnosis of these organisms  <cit> . however, dna-based detection and quantification of specific bacteria cannot distinguish between live and dead bacteria. bacterial dna is degraded after the loss of cell viability; thus, the remaining dna of already dead bacteria can still act as a template dna for pcr. consequently, dna-based detection systems overestimate the cell population. however, we have not differentiated live and dead bacteria within the context of diagnosis of oral infectious diseases, including dental caries. in the present study, we successfully developed and evaluated a discriminative method between live and dead bacteria for the human cariogenic pathogens s. mutans and s. sobrinus using propidium monoazide . previously, ethidium monoazide  was used for discriminating live from dead bacterial cells  <cit> . ema is a dna/rna intercalating substance that only enters bacterial cells with compromised cell walls and cell membranes. however, ema was reported to possibly to penetrate viable cells of some bacterial species, resulting in underestimation of viable bacterial numbers  <cit> . because pma is less able to penetrate viable cells, more attention has been paid to pma as an alternative to ema  <cit> . in the present study, we examined the population of live and dead bacteria in oral specimens. the relationships of cell viability with saliva and dental plaque or carious dentin were further analyzed. finally, we analyzed the cell viability of s. mutans assessed by this pma technique after treatment with hydrogen peroxide  and proposed the usefulness of this technique for biofilm experiments. this is the first report to apply the combination of pma plus real-time pcr  for analysis of the prevalence of live/dead s. mutans cells in oral specimens and to reveal the relationship between cell numbers in saliva and cell numbers in dental plaque and/or carious dentin. additionally, we applied pma-qpcr for monitoring viable s. mutans cell numbers in vitro in planktonic cells and biofilm treated with various concentrations of h2o <dig> for possible application in biofilm experiments.

RESULTS
specificities and sensitivities of the qpcr assay
fifty-two bacterial strains, including s. mutans and s. sobrinus strains, were tested using primers designed from genome regions specific for the bacterial strains. each specific primer pair had broad specificity for the s. mutans or s. sobrinus strains . standard curves for linear regression between the threshold cycle  values and corresponding colony-forming units  were obtained by 10-fold serial dilutions of s. mutans and s. sobrinus cultures. the regression equations for the standard curves for s. mutans and s. sobrinus were y = − <dig> x +  <dig>   and y = − <dig> x +  <dig>  , where y = ct, x = log10x, and x = cfu, respectively . the dynamic ranges were equivalent to  <dig> to  <dig> cfu for both s. mutans  and s. sobrinus  per reaction mixture.

effects of pma and ema on cell viability
we analyzed the effects of various concentrations of pma on cell viability. the effects of  <dig>  and  <dig> μm pma on the viability of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu of s. mutans and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu of s. sobrinus were almost the same as that of  <dig> μm pma. after pma treatment, the bacterial cells were counted. the mean  values for s. mutans and s. sobrinus were  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu, respectively, at  <dig>  μm pma;  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu, respectively, at  <dig> μm pma; and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu, respectively, at  <dig> μm pma. neither  <dig>  or  <dig> μm pma treatment had a significant effect on cell viability of either s. mutans or s. sobrinus , whereas  <dig>  μm ema reduced cell viability of s. mutans and s. sobrinus by nearly  <dig>  log . in addition, pcr was not completely inhibited by treatment of dead cells with  <dig>  μm pma . therefore, we used  <dig> μm pma in this study.

effect of pma on defined ratios of viable and heat-killed bacterial suspensions
to examine the effectiveness of pma treatment at selectively detecting viable cells in the presence of dead cells, various mixtures comprising viable and heat-killed cells were evaluated by qpcr. an aliquot each of s. mutans and s. sobrinus cells was heated at 121°c for  <dig> min in an autoclave. the heat-killed cells were mixed with untreated original culture cells in defined ratios, with viable cells representing  <dig> %,  <dig> %, 1%, or 10% of the total bacteria. in both strains, the signals from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg of chromosomal dna were identical in live cells with and without  <dig> μm pma-treated heat-killed cells .

spiking s. sobrinus cells with oral specimens
to examine whether pcr was inhibited in the presence of oral specimens, chromosomal dna from s. sobrinus-free saliva and plaque specimens was added to s. sobrinus cells. the qpcr analysis of s. sobrinus was not inhibited by chromosomal dna from saliva  or plaque .

correlation of viable s. mutans cell number assessed by pma-qpcr and by culture
we compared the s. mutans cell number in dental plaque from caries-free patients  with that from patients with carious dentin  by qpcr with and without pma and culture. positive correlations were observed between the cell number detected by pma-qpcr and that determined by culture for both caries-free dental plaque  and carious dentin . the positive correlations between qpcr and culture are shown in figure 4b  and 4d . the slopes of the regression equations were lower for qpcr than for pma-qpcr, indicating that the cell number determined by qpcr was higher than that determined by pma-qpcr.

quantitative discrimination of live/dead cariogenic bacterial cells in oral specimens
the numbers of s. mutans and s. sobrinus cells in carious dentin and saliva were quantified in patients with dental caries. as shown in figure 5a, the mean totals of s. mutans cells  calculated by qpcr without pma were  <dig>  ×  <dig>  per  <dig> mg dental plaque  from caries-free donors  and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  per  <dig> mg carious dentin  ; viable cell numbers calculated by qpcr with pma were  <dig>  ×  <dig>  per  <dig> mg carious dentin  and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  per  <dig> mg dental plaque , representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total cells, respectively . there was no significant difference in viable cell number or total cell number between caries dentin and plaque .

next, we compared the number of cells in saliva from patients with and without dental caries. the mean totals of s. mutans cells  calculated by qpcr were  <dig>  ×  <dig>  per  <dig> ml of saliva from patients with dental caries  and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  per  <dig> ml of saliva from caries-free donors ; viable cell numbers calculated by qpcr with pma were  <dig>  ×  <dig>  per  <dig> ml of saliva from patients with dental caries  and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  per  <dig> ml of saliva from caries-free donors , representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total cells, respectively . total cell number and viable cell number differed significantly between caries-positive and -negative saliva .

streptococcus sobrinus was detected in only one patient with dental caries . the total numbers of s. sobrinus cells calculated by qpcr without pma were  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu per  <dig> ml of saliva  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu per  <dig> mg carious dentin .

correlation of viable s. mutans cell number among oral specimens
the correlations of viable cell number between saliva and caries-free plaque and/or carious dentin were examined. among caries-free patients, the number of viable s. mutans cells in saliva was significantly correlated with the number in plaque . no correlation was observed between saliva and carious dentin .

application of pma-qpcr for monitoring live bacteria in biofilm and the planktonic phase
one purpose for the development of this assay was to monitor the viable cell number in biofilm. to evaluate the s. mutans cell number in both planktonic and biofilm forms, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of h2o <dig>  in the planktonic phase, the number of viable s. mutans cells in  <dig> % h2o <dig> was only  <dig> % of the number in h2o2-untreated cells, whereas the number in  <dig> % h2o <dig> was  <dig> % of that in h2o2-untreated cells . there was a significant difference in the viable/total cell ratio between 0% and  <dig> % h2o <dig>  and between 0% and  <dig> % h2o <dig> . in biofilm, the number of viable s. mutans cells in  <dig> % h2o <dig> was  <dig> % of the number in h2o2-untreated cells, whereas that in  <dig> % h2o <dig> was  <dig> % of that in h2o2-untreated cells . there was no significant difference in the viable/total cell ratio between 0% and  <dig> % h2o <dig> or between 0% and  <dig> % h2o <dig> 

discussion
streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus are considered to be cariogenic pathogens in humans  <cit> . various studies have monitored the prevalence of caries-related organisms in oral specimens  <cit> . however, attempts to differentiate between viable and dead bacteria in oral specimens in relation to dental caries have not been reported. in the present study, we initially developed a quantification method for discriminating live and dead cariogenic bacteria, specifically for s. mutans and s. sobrinus. previous investigations have reported that ema has a strong inhibitory effect on the amplification of genomic dna from viable cells  <cit> , and our study confirmed that ema itself decreases cell viability. therefore, all experiments were conducted with pma, which penetrates a damaged cell membrane and intercalates into dna, resulting in the inhibition of pcr, in combination with qpcr to quantitatively differentiate between viable and dead cells. we further performed a spiking experiment to evaluate whether this assay was applicable to oral specimens. in general, obtaining oral specimens that do not contain s. mutans is challenging, whereas obtaining s. sobrinus-free oral samples is relatively easy. for this reason, we performed pma-qpcr amplification specific for s. sobrinus using s. sobrinus-free saliva and s. sobrinus-free dental plaque as an alternative in the spiking experiment. as shown in figure  <dig>  neither saliva nor dental plaque inhibited the pcr, indicating that this assay is applicable for measuring cariogenic bacteria in oral specimens.

we next examined the correlation between the numbers of viable s. mutans cells in oral specimens as detected by pma-qpcr and by culture. we found a positive correlation between these quantification methods for both carious dentin and dental plaque. compared with culture, the number of viable s. mutans cells was overestimated by pma-qpcr. it may be that the culture method usually underestimates the cell number. the cell number determined by conventional qpcr correlated with the cell number determined by culture. several previous investigations have reported that the cell number determined by qpcr correlated with cfu  <cit> . however, compared with pma-qpcr, conventional qpcr overestimated the cell number to a greater extent in both types of clinical specimens. therefore, the cell culture count was closer to the number determined by pma-qpcr than to that determined by conventional qpcr in the present study.

monitoring viable bacterial cells in oral specimens provides information to help understand oral infectious diseases. when we compared the total and viable cell numbers in carious dentin from patients with dental caries and dental plaque from caries-free children, there was no significant difference between carious dentin and dental plaque in terms of either total number s. mutans cells or number of viable cells. we may not be able to simply compare the cell numbers in these specimens because the contents are not identical. nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the percentage of viable cells between the specimens. however, there was a significant difference in total cell number and viable cell number between saliva from patients with dental caries and saliva from caries-free children. monitoring of the viable cell number in relation to the total cell number in oral specimens has not previously been performed. to understand the variation in the viable cell number, both the viable and total cell numbers must be determined. to further understand cell viability in relation to dental caries, a greater number of specimens should be analyzed.

when the relationship between the number of viable s. mutans cells in saliva and in dental plaque from caries-free children was analyzed using pma-qpcr, a positive correlation was found between viable s. mutans cells in saliva and in dental plaque. this result was consistent with previous reports  <cit> . there was no significant correlation between the number of viable s. mutans cells in saliva and that in carious dentin from caries patients in the present study. our data suggest that saliva reflects the number of viable cells in caries-free plaque, but not in carious dentin. previous studies have found that the microbial biota in the dental plaque of children with severe early-childhood caries was significantly less diverse and less complex than that in caries-free children  <cit> . therefore, the viability of cariogenic bacteria in saliva may differ between caries-active and caries-free patients. this possibility should be explored in future studies.

finally, we evaluated the number of viable of s. mutans cells in the planktonic phase and in biofilm. in the planktonic phase, the ratio of viable cells to total bacteria decreased with an increase in h2o <dig> concentration . there was a significant difference in the viable/total bacterial ratio between 0% and  <dig>  and between 0% and  <dig> % h2o <dig>  however, the decreases in the viable/total cell ratio in biofilm at these concentrations were smaller , and there was no significant difference between 0% and  <dig>  or  <dig> % h2o <dig>  these results suggest that pma-qpcr is applicable for monitoring the numbers of viable and dead cells in biofilm. in biofilm experiments, a live/dead stain is sometimes used to distinguish visually between live and dead bacteria  <cit> . although pma-qpcr is advantageous for quantifying viable cells, it does not provide the visualization obtained with live/dead staining. pma-qpcr may be a powerful tool for monitoring the number of viable cells in oral biofilms.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a discriminative quantification method for viable and dead s. mutans and s. sobrinus cells. we evaluated the potential of this assay and applied it to analyze the prevalence of live/dead cariogenic bacteria in oral specimens and to monitor live/dead cells in biofilm experiments. the ability to discrimination between live and dead bacterial cells in biofilm is essential for studying biofilm, and this assay will be helpful for oral biofilm research. our assay will contribute to elucidating the role of viable bacteria in oral biofilm and saliva in relation to disease activities.
