BACKGROUND
neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, is an important human pathogen, being a leading cause of septicaemia and bacterial meningitis. systemic disease has a high case fatality rate and can progress rapidly over the course of a few hours  <cit> . different epidemiological patterns of meningococcal disease are observed across the world and multi-locus sequence typing  has been instrumental in characterising strains and identifying major pathogenic lineages  responsible for disease  <cit> . many n. meningitidis isolates from invasive disease belong to ‘hyperinvasive lineages’  <cit> , such as clonal complexes -  <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig> and cc41/ <dig>  whole genome sequence  analyses have recently been carried out on large isolate collections, including those used to develop mlst  <cit> . these wgs data represent a valuable resource for investigating the frequency and variability of genes encoding meningococcal virulence traits.

type four pili  are important virulence factors for n. meningitidis, contributing to colonisation and disease  <cit> . adhesion of meningococci to epithelial and endothelial cells is mediated by tfp interacting with host cells, promoting bacterial aggregation and mediating microcolony formation  <cit> . neisseria tfp are also essential for the acquisition of exogenous dna and emergence of strains with novel, heritable characteristics  <cit> . along with lps, porins and the polysaccharide capsule, tfp have been considered as key meningococcal surface structures which undergo extensive variation. studies on the tfp of the related pathogen neisseria gonorrhoeae have revealed that changes in the amino acid sequence of pile , the major subunit of tfp, arise through introduction of segments of non-expressed pils cassettes into the pile expression locus by a unidirectional dna recombination event known as gene conversion  <cit> . this process is enhanced by the presence of the sma/cla repeat and requires the guanine quartet  adjacent to the pile expression locus. the sma/cla repeat is a 66 bp element present at the 3′ end of pile that is proposed to bind proteins to facilitate recombination  <cit> . the g <dig> sequence is located upstream of pile and is necessary for pilin conversion, putatively by acting as a recombination initiation structure  <cit> . more recently a cis-acting small rna has been proposed to assist in the melting of the dna duplex to allow formation of the g <dig> structure  <cit> . high frequency antigenic variation generates remarkable pile diversity, with most of the sequence changes localised to the regions of the protein that are exposed on the surface of the pilus fibre  <cit> , most notably within a region  located near the c-terminus of the protein. gonococcal pilin variation has been detected both in vitro <cit>  and in human volunteer studies  <cit> . meningococcal pilin variation has also been shown in a limited number of isolates in vitro <cit>  and in vivo <cit>  and has been proposed to influence tfp-mediated adhesion  <cit> , serum resistance  <cit>  and to serve as a mechanism for immune evasion.

two classes of tfp  have been described in the neisseria, based on the cross reaction of pile with a monoclonal antibody, sm <dig>  <cit> . this antibody recognizes a conserved epitope in class i, but not class ii pilin  <cit> . furthermore, class ii pilins lack most of the d-region typically seen in gonococccal and meningococcal class i pilins  <cit> . the class ii pile gene was initially described in the n. meningitidis serogroup c strain, fam <dig> and subsequently found in non-pathogenic species, n. lactamica and n. cinerea <cit> . until recently, all pathogenic neisseria were thought to have the ability to alter the sequence of the major pilin subunit through gene conversion; however, pilin variation was not detected in vitro in n. meningitidis strain fam <dig>  or strain nmb, which both express class ii pilin  <cit> . furthermore, in a previous study we found that cc <dig> and cc <dig> isolates of n. meningitidis collected from the uk over a period spanning 30 years harboured highly conserved class ii pile genes which lack variation characteristic of gene conversion  <cit> . similar analysis of the sequence of pile genes in meningococcal isolates from china demonstrated that strains in cc <dig> and cc <dig> also have a highly conserved class ii pile gene  <cit> .

these findings suggest that high frequency pile gene conversion is not universal in pathogenic neisseria, an observation which has important implications for understanding the role of tfp variation during colonisation, transmission and disease. therefore, in this study we interrogated genome sequences of over  <dig> meningococcal isolates to further examine the distribution and sequence conservation of class ii pile genes, and to identify differences in the class i and class ii pile loci which might explain the lack of variability of the class ii pilin gene. our analyses showed that the class i and class ii pile genes are in distinct chromosomal contexts and that isolates with class ii pile contain a more limited repertoire of pils cassettes. furthermore, the g <dig> and sma/cla sequences, which are important for pilin variation, are absent from the class ii pile locus. finally we present evidence of horizontal transfer of class ii pile genes between pathogenic and non-pathogenic neisseria species, which has implications for the evolution of these bacteria.

RESULTS
distribution and diversity of class i and class ii pile in n. meningitidis
draft whole genome sequences hosted on the pubmlst website  <cit>  were interrogated to determine the distribution and diversity of class ii pile genes among n. meningitidis isolates. this included the meningitis research foundation meningococcus genome library , which contains the sequences of  <dig> disease-associated isolates from patients in england, wales and northern ireland during a single epidemiological year , and which represents recently circulating uk disease causing meningococci. in addition wgs of the  <dig> strains of n. meningitidis used to develop and validate mlst, which comprises a diverse collection of meningococci isolated from  <dig> countries collected over a 59 year period   <cit>  were examined.

pilin genes in this collection of isolates were identified by online blast analyses using full-length or partial class i or class ii pile sequences. homologous sequences were manually extracted, translated and designated as either class i or class ii pile based upon relatedness to known pilin genes and the presence of the sm <dig> motif  in the translated sequence. it was not possible to identify full-length pile sequences in all wgs, most likely due to incomplete assembly. from the mrf genomes a total of  <dig> full-length class i pile coding sequences and  <dig> class ii pile coding sequences were identified and in the mlst collection of  <dig> genomes,  <dig> full-length class i pile coding sequences and  <dig> class ii pile coding sequences were found . therefore, in total  <dig> isolates with a full-length class i pile gene and  <dig> isolates with a full-length class ii pile gene were identified . no isolates that contained both a class i and a class ii pile gene were identified.

while there was no association of class ii pile with serogroup, country or year, the presence of a class ii pile gene was consistently associated with a limited group of clonal complexes i.e. cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig> and cc174; no wgs data from isolates belonging to these ccs contained a class i pile gene. only cc <dig> contained isolates with either class i pile  or class ii pile  . thus, the data from the  <dig> mlst and mrf isolate collections confirmed that the presence of class ii pilin is a characteristic of a distinct subset of meningococcal lineages.

the extent of sequence diversity among the  <dig> class i and the  <dig> class ii pile sequences identified in this work was examined, including pile sequences from eight available reference genome sequences, providing an additional six class i pile genes and two class ii pile sequences . allele numbers were assigned to the full-length pile  coding sequences. each of the  <dig> class i pile genes was a unique allele , even in strains of the same sequence type, isolated in the same country and year. in contrast, only  <dig> class ii pile alleles were identified from  <dig> meningococci isolated from  <dig> countries over 74 years, highlighting the sequence conservation of class ii pile genes . there was also evidence for an association between certain class ii pile alleles and particular clonal complexes . for example, 90%  of cc <dig> isolates harboured an identical pile . likewise, all 13 cc <dig> isolates harboured the same pile coding sequence . this allele was also found in strains belonging to cc <dig> and cc <dig>  suggesting horizontal transfer of class ii pile. further evidence of this was allele  <dig>  which was present in strains belonging to cc <dig> and cc <dig>

analysis of the predicted protein sequences showed that for class i pilins most variation occurred within the c-terminal d-region , as expected based on previous studies  <cit> . the  <dig> different class i pile alleles encode  <dig> different pilin subunits with  <dig> different d-regions . in contrast, alignment of the  <dig> unique class ii pilins we identified demonstrates that variation occurs over the entire c-terminal domain and only six different d-regions are encoded .

analysis of pile/pils loci in isolates with class i or class ii pile
in the class i pilin-producing meningococci with closed genome sequences  the class i pile gene and eight pils cassettes are found in a single locus, while in the closed genomes of class ii pilin-producing meningococci fam <dig>  <cit>  and wue <dig>  <cit> , this locus contains a reduced number of pils cassettes and class ii pile is located at a distinct locus . the class i pile gene is located between fkbp  and lpxc  . the silent pils cassettes precede pile and, although there are eight cassettes in each instance, there is variation in their length and spacing. in contrast the class ii pile gene is situated between catalase  and a hypothetical protein , with a conserved hypothetical  and putative oligopeptidase a gene  further downstream . the catalase region in the genomes of mc <dig> and z <dig> does not contain a class ii pile gene . finally, in fam <dig> and wue <dig>  two or three pils cassettes respectively are located in the region between fkbp and lpxc .

to assess the chromosomal context of class i and class ii pile genes and their associated pils repertoires in different groups of meningococcal isolates, we annotated the fkbp-lpxc region and the kata-prlc regions in a subset of wgs in the pubmlst database. where possible groups of isolates with the same sequence type or in the same clonal complex were examined, to enable comparisons both within and between groups of related meningococci. the pils cassettes were defined on the basis of their homology to pile coding sequences. in some cases the lack of available contiguous sequence prevented identification of adjacent open reading frames; examples of class i and class ii pile/pils regions from genomes where the assembly was sufficient are shown in figure  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

class i pile genes were found adjacent to pils cassettes and between fkbp and lpxc in  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated genomes. in the remaining five genomes, it was not possible to determine whether pile was adjacent to lpxc  or pile genes encoding atypical pilin variants  were found, but these were not within in the fkbp-lpxc locus . likewise in cc <dig> isolate m10_ <dig> , the pile/s locus was interrupted by a region homologous to the tspb region of strain fam <dig> . none of these isolates harboured a pile gene in the kata-prlc region .

analysis of pils cassettes in the fkbp-lpxc region of the class i pile-containing isolates revealed diversity in the spacing, number and sequence of the silent cassettes, both among clonal complexes and among isolates belonging to the same clonal complex . this diversity was particularly evident in cc41/ <dig>  where we identified  <dig> different pils sequences from a total of  <dig> cassettes from  <dig> genomes. it should be noted that the analysis of class i strains was specifically targeted to annotate pils cassettes within the fkbp-lpxc region and the presence of additional pils cassettes elsewhere in these genomes could not be excluded. therefore this analysis represents the minimum diversity of pils in isolates with class i pile.

1isolates and pils cassettes included in this analysis are shown in figure  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig>  isolates id  <dig> , id  <dig> , and id  <dig>  were excluded due to incomplete contig assembly in regions containing pile/pils loci.

the pils and pile sequences within each isolate were examined for evidence of past intra-strain gene conversion events. of note, for all isolates with a class i pile gene, it was possible to identify pils cassettes with sequences corresponding to those found in the pile d-region. in most cases the d-region was a hybrid, likely resulting from multiple recombination events, whilst in some instances a single pils donor could be proposed based on full sequence identity .

annotation of genomes with class ii pile revealed that this gene was present in a region defined as the kata-prlc region . all these regions had identical genetic organisation, except isolate  <dig> , which lacks the conserved hypothetical protein . furthermore, all genomes with class ii pile had fewer pils cassettes than class i isolates - usually two or three in the region between fkbp and lpxc . further blast analyses of these class ii genomes were performed to identify whether pils cassettes were also in other loci. the only homologous sequences identified were located on contigs containing the region between fkbp and lpxc , suggesting that there was only a single pils locus in these isolates. although incomplete genome assembly preventing additional pils identification in this study cannot be excluded, the fully assembled, closed genome sequences of reference strains fam <dig> and wue <dig> do not contain pils cassettes located elsewhere.

in comparison to strains with class i pile, the pils regions in these class ii isolates were highly conserved within a clonal complex in terms of number and arrangement of pils cassettes . for example, there were only four different pils sequences out of  <dig> cassettes in 32 cc <dig> isolates . the pils cassettes in class ii isolates shared greater similarities with class i pile than class ii pile as previously observed  <cit> . furthermore, we were unable to identify any pils cassettes encoding sequences corresponding to those found in the d-regions of any class ii pilin proteins. this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, in these class ii isolates, pils cassettes are not functioning as donors for intra-strain recombination events associated with pilin antigenic variation.

analysis of dna sequences associated with pile gene conversion
the g <dig> and sma/cla elements have been shown to be required for efficient antigenic variation of pilin  <cit> . each of these sequences was found in the region 5′ or 3′ to the class i pile gene, respectively . four isolates lacked a full length sma/cla adjacent to pile, three of which also presented atypical pile sequence and/or arrangement; for example, cc41/ <dig> isolate  , has an atypical pile sequence and lacks a sma/cla sequence, while cc <dig> isolates id  <dig> and id  <dig>  have a sma/cla sequence adjacent to pils but in these genomes pile is no longer found in the fkbp-lpxc region.

we also analysed the regions flanking the class ii pile alleles for presence of the sma/cla and g <dig> sequences. we did not detect sequences corresponding to a functional g <dig> motif   <cit>  in the region 5′ to any class ii pile gene. furthermore, the sma/cla repeat was absent from the region 3′ to the class ii pile genes, although sequences identical or highly homologous to the published meningococcal sma/cla repeat  <cit>  were present in the pils loci of these isolates . therefore, the absence of motifs that are important for pile/pils recombination adjacent to the class ii pile gene is likely to contribute to the lack of antigenic variation of class ii pile.

defining meningococcal class ii pilins
class ii pilins were initially identified by their lack of cross reaction with monoclonal antibody sm <dig> which was developed to differentiate between structural classes of tfp on gonococci and meningococci  <cit> . sm <dig> recognises an epitope  present at the end of the conserved n-terminus of class i pilin  <cit> . our analysis confirms that all the pilins encoded by the class i pile contain this motif, while in the class ii pilins this motif is either eyysn  or eyysd  . western blot analysis of whole cell extracts from strains expressing class ii pilin subunits with different sm <dig> sequences was undertaken . as expected, sm <dig> detected class i pilin in the control strain  <dig>  and did not recognise the class ii pilin from fam <dig> . however, class ii pilin from cc <dig> strain  <dig> , does cross react with sm <dig>  this suggests that sm <dig> reactivity may not be sufficient to distinguish class i and class ii pilin in all meningococci. we therefore compared all the pilin sequences from our analysis to examine the presence and conservation of additional differentiating features . the sequence of the leader peptides were distinct  as was the length of the c-terminus , which comprises one to three amino acids in class ii pilins, in contrast to seven in full-length, functional class i pilins. most notably, all pilins encoded by the class ii pile genes were smaller, mostly due to a significantly shorter d-region, which is  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids in length compared with  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in class i pilins . based on this analysis, we propose the adoption of a sequence-based distinction between class i and class ii pilins, rather than a definition based on antigenic properties .

analysis of pile in non-pathogenic neisseria species
it has previously been shown that class ii pile is also present in non-pathogenic neisseria <cit> . we therefore analysed pile sequences in genomes of  <dig> isolates of non-pathogenic neisseria available in pubmlst. this collection comprised  <dig> different species isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from various hosts and sites. in total 44/ <dig> wgs from non-pathogenic neisseria were found to have full-length sequences homologous to pile . split decomposition network analysis of these  <dig> pile sequences with both class i and class ii pile genes from  <dig> n. meningitidis isolates from different clonal complexes, revealed that all meningococcal class i pile clustered together . in contrast, the meningococcal class ii pile clustered on a separate branch together with pile from n. lactamica, n. polysaccharea and one n. cinerea isolate. other non-pathogenic neisseria species displayed more divergent pile sequences. we analysed the sequences flanking the putative pile genes in the genomes of all non-pathogenic neisseria strains where there was sufficient sequence available on the pile-containing contig. nine species contained a second putative pilin gene adjacent to the initial pile homologue , in agreement with previous reports  <cit>  and in these species the regions flanking pile did not resemble those found adjacent to either the class i or class ii meningococcal pile. in contrast, the genetic organisation of open reading frames around the pile gene in n. lactamica and n. polysaccharea was similar to the genomic region surrounding the meningococcal class ii pile gene , although only one non-pathogenic neisseria isolate  was found to harbour the hp gene which is found in the meningococcal class ii pile locus.

discussion
two different classes of pilin  have been described in pathogenic neisseria <cit>  and the genes encoding these pilins are distinguishable  <cit> . here we have taken advantage of available whole genome sequences to provide a more comprehensive view of the distribution and genetic context of meningococcal class i and class ii pile. these analyses reveal a possible basis for the evident lack of gene conversion of class ii pile and we provide insights into the likely origin of the meningococcal class ii pile gene.

previous analysis of pile sequences in n. meningitidis isolate collections from the uk  <cit>  and china  <cit>  suggested an association of the class ii pile gene with certain lineages, especially those responsible for epidemic meningococcal disease . in the present analysis, two large and well characterised isolate collections enabled the assessment of class ii pile distribution in isolates from a single country in one year, and in isolates collected over decades from diverse global locations. the data demonstrate that the association of class ii pile with these hyperinvasive lineages is maintained, regardless of the country or the year they were isolated, and highlights that class ii pile is present in lineages which are responsible for a large proportion of disease. for example, the  <dig> isolate mlst collection analysed in this study contains cc <dig> and cc <dig> isolates from countries of the african meningitis belt . the majority of epidemic meningococcal disease has occurred in this region and has been mostly caused by serogroup a meningococci belonging to cc <dig> or cc <dig>  <cit> ; in particular three clones  have been largely responsible for meningococcal disease in africa over the last 20 years  <cit> .

in addition, we found class ii pile genes in strains from cc <dig> and cc <dig>  an increase in carriage of cc <dig> strains was reported in the uk from 1999- <dig>  <cit>  and isolates from cc <dig> accounted for approximately 20% of serogroup y meningococcal disease during 2007- <dig> in the uk and were associated with disease in older age groups  <cit> ; however, only 9/ <dig> disease isolates from the uk in 2010- <dig> belong to this complex. therefore, there is currently insufficient information to determine whether strains belonging to this clonal complex are hyperinvasive and/or associated with epidemic disease. it is possible that the groups of strains with class ii pile may expand with increasing availability of strain collections and whole genome sequences and consequently the association of class ii pile with strains that have particular epidemiological characteristics should become clearer.

a class ii pilin gene was identified in one isolate from cc <dig>  which was of particular interest as we also identified isolates in this clonal complex that possess a class i pile gene . this was inconsistent with our previous analysis which indicated that isolates within clonal complexes were uniform with respect to pilin class . cc <dig> meningococci are reported to be genetically homogeneous and were responsible for epidemics in the meningitis belt from the 1960s to the early 1990s  <cit> . the cc <dig> isolate with class ii pile was the oldest strain in the collection, isolated in  <dig>  while the two strains with class i pile were from  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that there may have been a shift from class ii pile to class i pile in cc <dig>  it is interesting to note that the cc <dig> complex has been replaced as the major cause of disease in the meningitis belt by cc <dig> or more recently cc <dig> meningococci, both of which have class ii pile <cit> .

our analysis confirms that class ii pilins in meningococci are antigenically stable. for example, we found that a serogroup w isolate  responsible for disease in the uk in  <dig>  has an identical pile sequence to a serogroup b isolate , isolated from the usa in  <dig>  this contrasts with the finding that every class i pilin had a different sequence, even from strains with the same sequence type, isolated from the same country, during the same year. the extensive variation of class i pile is consistent with the ability of single strains to generate pilin diversity through the recombination between pils cassettes and the pile expression locus  <cit> . indeed, for the majority of isolates with class i pile the putative donor pils cassettes could be identified. although pils cassettes were found in all isolates which harboured a class ii pile gene, it was not possible to identify any class ii pile sequences that contained d-region information corresponding to pils cassettes. therefore, the wgs analysis provides further evidence for a lack of pile/s recombination in class ii pilin producing meningococci. a possible explanation for the low variability of the class ii pile genes is the absence of the g <dig> sequence that is required for pilin conversion. the current hypothesis is that the formation of a guanine quartet on the lagging strand stalls dna replication, leading to a nick on the leading strand and initiating antigenic variation  <cit> . therefore, in the absence of a functional g <dig> adjacent to pile, these strains would lack the ability to initiate pilin conversion, although recent work suggests that additional factors may contribute to the lack of pilin variation  <cit> . in this respect, isolates expressing class ii pilin provide a useful tool for systematically dissecting the molecular and genetic elements required for pilin variation.

these results also raise questions concerning the origin of the meningococcal class ii pile locus. the analysis of pile genes in pathogenic and non-pathogenic neisseria indicates that the n. meningitidis class ii pile is more closely related to pile from non-pathogenic species than to the class i pile from meningococci, in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . these observations are consistent with horizontal gene transfer among neisseria species which has been observed by others  <cit>  and is likely, given that diverse species share a biological niche within the human host. furthermore, we found one isolate of n. polysaccharea with the hp gene adjacent to pile. this gene, which encodes a putative transposase from haemophilus influenzae, is consistently found next to the class ii pile gene in meningococci. therefore this provides additional evidence in support of genetic exchange around the pile locus among these species.

in addition to differences in pile, meningococci producing class ii pilin had fewer pils cassettes  in the region between lpxc and fkbp than isolates with class i pilin . one possible explanation for this finding is that the lpxc-fkbp region of existing class ii strains represents a remnant of an ancestral class i pile/pils region, and that these class ii isolates have at some point acquired a class ii pile gene and lost the class i expression locus and some pils cassettes. interestingly, no genomes with both a class i and a class ii pile gene were found in this study. it is also noteworthy that recent genomic analysis indicates that pathogenic neisseria evolved from a common ancestor shared with n. polysaccharea <cit> , which has a class ii pile gene. this could suggest a second possible scenario in which the class ii pile locus is ancestral in n. meningitidis and the class i pils/pile locus is a more recent trait which has arisen in specific lineages.

tfp are surface structures which are exposed to the host environment in both colonisation and disease, and are thus presumed targets of the immune system. consequently pilin variation has largely been assumed to provide meningococci with an effective mechanism of immune evasion. indeed, anti-pilus antibodies can be found in patients infected with n. meningitidis <cit>  and gonococcal tfp containing class i pilin are immunogenic in human volunteer studies  <cit>  although there is no clear role for anti-pile antibodies in protection against meningococcal infection  <cit> . our finding that some clonal complexes express conserved class ii pilin subunits is not consistent with host immunity-driven pilin variation in these strains, and is reminiscent of the lack of diversification of other surface proteins such as porb, pora, and feta in some hyperinvasive strains  <cit> . however, we found some evidence of class ii pile gene exchange between unrelated isolates , indicating that recombination following uptake of exogenous dna is a potential mechanism of generating class ii pilin variation. a better understanding of the immune responses to class i and class ii pilins should provide insight as to why distinct hyperinvasive lineages have evolved different potential for sequence variation of the tfp major subunit.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we show that class ii pilins can be defined by amino acid sequence and genomic context and are present in n. meningitidis strains which have persisted and spread globally over several decades and are responsible for meningococcal disease worldwide. furthermore the class ii pile gene is present in non-pathogenic neisseria, including n. polysaccharea and n. lactamica. despite the presence of pils cassettes as potential donors of genetic variation in meningococci producing class ii pilins, we found no evidence that class ii pile recombines with pils to generate pilin variation. given the importance of tfp in pathogen-host interaction, we propose that possession of class i or class ii pile is likely to impact bacterial behaviour, either through different capacity of strains to alter the sequence of the major pilus component or directly, through the inherent properties of the specific pilin subunits. for example, particular sequences of class i pilins affect key tfp functions by influencing cell tropism or adhesion  <cit> . additionally, specific amino acids in the d-region can affect pilus bundling  <cit>  and this has recently been linked to serum resistance  <cit> . it is possible that class ii pilins are highly conserved in certain lineages because they confer specific properties important for interactions within the host. future work will be directed at understanding how these different pilin genes have evolved and their impact upon meningococcal biology.
