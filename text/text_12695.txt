BACKGROUND
focal cerebral ischemia results from a reduction in cerebral blood flow to a discrete region of the brain, initiating a complex process that includes release of excitatory neurotransmitters and activation of apoptotic pathways. even though regional cerebral blood flow is restored to near normal values after two hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion  followed by reperfusion  <cit> , a cerebral infarct of about 25% of total brain volume occurs consistently  <cit> . some manifestations of the ischemic damage are break-down of the blood-brain barrier , activation of inflammatory cascades, and disruption of basement membranes and extracellular matrix via cytokine-induced alterations in the expression of metalloproteinases  and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- <dig>   <cit> . mmps are a family of zinc-binding proteolytic enzymes that can degrade structural proteins of the extracellular matrix  and cleave other non-ecm molecules ranging from growth factor precursors, cytokines, and binding proteins, to cell surface receptors  <cit> . in the central nervous system, mmp- <dig> is involved in disruption of the bbb by degrading tight junction proteins  <cit> . the proteolytic activity of mmps is tightly controlled by tissue inhibitors of mmps  <cit> . by degrading the neurovascular matrix, mmps promote bbb injury, causing brain oedema and haemorrhage. inhibition of mmp- <dig> prevents tight junction protein degradation  <cit> , while excessive expression of mmps contributes to the pathological processes. for example, mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> are upregulated during cerebral ischemia, however their temporal regulation differs. mmp- <dig> plays a pivotal role in the degradation of the bbb after focal cerebral ischemia  <cit>  and is also expressed in human brain tissue after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke  <cit> . there is an early increase in mmp- <dig> expression in the microvascular walls after cerebral ischemia and selective inhibition of mmp- <dig> reduces the brain injury after stroke  <cit> . mmp- <dig> peaks at  <dig> hours while mmp- <dig> peaks at  <dig> days post stroke. it has been suggested that the balance between mmps and timp- <dig> plays a significant role in experimental reperfusion injury  <cit>  and in human stroke  <cit> .

in previous studies, we observed rapid transcriptional upregulation of contractile endothelin etb and angiotensin at <dig> receptors within the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells in the ischemic region in mcao-induced focal cerebral ischemia and experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage  <cit> . it is possible that this upregulation promotes the formation of the penumbral damage via enhanced contraction of the vasculature leading to and within the ischemic region, especially considering that the receptor ligands  are formed in the cerebrovascular endothelium  <cit> .

therefore, we examined the early changes in the expression of mmps and timps, mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> in particular. this study demonstrates, for the first time, the enhanced expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> after mcao followed by reperfusion in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. detailed immunocytochemical analysis revealed that this enhanced expression was not associated with other elements of the vessel walls or with glial end-feet or neurons. we asked whether this enhanced expression was associated with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases , a family that includes extracellular signal-regulated kinases , p <dig> mapk, and c-jun n-terminal kinases , which transmit extracellular signals into the nucleus to modulate protein expression. previously, we observed that erk1/ <dig> was activated early, resulting in cerebrovascular receptor upregulation, while p <dig> and jnk were activated only after 1– <dig> days  <cit> . this observation was validated by the results of systemic administration of the specific mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig>  <cit> , which blunted the enhanced activity of the mek/erk pathway in the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. in addition, we found that mek1/ <dig> inhibition reduced the infarct size, improved neurological function, and normalized the enhanced expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> that follows ischemic injury.

RESULTS
in this study, we used the rat model of inducible cerebral ischemia: rats were subjected to reversible mcao for  <dig> hours followed by reperfusion for  <dig> hours  <cit> . the mcao produced an occlusion visible by laser doppler flowmetry as an abrupt 80–90% reduction in local cortical blood flow that normalized after removal of the occluding thread . there were no significant differences in physiological parameters between the different treatment groups for blood pressure, blood gases, temperature, plasma glucose, and body weight . following rapid sacrifice, we collected tissue for immunocytochemistry, western blot, and calculation of infarct volume . neurological evaluations were performed just before animal sacrifice .

analysis of infarct volume, neurological examination, and vessel wall protein expression
previously, immunocytochemical and western blot analyses showed that mcao with reperfusion caused activation of the mek/erk pathway in cerebral vessels associated with the ischemic region  <cit> ; data from our study confirm this observation. firstly, intravenous administration of the mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig> at  <dig> or  <dig> hours after the two-hour mcao and initiation of reperfusion significantly reduced the infarct volume  and improved neurological assessment scores . when u <dig> treatment was initiated  <dig> hours after the start of reperfusion, there was no significant reduction in infarct volume or neurological score as compared to control animals . secondly, after mcao, perk1/ <dig> activity in the vascular smooth muscle cells was upregulated in large cerebral arteries  and in microvessels  but not in adjacent brain tissue , as previously shown  <cit> . u <dig> treatment initiated at zero or  <dig> hours after initiation of reperfusion normalized vascular perk1/ <dig> expression .

expression of mmp- <dig> and timp-1
subsequently, we examined the mca, cerebral microvessels, and the surrounding brain tissue in the ischemic region and on the contralateral side for changes in expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> protein at  <dig> hours post mcao. we found markedly enhanced expression of mmp- <dig> in the vascular smooth muscle cells from the ischemic region; the expression was localized to the cytoplasm, leaving the nuclear regions clear of mmp- <dig> immunoreactivity . timp- <dig> expression was observed in the media layer, but was located closer to the adventitia layer of the cerebral vessel walls and hence only to some degree in the smooth muscle cells . quantitative evaluation of the expression levels revealed significant upregulation of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> after mcao in the mca and in the microvessels, while only faint staining was seen in vehicle-treated animals . results from double immunostaining for mmp- <dig> or timp- <dig>  and actin revealed that the expression of these proteins was localized to the smooth muscle cells in the mca and cerebral microvasculature ; however, their distributions varied slightly . cd <dig> was used as a marker of endothelial cells; neither mmp- <dig> nor timp- <dig> revealed any major co-localization with cd <dig> , hence the upregulation occurred in the media layer. the results from western blot experiments of mcas  showed that the protein levels of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> were significantly increased after mcao as compared to vehicle-treated animals . administration of the mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig> immediately after the initiation of reperfusion  decreased the levels of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> proteins by  <dig> ± 11% and  <dig> ± 10%, respectively .

association with astrocyte end-feet
gfap is a selective marker of astrocytes, which are known to be intimately associated with cerebral microvasculature  <cit> . we detected no gfap-immunopositive end-feet in the walls of the mca  but confirmed that there is a rich network of gfap-positive astrocytes in the cerebral cortex tissue . here, the astrocytic end-feet surrounded the microvasculature, as previously described <cit> . mmp- <dig> immunoreactions in the mca and the microvessels were clearly dissociated from gfap-positive staining at all time points studied. however, in the microvessels , the astrocytic end-feet closely encircled the vessel walls and came adjacent to the smooth muscle cells but only in the outermost part of the media layer, showing a slight merging under confocal microscopy. the situation for timp- <dig> was different; timp- <dig> immunoreactivity was mainly present in the outer part of the media layer and in the adventitia of the cerebral vessels, still closely associated with the smooth muscle cells, as demonstrated in co-localization studies with actin. in this part of the vessel walls mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> co-located . in microvessels, the association with astrocytic end-feet was more intimate because both gfap and timp- <dig> immunoreactivity occurred in the outermost part of the media and in the adventitia, sometimes appearing merged in the walls of the microvessels .

inhibition of mek1/ <dig> activity in vivo
next, we assessed whether the mek/erk pathway was activated in the walls of the mca, the microvessels, and surrounding brain tissue following mcao. results from immunostaining with perk1/2-specific antibodies showed that perk1/ <dig> expression in the smooth muscle cells in the vasculature was significantly increased in the ischemic region at  <dig> hours post mcao . systemic administration of the mek1/2-specific inhibitor u <dig>  <cit>  either immediately after release of the occlusion  or  <dig> hours post mcao recirculation effectively abolished the increase in perk1/ <dig> activity in the ischemic mca and the cerebral microvessels . however, there was no visible alteration in perk1/ <dig> activity in brain tissue of the ischemic  or contralateral regions .

treatment with u <dig>  significantly decreased the upregulation of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> in both the mca and the cerebral microvessels within the infarct area  but no difference in brain tissue per se . however, administration of u <dig> beginning  <dig> hours after reperfusion did not significantly reduce the ischemia-induced expression of mmp- <dig> or timp- <dig> in the cerebral vessel smooth muscle cells . these results were confirmed at the protein level by western blot.

discussion
this is the first study to clearly demonstrate that two-hour mcao followed by  <dig> hours of reperfusion results in significant upregulation of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> in the smooth muscle cells of the mca and in microvessels within the ischemic region. furthermore, our data show that this upregulation is associated with upregulation of perk1/ <dig> and normalized by inhibition of the mek/erk pathway.

to determine the cellular source of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig>  we performed confocal microscopy and co-localization studies using smooth muscle actin-specific antibodies. mmp- <dig> immunoreactivity was localized to the cytoplasm of the cerebral vessel smooth muscle cells, both in the mca and in intracerebral microvessels. although minor amounts of actin has been observed in endothelial cells we could easily dissociate microscopically the endothelium from the smooth muscle cells as they are separated by an inner elastic lamina  <cit> . in addition, some vessels were studied after mechanical removal of the endothelium. after this procedure the localization of the immunoreactions to the smooth muscle cells was still confirmed . this increase in immunoreactivity agrees with a previously reported increase in mmp- <dig> mrna and protein expression in the ischemic tissue at  <dig> hours after mcao , and this correlated with opening of the bbb  <cit> . these investigators observed that mmp- <dig> co-localized with gfap-expressing astrocytes and with neurons in the lateral and piriform cortices, but not in the vessel walls  <cit> . it was also shown that increased mmp- <dig> activity was associated with a reduction in junction proteins in cerebrovascular endothelial cells and in bbb disruption after focal ischemia  <cit> . detailed analysis revealed that these events were caused by mmp-9-mediated degradation of the junction proteins claudin- <dig> and occludin. in support of these data, the administration of an mmp- <dig> blocker prevented this degradation and abolished the bbb damage  <cit> .

there exist some data on the time-dependency of the elevation in expression of mmp- <dig> in the cerebral vessel walls. thus, the direct comparison of mmp- <dig> expression in the present ischemic model with that seen in experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage  and after organ culture of isolated mca segments revealed enhanced levels of mmp- <dig> mrna at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs  <cit> . the time-course was studied in more detail after experimental sah; the main expression of mmp- <dig> was seen at  <dig> hours  <cit> .

the specific mek <dig> inhibitor u <dig> does not affect phosphorylation of p <dig> or jnk in cultured neurons  <cit>  or in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells in vivo using the present model of ischemia  <cit> . detailed western blot experiments have confirmed the specificity of u <dig> on the mek/erk pathway  <cit> . therefore, we can rule out that u <dig> acts via non-specific inhibition of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory mechanisms since unknown non-mek effects cannot be ruled out. u <dig> has been found to increase mek1/ <dig> phosphorylation in cortical neurons, thus u <dig> does not affect components upstream of mek1/ <dig>  <cit> . hence, it is reasonable to assume that the neuroprotective effect of u <dig> results from the inhibition of cerebrovascular mek1/ <dig> activity, which agrees with the observed reductions in the activity of the downstream mapk, perk1/ <dig>  in this study, we showed that mcao resulted in enhanced expression of perk1/ <dig> in smooth muscle cells of the ischemic mca and associated microvessels  but not in the surrounding brain tissue; u <dig> blunted this activation, reduced the infarct volume, and improved the neurological assessment scores of treated rats. intriguingly, inhibiting this sequence of events correlated with the inhibition of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> expression in the same location. quantitative real time-pcr demonstrated enhanced mrna expression of mmp- <dig>  <dig> hours after mcao in cerebral blood vessels in focal ischemia, and at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after experimental sah  <cit> . our data indicate, for the first time, that the expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> in cerebral blood vessel smooth muscle cells is enhanced after cerebral ischemia and that this enhancement is a transcriptional event. while constitutively expressed mmp- <dig> is involved in an early brief loosening of tight junctions and the initial reversible opening of the bbb, mmp- <dig> expression increases with time, is more durable, and is possibly related to increased neuroinflammation  <cit> . importantly, the opening of the bbb is associated with brain damage and our observations reveal a mechanism by which to modify the expression of mmp- <dig>  thereby reducing the risk of brain damage: inhibiting mek1/ <dig> 

although mek/erk-pathway mechanisms play a crucial roles in mediating brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion, and inhibiting this pathway can reduce the infarct size  <cit> , we provide direct evidence supporting an explanation for some of the events related to the focal pathology of cerebral ischemia  <cit> . u <dig> administration diminished perk1/ <dig> immunoreactivity in the ischemic brain of the mouse  <cit>  and in the mca of the rat  <cit> . in the mouse model, three hours of mcao was followed by  <dig> hours of reperfusion. interestingly, the infarct volume was affected only if u <dig> was given in conjunction with the mcao  <cit> . furthermore, in a permanent mcao model, pre-treatment with u <dig> was necessary to inhibit pmek1/2/perk1/ <dig> expression in vivo in the mouse brain in both the ischemic core and perifocal regions  <cit> . also, the specificity of the antagonism revealed that u <dig> does not inhibit the cellular synthesis of erk1/ <dig> but does block the erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation and activation of, for example, the transcription factor elk- <dig>  <cit> . in agreement with our observations, mek1/ <dig> inhibition does not alter cortical blood flow within the first few hours of administration  <cit>  or modify the contractility of isolated cerebral arteries . hence, u <dig> does not act on the cerebral circulation through a direct vasodilator mechanism. instead, we suggest that u <dig> blunts receptor upregulation  <cit> .

here, we have demonstrated yet another positive effect of u0126: blocking the enhanced expression of mmp- <dig>  which participates in the destruction of the bbb and subsequent brain oedema. more importantly, systemic administration of u <dig> markedly reduced the infarct size and improved neurological function, even when the first dose was given as late as  <dig> hours after the initiation of reperfusion. clearly, these data differ to some degree from those found in previous reports. while u <dig> is a well-known inhibitor of mek1/ <dig>  it has a questionable permeability of the bbb. in order to overcome this hurdle, we used a much higher dosage of u <dig>  than that used by others, which still did not alter any physiological parameters and was well tolerated by the rats. this dosage is much higher than that necessary to inhibit the mek/erk pathway in cell culture but is necessary to allow a sufficient dosage to reach the abluminal side of the bbb; this was verified by protein expression using both immunohistochemistry and western blot. we verified the success of the antagonism by demonstrating that mca and cerebral microvascular perk1/ <dig> activities were reduced to control levels and this reduction was associated with a significant reduction in infarct size and reduced expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig>  if u <dig> treatment was initiated  <dig> hours after the start of reperfusion, there was no significant effect on the above parameters. therefore, at this dosage, the mek <dig> inhibitor u <dig> may have a therapeutic window.

CONCLUSIONS
we hypothesise that mek/erk inhibition might represent a way to prevent stroke-induced pathology because it targets several transcriptional mechanisms activated by cerebral ischemia, such as receptor upregulation, which causes enhanced contractility, and mmp- <dig> and timp <dig> activation, which affect the function of the bbb. inhibition of the mek/erk pathway applied as late as  <dig> hours after the start of reperfusion significantly reduced the infarct volume and the expression of bbb-associated proteins mmp- <dig> and timp <dig> in the cerebral vessel walls. thus, the positive effects of mek/erk inhibition might involve several mechanisms in the mca and in brain microvasculature associated with the cerebral ischemia. however, the dosage required to reach targets on the abluminal side of the bbb is a factor that warrants further study.
