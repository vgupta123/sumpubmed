BACKGROUND
protein tyrosine phosphatases  act in a coordinated manner with protein tyrosine kinases to control cell signaling thereby regulating various physiological processes  <cit> . malfunctioning of these enzymes has major pathological implications. one of the best known examples is the allelic variant of the lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase lyp  which is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, type  <dig> diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease  <cit> .

lyp is a cytoplasmic enzyme belonging to the pest group of non-receptor classical ptps  <cit> . it contains  <dig> amino acid residues. the murine ortholog of lyp is called pep  <cit> . lyp and pep share 89% and 61% sequence identity in their ptp domains and noncatalytic portions, respectively. the n-terminal part of lyp/pep contains the catalytic domain conserved in all classical ptps. the structure of the sequence following the catalytic domain is largely undefined. the last  <dig> amino acid segment contains  <dig> proline-rich sequence motifs  which presumably provides docking sites for sh <dig> domain-containing signaling proteins. the first of these motifs, p <dig>  is known to bind with relatively high stoichiometry to the sh <dig> domain of the csk tyrosine kinase, an important negative regulator of t-cell antigen receptor signaling  <cit> . lyp/pep and csk appear to have complementary functions. while csk phosphorylates the negative regulatory tyrosine residue at the c-terminal end of lck and fyn, lyp/pep dephosphorylates the positive regulatory site in the middle of these two tyrosine kinases  <cit> . both actions result in inhibition of tcr signaling. lyp/pep also negatively regulates t cell signaling by dephosphorylating zap- <dig> and the tyrosyl residues within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in cd <dig> ζ-chains, which are phosphorylated by src family tyrosine kinases  <cit> . further studies by using a substrate-trapping mutant of lyp in combination with mass spectrometry identified the following substrates: lck , zap- <dig> , vav, valosin-containing protein, and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in cd <dig> ζ-chains  <cit> . lyp/pep is predominately expressed in lymphocytes, and it is generally defined as a key inhibitor of t-cell activation.

a major advancement in the study of lyp is the finding of a single nucleotide polymorphism , namely, c1858t, which generates an r620w amino acid substitution . this snp is a common risk factor for many autoimmune diseases, including type i diabetes  <cit> , systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , and graves' disease  <cit> . the  <dig> amino acid residue is located within the first protein-rich motif p <dig>  which interacts with the sh <dig> domain of csk  <cit> . the r620w amino acid substitution presumably interrupts the interaction of p <dig> with the sh <dig> domain of csk  <cit> . however, a later study revealed that the r620w substitution is actually a gain-of-function mutation that generates a more active ptp that acts as a more effective inhibitor of t-cell signaling than the wild-type enzyme  <cit> . the mechanism by which this r620w substitution in the non-catalytic segment leads to activation of the phosphatase remains to be defined. it was postulated that this activating mutation in lyp may cause a predisposition to autoimmune disease either by failure to delete auto-reactive t cells or due to insufficient activity of regulatory t cells  <cit> . in any event, the c-terminal part of lyp has a crucial role in regulating the catalytic activity of lyp and its physiological functions. in this study, we isolated a new variant form of lyp designated lyp <dig> which differs from lyp <dig>  the known isoform of lyp, in the c-terminal region right after the r620w substitution site. we found that the expression level of lyp <dig> relative to lyp <dig> varies in different tissues and among different individuals.

methods
materials
total rnas were isolated from de-identified human peripheral blood samples by using the trizol reagent  and were then treated with rq <dig> rnase-free dnase  to remove contaminated genomic dnas. first-strand cdna was synthesized by using the iscript cdna synthesis kit  with random primers. human major tissue qpcr array containing first strand dnas from  <dig> tissues was purchased from origene.

molecular cloning of lyp
based on the coding sequence of lyp in genbank database, two pcr primers, namely, lyp5'  and lyp3'  were synthesized. they correspond to the 5' and 3' ends of the coding sequence of lyp <dig>  respectively. single-strand cdnas synthesized with total rnas purified from human peripheral blood samples were used as templates. the pcr was run for  <dig> cycles with phusion polymerase  at 94°c for  <dig> sec, 65°c for  <dig> sec, and 72°c for  <dig> min. the pcr products were ligated with t <dig> dna ligase into the pbluescript ks vector which was opened by digestion with ecorv. clones were selected based on blue-white selection, and plasmid dnas were isolated for sequencing analyses with t <dig> and t <dig> primers by using the automatic dna sequencing facility at the oklahoma medical research foundation.

determination of tissue distributions of lyp <dig>  lyp <dig>  and lyp3
to determine the expression of lyp <dig>  lyp <dig>  and lyp <dig> in various human tissues, we employed the human major tissue qpcr array  containing first strand dnas from  <dig> tissues. the pcr primers were l <dig> , l1r , l2r , and l <dig> . these primers were derived from different exons on the lyp gene and are expected to give rise to distinct pcr products for lyp <dig>  lyp <dig>  and lyp <dig> cdnas. l <dig> and l1r produce  <dig> and  <dig> bp fragments from lyp <dig> and lyp <dig>  respectively; l <dig> and l2r amplify a  <dig> bp fragment from lyp <dig> only; l <dig> and l1r specifically yield a  <dig> bp fragment of lyp <dig>  the pcr was run for 35- <dig> cycles, and the conditions were 94°c for  <dig> sec, 63°c for  <dig> sec, and 72°c for  <dig> min. the products were analyzed on  <dig> % agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide or on 8% acrylamide gels visualized by using silver staining.

RESULTS
identification of lyp <dig>  a variant form of lyp
in order to clone the full-length form of lyp <dig>  we designed a pair of primers that cover the entire coding sequence of lyp <dig> . single-strand cdnas from a human peripheral blood sample were used as templates for pcr, and the pcr products were cloned into the pbluescript ks vector. interestingly, dna sequencing analyses revealed clones carrying the expected lyp <dig> but also a variant form of lyp which is  <dig> bp shorter in cdna corresponding to a  <dig> amino acid deletion. since there is a variant form of lyp <dig> in the genbank database , we designate the new isoform lyp <dig>  the dna sequence of lyp <dig> has been deposited in the genbank database under accession no. gu <dig>  figure  <dig> shows a sequence alignment of amino acid residues of the three forms of lyp at the c-terminal regions where these three isoforms differ. lyp <dig> contains an n-terminal ptp domain, a central region of unknown function, and a c-terminal portion of approximately  <dig> amino acids containing four proline-rich motifs termed p1-p <dig>  p <dig> is part of the so-called c-terminal homology  domain, which is found in all members of the pest group of ptps  <cit> . lyp <dig> differs from lyp <dig> in that it is missing  <dig> amino acid residues in between the p <dig> and p <dig> region. p <dig> is known to interact with the sh <dig> domain of the csk tyrosine kinase, an important negative regulator of t-cell antigen receptor signaling  <cit> . shortening of the p1-p <dig> linker region may affect the csk/lyp interaction and other unidentified interactions. it should be noted that the c1858t snp happens to cause the r620w substitution in the p <dig> region. in addition, lyp <dig>  another variant form of lyp, has an even shorter c terminus lacking p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> 

lyp <dig> is an alternative splicing product
a search of the human genome database by using the blast program revealed that lyp <dig> is a result of alternative rna splicing. both lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> consist of  <dig> exons with the translation initiation and termination codons residing in the first and last exons, respectively. all the intron-exon junctions follow the gt-ag rule. lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> differ in exon  <dig> where lyp <dig> is  <dig> bp shorter. figure  <dig> also shows the exon-intron structure of lyp <dig>  lyp <dig> has a longer exon  <dig> which contains an in-frame termination codon. to verify the presence of lyp <dig>  we designed primers l <dig> and l1r that amplify both lyp <dig> and lyp <dig>  pcr results demonstrated the presence of the shorter lyp <dig> product in blood samples . interestingly, the relative ratios of lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> appeared to differ among samples from different individuals. dna sequencing analyses of gel-purified pcr products confirmed that the shorter product indeed corresponded to lyp <dig> which is  <dig> bp shorter than the longer lyp <dig> pcr product . we also employed a pair of primers  to amplify lyp <dig> specifically. data in figure 3d illustrated a single band of expected size for all  <dig> blood samples. these blood samples analyzed here were collected from various de-identified normal volunteers and patients. we do not yet know if these differential expressions of lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> correlate with any disease phenotype.

distribution of three isoforms of lyp in human tissues
as its name indicates, lyp was initially thought to be expressed specifically in lymphocytes. this was based on the northern blotting analyses of a limited number of human tissues  and cell lines  <cit> . however, subsequent studies revealed expression of lyp in normal granulocytes and monocytes and a number of myeloid cell lines  <cit> . we felt that it was necessary to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of lyp expression. for this purpose, we employed the human major tissue qpcr array from origene. the array contains the first strand cdnas of  <dig> human tissues. the cdnas have been normalized with house keeping genes, and thus pcr data represent relative expressions of specific genes in different human tissues. we first performed pcr with primers that cover both lyp <dig> and lyp <dig>  the data shown in the upper four panels of figure  <dig> demonstrate that both lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> are highly expressed in major lymphoid tissues . they are also expressed at a high level in lung and fat and at lower levels in many other tissues including adrenal gland, colon, duodenum, intestine, intracranial artery, pituitary, rectum, skin, stomach, testis, tonsil, ureter, urinary bladder, and uterus. these tissues can be considered as the mucosa-associated lymphoid system which contains small concentrations of diffuse lymphoid cells. however, it is hard to attribute all the expression of the lyp isoforms to the presence of lymphocytes in lung and fat considering the level of expression. further immunohistochemical study is required to clarify the expression lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> in non-lymphocytes. nonetheless, it is clear from our data that lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> are not expressed in major non-lymphoid tissues such as brain, heart, liver, and muscle. lyp <dig> appears to be the major form in most of the lymphoid tissues, and the ratios between lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> vary in different tissues. interestingly, however, the retina only expresses lyp <dig>  it is also worth noting that lyp <dig> is not present in the lung. overall, our data generally support the notion that lyp <dig> and lyp <dig> are expressed in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues. we also synthesized pcr primers to amplify specifically the reported lyp <dig> isoform. lyp <dig> was initially cloned from a human thymocyte library  <cit> . it contains a shorter c terminus due to the presence of an earlier termination codon in exon  <dig> . however, no further follow up work was done. our data indicate that lyp <dig> indeed exists, but only at very low levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes, thymus, and interestingly in prostate .

dna sequence variations play a fundamental role in human phenotypic variability, including susceptibility to diseases. snps represent the most extensively studied sequence variations. non-synonymous snps change the amino acid sequence and presumably alter protein functions. the c1858t snp that leads to the r620w substitution in lyp is a typical example. on the other hand, alternative splicing of mrna may generate protein isoforms of different sizes with different biological properties such as protein/protein interaction, subcellular localization, and catalytic activity  <cit> . we believe that this should be the case for lyp <dig> and lyp <dig>  to ensure correct cellular functions, gene expression is finely regulated both spatially and temporally, and the importance of aberrant rna processing in diseases has been generally recognized. pre-mrna splicing is a tightly regulated process affected by many factors including snps  <cit> . in this regard, it should not be a surprise if the c1858t snp affects expression of alternative spliced forms of lyp. the c1858t snp is present mainly in caucasian populations and is essentially absent in african and asian populations  <cit> . it is not known if other dna variations in lyp affect autoimmune diseases in the latter populations which have no fewer incidences of these diseases. our data indicate that the relative ratios of lyp isoforms vary among different individuals. it will be important to find if aberrant expression of lyp isoforms cause any human diseases, particularly autoimmune diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, extensive literatures exist to support the association between lyp and multiple autoimmune diseases. however, the underlying molecular mechanism is still elusive. we have now identified a novel isoform of lyp designated as lyp <dig>  this allows us to look at the problem from a new angle.
