BACKGROUND
among domesticated species, the horse represents the last one of major importance to become domesticated. the domestication of the horse had a lasting impact on human societies, by increasing mobility and trade, influencing human lifestyles and profoundly changing warfare. in turn, artificial selection by humans shaped the genetic diversity in horse populations, resulting in the variation observed in modern horse phenotypes and breeds. several studies have investigated the genetic relationship among horse breeds using mitochondrial sequences as a marker  <cit>  . most of the studies published so far used short, but highly variable fragments from the mitochondrial hypervariable region . based on a  <dig> base pair  fragment of the mtdna control region from  <dig> domestic horses, vil√† et al  <cit>  suggested the existence of at least six divergent sequence clades. in another study on a  <dig> bp fragment of the hypervariable region from a worldwide sample of  <dig> horses, up to  <dig> major haplogroups were identified in a phylogenetic network  <cit> . in the latter study, several of these haplogroups were associated with breeds and/or geographical areas . a number of additional studies extended the picture of horse mtdna diversity and distribution by including additional breeds from asia   <cit>  and it was proposed that there is evidence of a weak phylogeographic pattern  <cit> .

however, it is notable that all previous mitochondrial studies had little to no statistical support for their inferred phylogenetic trees, with most of the nodes remaining unresolved. the short sequence length and small evolutionary distance between horse breeds results in a low number of phylogenetically informative sites, and this has so far prevented high statistical support for most of the nodes within the mtdna phylogenetic tree of the domestic horse. the introduction and continued development of next generation sequencing  now allows the acquisition of much larger sequence data sets in shorter time and at lower costs compared to what was possible using classical sanger sequencing. for mitochondrial dna, sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome has been shown to improve phylogenetic resolution for the marker both between and within species  <cit> . the phylogenetic relationships of different groups of cave bears  <cit>  as well as of killer whales  <cit>  were in fact only resolved by sequencing complete mtdna genomes.

while these studies used pcr to enrich for mtdna sequencing, we have used a novel approach in which barcoded sequencing libraries from multiple samples are pooled  <cit>  and the mtdna genomes are enriched by hybridization capture on a micro array  <cit>  and sequenced on an illumina  gaii sequencing machine  <cit> .

RESULTS
sequence data analysis and alignment
we sequenced  <dig> horse samples from  <dig> breeds and a przewalski horse  using an illumina/solexa ga ii system after enriching for complete mitochondrial genomes by multiplex micro-array capture. on average,  <dig>  sequence reads per sample mapped to the mtdna genome . the minimum number of reads per sample was  <dig>  , while the maximum number was  <dig>  . the average sequence coverage per position after duplicate removal was on average 53-fold coverage and ranged from 14-fold for vjatka horse to 82-fold for clydesdale, respectively .

a consensus sequence for each of the samples was called based on the criteria described in the methods section. positions not fulfilling these criteria were called as 'n' . the maximum number of missing positions was observed for the english thoroughbred , which are  <dig> % of the investigated mtdna-genome positions. all consensus sequences were submitted to ncbi genbank . the  <dig> consensus sequences, six modern horse sequences from genbank and a full mtdna genome sequence for the donkey  were aligned using clustalw  <cit> . thirteen positions  that show a missing base call in at least three samples were removed from the alignment.

preliminary phylogenetic analysis showed that three of the genbank-derived sequences  exhibited unusually long branches, and strong departure from the clocklike evolution of the rest of sequences . the same pattern was observed on several different mrbayes runs, as well as maximum likelihood runs with phyml and raxml. this behavior might indicate contamination of these sequences by nuclear copies of the mtdna , or some other problem with these sequences. therefore, they were eliminated from the alignment and excluded from the remainder of the analysis.

the final alignment used for phylogenetic analysis consisted of  <dig> sequences and  <dig>  nucleotide positions, of which  <dig> were variable and  <dig> were parsimony-informative within horses. each of the sequences represents a unique haplotype.

phylogenetic analysis
summaries of maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood  and bayesian phylogenetic analyses are available in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  in general, good resolution was achieved, with many nodes resolved with high bootstrap and bremer support even with strict consensus trees; however, some of the very closely related mtdna lineages were not resolved .

in most of the cases when two or more individuals were sequenced from the same breed , their mtdna sequences fall on widely-spaced tips of the tree. the only exception to this observation consists of three welsh pony sequences which form a clade, although even here a fourth welsh pony sequence  falls outside this clade. these results represent strong evidence that many breeds do not have a single maternal origin and that they retain much of the ancestral mtdna variation originally found in the wild, pre-domestication populations spread across eurasia  <cit> .

divergence times
tests of the hypothesis of a strict, global molecular clock using likelihood ratio tests  either rejected the clock at p <  <dig>  but at barely significant p-values , or failed to reject the clock . as tests of a strict clock often reject the hypothesis even when there is clocklike behavior and as, given the low sequence divergence, the young age of the horse clade, and the closely-clocklike appearance of phylogenetic trees displaying un-calibrated molecular branch-lengths, clocklike behavior is likely in this situation, the decision was made to accept the molecular clock hypothesis for the purposes of further analysis.

r8s analysis using the langley-fitch method  yielded a maximum divergence time for the mtdnas of the horse breeds of  <dig>  years and minimum time of  <dig>  years. beast, using a normally-distributed prior on the horse/ass divergence time, estimated  <dig>  with a 95% credibility interval of  <dig> - <dig>  years and a substitution rate of  <dig> - <dig> substitutions/site/mya . the tree with the mean ages  and the 95% credibility intervals  is shown in figure  <dig> 

demographic history
in order to investigate changes in maternal population size through time a bayesian analysis using the bayesian skyline model  <cit>  was carried out. the bayes factor  computed via importance sampling  <cit>  with tracer  <cit>  favoured the bsp model over the constant size model . the bsp  indicates a constant population size until ~  <dig>  years bp  followed by a continued population expansion until the present and a current maternal effective population size of ~ <dig> .

discussion
in many domesticated animal species, the analysis of mtdna has for a long time suffered from limited phylogenetic resolution offered by the short mtdna fragments used. this issue is particularly severe in horses, which display one of the highest amounts of mtdna diversity for any domesticated animal. recently, the analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes in dogs  <cit>  and cattle  <cit>  has revived the use of mtdna in studying domestication. these studies showed that the use of complete mtdna genomes improved not only phylogenetic resolution but also resulted in more precise dates for the divergence of the different maternal lineages, and have improved our understanding of the geographical origins of both dogs and cattle, although the geographical origin of dogs inferred from the mitochondrial data has been challenged based on analyses of autosomal nuclear dna data  <cit> .

an increased phylogenetic resolution could therefore potentially also result in a better phylogeographical or breed specific resolution of horse mtdna sequences. however, this is not the case. although we have only a small number of breeds with at least two sampled individuals and any conclusion about the intra-breed variation based on our data is therefore inherently limited, their respective sequences are generally spread across the tree with no evidence that mtdna sequences from the same breed are more closely related than what would be expected by chance. this indicates that mitochondrial dna alone is unlikely to resolve the geographical origin of horse domestication. given the relatively recent origin of modern horse breeds and the extensive trade of horses as well as their use as a means of long-distance transport, this result is, however, not entirely surprising. resolving the timing and geographical origin of horse domestication will therefore require the use of alternative genetic markers such as autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphism provided by the horse genome sequencing project  <cit>  or phenotypic markers such as coat colour polymorphisms  <cit>  in conjunction with further archaeological studies.

the investigation of the population size through time using the bayesian skyline model shows a clear and continued increase in female population size beginning ~ <dig> ky ago, while before this time, population size was constant for tens of thousands of years. since the climate was relatively stable over the holocene compared to the glacial period, it seems a reasonable null hypothesis would be that a wild population would be approximately stable during the holocene. horse fossil records from the early holocene are rare in europe, but become more frequent in the late atlantic period   <cit> , indicating a population expansion of wild horse population at least in europe during this period. a similar pattern of a recent expansion in population size was also observed in three domestic bovine species, but not in a single wild bovine species  investigated for comparison  <cit> . the similarity in these patterns suggests that the observed steep, recent expansion in horse population size probably indicates the beginning of horse domestication. since their population size stayed constant for a long time before, despite various climatic fluctuations, the most parsimonious explanation is that domestication was causal for this population increase. this interpretation is supported by the fact that the estimated beginning of expansion  closely coincides with the beginning of horse domestication  <dig>  to  <dig>  kya as estimated in previous studies  <cit> .

divergence time estimates based on our complete mtdna sequence data suggest a rather recent ancestor for modern female horse lineages. both methods used gave similar results with  <dig> - <dig>  years  and  <dig> - <dig>  years . these estimates are considerably younger than, and did in fact not overlap at all with, the estimates based on fragments of the mitochondrial d-loop, which range from  <dig> - <dig>  years  <cit>  to  <dig> ,000- <dig>  years  <cit> , respectively. this result is not entirely surprising as overestimates of the divergence time especially in domestic animals was proposed previously  <cit> . the fast evolving d-loop is prone to multiple substitutions, especially when the calibration point used for estimates of divergence events relies on a comparatively distantly related species, thereby inflating substitution rate estimates. including the conserved regions of the mtdna genome should improve these estimates and therefore give more reliable divergence time estimates.

although a phylogenetic tree alone does not allow drawing conclusions about the number of mtdna lineages incorporated into the domestic gene pool, the molecular dates obtained for the divergence events in combination with knowledge about the timing of horse domestication allow some speculations on this issue. if one uses a relatively recent estimate for horse domestication of about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> , our data suggest that at least  <dig> mtdna lineages and therefore at least as many wild mares, contributed to the domestic gene pool. given that we only sequenced  <dig> horses, this is a remarkable high number. if horse domestication took place  <dig>  years ago , the number of domesticated mtdna lineages reduces, but still remains at a comparatively high number of  <dig>  if the point estimate for the divergence dates is used. jansen et al.  <cit>  suggested the incorporation of at least  <dig> mares into the domestic gene pool. however, their numbers are not directly comparable to our results and should rather be seen as rough estimates. although the conclusion of jansen et al is based on a much larger sample set, the short length of only  <dig> bp and the high mutation rate in the d-loop might inflate the calculations. given that we used  <dig> horses  in our analyses, our numbers are minimum estimates and screening more modern horses would undoubtedly reveal further domesticated lineages. this is especially true, as several deeply branching lineages in our tree are represented by only a single individual. therefore it is likely that additional samples would reveal at least some additional mtdna lineage divergences that predate horse domestication. thus, when applied to an extensive sampling of horses worldwide this approach promises to yield for the first time an informed estimate about the number of mares that were incorporated into the domestic gene pool.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides a window into the maternal origins of extant domestic horses and confirms that modern domestic breeds present a wide sample of the mtdna diversity found in ancestral, now extinct, wild horse populations. the data obtained allow us to detect a population expansion event coinciding with the beginning of domestication and to estimate both the minimum number of female horses incorporated into the domestic gene pool and the time depth of the domestic horse mtdna gene pool.
