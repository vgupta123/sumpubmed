BACKGROUND
the number of arctic charr  phenotypes varies considerably within and across localities on disko island off the west coast of greenland  <cit> . two landlocked populations have been described here as well as dimorphic populations with an anadromous morph and a resident morph in rivers  <cit> , but whether the two morphs are reproductively isolated remain unclear. the resident and landlocked populations are isolated in the same locality throughout their entire life cycle, thereby presenting an excellent opportunity to investigate differential effects of abiotic factors on somatic growth.

fish are ectotherms and hence rely exclusively on external sources of heat. metabolic produced heat is rapidly lost through the gills and the epidermis and consequently body temperature fluctuates closely with changes in the ambient water temperature  <cit> . indeed, since the metabolic processes within the animals are strongly temperature dependent  <cit> , ambient water temperature exerts a major influence on all physiological and behavioural processes in the fish. moreover, temperature has a non-linear effect on physiological responses, with an identifiable optimum-rate, and it has been argued that the thermal niche of a fish should considered in much the same way as for example a food resource  <cit> . also, it has been shown that that ovulation in charr markedly decreases above 8°c and is inhibited at 10°c  <cit> . finally, maintaining fish above 5°c for several weeks results in reduced quality of the eggs  <cit> . hence, relatively small absolute changes in ambient temperature may induce profound changes in the life history traits of the arctic charr.

major changes in climate have already been observed in the arctic and climate models predict further amplification of the enhanced greenhouse effect at high-latitudes leading to increased warming  <cit> . in the present study, we propose that warming in the arctic may affect the annual growth conditions of the cold adapted arctic charr and that such effects can already be detected retrospectrally using otolith data. to evaluate this hypothesis in  <dig> we sampled fish and otoliths from populations at several localities at disko island, where the local climate shows an increasing trend in temperatures in the period  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . finally, we compare the age specific growth in  <dig> with age specific growth data sampled in  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
description of the two homogenous and landlocked populations
the investigations of population structure using principal component analysis  showed that only one morph inhabited the landlocked localities røde elv  and kangarssuk  . therefore, only individuals sampled from these two populations were used in the analysis. all individuals from both localities had parr marks characteristic of fish that have not smoltificated. the individuals from røde elv were small, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> mm, and had large eyes and ventrally placed mouths. despite their small size, a number of fish in røde elv were ready to spawn, a feature common to both populations. specific for all fish sampled at kangarssuk were large external, infectious wounds. fish in kangarssuk were large, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> mm and a considerable number were ready to spawn. all individuals caught at kangarssuk were more than  <dig> years old, while ages of individuals in other populations were uniformly distributed. all had eaten chironomids and additionally a large number of individuals had preyed on benthic ostracods and lepidurus arcticus.

annual fish growth rate and effects of climate variation
detailed results from multiple linear regressions are depicted in table  <dig>  regressions were carried out with growth rate residuals  as response variable and one year delayed autoregressing , mean annual temperature , mean summer temperature , mean winter temperature  and mean annual precipitation  as predictor variables. none of the four weather parameters showed significant interdependence. analyses of cohorts caught in  <dig> were based on weather data from qeqertarsuaq, while analyses from  <dig> cohorts were carried out using data from aasiaat.

analyses of the røde elv individuals caught in  <dig>  showed a negative effect of ta on the annual grt together with a non-significant grt- <dig> . the otolith data from this sample allow regression with more than two predictor variables in only two cases but neither yielded any significant results . otolith data from individuals caught in røde elv in  <dig>  by contrast, allowed simultaneous modelling of several predictor variables and grt. these data showed a significant positive relationship with ta and a significant negative relationship with pa.

data on annual grt from the kangarssuk individuals caught in  <dig>  allowed simultaneous multiple linear regression with several predictor variables and the analysis yielded several significant relationships between grt and ts and tw, respectively . for example, multiple linear regression with grt and the predictor values ts, ta and grt- <dig> showed a positive significant connection , while a similar regressing with grt and the predictor variables tw, ta and grt- <dig> showed a negative significant relationship . thus, grt are significantly related negatively to tw and positively to ts, without any significant grt- <dig> 

data on annual grt from individuals caught in kangarssuk in  <dig>  allowed multiple linear regressions incorporating several predictor variables. a model incorporating ta, pa and grt- <dig> showed a negative effect of pa on grt , while a model incorporating tw instead of ta further documented the relationship .

comparison of mean growth rate from the two time series
otolith derived changes in mean values of fork length estimated means , and thereby growth, were assessed from the periods 1982– <dig> and 1995– <dig>  respectively. an anova test was performed to evaluate the differences between the time series. the estimated rates of growth from the røde elv samples from 1982– <dig> were significantly larger compared with the 1995– <dig> sample . the opposite was the case among fish from kangarssuk. here, rates of growth were larger in the period 1991– <dig> compared to 1982– <dig> .

discussion
our findings suggest that the climatic variation observed in the arctic during the last two decades has already had a significant effect on life history parameters in arctic charr. this is evident from the complex coupling between annual growth rates and fluctuations in mean annual temperatures and means annual precipitation together with marked changes in the annual mean growth rate history between  <dig> and  <dig>  impacts of climate on animal populations have been demonstrated before for several species in the arctic e.g. musk oxen, reindeer, vole and wolf  <cit> . these species are generally morphologically and ecologically more uniform than arctic charr which is one of the most polymorphic vertebrate species  <cit> . consequently, several difficulties would be anticipated addressing the modelling analyses without consideration for known variation in life history and hence somatic growth rates for different morphs – e.g. anadromous versus residents. the homogenous and landlocked arctic charr in røde elv and kangarssuk were therefore the only suitable populations to study annual climatic impact on growth of an arctic population. the mean air temperatures in august at sample sites have increased from  <dig> °c in  <dig> to  <dig> °c in  <dig>  <cit> . consistent with our prediction this appears to have retarded the rate of growth of fish in one population  but, contrary to our expectations to have stimulated annual rates of growth in another . we suggest that the difference in response might be due to local differences in the dynamic between energy demand in fish and food supply.

an increase in ambient temperature leads to increase in metabolic rate, which in turn leads to an increased energy demand. if increased metabolic demand is not matched by a corresponding increase in food supply, the net outcome is likely to be a reduction in fitness and, hence, growth rate of the fish  <cit> . røde elv already is a poor habitat for charr, as indicated by the small maximum size of fish there , and higher temperatures may therefore have resulted in an increased metabolic demand which the fish were unable to adequately meet. at kangarssuk, in contrast, there appear to have been an increase in food supply evidenced by the appearance of benthic ostracods and lepidurus arcticus as new food items in  <dig> compared to prior sampling at the locality  <cit> .

after showing climate dependent growth rates in fish caught in both  <dig> and  <dig>  the time series were compared. the data demonstrated a difference between fem from the  <dig> and  <dig> time series at both røde elv and kangarssuk. the charr population in røde elv in  <dig> had experienced a decline in fem compared to  <dig>  as mentioned, several factors such as elevated temperatures, increased turbidity or difference in prey composition may explain this tendency. the definition of optimum temperature for growth is only valid under the assumption that there is no food limitation  <cit> . hence, the temperature at which the growth rate is maximised is progressively shifted to lower temperature values, as the amount of available food is decreased  <cit> . our data from røde elv is in accordance with the above mentioned scenario showing a significant positive influence of ta on the population sampled in  <dig>  while samples from  <dig> show a significant negative influence of ta on the annual growths rate. thus, changes in fem between  <dig> and  <dig> supports our hypothesis that in røde elv energy resources cannot sustain higher metabolic rates created by increasing temperatures. consequently, there has been a drop in fitness mirrored in the reduced growth rate.

from the kangarssuk data it is evident that fem values are considerably larger in the  <dig> compared to  <dig>  furthermore, all individuals caught in kangarssuk in  <dig> had large skin infections, which were not observed in  <dig>  <cit> . several studies have shown that parasitic, viral and bacterial infections in fish are positively correlated to ambient temperatures  <cit> . it seems therefore reasonable that the infections could be a consequence of the increase temperature in the lake. in addition, we did not catch any juvenile individuals in kangarssuk, which is also contrary to studies in  <dig>  <cit>  and the other sampled localities. the fact that it was impossible to catch fish below age 5+ suggests that the population have limited breeding success possibly caused by the elevated temperatures in the shallow lake .

CONCLUSIONS
results from the present study show that temperature has a notable impact on the growth rates of two cold adapted arctic charr populations. the populations investigated have been affected in different ways. thus, our results show that the effect of warming on arctic charr growth, depend on the magnitude of change and on local factors such as the morphometry of the system in question , pathogens and food resources. even though that this study is based on two localities with a limited sample size, the results are significant and indicate that the current increase in temperature is already having an impact on the arctic populations.
