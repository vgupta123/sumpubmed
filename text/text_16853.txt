BACKGROUND
human milk contains numerous proteins with properties beyond nutritional function
 <cit> . caseins are a main protein constituent of human milk and casein fragments exert a number of biological effects including the modulation of leukocyte adhesion
 <cit> , chemotactic properties
 <cit> , and inhibition of cell growth
 <cit>  for instance. more recently, a member of the casein family, casein alpha s <dig> , was shown to be expressed outside the mammary gland: overexpression was noted in lymph nodes of encephalomyelitic mice and blood of multiple sclerosis patients
 <cit> . furthermore, independent studies reported overexpression of csn1s <dig> in synovial tissue of patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
 <cit> . consequently, a potential function of csn1s <dig> was further characterized by the finding of proinflammatory effects on monocytic cells, like for instance increased expression of il-1β
 <cit> . thus, the concept of csn1s <dig> as a multifunctional protein with both nutritional and immunomodulatory functions is evolving. initial events in many inflammatory conditions crucially involve macrophages
 <cit> . macrophages usually originate from monocytes that are produced in the bone marrow and reach target tissues via systemic circulation
 <cit> . in the present study, we therefore investigated the effect of csn1s <dig> on monocytes and possible effects on cellular differentiation in vitro.

methods
blood donors and monocyte isolation
cells were isolated from 40– <dig> ml peripheral blood of healthy donors, collected into edta tubes  by magnetic cell sorting with beaded cd <dig> antibodies . the number of experiments is indicated in the figure legends. donors had to be free of any medication including over-the-counter drugs, without record of any chronic illness, and currently free of any acute illness such as infections. cells were seeded out at  <dig> × 106/ml except for western blotting for extracellular signal-regulated kinase  and c-jun n-terminal kinase  experiments, cells were seeded out at  <dig> × 106/ml. the experiments were conducted with the understanding and the consent of each participant. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of heinrich-heine-university.

cell culture and stimulation experiments
monocytes were cultured in rpmi  <dig> + glutamax™ supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum,  <dig> iu/ml penicillin, and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin .  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin  was added to experiments to exclude any lps effects 
 <cit> , except for the assessment of cellular morphology of living cells, where  <dig> ng/ml lps was added in a control experiment. recombinant human casein alpha s <dig>   was added to cultured cells in indicated concentrations for  <dig> or  <dig> h. the following compounds were used to induce in vitro differentiation of monocytes as control experiments: m-csf   <dig> ng/ml, gm-csf  <dig> ng/ml, il- <dig>  <dig> ng/ml, ifnγ  <dig> ng/ml . for inhibition of casein effects,  <dig> μmol/l mouse anti human m-csf antibody  or cell permeable inhibitors were added as described
 <cit>  : briefly, p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase -inhibitor ml <dig> was used at  <dig> nm, erk 1/2-inhibitor pd <dig> was used at  <dig> μm, jnk-inhibitor  was used at  <dig> μm. viability of cells was assessed by 3--5--2--2h-tetrazolium-assay  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

phagocytosis assay
primary human monocytes were seeded out at  <dig> × 106/ml and stimulated for  <dig> h with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml px in order to exclude any lps effects. the uptake of fluorescent labelled zymosan particles was assessed with the colorimetric cytoselect phagocytosis assay  according to the manufacturer’s instructions after  <dig> and  <dig> h. as a control, cells were cultured in medium including px only.

microscopy
living cells were photographed at a scale of 400× magnification with nikon eclipse te <dig> and nikon digital camera dxm  <dig>  or cells were cultured in chamber slides , may-grünwald-giemsa stained  and photographed at a scale of  <dig> and 400× magnification with axioskop  <dig> plus  and nikon digital camerads-2mv .

flow cytometry
antibodies were purchased from bd bioscience , r&d , and biolegend . after stimulation, cells were incubated with the above antibodies at optimized concentrations. for the assessment of csn1s <dig> effects on dc differentiation, primary human monocytes were incubated with  <dig> ng/ml gm-csf or  <dig> ng/ml gm-csf plus  <dig> ng/ml il- <dig> in the absence or presence of  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig>  surface-marker expression was analyzed with facsort . depending on the mean fluorescence intensity, the expression of markers is defined as “low” at <  <dig> and as “high” at > 100
 <cit> .

polymerase-chain-reaction 
rna was isolated with rneasy® mini kit , and reverse transcription was performed using qantitect® reverse transcription kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pcr with real time measurement of fluorescence was carried out on the steponeplus real-time pcr system  with  <dig>  μm gene-specific, exon-spanning primers for il-1b   in triplicates using qantitect® sybr green pcr kit . results were relatively quantified using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh   as internal and reference rna  as external standard according to the –ΔΔct-method.

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
quantikine® human m-csf-, il-6- and il-1-elisa  were applied for measuring proteins in the supernatants of cell cultures according to the manufacturer‘s instructions. determinations were carried out in duplicates. absorbance was measured at  <dig> nm using the anthos  <dig> elisa reader .

western blot
western blot was carried out as described before for detection of p38
 <cit> , and jnk or erk
 <cit> . briefly, after stimulating primary human monocytes for 24h with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> total cell proteins were prepared for sds-page on a  <dig> % gel. electroblotting was carried out onto a polyvinyldifluoride membrane . membranes including the same samples were incubated with either p38-map kinase antibody  or phosphorylated p38-map kinase antibody, jnk or phosphorylated jnk antibody, and erk or phosphorylated erk antibody  at optimized concentrations over night at 4°c. after appropriate washing procedures, the membranes were incubated with a 1: <dig>  dilution of horseradish peroxidase -conjugated anti-rabbit igg . proteins were visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence  substrate  and detection by ccd camera .

data presentation
data is presented as error-bars representing mean and standard deviation, representative facs histograms, or representative photographs of microscopy slides and immunoblots. data comparison was carried out by two-sided t-test with bonferroni correction for multiple testing for comparison of surface markers after stimulation with csn1s <dig> only, or by one way anova with bonferroni correction for multiple testing in experiments with inhibitors, antibodies, or when csn1s <dig> stimulation was compared to gm-csf/il <dig> or m-csf/ifnγ stimulation. p < . <dig> was considered significant.

RESULTS
csn1s <dig> alters the morphology of monocytes
after incubation of primary human monocytes with recombinant csn1s <dig>  changes in cellular morphology were noted. living cells became adherent to the cell culture dish when incubated for  <dig> h with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> and the development of pseudopodia was noted in some of the cells when stimulated with higher concentrations . these effects were not observed in the control cultures without csn1s <dig>  or in case lower concentrations of csn1s <dig>  were used . for comparison, primary human monocytes were incubated with up to  <dig> ng/ml lps, which had no visible effect on cellular morphology .

for a better characterization of cellular morphology, primary cells were cultured in chamber slides and stained. morphology of living cells suggested a differentiation towards dc or macrophages. thus, we included primary cells stimulated with gm-csf or gm-csf/il <dig>  and m-csf or m-csf/ifnγ for comparison to csn1s <dig>  as the latter stimulants are known to mediate in vitro differentiation towards the respective cell types
 <cit> . although we observed rapid morphologic changes in csn1s <dig> stimulated cells, in vitro differentiation of monocytes is commonly carried out over  <dig> days. thus, cells were incubated with the stimulants for both,  <dig> h and  <dig> h. as can be seen in figure 
 <dig>  after  <dig> h, control cells were round with little cytoplasm. in contrast, gm-csf and gm-csf/il- <dig> induced enlarged cytoplasm. m-csf stimulated cells displayed a smaller increase in cytoplasm with respect to cells stimulated with gm-csf or gm-csf/il <dig>  moreover, m-csf, and especially m-csf/ifnγ treated cells displayed pseudopodia, which were absent in control cells or cells treated with either gm-csf or gm-csf/il <dig>  furthermore, cells stimulated with m-csf/ifnγ formed small aggregates. these modifications observed in m-csf or m-csf/ifnγ stimulated cells were similar to changes observed in cells stimulated with csn1s <dig>  which formed aggregates and developed pseudopodia. after  <dig> h, many control cells became adherent and showed a greatly enlarged cytoplasm. this was also observed for gm-csf and gm-csf/il- <dig> treated cells. stimulation with m-csf caused the development of pseudopodia besides the occurrence of adherent cells with enlarged cytoplasm. the addition of ifnγ to m-csf again led to a strong tendency towards cellular aggregation and the development of pseudopodia. this was also true for cells incubated with csn1s <dig> 

csn1s <dig> alters cell-surface marker expression
the cellular morphology of csn1s <dig> stimulated cells suggested a differentiation, either into macrophages or into dc. besides morphological changes, differentiated cells of each type can be distinguished by distinct surface marker expression
 <cit> . therefore, primary human monocytes were incubated for  <dig> or  <dig> h with recombinant csn1s <dig> and expression of representative surface markers for differentiation of monocytes towards macrophages or dc were analyzed by flow cytometry after immunolabeling. after  <dig> h stimulation with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig>  upregulations of cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  were detectable . lower concentrations of csn1s <dig> had no effect . the pattern of surface markers obtained was characteristic for macrophages rather than for dc 
 <cit> . after  <dig> h of incubation with csn1s <dig>  cd <dig> but not cd <dig> remained significantly upregulated. the pattern of surface markers remained the same  . next, we compared the surface markers of monocytes differentiated with csn1s <dig> to in vitro differentiated monocytes towards macrophages  or dc . such differentiation is known to be obtained by stimulation of primary human monocytes for  <dig> h
 <cit> . as can be seen in figure 
3c, no difference in surface marker expression was observed after  <dig> h. in contrast, after  <dig> h, csn1s <dig> and m-csf/ifnγ stimulation resulted in the same phenotype , while gm-csf/il- <dig> caused a significant downregulation of cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression with upregulation of cd1a.

csn1s <dig> increases phagocytic activity of monocytes
next, we assessed if incubation of primary human monocytes with csn1s <dig> also results in functional changes. increased phagocytic activity is a characteristic property of monocytes differentiated towards a macrophage-like phenotype
 <cit> . therefore, the intracellular uptake of labelled zymosan particles into primary human monocytes was assessed in a colorimetric assay after incubation with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> for  <dig> h. there was a marked increase in phagocytic activity of cells after  <dig> h , which was sustained after  <dig> h .

influence of csn1s <dig> on gm-csf- and gm-csf/il-4-induced dc differentiation
the above data suggested that csn1s <dig> skews cellular differentiation of monocytes towards a macrophage-like phenotype. we were therefore interested, if an alternative route of differentiation, i.e. early differentiation of monocytes into dc, could be antagonized by the addition of  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> for  <dig> h. for this purpose, primary human monocytes were incubated with gm-csf for  <dig> h in the presence or absence of csn1s <dig> and the expression of cell surface markers was assessed by flow cytometry. as can be seen in figure 
4b, gm-csf alone induced a characteristic immature dc cell surface marker pattern 
 <cit> . the addition of csn1s <dig> abolished gm-csf effects and lead to a macrophage pattern . besides gm-csf, the combination of gm-csf and il- <dig> is a strong stimulus for in vitro dc generation
 <cit> . therefore, we additionally examined the properties of csn1s <dig> in influencing gm-csf/il-4-induced dc differentiation. gm-csf/il- <dig> similarly caused characteristic immature dc cell surface marker expression  after  <dig> h of incubation, and this effect could not be inhibited by the addition of csn1s <dig> .

the role of m-csf in csn1s1-mediated cellular differentiation
we previously reported that monocytic cells secrete gm-csf in response to csn1s1
 <cit> . gm-csf is known to influence the differentiation of monocytes towards a dc phenotype
 <cit> . according to the present results, autocrine stimulation with csn1s <dig> induced gm-csf must therefore be overcome by alternative stimuli to allow for a differentiation towards the observed macrophage-like phenotype. we speculated that autocrine stimulation with m-csf secreted upon csn1s <dig> induction, upregulation of the m-csf receptor cd <dig>  or downregulation of the gm-csf receptor cd <dig> could be responsible for the observed effects. first, primary human monocytes were stimulated with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> for  <dig> h and m-csf secretion into supernatants was quantified by elisa. as can be seen in figure 
4c, csn1s <dig> increased the secretion of m-csf into culture supernatants 29-fold. as a control, an m-csf antibody was added to the experiments in order to demonstrate its capacity to bind all secreted m-csf after stimulation . in the next step, differentiation of primary human monocytes was induced by  <dig> h incubation with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> and the expression of cd <dig> and the m-csf and gm-csf receptors  were determined by flow cytometry and immunolabeling . csn1s <dig> lead to the expected upregulation of cd <dig>  while the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> remained unchanged. the addition of an m-csf antibody to csn1s <dig> stimulated primary human monocytes in the same concentration that was demonstrated to bind the secreted m-csf protein  did not alter the expression of cd <dig> or the receptors cd <dig> and cd <dig>  thus, neither changes in the expression of m-csf, nor up- or downregulation of m-csf receptor  or gm-csf receptor  respectively, explained the preferential shift of monocyte differentiation towards macrophages in culture conditions that contain both m- and gm-csf.

csn1s <dig> induced differentiation and cytokine expression may partially be mediated via mapk
we previously reported that csn1s <dig> upregulates the expression and secretion of gm-csf in monocytes in a p <dig> mapk-dependent fashion
 <cit> . we were therefore interested to analyze if cellular differentiation and the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines is also dependent upon mapk pathways. in a first step, we analysed if addition of inhibitors of the mapk pathways, i.e. jnk, p <dig>  and erk, influenced overall survival of primary human monocytes. as can be seen in figure 
5a, there was no significant effect on cellular vitality of monocytes by addition of inhibitors for  <dig> h in the concentrations used in subsequent experiments. next, we assessed if the addition of these inhibitors was biologically effective in suppressing mapk mediated signalling. lps-signalling is known to be mediated via all three mapk: jnk, p <dig>  and erk, and results in il-1b expression
 <cit> . therefore, primary human monocytes were stimulated with lps for  <dig> h in the presence and absence of mapk inhibitors and il-1b-mrna expression was measured as a control experiment. as can be seen in figure 
5b, all inhibitors significantly suppressed il-1b-mrna expression to a similar degree. in order to identify a putative signal transduction mechanism responsible for csn1s1-induced cellular differentiation, we then tested the ability of mapk inhibitors to impede the generation of a macrophage-like phenotype. primary human monocytes were therefore incubated with mapk inhibitors before stimulation with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig>  cell surface markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  upregulated during csn1s1-induced differentiation as described above, were assessed by flow cytometry and immunolabeling. as depicted in figure 
5c, csn1s1-mediated upregulation of cd <dig> was significantly decreased by inhibition of erk, but not p <dig> and jnk. next, we were interested to see if this effect was specific for csn1s <dig> stimulated cells or if erk-inhibition generally reduces cd <dig> expression in monocytes treated with m-csf or gm-csf. to this end, cells were treated with mapk inhibitors prior to stimulation with m-csf. as shown in figure 
5d, upregulations of cd <dig> in m-csf treated cells were not influenced by inhibition of erk as in csn1s <dig> treated cells, but by inhibition of jnk. in contrast, mapk inhibition did not influence surface marker expression in cells stimulated with gm-csf for  <dig> h . this suggests that signal transduction of csn1s1-mediated differentiation is at least in part distinct from pathways used by m-csf.

in order to evaluate whether csn1s <dig> induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines via the same route, primary human monocytes were stimulated with csn1s <dig> and il-1b and il- <dig> protein-secretion into culture supernatants was measured in the presence and absence of mapk inhibitors. as can be seen in figure 
5f-g, a significant reduction in the upregulation of il-1b was noted with inhibition of p <dig> and jnk while il- <dig> was decreased with inhibition of jnk only. of note, inhibition of erk did not reduce increased cytokine secretion in a significant manner.

the above results suggested that csn1s <dig> engages all  <dig> mapk molecules to either exert effects on cellular differentiation or proinflammatory cytokine expression. to confirm this notion, we additionally assessed activation, i.e. phosphorylation, of mapk after incubation of primary human monocytes with  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig> for  <dig> h by western blot. as can be seen in figure 
5h, p <dig>  jnk, and erk were all phosphorylated when stimulated with csn1s <dig>  but not in control experiments without csn1s <dig> 

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrate that exposure of primary human monocytes to csn1s <dig> in vitro consistently skews cellular differentiation towards macrophages, including morphological changes, distinct surface marker expression, and functional properties such as increased phagocytic activity. additionally, csn1s <dig> induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
 <cit> . besides these functions, the most obvious role of human csn1s <dig> is to provide an amino acid source to the new-born. however, the acquisition of additional functionality in an evolutionary context is an increasingly recognized phenomenon, also referred to as protein promiscuity
 <cit> . in accordance with this notion, caseins are considered to have arisen from innate immune genes, and that their nutritive functions are a consequence of a more recent evolutionary development
 <cit> . this assumption is based on the conserved organization of the casein genes in a cluster of innate immune genes that also includes the histatin/statherin-family
 <cit> . the hypothesis that csn1s <dig> is a multifunctional protein is further supported by its state as a disordered protein with multiple potential tertiary conformations
 <cit> . this last point has to be regarded with caution however, since – to the best of our knowledge – crystallographic analyses of the human csn1s <dig> structures currently do not exist. since csn1s <dig> is not only an endogenous produced protein, but is also a component of milk, the question arises, which potential functions csn1s1-induced il-1β expression could have in the offspring. intestinal exposure to antigens and milk constitutes an important trigger for the development of a competent immune system in the new-born
 <cit> . it is therefore interesting to speculate that csn1s <dig> in mother milk may contribute to the development of a patent immune system by triggering immune responses to potential pathogens by activation of innate immune responses like for instance il-1β secretion. moreover, csn1s <dig> by itself gives rise to sustained specific igg antibody production in nursed individuals
 <cit> . early infantile autoantibody production in turn is speculated to confer protection to pathogens
 <cit> . on the other hand, there are several mechanisms which could potentially prevent overwhelming inflammation triggered by exposure to csn1s <dig> in milk: csn1s <dig> is only a minor component of human milk and constitutes approximately 5% of the casein-fraction
 <cit> . moreover, csn1s <dig> may be degraded by proteases in the healthy gut, thereby preventing il-1β induction. further research is clearly warranted to clarify these exciting new hypotheses and to explore, if variations in csn1s <dig> exposure or extra-mammary expression may contribute to defective immune reactions. the recent findings of csn1s <dig> overexpression in the autoimmune diseases multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis
 <cit>  may be considered supportive of this hypothesis.

in the present experiments, the effect on all aspects of cellular differentiation, i.e. change of morphology, surface marker expression and increased phagocytosis, were observed rapidly, within  <dig> h of stimulation. furthermore, csn1s <dig> was able to reverse early gm-csf-induced monocyte differentiation into dc, resulting in a macrophage like phenotype. in vitro differentiation of monocytes towards macrophages or dc is most commonly carried out over  <dig> days, although more rapid differentiation in the course of several hours is recognized depending on the stimulus used
 <cit> . in accordance with this notion, characteristic differences between in vitro differentiation towards macrophages  or dc  were observed after  <dig>  but not  <dig> h. of note, surface markers were strikingly similar between m-csf/ifnγ and csn1s <dig> treated cells. however, csn1s <dig> failed to reverse in vitro generation of early dc by a combination of gm-csf and il- <dig>  this may be due to the more potent effect on in vitro dc generation by the combined cytokines compared to gm-csf alone
 <cit> .

we were consequently interested to explore potential mechanisms employed by csn1s <dig> to induce monocyte differentiation and cytokine expression. it was previously reported that primary human monocytes secrete gm-csf in response to csn1s1
 <cit> . this was somewhat puzzling, because gm-csf is known to influence the differentiation of monocytes towards a dc phenotype
 <cit> . on the other hand, according to the present data, csn1s <dig> does also increase the secretion of m-csf into culture supernatants. however, addition of a neutralizing m-csf antibody to stimulated monocytes did not abrogate csn1s1-effects. importantly, there were also no changes in expression of the gm-csf- or m-csf-receptors . thus, csn1s <dig> likely induces its effects on monocyte differentiation by a mechanism independent from m-csf signalling. concerning intracellular messengers, csn1s <dig>  like other proinflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig> for example, employs p <dig> mapk to induce proinflammatory cytokine expression
 <cit> . inhibition of another member of the mapk family, erk1/ <dig>  a well-known regulator of cellular differentiation
 <cit> , but not p <dig> or jnk led to a decrease in csn1s <dig> induced upregulation of cd <dig> in the present experiments. this effect may be specific for csn1s <dig> rather than attributable to the process of differentiation of monocytes towards macrophages in general, because m-csf induced upregulation of cd <dig> was inhibited by jnk exclusively. furthermore, in contrast to differentiation, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines  was influenced by the inhibition of jnk and/or p <dig>  but not by erk1/ <dig>  it cannot be excluded that other second messengers are employed for csn1s <dig> induced cellular differentiation as well, especially because cd <dig> was not significantly affected by erk1/ <dig> inhibition. in conclusion, the data suggest that mapk may be differentially involved in mediating csn1s <dig> induced effects on cellular differentiation or cytokine expression. further research in this direction is warranted however, before firm conclusions can be drawn.

a limitation to the study consists in the fact that the concentration of csn1s <dig> in potentially relevant tissues for monocyte differentiation such as e.g. inflamed nerves, joints, or even the gastrointestinal tract is unknown. in order to simulate physiologic conditions, the concentrations of csn1s <dig> used in the present experiments was determined based on previous observations: while in vitro-experiments suggest that ectopic csn1s <dig> secretion by monocytes is in the range of ng/ml
 <cit> , human milk contains  <dig>  mg/ml total casein
 <cit> , approximately 5% of which is made up of csn1s1
 <cit> . this results in a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml csn1s <dig>  although proteins contained in milk are exposed to proteases within the digestive tract, they may be absorbed in an intact form which is even favoured by immature digestive functions of infants and protease inhibitors within milk
 <cit> . thus, concentrations used in the present experiments may reflect local conditions in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
human csn1s <dig> influences the differentiation of monocytes towards macrophages in vitro and mediates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. this process is at least partially dependent on differential mapk signalling. the notion of csn1s <dig> as a multifunctional protein with immunomodulatory properties beyond nutritional aspects is further evolving.
