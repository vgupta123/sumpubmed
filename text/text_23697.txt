BACKGROUND
lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world  <cit> . it is very heterogeneous and high-risk mortality genetic disease. non-small cell lung cancer  is the major type of human lung cancer. the most common histologic sub-type of nsclc is lung adenocarcinoma . ac is a long-term disease that takes  <dig> to  <dig> years to manifest. ac is characterized by dramatic gene expression changes in tumour cells and has a high chance of early metastasizing, due to the inherent molecular abnormalities of lung cancer cells and the presence of an extremely dense blood and lymph vessel network. haematogenesis and lymph dissemination can spread the cancer to other lobes of the lung, liver and brain even on the early stages of the disease. many models of ac development and progression have been discussed in the literature  <cit> . however, the genetic mechanisms of the early stages of primary lung ac progression and metastasis are poorly understood.

diagnosis and prognosis at early stages of the ac are a key factor for treatment outcome
patients with lung ac have better survival rate when the localized tumour is removed at an early stage  <cit> . however, current clinical instrumental methods for diagnostics of lung cancers , such as ct-scan, x-ray screening are still not sufficient for reliable early diagnostics of ac and prognosis of early metastasis. in contrast to breast cancer clinical biomarkers, current status of the early diagnostic, prognostic and predictive gene expression signatures in non-small-cell lung cancer have failed to establish the usefulness of the gene markers over or above known clinical risk factors  <cit> . in particular, there is currently no clinically applicable gene test for the diagnosis and prognosis at early stage of ac  <cit> .

the currently available ac gene signatures demonstrate substantial differences in both the number of predicted genes and the specific genes they include, mostly due to differences in the study design, assay platforms, tumour histology and patient selection protocols. only few of the studies in the field produced detailed clinical and research protocols that were statistically and biologically validated  <cit> . additionally, small sample size, noise and unresolved problems of massive data integration reduce the power of the test for discriminatory biological variables and clinically important predictors. divergence and poor overlap of the ac and other lung tumours gene signatures suggests that our knowledge about nature and space dimensionality of tumour-associated genes  is essentially incomplete  <cit> . all these questions are important in assessing the biological complexity of the tumours and the optimization of research and clinical study strategies  <cit> . to address them, the biological, clinical and population variations, the limited sample size and the sensitivity/specificity of the diagnostic/prognostic biomarker selection method  should be taken into account.

perspective molecular markers for diagnostics, classification and staging of ac development and ac patient’s stratification
using microarray technology, several putative gene markers of lung ac have been intensely studied and evaluated in clinical trials, for example egfr  <cit>  and osteopontin   <cit> . other prospective gene markers, such as erbb <dig>  <cit> , malat <dig>  <cit> , s100a <dig>  <cit> , s100a <dig>  <cit> , tcf <dig>  <cit> , abcc <dig>  <cit>  and eln <dig>  <cit>  have been found and validated in independent studies. for example, s100a <dig>  is suspected to have a function of tumour suppressor. therefore, it can be considered to be a promising cancer prognostic marker  <cit> . currently, currently there is no clinically applied gene test for early diagnostics, prognosis and prediction of response to lung ac therapies  <cit> .

paired independent and dependent design of clinical genomics study
the experimental design and the properties  of the feature selection method for biomarkers prediction are two important decision steps preceding the actual data analysis. their choice might significantly affect the sensitivity and specificity of the findings, given a high dimensionality of the data and the numerous error sources that affect them.

in contrast to studies based on unpaired data , paired data experiments have not been extensively applied in feature selection of transcriptome studies aiming to biomarker identification  <cit> . however, due to the heterogeneous nature of the cancer genetics it is natural to consider the use of paired measurements  originating from the same test object  <cit> . the paired microarray data analysis compares the repeated measurements within subjects, rather than across subjects, and, in our case could increase the power of the test: multivariate paired sample design study of dependent samples obtained from the same object  could reduce the cross-population and technical variability, increase the specificity in the identification of highly discriminative features, increase the sensitivity of diagnostic and prognostic biomarker selection and facilitate disease personalization.

haney et al.  <cit>  showed essential improvement in the identification of differentially expressed genes when paired designs were used compared to independent sample designs. no tests were performed to determine the benefit of using different statistical procedures for paired dependent designed microarray datasets. the performance of various statistical or computational simulation methods on pair-designed microarray datasets was not sufficiently evaluated  <cit> . interestingly, a huge improvement has been observed in dna copy number variation  analysis when paired dependent design was used; more reliable and larger fraction of copy number variations at the genome scale were detected compared to non-paired controls  <cit> . ideally, cnv analysis of normal tissue samples processed simultaneously with the tumour specimens would eliminate technical noise variability and batch effects  <cit> . additional advantages of paired comparisons include the suppression of copy number aberrations present in both normal and tumour tissues  <cit> . till recently, paired tissue samples were rarely available and acquisition of paired normal tissue did not typically fall within the purview of therapeutic surgical intervention. consequently, normal cnv profiles are often derived from a variety of normal specimens accumulated in a laboratory or rely on data obtained from other laboratories employing the same cnv platform and/or comparison with a publicly accessible database. heinrichs et al  <cit>  used myeloid malignant samples to demonstrate the superiority of matched tumour and normal dna samples  over multiple unpaired samples with respect to reducing false discovery rates in high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis. the advantages of paired design in cnv analysis was also suggested by wu et al  <cit> . in view of the above, we propose a new statistical procedure to identify highly-discriminative genes from microarray paired dependent studies.

we suggest that analysis of gene expression data of the primary pt-at handled with a rational computational strategy of biomarker prediction essentially facilitates personalized identification of a comprehensive set of specific ac signatures, disease-specific pathways and clinical biomarkers.

within this framework, the primary aim of this work was to design a feature selection  method that is capable not only of identifying conventional ‘differentially expressed genes’  <cit> , but also of predicting new genes that are biologically meaningful and more clinically useful. the secondary aim was to use new methodology to identify important diagnostic and prognostic lung ac biomarkers. we achieved these aims by  cross-normalization of the initial dataset,  selection of highly-discriminative gene sets using non-parametric tests,  automatic clustering of selected genes into biologically meaningful groups,  prediction of the prospective lung ac diagnostic biomarkers and  validation of the predictive methodology based on a comprehensive list of previously characterized gene markers of lung ac and tissue array validation of the selected discriminative genes. further we discuss how our and other feature selection methods could be improved and used to predict novel gene markers and critical disease-associated molecular pathways.

RESULTS
cross normalization of expressed genes in paired dependent samples improves the discrimination ability of previously characterized gene markers
we introduce a function to characterise the completely discriminative variables  which according to some additional statistical and biological criteria might be considered as the potential clinical biomarkers .

let x and y represent the normal  and malignant paired dependent tissue samples , respectively. the paired signals for microarray identificator j,  , are derived from n patients. the sub-set of n paired dependent signals from quantitatively distinct sample sets is called a completely discriminative signal  if:  

or  

where 1{.} is an indicator function with value  <dig> if the expression in brackets holds and  <dig> otherwise. when , the signal is called incomplete discriminative signal .

even if all paired samples are cds in a given patient cohort, the increase of the number of patients  should lead to failure of “completeness” of a given discriminative feature.

in order to select the prospective gene markers of ac and evaluate potential biomarker space of ac, we used  <dig> u133a affymetrix microarray designed in pairs: lung ac versus surrounding lung tissue, which have been obtained from  <dig> lung ac patients  <cit> . the mas <dig> normalized expression data and the patients’ clinical information were obtained from ncbi's geo database  using the geo accession number gse <dig> and  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the work flow of our discriminative feature selection method and more details are described in methods.

we used the sign symmetry test to estimate the p-value, p, of having random classification on two groups . in particular, in the extreme case of cds  for our  <dig> samples  after bonferroni adjustment we get the p-value estimate  . at one  misclassification errors we get  and at two  misclassification errors we get . at the 93% confidence level, the significance of the above p-values indicates that cds is not by chance.

in this work mostly cds expression signals are considered as the prospective gene markers. however, a relatively weak relaxation of the extreme criteria  is also considered, but at specified statistical conditions . in our feature selection method we used cross-normalization  method followed by our modified wilcoxon sign rank test  .

to demonstrate a performance of cn and mwt with respect to its discrimination ability of the gene expression paired samples, we started with several well-defined gene markers of lung ac: egfr  <cit> , osteopontin   <cit> , xage- <dig>   <cit> , s100a <dig>  <cit> , and cblc  <cit> . the probe sets 201983_s_at , 209875_s_at, 220057_at, 204268_at and 220638_s_at correspond to these genes, respectively. figure  <dig> shows that the cn provides significant improvement of the separation of the paired microarray signals for all discussed gene markers of lung ac.

we also re-analysed the five-gene lung ac diagnostic signature, which was identified from protein network analysis combined with the microarray gene expression data analysis  <cit> . this signature includes myst <dig>  cdk <dig>  brca <dig>  ehmt <dig> and e2f <dig> genes, represented on the u133a chip by the probe sets 202423_at, 211297_s_at, 204531_s_at, 202326_at, 2028_s_at, respectively. we compared the results of the classification of  <dig> paired samples based on the initial  u133a data   <cit>  and based on additional data treatment,- mutual cross-normalization .

thus, cn provides a systematic improvement of the separation ability of the paired microarray signals for well characterized biomarkers of ac and for gene markers of the ac diagnostic signature  <cit>  having a high discrimination ability of lung ac versus adjacent lung tissue.

ecd identifies  <dig> -signals signature and reveals the global genome reprogramming in ac cells
our task here is to identify extremely discriminative gene expression signals  using  <dig> pairs of lung acs and surround normal lung tissues. using  <dig>  u133a affymetrix probe sets gse <dig> and applying consequently cn and mwt, we extracted a set of  <dig>  affymetrix u133a providing complete sample separation. the bootstrap version of ranked welch test  <cit>  p-value at α = 5%  was then applied to select  <dig>  statistically significant probe sets  , representing by  <dig>  different genecards gene ids . this set we defined here as the pt-at extremely discriminative classifier. these results demonstrate high sensitivity of our method and suggest a global reprogramming of lung ac cell genome in comparison with the genomes of the surrounding lung tissue cells.

ecd signature is strongly overlapped with previously reported ac –associated gene sets and includes key functional gene subsets
further we assessed overlap of the pt-at ecd classifier with significance analysis of microarrays  classifier derived in this work using data  <cit> , which consists of expression profiles represented by  <dig>  probe sets detected in the normal and lung tumour tissues. according to the filtering clinical and histologic data, we pre-selected  <dig> u95a affymetrix microarrays profiling  <dig> normal lung tissue samples and  <dig> ac tissue samples  <cit> . we used sam method  <cit>  at 5% local false-discovery rate sam  score, which selects 1717-probesets ac signature.  <dig> of the  <dig> probe sets represent  <dig> up-regulated ac genes and  <dig> probe sets represent  <dig> down-regulated ac genes .

these data integration results demonstrate a good agreement between sam u95a signature and ecd u133a signature:  <dig> refseq genes are common .  <dig> of the  <dig> genes are up-regulated and other  <dig> of the  <dig> genes are down-regulated in ac. fold change enrichment of the common gene terms in up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes versus random co-occurrence events is  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the hypergeometric test with extremely significant p-values  suggests the high agreement rate among the gene signatures. a high degree of overlapping is found in spite of differences in  microarray types ,  experimental designs ,  feature selection methods  and  difference of the ethnic groups studied in  <cit>   and in  <cit>  .

the go enrichment analysis, performed with the panther go tools, shows the pronounced differences between terms of up- and down-regulated go categories of ‘biological process’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘pathway’ annotation categories . the up-regulated ac gene set overrepresented by the genes involved in primary metabolic, carbohydrate metabolic process, nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process nucleoside, purine metabolism, de novo purine biosynthesis, cell cycle and mytosis, glycolysis, nucleic acid binding, succinate to proprionate conversion and methylmalonyl pathway. for the case of ac down-regulated categories, significant categories include immunity and defence, interleukin signalling pathway, mesoderm development, cell structure and motility, signal transduction, cell surface receptor mediated signal transduction, cell communication, intracellular signalling cascade, cell structure cell adhesion, cell motility . importantly, one of the most strongly suppressed gene groups in lung ac is an immunity gene group. we found that these  <dig> ecd ac down-regulated genes could be consisting of a novel immune system signature of ac . we found also that  <dig> ac up-regulated gene subset which could be consisting of a novel cell cycle signature of ac . these novel signatures might be used for a future development of the diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of the ac patients. 

thus, our bioinformatics analysis strongly supports biological significance of at least  <dig> genes suggesting the clinical importance of the ecd-derived gene signature.

classifiers derived by pam and edge methods
the application of the prediction analysis for microarrays  method  <cit>  to the data under study produced a  <dig> probe set classifier, which had the higher specificity but the lower power, in comparison to other methods . however, to facilitate comparison with other methods , the genes were sorted with the differences between pam up- and down- ‘tumour scores’, and the desired numbers of genes were then selected for further studies. the optimal discovery procedure  method implemented in the edge program was applied to our dataset to identify the best ac-st classifier of  <dig> unique, differentially expressed genes with high statistical significance  . these differential probe sets constitute about  <dig>  % of the total probe sets represented on the arrays. to allow comparison with other methods, the probe sets were ranked using the ‘fdr values’ and the desired numbers of probe sets were then selected for further studies.

comparison of the top gene lists selected by different feature selection methods
to further assess the feature selection performance of ecd, we decided to overlap the top  <dig>  ecd-selected probe sets with the top  <dig>  probe sets derived by edge, pam, wilcoxon and t-tests. the venn diagram in figure  <dig> depicts a high fraction of overlapping  among the groups. however, when a complete ecd signature was compared using the best differentially expressed gene signatures of alternative methods, the ecd provides significantly larger number of the genes separating ac and at samples . on the same time, each alternative method produces a proportion of the genes producing non-zero misclassification error rate .

when the cn data were used for analysis of classification accuracy of the methods, the ecd set provides the highest, closely followed by the standard wilcoxon sign ranked test, edge and the t-test. while none of  <dig>  probe sets from the ecd had  <dig> or more misclassified sample pairs, the same-size top discriminative sets from the standard wilcoxon sign ranked, edge, the t-test and pam had  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  probe sets with  <dig> or more misclassified sample pairs, respectively . thus, cn method improves selection accuracy for the each method used in a feature selection. the improvement effect of cn method was particularly striking for mwt, where the classification errors, in terms of the number of probe sets with two or more misclassified sample pairs, decreased from  <dig> % in the initial mas <dig> normalized dataset to 0% in the cn dataset.

comparison of the classification accuracy of highly discriminative  <dig> probe sets  with top-level  <dig> probe sets identified by standard wilcoxon sign ranked test , edge, pam, and student&#8217s t-test. while the ecd classifier was derived using cross-normalized dataset as input, the classifiers derived using pam, edge, wt and t-test used the original mas5-normalized data as input. however the classification accuracy in terms of the number of probe sets with  <dig> or more anomalous fold changes was estimated using the cross-normalized dataset.

as we expected, cn also produces a substantial improvement in the classification accuracy of the top  <dig>  probe sets identified using other methods. while the misclassifications, in terms of the percentage of probe sets with two or more sample pairs, in the mas <dig> normalized data were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the top  <dig>  probe sets identified using by edge, pam, the standard wilcoxon test and the t-test, respectively, the false classifications for the corresponding probe sets using the cn data were 4%, 12%, 3% and 4%, respectively .

the functional clusters of the lung pt-at extremely discriminative genes
when hierarchical clustering analysis  was applied to  <dig> samples represented by the top-selected  <dig>  probe sets, each of the feature selection method could clearly discriminate tumour samples from all normal samples . however, cn produces fewer and more distinct gene clusters with enhanced difference between lung ac and normal samples . thus cn can be applied after the standard feature selection methods in order to increase the method performance. furthermore, the gene clusters derived from the cross-normalized expression data are also comparatively better enriched in the top level gene ontology  terms.

interestingly, go enrichment analysis of the common biological terms reveals systematically stronger p-value of the enrichment of ecd classifier vs. alternatives. for instance, table s <dig> b of additional file  <dig> shows overrepresentation of cell cycle related genes containing in ecd gene signature vs. edge gene signature.

the hierarchical clustering analysis of the ecd signature grouped the genes into four distinct clusters: cluster  <dig> ;  <dig> refseq genes) and cluster  <dig>  contain down-regulated genes, while cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig>  contain the genes that are up-regulated in the lung ac vs at .

inflammatory response, regulation of cytoskeleton organization, wound healing, negative regulation of cell proliferation and regulation of immune response are some of the categories highly enriched in cluster  <dig>  while enzyme linked receptor protein signalling pathway and metal ion homeostasis are some of the highly enriched categories in cluster  <dig> . among the highly enriched and interesting categories in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are m-phase of mitotic cell cycle, negative regulation of intracellular transport, response to dna damage stimulus, spindle organization, collagen fibril organization, glycolysis, focal adhesion and extracellular structure organization . the biological categories and pathways identified here strongly suggest that the responses to external stimuli and the micro-environmental organization are highly reactive and interconnected to the progression steps of the lung ac via the mitotic cell cycle.

the ecd-based pt-at signatures are strongly associated with ac, other lung cancers and lung diseases
next we studied the disease association of the four clusters of the lung ac discriminative signatures using genego diseases module, which links over  <dig> human diseases with genes. the genego diseases module prioritized  <dig> most highly enriched disease categories ranked according to p-value enrichment. the p-value enrichment values calculated with genego takes into account the gene content variation between complex diseases, such as cancers and some mendelian diseases in addition to the biased coverage of different diseases in literature. the top  <dig> enriched diseases for the  <dig> clusters of our signatures were strongly associated with lung cancers and bronchial/respiratory track diseases . thus, our molecular classifier can be split into four functionally distinct groups, which are highly specific to ac and other lung tumours and lung diseases.


the gene clusters of extremely discriminative gene signatures are associated with metabolic pathway alterations and environment adaptations
the metabolic pathway alterations and environment adaptations of cancer cells is an important area of anti-cancer drug discovery research. the metabolic pathways may create a phenotype that is essential for tumor cell growth and survival, altering the flux along the key metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and glutaminolysis  <cit> . in context of the enrichment analysis of metabolic networks in lung ac, we applied genego metabolic networks enrichment analysis. figure  <dig> shows interesting association of our clusters of discriminative genes with metabolic networks. for example, clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are enriched in glycerol-3-phosphate metabolic pathways, malto-hexaose/-pentose pathways & n-acyl-sphinngosine phosphate pathway, while cluster  <dig> is significantly enriched in genes of carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, glucogenesis and glucose transport pathway. the alterations in these metabolic pathways could lead to changes in the concentration of cognate metabolites. these metabolites could be easily detected in body fluids by non-invasive assays and hence have a great potential for the development of non-invasive diagnostic kits of lung ac.

ecd signatures highly enriched with many previously characterized gene markers
to evaluate the signatures derived from different feature selection methods  on the  <dig> pt-at paired lung ac sample u133a dataset , we catalogued approximately  <dig> references cited as either lung ac prognostic- or diagnostic- biomarkers and further manually selected  <dig> relevant publications and extracted set of  <dig>  genes . this gene set covers individual biomarkers as well as multi-gene signatures and is called here ac meta-signature. to get a more quantitative information about expression profile of these genes in lung ac and to develop comparative analysis of this gene subset vs. other subsets , we integrated ac meta-gene signature information presented in the additional file  <dig> into our gene expression ‘master table’. we used this set as a positive control to evaluate the enrichment of gene signatures studied in this work with the genes associated with lung pt-at discrimination and the genes which could be considered as prospective clinical biomarkers.

the term enrichment of ac meta-gene signature gene markers in various signatures was analysed using a two-sided fisher exact test  <cit> . we tested enrichment of meta-gene signature gene markers with the best gene signatures derived using edge, pam and wt methods and ecd method. we found that all studied classifiers were significantly enriched with ac meta-signature genes. however, ecd provides more complete subset found meta-gene signature. the fisher exact two-tail p-values sorted by significance were  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> for the most highly discriminative gene signatures derived using ecd, edge, pam and wt, respectively.

ac meta-signature genes and ecd pt-at signature demonstrates high enrichment of mutagenesis sites and cancer associated proteins
in all,  <dig> uniprot proteins having mutagenesis site were found with our ecd signature. among these proteins, we found epidermal growth factor receptor , v-erb-b <dig> erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog  <dig>  neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog  , mad <dig> mitotic arrest deficient-like  <dig>  , solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig>  and tumour protein p73-like . mutations in these well-known genes are associated with lung cancer, and specifically ac cells  <cit> . interestingly, according to our finding all these genes are overexpressed in ac vs. at  and could be consists of as the prospective small signature to estimate the risk of occurrence and progression of lung ac.

to better assess the functional annotation of the gene markers enriched in our ecd classifiers, we will focus now on the statistical enrichment analysis of gene set with gene ontology terms   <cit> .

not only genes of “proliferative/cell cycle signature” but many genes encoding proteins that produce signal peptides and metabolic modifications are involved in the development of ac
interestingly, the term “signal peptide” is associated with the proteins which belong to a common fraction  . interestingly, this go category term is not significantly enriched in the unique subset of our ac meta-signature and in the unique subset of our discriminative ac signature. reported peptides could control the essential metabolic processes and tumour development involved in local interaction of tumour with stroma, immune and endocrine system and surrounding cells of ac.

according to david bioinformatics software, a common fraction of our discriminative ac and ac meta-signatures is also strongly enriched with the genes encoding proteins of cell cycle, mitosis, micro-tubular based processes, dna replication, spindle organization, regulation of cell cycle process and other go terms which are typically represented in many “proliferative signatures” reported for many cancers. however, unique subsets are represented by more diverse sub-sets enriched with the specific go terms. for instance, ac meta-signature is strongly over-represented by go terms “protein amino acid phosphorylation”, “phosphate metabolic process”, “intracellular signalling cascade”, “regulation of apoptosis”, while the unique subset of discriminative ac signature is more than 2-times enriched with the go term “vasculature development” and  <dig>  times enriched with the go term “protein amino acid o-linked glycosylation”. the genes representing these two terms were reported in the literature to be the key players in the early stage of cancer progression, tumour dormancy and risk of tumours metastasis.

early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
ef improves significantly when the early diagnostic biomarkers reported in the literature were exclusively compared with the best discriminative genes derived using ecd and the alternative signatures. for instance, table  <dig> lists  <dig> early diagnostic lung ac marker genes, fe of these genes measured using the fisher’s exact two-tail p-values and the ef were  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig>  respectively for the proposed ecd and  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig>  respectively for edge. most of edge selected genes are included in the ecd set . as result, ilf <dig>  retn <dig>  mcm <dig>  muc <dig>  supported from  <dig> to  <dig> studies, where identified by ecd method only. interestingly, several genes of table  <dig> could be considered not only prospective diagnostics biomarkers, have been reported as the prognostic biomarkers . among such ‘dual’ biomarkers we can indicate aurka, top <dig>  ilf <dig>  mcm <dig> and rftn <dig> which should be test as prospective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

# - the references mentioned in this table correspond to the citations used in additional file  <dig> 

thus, among studied feature selection methods, ecd provides the most comprehensive lists of the genes which are strongly supported by the literature as the prospective genes for biomarker discovery.

the size of the ecd-derived pt-at discriminative signature can be extended to derive a classifier that provides better coverage of the ac meta-signature. many ac meta-signature genes are well characterized as promising lung ac biomarkers . however, these gene markers are not present in ecd-derived signature. on the other hand, such gene markers could be found by wmt and the following bootstrap selection when few misclassification errors are allowed. according to previous estimates by the sign test , we allow the feature selection method to select discriminative u <dig> probe sets with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> misclassification errors. in the case of two misclassification errors, ~7% / <dig> x 100%) error rate might be acceptable according the multivariate adjusted sing test. to reduce the risk of false positive selection, we limited the smallest fold change  of mean expression signals in the paired data to higher than  <dig>  and the bootstrap method p-values to less than  <dig> . by applying these criteria, the ensuing pt-at signature with  <dig>  probe sets was obtained . this discriminative set is also strongly enriched with known lung ac meta-signature gene markers .

thus, our extended pt-at discriminative gene set  and its subset of ac early diagnostic gene markers  could be promising data sources to discover novel biomarkers and to investigate already reported promising gene markers.

validation of the diagnostic utility of the proposed lung ac ecd discriminative signature using tissue array assay
in order to validate the diagnostic utility of our discriminative signature we selected two genes spp <dig> and cenpa, both of which showed 100% separation with strong fold change of pt-at pairs in the u133a expression dataset. spp <dig> is a well-characterized gene which is considered as a promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarker of nsclc  <cit> . cenpa is a genomic marker for centromere activity and human diseases, including cancer  <cit> , but it is not established as an important gene for lung ac diagnostics and prognosis.

the results of qrt-pcr tissue arrays of genes  are completely concordant with the microarray analysis ; these genes perfectly discriminate  <dig> lung tumour samples from  <dig> adjacent normal lung samples. additionally, qrt-pcr ct values also show strong fold changes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for spp <dig> and cenpa, consistently with microarray expression fold-changes , strongly suggesting a possibility to consider this gene pair as a prospective biomarker of lung ac.

figure <dig> qrt-pcr validation of potential lung ac diagnostic biomarkers identified using mwt. the separability of the normal-lung ac pairs of the potential lung ac gene markers identified using mwt on lung tissue qrt-pcr array is illustrated, before  and after  application of the cross-normalized expression procedure to spp <dig>  and cenpa .

discrimination error  is the number of misclassified pairs. fold changes for microarray was estimated as the ratio of the mean expression values of ac tissue versus adjacent normal tissue in the same tumour sample. fold change for qrt-pcr was estimated as a ratio of the mean ct values  of lung cancer tissues versus adjacent normal tissues in the same tumour sample. for more details of expression and qrt-pcr data normalization procedures, please refer to the materials and methods section.

discussion
advantages of the proposed ecd method
we demonstrate that the application of cross-class normalized to dependent paired data increases the distance between the objects of two classes and decreases the number of misclassification errors. the method allows us to  better separate the samples of the two classes ,  reduce the number of misclassification errors  in comparison with initial data,  provide a highly sensitive and ultra-specific feature selection procedure of the discriminative features  and  select the most biologically reliable classifiers  representing the classes of interest . our feature selection model uses consequently cn, mwt, and the bootstrap method and sign-rank tests . it selects the statistically significant features  focusing on the complete or almost error-less separation of the dependent paired samples when a limited number of samples is available.

quality control of ecd classifier
we compared the feature selection method based on ecd with the standard methods from the literature, using our aforementioned quality control approach, and then finally assess the efficiency of alternative classifiers and our method, using a comprehensive set of known gene markers of lung cancer. the efficiency of ecd classifier was successfully evaluated in several ways:  by the similarity in content between gene lists selected from the same data <cit>   using ecd and alternative feature selection methods,  by the similarity in content between the gene list selected from the data  <cit>   using ecd and the gene list selected from independent data  <cit>   using sam ,  by the enrichment of previously reported lung ac gene markers in ecd vs. ac meta-gene signature set  by the enrichment of ecd classifier with previously reported lung ac gene markers associated with early stage of the cancer progression, mutagenesis and/or risk of disease progression,  by rt-qpcr validation of the several predicted biomarkers.

the similarity in content between gene lists derived from different data sets
ac signatures reported in the literature have often revealed little agreement in the gene lists produced by different methods. for example, jeffery et al  <cit>  found that only 8-21% of the genes were common across  <dig> selected features selection methods. however, the high level of agreement between ecd signature derived from data  <cit>  and sam signature derived from independent data  <cit>  not only suggest a pronounced content similarity between gene lists, but also demonstrate much higher sensitivity of ecg vs sam. thus, our method has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive.

effectiveness of the classifiers derived using ecd vis-a-vis standard methods
the effectiveness of the classifiers derived using ecd and the classifiers derived using standard method was represented by the test p-values in lung ac- at sample pairs at both individual gene and the gene group levels. our comparative analysis of the selected gene signatures derived by different methods demonstrates the highest specificity and sensitivity of ecd. when cross-normalized data were used, the superiority of the ecd classifier at the pair level is particularly clear. all the probe sets of the ecd classifier perfectly discriminated normal lung from lung ac in all sample pairs. the selected standard methods, such as edge, wilcoxon and student’s t-test discriminated reasonably well too. furthermore, all the methods are comparable, in terms of their ability to discriminate groups of normal and lung ac samples. however, a comparison of the classification accuracy of the various classifiers, obtained from the mas <dig>  normalized data, revealed essential improvements in the discriminative ability obtained upon the cn of the dataset. moreover, in comparison to alternative methods, ecd classifier reveals four well-separated gene clusters. these clusters provide a clear biological interpretation of the grouped gene sets.

discriminative signature of lung ac is highly enriched in previously reported prospective biomarkers for early tumour diagnostics, progression and patient survival
the go analysis suggested the enrichment of our set of predictors with oncogenes and tumour suppressor gene markers. the identification of many well-defined cancer gene markers , such as egfr  <cit> , osteopontin   <cit> , erbb <dig>  <cit> , malat <dig>  <cit> , s100a <dig>  <cit> , s100a <dig>  <cit> , abcc <dig>  <cit>  and eln <dig>  <cit> , as highly discriminative genes by the ecd is quite encouraging . this identification suggests greatly enhances the clinical relevance and potential of ecd signature, as the source novel gene molecular classifiers of the ac and their biomarkers. some selected genes with high discriminative ability, belonging to three cancer-relevant pathways, such as atp-binding cassette  family of genes  were identified as prospective gene markers of lung ac  <cit>  other one  should be also under serious consideration. our microarray analysis results  and preliminary lung tissue array study demonstrated that the abc gene signature, consisting of abca <dig> and abca <dig> together with abcc <dig>  can discriminate lung ac vs at and be considering as a novel lung cancer diagnostic biomarker .

we also identified a large number of cell adhesion and cell communication pathway genes, such as cdh <dig>  spp <dig>  spink and ceacam <dig>  that are highly up-regulated in all lung ac tumours, and hence could be associated with the early metastasis of lung ac. several tumour suppressor genes are expressed at relatively low levels across all paired samples studied. for instance, the transcription of the tcf <dig> gene is strongly suppressed in ac vs. adjacent lung tissue . tcf <dig> has recently been reported as being essential for the differentiation of epithelial cells adjacent to mesenchyme  <cit> . tcf <dig> is considered to be a candidate tumour suppressor at 6q23-q <dig> that is epigenetically inactivated in lung, head and neck cancers  <cit> . tcf <dig> was also mentioned as a promising cancer gene marker in a report that focused on the differential methylation of a short cpg-rich sequence  <cit> . in addition, we found essential differences in the gene expression profiles of key players in the focal adhesion pathway, such as flnb .

discriminative signature and meta-signatures contain genes essential for oncogenesis and tumour progression
we demonstrated that the gene sets of ecd and meta-signature are significantly overlapped and both are highly enriched with the terms of biological processes and molecular functions which according to the literature are essential in the lung cancer and other cancers. unique features of ac meta-signature show a strong association with phosphate metabolic process, intracellular signalling cascade, regulation of proliferation and apoptosis. such functions in combination with activity of the cancer-associated cell proliferative genes are often considered as the aggressiveness score of a primary tumour. the genes and their products of this unique subset might be used as a source of prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

in light of our finding of the differences between common subset and unique ad discriminative signature, we suggest that in addition to the common set of the core proliferative genes, our ecd signature includes a subset of genes encoding proteins that often undergo mutagenesis, provide a regulation of proliferation and the transition steps in the ac development. these genes and their products might be considered as a source of early and differential diagnostic biomarkers as well as the prognostic biomarkers.

feature selection paired design allows estimating the gene marker space discriminating pt-at and predicts high plasticity of the transcritome in ac
using  <dig> u133a microarray profiles of  <dig> paired samples of lung adenocarcinoma  and adjacent lung tissue, we identified the global reprogramming of the transcriptional profile in human lung ac compared to normal lung tissue. through the mutual cn of expression data belonging to dependent paired samples and using a separability score, calculated by the modified wilcoxon signed-rank test, the method provides an essential improvement of the sensitivity of the feature selection at the highest specificity  in a comparison to the alternative methods. our method reveals expression shift of at least  <dig>  genes discriminating lung ac from adjacent normal lung tissues with ~100% accuracy. additionally, more than  <dig> genes could discriminate the lung ac tumours from the normal lung tissues with ~93% accuracy.

systematic structural and functional study of the protein peptides found in the common subset of the meta-signature and ecd signature  should be useful in our understanding of the basic interactions of the tumour with stroma, surrounding tissue, immune and endocrine systems. specifically, we suggest that immunity and signal peptides gene signatures  could be used for early diagnostics of ac and for quantitative monitoring of the adjuvant therapy. thus, we could suggest that these genes may represent promising targets for novel specific therapies.

non-small cell lung cancer  can be classified into the major subtypes, ac, and squamous cell carcinoma . a global gene expression profiling of  <dig> human nsclc specimens revealed large differences between ac and scc subtypes, with more than  <dig> genes found to be differentially expressed  <cit> . the assignment of these genes to biological processes pointed to the deregulation of distinct sets of cell adhesion molecules. in combination with our findings this result reveals an extremely high dimensionality of the potential biomarker space and plasticity of the transcriptome in ac and scc subtypes.

further method improvement and validation studies
ecd provides superior selection in comparison to conventional methods and can be widely used in different applications. however, the selection and classification performance and error estimation strongly depend on the data set size and dimensionality of the co-variate space. it is a challenging task to develop an exact model of microarray data taking into account paired dependent design and to compare the benefit of the model versus non-paired design models. several ways to treat paired dependent data more efficiently in a parametric modelling framework have been proposed  <cit> . using univariate simulation models, the authors showed essential misclassification of variance reduction in paired dependent design model, even when the sample size is relatively small. in the case of small sample size, it is important to develop simulation models based on non-parametric test  and to study  a dependence of misclassification error from the sample size, correlation patterns between paired features,  a role of dimensionality of the co-variate space and other parameters of microarray data and clinical factors.

the thresholds of our feature selection procedure could be fine-tuned and corrected . despite the statistically reasonable cut-off of p-value and the 100%-correct prediction criteria, we found that a large proportion of the lung cancer gene markers reported in the literature were still filtered out . some potentially important gene markers, such as myc and brca <dig>  <cit>   were ignored by ecd due to our extreme criteria. similarly, scgb1a <dig>  identified by the cancer gene database as a cancer-related gene  <cit> , was also filtered out of our gene set due to 100%- correct classification request of our procedure. in addition, among the  <dig> gene markers identified by su et al.  <cit> , the mwt identified only  <dig> genes as potential gene markers. thus, the stringent 100%-correct classification criteria could be relaxed to 7% misclassification error rate, but to control the false discovery rate we should increase the fold-change cut-off value as well. for the mwt classifier we used  <dig>  as the minimum value of fold-change for the 100%-correct classification criteria. we could decrease the cut-off fold-change value down to  <dig> , with 89%-correct classification criteria. in these cases, the relaxed criteria provide an increment in the enrichment of the number of differentially expressed genes and potential ac gene markers included in our ac meta-signature. we still have significantly strong enrichment of the meta-signature genes in extended gene set . such conditions allow including the above mentioned genes, as well as many other meta-signature genes in our extended gene set. more accurate explorations of the discriminative gene signature method will allow development of more statistically- and computationally- oriented feature selection methods.

another area for improvement could be the use of datasets that are comprehensive and have more homogenous patient populations, such as pre-malignant lesions, tissues at the early stage of tumour progression and patients with different immune status.the human lung tissue qrt-pcr array assay of  <dig> paired mrna samples of cancer and adjacent normal lung tissues was used to validate two genes spp <dig> and cenpa, which perfectly discriminate lung ac from pt-ats with consistent fold-changes. these genes are completely discriminative and functionally essential and, thus, could be considered for a simple and accurate diagnostic kit of lung ac.

many other genes and gene subsets which are included in our ecd signature could be validated using expression data from independent cohorts. for example, immunity signature, defined in this study could be basic set for development early ac diagnostic and prognostic kit. these gene set accomplished 100% discrimination ability of the pairs of normal and lung cancer tissue samples, indicating discovery of many novel biomarkers with a significant potential for clinical applications.

CONCLUSIONS
in many medical applications, analysis of data taken from paired samples of the same patient could increase efficiency of the feature selection and reduce a risk of misclassification. we develop a novel feature selection method of microarray analysis of dependent paired sample design. the method identifies and selects highly discriminative variables from high-dimensional data space based on a statistical analysis of paired samples when the number of samples is small. this method provides superior selection in comparison to conventional methods and can be widely used in different applications.

ecd reveals ~ <dig>  patho-biologically essential genes associated with the global transcriptional reprogramming of human lung epithelium cells and lung ac aggressiveness. this gene set includes many known prospective ac biomarkers reflecting inherent disease complexity and specifies the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in the lung ac.

the extremely discriminative genes form four contrast gene co-expression clusters with easy biological interpretation. the 1st most strong cluster represented by lung ac mitotic/cell cycle up-regulated genes, 2-nd cluster is represented by normal lung epithelial cells at the strong suppression, 3-rd and 4-th clusters are represented by the genes involved in cell communication, motility and the immune system.

we identified novel immune system signature of lung ac, which might be used for future development of diagnostics, monitoring and prognosis of the patients with ac.

17% of the proteins encoded by the discriminative genes contain known mutagenesis sites. similar fraction of the known mutagenesis sites was found in the meta- signature set. we suggest that mutagenesis site-containing proteins found in both of our signatures could be considered as casuistic players in pathobiology of ac and prospective gene markers directly involved in molecular mechanisms driving lung carcinogenesis and progression of ac.

a good agreement of selected genes with the set of > <dig> published potential molecular biomarkers and ac signature genes was found. these genes as well as novel genes of ecd-defined lung ac biomarker space could be considered as the comprehensive source of novel biomarkers. the human lung tissue qrt-pcr array assay of  <dig> paired mrna samples of cancer and adjacent normal lung tissues was used to validate two ac discriminating genes spp <dig> and cenpa. both of these genes separate the normal and cancerous mrna expression signals in all  <dig> pairs studied. we suggest that these genes could be considered as the prospective prognostic and diagnostics biomarkers of the human lung ac.
