BACKGROUND
the order tetraodontiformes comprises  <dig> species classified into 8â€“ <dig> families  <cit> . as expected from the relatively large number of families for the indicated species diversity , members of the order are very morphologically diverse. for example, boxfishes have carapaces; tetraodontoids  lack pelvic elements; and ocean sunfishes  lack entire elements of the caudal fin. tetraodontiforms also vary greatly in size: ocean sunfishes may grow up to  <dig> m in total length, while adult filefishes  are less than  <dig> cm in standard length  <cit> . in addition, pufferfishes have compact genomes of approximately  <dig> mb  <cit> . much attention has been paid to two species of pufferfish, takifugu rubripes  <cit>  and tetraodon nigroviridis  <cit> , and the whole genome sequences of both have been published  <cit> . many tetraodontiform fishes have been radiated into various habitats in temperate to tropical regions such as rocky and coral reefs, brackish and freshwaters, deep waters along continental shelves and slopes, and open oceans.

there are several hypotheses regarding the phylogeny of tetraodontiform families. some of the families exhibit great reduction of skeletal elements, and many early studies generally divided the order into two groups, the sclerodermi and gymnodontes  <cit> . scleroderms were considered to be primitive tetraodontiforms, usually having a set of primitive characters such as pelvic fin elements, separate teeth, and spinous dorsal fins. gymnodonts were considered to be derived tetraodontiforms, usually having reductive characters such as no pelvic fin elements, teeth modified into a parrot-like beak, and no spinous dorsal fins. traditionally, the sclerodermi was further divided into two superfamilies , while the gymnodontes was equal to the superfamily tetraodontoidea. in most of phylogenetic studies, a series of the reduction was regarded to parsimoniously occur in derived lineages, and their phylogenetic relationships generally have been proposed to be ) .

several authors have investigated the interrelationships of tetraodontiform fishes via cladistic analyses based on comparative osteology  <cit> , ontogeny  <cit> , myology  <cit> , and karyology  <cit>  and their results are similar to each other . holcroft  <cit>  and alfaro et al.  <cit>  determined the nuclear rag <dig> gene and mitochondrial 12s and 16s rrna gene sequences of representative tetraodontiform lineages and estimated their relationships . both studies did not obtain clear resolution for basal relationships but only two sister-group relationships  with confidence. therefore, many phylogenetic questions in the tetraodontiformes, especially their basal relationships, remain unclear.

whole mitogenome sequences from many teleost lineages have been determined and used for phylogenetic analyses with purposeful taxonomic sampling, which have successfully resolved many controversial issues in systematic ichthyology  <cit> . to address the questions regarding the phylogenetic relationships of the families and subfamilies of tetraodontiformes, we purposefully chose  <dig> species in addition to the 14-tetraodontiform species used by yamanoue et al.  <cit> . together, these represent all families and subfamilies of the tetraodontiformes, except for the hollardinae. we determined whole mitogenome sequences for these  <dig> species, aligned them with the published sequences of the other  <dig> species, including two outgroups , and conducted partitioned maximum likelihood  and bayesian phylogenetic analyses.

RESULTS
the complete l-strand nucleotide sequences from the mitogenomes of the  <dig> species  were deposited in ddbj/embl/genbank . the genome content of the  <dig> species included two rrna,  <dig> trna, and  <dig> protein-coding genes, plus the putative control region, as found in other vertebrates. their gene arrangements were identical to the typical gene order of vertebrates.

*newly determined in this study; 1miya et al.  <cit> ; 2miya et al.  <cit> ; 3yamanoue et al.  <cit> ; 4yamanoue et al.  <cit> ; 5yamanoue et al.  <cit> .

both the pairwise transitional  and transversional  differences for each partition increased with increasing evolutionary distance, with the exception of the ts differences at the third codon position of protein-coding genes , in which marked saturation has been observed in early stages of evolution  with no increases thereafter. it was apparent that some degree of saturation also occurred at other positions , although pairwise differences seemed to accumulate steadily along the time axis.

although we were unable to determine a priori which data set recovered a more likely phylogeny, we considered that the 12n3rrtn data set  represented the best estimate of phylogenies, which effectively removes the likely noise from quickly saturated transitional changes in the third codon positions  <cit>  and avoids a lack of signal by retaining all available positions in the data set  <cit> . accordingly, the resultant tree from the 12n3rrtn data set derived from the partitioned ml and bayesian analyses is shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  with statistical support  for 12n3rrtn and 123nrtn data sets indicated on each internal branch. no topological incongruities between the two data sets were found.

as in previous molecular analyses  <cit> , our results indicated monophyly of the tetraodontiformes , and supported monophyly of all tetraodontiform families and subfamilies with high statistical values  except for the paraphyletic subfamily tetraodontinae . monophyly of the latter subfamily was rejected by statistical tests using the sh test  and bayes factor . the mitogenomic data unambiguously supported sister-group relationships of balistidae + monacanthidae  and diodontidae + tetraodontidae , which have been reported in most previous morphological and molecular analyses  with a few exceptions . it should be noted that the two data sets consistently reproduced two unexpected clades herein designated as tetraodontoidei and triacanthodoidei with strong statistical support . however, this result may be affected by long-branch attraction because most of tetraodontoids and triacanthodoids comprise lineages with rapid and slow evolutionary rates of mitogenomes, respectively .

discussion
phylogeny of tetraodontiform families
ostraciidae have long been problematic because ostraciids exhibit mosaic morphologies . some early studies classified the family into the sclerodermi together with the balistidae, monacanthidae, and triacanthoidea  <cit> , although others placed the family in the monotypic ostracodermi or ostracoidea  <cit> . the sister-group relationship of ostraciidae with balistidae + monacanthidae was also suggested by many previous authors  <cit> , although leis  <cit>  and rosen  <cit>  placed the ostraciidae within the tetraodontoids based on characters derived from early ontogeny and osteological characters, respectively . subsequently, britz and johnson  <cit>  reported unique characters shared solely by the ostraciidae and molidae , and argued that ostraciids should be included in the tetraodontoids. our mitogenomic analyses placed the ostraciidae within triacanthodoidei, indicating close relationships with the triacanthodidae and triodontidae. our statistical comparisons rejected all previous hypotheses of close relationships with balistidae + monacanthidae , molidae , diodontidae and molidae , and triodontidae + tetraodontidae + diodontidae + molidae  . our results also rejected that of leis  <cit>   and rosen  <cit>  .

our placements of triodontidae and triacanthidae also differ from most of the previous hypotheses . triodon macropterus, a monotypic triodontid with a mosaic of primitive and derived morphological characters . in addition, triodontids possess ribs, which all other tetraodontiform fishes possess except one species of filefishes . although the triodontidae have been considered the basalmost members of the tetraodontoidea in most studies  <cit> , this family has also occasionally been classified as a member of the sclerodermi  <cit> . in our study, a close affinity of triodontidae with tetraodontidae + diodontidae + molidae was not marginally rejected by the sh test  but was strongly rejected by the bayes factor . the ml and bayesian analyses of the mitogenomic data sets, however, strongly suggested that the triodontidae belonged in triacanthodoidei together with the triacanthodidae and ostraciidae .

members of the triacanthidae have primitive morphological characters including paired pelvic fin spines, spinous dorsal fins, and separate teeth, and are often treated as basal members together with the triacanthodidae  <cit> . however, the cladistic analysis of myological characters by winterbottom  <cit>  implied a close relationship between triacanthids and not only triacanthodids but also higher tetraodontiforms . the cladistic analysis of  <dig> morphological characters by santini and tyler  <cit>  also suggested that triacanthids were the sister-group of balistidae + monacanthidae + ostraciidae . our results placed the triacanthidae within tetraodontoidei together with the balistidae, monacanthidae, tetraodontidae, diodontidae, and molidae, but we did not obtain clear relationships within tetraodontoidei. its sister-group relationships with the following groups were not rejected by the sh test but were rejected by the bayes factor: triacanthodidae  and winterbottom's  <cit>  tetraodontoidei .

comparison to previous molecular studies
holcroft  <cit>  reported the first molecular phylogenetic analysis of the tetraodontiform families . the study was based on the rag <dig> gene and the mitochondrial 12s and 16s rrna gene sequences, and bayesian and maximum parsimony analyses using the rag <dig> gene yielded a tree topology similar to previous morphological hypotheses in that the group once called sclerodermi  was confirmed. in contrast, the tree topologies derived from the 12s and 16s rrna genes  were unorthodox, and she concluded that problematic alignment of the mitochondrial data could account for those results. alfaro et al.  <cit>  also employed partitioned ml and bayesian analyses using concatenated sequences of the rag <dig> and mitochondrial 12s and 16s genes from representatives of all families . holcroft  <cit>  and alfaro et al.  <cit>  similarly recovered the sister-group relationships of tetraodontidae + diodontidae and balistidae + monacanthidae, and the paraphyly of tetraodontinae as in our resultant tree .

our mitogenomic tree topology, however, is also incongruent with those derived from molecular analyses of the nuclear rag <dig> genes by holcroft  <cit>   as well as the rag1/mitochondrial 12s and 16s rrna genes by alfaro et al.  <cit>  . holcroft  <cit>  considered the tree derived from the rag <dig> gene to be more reliable than those from the 12s and 16s rrna genes, because there were ambiguities in alignment, apparent saturation in nucleotide substitutions along the time axis, and noticeable codon biases in the latter . alfaro et al.  <cit>  also presented tetraodontiform phylogeny using concatenated sequences of rag1/12s and 16s rrna genes with sequences of triodon macropterus and another representative of the triacanthidae added to the data set of holcroft  <cit> . however, both studies failed to obtain clear resolution for the basal relationships of tetraodontiformes , with a basal polytomy in holcroft  <cit>  and crown node with weak support values  in alfaro et al.  <cit> .

we conducted ml and bayesian analyses using the data sets of holcroft  <cit>   and alfaro et al.  <cit>  with topological constraints on our phylogeny derived from the 12n3rrtn data set . statistical comparisons using the likelihood-based sh test and bayes factor were conducted between the unconstrained and constrained trees based on the data sets of holcroft  <cit>  and alfaro et al.  <cit> . the sh test based on the data set of holcroft  <cit>  did not reject our hypothesis , but the bayes factor very strongly rejected our hypothesis . both the sh test and bayes factor based on the data set of alfaro et al.  <cit>  rejected our hypothesis , but the difference using the sh test was only marginally significant. based on our mitogenome data set, however, the sh test and bayes factor confidently rejected the topologies of both holcroft  <cit>   and alfaro et al.  <cit>  .

considering that the conservative sh test based on the data sets of holcroft  <cit>  and alfaro et al.  <cit>  showed no or only marginally significant differences among trees of rag <dig>  or rag1/12s and 16s rrna genes  and mitogenomes, it seems likely that their data sets did not comprise suitable gene sequences with adequate taxonomic sampling for recovering a precise phylogeny of the tetraodontiformes. our taxonomic sampling represented all families by at least two species  to avoid long-branch attraction. in contrast, the taxonomic sampling of holcroft  <cit>  did not include any triodontids and only one species each of triacanthidae and triacanthodidae, which would lead to long-branch attraction in the resulting tree  <cit> . alfaro et al.  <cit>  improved the data set by adding triodon macropterus  and pseudotriacanthus strigilifer , but a single species was used for the triacanthodidae. it may be argued that more noise-free  nuclear genes are superior for precisely estimating phylogenies  <cit> . however, saitoh et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that non-saturated partitions of the mitochondrial genes  along the time axis do not necessarily result in correct phylogenies among basal groups, due to a lack of phylogenetic signal in the data set; slowly evolving nuclear genes may lack phylogenetic signal.

our mitogenomic data sets  were much longer, and therefore should have far more phylogenetic signals and noise, than those based on the rag <dig> gene  in holcroft  <cit>  and rag1/12s and 16s rrna genes  in alfaro et al.  <cit> . while it is likely that randomly accumulated noise could be masked by phylogenetic signal, noise accumulated systematically may eventually lead to erroneous estimations of phylogenies. thus, increasing the length of sequences with no or little systematic noise should be advantageous for estimating correct phylogenies, while increasing the length of sequences with significant systematic noise would lead to less accurate phylogenies. mitochondrial genes encode basic functions, such as aerobic respiration, in mitochondria  <cit>  and thus are likely to accumulate less systematic noise than functionally specialized nuclear genes. moreover, our data sets were analyzed under appropriate substitution models, partitions, and various treatments of the third codon position  to reduce as much phylogenetic noise as possible. furthermore, the use of shorter sequences or a single gene generates phylogenetic hypotheses that are incongruent or lacking support  <cit> , and increasing sequence length may be a better way to improve support, resolution, and accuracy of a difficult phylogeny . on the other hand, the possibility cannot ruled out that our result was erroneously estimated due to long branch attraction because the two unexpected clades have considerable differences in evolutionary rates of mitogenomes . accordingly, we cannot conclude that our mitogenomic analyses correctly estimated tetraodontiform phylogeny, and further taxonomic sampling and additional gene sequences would be needed to clarify these relationships.

ecological diversification
tetraodontiform fishes are found primarily in coastal shallow waters and estuaries of tropical and temperate regions such as coral and rocky reefs, sandy and muddy bottoms, and sea weed beds  <cit> . moreover, some pufferfishes are radiated into brackish and freshwater in southeast asia, central africa, and south american basins  <cit> , and ocean sunfishes , a few of tetraodontids , and balistids  are widely distributed in open seas  <cit> . on the other hand, a few groups inhabit relatively deep waters of tropical and temperate regions. triacanthodids are distributed in continental shelves and slopes in indo-pacific and caribbean sea  <cit> . triodontids are also distributed in deep waters such as margins of continental shelves and slopes in tropical indo-west pacific  <cit> . ostraciin ostraciids are generally found in shallow waters such as coral reef and near shores, but most aracanin ostraciids occur in continental shelves of temperate indo-west pacific  <cit> . a few tetraodontids  and monacanthids  are also found in deep waters such as continental shelves  <cit> . our most striking finding was the two unexpected clades of tetraodontiformes , which were strongly supported. the basal split of the tetraodontiformes was implied by the mitogenomic analyses of yamanoue et al.  <cit> . we found that the basal split is more congruent with the ecological diversification within the order than that expected from the traditional taxonomy based on morphology. most members of tetraodontoidei exclusively radiated into shallow waters , while those of triacanthodoidei except for more derived ostraciids inhabit relatively deep waters along continental shelves and slopes  <cit> . this suggests that the basal split between the two clades led to subsequent radiation into the two different habitats. as mentioned above, a few species of tetraodontoidei  are found in relatively deep waters. however, it is probable that the center of dispersal for each group of tetraodontoidei is apparently not deep waters but shallow waters because most members of tetraodontids and monacanthids, even those of the same genera with deep-sea inhabitants, are found in shallow waters. on the other hand, most members of triacanthodoidei inhabit deep sea such as continental shelves and slopes. however, ostraciin ostraciids inhabit reefs and near shore  <cit> . considering that most aracanin ostraciids, the plesiomorph sister-group of ostraciin ostraciids  <cit> , occurred in relatively deep waters  <cit> , it seems likely that ostraciin ostraciids were secondarily radiated into shallow waters. alfaro et al.  <cit>  proposed that reef inhabitants exhibit higher species diversity than non-reef species, and this hypothesis may help explain the difference in diversity between tetraodontoidei  and triacanthodoidei  observed in our study .

some molecular studies have reported a basal split according to habitat for some vertebrate groups in their early stage of evolution. placental mammals were divided into the afrotheria and the remaining groups, the former of which were initially restricted to africa  <cit> . in addition, cichlids in the great lakes of east africa are categorized according to which lake they inhabit . due to morphological convergence, the differences in these groups were previously undetectable until the emergence of molecular phylogenies. accordingly, as is the case with our results, clear divergences in habitat at early stages of evolution were often overlooked.

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic analyses of whole mitogenomic data sets confirmed monophyly of all families and subfamilies  and sister-group relationships of balistidae + monacanthidae and tetraodontidae + diodontidae as in the previous studies. we also found an unexpected basal splits into tetraodontoidei  and triacanthodoidei , which has never been reported and challenges previously proposed hypotheses based on both morphology and nuclear sequences. the mitogenomic hypothesis seems more congruent with the basal ecological diversification within the order, because most members of tetraodontoidei exclusively occur in shallow waters , while those of triacanthodoidei occur in relatively deep waters along continental shelves and slopes except for more derived ostraciids. this suggests that the basal split between the two clades led to subsequent radiation into the two different habitats.
