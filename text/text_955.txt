BACKGROUND
dna microarray is a powerful tool in functional genome studies  <cit> . however, it usually generates false positive data as a result of cross-hybridization between highly similar sequences  <cit> . the design approach of polymerase chain reaction  primer with minimal cross homology is an important technology  <cit> . in addition, the recent application of sirnas to silence genes is dependent on the sequence specificity, and the sirna sequence must be selected carefully to avoid similarity to an unrelated mrna  <cit> . thus, the important issue is finding a way to effectively identify specific oligonucleotides .

the early design of specific oligos was based mainly on the use of a frequency matrix  <cit> . subsequently, several approaches were developed to design unique oligos, such as an information-theoretical method based on maximum entropy, which has also been applied to the design of probe sets  <cit> ; a method based on matching the frequency of sequence landscapes, which was used to select optimal oligos for e. coli, s. cerevisiae, and c. elegans  <cit> ; suffix trees, which has been used to select the organism-specific signature oligos  <cit> ; the design of genome-wide specific oligos based on basic local alignment search tool   <cit> ; and the smart filtering technique, which was employed to avoid redundant computation while maintaining accuracy  <cit> .

however, these processes still take a long time to identify specific oligos. it is quite obvious that the high-throughput prediction of specific oligos is important for application in large-scale gene analysis. recently, a method for unique oligo discovery that was a modification of a central pattern partitioning principle was published  <cit> . this method analyzed  <dig> complete genomes representing a wide range of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. however, huge genomes, such as the human genome, were not processed in this report.

an artificial neural network  is a popular learning approach that effectively handles noise and complex relationships in a robust way  <cit> . in previous studies, anns were employed to process a broad range of input parameters on sequence information, such as base composition and binding properties, to predict anti-sense oligos targeting the mrna  <cit> . in addition, anns have been widely applied to various research fields in biology such as clinical cancer research  <cit> , protein function prediction  <cit> , protein classification  <cit> , and cancer classification  <cit> .

in this study, we present a novel and efficient algorithm that integrates ann and blast, named the iab algorithm, to identify specific oligos from the institute for genomic research  human gene index  and rat gene index  databases. furthermore, we applied the iab algorithm to construct specificdb, a web server that provides users with the appropriate hybridization probe, sirna, and primer for the hgi sequences. these tools will be of great benefit to functional genomics studies.

RESULTS
construction of unique marker database and the architecture of ann
the input vector of the ann was derived from the density of the unique subsequences  between 10-mer and 26-mer . in our previous study, an algorithm with 15-mer ud was developed to speed up the identification of a specific probe  <cit>  and we extended and enhanced the algorithm in this study. we established a unique marker database  to store the positions of all unique subsequences for the entire tigr hgi tentative human consensus  database and rgi tentative consensus  database  <cit> . the umd included of 10-mer ~ 26-mer unique marker subsequences and its workflow is illustrated in figure  <dig>  determining the appropriate weights of 10-mer ~ 26-mer ud for the specific oligo prediction was a difficult issue, and the optimal weights depended on the sequence constitution of the genome.

in this study, to determine the optimal weights of 10-mer ~ 26-mer ud, ann was utilized in our algorithm to predict the oligo specificity. table  <dig> shows the number of unique markers and the average density of 10-mer ~ 26-mer unique subsequences in the umd of hgi and rgi. the results reveal that if the length of the screening subsequence  was less than 12-mer, most subsequences were not unique in a large database . on the other hand, if the n-mer was more than 24-mer, many subsequences would be unique . therefore, the construction of the unique marker subsequences with 10-mer ~ 26-mer in the umd was reasonable. the architecture of ann's backward propagation is shown in figure 1b. there were  <dig> input nodes in the ann for the ud of 10-mer ~ 26-mer. the cross homology calculated by wu-blast  <cit>  for each input sequence was as the desired output.

over-fitting and validation
if too much training is applied to the training set, over-fitting of the ann will occur, which means that it will be fitted precisely to the training set and thereby lose accuracy in the independent test set. over-fitting would be expected with sufficiently large anns and sufficiently "successful" training  <cit> . the results of over-fitting tests in this study revealed that the over-fitting effect was dependent on the number of hidden layer nodes .

our results show that the over-fitting effect of the ann performance with  <dig> hidden nodes  is more pronounced than that with  <dig> hidden nodes . furthermore, root mean square error   <cit>  became quite stable and relatively lower when the training cycle number was between  <dig> and  <dig>  the best observed error for the test set happened when the training cycle was  <dig> . thus, the setting of  <dig> cycles was applied to all future procedures. furthermore, k-fold validation was performed on nine training sets  <cit> . thus, nine trained anns were produced and tested using the independent test set. in addition, we also evaluated the ann's performance using an independent large-scale validation set. the results show that the rmses of the test and validation sets had similar profiles and the best rmse occurred in the same training set  for both the test and validation sets . the consistent profile of both the test and validation sets indicates the stability of the ann's performance. thus, the ann trained by tsthc <dig> was selected for genome-wide identification of the specific oligos.

performance comparison for iab algorithm
to investigate the performance at the various lengths of oligos,  <dig> thc sequences on which to perform the iab algorithm, the pure blast search, and the blast search with ud were randomly selected from the hgi database. three performance criteria were computed and evaluated, including success rate, average cross homology and execution time. the sensitivity factor is the maximum percentage of sliding oligos that should be screened by blast. thus, the sensitivity factor is used to adjust the sensitivity of the iab algorithm in this report. moreover, to investigate the effect of the sensitivity factor on performance, various sensitivity factors were evaluated. the results reveal that the iab algorithm relative to other approaches had better or equal quality with a sensitivity factor of  <dig>  for 70-mer, 50-mer, and 25-mer in the success rate, average cross homology, and execution time . thus, the sensitivity factor was set at  <dig>  in all performance comparisons.

specific oligo web server 
to provide a useful and powerful web server named specificdb, the following steps were taken:  unique subsequences with 10-mer ~ 26-mer were created in umd;  training, test, and validation sets were prepared;  k-fold validation was performed on training sets;  the iab algorithm was implemented;  specific oligos including probe, sirna, and primer were constructed; and  the specific oligo database was incorporated into our previous work   <cit>  consisting of microarray analysis, motif discovery, and genome-wide iterative enrichment analysis for micrornas, transcription factors, pathways, and go annotations. users can perform microarray data analysis and enrichment analysis to identify a group of interesting genes, and then discover the specific oligos for the probe, sirna, and primer of these genes in the specificdb web server. the architecture of specificdb is illustrated in figure  <dig>  and the server is available at our web site  <cit> .

application of iab algorithm and the demonstration of predicted primers
the iab algorithm was applied to identify the specific primers of xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris  strain  <dig> contigs that were constructed and sequenced. to locate all of the genes in xcc strain  <dig>  another similar strain, xcc strain  <dig> containing  <dig>  genes  <cit> , was employed to perform sequence alignment. the required information and annotation of xcc strain  <dig> genome is available in the ncbi database.

we aligned the  <dig>  gene sequences against the xcc strain  <dig> contigs to obtain the annotation data of the contigs. the results showed that the average sequence similarity between the two strains was  <dig> %. there were  <dig>  genes with similarity in excess of 90% that were selected as the predicted genes in xcc strain  <dig>  in order to avoid the non-specific annealing of predicted primers, three additional genomes  were merged with the xcc strain  <dig> contigs to build an integrated nucleotide sequence database that was used for non-specific oligo filtration. a total of  <dig>  primer sets were identified from  <dig>  genes by using a cross homology threshold of 85% against the integrated nucleotide sequence database . more than 93% of all the genes contained the specific and valid primer sets.

to demonstrate the applicability of predicted primers, we selected  <dig> and  <dig> genes related to sos response  <cit>  and rpoe  <cit>  respectively, as well as  <dig> randomly selected genes in xcc strain  <dig> to perform pcr amplification using the primers predicted by the iab algorithm. in addition, to verify the primer design based on the iab algorithm for large genomes such as human, we randomly selected  <dig> human primer sets from our specificdb database and performed pcr amplification. a total of  <dig> pcr reactions  were performed in twice and followed by electrophoresis analysis. if a pcr product with correct size can be found at least once, we count the result as a success. the pcr results show that the success rate was 95% and 93% for xcc and human, respectively, and all pcr products had correct size. representative results are shown in figure  <dig>  in human pcr results, there is one gene  that has multiple bands but a single dominant band with correct size.

discussion
several important techniques in molecular biology, such as sirna, microarray, and primer design, need short and specific oligos. the prediction of short and specific oligos is essential for these applications  <cit> . the blast search can be utilized to deal with the identification of specific oligos  <cit>  but it requires too much computing time to screen all sliding oligos. thus, a fast and efficient predictor for sequence specificity is needed  <cit> . in this study, ann is used as a predictor to filter out the oligos with high cross homology before the blast search. here, a new method for genome-wide identification of specific oligos is developed, and it integrates ann and blast to optimize the sequence analysis by using the densities of the various length unique subsequences.

early in this study, we investigated repeat frequencies of subsequence  and shannon's entropy of subsequence frequencies distributions  <cit> , which are related to the degeneracy of the subsequence coding scheme. however, we did not discover an efficient method to integrate these distributions . in this report, we found that the integration of the 10-mer ~ 26-mer ud and ann is an efficient approach to predict oligo specificity.

in sirna design, blast is frequently used to determine the specificity of sirnas. however, blast may lose sensitivity and miss important alignment for such short oligos as sirnas  <cit> . on the other hand, the sensitivity of blast depends on the word length parameter so that shorter word lengths may increase sensitivity but decrease execution speed. to investigate the impact of the word length, several word lengths  were employed to evaluate the performance of our algorithm on specific short oligo identification. table  <dig> shows that the iab algorithm enjoys significant improvement in speed for various word lengths. thus, the shorter word length can be applied to improve sensitivity in the iab algorithm.

the combination of ann and ud is a part of the iab algorithm. the performance comparison of the iab algorithm and the blast search with ud revealed that ann is an important component in the iab algorithm . the iab algorithm with appropriate sensitivity factor had lower cross homology and shorter execution time. although the iab algorithm only screened a portion of the sliding oligos, it still had better quality than the pure blast search that may screen all sliding oligos.

it is difficult to understand the inside workings of an ann, where learned knowledge is contained in the weight  of synapse in the ann structure. thus, the ann is usually treated as a black box  <cit>  and the biological significance inside can not be interpreted. however, anns have been applied to various research fields in bioinformatics. in addition, the unique subsequence distribution has also been utilized in various aspects of sequence analysis  <cit> . in this study, we integrated a wide range of unique subsequences  using the ann approach to improve the identification of specific oligos. such a wide range of unique subsequences has not been previously reported.

ann training for every genome and every length of oligo is inflexible and inconvenient for applications, but our findings indicate that the iab algorithm may overcome this problem. table  <dig> demonstrates the robustness of our algorithm by applying the ann trained for 70-mer oligos to the prediction of 50-mer and 25-mer specific oligos. our results show that the predictions for the 50-mer and 25-mer specific oligos have similar performance to that of the 70-mer.

furthermore, to understand whether the final trained ann from hgi could be applied to other genomes, we derived the 70-mer training, test, and validation sets from rgi, and performed a k-fold validation method to obtain the best trained ann. then, we randomly selected  <dig> rgi tc sequences to carry out the specific oligo selection by using the trained ann of hgi and rgi with iab, as well as the pure blast search and the blast with ud. the results of the experiments show that trained ann from both hgi and rgi had almost the same performance in specific oligo selection for the rgi database . therefore, it may be not necessary to perform the complicated procedures of training a new ann for rgi. thus, the final trained ann from hgi has robustness to other genomes such as rgi, and the iab algorithm can be employed across species for specific oligo identification.

biological researchers may obtain a list of marker genes related to human diseases or the gene expression signature derived from microarray analysis. in order to provide these researchers with useful bioinformatic tools to further investigate the genes, our specificdb web server provides a web interface to perform microarray data analysis and discover significant enrichment of micrornas, transcription factors, pathways, and gos. for example, after enrichment analysis, users can identify a panel of genes that may have significant differential expression in microarray data and have significant enrichment with a pathway. specificdb can bring out the specific and valid probes, sirnas, and primers corresponding to these genes.

to demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm, xcc genome analysis and genome-wide primer design have been carried out. s. cerevisiae and e. coli are usually the major contaminants in the laboratory environment, which may influence the accuracy of experiments  <cit> . to reduce the cross homology with these species, we established an integrated nucleotide sequence database consisting of four genomes  for non-specific oligo filtration. nevertheless, the results of this primer design can not be treated as completely species-specific primers. the results of pcr amplification with primers predicted by the iab algorithm provide evidence in support of the effectiveness and accuracy of our novel algorithm.

CONCLUSIONS
a new algorithm, the iab algorithm, integrates ann and blast to select specific oligos, and makes use of the unique markers in umd. the iab algorithm can effectively identify specific oligos that can serve as microarray probes, sirnas, and primers. to demonstrate the specific oligo prediction ability of this algorithm, the whole-genome primer sets of xcc strain  <dig> and human were designed and validated using biological pcr experiments. specificdb, derived from the iab algorithm, is not only a comprehensive bioinformatic database but is also a useful web server, and is useful for functional genomics and systems biology studies.
