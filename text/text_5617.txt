BACKGROUND
alternative splicing can provide a large reservoir of transcriptional variants from the ~ <dig>  genes identified by the human genome project  <cit> . the production of different isoforms due to the usage of alternative transcription start sites , which was once considered as uncommon, has now been found in the majority of human genes  <cit> . alternative tsss could be results of a gene duplication event followed by the loss of functional exons in the upstream copy and diversification of the two duplicated promoters. alternative tss usage can affect gene expression and generate diversity in a variety of ways. on the transcriptional level, alternative tss could result in tissue-specific expression, temporally regulated expression, and the amplitude of expression. on the post-transcriptional level, alternative tss can affect the stability and translational efficiency of the mrna. furthermore, alternative tss can result in protein isoforms with a different amino terminus, which can lead to alterations in protein levels, functions, or subcellular distribution. therefore, the investigation of temporal switching of tsss can provide insights into the regulation of different protein isoforms, and presumably their differences in function. one way to optimally identify differential use of isoforms is to examine transcriptional regulation over developmental time.

one high-throughput technique to survey gene expression at the transcriptome level is cap analysis gene expression  which generates a genome-wide expression profile based on sequences from the 5′ end of the mrna  <cit> . in the fantom project, cage has been shown to identify different tsss and the corresponding promoters for single genes . with cage data, one can infer the tss usage through the number of transcripts produced at that particular tss. when more than one tss is used at a single time point from a single gene, the tss with highest expression is considered the “dominant” tss. the understanding of how the tss usage changes during development can shed light on how a single gene can function differently over developmental stages through temporally regulated alternative mrna and protein isoforms.

the complexity of brain development requires intricately controlled expression of specific genes across time. the cerebellum is often used as a model in analyses of brain development due to its limited number of major cell types. these cells are positioned in spatially defined territories of the developing cerebellum. the cerebellum has also been the focus of two extensive genome-wide gene expression profiling of the developing cerebellum  <cit> . detailed information on temporally regulated promoter usage of developmentally important genes - which is still largely lacking - can provide valuable information on genome diversity. moreover, different isoforms of these genes may be translated into distinct protein products that perform different tasks. such analyses would give insight to the alterations made to the form of the final transcript, localization for transcription factors motif prediction, utilization, and associated regulatory network changes. thus, in collaboration with the fantom <dig> project  <cit> , we generated a cage dataset for the developing cerebellum with  <dig> time points to study temporally-regulated gene expression and alternative tss usage during cerebellar development.

tss switching events across samples were systematically identified by comparing differential promoter transcription levels between pairs of tsss and pairs of developmental time points, and by applying the silvapulle fq test, a statistical method for constrained hypothesis testing that we specifically apply for the detection of crossover tss switching events  <cit> . the fq test produces p-values to estimate significance of a crossover switching event. we have applied the fq test to our cerebellar time series to identify novel tss switching events during cerebellar development. our hypothesis was that differential tss usage can result in significant regulatory changes that underlie cellular events critical for cerebellar development and morphogenesis. by taking advantage of the fantom <dig> collaboration with our cerebellar developmental time course, we identified  <dig>  novel tss switching events, including  <dig> events in which the dominant tss shifts over time. these tss switching events were predicted to produce temporally-specific gene transcripts and protein products that can play important regulatory and functional roles during cerebellar development.

methods
mouse colony maintenance and breeding
this research was performed with ethics approval from the canadian council on animal care and research conducted in accordance with protocol a12– <dig>  c57bl/6 j mice were used in all experiments and were imported from the jackson laboratory  and maintained in our colony as an inbred line. to standardize the time of conception, timed pregnancies were set up. every weekday at 10:00 am, females were coupled with male; at 3:00 pm, the females were checked for vaginal plugs and removed from their partners. the appearance of a vaginal plug was recorded as the day of conception  and embryos were collected at 10 am on embryonic day 11– <dig>  every day and postnatal day 0– <dig>  every 3 days for a total of  <dig> time points in our cerebellar time series.

tissue processing
on the day of embryo collection, the mothers were sacrificed and embryos were removed from the uterus in ice-cold rnase-free pbs. cerebella were dissected from the head of the embryos, then pooled with littermates, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. three replicate pools of whole cerebella samples were collected at each time point. the standard trizol rna extraction protocol  <cit>  was used for tissue homogenization and rna extraction.

quality assessment
a bioanalyzer  was used to examine rna quality. all rna samples used for the time series achieved high rna integrity  scores above  <dig> . the samples were sent to riken omics center at yokohama, japan, as part of functional annotation of the mammalian genome  <dig>  collaboration for cage analysis.

transcriptome library generation by heliscopecage
cage is a technique that generates a genome-wide expression profile based on sequences from the 5′ end of the mrna. with cage, the first 27 bp from the 5′ end of rnas were extracted and reverse-transcribed to dna  <cit> . the short dna fragments were then systematically sequenced with the helicos platform  <cit> . each sequenced tag was then mapped to the reference genome to identify the transcription start site  of the gene from which it was transcribed. “tag per million”  was used as a measure of the expression level of rnas based on concentration – an expression of “10tpm” means that out of each million total transcripts,  <dig> were transcribed from the tss in question. alternative tsss  can be detected when multiple cage tags are mapped to the same gene locus in the reference genome. mapped cage tags can be clustered into promoter regions after thresholding to determine bona fide promoter regions in the genome. for this analysis, we use the list of promoter regions published by the fantom <dig> consortium  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a schematic diagram of alternative transcription start sites  and the classes of tss switching. a alternative tsss can generate different splicing variants that can be translated into different protein isoforms. *the functional domains may be affected by alternative tsss which results in functional diversity. b different outcomes comparing alternative tss usage at two time points – no tss switching, non-crossover tss switching or crossover tss switching. y-axis represents the quantitative measure of tss usage measured by the expression level of its mrna transcript. x-axis represents the two developmental time points used in the comparison 




tss switch detection
tss switching events are detected by comparing the expression of transcripts from two tsss of a single gene at two time points. the difference in expression level of the two tsss is designated d <dig> and d <dig> at time point  <dig> and time point  <dig>  respectively. the null hypothesis is that there is no switching for the two tsss . the test of this hypothesis was performed using the standard t-test, with candidate switching events identified at this preliminary stage if the adjusted p-value was < <dig> . a non-crossover tss event is detected if one tss is used more frequently at one time point compared to the other, but the same tss is used dominantly at both time points . a crossover tss switching event is detected if one tss is used more frequently at one time point compared to the other, and that the dominant tss switches at the two time points . in order to reduce potential confounding of tss switching events by differential aggregate promoter expression between time points, candidate events were further limited to tss pairs that do not change in overall mean expression between developmental stages being compared. the null hypothesis tested at this stage is that the mean tss expression at the two time points is equal, and results were filtered out if the t-test adjusted p-value was < <dig> .

in addition to the differences in expression , the results of tss switching are represented using the fq statistic  <cit>  which formally tests for the presence of crossover switching for each gene. the test of the null hypothesis of no differential crossover promoter usage corresponds to a test involving the fq statistic, which is functionally similar to the anova f-test. exact p-values for this test are obtained as described in silvapulle  <cit> . to our knowledge, the silvapulle fq test is the only statistical test available that was specifically developed for testing hypotheses regarding qualitative interaction, and which we apply in the current study for testing the presence of crossover switching in gene promoter usage.

all p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons using the benjamini–hochberg method to control the false discovery rate. the p-value of the fq test was used as an indicator of significance for choosing biological validation candidates.

gene ontology analysis for gene with crossover switching events
to identify cellular processes and molecular pathways in genes with crossover tss switching events, we used database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery program  to examine the gene ontology of genes with at least one crossover event with p <  <dig>  in fq test. top  <dig> go terms were used for overall analysis in crossover tss switching genes during cerebellar development. furthermore, for temporal functional analysis of crossover tss switching events, top  <dig> go terms were generated with david for all events associated with three developmental time points – e <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig> 

in silico validation of gene expression with established databases and experimental validation with gene structure prediction and quantitative real-time pcr
we used online databases to examine the  <dig> genes with the lowest p-values. first, we used in situ resources - genepaint  and allen brain atlas  to examine the genes’ expression in the cerebellum. second, we examined the predicted mrna structures from the two tsss with the intron/exon database aceview  as well as functional domains of their protein products from protein domain database phosphositeplus  to determine the potential effect of tss switching events on biological function.

three genes were chosen for further validation for tss-specific quantitative real-time pcr for the validation of alteration in tss usage at e <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig>  cerebellar rna was extracted from c57bl/6 j mice at e <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig> following the same procedure that were used for heliscopecage rna collection. cdnas were produced with random hexamers using the high capacity cdna archive kit . cdna products were diluted to 100 ng total rna input. sequences of the transcript of interest were loaded into primer express® software . for each gene, an isoform-specific forward primer was designed for each of the long and short isoform, while the reverse primer aligns to a common sequence that is shared by both isoforms. amplicon lengths were between  <dig> and 120 bp. the qpcr was performed with the fast sybr green pcr master mix  on an abi stepone plus sequence detection system . all runs were normalized to the control gene, gapdh. three biological replicates were prepared for each gene target and three technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate. gene expression was represented as relative quantity against the negative control which used water as the template . the results of real-time pcr were analyzed and graphed by abi stepone plus sequence detection system . the expression data were compared with the heliscope-cage data.

RESULTS
overview of promoter switch events during cerebellar development
our cerebellar time series, which consisted of transcriptome data from  <dig> time points, yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> cage tags that are mapped to  <dig>  genes in the reference genome. we identified  <dig>  tss switching events  in the cerebellar time series data that occur in  <dig> genes. these events are comprised of  <dig>  non-crossover switching events  that occur in  <dig> genes, and  <dig> crossover switching events  that occur in  <dig> genes. one thousand three hundred seventy-one out of  <dig> genes  that have crossover tss switching events also have at least one non-crossover switching event. this indicates that crossover tss switching events are rarer and occur in fewer genes when compared to the non-crossover events.fig.  <dig> overview of tss switching events during cerebellar development. a overview of  <dig>  tss switching events during cerebellar development. these events significantly deviate from the no-switching line  . b overview of  <dig>  non-crossover tss switching events during cerebellar development. c overview of  <dig> crossover tss switching events during cerebellar development. x-axis represents d <dig>  which is the difference in expression between the two tsss, measured in tags per million , at developmental time point  <dig> , see fig. 1b for a graphic illustration. y-axis represents d <dig>  which is the difference in expression between the two tsss, measured in tag per million  at developmental time point  <dig> , see fig. 1b for a graphic illustration




when comparing the cerebellar tss switching data to nine other tissues in the fantom <dig> dataset , our cerebellar development time series has the 3rd highest total number of tss switching events  behind “epithelial to mesenchymal”  and “adipocyte differentiation” ; and is the highest of the three samples derived from ectoderm . while the cerebellar development time series has less total events than “epithelial to mesenchymal” and “adipocyte differentiation” samples, it has a higher frequency of crossover tss switching events -  <dig> % vs  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. interestingly, when compared to  <dig>  events found in the cerebellum, four out of the five remaining datasets had a higher percentage of crossover events but a much lower number of total switching events.table  <dig> comparison of tss switching events during cerebellar development with other fantom <dig> datasets

in conclusion, cerebellar development showed a high frequency in crossover tss switching among datasets with a high number of total switching events.

distribution of tss switching events in cerebellar transcriptome
when we looked at the distribution of the  <dig>  tss switching events over the  <dig> genes, we found a majority of genes with few events and a minority of genes with many events. thus, we found there are  <dig>  genes with one tss switching event; and only two genes with more than  <dig> switching events . when we looked at the top  <dig> genes with the most tss events , we observed that these genes account for  <dig> % for all tss switching events, or a total of  <dig> events. from fig.  <dig> , we can see that there are two outlier genes that have the largest number of tss switching events for all  <dig> groups  - frmd4a  with a total of  <dig> tss switching events and ank <dig>  with a total of  <dig> tss switching events . these two genes have more than twice the number of tss switching events than the next closest gene, abr  with a total of  <dig> tss switching events. the numbers of tss switching events are more evenly distributed across the rest of the  <dig> genes with a higher frequency of switching  as the difference between each rank is less than 10% of the number of events in this group.fig.  <dig> distribution tss switching events in different genes during cerebellar development. a distribution  <dig>  tss switching events in genes during cerebellar development. arrow points to the two genes with more than  <dig> switching events. b overview of  <dig>  non-crossover tss switching events in  <dig> genes during cerebellar development. c overview of  <dig> crossover tss switching events in  <dig> genes during cerebellar development. x-axis – number of tss events occurs within one gene . y-axis – number of genes that have the number of tss events indicated on the x-axis





when comparing the distribution of crossover and non-crossover events, we found that crossover switching events are clustered in fewer genes when compared with non-crossover events. since the frequency of non-crossover switching is about four times the number of cross-over , we would expect roughly a 4: <dig> ratio for non-crossover: crossover events for any given gene, assuming an even distribution of both categories. indeed, we observed roughly a 4: <dig> ratio for ablim <dig>  and dlg <dig> . however, for the majority of the  <dig> genes with the greatest number of switching events, the frequency of crossover events is much higher than one fourth of the non-crossover counterpart, such as the two outlier genes mentioned above - frmd4a  and ank <dig> . this un-even distribution of crossover events is also reflected by the lower abundance of genes with a low number of switching events –  <dig> genes have less than  <dig> non-crossover events  and only  <dig> genes have less than  <dig> crossover events . in conclusion, we found that crossover events tend to cluster in a fewer number of genes when compared to the non-crossover counterpart.

gradual increment in the number of crossover tss switching events over developmental time
next, we focused in the temporal distribution of crossover tss switching. when we look at a day-to-day change in promoter usage , tss switching occurs evenly across cerebellar development from  <dig> events to  <dig> events - with the exception of the e13-e <dig> comparison . there are  <dig> tss switching events between e <dig> and e <dig> indicating a major shift in promoter usage at this developmental stage.table  <dig> distribution of crossover tss switching events across time in cerebellar development

for example,  <dig> in column  <dig>  row  <dig> represents  <dig> crossover events found between e <dig> and e13




to examine the general pattern of tss switching during cerebellar development, we counted promoter switch events by developmental time points . among the  <dig> data points in our time course, a total of  <dig> comparisons between two data points have been carried out to search for the switching of alternative tsss . over the time series, there is a general incremental number of crossover switching events that are detected between two samples that are temporally distant. this most likely reflects the gradual shift of cerebellar transcriptome and tss usage during development. there are rare exceptions to this pattern, for example, there are more switching events between e <dig> and e <dig> samples than found between e <dig> and e <dig> samples.

gene ontology analysis for genes with the most significant crossover tss switching events
to functionally annotate the genes that undergo significant crossover tss switching, we used the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery program  to examine the biological process and terms associated with crossover tss switching genes. from  <dig> genes with  <dig> crossover tss switching events at p <  <dig> , we analyzed  <dig> gene ontology  terms with the lowest p-value from the david analysis . terms associated with neuronal development, such as “neuron development”, “neuron projection” and “synapse” also showed up at high significance levels from david analyses .fig.  <dig> go analysis for genes significant  for crossover switching at all time points  and at three selected time points . a top  <dig> terms from go analysis of all  <dig> crossover tss switching events in  <dig> genes for column heading: “term” is the go term, “count” is the number of genes associated with the go term and “%” is the fraction of the number of genes associated with the go term divided by the total input of  <dig> genes, “pvalue” and “bonferroni” represent the significance of the go term. b a venn diagram comparing the top  <dig> go terms from crossover tss switching events between all samples and either e <dig>  e <dig> or p <dig> samples




we have found that the largest alteration in gene expression occurs at e <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig>  and were interested to determine the extent that crossover tss switching plays a role in transcriptome diversity. when comparing crossover events at e <dig> with all other time points we find  <dig> significant  events in  <dig> genes. when comparing crossover events at e <dig> with other time points we find  <dig> significant  events in  <dig> genes. finally, when comparing crossover events at p <dig> with all other time points we find  <dig> significant  events in  <dig> genes. we used these gene lists as input to david and the top  <dig> terms were selected for these temporal comparisons among the three time points . we found that  <dig> terms  were shared among each of the three time points. these  <dig> go terms were also found among the  <dig> most significant terms in the analysis with all genes discussed previously. we also observed that comparisons between shorter time spans yield more common go terms –e.g., there are  <dig> terms shared between genes with crossover tss events at e <dig> and e <dig>   <dig> term between e <dig> and p <dig> and no terms were common between e <dig> and p <dig>  lastly, the majority of go terms unique to a given time point shared a common theme that may reflect active biological process occurring at the given time – e.g., four out of eight e <dig> terms were associated with cell motion and cytoskeleton; five out of seven e <dig> terms were associated with ion binding and six out of twelve p <dig> terms were associated with regulation of intracellular organization.

validation of promoter switching events
to further investigate the genes with the  <dig> most significant tss switching events, we used the in situ hybridization expression database genepaint  to examine their expression pattern in the cerebellum . three of these genes showed robust cerebellar expression  and were chosen to demonstrate the potential biological roles of the tss switching events during cerebellar development. first, their mrna structures were obtained from the intron/exon database aceview ; then their protein structure for each isoform was obtained from protein domain database phosphositeplus ; finally, the tss switching events for these three genes were validated with quantitative real-time pcr with promoter-specific primers.table  <dig> cerebellar expression patterns of genes with most significant switching events at e <dig>  from the in situ database, genepaint

when we investigate the role of the most significant tss switching events, we found that some of the most significant events do not seem to affect protein sequence and may play roles in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. one example we examined is glypican- <dig> - a member of glypican family that is found on the cell surface and plays important roles in cellular growth control and differentiation. the two tss sites are 32 bp apart in the genome and mrna that originate from the two tss sites differ in the first exon in the 5’utr region . the two forms of mrna were predicted to be translated into the same protein isoform that contains  <dig> amino acids. the single glypican domain that makes up the majority of the peptide is not effected by the tss switching event . therefore, the usage of alternative tsss in gpc <dig>  which is expressed in the ne, ntz and egl in the cerebellum , could play a regulatory role, such as temporally regulated expression, amplitude of expression, mrna stability and mrna translational efficiency. our qrt-pcr data confirmed the tss switching prediction  and showed that it undergoes a non-crossover tss switching between e <dig>  and p <dig> .fig.  <dig> alternative tsss in glypican  <dig>  and experimental validation of its non-crossover switching events with real-time pcr. a schematic dna structure of gpc <dig>  alternative mrna variants and un-altered protein structure. b in situ expression of gpc <dig> in mouse cerebellum at e <dig>  . c heliscopecage expression data for the two alternative tsss during cerebellar development. x-axis: time, from embryonic day  <dig>  to postnatal day  <dig> . y-axis: expression level measured in tpm . d qrt-pcr expression data demonstrating a non-crossover tss switching event between e <dig> and p <dig>  x-axis: time at e <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig>  y-axis: expression level measured in rq 




some of the most significant tss switching events occur between two tsss that could produce protein isoforms with different n-termini, which may or may not affect the function of the protein isoforms. an example of this would be acidic  nuclear phosphoprotein  <dig> family member a  - a member of acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 kda  family. the two tss sites are 328 bp apart in the genome and mrna that originate from the two tss sites differs in the first exon in the 5′utr region as well as the n-terminus of protein products. the first  <dig> amino acids of the long isoform were absent on the short isoform. functional domains were not affected by the tss switching event - both isoforms retained two lrr <dig> domains and a single nop <dig> domain . the difference at the n-terminus can lead to alterations in anp32a’s protein level, subcellular distribution or function in the egl where it is strongly expressed . as predicted  and validated with our qrt-pcr data, anp32a undergoes a crossover tss switching between e <dig>  and p <dig> .fig.  <dig> alternative tsss in acidic nuclear phosphoprotein  <dig> family, member a  and experimental validation of its crossover switching events with real-time pcr. a schematic dna structure of anp32a, alternative mrna variants and altered protein structure at the n-terminus. b in situ expression of anp32a in mouse cerebellum at e <dig>  . c heliscopecage expression data for the two alternative tsss during cerebellar development. x-axis: time, from embryonic day  <dig>  to postnatal day  <dig> . y-axis: expression level measured in tpm . d qrt-pcr expression data demonstrating a crossover tss switching events between e <dig> and p <dig>  x-axis: time at e <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig> y-axis: expression level measured in rq 




lastly, among the genes with the most significant tss switching events, we have discovered a crossover tss switching event where protein function is highly affected in the contactin-associated protein-like  <dig>  – a gene encodes a member of the neurexin family which functions as cell adhesion molecules and receptors in neurons. the two tss sites, that lead to the transcription of two ncbi-validated mrna refseqs, are more than  <dig> million bp apart in the genome. mrnas that originate from the two tss sites differ by more than 6000 bp and consist of the first  <dig> exons of the long mrna – only  <dig> exons at the 3′ end of the long form mrna  are present in the short form . the cntnap <dig> protein, in its long isoform , contains  <dig> amino acids and many functional domains including one f5/ <dig> type c domain, two epidermal growth factor repeats domains, four laminin g domains and a tm domain. the short protein isoform of cntnap <dig> , which has  <dig> amino acids has only two of the eight functional domains remaining, the last laminin g domain and the tm domain . in the genepaint database, a probe specific to the long isoform of cntnap <dig> was used, and it is indicated that the long isoform is primarily expressed in the rhombic lip of the cerebellum at e <dig>  . according to our prediction  and qrt-pcr results, cntnap <dig> undergoes a crossover tss switching between e <dig>  and p <dig> . the highly differentiated protein isoforms of cntnap <dig> suggest the gene’s temporal shift in protein functions during cerebellar development where a truncated form is made specifically in the during early embryonic stages.fig.  <dig> alternative tsss in contactin associated protein-like  <dig>  and experimental validation of its crossover switching events with real-time pcr. a schematic dna structure of cntnap <dig>  alternative mrna variants and truncated protein structure of the short isoform. b in situ expression of cntnap <dig> in mouse cerebellum at e <dig>  . c heliscopecage expression data for the two alternative tsss during cerebellar development. x-axis: time, from embryonic day  <dig>  to postnatal day  <dig> . y-axis: expression level measured in tpm . d qrt-pcr expression data demonstrating a crossover tss switching events between e <dig>  and p <dig>  x-axis: time at e <dig>  e <dig> and p <dig>  y-axis: expression level measured in rq 




discussion
high prevalence of alternative tsss in mammalian genomes
in this study, we have identified  <dig> genes  that exhibit differential tss usage during cerebellar development. these findings are in line with previous studies and indicate that tss switching events are common and can play an important role in the diversity of the cerebellar transcriptome during development . furthermore, we have identified  <dig> crossover tss switching events which suggests an alteration in the dominant tss over time. since the alternative mrna isoforms could be translated into functionally different products, a crossover switching event suggests that one gene can play different roles at different time points in development.

alternative usage of multiple tsss of one gene is common in mammalian genomes. it is a key mechanism to increase mrna and protein diversity since multiple mrnas from a single gene can encode distinct protein isoforms with different functions . recent studies suggest that about half of the mouse genes have multiple alternative promoters  <cit> . for example, alternative promoters have been identified in >20% of genes in encode  regions  <cit> . other genomic studies also found more than a quarter of human genes having multiple active promoters . the complex transcriptional regulation of alternative promoter usage has been identified in several genes  <cit> . furthermore, in some genes, such as tumor protein p <dig>  and guanine nucleotide binding protein , alternative promoters were shown to be activated or silenced  <cit> . however, the focus of previous studies has been the tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of alternative promoters; the temporal aspect of alternative promoter usage during cerebellar development has been overlooked. our analyses focused on the switching usage of alternative promoter in the mouse cerebellum, and this is the first systematic study of alternative promoter usage in the development of the mouse cerebellum.

temporal regulation of alternative tss associated with developmental processes in the cerebellum
alternative tsss reflect different promoter regions that can be used for tissue-specific and/or temporal-specific expression. for example, albumin in hepatocytes has several cis-acting elements that recruit different sets of trans-acting factors, which enable spatial, temporal and dynamics regulation of the transcription of albumin mrna  <cit> . in this study, we have identified  <dig> crossover tss switching events in  <dig> genes. thus, in ~20% of genes there is more than one promoter that is used dominantly during cerebellar development. functional annotation analysis for these genes revealed go terms that are expected to be associated with alternative promoter usage, such as “alternative splicing” and “splicing variants”, as well go terms that point to processes where promoter switching might play a role during development, such as “phosphoprotein”, “cytoskeleton organization” and “neuron projection”. phosphoproteins are involved in the post-translational regulatory process phosphorylation, in which a phosphate group is added to a peptide. the physical binding of phosphoproteins, such as fas-activated serine/threonine phosphoprotein , to regulators of alternative splicing has been evidenced by yeast two-hybrid screening and biochemical analyses  <cit> . furthermore, the sensory, motor, integrative, and adaptive functions of neuron projections are associated with the development of a growth cone, which is composed primarily of an actin-based cytoskeleton  <cit> . one of the cytoskeleton remodeling genes, disabled- <dig> , has multiple isoforms, as a result of alternative splicing  <cit> , that are activated by tyrosine-phosphorylation and play important roles in neuronal positioning by recruiting a wide range of sh <dig> domain-containing proteins and activates downstream protein cascades through the reelin signalling pathway  <cit> . deficiency in dab <dig> pathway resulted in a delay in the development of purkinje cell dendrites and dysregulation of the synaptic markers of parallel fiber and climbing fiber in the cerebellum  <cit> .

the dominant tss usually switches gradually over time so that only  <dig> % of crossover tss switching are detected at adjacent time points . however, more than a quarter of the changes at adjacent time points occur between e12-e <dig> . this time period coincides with key developmental events such as cell specification, cell proliferation of granule cell precursors in the rhombic lip, as well as the initiation of cells migrating toward the anterior end of the cerebellum  <cit> .

alternative tss as post-transcriptional control during cerebellar development
alternative tsss can produce distinct mrna isoforms that have different rna stability and translational efficiency of the mrna isoforms. for example, vascular endothelial growth factor a  mrna stability is regulated through alternative initiation codons that are generated through usage of alternative promoters  <cit> . we found that two alternative forms of anp32a are dominantly expressed at different developmental stages in the cerebellum. the long form has  <dig> additional amino acids on the n-terminus compared to the short form. this difference could alter anp32a protein stability and distribution. the role of anp32a during cerebellar development is not known, but it is found to be involved in a variety of cellular processes in both nucleus and cytoplasm, including signaling, apoptosis, protein degradation, and morphogenesis  <cit> . moreover, anp32a is known to be a key component of the inhibitor of acetyltransferase  complex in the nucleus, involved in regulating chromatin remodeling or transcription initiation  <cit> . there are suggestions that anp32a may play important roles in the brain as the level of anp32a is increased in alzheimer’s disease and may be involved in the regulatory mechanism of affecting tau phosphorylation and impairing the microtubule network and neurite outgrowth  <cit> .

alternative tsss can also be a means of producing mrna isoforms with various mrna stability and translation efficiency. in the case of gpc <dig>  we found that its two forms only differ in mrna sequence that could affect its mrna stability and translation efficiency. gpc <dig> is most abundantly expressed in the ovary, liver, and kidney, with low level expression in the nervous system  <cit> . in mice, gpc <dig> is critical to modulating the response of the growth plate to thyroid hormones  <cit> ; while in human, mutations in the region where gpc <dig> resides on chromosome  <dig> are associated with defects in endochondral ossification and cause recessive omodysplasia  <cit> .

functional importance of alternative tss during cerebellar development
alternative tsss can produce protein isoforms with distinct n-termini; this in turn would lead to alterations in protein function. an example would be the secreted and membrane-bound isoforms of mammalian fos-responsive gene, fit- <dig>  that are generated and regulated by a pair of alternative promoters  <cit> . we found that during cerebellar development, the short form of cntnap <dig> loses most of the functional domains present in the long form – with only the last laminin g domain retained. cntnap <dig> has been found to play a role in the local differentiation of the axon into distinct functional subdomains  <cit> . the function of cntnap <dig> short form during cerebellar development is still to be investigated, but the lack of most functional domains suggest its role as a transcriptional suppressor – through mechanism such as non-sense mediated decay  <cit> ; or a functional competitor for the same domain binding region  <cit> , for cntnap <dig> long form counterpart during early development. during postnatal development, the short form of cntnap <dig> ceases to be expressed and the long  form is maintained at a steady level. cntnap <dig> is strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders, shown in previous studies . a knockout mouse for cntnap <dig> targeted the gene’s first exon and completely eliminated the expression of the long form  <cit> , which caused abnormalities in body size, neuronal migration and activity, and behaviour. thus the knockout has been used as an animal model for autism  <cit> . however, the short form of cntnap <dig> should be present in the knockout, and no attention has been directed to the expression of the short form in the knockout. a mutation targeted to the c-terminus would be required to reveal cntnap2’s overall function in considering both its long and short protein isoforms.

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed the cerebellar developmental time course data from the fantom <dig> project and identified  <dig> tss switching events with temporally specific dominant promoters. this is the first study to investigate the prevalence of alternative tss usage during cerebellar development and their potential roles in transcriptional, post-transcriptional and functional regulation.
