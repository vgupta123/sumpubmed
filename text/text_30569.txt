BACKGROUND
muskelin was originally identified as a molecule required in cellular responses to the extracellular matrix  component thrombospondin- <dig>   <cit> . muskelin overexpression promotes cell attachment to the c-terminus of tsp- <dig> and antisense depletion of muskelin expression leads to reduced cell attachment, cell spreading and cytoskeletal reorganization  <cit> . tsp- <dig> is a member of the thrombospondin  family of widely-expressed, multifunctional ecm proteins  <cit> . tsps secreted by immature astrocytes during embryonic development promote central nervous system  synaptogenesis  <cit> . muskelin transcripts are expressed in different tissues of developing mouse embryos  <cit>  and northern blot analysis as well as rt-pcr detected muskelin transcripts in many adult tissues including brain  <cit> , however whether the synaptogenic effect of tsps involves muskelin function is currently unclear.

a reported direct binding partner of muskelin is the cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  activator, p <dig>  that is abundant in the cns  <cit> , displays highest expression in cerebellum and hippocampus, and partially localizes to synaptophysin-positive synapses  <cit> . in cos cells and lens epithelial cells, coexpression of p <dig> and muskelin recruits intracellular muskelin toward the cell periphery  <cit> , however whether muskelin also localizes at synaptic sites in neurons is presently unknown. notably, overexpression of cdk <dig> and p <dig> resulted in significantly higher rates of synapse formation in a neuroblastoma cell/myotube co-culture system  <cit> , and both the knockout of cdk <dig>  <cit>  as well as the double-knockout of p <dig> and its homologue p <dig> in mice  <cit>  lead to widespread disruption of neuronal migration and brain development. together, these data indicate a critical role for both tsps and cdk5/p <dig> signalling pathways in synapse formation and suggest the hypothesis that muskelin, reported to interact functionally with both systems, might also play a role in synaptogenic mechanisms.

other reported interaction partners of muskelin include the prostaglandin ep <dig> receptor  <cit>  and a protein complex consisting of twa  <dig> and ranbpm  <cit> . at the molecular level, muskelin is a multidomain protein that contains an amino-terminal discoidin domain, an α-helical, lissencephaly- <dig> homology  motif and a c-terminal to lish  motif . the c-terminal half of muskelin contains six repeated kelch motifs  <cit> . each kelch repeat forms a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet that corresponds to a blade in a beta-propeller structure. whereas some kelch-repeat proteins bind to actin, others have unique binding partners  <cit> . muskelin does not directly interact with actin in vitro  <cit>  and although myc-tagged muskelin located at actin-rich plasma membrane regions in lens epithelial cells  <cit> , muskelin has only weak colocalization with actin microfilaments in mouse skeletal myoblasts, smooth muscle cells and cos- <dig> cells  <cit> . similar to other kelch repeat proteins, that are known to assemble into dimers or oligomers, muskelin self-associates through a head-to-tail mechanism  <cit> , features which might be important for the proposed functions of muskelin in the reorganization of cytoskeletal elements  <cit> .

our study provides the first comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of muskelin expression in neuronal tissues and at the subcellular level in neurons.

RESULTS
distribution of muskelin transcripts in the rodent central nervous system
to analyze muskelin mrna distribution in the developing mouse central nervous system , we used four independent radioactive probes corresponding to sequences that encoded non-overlapping muskelin sequences   or all domains except the c-terminus  . at embryonic stage e <dig> , prominent hybridization signals indicative of muskelin mrna transcripts were detected in the developing cns . at e <dig> , high levels of muskelin expression were observed in the neuroepithelium of the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and in the thalamus and hypothalamus as shown in high magnification coronal view . additional high expression was observed in the trigeminal ganglia  and dorsal root ganglia . lower levels were also seen in the eye  , and in the spinal cord . specificity of in situ hybridization was controlled by using alternative probes corresponding to different portions of the muskelin coding sequence and by application of sense rna probes . at embryonic stages e <dig>  and e <dig> , mrna was also detectable in the developing cortex, the midbrain, the pons-midbrain region as well as the medulla oblongata and the dorsal root ganglia .

we then performed in situ hybridization around birth using p <dig> tissue. here, the analyses revealed that muskelin mrna transcripts were present in all brain regions, however transcript levels were above average in the hippocampal formation and cerebellum of newborn animals . hybridization signals were clearly detectable in the spinal cord at this stage . thus, our data indicate that muskelin transcripts are abundant in the second half of mouse embryonic development with a widespread distribution throughout the cns.

muskelin has been identified to mediate intracellular responses to thrombospondin- <dig>  however thrombospondins- <dig> and - <dig>  both identified as synaptogenic proteins, are expressed in the embryonic  <cit>  and postnatal brain but become downregulated in the adult cns  <cit> . in contrast, thrombospondin- <dig>  is highly expressed in the adult cns  <cit> . we therefore also analyzed muskelin transcripts at adult stages and performed in situ hybridization on tissue derived from p <dig> mice. muskelin transcripts were prominent throughout the brain and notably displayed significantly strong signals in the adult hippocampal formation and the adult cerebellum . these data suggest that muskelin might play additional, as yet unidentified, roles in neurons together with other thrombospondins or unrelated proteins.

distribution of muskelin protein in the adult brain
we next raised a muskelin-specific antibody against the muskelin n-terminus  to analyze whether the observed mrna distribution corresponds to the protein distribution pattern of muskelin in brain. western blot analysis revealed that the newly generated antibody detects both full length muskelin  <cit>  and a previously reported n-terminal muskelin fragment of about  <dig> kda that presumably represents a proteolytic fragment  <cit>  . accordingly, an additional independent muskelin-specific antibody raised in our laboratory, detects both corresponding bands in western blots . as a further control, we expressed a gfp-fusion protein harbouring the n-terminal residues 1– <dig> in cultured hippocampal neurons. this polypeptide includes the muskelin residues used for antibody production. indeed, our antibody recognized gfp-muskelin  with high specificity, as revealed from the punctate colocalization pattern in distal dendrites . in addition, preabsorption controls with gst-muskelin 1– <dig>  which had been used for antibody production, confirmed antibody specificity, as compared to a pre-immune serum control and anti-muskelin immunostaining . furthermore, upon expression of myc-muskelin in hek <dig> cells, both anti-myc and anti-muskelin specifically detected a band of the same mass that was not detectable in mock-transfected control cells . together, we conclude that the newly generated antibody detects muskelin with high specificity.

immunoperoxidase staining of mouse brain sections revealed that muskelin polypeptides are expressed throughout the postnatal brain . similarly, the highest protein expression was found in the hippocampus and cerebellum using the muskelin-specific antiserum, but was not detected by pre-immune serum control stainings. at high power magnification it was obvious that muskelin polypeptides are most prominent in hippocampal pyramidal cells of the stratum pyramidale and are also highly expressed in cells of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer . besides the strong immunoreactivity in nuclei, muskelin also displayed a punctate distribution in stratum oriens and stratum radiatum, which harbour basal and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, respectively . similarly, muskelin puncta were found in the molecular and polymorphic layers of the dentate gyrus. individual cells in the dentate gyrus molecular layer, most likely interneurons, also expressed muskelin . muskelin expression in the cerebellum could be detected in nuclei and cell bodies of granule and purkinje cells with a punctate cluster formation in the molecular layer harbouring purkinje cell dendrites and parallel fiber axons of granule cells . we cannot exclude at this point that muskelin is also expressed in glial cells, however the majority of immunoreactive signal is derived from neurons. together, these data suggest that muskelin localizes to distinct subcellular domains within neurites of mature neurons.

subcellular localization of muskelin in cultured hippocampal neurons
a punctate formation of muskelin immunoreactivity has been previously reported in non-neuronal cells and is suggested to result from head-to-tail interactions of muskelin molecules  <cit> . to address whether muskelin immunoreactive puncta localize to axons and/or dendrites, we performed co-immunostaining with respective marker proteins on cultured hippocampal neurons. double detection of muskelin and microtubule-associated protein  <dig> , a marker for neuronal dendrites  <cit> , revealed muskelin puncta in both proximal and distal dendrites of neuronal cells . furthermore, co-staining of muskelin with the axonal marker protein neurofilament- <dig>   <cit>  or tau confirmed that muskelin puncta also localize to axonal projections . notably, muskelin was often found at the margins of dendrites and axons, suggesting a close association with the plasma membrane . within cell bodies, large numbers of small muskelin puncta were detectable  and, consistent with muskelin interacting with ranbpm  <cit>  a nucleocytoplasmic protein  <cit> , significant amounts of muskelin immunoreactivity localized to neuronal nuclei .

in the context of the hypothesis that muskelin binding partners play functional roles in synaptogenic processes, we aimed to understand whether dendritic muskelin puncta  localize to synapses. costaining of muskelin and the synaptic marker sv <dig>  which labels both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminal boutons  <cit> , revealed that the majority of muskelin puncta locate at non-synaptic positions, however individual puncta were clearly associated with sv2-positive sites, as judged from the precise apposition of fluorescent signals . moreover, preparations of synaptosomes from p <dig> rats that were positive for the postsynaptic marker proteins psd- <dig> and gephyrin, which represent excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively, revealed the presence of muskelin at synapses . a comparison of muskelin in cultured hippocampal neurons at different developmental stages  indicated that muskelin expression reaches detectable levels around div <dig> and increases until div <dig> , a time window when the majority of synaptic contacts in cultured neurons form and mature  <cit> . together, these data suggest that muskelin can in principle locate at synaptic membrane specializations and are consistent with the synaptic role of muskelin's direct binding partner p <dig>  <cit> .

subcellular distribution of muskelin upon differential centrifugation of whole brain extracts
in non-neuronal cells, muskelin has been reported to distribute to membranes as well as to the cytosol  <cit> . to clarify whether brain muskelin co-fractionates with membrane structures, we undertook differential centrifugation of adult rodent whole brain extract. western blot analysis of individual cell fractions revealed that the signal representing full-length muskelin was present in p <dig> pellets that contain nuclei and remaining intact cells . furthermore, p <dig> pellets, representing the plasma membrane fraction  <cit> , and p <dig> pellets, consisting of small membranes and large vesicular structures  <cit> , contained prominent amounts of muskelin. notably, muskelin was found in p <dig> pellets representing small vesicles and large protein complexes, however was barely detectable in the remaining cytoplasmic fractions s <dig> and s <dig>  specificity of the antiserum used for analysis was controlled in western blot experiments using pre-immune serum . we also used psd- <dig> detection as a control, since this protein has been previously analysed upon subcellular fractionation  <cit>  and is known to be enriched at postsynaptic sites   <cit>  and at intracellular cargo vesicles   <cit> . together, these data suggest that the distinct subcellular localization of muskelin in neurons is due to associations with either membranes and/or intracellular protein complexes.

discussion
we have analysed the expression of muskelin in brain. our main findings are: i), muskelin is expressed throughout the central nervous system with highest expression in the adult hippocampus and cerebellum; ii), muskelin localizes to the neuronal nucleus as well as to axonal and dendritic projections, including synaptic sites; iii), muskelin cofractionates with both membrane-enriched fractions and fractions containing protein complexes.

muskelin was identified as a molecule required in cellular responses to tsp- <dig>  consistently, during mouse embryonic development, muskelin expression overlaps with the expression pattern of tsp- <dig> in brain  <cit> . however, transcripts of tsp- <dig> and of other tsp family members are strongly downregulated during the late phases of development and early adulthood  <cit> , whereas widespread muskelin expression persists. in contrast, tsp- <dig> was found to be expressed in adult cerebellar purkinje cells  <cit>  and tsp- <dig> was detected in both the adult hippocampus and cerebellum  <cit> . these observations suggest that, besides a functional interaction of muskelin with tsp- <dig>  muskelin might mediate other roles in neurons, independent of tsp- <dig> or other tsps. for instance, the reported muskelin binding partner p <dig> in combination with its molecular target cdk <dig>  are candidate proteins that potentially impact on synaptogenesis by promoting rates of synapse formation  <cit> .

in accordance with a possible role at neuronal membrane specializations,  <cit>  our muskelin-specific antibody detected muskelin in a punctate distribution in cell somata, axons and dendrites, many of which were close to the plasma membrane. confirming this observation, differential centrifugation revealed the presence of muskelin in membrane fractions. counterstaining with a synapse marker and analysis of synaptosomes showed that a fraction of muskelin associates with synaptic contacts, suggesting that muskelin might participate in synaptogenic actions  <cit>  and/or the p39/cdk <dig> system  <cit> .

besides a widespread distribution of muskelin puncta in cell somata, axons and dendrites, the protein displayed prominent localization to neuronal nuclei. interaction of muskelin with ranbpm  <cit> , a polypeptide that locates to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm  <cit>  is in agreement with this observation. whether muskelin, which is present in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, is subject of nucleocytoplasmic transport is currently unknown. however, a role for muskelin in transport reactions is not unlikely, as the protein contains the lish and ctlh domains, that in certain other proteins are known to interact with molecular motors of the dynein family  <cit> , a microtubule-dependent recruitment system.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study provides the first comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of muskelin expression in neuronal tissue and at the subcellular level in neurons. it reports a newly generated muskelin-specific antibody suitable for immunostaining and western blotting and indicates highest muskelin expression levels in hippocampus and cerebellum. at the subcellular level, muskelin is identified in a punctate distribution throughout the neuron, including synaptic sites, and also displays nuclear localization. upon cell fractionation, muskelin is further enriched in fractions containing membranes and large protein complexes. the presented data generate an important point of departure to initiate functional studies in neurons in order to understand the role of a protein that appears to be at a critical interface between binding partners that are functionally involved in synaptogenesis, transport and nuclear processes.
