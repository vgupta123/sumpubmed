BACKGROUND
huanglongbing  is one of the most serious diseases of citrus and causes great losses in the citrus industry worldwide. it has been reported that since  <dig>  hlb has cost florida’s economy an estimated $ <dig>  billion in lost revenues and  <dig>  jobs by reducing orange juice production  <cit> . hlb is associated with three species of fastidious and phloem-limited α-proteobacteria in the genus ‘candidatus liberibacter’: ‘ca. liberibacter asiaticus’ , ‘ca. liberibacter africanus’, and ‘ca. liberibacter americanus’  <cit> , of which las is the only species in the usa. although hlb resistant citrus varieties are being developed to combat the disease, it will likely take over 10 years to produce and evaluate these resistant varieties in florida  <cit> . since florida citrus trees are already infected, it is essential to develop an efficient treatment to combat hlb in the interim. development of a bactericide or other therapeutic compound would provide an additional tool for the control of hlb.

the microbial communities of leaves are diverse and bacteria, of many genera, are the most abundant inhabitants. it is thought that cell density-dependent signaling may play a role in epiphytic bacterial behavior and that cell-cell signaling may influence bacterial fitness  <cit> . thus, bacterial cells within aggregates or in close proximity may be able to modify their microenvironment by triggering neighboring bacteria to express traits for their benefit. therefore, the composition of the microbial community may be important for the ability of las to cause hlb progression. certain citrus plants within heavily las-infected groves appear to “escape” the disease and remain healthy. it has been hypothesized that these plants, which share a similar growing environment, may have a unique microbial composition  <cit> , indicating that the microbial community in citrus may play a key role in the development of hlb. few reports have described the composition of the bacterial community associated with citrus  <cit> , the effects of the season, or the impact of antibiotic treatments on the microbial communities in planta. thus, the dynamics of the citrus bacterial population are not well characterized.

the introduction of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases revolutionized human medicine. since then, plant pathologists have been interested in their efficacy for controlling plant bacterial diseases. antibiotics have been used to control bacterial diseases of fruit trees and to limit contamination in micropropagation and plant tissue culturing for over 50 years  <cit> . nearly  <dig> antibiotics have been tested for plant disease control but less than  <dig> have been used commercially and, of those, only streptomycin and tetracycline have had significant usage in fruit trees  <cit> . during the 1970s, tetracycline was evaluated by direct injection into the trunks of hlb-affected citrus trees in south africa, china, and indonesia  <cit> . however, this practice was discontinued due to labor costs and phytotoxicity. hlb has also previously been controlled by penicillin carbendazin  <cit> . in an earlier study  <cit> , the combination of penicillin and streptomycin was found to be effective in eliminating or suppressing the las bacterium, and the combination provided a therapeutically effective level of control for a much longer time than when either antibiotic was administered separately.

to increase the throughput of bacterial detection, 16s rrna gene-based phylogenetic analysis has been commonly employed to characterize microbial diversity  <cit> . a high-density 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide microarray, the phylochip™, has recently been developed and effectively used to study bacterial population diversity. it is particularly adept at identifying bacteria in the environment  <cit> , and a recent study on the bacterial diversity in hlb-affected citrus used the phylochip™ g <dig> and 16s rrna gene cloned libraries  <cit> . the updated phylochip™ generation  <dig>  includes  <dig>  million probes, the inclusion of strain specific probe sets, the ability to detect over  <dig>  operational taxonomic units , and over  <dig>  sequences in the reference database, which is over  <dig> times greater than that for the phylochip™ g <dig>  <cit> . here, we used the phylochip™ g <dig> array to explore the differences in the relative abundance and phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities associated with hlb-affected citrus plants in the field over a growing season and those treated with antibiotic combinations.

RESULTS
dynamic variations of the bacterial community in hlb-affected field citrus
the most prevalent bacterial phylum in citrus leaves in october  <dig> was proteobacteria with an average of  <dig>  otus out of  <dig>  otus . the next most prevalent phylums were the firmicutes  and the actinobacteria  . the number of otus in the bacteriodetes decreased at a statistically significant level  between october  <dig> and april  <dig>  and that difference appeared to be concentrated in the class of flavobacteria. while the phylum proteobacteria itself remained at 44% of the bacterial community, the number of otus in the α-proteobacterial and β-proteobacterial classes decreased significantly . among the α-proteobacteria, the orders rhizobiales  and sphingomonadales  had decreased otus, and among the β-proteobacteria the order burkholderiales had decreased otus . while the number of otus in the γ-proteobacteria as a class increased, they decreased in the order pseudomonadales . the increase in the γ-proteobacterial class was statistically significant, and the difference appears concentrated in the enterobacteriales . this was the only member of the bacterial community to show an increase in the number of otus in april  <dig> over october  <dig>  the total otus for all phyla had dropped to 67% of the october  <dig> level.

in the period from april  <dig> to october  <dig>  many of the bacterial phyla that had a decrease in otus during the proceeding period began to recover. actinobacteria, firmicutes, and spirochaetes all had increased numbers of otus, and as a percentage of total otus they had all surpassed their october  <dig> levels. proteobacteria was still the most abundant phylum but it represented only 39% of the total otus in october  <dig>  the β-proteobacterial class had significantly more otus  as did the order burkholderiales . the number of otus in the γ-proteobacterial class decreased significantly , and this difference appears concentrated in the order enterobacteriales . while the bacterial otu levels appeared to be trending upward, by october of  <dig> the overall abundance of bacteria was still only 72% of the october  <dig> level.

las bacterium in hlb-affected citrus treated with antibiotic combinations
the dynamic variations of las bacterial titers from august  <dig> to october  <dig> at the ushrl farm, fort pierce, fl are presented in figure  <dig>  the results showed that the las bacterial population fluctuated throughout the year in hlb-affected citrus plants with or without antibiotic treatments. the highest las bacterial titers  were observed in december  <dig>  and the lowest las bacterial titers  were recorded in april  <dig>  this variation generally coincided with hlb-symptoms in the field. there were no significant differences among the antibiotic treatments and the water control before the initial applications in august  <dig>  two months after the initial applications, significant differences  existed between the antibiotic treatments and the controls. by april  <dig>  the titers had decreased by more than 13-fold in the water control, 259-fold in the ko treated citrus and 97-fold in the ps treated citrus. the hybscore of otu <dig>  which represented candidatus liberibacter from phylochip™ g <dig>  coincided with the las bacterial titers detected by qpcr . hybscores averaged  <dig> ± <dig>  in the untreated trees  compared to  <dig> ± <dig>  and  <dig> ± <dig> in the hlb-affected trees treated with ko and ps, respectively. hybscores were the lowest in april  <dig> when the hlb-bacterial population was also at its lowest level .

bacterial community structure and diversity
the phylochip™ g <dig> array was used to gain insights into the structural composition and diversity of bacteria in the leaf midrib from hlb-affected citrus treated with antibiotic combinations . of the  <dig>  otus from our field citrus samples found on the phylochip™ g <dig>  a total of  <dig>   were detected in our antibiotic treated field samples. the number of otus found per treatment  and sampling time point  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . in total,  <dig> phyla were detected, of which five phyla had  <dig> or more otus, proteobacteria , firmicutes , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes  and cyanobacteria . proteobacteria were still dominant in the bacterial populations after treatments. in trees receiving the antibiotic combinations ko and ps, the average otus over sampling time points accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of the treated populations, while they represented  <dig> % of the control population. proteobacteria were also dominant in the bacterial population at all sampling time points. the average otus in the antibiotic treatments accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the bacterial population in october  <dig>  april  <dig>  and october  <dig>  respectively. when compared to the bacterial populations in the leaves of trees receiving the water control treatment, the bacteroidete population decreased  by  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the leaves of trees receiving the ko and ps treatments, respectively .

the phylochip data indicated a change in the community profile over the sampling time points and showed fewer unique otus in populations subjected to antibiotic treatments . the lowest number of otus was detected in april  <dig> after the antibiotics had been applied four times . the phylum bacteriodetes, and specifically the class flavobacteria, significantly decreased . while the phylum proteobacteria did not decrease, both the classes α- and β-proteobacteria did decrease significantly . otus within the order of rhizobiales and the family of rhizobiaceae were significantly decreased by the antibiotic treatments. shannon’s and simpson’s indices both revealed greater diversity in the water control , indicating that antibiotic treatments lead to lower phylum diversity.

the proportions of otus for the most highly represented families  showed a large variation in the number of otus detected in the comamonadaceae, staphylococcaceae, corynebacteriaceae, and flavobacteriaceae families. in accordance with the las bacterial titers, the amount of otus in comamonadaceae significantly decreased in april  <dig> when compared to the other sampling time points ; however, the amount of otus in the enterobacteriaceae and aquabacteriaceae families significantly increased.

specific otus associated with the antibiotic treatments and sampling time points
principal coordinate analysis  based on the weighted unifrac distances between samples was performed with phylochip community data sets, and the results suggested that there were significant differences among the treatments and the sampling time points. the  <dig> otus selected with filter- <dig>  which includes otus present in samples from one treatment but not detected in any samples of the other treatments, separated the antibiotic combinations  and the control group . there were eight otus  in the ko treatment, three in the ps treatment  and six in the water control . when compared with the antibiotic resistance genes database  <cit> , three oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria  were found in the ko treatment . no antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in the ps treatment. prediction analysis for microarrays  identified bacillus otu <dig> within firmicutes to have increased abundance in the control samples compared to the antibiotic treatments. a total of  <dig> otus with filter- <dig>  based on abundance metrics, partitioned the samples into distinct groups corresponding to sampling time points. using binary metrics,  <dig> otus selected with filter- <dig> were found in 100% of the samples from one time point and were consistently absent in other time point samples. pam also identified nine γ-proteobacterial otus  with increased abundance levels in april  <dig> samples compared to samples collected in october  <dig> and october  <dig>  and one sphingomonadaceae, otu <dig>  with an increased abundance level in october  <dig> .

discussion
the high-density 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide microarray, the phylochip™, is employed to study bacterial population diversity, and it is effective for identifying bacteria in the environment  <cit> . the phylochip™ g <dig> array used in this study contains over  <dig>  otus representing all demarcated bacterial and archaeal orders  <cit> . our results revealed the presence of a total of  <dig>  bacterial otus in  <dig> phyla for the field citrus leaf midribs, but no archaea were detected in any of the samples.

the bacterial population of citrus leaves on trees that are asymptomatic for hlb includes planctomycetes, verrucomicrobia, proteobacteria, actinobacteria, brc <dig>  chlamydiae, chlorobi and acidobacteria  <cit> , with proteobacteria being the dominant phylum. in addition to the above mentioned bacteria, other bacteria, including bacteroidetes and chloroflexi, have been found in one citrus grove but not in a second grove  <cit> . thus, the site appears to influence the composition of the microbial community. in leaves of the evergreen southern magnolia tree proteobacteria were also the most populous bacteria, accounting for 53-80% of identified 16s rrna gene sequences, followed by bacteriodetes , acidobacteria and actinobacteria  <cit> . the month of sampling significantly influenced the phylogenetic compositions of the bacterial population, indicating a seasonal fluctuation in bacterial communities  <cit> . seasonal variations in the epiphytic populations of bacteria have also been documented in the olive  <cit> . thus, there appears to be both spatial and temporal variations in leaf microbial communities.

citrus leaves can support a variety of microbes. the phylochip™ analysis in a previous study discovered  <dig> orders of bacteria in  <dig> phyla  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> phyla were revealed using the phylochip™ g <dig> array. however, the seasonal variation in the microbial population of citrus has not been extensively studied. the annual fluctuation of endophytic bacteria in citrus variegated chlorosis  affected citrus showed significant seasonal variations. yet, as in our study, proteobacteria was constantly the dominant phylum of bacteria recovered with the α-proteobacterial and the γ-proteobacterial class vying for prevalence. the α-proteobacterial class’ methylobacterium spp. was the most populous at three  of the four time points and the γ-proteobacterial class’ p. agglomerans was the most populous at the final time point   <cit> .

the bacterial diversity of hlb-affected citrus leaves was analyzed only once previously using the phylochip™ g <dig>  the bacterial community included proteobacteria , bacteroidetes , actinobacteria , chlamydiae , firmicutes , tm <dig> , verrucomicrobia , and dictyoglomi   <cit> . in the present study, we also identified proteobacteria , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes , verrucomicrobia , and firmicutes ; however, we identified several other phyla . in the former study the community structure was different between the two groves analyzed; thus, our results from a separate location are not atypical.

prediction analysis for microarrays  identified ten γ-proteobacterial otus  with increased abundance levels in the april  <dig> samples compared to samples collected in october of  <dig> and  <dig>  the abundance of these otus appears to be seasonally driven since there is no statistical difference between samples receiving the water control and the antibiotic treatments. these are all members of the large enterobacteriaceae family of gram-negative bacteria. some members of this family produce endotoxins that reside in the cell cytoplasm and are released upon cell death with the disintegration of the cell wall. the roles of these endophytic bacteria in hlb development remains to be investigated.

to understand the role of las in hlb progression, it may be important to separate the temporal changes in the microbial community from the changes caused by or associated with hlb. these seasonal changes have been seen not just in the surface phyllosphere but also in the internal tissues as well. bacterial populations in the xylem undergo temporal variations in shade trees  <cit> . in grape vines it has been shown that the endophytic community is similar in healthy plants and plants with undetectable levels of phytoplasmas, but it is different in recovered plants  <cit> . this reorganization of the bacterial community could indicate direct competition between the infective agent and the endophytic bacteria. it could also be the effect of the plant defense response selecting different strains to adapt to new niches. in addition, the modification of the quantitative levels of some bacteria by the infection could alter the relative bacterial proportions. after antibiotic treatments, proteobacteria, firmicutes, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were dominant in the bacterial populations. the phylochip™ g <dig> indicated that the otu <dig>  representing “candidatus liberibacter”, was detected in all treatments, but had a lower hybscore in the antibiotic treatments, which corresponded with the titers of the las bacterium. in our previous reports  <cit> , penicillin alone and its combinations with streptomycin were effective in eliminating or suppressing the las bacterium in greenhouse plants. in this research, trunk-injections of the antibiotic combinations of penicillin and streptomycin, or kasugamycin and oxytetracycline, suppressed the las bacterium in hlb-affected citrus in the field throughout the growing season. las bacterial titers were significantly lower in the ps- or ko-treated hlb-affected trees compared to untreated trees  two months after the initial applications in august  <dig> . the las bacterial titers increased in the ko-treatment, but remained at a significantly lower level in the ps-treated trees  for two months  after the antibiotic treatments ceased in august  <dig>  a graft-based chemotherapy analysis of streptomycin and kasugamycin, two amnioglycoside antibiotics, revealed that they were not very effective in suppressing the las bacterium when each antibiotic was applied alone . the effectiveness of penicillin or oxytetracycline against the las bacterium was enhanced due to the use of antibiotic combinations  <cit> . because tetracycline is bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal, it is necessary to frequently apply oxytetracycline for continuous suppression of hlb  <cit> . thus, it is important to use the antibiotics in combination to decrease the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and to improve the efficacy against the bacteria  <cit> . in this experiment three otus were identified, by searching the antibiotic resistance genes database  <cit> , as oxytetracycline resistant genes but no penicillin resistant genes emerged. this research may assist regulatory agencies in evaluating the potential for applying antibiotic treatments in the future to larger grove settings.

the temporal and antibiotic-dependent significant differences in the bacterial community have implications not only for biocontrol but also for phytopathology. the composition of the bacterial community may strongly influence the establishment of antagonistic bacteria at appropriate times during plant development or the growing season. by understanding the composition of, and variation in, the bacterial community of citrus we may be able to time hlb control treatments better and to harness the plants own natural microbial population. this will help establish better management and treatment strategies.

CONCLUSIONS
using the phylochip™ g <dig> array, the bacterial composition and community structure in hlb-affected citrus plants during a growing season and while being treated with antibiotic combinations ps and ko were studied. we identified proteobacteria as the major phylum in citrus leaf midribs from the ushrl farm in fort pierce, fl. while proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria throughout the growing season, the α-proteobacterial and β-proteobacterial classes decreased significantly  from october  <dig> to april  <dig> and the γ-proteobacteria as a class increased . from april  <dig> to october  <dig> the β-proteobacterial class had significantly more otus  and the number of otus in the γ-proteobacterial class had decreased significantly . these temporal fluctuations in the bacterial population may affect the microenvironment; thus, making the composition of the microbial community an important factor in the ability of las to cause hlb progression. both antibiotic treatments, ps and ko, resulted in decreases in the number of otus in the dominant phyla, except cyanobacteria, and the over-all diversity of bacteria decreased from  <dig>  otus to  <dig>  otus by april  <dig>  the antibiotic treatments resulted in significantly lower las bacterial titers  and hybridization scores. however, within the proteobacteria, ten otus representing the class γ-proteobacteria increased in abundance after four months of treatment, when the las bacterium was at its lowest level in the hlb-affected citrus field plants. antibiotics altered the taxonomic composition of the bacterial community and reduced their diversity while suppressing the las bacterium. our data revealed that las levels fluctuated temporally, as part of the over-all bacterial population dynamics, and as a response to the antibiotic treatments.
