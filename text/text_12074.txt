BACKGROUND
the cacta transposons are characterized by terminal inverted repeats , target-site duplications of conserved length and transposition through a dna intermediate. one of the best genetically characterized transposons is the suppressor-mutator  also named enhancer  system of z. mays  <cit> . it consists of two components, the spm/en element that is autonomous with regard to excision, transposition and integration. the defective spm  or inhibitor  elements are non-autonomous, generally internal deletion derivatives, that transpose only if an active spm/en is present elsewhere in the genome to provide the trans-active suppressor and mutator functions of the element  <cit> .

the spm/en element was molecularly characterized  <cit>  and shown to be  <dig>  kb with capacity to encode at least two alternatively spliced transcripts of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb. the  <dig>  kb transcript was  <dig> times more abundant than the  <dig>  kb mrna and contains  <dig> exons of the tnpa gene. in addition to the multiple exons of the tnpa gene, the  <dig>  kb tnpd transcript  contains the large orf from the intron- <dig> region at the 5'-end of the element. the larger tnpd transcript  encoded a putative transposase required for the excision/integration in a transposition event whereas tnpa codes for a putative protein of  <dig> kd that functions as a dna binding protein  <cit> . the tnpa protein recognizes the subterminal repeats, which act as cis-determinants for the excision and transposition of the spm/en element  <cit> . the suppressor function of spm/en was also assigned to the tnpa protein  <cit> . the binding of tnpa to subterminal domains of defective spm/en elements has been shown to create a steric block to the advancement of rna polymerase, resulting in transcripts terminated prematurely  <cit> . both proteins, tnpd and tnpa, are absolutely required for transposition of spm/en  <cit> . the proteins may be provided in trans from active autonomous  elements to allow the transposition of non-autonomous  elements, as long as they retain the cis-acting target sequences. in addition, tnpa can act as a positive and negative regulator of its own activity  <cit> .

a  <dig> kb tam <dig> cacta-element of antirrhinum majus also encodes two transcripts with somewhat parallel organization as the spm/en element, an abundant  <dig>  kb and a low abundance 5-kb mrna  <cit> . the  <dig>  kb transcript of tam <dig>  is also pasted together from distant exons as is the tnpa mrna of spm/en; however, they have no sequence similarity. on the other hand, the larger transcripts of both elements containing sequences of the open reading frames , share significant  amino acid homology  <cit>  in the orf region that is found in the large intron- <dig> of the maize spm/en element. similarly, previously reported non-autonomous cacta-tgm-elements of soybean feature a portion of an open reading frame 39% similar to the tnpd gene of spm/en  <cit> . the conservation of these sequences suggests a common function of these gene products. it has been proposed but not proven that tnpd may interact with the conserved 13-bp tirs and cleave the transposon termini  <cit> .

other active or full length cacta elements have been isolated and characterized to some extent from several other species including, tpn <dig> from ipomoea nil  <cit> ,tdc <dig> from daucus carota  <cit> , psi from petunia hybrida  <cit> , candystripe <dig>  from sorghum bicolor  <cit> , atenspm <dig>  from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , tpo <dig> from lolium perenne  <cit>  and tamrsa <dig> of a. majus  <cit> .

only deletion derivative, non-autonomous cacta family members  and tgm-express <dig>  have been studied to date from soybean  <cit> . we recently identified the t locus in soybean that controls the tawny color of the trichome hairs on the plant leaves and stems as encoding a flavonoid 3' hydroxylase gene   <cit> . the stable gray t* allele, that was derived from a single mutable plant displaying both tawny and gray trichomes on the same plant, appeared to contain a large insertion that was not amplifiable by standard pcr conditions. using pcr conditions designed to amplify large fragments, we here report finding a large  <dig>  kb cacta transposon  inserted in intron- <dig> of the f3'h gene, thus defining the novel t* mutant allele. tgmt* had imperfect  <dig> bp cacta tirs and asymmetric subterminal repeats, and created a three base duplication upon insertion.

comparison of the tgmt* subterminal repeats to those of other reported cacta elements of soybean and other plant species revealed wide divergence of the repeated motifs and the existence of two distinct cacta transposon families in soybean. at the same time, all elements' subterminal repeated motifs had some regions of similarity. in addition, tgmt* encodes a  <dig>  kb complex gene- <dig> with a transposase and a presumed dna-binding function. a large precursor transcript encoded a transposase with tnp <dig> and tnp <dig> domains. smaller alternatively spliced transcripts  had little similarity to other cacta transposon mosaic transcripts such as tnpa of maize and they likely encode a distinct type of binding protein that recognizes the soybean tgmt* subtype of subterminal inverted repeats. thus, in addition to broadening our understanding of the cacta transposon's integral components, these findings point to tgmt* as a potentially autonomous cacta element isolated from soybean. significantly, the data also clearly demonstrate diversification of the subterminal repeats of cacta families within a species such as soybean , as well as between species as has been noted before for tgm <dig>  en- <dig>  and tam <dig>  for example. this observation is substantiated not only by the divergence of the subterminal inverted repeats between the tgmt* and tgm1-tgm <dig> type elements, but also by the divergence  between the tnp2-containing orf of tgmt* and the previously characterized partial tnp2-containing orf in the tgm <dig> element. thus, our data point to considerable within-species divergence of the cacta element families. whether these subtypes of element families originated before or after the origin of soybean as a distinct species is unknown. bioinformatic analyses of these elements in many whole genome sequences within the legume family and other dicotyledonous plants in future years may shed light on how rapidly the dna in the subterminal repeats and the tnpa-like exons that putatively recognize these subterminal repeats may coevolve and diversify both within and between species.

RESULTS
isolation of a large dna insertion in the novel mutant allele with gray trichomes 
in a previous study in which the t locus of soybean was identified as the flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase gene , we reported the partial genomic sequences of three f3'h alleles of the soybean lines, williams  <dig> , xb22a  and its gray trichome isoline,  <dig> . we postulated that a large intron existed in the 5' region of the f3'h genes and that it prevented pcr amplification of the contiguous full length f3'h genomic sequence using standard methods. in order to obtain the full sequence of soybean f3'h, we isolated a bac clone from cultivar pi <dig> with the t/t genotype. the  <dig> kb of bac sequence  revealed a  <dig>  kb intron in the f3'h gene. this information was utilized to synthesize primers intended to amplify the promoter and intron- <dig> genomic regions of f3'h alleles in xb22a,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and williams  <dig> soybean lines . the ~ <dig> kb promoter region of f3'h in all those lines was identical although there were several differences from the pi <dig> cultivar. the  <dig>  kb intron- <dig> sequence was also determined for the f3'h alleles of williams  <dig> , xb22a  and the stable gray-trichome isoline,  <dig> . the three f3'h full length genomic sequences: williams  <dig> , xb22a  and its isoline  <dig>  were entered in genbank with accession numbers, eu <dig>  eu <dig> and eu <dig> respectively.

the dramatically differing sizes between the tawny  and gray  trichome f3'h alleles above was found to be due to a  <dig>  kb insertion in intron- <dig> in the  <dig> mutant isoline . pcr amplification of the  <dig>  kb insertion required the use of higher melting temperature oligonucleotide primers  and optimized conditions for la taq polymerase  as described in the methods section. as shown in figure  <dig>  a large fragment of ~ <dig> kb was amplified from genomic dna from both of the stable gray trichome lines  <dig> and  <dig> as well as from the mutable tawny/gray trichome line,  <dig> . the same primers also amplified a smaller  <dig>  kb fragment from the mutable  <dig> line and those lines with the dominant alleles, williams  <dig> and xb22a. the  <dig>  kb fragment is the intron- <dig> portion comprised between the two primers used in the pcr reactions. the insertion maps ~ <dig>  kb to the left of the in663r primer .

cloning and sequencing a  <dig>  kb cacta transposon, tgmt*
the ~ <dig> kb pcr fragment was purified from 1% seaplaque agarose gel with the aid of gelase agarose gel-digesting preparation , cut with hindiii and cloned in a pgem vector. fortunately, two of the resulting clones that hybridized to a labeled probe prepared with an aliquot of the gelase purified  <dig> kb fragment, with sizes  <dig> bp, and  <dig>  bp turned out to be the insertion's borders, each containing portions of intron sequence, a cacta inverted repeat and the adjacent three base target duplication .

a 37-mer reverse primer  designed to the insertion's right border found in the  <dig>  kb clone was paired with the z37f primer upstream of the insertion's left border to amplify a  <dig> kb dna fragment . an attempt at cloning the <dig> kb fragment into the pjazz-oc vector using the bigeasy v <dig>  linear cloning kit from lucigen corp. failed to clone it in one piece but many partial clones ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb were recovered. five different clones were sequenced and assembled to reveal a  <dig>  bp cacta transposable element that was named tgmt* . this sequence was entered in genbank as part of the t* allele genomic sequence from the  <dig> line . previous studies of soybean clones containing cacta ends analyzed seven distinct sequences  ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb that were believed to be portions of deletion derivatives of a larger active element . only tgm <dig> and tgm <dig> sequences had a  <dig> kb segment with 39% similarity to the orf <dig> of maize spm/en transposable element tnpd gene. the larger tgmt* element we have cloned in this report has the capacity to encode all known functions required of an active and autonomous cacta element as will be described later.

molecular structure of tgmt*: terminal and subterminal repeats
sequence analyses revealed features that are conserved among transposable elements of the spm/en family. tgmt* possesses nearly identical  <dig> bp cacta inverted repeats with three reciprocal mismatches and features a three-base-target site duplication, ata. it also contains asymmetric, reiterated direct and inverted sequence motif in the subterminal regions capable of forming  <dig> stem-loop structures in the right border and two in the left border . the largest stem-loop structures were formed by direct and inverted repeated sequence motif  <dig> bp long. this sequence motif could be divided in two sub-motifs, a  <dig> bp motif  present in all  <dig> stem-loop structures and a  <dig> bp motif  that was missing or incomplete in some of the stem-loops. see an alignment of all direct stem repeated sequences  in figure  <dig> 

a similarly complex pattern of stem-loop structures was described for tgm <dig>  <cit> . in this instance the length of the repeated sequence motif  was more uniform . the consensus sequence of these direct repeats from tgm <dig> was compared to the one deduced from tgmt*, tgm-express <dig>  and tgmw4m . surprisingly, the tgm <dig> sequence motif diverged from all three others in  <dig> nucleotide positions highlighted in red in figure  <dig>  the subterminal direct repeat motif of en- <dig> is smaller  and except for a tctta domain its sequence is different from the motif of the soybean tgmt* transposon family  analyzed. the extended sequence divergence of tgm <dig> is intriguing and suggests the existence of a second cacta transposon family in soybean. this variability of subterminal repeats extends to other motifs reported. figure  <dig> shows an alignment of subterminal repeats from  <dig> transposon sequences emphasizing both, their divergence and slight commonality. they all seem to have a gc rich and an at rich portion. whether or not these are recognition sites for the dna-binding proteins remains to be determined.

molecular prediction of tgmt* open reading frames
softberry- fgenesh gene prediction web-based algorithms using medicago truncatula as training set  found one gene with  <dig> exons in the negative dna strand relative to the f3'h gene  where tgmt* inserted. thus, all sequence analysis description and depiction of tgmt* gene- <dig> is that of the reverse complement. the predicted gene- <dig> first exon starts at base pair  <dig>  and its polya at  <dig>  bp . this gene could transcribe a  <dig>  bp mrna that would translate a  <dig>  amino acid  product. the derived aa sequence subjected to ncbi non-redundant protein sequence database blast found similarity to many putative cacta transposon proteins. the highest similarities  were to vitis vinifera hypothetical proteins can <dig> and can <dig> over a length of  <dig> and  <dig> aa respectively. the tgmt* predicted protein had two putative conserved domains, a transposase family tnp <dig> domain   located between  <dig> –  <dig> aa and a tnp1/en/spm transposase domain   located at  <dig>  –  <dig>  aa. a search for similar domain architectures with ncbi cdart  found two sequences from oryza sativa   <cit>  to have the most closely related domain architectures. in contrast, the two v. vinifera hypothetical proteins with the highest similarity to tgmt* gene- <dig> product had only one transposase domain, the tnp <dig> domain.

the soybean deletion derivative tgm <dig> transposon sequence  has 79% similarity to the tgmt* sequence stretch from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp and contains the entire tnp <dig> transposase domain. it was previously estimated that tgm <dig> was 39% similar to the orf <dig> of the zea mays en- <dig> transposable element  <cit> .

when we applied softberry- fgenesh gene prediction web-based algorithms using monocot plants as training set  to the autonomous transposable element en- <dig> sequence  <cit> , it predicted one gene with  <dig> exons, an mrna of  <dig>  bp and a protein of  <dig>  aa. a non-redundant protein sequence database blast search with the predicted  <dig>  aa sequence found similarities to other maize transposable elements proteins and identified two transposase domains. one located at 264– <dig> aa, pfam <dig>  transposase_ <dig> transposase family tnp <dig>  and the second at  <dig> – <dig>  aa, pfam <dig>  transposase_ <dig> plant transposase ptta/en/spm family . thus, it appears that the predicted genes from tgmt* and en- <dig> are similar at the 5'end with the tnp <dig> transposase domain at identical location - <dig> aa). in contrast, the aa sequences of the predicted genes beyond the  <dig> aa, diverged significantly with two distinct, non aligned, transposase domains. tgmt* and en- <dig> aa sequence alignment using the "multiple sequence alignment with hierarchical clustering"  program  <cit> , showed the similarities at the 5'end of the proteins with the tnp <dig> domains aligned and  <dig> identical aa's over the first  <dig> aa stretch . the remaining  <dig>  aa of the tgmt* predicted protein had only  <dig> aa identities  to the en- <dig> predicted product and the tnp1/en/spm transposase domain of tgmt* is different and did not align with the ptta/en/spm domain of en- <dig>  this second stretch of the aligned aa sequences included large gaps that would account for the smaller size of en- <dig> predicted gene and its product,  <dig> aa shorter. .

expression of tgmt* gene- <dig> in mutable and stable trichome color soybean isolines
based on the molecular analysis of tgmt* dna sequence with web-based gene prediction algorithms and the extent of the similarity of the predicted gene to the well characterized gene of the en- <dig> autonomous cacta transposable element, it was presumed that tgmt* gene- <dig> should be expressed in soybean lines where the putative autonomous tgmt* element could be active. an initial attempt at determining gene- <dig> expression was a search for rnas hybridizing to gene- <dig> dna probes on rna blots with samples extracted from multiple tissues of four soybean lines varying at the t locus, williams  <dig> , xb22a ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . no clear, significant hybridization was detected in any of the rna blots with any of the tested dna probes which together covered the region of gene- <dig> encoding exons 1– <dig>  with the tnp <dig> and tnp <dig> transposase domains .

these results suggested that if the transposase gene was expressed it did so at very low levels, and thus we opted for the more sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique  to assay gene- <dig> expression. figure  <dig> shows the amplification products obtained using three primer pairs. each pair amplified a different portion of the gene- <dig> region with the tnp <dig> and tnp <dig> domains. the rt-pcr reactions shown were carried out with rnas from three isolines that were derived from a single rogue soybean plant that had shown variegation in trichome color in a field breeding program: xb22a ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the negative controls  were reactions where the cdna synthesis step was allowed in the absence of superscript . interestingly, the  <dig> line with the recessive allele  from which tgmt* was isolated did not appear to express gene- <dig>  in contrast, xb22a  and  <dig>  isolines seem to have retained a putatively active tgmt* expressing the transposase region of gene- <dig>  this differential pattern of rt-pcr amplification amongst the isolines was repeated with several other primer sets tested covering other regions of gene- <dig> . figure  <dig> shows results of additional examples of pcr reactions performed with cdnas synthesized from rna of the mutable isoline  <dig>  and that generated larger or more complex dna fragment patterns. lane  <dig> of figure 7a shows the range of amplification products  obtained with two primers  each at either end of the predicted gene- <dig>  many of the products amplified from cdnas of this mutable line,  <dig> , were cloned and sequenced and the analysis and assembly of the cdna sequences provided a clear picture of tgmt* expression which is shown in figure  <dig>  the location of all primer pairs used in the pcr reactions which results are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> were marked in figure  <dig> with small arrows numbered from 1– <dig>  in certain instances the arrows were placed near the clones  to simplify the diagram.

the sequences of  <dig> cdna fragments were used to map all the exons and introns on the genomic tgmt* sequence. the exon-intron boundaries obey the canonical gt-ag rule  <cit>  in the majority of the cdna clones. see additional files  <dig> and  <dig> where exon sequences of cdna clones have been aligned with the tgmt* genomic sequence. the sizes and locations of the cdna exons are listed in table  <dig> and highlighted in bold are  <dig> of them that are almost identical in size and location to exons predicted by the softberry- fgenesh program. two of the predicted exons  were portions of larger exons in the cloned cdnas . however, predicted exons no.  <dig> and  <dig> towards the 3' end of the gene were not part of the cloned cdnas and since we recovered  <dig> different cdna clones from this region of the gene it can be assume with certainty that predicted exons- <dig> and - <dig> were errors of the fgenesh program. a full length cdna of  <dig>  bp spanning the predicted gene- <dig> could be assembled with all the exon sequences of the cdna clones . most likely, transcripts of this size were synthesized in vivo given the rt-pcr results obtained and the locations of the primers used on the gene sequence .

of most relevance were the sequences of the amplified cdnas with primers at the ends of the gene  because they revealed splicing of the first  <dig> bp  of exon- <dig> with exon- <dig> to generate transcripts  <dig> –  <dig>  kb in size . the splicing of the  <dig> bp of exon- <dig>  ending in ataat, did not occur at the intron-exon junction of exon- <dig> but rather  <dig> bp into intron- <dig> right border, adding the  <dig> bp of intron sequence in the synthesis of mosaic transcripts. the intron- <dig> sequence up-stream of the splice site also ends on ataat, the same motif found up-stream of exon- <dig> splice site ). whether or not this sequence motif is involved in the recognition and splicing mechanism to create the mosaic gene is not known.

the splicing of all the many exons to form the mosaic transcripts as well as the full length precursor transcripts must be cumbersome judging by the multiplicity of related cdnas amplified with a given set of primers  and transcripts amplified with primers  <dig> and  <dig>  cl. 47-43). some of the cdnas retained entire introns such as cl.  <dig> or intron portions in cl.  <dig> and  <dig> . exon- <dig> was spliced out in six of the cdna clones sequenced . this erratic splicing of exons was observed earlier in transcripts from another complex soybean cacta transposon,tgm-express <dig> containing multiple host-gene fragments  <cit> .

nevertheless, a putative full length mosaic cdna of  <dig>  bp was cloned and sequenced . the splice site between exon- <dig>  and exon- <dig> is indicated with an asterisk in figure  <dig>  this mosaic transcript may encode the dna-binding protein that is required for excision of these cacta transposons in soybean in the same fashion tnpa does it for the en- <dig> element of maize. ncbi/blast/blastx  found similarities to some predicted proteins from v. vinifera, arabidopsis and o. sativa in the non-redundant protein database but not to maize. this result supports previous observations that proteins that share little similarity, such as tnpa and tnp <dig>  may have a similar function, that of binding to the subterminal repeats, regions that vary considerably amongst the different cacta transposons  <cit> .

in summary, tgmt* expresses the predicted gene- <dig> in xb22a  and the mutable  <dig>  lines, but not in the stable, gray trichome  <dig>  isoline from which it was cloned. a multiplicity of mrnas, were transcribed from gene- <dig> and the putative largest transcript assembled was  <dig>  bp in length. in addition, mosaic transcripts of different sizes were also synthesized and the largest was  <dig>  bp. the precursor mrna codes for a transposase with a tnp <dig> and tnp <dig> domains in exons- <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the  <dig>  mosaic transcript may encode a dna-binding protein with a function similar to that of tnpa of the maize en- <dig> and tnp <dig> of a. majus tam <dig>  but with very limited amino acid sequence similarity.

redundancy of tgmt*-like sequences in the soybean genome
in order to determine the abundance of tgmt* sequences in the soybean genome, an initial ncbi/blast/blastn search of the nucleotide collection  database optimized for highly similar sequences was run using either the entire  <dig>  bp tgmt* sequence, the  <dig>  bp comprising exon- <dig> through exon- <dig> with the transposases orf <dig> and orf <dig> or the  <dig>  bp starting at exon- <dig> through exon- <dig>  the transposase portion of the element had 84% identity with 98% coverage to a glycine max clone gmw1-45m <dig>  , 75% identity over a 58% coverage to two glycine tomentella clones gtt1-62b <dig>  and gtt1-188p <dig> , 75%identity and 26% coverage to a glycine max clone bac gm_wbb080d , and finally, 76% identity over 17% coverage, to the soybean tgm <dig> transposable element . however, no highly similar sequences were found when the blast search was performed with the second half of gene- <dig> sequence . two additional sequences, one from glycine max cultivar t <dig> dihydroflavonol-4-reductase  <dig>  gene, intron ii and transposon tgmw4m  and a second one from glycine max cultivar t <dig> dihydroflavonol-4-reductase  <dig>  gene, dfr2-w4-dp allele, disrupted promoter region and transposon tgmw4m  had 99% identity to the right and left border of tgmt* over  <dig>  and  <dig> bases, respectively, indicating that these may be deletion derivatives from an element similar to tgmt*.

the search was extended to the 7× draft sequence assembly glyma <dig> from the joint genome inititive . the blastn search with the tgmt* entire sequence , found high level of similarity to  <dig> scaffolds . to determine how many of the  <dig> scaffolds had the transposase and the exons of the mosaic transcript, two blastn searches with the  <dig>  bp  and the  <dig>  bp  were performed. the transposase exons found high similarity  to  <dig> scaffolds while the exons of the mosaic transcript found high similarity  to  <dig> scaffolds. scaffolds with high similarities to both halves of tgmt* gene- <dig> were, scaffold_ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  and _ <dig>  thus, it appears that the soybean genome of cultivar williams has at least  <dig> regions with extensive sequence similarity to tgmt*.

we examined also the regions of similarity in the glyma <dig> soybean genome  to the tgm <dig> transposase sequence  and the equivalent sequence region of tgmt*  using the phytozome glycine max  blast search . we found that the two transposons had similarities to two different sets of scaffolds. tgm <dig> transposase had the highest similarities to scaffolds_ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig> and _ <dig> while tgmt* transposase had the highest similarities to scaffolds_ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig> and _ <dig>  this distinction is additional supporting evidence that tgm <dig> and tgmt* are elements representing two different cacta families in soybean.

a closer examination of the regions of similarities in each one of the scaffolds revealed a large number of partial transposase sequence copies in each one of those scaffolds when the  <dig> bp segment carrying the tnp <dig> domain was used as query. for tgm <dig> scaffolds_ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig> and _ <dig> there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies respectively. for tgmt* scaffolds_ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig>  _ <dig> and _ <dig> there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies respectively. however most of these were relatively short regions not containing the element ends. thus it appears that some regions of the  <dig> bp orf that carries the conserved tnp <dig> domain are widely dispersed in the soybean genome. these observations of moderately high copy number is supported by the intense hybridization signals of varying sizes obtained when this region of the element is used as a probe on genomic dna blots. furthermore, this region also hybridized to many clones when used to screen genomic libraries .

isolation and characterization of a t locus bac clone
as previously discussed, to fully determine the molecular defect of the f3'h allele  with the gray trichome phenotype, it required the cloning of a full length f3'h gene including its promoter. with such an aim, two glycine max bac libraries, one from williams  <dig>  and the other from the more distantly related plant introduction line pi <dig>  were screened. no clones were obtained from the williams  <dig> gmwba library but a bac clone  containing a full length f3'h gene copy was isolated from the pi <dig> library. partial sequence of the f3'h gene in 71b <dig> clone was determined initially from pcr amplified fragments and later confirmed and extended with sequences resulting from a shotgun library of the entire bac clone. these sequences were assembled into three contigs, most likely arranged as shown in figure  <dig> . softberry fgenesh gene prediction and annotation web-based program identified and placed the full f3'h copy  of the gene in contig- <dig>  in addition, two smaller fragments with f3'h similarity  mapped to contig- <dig>  all three f3'h sequences are marked with red arrows in figure  <dig>  all other genes found in 71b <dig> clone were also annotated and their size and relative location in the three contigs are depicted in figure  <dig> and listed in the annotation table  <dig>  as noted, other full copy genes in this bac clone were three located in tandem in contig- <dig> encoding functions of a retrotransposon . the assembly of the sequences resulting from the shotgun library did not overlap the three contigs shown in figure  <dig> and their order could not be determine. with the recent release of the 7× draft sequence assembly   from the soybean genome of cultivar williams  <dig>  a blastn search was run with the sequences of the three contigs from 71b <dig> bac clone. it was determined that contigs- <dig> and - <dig> are adjacent in scaffold_ <dig> and contig- <dig> sequence is an insertion in the middle of contig- <dig>  for that reason contig- <dig> was drawn above contig- <dig> in figure  <dig>  because the sequences with high similarity to the three contigs mapped closely together in scaffold_ <dig>  we can presume conservation of this region in the two cultivars, williams  <dig> and pi <dig> ).

we reported earlier that the f3'h gene appeared to be single copy in soybean  <cit> . the results of a blast search of the 7× draft sequence assembly  from the soybean genome of cultivar williams with the williams f3'h gene sequence  and the sequence of bac clone 71b <dig>  all pointing to a single scaffold_ <dig> with only one full f3'h gene copy, are further evidence that f3'h is a single copy gene in soybean. these results also explain the gray trichome phenotype of the soybean line in which the large tgmt* element inserted in intron- <dig> of the single copy of the f3'h gene in soybean.

discussion
although the molecular structures of  <dig> deletion derivative cacta transposable elements  as well as that of a tgm-express <dig> cacta transposon of  <dig>  kb that carries  <dig> gene fragments  <cit>  have been described for the soybean, the existence of an autonomous element has remained elusive. a recent study that helped identify the t locus as a flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase  gene was based on the sequence and expression of two different recessive alleles  <cit>  that specify gray instead of tawny color trichomes. the t allele of richland was characterized molecularly and was found to have a base deletion that creates a frame shift and terminates the f3'h open reading frame prematurely. the second gray trichome allele studied  was derived from a different genetic stock, line  <dig>  that had undetectable f3'h mrna levels but no significant differences in the genomic sequence of the two f3'h fragments we had isolated and analyzed. the  <dig> stable, gray-trichome, line, was originally derived from a single rogue plant having chimeric sectors of both tawny and gray trichomes on the same plant that appeared spontaneously in the field of a breading program. a stable tawny line, xb22a  and the gray/tawny mutable  <dig>  line were also derived from that initial rogue plant. the continued mutability of this isoline and the spontaneous appearance of the rogue progenitor plant suggested the existence of an autonomous transposable element in this soybean genetic stock that manifested in the mixed trichome phenotype.

as we had predicted in the above mentioned study, the portion of f3'h genomic sequence that eluded us at that time was a  <dig>  kb intron- <dig> in which a cacta tranposon,  <dig>  kb in size, had inserted in the gray trichome allele  . this large insertion could have prevented proper splicing of intron- <dig> and assembly of a functional f3'h mrna. the mutable line  <dig> has the gray  and tawny  alleles in its genetic make-up . the  <dig>  kb element was named tgmt* and its isolation through long-distance pcr amplification permitted its sequencing, molecular characterization and the study of its expression in the mutable and the stable gray or tawny trichome isolines.

tgmt* has imperfect  <dig> base cacta inverted repeats, a target site duplication  and the asymmetric highly structured subterminal regions characteristic of the cacta transposon family. the  <dig> bp cacta inverted repeats and the reiterated subterminal sequence motif, are cis-determinants for transposition. unlike the  <dig> bp cacta inverted repeats that are conserved, the subterminal repeats vary in size and sequence among the different cacta transposons. the subterminal repeated motifs of the soybean cacta elements analyzed  were more complex than the en- <dig> motif. it has been proposed that a dna-binding protein encoded by the transposon attaches to these subterminal motifs to help or suppress the element's excision  <cit> . two of the well characterized dna binding proteins tnpa of en- <dig> and tnp <dig> of tam <dig> shared little similarity and it was suggested that non-homologous dna binding proteins may recognize diverse subterminal dna-binding motifs  <cit> . the tgmt* subterminal repeated sequence motif is not only different from that of en- <dig> transposon but it diverged from the repeated motif in another soybean cacta element, tgm <dig>  <cit>  . our results, thus, reinforce the notion of variability in subterminal regions of a cacta element that is likely paralleled by dna-binding protein diversity. in addition, the difference observed between the tgm <dig> subterminal repeat motif and that of the tgmt* family , suggests that tgm <dig> is a deletion derivative from another cacta element distancing from tgmt*. could the tnpa-like dna binding protein encoded in tgmt* help in the excision/suppression of tgm1? although the repeated sequence motifs are different among all cacta transposons characterized, it is possible that there is some communality among them that is recognized by the dissimilar tnpa-like proteins. the alignment of all subterminal repeated motifs shown in figure  <dig> showed some broad similarities with a gc rich and at rich domains. the gc rich domain may also be a site susceptible to methylation which could hinder tnpa-like binding and consequent inhibition of transposon excision  <cit> .

the large and complex gene- <dig> found in the negative strand through gene prediction web-based algorithms was confirmed by rt-pcr amplified cdnas. it is a dual function gene with  <dig> exons stretching a length of  <dig>  bp from the start site  to the polya  out of the  <dig>  bp tgmt* element. a precursor transcript of ~ <dig>  kb codes for a putative transposase with a tnp <dig> and a tnp1domains. a smaller mrna of ~ <dig>  kb resulted from alternatively splicing the 5'end  of exon- <dig> to the 3'end of intron- <dig>   <dig> bp upstream of exon- <dig> ). the product of this mosaic transcript had no conserved domains and in a ncbi basic blastx the highest similarity was to a hypothetical v.vinifera protein  with 79% similarities over a stretch of  <dig> aa. likewise, the transposase mrna in a similar blastx had 64% similarity to a v. vinifera hypothetical protein . in addition, the domain architecture of the transposase is most similar to that of an o. sativa protein  with a  tnp <dig> motif and a  tnp1/en/spm motif. these results suggest that the soybean tgmt* gene- <dig> is more closely related to genes in v. vinifera, o.sativa and arabidopsis than to those of z. mays, en- <dig> and a. majus, tam <dig>  en- <dig> transposase has also two domains, the  tnp <dig> that seems to be conserved in all cacta element transposases, but the second domain is of the  ptta/en/spm family.

another distinction of tgmt* is that the 82% high gc content of exon- <dig>  in en- <dig> element does not occur. because cpg residues are sensitive to methylation, that region of en- <dig> with high gc content was proposed as potential site for gene regulation. the gc content of tgmt* gene- <dig> is uniformly lower with a 40% average throughout. thus, transposon inactivation by methylation may not require such large concentration of cpg residues.

although the majority of intron-exon splicing occurs at the canonical gt-ag boundaries, it is of interest to point out that the splice signals used to create the ~ <dig>  kb mosaic transcripts do not appear to be either the gt-ag for intron splicing or the ctpuapy branch site signal typically located 20– <dig> bp upstream of the acceptor site where pu = a or g and py = c or t  <cit> . we do not know if the ataat motifs adjacent to both the donor and acceptor splice sites are used as recognition signals in tgmt*. alternatively, the splicing mechanism in this transposon may resemble the sex lethal gene model of the fruit fly where splicing signals may be masked by a regulatory protein  <cit> . this type of mechanism could have evolved to help reduce the number of transposition events. a regulatory protein that binds to exon- <dig> blocking transcription of the transposase gene orf <dig> and orf <dig> would nonetheless allow splicing of the mosaic transcript. this blockage could result in reduction of transposon excision while allowing the suppressor function of the mosaic protein that will bind to the subterminal repeats of the element when possible.

the copy number of cacta elements in z. mays has been estimated to 50– <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> a. thaliana  <cit> . the soybean tgm family is also repetitive with earlier estimates from dna blots using the element ends as probes, determining that the family of deletion derivatives numbered less than  <dig> copies per genome  <cit> . that figure may have been an underestimate as it likely included only the tgm <dig> family of elements, excluding all those elements of the tgmt* family. our blast search also showed that the transposase first orf is very repetitive throughout the soybean genome. however, based on rna blot results probed with exon- <dig> sequence as well as the under-representation in the soybean expressed sequence tag  collections, the number of active elements seems to be very low. it is possible that there are multiple autonomous tgm elements in soybean but that they are inactivated by methylation under optimal growth conditions and re-activated in stressful environments. precedent for this has been shown with rice retrotransposons where the copy number increased from  <dig> to  <dig> in some strains as measured by dna blots  <cit> .

on support of the possible existence of multiple autonomous elements in the soybean genome is the result obtained from a blast search of the 7× draft sequence assembly glyma <dig>  that produced  <dig> regions  with significant similarities to the tgmt* gene- <dig> sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the molecular bases for the soybean gray trichome phenotype of the mutant t* allele to be a  <dig>  kb putative cacta transposon  inserted in intron- <dig> of the single copy f3'h gene. tgmt* has conserved  <dig> bp tirs, the  <dig> bp target site duplication and asymmetric subterminal repeated motif. the latter distinguished two cacta-transposon families in soybean and defined regions of some similarity among other cacta transposons subterminal motifs. tgmt* expressed a  <dig>  kb gene- <dig> that encodes the two functions required of an active, autonomous element: a transposase with a conserved tnp <dig> domain and a mosaic transcript bearing little homology to other transposon mosaic gene products. thus, tgmt* has the potential to be an active and autonomous transposon expressed in two isolines of the genetic stock studied. tgmt* transposase is more closely related to o. sativa and a. thaliana transposases with a tnp <dig>  domain than to en- <dig> transposase with a ptta  domain.

in addition, our results support previous assertions that cacta transposases are conserved, most likely because they associate with the conserved cacta tirs during scission and insertion, while the dna-binding proteins, products of mosaic transcripts that bind to subterminal less-conserved repeated motifs, share little similarity. the divergence of the subterminal repeats within soybean as exemplified by the two subtypes of tgm <dig> versus tgmt* indicate that within-species diversification into subtypes of subterminal repeats and the mosaic transcript products that bind them, will be more extensively found as more genomes are sequenced and analyzed.
