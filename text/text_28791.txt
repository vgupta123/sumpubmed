BACKGROUND
in vitro platelet aggregation in feline blood samples is a well-known phenomenon resulting in pseudothrombocytopenia, with reported prevalences of 52 %  <cit> , 62 %  <cit> , and 71 %  <cit> . several attempts have been made to prevent or dissolve platelet aggregates and decrease pseudothrombocytopenia in feline blood samples to increase the reliability of feline platelet counts. it has been shown that a citrate-based anticoagulant containing the platelet inhibitors theophylline, adenosine, and dipyridamole reduces feline platelet aggregation in blood samples more effectively than citrate or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid   <cit> . tvedten and korcal investigated whether mixing blood with a vortex mixer could disaggregate platelet aggregates mechanically, but few of the investigated samples appeared to have all platelet aggregates dispersed  <cit> . consequently vortex mixing does not seem to be a consistent means of correcting the problem of feline platelet aggregation. prostaglandins are synthesized from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase in the cell membranes of nearly all tissues. both prostaglandin e <dig>  and prostaglandin i <dig>  have platelet aggregation inhibitory activities, and pge <dig> has been successfully used to inhibit platelet aggregates in platelet-rich feline plasma  <cit> . a combination of an optical platelet count together with adding pge <dig> to edta blood collection tubes is recommended for platelet counting in feline patients with potential thrombocytopenia  <cit> . pgi <dig> is the most potent platelet aggregation inhibitor, but it is very unstable at physiological ph values and requires strict handling procedures  <cit> . three decades ago, the stable pgi <dig> analogue iloprost was synthesized. iloprost is used as a therapeutic agent in human medicine to treat peripheral vascular diseases, severe pulmonary hypertension, and thrombangiitis obliterans  <cit> . platelet aggregation and release reactions stimulated by aggregating agents such as arachidonic acid, collagen, or epinephrine are essentially abolished by nanomolar concentrations of iloprost. the anti-aggregatory effect of iloprost is based on an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate  within the platelet. platelets have high-affinity binding sites for pgi <dig> that can also bind iloprost in a reversible, saturable manner. the formation of camp by the enzyme adenylate cyclase is mediated via these receptors. increasing levels of camp within the platelet influence several processes involved in platelet activation, including the regulation of phospholipases and free cytosolic calcium levels  <cit> . because of its chemical and biological stability, universal potent anti-aggregatory effect, and availability, iloprost is more likely than pgi <dig> and pge <dig> to be useful in preventing platelet aggregation in feline blood samples. the aims of the present study were  to evaluate the anti-aggregatory effect of iloprost on feline platelet counts and to determine a useful concentration to inhibit platelet aggregation in edta samples from clinically healthy cats,  to investigate the effect of iloprost on hematological blood parameters, and  to determine stability of iloprost in k3-edta tubes.

methods
pilot study with different iloprost concentrations
to test the overall effectiveness of iloprost to prevent feline platelet aggregation, six different iloprost amounts between 1 μg  and 20 ng  were tested in blood samples from five clinically healthy cats well known to build platelet aggregates in edta blood tubes . just before blood collection, a 1 ml ampulla containing 20 μg of iloprost  was opened and a predetermined volume was pipetted into  <dig>  ml k3-edta tubes  with a micropipette . blood was collected with a needle  and a 5 ml syringe  from the jugular vein. the needle was immediately removed after collection, and equal amounts of blood were placed in a k3-edta tube and three k3-edta tubes containing different iloprost concentrations. the two persons involved in the blood collection process ensured that filling, closing, and mixing of all blood tubes occurred nearly simultaneously. all tubes were gently mixed for 2 min. a second blood collection was performed to test the remaining three iloprost concentrations. for three of the five cats, blood collection was performed under deep sedation .

the blood samples were analyzed at 15 min , 30 min, and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 4 h  after blood collection. between time points, the blood was mixed at room temperature on an automated mixer . at each time point, blood samples were analyzed on the sysmex xt-2000iv  for impedance and optical platelet counts and for total white blood cell  counts  <cit> , and a blood smear was prepared and stained .

approval for collecting blood samples was given by the veterinary office of the canton zurich, switzerland .

evaluation of the effect of 20 ng  and 200 ng  of iloprost on  <dig> feline edta samples
blood samples were next obtained from the jugular vein of  <dig> clinically healthy cats . blood collection was performed as described for the pilot study. immediately after collection, the needle was removed and equal amounts of blood were placed in  <dig>  ml k3-edta tubes without iloprost, with 1 μl  iloprost, and with 10 μl  iloprost, respectively. blood collection was performed under deep sedation in  <dig> of the  <dig> cats. the blood samples were analyzed at 15 min and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h after blood collection. between time points, the blood was mixed on an automated mixer at room temperature . at each time point, the blood samples were analyzed on the sysmex xt-2000iv  for a complete blood cell count including impedance and optical platelet counts, and a blood smear was prepared. seven cats with platelet aggregates were additionally analyzed on the mythic  <dig> instrument  for total wbc counts at two time points  <cit> . the first measurement was immediately after blood collection, and the second was performed when platelet counts on the sysmex xt-2000iv dropped under the lower reference limit  for the first time. all blood smears were assessed by one of the authors for the presence of platelet aggregates by applying the following scoring system per slide:  <dig>  no aggregates;  <dig>  aggregates of 2– <dig> platelets;  <dig>  aggregates of 6– <dig> platelets;  <dig>  aggregates of 16– <dig> platelets; and  <dig>  aggregates of > <dig> platelets. furthermore, blood smears were evaluated for estimation of wbc counts and to determine whether iloprost has an effect of wbc and rbc morphology.

iloprost stability study
iloprost stability was investigated over 16 weeks using blood samples from two clinically healthy cats known to develop platelet aggregates after each blood collection. both cats had previously been used in the second experiment of the present study. before study onset,  <dig> edta tubes  were prepared with 1 μl  of ilomedin. twenty tubes were stored at room temperature, and another  <dig> tubes were stored at 37 °c in an incubator. blood collection was performed after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 16 weeks of storage. at each time point, 3 ml of blood was collected from the jugular vein as previously described and distributed equally into one k3-edta tube, one k3-edta tube with 1 μl  iloprost stored at room temperature, and one k3-edta tube with 1 μl  iloprost stored at 37 °c. the blood samples were analyzed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 4 h after collection in the sysmex xt-2000iv for optical platelet counts.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed with the software packages r and nlme  <cit> . linear mixed effects models were used to model the outcome variable platelet counts, wbc, red blood cell , hematocrit , hemoglobin concentration , mean corpuscular hemoglobin , mean corpuscular volume , and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration  measured on the sysmex xt-2000iv, with the potential explanatory variables time, iloprost administration , aggregates , an interaction term between iloprost and aggregates as fixed effects, and cats as random effects to account for potential within-animal clustering. model selection and validation were based on akaike’s information criterion and the residuals for normality and homogeneity were checked visually. the results of the linear mixed effects models are given as effect sizes and their corresponding standard errors and p-values. to evaluate the changes in wbc counts analyzed with the mythic  <dig> instrument  at two time points, paired t-tests with and without iloprost administration were performed.

bar charts were made using graphpad prism .

RESULTS
pilot study with different iloprost concentrations
within 4 h, mean platelet counts decreased in all edta tubes without iloprost at timepoints 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 4 h under the lower reference limit . in the edta tubes with iloprost, mean platelet counts remained within the reference limits at each of the six tested iloprost concentrations . all tested iloprost concentrations were effective to prevent pseudothrombocytopenia.fig.  <dig> bar chart showing results from the pilot study with different iloprost concentrations. mean optical platelet counts  from  <dig> cats with platelet aggregation without iloprost and with 25 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, 200 ng, 400 ng and 1 μg iloprost at  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 4 h after blood collection. the black line indicates the upper reference interval for feline platelets 



evaluation of the effect of 1 μl  and 10 μl  iloprost on  <dig> feline edta samples
fifty percent of the investigated feline edta samples without iloprost showed pseudothrombocytopenia, with platelet counts under the lower reference limit at different time points. in edta tubes with iloprost, pseudothrombocytopenia was prevented in all cases; however platelet aggregates were not completely dissolved. blood smear evaluation of edta samples with iloprost yielded platelet aggregation scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas blood smears from edta samples without iloprost had platelet aggregations scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  iloprost had no effect on wbc and rbc morphology.

no significant effect of iloprost administration on wbc, rbc, hgb, hct or mcv was found. although significant , the effect of iloprost administration on mch and mchc was considered to be clinically irrelevant with a decrease of -  <dig>  pg  and -  <dig>  g/dl . a significant increase over time for mcv, rbc, hct, hgb and mchc, albeit clinically not relevant, was observed.

in edta samples without iloprost, mean wbc counts measured with the mythic  <dig> increased strongly at the second measurement time point compared with the first. at the first time point mean wbc count was  <dig>  × 103/μl , and at the second time point it was  <dig>  × 103/μl . in contrast mean wbc counts in edta tubes with iloprost remained completely stable at  <dig>  × 103/μl  at both time points. based on paired t-tests, the difference between the two time points differed significantly in the samples without iloprost  but not in the group with iloprost administration. blood smear evaluation from edta samples without iloprost showed platelet aggregates in all cats at the second measurement time point; however no change in wbc count and distribution was observed compared to the blood smears from edta samples with iloprost.

discussion
this is the first study showing a strong anti-aggregatory effect for the synthetic pgi <dig> analogue iloprost on feline platelet counts. in clinically healthy cats, pseudothrombocytopenia was completely prevented in all blood samples in edta tubes containing iloprost. without iloprost, if significant numbers of platelet aggregates were present  in an edta blood sample, the mean optical platelet count decreased by 105 × 103/μl. this decrease was completely counterbalanced by the presence of iloprost in the edta tube. iloprost did not affect optical platelet counts in samples without aggregates or with score  <dig> aggregates. for impedance platelet counts, the effect of iloprost on aggregates was similar.

iloprost effectively prevented pseudothrombocytopenia in the present study, but it did not dissolve platelet aggregates completely. cats with optical platelet counts that remained within the reference intervals during the evaluation period nevertheless showed occasionally small platelet aggregates in blood smears, which were classified according to the scoring index as  <dig> or  <dig>  in blood smears from edta samples with iloprost, these platelets were observed to retain their granules over the evaluation period, and appeared morphologically round. in contrast, platelets that formed aggregates in samples without iloprost lost their shape, formed pseudopods, and lost their granules. the scoring index used in this study to judge the presence of platelet aggregates in the blood smear was limited in that only the size, but not the frequency of aggregates, was investigated. if a single platelet aggregate with a score of  <dig>  was identified, the sample was categorized as having a platelet aggregate score of  <dig>  in feline samples with unaffected optical platelet counts, platelet aggregates consisted mainly of only six to seven platelets. the blood smear evaluation technique used in this study seemed to be a very sensitive method for detecting platelet aggregates, particularly if the feathered edges of the smear were examined. from this observation it can be speculated that a few platelet aggregates consisting only of a small number of platelets do not influence the optical platelet count of the sysmex xt-2000iv.

similar to pgi <dig>  pge <dig> has platelet anti-aggregatory properties  <cit>  previously showed that feline platelets exposed to pge <dig> become immediately and persistently nonreactive to agonists, which prevents platelet aggregation and consequently improves platelet count accuracy. tvedten and johansson  <cit>  demonstrated higher feline platelet counts in feline samples containing pge <dig>  although a complete inhibition of aggregation could not be achieved. on blood smear evaluation, pge1-treated samples had occasional platelet aggregates, but many more and larger aggregates were seen in edta samples. although pge <dig> has been shown to successfully prevent in vitro platelet aggregation in blood samples from cats, it is not used in daily laboratory hematology testing because of its poor stability.

in vivo, pgi <dig> is one of the main platelet anti-aggregatory agents. similar to pge <dig>  pgi <dig> is characterized by poor stability; it has a half-life of approximately 2 min at 37 °c and ph of  <dig> , and its activity is gone in 20 min at 22 °c  <cit> . use of pgi <dig> in laboratory hematology testing is not practical. the synthetic pgi <dig> analogue iloprost is both qualitatively and quantitatively more effective as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation than either pgi <dig> or pge <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, iloprost is available as ilomedin, an intravenous drug in human medicine. ilomedin is readily usable due to its pharmacological formulation. in the present study, all iloprost concentrations tested showed the same strong anti-aggregatory effect on feline platelets. concentrations for pgi <dig> causing 50 % inhibition of adp-induced platelet aggregation have been reported for different species other than the cat, and range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ng/ml  <cit> . due to the specific peculiarities of the feline platelet, which appears to be more readily activated and aggregated compared to other species  <cit> , the authors assumed that higher amounts of iloprost would be needed to inhibit aggregation of feline platelets. to investigate the effect of iloprost in a reasonable number of cat blood samples, 1 μl  and 10 μl  of iloprost were chosen. both amounts achieved the same effect, and no significant difference between edta tubes with 1 μl vs. 10 μl was observed. for this reason, the iloprost stability study and iloprost testing in clinical cases were performed with 1 μl  iloprost. the smaller amounts are likely sufficient to prevent pseudothrombocytopenia, but amounts greater than 1 μl  and 10 μl  would be needed to completely prevent platelet aggregation.

the use of iloprost in veterinary hematology would be beneficial for preventing pseudothrombocytopenia in feline edta samples. adding iloprost to edta tubes used for hematological analysis of feline blood samples should improve the reliability of platelet counts. the main weaknesses of pgi <dig> and pge <dig> for routine application are their poor stability and complex handling procedures. in contrast, iloprost can be stored at room temperature, and is easy to handle and immediately useable. in the present study iloprost was stored for up to 16 weeks in edta tubes at room temperature and at 37 °c. the effectiveness of iloprost on platelet aggregates persisted over the entire storage time. iloprost did not significantly affect hematological parameters, cytological evaluation of the blood smears and the observed decreases in mch and mchc were negligible.

it is a well-known phenomenon in feline blood samples that platelet aggregates can falsely increase wbc counts and decrease platelet counts in impedance-based hematological instruments  <cit> . in the present study, false-positive leucocytosis was observed in six out of seven edta samples, whereas false leucocytosis did not occur in the edta samples with iloprost. this observation is important because impedance-based instruments are widely used in veterinary practices, and false wbc counts due to platelet aggregation are a common finding. using edta tubes with iloprost for hematological analysis on impedance instruments would improve the reliability of both wbc counts and platelet counts in cats.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this is the first study showing an anti-aggregatory effect of the pgi2-analogue iloprost in feline edta blood. in all clinically healthy cats investigated, pseudothrombocytopenia was prevented by adding iloprost to edta tubes prior to blood collection. furthermore, iloprost was very useful in preventing falsely increased wbc counts in samples with platelet aggregates analyzed on impedance-based hematological instruments. iloprost is preferable to pgi <dig> or pge <dig> due to its stability and easy and safe handling properties. cytological evaluations of blood smears as well as other hematological parameters were not influenced to a clinically significant degree by the presence of iloprost.
