BACKGROUND
bacterial type ii restriction-modification  systems are abundant in both the bacterial and the archaeal worlds  <cit> . many play important roles in defense against phage  <cit> , but they also appear to modulate horizontal gene transfer  <cit> , and to act as "selfish" toxin-antitoxin addiction modules  <cit> . type ii rm systems generally specify separate dna methyltransferase  and restriction endonuclease  proteins  <cit> . many type ii rm systems are on mobile genetic elements, but even chromosomal rm systems can move into new host cells via transduction, transformation or conjugation  <cit> .

pvuii is a plasmid-borne type ii rm system from the gram-negative bacterium proteus vulgaris  <cit> . the mtase  modifies the cognate dna sequence cagctg by methylating the internal cytosine  <cit> , generating n4-methylcytosine  <cit> ; while the rease  cleaves the central gpc if this sequence is unmethylated  <cit> . the rease and mtase act independently of each other in type ii rm systems. as a result, strict regulation is needed after the genes enter a new cell in order to delay rease accumulation until the mtase has had time to protect the new host's dna. the basis for this regulation is unknown for most rm systems.

a subset of type ii rm systems are controlled by a third gene, that was designated as "c"  protein when first discovered in the bamhi and pvuii systems  <cit> . sequence comparisons quickly identified orthologs in the smai and ecorv systems  <cit> , and since then c proteins have been identified  in a wide variety of other rm systems  <cit> .

the transcriptional regulation of c-controlled rm systems is understood in outline, from the structure of the c proteins  <cit> , through their action at conserved "c boxes" upstream of the c genes  <cit> , to their dual function as activators and repressors  <cit>  and possible interaction with rpod   <cit> . the temporal behavior of one of these systems has also been studied, following its introduction into new host cells  <cit> .

the pvuii genes naturally reside on a mobilizable plasmid  <cit> . when these genes enter a new host cell with no pre-existing c.pvuii protein, the mtase gene  is rapidly transcribed from a pair of c-independent promoters  <cit>  . the rease gene  has no separate promoter, and depends on two promoters upstream of the c gene pvuiic  <cit> . one of these two promoters is weak but independent of c.pvuii. the resulting transcript begins  <dig> nt upstream of the pvuiic initiation codon  <cit>  , so translation relies on a ribosome binding site   <cit> . because most of our experiments are carried out in e. coli, it is important that the 3'  <dig> nt of  <dig> s rrna, which includes the "anti-shine-dalgarno" sequence complementary to the rbs, is identical in e. coli and p. vulgaris .

the rbs for pvuiic is very poor , based on the very limited similarity to an aggagg motif  <cit> . the expected poor translation initiation would synergize with the lack of transcriptional autogenous activation by c.pvuii  <cit> , by slowing the elongation of any transcripts that did get produced  <cit> . in contrast, when c.pvuii eventually begins to accumulate, it activates transcription from the second promoter, rapidly boosting transcription of pvuiic and pvuiir via a positive feedback loop  <cit> . furthermore, the resulting c.pvuii-dependent transcript is leaderless  <cit> , beginning at the pvuiic initiator codon, and is thus independent of the rbs  <cit> .

a key area of uncertainty in this model is whether transcription-level regulation is sufficient to protect the cell. early transcription from the weak c-independent promoter appears to proceed into pvuiir  <cit> . if pvuiir mrna can be translated well, independent of the rate at which the upstream pvuiic gene is translated, this might lead to unacceptably rapid early accumulation of restriction activity. unlike pvuiic, pvuiir has an obvious rbs motif . we accordingly investigated whether there is some form of translational control of pvuiir.

we were particularly intrigued by two features of the pvuii genes: first, the pvuiic and pvuiir genes overlap, and second, pvuiir is preceded by potential hairpins, one of which would occlude the pvuiir rbs. the pvuiic and pvuiir genes are cotranscribed  <cit> , and many polycistronic transcripts require translation of an upstream gene for efficient translation of a subsequent gene. this phenomenon, resulting from poor loading of free ribosomes onto the internal translation initiator, is called translational coupling, and was first observed in the tryptophan operon of e. coli  <cit> . coupling might play an important role in delaying rease accumulation in c-controlled rm systems, relative to that of mtase, after the genes for the system enter a new host cell. the frequent proximity between the c-gene terminators and r-gene initiators in c-protein-controlled rm systems  is suggestive of translational coupling  <cit> . regarding the hairpins, they were noted in earlier studies, and at least one of them could explain termination products seen in some primer extension experiments  <cit> . in addition to the overlap and hairpins, in another c-controlled rm system , the c protein itself has an apparent translational regulatory role  <cit> . accordingly, we also tested the ability of c.pvuii to affect translation of pvuiicr mrna in trans.

RESULTS
translational lacz fusions to pvuiic and pvuiir
to explore possible translational coupling, we made lacz translational fusions to the pvuiic and pvuiir genes . importantly, in these fusions, transcription is from placuv <dig> and is independent of c.pvuii. furthermore, the vector's rbs is used, ensuring consistent and efficient translation initiation of pvuiic.

we first measured β-galactosidase activity from wt fusions . over the course of exponential-phase growth, the plot of activity vs. culture density should be linear if the culture is in balanced growth and the assay is in the linear range. the resulting slopes give a precise measure of relative activity. using this approach, the level of expression of the wt pvuiir-lacz translational fusion was not significantly different from that of the wt pvuiic-lacz fusion . providing wt c.pvuii  in trans from a second, compatible plasmid had little if any effect on the fusions . the four slopes are very similar, giving a combined average ± se of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . this is inconsistent with trans-acting translational effects of c.pvuii protein, unlike the case of c.eco72i  <cit> .

assessing translational coupling of pvuiic and pvuiir
because coupling is sensitive to the proximity of the termination and start codons of the coupled genes  <cit> , lacz specific activity was measured in pvuiir-lacz fusions with the pvuiic stop codon at its native site  or moved ~ <dig> nt downstream; no effect of this move was seen on translation of pvuiir-lacz fusions . we also generated stop codons  <dig> or  <dig> bp upstream of the pvuiir initiation codon , in an otherwise-wt pvuiir-lacz translational fusion, and measured the lacz activity . these stop codons did not detectably affect translation in the pvuiir reading frame.

nevertheless, previous findings  <cit>  and the results from the wt translational fusions indicate that the translation of pvuiir is very similar to that of pvuiic under several conditions, consistent with their translation being coupled. accordingly we further tested this possibility.

frameshift mutation in pvuiic reduces translation of pvuiir
we next determined the effects of mutations within pvuiic, using our system in which transcription is driven from a promoter unaffected by c.pvuii. wt c.pvuii was supplied from a compatible plasmid in trans. figure 6a is a correlogram, showing β-galactosidase expression, with the upstream orf being wt or mutant pvuiic, and lacz is fused in the pvuiic reading frame  or in the pvuiir reading frame . the pvuiic termination codon was, in all cases, in the native location. when pvuiic was wt , translation was roughly equivalent in both reading frames.

esp <dig> is an in-frame insertion of one leucine codon into pvuiic, within the first helix of the dna-binding helix-turn-helix motif  <cit>  . like the "wt" fusions, the pvuiic-esp <dig> fusions gave similar translational activity in both reading frames. furthermore, the levels of translation were fairly similar to those when pvuiic was wt.

cla <dig> is a frameshift mutation in pvuiic that results in a termination codon ~ <dig> nt upstream of the normal stop codon  <cit>  . the new stop codon is uag followed by a, which in one in vivo assay system gives a termination rate of about 50%  <cit> . this mutation led to a roughly fivefold decrease in β-galactosidase expression, relative to the wt fusions, when lacz was fused in either reading frame. this effect appears to be due to transcriptional polarity , but the important point here is that pvuiir- and pvuiic-frame translation changed in parallel.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr  reveals transcriptional polarity
the parallel fivefold drop in pvuiic and pvuiir translation in the pvuiic-cla <dig> frameshift mutant  could reflect premature translation termination leading to premature transcript termination  <cit> . to test this, relative lacz mrna levels were determined by qrt-pcr for the wt and both mutant pvuiir-lacz fusion strains . in the case of cla <dig>  the amount of lacz mrna dropped by the same fivefold amount as did translation , consistent with transcriptional polarity .

however, surprisingly, the levels of lacz mrna dropped by about the same extent in the strains bearing an in-frame single-codon insertion . the junction sequences of the cla <dig> and esp <dig> fusions are identical . esp <dig> only minimally changed the level of pvuiir-lacz translation , but this implies that it substantially increased the apparent translational initiation at the downstream pvuiir initiator, relative to wt, as there is only about an eighth as much mrna .

putative hairpins upstream of pvuiir have no obvious effect on its translation
the pvuiir gene is preceded by two predicted, alternative hairpins . previous primer extension studies  <cit>  were consistent with the presence of the upstream hairpin , as a termination product was seen immediately adjacent to the predicted stem . these hairpins might regulate translation of pvuiir, because the downstream hairpin  would occlude the rbs. occlusion of an rbs by mrna secondary structure is a major determinant of translational initiation rates  <cit> .

if this model is correct, altering arm  <dig>  should disrupt both hairpins and thus increase pvuiir translation, while altering arm  <dig> should disrupt the 5' hairpin, promote formation of the 3' hairpin, and thus decrease translation of pvuiir. we made an in-frame deletion of arm  <dig> from the wt construct  and tested the effects on a pvuiir-lacz translational fusion . rather than the predicted increase in translation, this deletion reduced expression somewhat.  in contrast, the Δarm <dig> deletion  was predicted to reduce pvuiir-lacz translation, but did so only mildly, and even then only in the presence of wt c.pvuii supplied in trans .

discussion
in bacteria such as e coli, genes are often transcribed into polycistronic mrnas  <cit> . ribosomes from an upstream gene can reinitiate translation at the next initiator in a process called translational coupling. the extent of dependence on reinitiation  varies, but tends to vary inversely with the distance between the termination and reinitiation codon  <cit> . in most polycistronic operons, termination codons are close to the initiation codon of the downstream gene; in many cases they even overlap  <cit> , as in the bcni and ahdi r-m systems . a high degree of coupling results in coordinated expression of the genes, as illustrated by the gal operon  <cit> .

in rm systems that rely on upstream c genes to mediate the delay in rease expression, allowing the mtase time to protect a new host's chromosome  <cit> ; translational coupling could play an important role in the regulatory design. the c and r genes of another c-activated rm system, esp1396i, are in fact translationally coupled  <cit> . furthermore, as shown in figure  <dig>  translation of pvuiic from the early pvuiicr transcripts relies on a poor rbs . translational coupling of pvuiir to pvuiic would ensure that very little r.pvuii is made from the early transcripts . once c.pvuii begins to accumulate, it not only generates a positive feedback loop by activating a second promoter upstream of pvuiic, but translation of these later transcripts should be much more efficient as they are leaderless  <cit>  and do not rely on the weak rbs.

however our evidence provides no consistent evidence that the translation of pvuiir is coupled to that of pvuiic. most significantly, moving the pvuiic termination codon in either direction relative to the pvuiir initiator  had no apparent effect. in contrast, coupled genes are quite sensitive to the stop-start codon spacing .

this lack of coupling is consistent with previous work from our laboratory. we had demonstrated a sharp decrease in the expression of pvuiir in each of four pvuiic null mutants  <cit> , including two in-frame  and two frameshift  mutants . these mutants showed greatly-impaired restriction of infection by unmethylated bacteriophage λ, or of transformation by plasmid dna, and the in vitro r.pvuii activity was ~104-fold less than in strains that carried the intact parental plasmid. providing pvuiic in trans had no effect on the wt strain, but providing it to any of the pvuiic mutants resulted in full restoration of in vivo or in vitro r.pvuii activity. however boosting transcription of frameshift mutants, that terminate translation ~ <dig> nt upstream of the pvuiir initiation codon , would not have restored a flow of translating ribosomes to the pvuiir initiator, so these results conflict with coupling.

c proteins themselves can have regulatory effects at the translational level. in the eco72i rm system  <cit> , providing c.eco72i in trans to eco72ir-lacz translational fusions restored rease gene expression even when the upstream eco72ic gene included a frameshift mutation. however, in the case of pvuii, neither pvuiic-lacz nor pvuiir-lacz translational fusions showed substantial effects of supplying c.pvuii in trans.

hairpins in the rna that occlude rbss can reduce translation initiation  <cit> , though initiating ribosomes have the capacity to unfold mrna  <cit>  and may also be prepositioned to slide into place when an rna hairpin spontaneously unfolds  <cit> . in-frame deletions in pvuiic, that would affect predicted alternative hairpins upstream of pvuiir and thus alter the availability of the pvuiir rbs , had no major effect . however, the hairpins might nonetheless reduce the entry of new ribosomes at the pvuiir rbs, while not affecting progress of translating ribosomes. searching for potential rbs-occluding hairpins in other c-dependent r-m systems showed that 9/ <dig> had such hairpins with Δg values ≤ - <dig>  kcal/mol . for comparison, the equivalent pvuii hairpin has a predicted Δg of - <dig>  kcal/mol.

CONCLUSIONS
the genes for rm systems are often associated with mobile genetic elements, and temporal control is critical following the entry of these genes into a new cell, to avoid restriction of the host's chromosome. the role of translation-level regulation in this process has not been well studied. in examining the pvuii rm system, we found that translation of the downstream rease gene  is independent of that of the upstream gene for the autogenous activator/repressor , at least under the conditions used. this independence was despite the overlapping genes and the presence of putative rna hairpins involving the pvuiir rbs. this suggests that the temporal control of pvuii transcription  <cit> , together with the repair capabilities of the bacteria  <cit> , is sufficiently robust to protect the new host cell following pvuii gene transfer.
