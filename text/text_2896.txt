BACKGROUND
the global production of eggplants has considerably increased, especially in asia and africa, rising from  <dig> to  <dig> millions of tons in the last decade  <cit> . despite its economic importance, compared to other major vegetable crops, few efforts have been made to use related species for the genetic enhancement of common eggplant . in this respect, resistance and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as high levels of bioactive compounds have been found in s. melongena relatives , but they have not been widely used in breeding programs.

although s. melongena, which was domesticated in southeast asia  <cit> , is by far the economically most important cultivated eggplant, there are two other cultivated eggplant species of african origin, s. aethiopicum l. and s. macrocarpon l., which are major vegetable crops  <cit> . the three species, together with a large number of wild species from the eggplant clade and the anguivi clade of solanum subgenus leptostemonum  <cit> , form part of the same genepool. most of these species can be successfully hybridized with s. melongena  <cit> . among them the wild s. incanum l. and the cultivated s. aethiopicum have been regarded as valuable sources of variation for s. melongena breeding .

solanum incanum, which has been regarded for a time as the wild ancestor of s. melongena  <cit> , is naturally distributed in desert and dryland areas in a broad area between northern africa and the middle east of pakistan  <cit> . s. incanum is considered a powerful source of bioactive phenolics, mainly chlorogenic acid  and to lesser extent n--caffeoylputrescine, 3-o-malonyl-5-o--caffeoylquinic acid and 5-o-malonyl-4-o--caffeoylquinic acid  <cit> , showing a content several times higher than that of cultivated eggplants  <cit> . moreover, s. incanum presents resistance at some fungal diseases, like fusarium oxysporum and phomopsis vexans and tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought  <cit> . fully fertile interspecific hybrids have been obtained between s. incanum and s. melongena with a regular meiosis  <cit> , as well as a backcross population to s. melongena that has allowed the development of an interspecific genetic linkage map  <cit> . s. aethiopicum is the second most important cultivated eggplant, and its cultivation is widespread in africa, mainly in the west and central part, as well as in some parts of caribbean, brazil and south italy  <cit> . generally, this species is divided in four cultivar groups, namely aculeatum, gilo, kumba, and shum  <cit> , with the gilo group, used for its edible oval to rounded fruits, the most important group in the s. aethiopicum complex  <cit> . s. aethiopicum is of interest for s. melongena breeding as resistance to fungi , bacteria , insect  as well as root-knot nematodes  has been found in different materials of this species . although different degrees of fertility have been found in interspecific hybrids between s. melongena and s. aethiopicum, backcrosses to s. melongena and introgression materials have been obtained . as s. aethiopicum is a cultivated species, it does not present undesirable traits characteristic of wild species  that have to be removed in breeding programs. also interspecific hybrids between s. melongena and s. aethiopicum are highly vigorous and of interest for being used as rootstocks of s. melongena  <cit> .

despite the importance of eggplants for security food for millions of people, genomics studies in this group have been limited. only s. melongena has received some attention, with several intraspecific and interspecific genetic maps , collections of molecular markers  <cit>  a set of  <dig> unigenes  <cit> , a de novo transcriptome assembly  <cit> , and a draft genome sequence  <cit>  being available. genomic resources in s. melongena relatives are generally scarce. in this respect, while for s. melongena there are  <dig>  dna and rna sequences deposited in ncbi  <cit>  nucleotide database , of which  <dig>  correspond to ests  sequences, only  <dig> sequences are available from s. aethiopicum, none of which is an ests. in s. incanum, a transcriptome assembly was released recently , but it is still unpublished and no analyses have been released up to now.

the only exception concerns s. torvum swartz, with  <dig>  dna and rna sequences, of which  <dig>  are ests. solanum torvum, also known as turkey berry, is used as a vegetable and medicinal plant . also s. torvum shows resistance to many plant and soil-borne disease, such as f. oxysporum, verticillium dahliae, p. parasitica, r. solanacearum, and meloidogyne spp.  <cit> . many efforts have been done to transfer these resistances through different biotechnological approaches, due to the high sterility of hybrids obtained via conventional crosses . however, at present, the main use of s. torvum is as a rootstock for eggplant .

yang et al.  <cit>  sequenced simultaneously the transcriptomes of s. torvum and s. melongena, providing valuable sets of unigenes and detailed information about the two species. however, this study did not include the discovery of molecular markers, which could have been of great assistance in the breeding programs within and between each species.

the aims of the present study are building two transcriptomes from s. incanum and s. aethiopicum through the generation of ests using rna-seq, providing genomic tools in these relatives of s. melongena. this will be the starting point for gene discovery, splicing patterns and other post-transcriptional modifications, as well as expression levels of transcripts during development and under different conditions. furthermore, the trimmed transcripts of s. aethiopicum and s. incanum and the transcripts of s. melongena and s. torvum, downloaded from ncbi database  <cit> , were mapped against the eggplant genome to discover the molecular variations within and between species in order to create large subsets of markers directly applicable in breeding programs along to the eggplant genepool. all this information will contribute to the utilization of these species for s. melongena breeding, as well as to the enhancement of the cultivated, but neglected, s. aethiopicum.

RESULTS
illumina paired-end sequencing and est assembly
the new generation of high-throughput sequencing platforms and the improved algorithms for de novo transcriptome assembly has allowed the availability of transcriptomes even in non-model organisms without a reference genome  <cit> . in our case, in order to build a transcriptome of s. incanum and s. aethiopicum, mixed rna from young leaf, floral bud and young fruit, was used in order to increase the heterogeneity and diversity of the transcripts. two different libraries were constructed, one per species, and subsequently sequenced in a hiseq  <dig> sequencer .

a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from s. incanum and s. aethiopicum respectively , which have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive   <cit> . after the filtering and trimming process, removing adapters and low phred quality sequences,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality sequences were obtained for s. incanum and s. aethiopicum. the trimmed reads were assembled into transcriptomes using trinity software  <cit> , generating  <dig>  transcripts for s. incanum and  <dig>  for s. aethiopicum . subsequently, in order to test the overall assembly quality, the clean reads were mapped against the transcriptomes using bwa  <cit> , which is an ultrafast and memory-efficient mapper particularly good at aligning reads between  <dig> to 100 bp. the large number of reads properly mapped, specifically  <dig>  % for s. incanum and  <dig>  % for s. aethiopicum, confirmed the high quality of trinity assembly. the total length of assembled transcripts for s. incanum and s. aethiopicum was about  <dig> and  <dig> mbp with an average length of  <dig> and 868 bp, respectively. in recent years the assemblies have been improved progressively as a result of the advances in sequencing platforms, especially illumina .table  <dig> statistics of s. incanum and s. aethiopicum assembled transcripts and unigenes, using trinity software

trinity software determines splice variants  and distinguishes transcripts from recently duplicated and identified allelic variants  <cit> . to obtain a set of single-copy gene locus , only the most expressed transcript from the isoforms of each locus was chosen, using the rsem software   <cit> . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were identified in s. incanum and  <dig>  in s. aethiopicum, showing that  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of transcripts were splice variants respectively .

even though the 60 % of unigenes had between  <dig> and 500 bp, more than 20 % of them were longer than  <dig> kbp. the length distribution of unigenes is shown in fig.  <dig>  in order to obtain the physical position of the unigenes, a blastn against the s. melongena genome was performed and the results are illustrated in the circos plot in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  <cit> . the distribution of unigenes was uneven along the eggplant genome. most unigenes clustered in areas which could correspond to the short and long arms of chromosomes, while a lower unigene density was observed in regions which could correspond to the centromere and pericentromeric regions, based on the observation of doganlar et al.  <cit> . this gene distribution is similar to the observed in other species  <cit> . our sets of unigenes are much higher than those obtained for s. melongena and s. torvum. s. melongena unigenes set consisted of  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>  unigenes  <cit> , while in solanum torvum  <dig>  unigenes were obtained  <cit> . a deeper sequencing and better coverage were probably the reasons of the greatest number of our s. incanum and s. aethiopicum datasets unigenes. in fact the number of our total residues was  <dig> , <dig> for s. incanum and  <dig> , <dig> for s. aethiopicum, higher than those obtained by fukuoka et al.  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit>  in s. melongena , and yang et al.  <cit>  in s. torvum . these higher numbers of unigenes has been observed in other plant transcriptomes recently published  in which the number of raw reads obtained was quite large.fig.  <dig> length distribution  of s. incanum and s. aethiopicum unigenes

fig.  <dig> distribution of s. incanum  and s. aethiopicum  assembled unigenes and ssrs on s. melongena genome. in the outer histogram, depicted in green for s. incanum and in red for s. aethiopicum, are represented the assembled unigenes along the eggplant genome . only unigenes which have given an e-value  <dig>  via blastn search were shown. in the inner histograms, in black, the distribution of the ssrs detected in each species is represented



annotation of s. incanum and s. aethiopicum transcriptomes
transcriptome annotation provides insight into the structural, functions and biological processes of assembled unigenes  <cit> . the functional annotation was performed using the assembled unigenes as query in blastx searches against the three major protein databases and tomato protein database in this sequential order: swiss-prot  <cit> , itag <dig>   <cit> , arabidopsis proteins  <cit>  and uniref <dig>  <cit> . moreover a blastx analysis was performed against the non-redundant  protein database of ncbi  <cit>  and the go terms  and ec number  have been assigned through the blast2go software  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>   s. incanum and  <dig>   s. aethiopicum have shown at least one hit in the protein databases. most of the unigenes  were annotated using the manually reviewed swiss-prot database and itag  <dig>   and less using uniref <dig>  and arabidopsis protein database . the unigenes annotated under different protein database are reported in additional file  <dig> 

even though the percentage of unigenes annotated in the protein databases seems to be quite low, the total number,  <dig>  for s. incanum and  <dig>  for s. aethiopicum, is consistent with the number of protein-coding genes described in tomato   <cit>  and in previous works in other plant species. for instance in pepper transcriptome   <cit>   <dig>  out of  <dig>  unigenes were annotated in protein databases as well as  <dig>  out of  <dig>  unigenes in oryza officinalis wall. ex watt  <cit>  and  <dig>  out of  <dig>  unigenes in litchi   <cit> . similarly, in s. melongena and s. torvum  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were annotated, respectively  <cit> .

a large portion of hitless unigenes were short sequences between  <dig> and 500 bp. this huge set of non-annotated short sequences has been observed in recent published transcriptomes, in which large amount of raw reads have been obtained  <cit> . besides 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions  and intron sequences from non-mature mrnas, several authors have described that some of these sequences could be noncoding rnas   <cit> . unfortunately at the present the ncrna is still in their early stages and just some mammalian entries were uploaded to incrna database  <cit> . up to now, the only plant that has received some attention is arabidopsis thaliana where  <dig>  rnas were found transcribed from intergenic regions  <cit> .

gene ontology provides a systematic language in three key biological domains shared by all organisms: molecular function, biological process and cellular component to unify the representation of gene features across all species  <cit> . go terms are structured as a graph and can be distributed in levels. level  <dig> represents the most general categories and provides the most coverage, whereas higher levels provide more specific information and less coverage  <cit> . briefly, level  <dig> is a general description of a process whereas higher levels provide a more specific description.

a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  go terms were assigned to  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes in s. incanum and s. aethiopicum respectively. the go annotation results are presented in additional file  <dig>  the go terms per unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> for s. incanum and from  <dig> to  <dig> for s. aethiopicum, although most of the unigenes have  <dig> to  <dig> go terms . the unigenes were also annotated with ec number  <cit> , which identifies the reactions they catalyze. ec numbers were assigned to  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes, varying from  <dig> to  <dig> per unigene, although almost 80 % presented only one ec number .fig.  <dig> number of go terms per unigene  and number of ec terms per unigene  distribution in s. incanum and s. aethiopicum transcriptomes



the majority of go terms  were related to biological processes . most of them had a go annotation level in the range of  <dig> to  <dig>  biological processes such as oxidation-reduction and metabolic processes, protein phosphorylation and regulation of transcription are usually specific of tissues in a developmental stage  <cit> . molecular functions have been assigned to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of ontologies, most of them showing a go annotation level of  <dig> to  <dig> and being the binding activities the most represented. the remaining  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of annotated unigenes have shown a cellular component go term, mostly related to nucleus, plasma membrane, cytosol, as well as chloroplast and mitochondria. the distribution of go level for this category is quite uniform, with the exceptions of levels  <dig> and  <dig> fig.  <dig> go level distribution  and functional categories annotation  of the s. incanum  and s.aethiopicum  unigenes. on the top are shown the distributions of go level in the following functional categories: biological process, molecular function and cellular component. on the bottom are represented the descriptions of the most abundant gene products for each functional category of go ontologies: biological process, molecular function and cellular component



the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  is an integrated database resource, which links genomic data with functional information to standardize gene annotation  <cit> . using blast2go software the annotated unigenes were blasted against the kegg pathway database in order to dissect the molecular interaction among them. a total of  <dig>   s. incanum unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg biological pathways, involving  <dig> enzyme types and  <dig> ec numbers. regarding s. aethiopicum  <dig>  unigenes  were ascribed to  <dig> kegg pathways, including  <dig> different enzymes and  <dig> ec numbers. in s. incanum the three most enriched pathway were the biosynthesis of antibiotics, which included  <dig> unigenes , made mainly by phosphohexokinase , dehydrogenase  and dehydrogenase   enzymes, purine metabolism pathway  was mostly represented by phosphatase , adenylpyrophosphatase  and rna polymerase  enzymes, and starch and sucrose metabolism pathway  was composed especially by pectin demethoxylase , pectin depolymerase  and udp synthase  enzymes. in s. aethiopicum the most enriched pathway was purine metabolism , which encompasses  <dig> unigenes, mostly constituted by phosphatase , adenylpyrophosphatase  and rna polymerase enzymes , followed by thiamine metabolism pathway , made basically for phosphatase enzymes , and biosynthesis of antibiotics pathway  including  <dig> enzyme types of which the most represented were dehydrogenase , phosphohexokinase  and transaminase  enzymes. the biological pathways maps are reported in the additional file  <dig> and the kegg annotation results are compiled in the additional file  <dig> 

in order to establish a set of orthologs and gene model prediction, a best reciprocal blast hits was performed with the tomato reference genome   <cit> . up to now, the closest phylogenetically published genome of s. incanum and s. aethiopicum is the one of s. melongena  <cit> . even though this first version has provided valuable information for eggplant breeding programs, it is just a draft, requiring a deeper and most complete sequencing. on the other hand, the s. lycopersicum genome is the most complete and accurate in genus solanum. in the last version, sl <dig> , the tomato genome scaffolds were re-ordered and re-oriented, and the gap sizes between scaffolds were set using fish  and optical mapping. for that reason, apart from s. melongena, a blastn was performed against s. lycopersicum. in the additional file  <dig> the blast hits results between the assembled unigenes and s. lycopersicum genome version sl <dig>  are reported. a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes have presented orthologs with tomato reference genome in s. incanum and s. aethiopicum respectively , while between the two transcriptomes  <dig>  orthologs were found.

regarding structural annotation, the orf  detection was performed using estscan software  <cit> , which predicted  <dig>  orfs  in s. incanum. the total number of nucleotides in s. incanum orfs was  <dig> , <dig> . in s. aethiopicum  <dig>  orfs were predicted , which are constituted by  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides . furthermore using est2genome  <cit>  the intron regions were detected, providing valuable information about gene structure as well as in the task of primers design, avoiding regions in the intron edges proximity. in  <dig>  s. incanum unigenes   <dig>  introns were predicted, while  <dig>  introns were detected in  <dig>  s. aethiopicum unigenes  . both species have exhibited an average of  <dig>  introns per unigene with a maximum of  <dig> for s. incanum and  <dig> for s. aethiopicum. the low percentage of introns detected in the unigenes is probably due to that the 60 % of unigenes had between  <dig> and 500 bp and for their small size did not contain any intron.

molecular markers discovery and validation
single nucleotide variations 
during the last decade next-generation sequencing  techniques have allowed the development of large molecular marker collections with modest investments even in non-model species  <cit> . these collections enable the location of thousands of single polymorphisms along the genome as well as the development of high-density genetic maps, arrays and genotyping assays .

although genomic resources have been developed in eggplant , few genomic information is available for closely related species. in the present study, large subsets of snps  and indels  have been identified to assist efficiently plant breeding projects and diversity studies. the snp calling was performed for the species sequenced in the present study  and for the two other species of the eggplant genepool , whose transcriptomes have already been sequenced  <cit> . the reads of the four transcriptomes have been mapped against the eggplant genome and snps detected using freebayes snp caller  <cit> , as detailed in methods section. the complete information of snp calling is provided in additional file  <dig>  a set of  <dig> snvs , three per eggplant chromosome, were selected for validation in the s. incanum and s. aethiopicum accessions using the hrm  technique  <cit> . of these, a total of 96 % were correctly amplified and in all of them polymorphisms detected have been confirmed .

for each of the four species, the intraspecific and interspecific polymorphisms were identified by filtering the vcf  file through the species id number. in addition the indels were separated from the snps applying the vks filter . the results of snp calling are reported in table  <dig>  s. aethiopicum presented the highest value of intraspecific snvs, with  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels. many less intraspecific polymorphisms  were identified in s. incanum. this suggests that the s. aethiopicum accession used presented a larger degree of heterozygosity than the s. incanum accession. finally, in s. melongena and s. torvum  <cit>   <dig> snvs  and  <dig>  snvs  intraspecific polymorphisms were discovered respectively. the high level of intraspecific variation in s. aethiopicum, s. torvum and s. incanum in comparison with s. melongena are probably due to the higher degree of autogamy and breeding selection for uniformity of the latter  <cit> .table  <dig> single nucleotide variations statistics for the s. incanum and s. aethiopicum transcriptomes

snvs  have been identified by the freebayes snp caller. the interspecific and intraspecific variations, as well as all species combination, have been determined by filtering id  species number. every species and species comparison present an unambiguous identification number. the indels have been separated from snps applying the vkf filter to the total snvs. the filtered snps and indels have been obtained by adding the cs <dig>  hv <dig> , cl <dig> and cef filters



the interspecific snvs were detected in the comparisons between two species or three species at the same time. an interspecific snv were selected when the species were homozygous for a specific allele, but different allele from one species to another . the circos plot in fig.  <dig> shows the six combinations of interspecific snvs comparison and the location of the variations in the eggplant genome. as in the case of unigenes distribution along the s. melongena genome, the snvs are less represented in areas which could correspond to centromere and more represented in regions which could correspond to the chromosome arms. solanum torvum presented the greater number of interspecific snvs. a total of  <dig> , <dig> polymorphisms  have been detected in s. torvum,  <dig>  of which are with s. incanum,  <dig>  with s. melongena and  <dig>  with s. aethiopicum. out of the four species, s. torvum is the most phylogenetically distant  <cit> ; this explains the large number of interspecific polymorphisms. solanum melongena presented the second most abundant set of interspecific polymorphisms,  <dig>  snvs . the comparison with s. aethiopicum detected  <dig>  snvs and  <dig>  with s. incanum.fig.  <dig> distribution of interspecific snvs graphically depicted on eggplant genome. the histogram distributions, represented in different colors, illustrate the interspecific variations, two species at a time, along the eggplant genome . from outer to inner are shown: s. incanum vs s. aethiopicum comparison , s. incanum vs s. melongena comparison , s. aethiopicum vs s. melongena comparison , s. incanum vs s. torvum comparison



s. melongena and s. incanum, being members of the eggplant clade  <cit>  we would expect less polymorphisms between these two species than between s. melongena and s. aethiopicum, which belongs to the anguivi clade. this discrepancy could be explained by the high amount of s. aethiopicum intraspecific polymorphisms, which reduces the differences in the number of snvs between s. melongena and s. aethiopicum. finally the lowest variation was found between s. incanum and s. aethiopicum . the interspecific snvs were substantially less abundant when three species were compared. the majority of polymorphisms were indels rather than snps, due to the preferential bi-allelic nature of the latter  <cit> . the collections of variations have been larger in the combinations which included s. melongena and s. torvum, and smaller with s. incanum and s. aethiopicum. in addition  <dig> indels were detected when the four species were compared all together.

subsequently, all intraspecific and interspecific snvs detected in the four species were filtered in order to create subsets of the most suitable and effective variations for genotyping assays, both manually and with high throughput platforms, such as high resolution melting and goldengate assay  <cit> . these variations have well-spaced positions, distanced more than 60 bp from another polymorphism and from the edges of the assembled transcripts. furthermore, they could be detected by digestion with commonly used and cheap restriction enzymes.

ssrs
the transcriptomes were examined to discover ssrs  made of di-, tri-, tetra-nucleotide motifs by using the sputnik software  <cit> . in s. incanum, a set of  <dig> ssrs were identified in  <dig> unigenes; i.e.,  <dig>  % of the unigenes contained at least one microsatellite, while in s. aethiopicum  <dig>  ssrs were detected in  <dig> unigenes . the total number of ssrs yielded was lower than obtained in other studies  <cit> , probably due to the stringent criteria used to obtain high confident markers. the microsatellites identified are summarized in table  <dig>  while their location on eggplant genome is shown in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> ssrs statistics corresponding to the s. incanum and s. aethiopicum transcriptomes

di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeats and motifs identified in the s. incanum and s. aethiopicum assembled unigenes are indicated



the range of ssrs length varied between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in s. incanum and between  <dig> and  <dig> in s. aethiopicum with an average value of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides respectively. the most represented ssrs motifs in both species corresponded to ag, aag and aaag in agreement to the observation in other crops . trinucleotide repeat motifs were the most abundant , followed by dinucleotide  and tetranucleotide  repeats. the prevalence of trinucleotide motifs is well documented in literature in eggplant  <cit>  as well as in other crops  <cit> . metzgar et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that non-triplet ssrs show higher risks of frameshift mutation in coding regions and the selection against these mutations would reduce their chances of fixation. otherwise the selection against frameshift events does not occur in ssrs with a repeat length divisible by three . depending on their position in the gene, ssrs can be involved in different processes. the genic ssrs in 5′-utr are implicated in gene transcription and gene translation while in 3′-utr are implied in gene silencing and transcription slippage. in introns, ssrs can activate and inactivate genes  <cit> . the analysis of localization revealed that most of ssrs were located in orfs,  <dig>  % for s. incanum and  <dig>  % for s. aethiopicum, and less in the utrs . in orfs the trinucleotides repeats were the most abundant , ensuring the conservation of coding capacity and better protection against big changes in frameshift which might cause dramatic effects. on the other hand dinucleotides and tetranucleotides were more abundant in the utrs, showing no great differences between the 5′ and 3′. these results are consistent with previous study in other species  <cit> .table  <dig> ssrs localization in the s. incanum and s. aethiopicum transcriptomes

the ssrs detected in the transcriptomes were checked for their position in the unigenes  according to the nucleotide repeats. when no precise position was established the ssrs were defined as “other”



one polymorphic ssr was selected per chromosome to be validated in s. incanum and s. aethiopicum accessions used for the transcriptome sequencing. eleven out of the  <dig> markers were correctly amplified and resulting polymorphic between the two species . this indicates that the ssrs discovered in this study will provide a valuable set of molecular markers to disclose the intraspecific and interspecific variability across the eggplant genepool. the high rate of snps and ssrs correctly amplified is an indirect evaluation of good transcriptome assembly.

genic ssrs present some advantages in comparison with genomic dna-based markers. for instance, their development from rna-seq projects is low-cost  <cit> . genic ssrs are in many cases functional markers, when changes in allelic repeats affect functions and the phenotype. functional markers permit a direct allele selection, if there is a clear association for a target trait. furthermore, the flanking sequences of genic ssrs are more evolutionary conserved than genomic ssrs  <cit> , allowing considerable cross-species transferability. on the basis of its properties, the uses of genic ssrs are multiple, allowing genome and comparative mapping, genetic diversity analysis, qtl studies, gene tagging, association mapping and functional genomics  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present a de novo assembly and analysis of s. incanum and s. aethiopicum transcriptomes obtained by rna-seq. as a result of the annotation of these two common eggplant relatives, a broad overview of expressed genes was obtained. the annotation of the two transcriptomes has provided valuable information on function and structure of the assembled unigenes, which will allow the detection of candidate genes for important breeding traits in eggplant genepool. the large amount of intraspecific and interspecific molecular markers, genic ssrs and snvs, identified in our transcriptomes and in the s. melongena and s. torvum transcriptomes  <cit> , will be extremely helpful for the breeding programs, although a deeper comparison between the four transcriptome it would be of great interest. in particular filtered snvs will allow accurate genotyping assays through high throughput platforms or arrays increasing the efficiency and rapidity of the programs. overall, the information produced in this study provides a valuable genomic resource in two non-model species, opening the door to further studies as gene tagging, comparative mapping, association mapping for enhancing eggplant genomics and breeding.
