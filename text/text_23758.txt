BACKGROUND
with more than  <dig>  species, the cichlid family is by far the largest fish family. members of this family occupy all sorts of ecological niches everywhere in the world with a remarkable concentration of species in the great african lakes  <cit> . consequently, they constitute a good model for studying evolution and adaptation. also tilapia, o. niloticus, is the second most economically important fish in aquaculture  <cit> . the complete nucleotide sequences of five cichlid genomes have recently been determined: o. niloticus, p. nyererei, h. burtoni, n. brichardi and m. zebra
 <cit> .

all animal species, whatever their ecological niches, have sophisticated systems to sense the outside world for diverse purposes: to avoid attack by predators, to find food and to select appropriate partners to mate and reproduce. several of these biological systems are based on volatile and soluble odorant molecules, and such systems involve olfactory receptors , the first components of these systems to be identified  <cit> . ors are g protein-coupled receptors   <cit> . they are found at the cilia membrane of olfactory neurons  , which are embedded in the olfactory epithelium. the family of genes encoding ors is the largest known gene family, with approximately  <dig> members identified in the genomes of insects and up to around  <dig>  in mammals .

given the importance of the olfactory system in behaviour, it is believed to be important role in shaping species evolution . we therefore tried to identify the complete or gene repertoires of five members of the cichlid family: o. niloticus, p. nyererei, h. burtoni, n. brichardi and m. zebra. these species are potentially good models for evolution studies and their genomes were recently sequenced  <cit> .

RESULTS
cichlid or repertoires
a comprehensive search of the genome sequences of five fishes belonging to the cichlid family  burtoni, neolaprologus brichardi, mitriaclima zebra) was undertaken in order to identify their or gene repertoires. first, we retrieved  <dig> fish or sequences from the literature  <cit>  to construct a query set for tblastn searches of each cichlid genome sequence determined by the broad institute. this search, performed with a cut-off of 1e− <dig>  identified  <dig> candidates or genes distributed over  <dig> contigs. these candidate genes were checked by tblastn against a set of  <dig>  non-or gpcrs to eliminate false positives. the remaining candidate genes were checked with tblastx against the fish protein database .

table  <dig> shows the number of genes identified in each of the five cichlid genomes as well as those of five fish models retrieved from the literature  <cit> , genbank and ensembl databases and after manual curation as part of this study. their nucleotide and amino-acid  sequences and position in the genome are provided in supplementary materials . in addition to complete and potentially functional genes, we identified a number of pseudogenes, edge genes and gene fragments. pseudogenes are common to any olfactory repertoires . or pseudogenes, which are not retrogenes arose by gene duplication and their prevalence in vertebrate genomes is thought to be a consequence of both gene duplication and nucleotide misincorporation during dna replication. they appear to be less numerous in the cichlid family olfactory repertoires than in those of other fish, except zebrafish  <cit> . many  of the pseudogenes we found in the cichlid genomes are due to frameshift mutations, whereas the others are due to a nucleotide misincorporation, changing a sense codon into a stop codon . the distribution of pseudogenes appears to be largely random; they are found in many different subfamilies , whatever their size. fragment genes are sequences with substantial similarity to a restricted part of a functional gene. they have been identified in many complete genome sequences  <cit> . their significance, if any, is unknown. they may correspond to “dead” genes or more prosaically be artefacts generated by sequencing problems. we also identified another type of gene fragments: they are located at the edges of the contigs and correspond to either the 5’ or the 3’ end of an or. as such, they potentially correspond to actual or genes whose sequences were interrupted by genome fragmentation into many contigs. if these genome sequences were completed and the mean contig size, which is currently around  <dig> kb were much longer, we suspect these edge genes would become complete genes, pseudogenes or gene fragments.table  <dig>

ors were classified into families and subfamilies according to the phylogenetic tree and the percentage of aa identity calculated by mafft alignments. families  were named by letters and subfamilies  by arabic numbers . for example, a <dig>  contains  <dig> complete genes,  <dig> edge genes  and  <dig> pseudogene  from n. brichardi. of the  <dig> model fish or   <dig> were in subfamilies also containing one of more cichlid ors.

as shown in this table the  <dig> zebrafish ors are distributed into  <dig> sub-families and  <dig> families. a similar number of sub-families was reported by alioto and ngai  <cit>  analyzing the same set of ors, however they described height families only, four of them corresponding to several families in our study. correspondences between the families in  <cit>  and the families described in this work are as follow: families a, b, c and g described in  <cit>  correspond to families p, ab <dig>  o and l respectively ; families d  <cit>  correspond to ah, m and n; family e  <cit>  corresponds to families f, h, ad, ae, af, ag; family f  <cit>  corresponds to families k and j; family h  <cit>  corresponds to families s, t, u, aj, ak, al and a.



we used mafft  <cit>  and phyml  <cit>  to align the or aa sequences and construct a phylogenetic tree with the or repertoires of the five cichlids and the  <dig> or known aa sequences identified in the genomes of zebrafish , medaka , stickleback , takifugu  and tetraodon  . or repertoires are usually classified into classes, families and subfamilies according to the percentages of aa identity shared by the different ors. in this study, we used the same 40% and 60% aa identity thresholds as proposed by glusman et al.  <cit> . each cichlid contains ors from  <dig> to  <dig> families and between  <dig> and  <dig> subfamilies. there are, however, only  <dig> subfamilies in total indicating that most subfamilies are common to the five cichlids . compared with the or cichlid repertoires, four of the fish model repertoires  have many fewer sub-families  grouped into  <dig> to  <dig> families. however the or zebrafish repertoire appears more similar to the cichlid repertoires with  <dig> sub-families and  <dig> families. thus, among the  <dig> complete cichlid sequences and the  <dig> complete model fish sequences, there are  <dig> subfamilies in all;  <dig> of these subfamilies contain both cichlid  and model fish  sequences . this level of subfamily overlap between the cichlid and the model fish sequences suggests substantial divergence between the cichlid and other teleost repertoires. of interest regarding the evolution of the nile tilapia and lake cichlids is the existence of a number of pairs or triplets and even quadruplets genes sharing 99% or more amino-acid sequence identity . the large number  of or genes sharing 99% aa identity observed between h. burtoni, p. nyereri and m. zebra is in agreement with their close phylogenetic positions  <cit> . compared with this, we found fewer paralogous or pairs except for tilapia for which we identified  <dig> pairs,  <dig> triplet and  <dig> quadruplets of genes with an aa identity above 99%. this last finding is in light of the larger number of ors present in this species. this observation is in agreement with nikaido et al.  <cit>  who, by analyzing the expansion of vomeronasal type  <dig> receptor-like  genes in cichlids, noted that recently duplicated paralogs are more variable than orthologs.figure  <dig>

triplets

quadruplets
olfactory receptors sharing 99% of aa identity were identified from the phylogenetic tree. the greatest numbers of pairs or triplets were found between h. burtoni, m. zebra and p. nyererei, in agreement with their closer phylogenetic relatedness. in o. niloticus  <dig> pairs,  <dig> triplet and  <dig> quadruplets of paralogous genes were identified consistent with this repertoire having undergone a higher level of duplication. the list of genes is shown in additional file  <dig> 

evolution of the dn/ds ratio
the dn/ds ratio also named kaks is commonly used to measure the selective pressure exerted on genes during evolution. we used the nei-gojobori method modified by zhang  <cit>  to calculate this ratio for each pair of or genes from the  <dig> cichlid or families containing four or more genes. the mean dn/ds values for these families extend from  <dig>  for family g, which includes only one subfamily to  <dig>  for family l made of two subfamilies . these values are clearly above the  <dig>  mean value calculated for  <dig>  human rodent orthologous gene pairs  <cit>  and similar to the values obtained for medaka and stickleback or  <cit> . although below  <dig>  the theoretical limit between negative and positive evolution trends, the values obtained indicate a tendency for a positive selection favouring or repertoire diversification as previously noted for other fishes  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . however, it is important to note that the different or pairs behaved very differently. as detailed in additional file  <dig>  we identified a number of or gene pairs with only synonymous mutations as in families a, h and w and or pairs with only non-synonymous mutations as in families a, i and k. table 5b displays the number of or pairs with dn/ds ratios above  <dig>  interestingly, intra-species dn/ds ratios  have values that are similar to those found in inter-species values  as indicated by a ratio close to  <dig>  suggesting a similar evolution of the five cichlid or repertoires .table  <dig>

we also calculated the dn/ds ratio of the different or protein domains  for five families  selected for their high number of genes. as shown in table  <dig> and additional file 7a to f, the dn/ds values are highly variable along the different parts of the molecules with the tm regions having a tendency to be higher, although this is not always the case . on the other hand, no clear tendency can be drawn for the dn/ds ratio of the internal and external loops, although one should note that the standard deviations are very high in all cases, indicating that the various or pairs behaved differently.table  <dig>

conserved amino-acid motifs
ors are gpcrs that belong to the rodhopsin subfamily. they are characterized by a number of aa patterns of which the maydry motif in the internal loop  <dig> is the most characteristic. these patterns have often been used for mining whole genome sequences for or identification  <cit> . we used the meme program  <cit>  to search for the five best motifs for each of the five cichlids and d. rerio. the first four motifs identified for each fish are very similar in both sequence and position between fishes . they are also not very different from those identified in or mammals, despite the substantial distance from any common ancestor  <cit> . however, no clear fifth pattern was identified for the fish ors. ors are transmembrane proteins. although no signal peptide has been identified in their sequences using polyphobius  <cit> , an n-glycosylation site, asn n ser/thr has been detected in all ors identified to date  <cit> . or protein sequences identified in the five cichlid genomes were inspected for the presence of such putative glycosylation sites using netnglycserver  <cit> . for each of them, one to several putative sites were proposed . but interestingly, in all cases, a site with a very high score was present in close proximity to the extracellular n-terminal part in agreement with the importance of the glycosylation site of this region for the correct expression of the or and membrane trafficking  <cit> . or proteins are also characterized by the presence of cysteine residues located at fixed positions in particular in the extracellular loop  <dig> and  <dig>  regions as observed for all d. rerio
 <cit>  and mouse or genes  <cit> . we observed a similar situation for all complete cichlid receptors identified in this study. however, we noted the existence of two subgroups of ors: one subgroup of ors with one cysteine residue only in ec <dig> and one subgroup with three cysteine residues. interestingly, these two groups have slightly different maydry motifs with an e replacing d in the subgroup with one cysteine residue . these two groups differ also by motif  <dig> located in the cytoplasmic c terminal extremity. whether these differences affect the recognition and binding of the g alpha subunit and the transduction signal is a matter of interest  <cit> .figure  <dig>

weblogo representation of the aa conservation around the maydry motif. multiple alignment with mafft followed by phyml clustering revealed two subgroups of cichlid or: one with a classical maydry motif followed by  <dig> cysteine residues indicated by a blue star; and a second with an altered maydry motif in which the aspartate residue  is replaced by a glutamate residue . see additional file  <dig> for the genes of each of these two groups and a complete alignment of their sequences.



moreover, these feature inspections of aa alignments  made it possible to identify a number of positions occupied by the same or nearly the same aa, pointing to positions submitted to strong purifying constraint during evolution like, for example, another cysteine residue in the n terminal extension also previously noted  <cit> .

spliced or genes
our searches for or genes unexpectedly identified a number of spliced ors. among the  <dig> complete or genes identified in the five cichlids,  <dig> ors  consist of two to four coding exons . proof that these spliced cichlid or genes are functional will require transcriptional and functional analysis. nevertheless, there are four types of evidence indicating that they are active or genes:  the splice site junctions,  the intron position,  the blastx analysis and  their position within the phylogenetic tree. i. exon-intron boundaries. nucleotide sequences overlapping the exon-intron boundaries were identified by the alignment of the spliced or sequences with their cognate contig sequences. with the meme suite, we identified two nucleotide motifs  defining exon boundaries while maintaining the reading frames open through the junction of the adjacent exons. interestingly, these two motifs are similar to those found at mammalian gene exon/intron boundaries  <cit> . most of these donor/acceptor sites were also predicted by the fsplice program  <cit>  with the fish model weight matrix .

ii. introns were in nearly the same positions in all the ors : by comparing the gene nucleotide sequences and the amino acid sequences, we inferred the intron position relative to the 2d or structure  and noticed a nearly fixed position . in  <dig> of the  <dig> or genes with one intron interrupting the coding frame, the intron is in phase  <dig> and in phase  <dig> for the remaining; also for  <dig>  the intron is within the sequence encoding the maydry motif in the first internal loop. similarly, of the  <dig> or genes with two introns within the coding sequence, first intron is in the sequence encoding the extracellular part in five, and in the sequence encoding internal loop  <dig> in a further five. all  <dig> or genes with two introns have their distal intron in the sequence encoding external loop  <dig> 

iii. blastx analysis. all proteins identified by tblastn search were subjected to a blastx search against the non-redundant ncbi protein database. only proteins giving a strong hit with or proteins, and no hits or a meaningless hit with other gpcrs, were kept as true ors.

iv. phylogenetic analysis. the aa sequences of  <dig> cichlid ors and of  <dig> non or class a  gpcrs identified in genbank were aligned with mafft, and a tree constructed with phyml and drawn with figtree  <cit>  . all ors, with one or several coding exons, clearly form a separate branch from the non or class a gpcrs; this argues for them being true or genes and not another type of gpcr. most of the spliced cichlid ors  cluster in families or subfamilies not shared by ors with only one coding exon. also, the spliced or genes are grouped according to the number of their coding exons. for example, family w is made up of  <dig> ors all with two coding exons, whereas families i and u contain six and five ors, respectively, all with three coding exons . the clustering of the ors with two or more coding exons into particular families indicates that splice or genes arose before cichlid speciation and have evolved independently from single coding-exon ors. however, the possibility that there was horizontal transfer cannot be formally excluded.

CONCLUSIONS
the olfactory system enables animals to sense the outside world and contributes to searching for food and sexual partners. it may also help prevent or avoid attack by enemies and predators. as such, olfaction is a vital function. olfactory receptors  are transmembrane proteins found on the surface of olfactory neurons, and are the first component of the olfactory transduction cascade. they bind odorant molecules inducing a cascade of protein interactions that transform a primary chemical signal into an electrical signal that is conveyed to the brain; there, it is decoded and stored, leading to an appropriate response  <cit> . here, we report the identification of repertoires of or genes in the genomes of five cichlids, recently sequenced by a consortium led by the broad institute  <cit> .

to identify these five olfactory repertoires as completely as possible, we applied the strategy used by alioto and ngai  <cit>  for the analysis of the zebrafish or repertoire. we performed an exhaustive tblastn search for sequences corresponding to a set of fish olfactory receptors retrieved from the literature  <cit> . although, all or genes previously found in vertebrates consist of an uninterrupted open reading frame  , we did not limit our search to positive hits longer than  <dig> nucleotides as alioto and ngai did  <cit> . rather, we retrieved all hits with an e-value cut-off of 1e− <dig>  we then checked each of these candidate genes or gene fragments against a set of non-or non-taar class a gpcr sequences. all genes retained as true ors shared a number of predicted properties characterizing this class of molecule  <cit> : an extracellular n-terminal extremity, seven hydrophobic transmembrane stretches of  <dig> to  <dig> amino-acids each, and an intracellular c-terminal extremity . they have an n-glycosylation site, asn n ser/thr, near the n-terminus involved in addressing these proteins to the cellular membrane  <cit> .

characteristic amino-acid motifs have been identified in all ors. these patterns of aa as well as their localization inside the molecules have often been used as a means for retrieving the corresponding genes from newly determined genome sequences  <cit> . in the present study, we started with a different perspective that consisted in the characterization of these proteins as actual or and not in their mining. we identified with meme, four aa motifs, shared by the five cichlids as well as d. rerio. although, minute variations can be observed when comparing the different motifs between these fishes, they looked very much the same. interestingly, some striking similarities can be observed with the aa motifs characterizing rat and dog ors  <cit> . finally, we noted the presence of cysteine residues at positions shared by all ors . these residues are of prime importance for the correct folding of proteins and mutations changing these cysteine residues into another aa have been shown to often impair their function  <cit> . moreover, these alignments enable the identification of regions or amino-acid positions strongly conserved and others highly variable, such as in the ligand binding pocket  <cit> . the birth and death hypothesis as previously described  <cit>  with a relaxed purifying selection favouring multiple amino-acid changes explains the large repertoire of ors found in numerous species  as well as their partition in many families and subfamilies. their multiplicity, which enables the detection of a large number of odorant molecules, favours the search for food or sexual partners and as such, is a good observer of evolution. considering the size of the or repertoires, even in the absence of formal and definitive numbers owing to the non-completeness of the genome sequences, it appears that the numbers of potentially active or genes found in these five cichlids would be higher than those identified in other teleosts  <cit> , except zebrafish. in addition, fewer pseudogenes were identified in the cichlid genomes, even if one cannot exclude that some of the edge genes could in fact correspond to pseudogenes. but perhaps more importantly from an evolutionary point of view, the or cichlid repertoires are dispersed in many more sub-families, than most of the teleost repertoires except for zebrafish  nevertheless, despite this substantial variability of or sequences, there are numerous ors which share more than 99% aa sequence identity between species .

the discovery of a subset of or genes in the cichlid genomes made of more than one coding exon came as a surprise. while or genes belong to class a of the gpcr superfamily within which numerous genes are made of several coding exons, based on their original discovery, it was assumed that vertebrate or genes were made of two exons, a 5’ non-coding exon and a second exon encompassing an orf coding for a protein of 300– <dig> aa  <cit> . it was due to this belief that several authors mining genome sequences restricted their search to long orf or eliminated short orf afterwards  <cit> .

definitive proof of their status as or will be provided by functional studies, implying rna transcription analysis of olfactory epithelium and identification, at least for some of their ligands. obviously, such studies are out of the scope of the present paper. there are several arguments, in particular the results of the blast analysis and their phylogenetic positions  strongly indicate these multi-coding exon genes code actual ors. functional studies are required for a conclusive demonstration that these sequences are indeed active or genes. this will probably involve analysis of rna transcription in olfactory epithelium and identification, at least for some of them, of their ligands. such studies are beyond the scope of the present paper. nevertheless, our work provides several arguments, in particular the results of the blast analysis and the phylogenetic positions of the sequences  and  in the results section), strongly indicating that these multi-coding exon genes indeed encode true ors.

we performed a tblastn search to determine whether these multi-coding exon genes are specific to the cichlids or whether they had been overlooked during the mining of other fish genomes. we searched the or fish repertoires in ncbi and ensembl databases with a set of cichlid multi-exon or gene sequences. we also inspected, one by one, the aa and gene sequences of the medaka, stickleback and zebrafish or genes in the ensembl database. a number of or genes made up of two or more coding exons were found in various fish species . these preliminary findings strongly suggest that ors in many fishes, and not only cichlids, can be encoded by multi-coding exon genes.

given the fact that invertebrate  <cit>  and some fish ors could have more than one coding exon, a more general question would be, why do mammal ors have only one coding exon and are the only subgroup of gpcrs with this characteristic? would the peptides, corresponding to one or a subset of exons that made multicoding exon or genes, have an additional function lost during mammalian evolution and leading to the loss of these or genes? would some rna transcripts, corresponding to a subset of exons and with no real coding capacity, regulate the expression of their corresponding or mrna? these are matters of speculation.
