BACKGROUND
biological control bacteria regulate the capacity of plants to resist pathogen attack through diverse mechanisms
 <cit> . recently, zhang et al.  showed that bacteria-responsive plant micrornas regulate plant innate immunity by modulating the plant hormone network
 <cit> . phytohormones are key determinants of a plants’ ability to tolerate abiotic and biotic stress . they are the effector molecules responsible for signal perception/transduction, cellular homeostasis and gene expression. as a consequence, they play an important role in plant responses to, and resistance against, disease.

hormones and hormone-synthetic analogs have been used to prime plants such that they are prepared to mount defence responses against various pathogens. the induced systemic resistance  pathway is stimulated during necrotrophic bacterial attack and is primed by biocontrol species such as pseudomonas to protect the plant from pending attack, possibly by increasing the plants susceptibility to the isr-regulating hormone jasmonic acid 
 <cit> . the priming of the isr response is linked to ja and ethylene , yet significant accumulation of these hormones has not been reported in isr-expressing plants
 <cit> . bacterium-mediated isr is not dependent upon the induction of the defence hormone salicylic acid , at least for the rhizobacterium strain p. fluorescens wcs417r
 <cit> . application of the auxin β-aminobutyric acid resulted in induced resistance to alternaria brassicola and priming for callose deposition and resistance
 <cit> . priming of callose deposition was dependent on the classical plant defence hormone abscisic acid . other hormones such as the the auxin indole acetic acid , cytokinins and brassinosteroids modulate host defence responses
 <cit> , but have not yet been specifically linked to defence priming.

a number of p. fluorescens strains have already been reported to prime plants by initiating defence responses to subsequent pathogen attacks
 <cit> . p. fluorescens strain mkb <dig> had the ability to induce local and systemic responses in wheat and barley tissue, resulting in enhanced resistance to fusarium seedling blight and head blight  disease
 <cit> . the objective of this study was to determine what hormones are involved in the defence responses to fhb in barley that are primed by the bacterium p. fluorescens strain mkb <dig>  based on in silico analysis of the upstream regions of genes involved in the primed response
 <cit>  we chose to determine whether the hormones aba and iaa play a role in the biocontrol of fhb disease by p. fluorescens. based on the assessment of both hormone levels and their effect on both the regulation of plant genes activated by the biocontrol bacterium and the development of fhb disease symptoms, we draw conclusions regarding the contribution of iaa and aba to the local defence responses of barley plants primed by p. fluorescens. furthermore, we highlight the potential of iaa as a treatment for the control of fhb disease.

RESULTS
aba- and ga-responsive elements are highly represented in potentiated genes
we previously identified  <dig> barley genes that were primed by p. fluorescens to respond to f. culmorum <cit> . barley genome sequence was available for  <dig>  of these genes . in silico analysis of upstream promoter regions indicated that  <dig> of these contained hormone-responsive elements . aba- and ga-responsive elements were detected in all of these upstream regions, aba being most commonly detected  . elements responsive to the hormones aux/iaa and sa were also frequent, being detected in  <dig> and 56% of putative promoter regions, respectively. ja-responsive elements were identified within the upstream region of a histone h <dig> gene and genes involved in defence - glutathiones, peroxidases, mla <dig> and pdr-type abc transporters.

aba and iaa levels are modulated by both the biocontrol agent and the pathogen
experiments were conducted in order to determine if aba or iaa accumulation varied during the early stages of fhb disease development in barley and if this was affected by application of the biocontrol bacterium p. fluorescens . aba was produced in response to both bacterium and fungal treatment as early as  <dig> h post-pathogen treatment. aba production  was induced by both bacterial and fungal treatment. noteworthy was the fact that at any of the time points tested, aba levels in plants treated with both the bacterium plus fungus were not significantly different from the levels determined in the bacterium-treated plants . the combined effects of both agents on aba accumulation were neither additive nor synergistic. aba production peaked at  <dig> h post-fungal inoculation and by  <dig> h it had not returned to basal levels.

similar to aba, iaa was produced in response to both p. fluorescens and f. culmorum as early as  <dig> h post-pathogen treatment. unlike aba, additive effects of the bacterium and fungus on hormone accumulation could account for the levels of iaa detected in plants treated with both agents at  <dig> h; at  <dig> h effects were at least additive and potentially synergistic . by  <dig> h post-fusarium inoculation, iaa production levels were  <dig> -fold higher in bacterium as compared to control samples and  <dig> -fold greater than the fungus samples . but iaa levels were  <dig> -fold higher in plants treated with both bacterium and fungus as compared to control plants . similar results were observed at  <dig> h post-fungal inoculation. but, by  <dig> h post-fungal inoculation, iaa levels were similar across all treatments  .

bacterium-potentiated genes are up-regulated in response to both iaa and aba
previously we discriminated two set of plant genes activated in response to p. fluorescens strain mkb158; one set were transcriptionally activated by the bacterium alone and the other set were primed by the bacterium to respond to the pathogen f. culmorum, respectively known as bacterium-responsive and bacterium-potentiated genes
 <cit> . we hypothesised that if either aba or iaa were involved in priming then, in pathogen-treated heads, they may up-regulate potentiated genes but not necessarily bacterium-responsive genes. potentiated genes studied were defence genes nsltp, ci-1b, tip3: <dig>  paz <dig> and znmt <cit> . bacterium-responsive genes studied were nced  and f. culmorum treated barley heads from  <dig> to  <dig> h post-treatment . gene expression was highest at  <dig> –  <dig> h post-treatment with pathogen or tween <dig> . in the absence of the pathogen, both aba and iaa up-regulated most genes but transcript levels were generally much lower than in pathogen-treated heads . in pathogen-inoculated heads, both iaa and aba significantly up-regulated the potentiated genes and nced  . pi <dig> was potentiated by aba and by iaa to respond to f. culmorum, although the effects of aba were more immediate and greater . aba effects on gene expression in pathogen-treated tissue were generally more immediate than those of iaa, with the exception of znmt and nced. znmt was the most iaa-responsive gene; it was the transcript that accumulated to the highest levels and, by  <dig> h post-fungal treatment, it was up-regulated  <dig> fold in heads treated with fusarium plus iaa as compared to fusarium alone  .

exogenous application of iaa reduces fhb disease in barley
experiments were conducted in order to determine the effect of iaa and aba application to barley heads on both visual symptoms and yield loss caused by the subsequent inoculation with f. culmorum. pathogen inoculation resulted in 30% of spikelets displaying symptoms by gs  <dig> and a  <dig> % reduction in  <dig> grain weight . aba did not significantly reduce the disease symptoms or yield loss caused by the pathogen . on the contrary, iaa reduced disease levels by 60% and negated the yield losses caused by the pathogen . grains were visually similar to those obtained for control plants ; in general they did not display the fungal growth and shrinkage evident in grains treated with pathogen  or aba + pathogen .

no evidence that iaa and aba directly inhibit fungal growth in vitro
an in vitro plate assay was conducted in order to assess the effect of hormone supplementation on pda on the growth of f. culmorum strain fcf <dig> . irrespective of the hormone concetration used, neither iaa nor aba significantly affected the growth of the fungus, relative to control plates .

discussion
the importance of the hormones iaa and aba as effectors molecules involved in the regulation of a variety of plant physiological mechanisms is well reported  and sar responses
 <cit> .

auxin production was part of the response primed by p. fluorescens to respond to fusarium infection and iaa reduced the severity of disease symptoms and associated yield loss when applied  <dig> h pre-pathogen. the increases in iaa observed herein in biocontrol plus pathogen treated tissue precede disease spread and thus are part of an early priming cascade activated in response to plant-pathogen contact. we found no evidence that either iaa or aba inhibited fungal growth on pda. p. fluorescens strain mkb <dig> has the capacity to produce auxin
 <cit> , as do fusarium fungi
 <cit> . based on the literature
 <cit> , it is very possible that the iaa is derived from the bacterium and/or pathogen rather than the plant; the application of iaa might trick the plant into thinking it is being attacked by the pathogen, thus priming the defences responses such that they are activated to respond rapidly to the pathogen and thus increase plant fhb resistance. fusarium culmorum displays a hemibiotrophic lifestyle
 <cit>  and there is evidence that auxin signalling enhances resistance to necrotrophs but susceptibility to biotrophs
 <cit> . noticeably, a recent report
 <cit>  highlights how auxin application was able to reverse hypersensitive response programmed cell death in tobacco initiated by a erwinia amylovora type iii elicitor harpin
 <cit> . in a recent metabolomics study reports by kumaraswamy et al. , f. graminearum induced the accumulation of iaa in barley
 <cit> .

most evidence points to aba playing a negative role in plant disease resistance, although there are exceptions, particularly for necrotrophic pathogens . but, it has a negative effect on some necrotrophs and therefore the role of aba in the host response in not solely determined by the pathogen lifestyle. the predominance of aba-responsive elements in the upstream region of primed genes, the previous association between aba and primed biocontrol responses
 <cit> , its association with diverse pathogen resistances
 <cit>  and the increased aba levels in bacterium and pathogen treated plants all provide “circumstantial” evidence that this hormone might play a role in the interplay between fusarium and barley. furthermore, there is evidence for a link between aba and fhb resistance: callose deposition and repression of ethylene signalling are associated with aba
 <cit>  and also with resistance to fusarium spread in wheat spikelets
 <cit> . both the biocontrol agent and pathogen induced the accumulation of similar levels of aba, indicating that any quantitative effects of this hormone on biotic responses are general rather than organism-specific. aba itself did not reduce the severity of fhb. iaa activates the expression of the aba biosynthetic gene nced, as found by us and others
 <cit> . thus it is conceivable that application of iaa activates aba-associated defences, but the converse does not occur; this warrants investigation. it could also be that the timing of application of aba and the activation associated defence cascades were not optimal for disease control.

CONCLUSIONS
defence responses are finely modulated by multiple hormones and herein we report of how the application of a biocontrol bacteria activated the in planta biosynthesis of two fundamental hormones, aba and iaa. studies that focus on the effect of specific components of iaa biosynthesis, homeostasis and turnover on defence priming will greatly enhance our understanding of how biocontrol pseudomonads can be used more effectively to control plant diseases. this study has identified iaa as a method for controlling fhb disease. other studies have shown that iaa can reduce the severity of fusarium seedling blight disease of wheat and barley . interestingly, it has been associated with systemic acquired immunity
 <cit>  and it has protective effects against apple scab caused by the necrotroph botrytis cineria when applied pre- but not when applied post-pathogen
 <cit> . iaa might offer a realistic treatment for the control of diseases such as fhb where crops have a limited and clearly defined infection . thus the effect of iaa on mycotoxin accumulation in grain and on other agronomic parameters are worthy of investigation.
