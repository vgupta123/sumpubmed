BACKGROUND
serial passage of bacteria with exposure to rifampicin may result in rifampicin-resistant microorganisms that may be useful as live-attenuated vaccines  <cit> . rifampicin  is a potent, broad-spectrum antibiotic from the rifamycin group that inhibits the β-subunit of prokaryotic dna-dependent rna polymerase . the antibiotic acts by directly blocking elongation of mrna transcripts and drug resistance is normally conferred by point mutations in rpob gene that encodes the β-subunit of the rnap , although alternative mechanisms of rifampicin resistance have been described  <cit> . recently, rifampicin passage was used to generate live-attenuated vaccines against a number of bacterial diseases of fish including columnaris disease, edwardsiellosis, enteric septicemia of catfish and motile aeromonad septicemia  or brucellosis in cattle  <cit> . similarly, a live-attenuated strain csf259-93b. <dig> of f. psychrophilum was developed by passage with rifampicin and infection with this strain induces a protective immune response in rainbow trout  against challenge with the virulent parent csf 259– <dig> strain  <cit> . further analysis of the csf259-93b. <dig>  strain revealed a point mutation in the rpob gene and numerous proteomic changes as compared to the parent strain  <cit> .

although the method of passaging pathogens with rifampicin has been successfully used to generate live vaccines for more than two decades, the mechanism of attenuation from this procedure remains unknown. that is, it is not clear if loss of virulence is directly associated with point mutations within the rpob gene that confer resistance to rifampicin, or if accumulation of random mutations resulting from repeated passages with antibiotic selection pressure lead to attenuation, or perhaps a combination of both . this is an important question because knowing the mechanisms of attenuation provides information to better assess the likelihood that an attenuated strain might revert to a virulent phenotype in the future. furthermore, knowing the mechanisms involved could lead to more efficient strategies to develop live-attenuated strains that do not rely on random chance.

in this study we passaged two pathogenic strains of f. psychrophilum, csf 259– <dig> and thc 02– <dig>  on media with and without rifampicin, and applied next-generation genome sequencing techniques and other methods to analyze changes associated with these culture conditions. the choice of these two strains was based on the fact that they belong to two distinct genetic lineages of f. psychrophilum  <cit> , and that both are highly virulent to salmonids. these characteristics make these strains suitable for bacterial challenge in our rainbow trout model for assessment of attenuation of passaged strains  <cit> .

RESULTS
growth comparison
growth kinetics of the parent f. psychrophilum strains  and strains passaged with and without rifampicin were determined in tyes broth at 16 °c and assessed with endpoint optical density measurements and the area-under-the-curve  comparisons . in general, the parental strains  grew slightly faster than their passaged counterparts, but only the cr strain grew significantly slower when compared to its parental cw strain . for thc 02– <dig> strains, even though the wild-type tw strain exhibited slightly better growth, there was no statistical difference between growth rates of tw, tn and tr strains for both endpoint od and auc measurements. all measurements of growth included three independent biological replicates per strain.fig.  <dig> growth curves of f. psychrophilum csf 259– <dig> and thc 02– <dig> parent and passaged strains. independent triplicates of each strain were grown statically in tyes broth at 16 °c with optical density measurements at 450–580 nm preceded by brief shacking. abbreviations used: cw - f. psychrophilum csf 259– <dig> parent strain, cn and cr – csf 259– <dig> passaged  <dig> times with no and with rifampicin, respectively; b <dig> – rifampicin attenuated f. psychrophilum csf 259-93b. <dig> strain  <cit> ; tw - thc 02– <dig> parent strain and tn and tr – thc 02– <dig> passaged for  <dig> times with and without rifampicin, respectively



cell and colony morphology
gram staining and microscopy showed no apparent differences in size or shape of cells from the six f. psychrophilum strains . when grown on tyes agar the cr strain exhibited reduced yellow pigmentation compared with the cw and cn strains . additionally, when cultured on gliding motility agar the cr colonies showed decreased spreading indicative of impaired gliding motility . there was no obvious motility impairment for the remaining strains and the tr strain appeared to be the most motile. from a qualitative perspective, all three thc 02– <dig> strains appeared to be more motile than the csf 259– <dig> strains.fig.  <dig> light micrographs showing representative colony edges after 3-day incubation at 16 °c on gliding motility agar. cw – wild-type csf  <dig> ; cn – csf 259– <dig> passaged without rifampicin; cr– csf 259– <dig> passaged with rifampicin; b <dig> – attenuated csf  <dig> b.17; tw – wild-type thc 02–90; tn – thc 02– <dig> passaged without rifampicin; tr – thc 02– <dig> passaged with rifampicin; white bars indicate 200 μm scale



rpob mutations
analysis of rpob mutations from rifampicin resistant cr, tr and b <dig> strains obtained through genome sequencing, validated later using sequencing of pcr amplified rpob , revealed the presence of point mutations that are distinctive for these three strains. while the completely attenuated b <dig> strain harbors a gln474arg mutation, the rpob of the cr strain is changed at ser492phe. the rpob gene of the tr strain has a double mutation with asp477tyr and pro496ser substitutions .

carbohydrate and protein characterization
bacterial proteinase-k digested carbohydrate extractions and whole-cell lysates were prepared from each strain and analyzed by sds-page and 2d page, respectively. there were no visible differences in lps banding patterns among the six strains, although there were visual differences in band intensities . proteomic analysis of the cn strain showed increased synthesis of a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 25 kda as compared to its parent strain. additionally, whole-cell lysates the cr strain revealed that synthesis of three proteins of  <dig>   <dig> and 200 kda was qualitatively increased. both tn and tr appeared to have increased expression of a similar protein with approximate molecular mass of 35 kda when compared to their parent tw strain .fig.  <dig> 2d page analysis of whole-cell lysates from the f. psychrophilum strains. proteins were stained with sypro ruby gel stain and molecular weight markers  are indicated on the left of each gel. red ovals designate proteins reproducibly greater abundance as compared to the respective  parent strain. cw – wild-type csf  <dig> ; cn – csf 259– <dig> passaged without rifampicin; cr– csf 259– <dig> passaged with rifampicin; b <dig> – attenuated csf  <dig> b.17; tw – wild-type thc 02–90; tn – thc 02– <dig> passaged without rifampicin; tr – thc 02– <dig> passaged with rifampicin

dna methylation analysis
we used allora ec assemblies from the pacific biosciences sequencer to evaluate different dna methylation patterns for cr and tr strain. rs allora assembly ec. <dig> protocol of smrt portal version  <dig> . <dig> was used. reads shorter than 100 bp and with quality below  <dig>  were discarded. postfiltered reads for the cr strain consisted of 385 mb in  <dig>  reads. the reads had an average length of 3581 bp and an average quality of  <dig> . 100 % of the reads were assembled into  <dig> contigs with a sum of  <dig>  mb, a max contig size of  <dig>  and an n <dig> of  <dig> . postfiltered reads for the tr strain had an average quality of  <dig>  and totaled 449 mb in  <dig>  reads averaging 3590 bp. one hundred percent of the reads assembled into  <dig> contigs with a sum of  <dig>  mb and a max contig size of  <dig>  bp and an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp. dna methylation was detected on both  <dig> contig assemblies and the corresponding motifs were identified with rs modification and motif analysis. <dig> protocol of smrt portal version  <dig> . <dig> 

upon release of smrt portal version  <dig> . <dig> the existing pacbio data was reassembled using the rs hgap assembly  <dig> protocol. for the strain cr, less strict filtering allowed 830 mb of data to enter the assembly with an average read length of 3658 bp and average quality of  <dig> . preassembly yield was  <dig>  on a self-calculated minimum seed read size of 8038 bp, and generated 54 mb in  <dig> pre-assembled reads with an n <dig> of 8649 bp. the celera assembler component of the hgap algorithm assembled the pre-assembled reads into a single contig. quiver was used to polish the assembly and found consensus concordance of  <dig>  % with uniform 210× coverage and a polished contig size of  <dig> ,139 bp. for the strain tr, 927 mb of data entered the assembly with an average read length of 3720 bp and average quality of  <dig> . preassembly yield was  <dig>  on a self-calculated minimum seed read size of 8480 bp, and generated  <dig>  mb in  <dig> pre-assembled reads with an n <dig> of 8987 bp. hgap assembled the pre-assembled reads into two contigs. quiver was used to polish the assembly and found consensus concordance of  <dig>  % with uniform 232× coverage and polished contig sizes of  <dig> ,854 bp and  <dig>  bp.

discussion
repeated laboratory passage of pathogens in the presence of rifampicin has been used to generate live-attenuated vaccines , but the mechanism of rifampicin-induced attenuation remains unknown. there are a variety of potential confounding factors with this type of passage experiment that make cause-and-effect interpretations challenging. passage can produce changes in global protein expression profiles  <cit>  or altered lipopolysaccharide  biosynthesis/colony roughness  <cit> . these changes could be attributed to altered activity of rpob in the rif resistant dna-dependent rna polymerase  present in rifampicin resistant bacteria  <cit> . that is, the presence and activity of the mutated rpob is one hypothesis for the mechanism of attenuation. alternatively, rifampicin-associated attenuation may result from accumulation of spontaneous mutations acquired in the course of in vitro passaging. serial passage of a pathogenic bacterium without any antibiotics can also induce changes in lps profile and colony roughness, which have been correlated with attenuation  <cit> . this finding is consistent with the role of random mutations in the attenuation process, although the rate of mutation may differ depending on the stress imposed on the passaged microorganism  <cit> . for example, for the current study the two strains that were passaged with rifampicin, cr and tr, accumulated more snps compared to their matched strains that were passaged without the antibiotic .

in the present study, passage did not affect in vitro growth characteristics except for the cr strain, which was compromised to some extent . others have reported that acquisition of rifampicin resistance can negatively impact growth rates although this probably depends on the exact mutation that is acquired in rpob . when grown as a colony on agar plates, the cr colonies had smooth edges and the cr strain lacked gliding motility, both changes that could be explained by either altered function of a mutated rpob or other snps in relevant genes. for example, colonies of the cr grown on tyes and gma media have reduced yellow pigmentation compared to the cw and cn strains. this phenotype may be attributed to the thr365lys mutation in the phytoene desaturase  gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in flavobacterium sp. . microscopic analysis of gliding motility and colony morphologies of tw, tn and tr strains did not reveal any phenotypic changes, despite the large number of snps that were accumulated by the tn and tr strains.

polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of lps fractions revealed no obvious differences in lps profiles, including no apparent changes from an ile376leu substitution in o-antigen acetylase  in the tr strain. 2d-page analyses of proteins revealed probable differences in protein synthesis among rifampicin resistant f. psychrophilum strains , which is consistent with our previous studies  <cit> . it is important to emphasize that while rpob mutations might alter transcriptional regulation, other mutations in these strains could have contributed to this effect. specifically, snps in proteins directly involved in gene/protein expression such as dna primase, ribosome recycling factor, elongation factor p , atp-dependent rna helicase  in the b <dig> or transcriptional regulator fpsm_ <dig> and atp-dependent rna helicase dbpa  in the tr strain.

remarkably, considerable reduction in virulence of the cn  and cr  strains occurred despite relatively few snps leading to nonsynonymous amino acid changes . there were overlapping synonymous mutations among these strains and synonymous snps have been reported to potentially affect protein function  <cit> . aside from snps occurring in the rpob sequence, there was no overlap in snps for the attenuated b <dig> strain and the cr and cn strains developed in the current project. noteworthy,  <dig> genes  out of  <dig> that harbor snps in the cn strain are identical with the cr strain. we surmise that the probability of these identical snps arising independently is unlikely. instead, they most likely arose from the original culture used to initialize the passage experiments , or a cross-over contamination event occurred sometime early in the course of the experiment; if this was a contamination event, it must have occurred early in the experiment because these strains have distinct rpob mutations making it easy to differentiate the final cultures. one of these shared snps is in nrda, which has been implicated in pathogenesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . additionally, in escherichia coli yiha is a gtpase that is essential for normal cell morphology and coordination of division; thus snps in this gene may contribute to attenuation  <cit> . because adhesion is an essential process in host-pathogen interaction and pathogenesis, mutation in the putative membrane spanning protein fpsm_ <dig> may have a direct effect on reduced virulence of cn and cr strains. collectively, these findings are consistent with involvement of mutational events in the process of attenuation.

the cr strain was mostly attenuated  and was characterized by slower growth in culture, lost gliding motility, three observable changes in protein synthesis, and altered carotenoid metabolism that is probably due to mutated phytoene desaturase . as part of a gene cluster involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, mutations in ctri were shown to alter colony pigmentation of other pathogens  <cit> . importantly, mutations of ctr genes are able to decrease resistance to oxygen radicals and reduce growth in macrophages of the fish pathogen, mycobacterium marinum  <cit> . additionally, golden pigment synthesized through carotenoid pathway in staphylococcus aureus enhances virulence by promoting resistance to respiratory burst of neutrophils, and the ∆crtm strain of s. aureus was also attenuated in mice model  <cit> .

additional snps unique to the attenuated cr strain included those found in a hypothetical protein , a transcriptional regulator  and the ser492phe substitution in rpob. the fpsm_ <dig> hypothetical protein has a predicted function of an n-acetylglucosamine  kinase, an enzyme important for bacterial cell wall and lps metabolism. moreover, importance of nag metabolism was implied in initiation of murine intestine colonization by e. coli  <cit>  and in bacterial signaling and growth in mucus of p. aeruginosa  <cit> . together, these missense mutations may affect the virulence of the cr strain and its ability to colonize host and survive in challenged fish. in our analysis, however, we cannot discount the possible effects of silent snps on phenotype changes as described by kimchi-safraty and co-workers  <cit> .

our alternative hypothesis that rpob can be directly involved in attenuation is potentially supported by the fact that rpob is crucial in bacterial transcription and allosteric changes of the mutant protein may produce global alterations such as phenotype changes. the potential involvement of rpob ser492phe mutation in attenuation of the cr strain is supported by existence of phenotypic  and proteomic changes, and by a gln474arg rpob mutation in the completely attenuated b <dig> strain  <cit> . furthermore, in other bacteria different rpob mutations lead to different phenotypic changes . in brucella spp. virulence and colony roughness of rifr phenotypes also varied depending on the position and character of single amino acid substitutions of rpob  <cit> . mutations providing resistance to rifampicin are clearly not universally responsible for attenuation because presumptively virulent rifr strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis have been described .

unlike attenuated strains derived from csf 259– <dig>  the tn and tr strains from wild-type thc 02– <dig> accumulated a large number of snps from serial passage regardless of the presence of rifampicin, and yet these changes had no apparent effect on virulence. the large numbers of snps present in the tn and tr strains as compared to the cn and cr strains may be attributed to the fact that the csf 259– <dig> and thc 02– <dig> belong to different genetic lineages of f. psychrophilum. these two lineages are generally associated with different fish hosts, and the lineage to which thc 02– <dig> belongs is amenable to some genetic manipulations, which have not been successful with the lineage of strains to which csf 259– <dig> belongs . it is notable that  <dig> and 46 % of the nonsynonymous mutations found in the tn and tr strains, respectively, occurred in subtilisin-like proteases that are putative cell surface proteins with predicted leucine-rich repeats. repeat regions in dna sequences are notoriously difficult to assemble correctly; particularly when using short read technologies such as employed herein  <cit> . notably, however, these same regions are also found in the csf 259– <dig> genome and yet there were no mutations found in these gene sequences for the cn and cr strains. given that all of these passaged strains introduced in this study were developed and sequenced at the same time using the same chemistries, we submit that this is not a sequencing artifact but that there is probably a distinctly different mutation process underway between the csf 259– <dig> strains and the thc 02– <dig> strains. more strains from the two lineages need to be tested to determine if this is a lineage-level difference or if thc 02– <dig> is unique in this regard.

additional changes at the snp level, such as a snp in nrda in cr, and mutation in the fpsm_ <dig> gene encoding multimodular transpeptidase-transglycosylase pbp 1a and mrec in the b <dig> also support a mutation-dependent attenuation hypothesis because these genes have been associated with virulence . alternatively, if rpob mutation is more important, then the exact position of the mutations may be important. for example, tr was not attenuated, but it also had distinctly different mutations in the rpob  as compared to single amino acid substitutions of the mostly attenuated cr  and the fully attenuated b <dig>  strains. the large differential in snp accumulation between passaged strains of csf 259– <dig> and thc 02– <dig> are consistent with differential mutation process and coincidently may reflect differences at the lineage level  <cit> .

unfortunately, there are no molecular tools allowing for universal allelic exchange of genes in f. psychrophilum  <cit> . therefore, there is no direct way of assessing rpob involvement in the process of rifampicin-induced attenuation. introduction of the mutant rpob allele from the b <dig>  cr and tr into the wild-type f. psychrophilum would be the most direct method to investigate the role of rifampicin-resistant rna polymerase in attenuation of these bacterial strains. other options to characterize of attenuation in the cn, cr and b <dig> strains would be comparison of transcriptomes or more in-depth analysis of dna methylation patterns between these and the virulent csf 259– <dig> strain to examine possible global transcriptional changes from rpob mutations or altered dna methylation that might contribute to differential transcriptional regulation.

differential dna methylation may be associated with loss of virulence as altered dna methylation affects these traits in other bacterial species  <cit> . others have found evidence for different methylation patterns among f. psychrophilum strains using restriction enzyme analysis  <cit> . consequently, it was not entirely unexpected to find differences in methylation motifs based on the pacbio analysis . it is remarkable, however, that there were no shared motifs between these two strains. unfortunately, this also means that the comparison of the cr and tr strains provides no insight into the potential contribution of methylation to attenuation. nevertheless, given that methylation and restriction enzymes can function to defend bacteria from foreign dna, it is tempting to speculate that the two lineages of f. psychrophilum have diverged due to the influence of different phage communities. csf 259– <dig> is most closely associated with freshwater fisheries whereas the thc 02– <dig> lineage is most closely associated with anadromous fish. it is likely that phage communities differ substantially between these ecosystems.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that the two f. psychrophilum strains passaged with rifampicin harbored from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  %  more snps than the paired strains that were passaged without the antibiotic. importantly, passaged thc 02– <dig> strains, regardless of rifampicin presence in media, revealed considerably more snps  than the csf 259– <dig> strains, and that difference is correlated with the fact that these two strains belong to two genetically divergent lineages  <cit> . we also present data consistent with distinctly different methylation motifs between these two lineages. we observed almost complete attenuation of csf 259– <dig> passaged with rifampicin  and significant loss of virulence of the csf 259– <dig> strain passaged without antibiotic . these reductions of virulence of the cn  and cr  strains occurred despite a limited number of snps,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, as compared to  <dig> snps of the fully attenuated b <dig> strain. the b <dig> strain shares no snps with the cn or cr strains, although both b <dig> and cr share a loss of gliding motility. there are several additional snp’s that could collectively contribute to reduced virulence.
