BACKGROUND
the oxygen carrying function of the red blood cell  leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species in the cell, and despite an intricate system of antioxidants, free radical damage of un-saturated acyl chains of glycerophospholipids occurs continuously. these oxidized acyl chains lead to a breach in normal membrane lipid organization and need to be replaced to maintain integrity of the membrane. the oxidized phospholipids  are de-acylated by phospholipase a <dig>  action  <cit> , and re-acylation of the resulting lysophospholipid  is achieved by a two-step process. fatty acids are activated to acyl-coas by membrane-bound long-chain acyl-coa synthetases   <cit>  and the acyl group of acyl-coa is then transferred to lysopl by acyl-coa:lysopl acyltransferase  enzymes  <cit> . this repair mechanism is also known as the lands’ cycle  <cit> .

phosphatidylcholine  is the most abundant glycerophospholipid in membranes  <cit> , with unsaturated acyl chains, mainly found at the sn- <dig> position. repair of oxidized pc and re-acylation of the lysopc in rbc proceeds rapidly by utilizing fatty acids that are taken up from plasma, and the action of acsl and lpcat in the plasma membrane  <cit> . we previously identified acsl <dig> as the acyl-coa synthetase in the rbc membrane and lpcat <dig> as the acyl-coa:lysopc acyltransferase  <cit> . lpcat <dig> is also the enzyme for the re-acylation of pc in alveolar type ii cells  <cit> . furthermore, lpcat <dig> might play an essential role in production of lipid surfactant in lung  <cit> , and in regulating the level of inflammatory lipids, such as lysopaf and lysopc, in the retina  <cit> . lpcat <dig> also appears to mediate o-palmitoylation of histone h <dig> in the nuclei of lung epithelial cell  <cit> .

lpcat <dig> does not require ca2+ for activity  <cit>  and was reported as a ca2+-independent member of the lpcat family of enzymes  <cit> . activity of lpcat <dig> is regulated by ca2+ <cit>  and was defined as a ca2+-dependent member of the lpcat family  <cit> . however, two ef-hand motifs, folding into hairpin structure coordinating ca2+ <cit> , are predicted in both lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig>  <cit> . although, we have confirmed that ca2+was not required for activity of lpcat <dig>  i.e. ca2+-independent in  <cit> , we have established that ca2+was in fact inhibitory on the lpcat <dig> activity  <cit> . at the millimolar ca2+ concentration values found in plasma  <cit> , acylation rate of lpc by lpcat <dig> was reduced and showed dependency to ca2+ concentration  <cit> . thus, as it is the case for lpcat <dig>  ca2+ also regulates the activity of lpcat <dig>  these observations led us to investigate the role of the predicted ef-hand motifs in ca2+-binding.

lpcat <dig> activity is also sensitive to treatment by sulfhydryl-modifier agents, such as the alkylating thiol reductant n-ethyl maleimide   <cit> . cursory observation indicated that of the  <dig> cysteines of lpcat <dig>  cys- <dig> found at the + <dig> position of motif iii, 207pegt <dig>  could be conserved among acyltransferase forms that are sensitive to nem and may be responsible for their sensitivity to this agent  <cit> . this residue was also proposed to define the ‘motif 3-cysteine acytransferases’ sub-family of lplat enzyme and to be crucial for catalysis  <cit> . however, the role of cys- <dig> in the sensitivity to nem and in catalysis was never tested since even the substitution of cys- <dig> to the arginine residue present at the end of motif iii of lpaat enzymes  <cit> , rendered an inactive c211r form  <cit> . similarly, substitution of arg- <dig> of motif iii of the human lpaat enzyme agpat <dig> to several other residues rendered inactive forms  <cit> .

we report that the efh- <dig> motif of lpcat <dig> is a functional ca2+-binding site and that cys- <dig> is not essential for activity of lpcat <dig>  up to six cysteines residues, including cys- <dig>  are responsible for the decrease activity of the enzyme after treatment by nem and diamide. the sensitivity of lpcat <dig> activity to thiol damage and to ca2+ binding to the efh- <dig> site establishes that acylation of the most abundant phospholipids of the cell membranes is under the control of the redox status and ca2+ concentration of the cell.

RESULTS
role of asp- <dig> and glu- <dig> residues in calcium inhibition
we previously determined that activity of mouse lpcat <dig>  and of lpcat <dig>  were inhibited in presence of millimolar concentration of calcium chloride. addition of edta to the reaction mixture restored activity  <cit> . as observed in some membranes  <cit> , physiological intracellular ca2+ concentration  had no effect on activity. the activity of third member aytl <dig>  currently annotated as lpcat <dig>  was not affected by the presence of ca2+. a pair of ca2+-binding sites of the ef-hand type was predicted at the carboxy-terminal extremity of lpcat <dig> and lpcat <dig> but not of lpcat <dig> . of the two motifs, efh- <dig> was the best match to a consensus sequence , as it contains the crucial first aspartate and last glutamate residues, which are necessary to coordinate the divalent cation to the hairpin structure  <cit> .

asp- <dig> and glu- <dig> were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis to alanine. the two single-substituted recombinant protein, d392a and e403a, and the double mutant form, d392a/e403a, were produced and their activities in absence and presence of an inhibitory ca2+ concentration of 10 mm  <cit>  were determined. all three mutants proteins were active and their activity rate was  <dig> to 80% of lpcat <dig> activity . thus, asp- <dig> and glu- <dig>  which are not conserved in lplat enzymes, are dispensable for activity. activity of the mutant forms was less sensitive to presence of ca2+ than lpcat <dig>  in particular, activity of the double mutant form d392a/e403a was unaffected even in presence of 10 mm calcium chloride , which resulted in a 4-fold inhibition of activity of lpcat <dig> . these findings establish that efh- <dig> motif is a functional ca2+-binding site. it was reported that lpcat <dig> does not require ca2+ <cit> , these data show that the activity of lpcat <dig> is regulated by high ca2+-concentrations.

sensitivity of lpcat <dig> to thiol alkylation and oxidation
lpcat <dig> has  <dig> cysteine residues and the activity of human lpcat <dig> was shown to be inhibited by the thiol alkylating agent n-ethylmaleimide   <cit> . sensitivity of the lpcat <dig> acyltransferase activity to oxidation of thiol groups of cysteines was determined after incubation with either nem or the cross-linker agent diamide at a concentration of  <dig>  mm for  <dig> minutes. subsequently the mixtures were diluted 20-fold and activity was measured. under these conditions, lpcat <dig> activity was reduced to 20-25% as compared to the activity after incubation with buffer . in addition, protein was also labeled by a biotinylated-version of nem, 3-maleimidylpropionyl-biocytin , which confirmed the sensitivity of some sulfhydryl groups to the alkylating agent . treatment of lpcat <dig> with 20 mm dtt had little effect on activity suggesting that in the membrane, cysteines important for activity were in a reduced state . diamide generates disulfide bonds between cysteines whereas nem alkylates -sh group of cysteines. as anticipated, incubation with dtt fully restored activity of a diamide-treated enzyme mixture but the covalent modification of these cysteines by nem could not be reversed by dtt treatment .

cys- <dig> is not essential for activity
in order to determine the role of cys- <dig>  in catalysis and in sensitivity of the enzyme to nem treatment, we performed a saturated random mutagenesis of the cys-211codon and screened the collection of clones for active mutant forms . as observed previously  <cit> , we confirmed that substitution of cys- <dig> to most other residues greatly reduced activity of lpcat <dig>  resulting in enzymes with low or no detectable activity . however, one mutant form, c211t, could produce as much pc as lpcat <dig> , with an activity rate of about 60% of lpcat <dig> . thus, cys- <dig> is not essential for catalysis.

cys- <dig> is accessible to sulfhydryl-modifier reagents
the rate of lpcat <dig> activity is dependent on the concentration of nem and was reduced almost ten-fold after treatment with 1 mm . although, the c211t protein was not as sensitive as lpcat <dig> to nem, it was still inhibited by this sulfhydryl reagent . at a nem concentration of  <dig>  mm, the c211t enzyme was inhibited nearly as much as lpcat <dig> . however, whereas treatment with higher nem concentration  decreased the activity rate of lpcat <dig> another 3-fold, it had no additional inhibitory effect on the c211t form. similarly, this mutant form was also less sensitive to inhibition by diamide  as compared to lpcat <dig>  thus, removal of cys- <dig> had a protective effect towards the treatment by sulfhydryl-oxidizer and alkylating agents, but the biphasic pattern of the nem titration of c211t activity also indicated that other cysteines altered catalysis after attack by the alkylating agent . in support of these findings, we found that the c211t protein was still labeled by the biotinylated alkylating agent maleimidylpropionyl-biocytin  .

role of cysteine residues in sensitivity to sulfhydryl modifier agents
to identify other cysteine residues conferring sensitivity to nem and diamide, we performed alanine scanning of the  <dig> cysteines still present in the active mutant form c211t. the mutants were generated by a multi-sites-directed mutagenesis approach to create a collection of different proteins with an increased probability to find active forms among them . the collection is listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  protein expression, acyltransferase activity and sensitivity to sulfhydryl modifier agents of the mutant forms are shown in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

the majority of the mutants displayed a very low activity . however in addition to the c211t form described above, five mutants missing  <dig> to  <dig> cysteines were obtained that showed acyltransferase activity . these  <dig> active proteins establish that cys- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are not essential to the acyltransferase reaction . we could not identify a pattern and determine which cysteine, if any, was essential for activity. as observed for many of the substitutions tested with the cys- <dig> residue and resulting in inactive mutant forms, alanine substitution of other non-essential cysteines could render mutant proteins with low activity due to structural alterations and defects. among the active mutants, the form lacking all six cysteines mentioned above, c211t ca, was the most active and had a higher activity rate than lpcat <dig> . the other active forms displayed  <dig> to 150% of the activity of lpcat <dig> . with one exception, all active forms were as sensitive to nem and diamide treatment as was c211t . activity of the mutant c211t ca was not affected by treatment with either reagent . even under condition resulting in  <dig> to 90% inhibition of the activity of lpcat <dig>  this mutant protein was still fully active. moreover, it reproducibly displayed greater activity after treatment by diamide .

cysteines labeling by maleimidylpropionyl-biocytin reagent
lpcat <dig>  c211t and a mutant form lacking all  <dig> cysteines  were purified  and then, exposed to maleimidylpropionyl-biocytin, which can be detected with streptavidin . the cys12- protein was not modified by mpb indicating the cysteine-requirement of this alkylating reagent . however, both lpcat <dig> and the c211t protein were labeled by mbp . these results confirmed the sensitivity of more than one -sh group to nem and thus, that several cysteine residues, not only cys- <dig>  are the target of these alkylating agents.

to define the role of the  <dig> cysteines in the alkylation reaction, mutant forms embedded in the membrane, and presumably correctly folded, were exposed to mpb. following treatment and quenching with excess amount of dtt, membrane proteins were dissolved in chaps and mutant forms were purified, as described in the experimental section. the label was revealed with streptavidin and the different forms  were detected with an antibody reacting against the hexa-histidine tag. unexpectedly, all  <dig> cysteines were alkylated and all mutant forms containing at least one cysteine residue were labeled by mbp . even the mutant enzyme c211t ca, whose activity was not affected by treatment with nem, was also labeled by mpb . this result established that alkylation of some of the  <dig> cysteines still present in c211t ca were susceptible to alkylation and that their alteration had no effect on activity of the enzyme . it cannot be ruled out that substitution of one, or more, cysteine resulted in a structural change and the exposure of thiol groups that were otherwise protected from labeling in the native form. however, the findings obtained with the c211t ca enzyme established that modification of lpcat <dig> by alkylating agents is due to attack of several cysteine residues that are not essential for catalysis.

discussion
in the calmodulin superfamily of ca2+-binding proteins, repeats of ef-hand motifs are often present in tandem but few forms, such as the members of the s <dig> family, contain a single pair of sites  <cit> . member  <dig> and  <dig> of the lpcat family have two ef-hand motifs and thus, belong to the s <dig> ca2+-binding protein family  <cit> . in the helix-loop-helix structure of such calcium-binding sites, the loop coordinates the divalent cation to seven oxygen atoms of semi-conserved residues  <cit> . there is a great variability of sequence but the first and last residues of the loop are almost always an aspartate and glutamate, respectively. the efh- <dig> motif of lpcat <dig> is lacking these two important residues  <cit> . it was suggested that the ef-hand motifs of lpcat <dig> could be structurally different with divergent functions as compared to those present in lpcat <dig>  <cit> . our findings establish that activity of lpcat <dig> is controlled by ca2+ and that the efh-hand motifs of lpcat <dig> represent active ca2+-binding sites, as in lpcat <dig> 

the residue found at the + <dig> position of motif iii of lplat was thought to confer preference to different acceptor species  for acylation with acyl-coas. with the identification of many more members of the large lplat family, it now appears that presence of a cysteine, arginine or aspartate residue at that position does not define specificity to the substrate . nevertheless, these residues must play some role in catalysis since their substitution often rendered inactive forms. as shown previously by shimizu, t and colleagues  <cit> , we confirmed that cys- <dig> of lpcat <dig> could not be replaced by an arginine residue. an arginine is present at that position in the three characterized lpaat enzymes  . substitution of cys- <dig> to many other residues rendered inactive forms. substitution of arg- <dig> of agpat <dig> to an alanine or a lysine also rendered inactive enzymes  <cit> . thus, these residues are important for activity of lplat enzymes but activity of the c211t mutant of lpcat <dig> established that contrary to previous report  <cit> , cys- <dig> is not essential for catalysis. in addition, removal of cys- <dig> did reduce, but did not eliminate sensitivity to nem. it also did not prevent labeling of the protein by mpb. these results demonstrate that cys- <dig> is also not crucial for the sensitivity of lpcat <dig> activity to alkylating agents. the c211t ca enzyme was unaffected by treatment with diamide and nem suggesting that a combination of several cysteines among cys- <dig>  cys- <dig>  cys- <dig>  cys- <dig>  cys- <dig> and cys- <dig> confer sensitivity of the acyltransferase reaction to these reagent but that none of these residues is essential for catalysis.

CONCLUSIONS
the rbc is exposed to high oxidant stress from the cytosolic side due to the hemoglobin-mediated transport of oxygen and is exposed to high concentrations of ca2+ in plasma  <cit> . both an increase in cytosolic calcium and oxidant stress lead to a loss of the membrane phospholipid asymmetry with the exposure of phosphatidylserine and removal of the damaged cells. the sensitivity of the de-acylation/re-acylation repair cycle suggests that the integrity of their membrane will also be compromised. in hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, the presence of damaged rbcs in the circulation plays a significant aggravating role in the vasculopathy that characterizes these disorders. thus, regulation of lpcat <dig> activity might contribute to the removal of damaged-rbcs from the circulation and could represent a mechanism for the dismissal of stressed cells in other tissues.
