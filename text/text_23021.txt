BACKGROUND
in general, inflammation plays a role in most bladder pathologies, including bladder cancer  <cit>  and represents a defensive reaction to injury caused by physical damage, chemical substances, micro-organisms, or other agents  <cit> . in particular, bladder neurogenic inflammation involves the participation of mast cells and sensory nerves. evidence for a role of mast cells in cystitis was reviewed recently  <cit>  and includes the presence of mast cells containing tryptase in the bladder  <cit>  and urine of ic patients  <cit> , and that mast cell counts in ic patients are one of the few features significantly associated with night-time frequency of urination  <cit> . we have previously presented direct evidence indicating a key role for mast cells and their products in bladder inflammation  <cit> , and others emphasized the role of mast cell products in bladder disorders  <cit> .

as a consequence of inflammation, products of mast cell degranulation, such as tryptase, can be found in the urine of cystitis patients  <cit> . in addition to tryptase, other serine proteases such as thrombin and trypsin are produced during tissue damage and make important contributions to tissue responses to injury, repair, cell survival, inflammation  <cit> , and pain  <cit> . tissue responses to these enzymes are modulated by protease-activated receptors , a unique class of g protein-coupled receptors that use a fascinating mechanism to convert an extracellular proteolytic cleavage event into a trans-membrane signal. these receptors carry their own ligands, which remain cryptic until unmasked by receptor cleavage .

four pars have been cloned so far, and all four pars are co-expressed in the mouse bladder urothelium  <cit> , with par <dig> and par <dig> being the most abundant in the bladder epithelial layer. although information regarding the presence of pars in human urothelial cells is scanty, indirect evidence indicates that human cancer urothelial cells, such as j <dig>  augment the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, a key activator of pars  <cit> . in addition, thrombin and other elements of the coagulation cascade activate j <dig> carcinoma cells, inducing ca2+ mobilization, phospholipase c activity, and cell migration  <cit> . another human bladder cell line, rt <dig>  responds to thrombin, tryptase or par-aps with an increase in intracellular phospholipase a <dig> activity, arachidonic acid and prostaglandin e <dig> release  <cit> . in this work, we determined whether all four receptors are present in the human urothelial j <dig> cell line.

in addition to the urothelium, par <dig> and par <dig> are also expressed in mouse detrusor muscle, and par <dig> is expressed in mouse peripheral nerves and plexus cell bodies  <cit> . similarly, in rats par <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed in urothelium, detrusor muscle, and bladder nerve fibers, and bladder afferent cells in dorsal root ganglia express par <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . confocal microscopy has revealed the co-localization of par <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with protein gene products  <dig>  and vanilloid receptor  <dig>  suggesting that pars are distributed in c-fiber bladder nerves  <cit> . in addition, pars are differentially modulated during mouse bladder inflammation. urothelial par <dig> and, to a lesser extent, par <dig> are down-regulated in acute inflammation whereas par <dig> and par <dig> are up-regulated  <cit> . bladder fibroblasts were found to present a clear demarcation in par expression in response to acute and chronic inflammation  <cit> . additional evidence for the participation of pars in the bladder inflammatory response was the finding that known pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lps, substance p, and antigen challenge induce an increase in par <dig> rna within four hours  <cit> . upregulation of par protein levels have been shown to be part of rat bladder responses to cyclophosphamide  <cit> .

in order to better understand the role of pars in cystitis, we used a well-established mouse model  <cit>  to determine the relative potency of par-activating peptides . par3-ap was not included in this research because of a lack of specificity of the available reagent. comparison of inflammatory responses in wild type, par1- and par2-deficient mice, revealed a mandatory role of par <dig> and, to a lesser extent, par <dig> in mediating bladder responses to a variety of pro-inflammatory stimuli.

the combination of morphological results reveals an overriding participation of par <dig> receptors in bladder inflammation and provides a working model to investigate the inflammatory cascade downstream of par activation.

RESULTS
human urothelial cell line expresses all four pars
in order to extend our previous results obtained with the mouse bladder  <cit> , we also tested the presence of pa receptors in the j <dig> human urothelial cancer cell line. our results indicate all four pars are detectable at the protein level by immunohistochemistry  and at the message level by polymerase chain reaction  in human urothelial cancer cell line.

par-aps induce bladder inflammation
next, we determined whether activation of pars in mice would induce bladder inflammation. figure  <dig> shows a representative photomicrograph demonstrating that an inflammatory response was mounted twenty-four hours after bladder instillation with par4-ap . inflammation secondary to par4-ap was characterized by vasodilation , sub-epithelial infiltration of inflammatory cells , and edema . a high magnification photomicrograph  indicates that the majority of inflammatory cells responding to par4-ap were polymorphonuclear  leukocytes characteristic of acute bladder inflammation  <cit> . in addition, the cellular infiltrate expanded from submucosal layers towards the detrusor smooth muscle  and within the detrusor nerve elements, previously shown to contain par <dig> , are surrounded by inflammatory cells. similar results were obtained  <dig> hours after bladder instillation with par4-ap with the addition of macrophages to the lesion .

next, we compared the effect of  <dig> μm concentrations of par1-ap, par2-ap, and par-4-ap on the degree of pmn infiltration into the urinary bladder. the representative photomicrographs on figure  <dig> indicate that contrast to the control peptide which failed to induce bladder inflammation , par1- , par2- , and par4-ap  induced different densities of inflammatory cell infiltrate. figure  <dig> summarizes the results obtained with different concentrations of par-aps. an inflammatory cell infiltrate was detected at concentrations as low as  <dig>  μm and reached a peak at  <dig> μm par4-ap. these results indicate that, at least in the mouse bladder, the instillation of  <dig> μm par4-ap or  <dig> μm par1-ap induces a strong inflammatory reaction characterized by the highest number of pmns infiltrating the bladder. both par1-ap and par2-ap at  <dig> μm concentration induced bladder inflammation but the number of pmns that infiltrated the urinary bladder was smaller than that observed with par4- ap . no inflammation was observed in mice instilled with pyrogen-free saline or  <dig> μm control peptide dissolved in pbs.

par1-/- and par2-/- mice were used to determine whether those receptors were downstream of a common inflammatory cascade. we chose the following classical inflammatory stimuli: substance p, lps, and antigen-challenge  because they were shown to depend on mast cells for eliciting bladder inflammation  <cit> , and products of mast cell degranulation such as chymase and tryptase activate par <dig>  <cit>  and par <dig> receptors  <cit> , respectively. for this purpose, groups of anesthetized female, wild type , par1-/-, and par2-/- mice  were instilled with saline, or with control inactive peptide , or one of the following substances at concentrations known to induce inflammatory response  <cit> : substance p , escherichia coli lps strain 055:b <dig> , dnp4-ova , par1-ap , and par2-ap . twenty-four hours later, bladders were removed for quantification of pmn infiltration. figures 7a and 7b summarize the results obtained. par1-/- mice presented a reduced response to substance p, lps, and antigen stimulation . however, the responses to par2-ap obtained in par1-/- mice were not altered . the major difference between par1-/- and par2-/- mice is that the latter still presented an inflammatory response to antigen .

regarding other inflammatory cells, bladders isolated from par1-/- and par2-/- presented equivalent number of mast cells when compared to wild type mice . after stimulation with the pro-inflammatory stimuli, the bladder of wild type mice presented signs of mast cell activation by the presence of degranulation. in contrast, except for some perivascular infiltrate, few inflammatory cells were seen in the bladder of par1-/- mice in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli . in addition, when mast cells were visible, there was no apparent sign of degranulation, which may reflect poor activation of those cells .

these results indicate that par <dig> receptors are essential for bladder inflammation secondary to several pro-inflammatory stimuli, while par- <dig> receptors seem to have a decreased role, at least in mediating the responses to antigen challenge. because the transgenic mouse models used have been reported to be complete knockouts  <cit>  and par2-ap has no effect on par <dig> knockout mice  <cit> , we did not test par1-ap in par1-/-and par2-ap in par <dig> -/- mice.

discussion
role of par in bladder inflammation
proteases that are released during inflammation and injury cleave pars on the urothelium, detrusor muscle, and nerve elements to cause neurogenic bladder inflammation  <cit>  and hyperalgesia  <cit> . as we demonstrated earlier by ihc, pars are over-expressed in the bladder following cystitis induced by classical mediators such as lps and sp  <cit> .

this study determined whether all four par receptors are expressed in human urothelial cell line. the presence of multiple pars on the same cell is thought to extend the range of proteases a cell responds to rather than expand the range of intracellular responses  <cit> . human transitional-cell carcinoma  cells express various g protein-coupled receptors, and the presence of pars in this cell line was based on the effects of thrombin, which induces a strong migration of j <dig> cells by a mechanism that involves ca2+ mobilization and activation of rho kinase leading to a reorganization of the cytoskeleton  <cit> . in addition to the j <dig> cell line, expression of pars in rt <dig> bladder papilloma cells was inferred based on findings that rt <dig> cells respond to activators of pars such as thrombin, tryptase, and par-activating peptides <cit> . those par activators induced a calcium independent phospholipase a <dig> with the consequent release of arachidonic acid and synthesis of prostaglandin e <dig>  <cit> . since the presence of pars in human urothelium was only based on circumstantial evidence, we determined whether j <dig> carcinoma cell line expresses par protein and rna. our results demonstrate that the j <dig> human urothelial cell line expresses all four pa receptors.

an additional goal of this paper was to determine whether pa receptors are part of the inflammatory cascade mediating the response of the urinary bladder to known pro-inflammatory stimuli. the stimuli were chosen because we have published evidence that each one of them when instilled into the mouse bladder produces inflammation: substance p  <cit> , lps  <cit> , and antigen challenge of sensitized mice  <cit> . however, the present manuscript did not determine which endogenous substance is responsible for activation of par receptors, and therefore, the following discussion is based on the literature and not in the results of this manuscript. the information regarding endogenous activators of pars in the mouse bladder is, unfortunately, scanty. while human connective tissue mast cells contain the enzymes chymase and tryptase, mice contain numerous related proteases  <cit> . mouse mast cell protease- <dig> is a tryptase predominantly expressed in differentiated connective tissue-type mast cells  <cit> . mast cell proteases mcpt <dig> , mcpt <dig> and  <dig>  are expressed during the development of the mouse embryo  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information regarding which particular tryptase is expressed in the mouse bladder and/or upregulated in this mouse model during inflammation. although thrombin is a recognized physiological activator of par <dig> and par <dig>  the endogenous enzymes responsible for activating par <dig> in urinary bladder are not known. recently, it was demonstrated that the tissue kallikrein family of proteinases are able to regulate par signaling and may represent important endogenous regulators par <dig>  par <dig>  and par <dig>  <cit> . the latter are likely to be confirmed in the urinary tract, since members of the kallikrein family play a fundamental role in bladder physiology  <cit> .

administration of par peptide agonists into the urinary bladder of mice elicited an inflammatory reaction characterized by edema and granulocyte infiltration. interestingly, the inflammatory responses to par4-ap peaked at  <dig> μm and higher concentrations of this peptide  failed to produce an additional increase in pmns migration, but rather induced a lesser degree of inflammation. several possibilities could explain this finding, including par desensitization and endocytosis  <cit> , shedding of these receptors from the cells, as is the case of par <dig> in endothelial cells exposed to thrombin  <cit> , and shedding of urothelial cells bearing these receptor, as we suggested  <cit> . although we observed a potent inflammatory response secondary to par4-ap, par4-/- mice were not available in our laboratory at the time this project started. nevertheless, our results emphasize the importance of this receptor in cystitis.

in the present work, we determined that par1-/- and, to a lesser extent, par2-/- mice present decreased inflammatory responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli. the results obtained with par-deficient mice provide evidence indicating that substances known to stimulate mast cells, such as sp and antigen, induce a bladder inflammatory reaction that depends on par activation. in addition, these results indicate that toxins such as lps, known to be released during bladder infection, also share the same par pathway.

the authors acknowledge the lack of functional data on in vivo urinary bladder function at this time. in vitro experiments indicate that both trypsin and par- <dig> activating peptide ) produced a concentration-dependent contractile response in the rat urinary bladder preparations. these contractions were abolished by removal of the urinary bladder mucosa and were significantly reduced by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin  <cit> . the release of prostaglandins by par- <dig> activators seems to be partly mediated by the phospholipase a <dig>   <cit> . these responses were enhanced in bladders isolated from cyclophosphamide-treated rats  <cit> . the in vitro work confirms the evidence that par activation leads to ipla2-mediated prostaglandin release in human urothelial carcinoma cell line rt <dig>  <cit> , human bladder microvascular endothelial  <cit> , and normal urothelial cells  <cit> . however, there is no in vivo functional data on the effect of par stimulation on bladder urodynamic behavior.

it is not clear why the experimental cystitis in par2-/- mice was not totally abolished, as seen in par1-/-. both par <dig> -/- and par <dig> -/- mice have been well characterized  <cit> ; see  <cit>  for reviews. in addition, par2-ap has no effect on par <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms from other pa receptors could be possible. regarding the difference of response between par <dig> -/- and par <dig> -/- mice, this may reflect a different role of the endogenous ligand since par <dig> is activated by thrombin, while par <dig> is activated by mast cell tryptase  <cit> . it has to be taken into consideration that some of the par agonists, such as thrombin, activate more than one receptor. indeed, in addition to par <dig>  thrombin activates par <dig>  <cit>  and type-ii tgfβ receptors and consequently leads to their down regulation  <cit> . par <dig>  <cit>  and possibly par <dig> and par <dig> are involved in vascular inflammation, but the primary role for par <dig> seems to be cytoprotection in the gastro intestinal tract  <cit>  and airways  <cit> . it was reported that whereas par1-/- mice do not mount inflammatory responses to a variety of stimuli, par2-/- mice present a delayed microvascular inflammation  <cit>  and a reduced encephalomyelitis  <cit> .

another possible explanation for the discrepancy between par <dig> and par <dig> is the differential localization of the two pars in urinary bladder. par <dig> is much more abundant than par <dig> in the urothelium. however, following acute and chronic inflammation, probably because of the shedding of urothelial cells bearing pars, both par <dig> and par <dig> expression are reduced  <cit> . alternatively, the association between par <dig> and par <dig> with vallinoid receptors  <cit>  in sensory c fibers deserves further investigation as a possible explanation for a differential participation of par <dig> and par <dig> in inflammation. another hypothesis points to the control of par by a metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of proteins from the cell surface  <cit> . more recently, it has been shown in humans that the downstream signal transduction cascade in response to par <dig> but not par <dig> depends on an interacting partner, the jun activation domain-binding protein  <dig>   <cit> . taken together, data from literature suggests a differential fate for par <dig> receptor as compared to par <dig> receptor, which could help to explain the difference in response to inflammatory stimuli in the bladder of par1-/- versus par2-/- mice. regardless of the receptor type, our findings demonstrate an overwhelming participation of pars in bladder inflammation and place them in a central role controlling the communication between the immune system represented by mast cells, the sensory system represented by sp, and infection represented by lps.

CONCLUSIONS
this work indicates an overriding participation of par <dig> receptors in bladder inflammation, provides a working model for the involvement of a network of transcripts downstream of par <dig> activation, and evokes testable hypotheses regarding the regulation of par. it remains to be determined whether par <dig> receptor blockade or selective gene silencing of transcripts downstream of par activation will ameliorate the clinical manifestation of cystitis. inhibiting of par up-regulation using small interfering rna technology, as confirmed by immunoblotting, should substantially reduced bladder inflammatory response as it has been shown in other systems  <cit> .
