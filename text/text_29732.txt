BACKGROUND
carbohydrates, in the form of mono-, di-, oligo-, and polysaccharides, as well as glycoconjugates, play fundamental roles in all forms of life
 <cit> . beyond their role in energy storage, carbohydrates are central to diverse biological processes such as host-pathogen interactions, signal transduction, inflammation, intracellular trafficking, diseases, and differentiation/development. not least, as structural components of terrestrial biomass, carbohydrates comprise approximately 75% of the carbon fixed annually by primary production
 <cit> . sugar-rich plant cell walls, seeds, and tubers thus represent a renewable material with significant potential to address energy and material needs.

a striking feature of carbohydrates is their remarkable structural complexity, due to a rich diversity of monosaccharide building blocks, and the possibility of numerous stereo- and regiospecific linkages
 <cit> , which give rise to both simple linear and complex, highly branched molecules
 <cit> . a decade of investments in genomics and proteomics has greatly improved our interpretation of the molecular language of the cell, but deciphering the complex carbohydrate-based information in the biomolecular landscape is still in its infancy. indeed, glycomics has been identified both as “the last frontier of molecular and cellular biology”
 <cit>  as well as an “emerging technology that will change the world”
 <cit> .

functional analysis of glycans and glycoconjugates is complicated by the fact that they are not direct genetic products, but are instead synthesized, recognized, modified, and degraded by a plethora of carbohydrate-active enzymes  and binding proteins. in the synthetic direction, phosphosugar-dependent glycosyltransferases  catalyze the formation of glycosidic linkages, whereas their breakdown is mediated by glycoside hydrolases  and polysaccharide lyases , with the assistance of carbohydrate esterases . the structural diversity of carbohydrates is reflected in an abundance of cazyme-encoding genes, which comprise 1-3% of the genome of most organisms
 <cit> . expanding and harnessing knowledge of the complexity of the “cazome” is thus essential to understanding the complexity of the glycome.

the protein sequence-based classification of cazymes was initiated in  <dig> as a complement to the long-standing enzyme commission  number system
 <cit> , which is based solely on enzyme activities
 <cit> . given the prevalence of convergent evolution of enzymes that cleave glycosidic bonds, as well as the demonstrable catalytic promiscuity of individual enzymes, sequence-based classification has proven to be a robust way to unify information on enzyme structure, specificity, and mechanism, which provides enormous predictive power
 <cit> . initially motivated by a need to delineate cellulases  into distinct structural families
 <cit> , the first incarnation of the gh family classification, as such, comprised  <dig> gh families
 <cit> . the number of families increased steadily with the growing interest in glycobiology so that, as of august  <dig>   <dig> sequence-based families of ghs have been defined in the continuously updated cazy database
 <cit> .

presently, one of the largest gh families is gh <dig>  historically known as “cellulase family a” as it was the first cellulase family described
 <cit> . gh <dig> exemplifies a family with a large variety of specificities: it currently contains close to  <dig> experimentally determined enzyme activities denoted with an ec number. the abundance of gh <dig> enzymes in different ecological niches has been highlighted by their frequent identification in metagenomes of diverse microbial communities
 <cit> , as well as the genomes of individual organisms
 <cit> . as with other cazyme families
 <cit> , gh <dig> members are commonly found to be encoded as parts of multi-modular polypeptide chains containing other catalytic, substrate-binding, and functionally unidentified or yet to be described modules.

within the large gh <dig> family, a discernible diversity of sequences was observed soon after its creation. the first five subfamilies of gh <dig>  were identified as early as 1990
 <cit> . subfamily a <dig> was introduced in 1997
 <cit>  and the following year eukaryotic and prokaryotic β-mannanases were assigned to a <dig> and a <dig>  respectively
 <cit> . subsequently, subfamily a <dig> was introduced in a study, which notably also suggested the merger of a <dig> and a6
 <cit> . finally, a <dig> was the most recently defined gh <dig> subfamily
 <cit> , while new subfamilies that presently lack a unique identifier have also been suggested
 <cit> . family gh <dig> belongs to clan gh-a, which presently groups  <dig> gh families to form the largest set of evolutionarily related gh families described in cazy thus far .

families such as gh <dig> were originally defined with a very small number of sequences. with the accumulation of an increasing body of sequence data, the relationship between the original families has sometimes changed enough to merit reexamination of family membership. very recently, detailed three-dimensional structural analysis led to the reclassification of several gh <dig> sequences into family gh <dig> based on the organization of secondary structural elements around the conserved  <dig> fold of the catalytic module
 <cit> .

given the continuing expansion in sequence numbers and the partial gh5/gh <dig> reclassification, it is clear that a global re-analysis of the subfamily division of gh <dig> is now needed. the rapid accumulation of genomic data in the past decade revealed a complex and varied sequence space, with the consequence that a substantial portion of gh <dig> family members are currently not assigned to any subfamily. this situation will only become worse as the rate of genomic sequencing continues to increase with phenomenal rapidity. further, this flood of data will cause an increasing reliance on computer-based annotation, which necessarily requires a robust framework to produce meaningful functional predictions. the division of cazyme families into subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis has been applied as a successful approach to meet this challenge: subfamily classification of gh <dig>  gh <dig> and all of the pl families has demonstrated that the majority of the defined subfamilies were monospecific, thus indicating a significantly better correlation of substrate specificity between sequences at the subfamily level than the family level
 <cit> . significantly, the division into subfamilies allows the identification of currently uncharacterized subfamilies that can subsequently be analyzed biochemically and structurally to potentially unveil new activities.

hence, we present here an improved, robust subfamily classification for gh <dig> by employing a large-scale analysis of all publicly available sequences. our intention is that the introduction of this additional hierarchical level across this important gh family will serve to guide enzyme discovery, structure-function analysis, and biocatalyst improvement in post-genomic efforts. not least, many enzyme activities relevant to biomass analysis and conversion are found in gh <dig> , as are enzymes with biomedical applications
 <cit> . significantly, the present analysis unveiled a large number of sparsely or incompletely characterized subfamilies that may still hide a number of unsuspected activities and singular structural features.

RESULTS
our bioinformatics approach allowed the division of close to  <dig> gh <dig> catalytic modules into  <dig> distinct subfamilies, as shown in the global phylogenetic tree ; subfamily information is summarized in table
 <dig>  subfamily naming follows the procedure devised for gh <dig>  where the family number is followed by an arabic numeral that reflects the order of creation
 <cit> : gh5_ <dig> to gh5_ <dig>  this series is essentially continuous, with a few exceptions due to historical reasons: all of the previously described subfamilies  have been re-identified in the current investigation except for a <dig> and a <dig>  which are merged into a single subfamily gh5_ <dig> and a <dig> and a <dig> which are unified in subfamily gh5_ <dig> . to maintain consistency with earlier literature, the re-identified historical subfamilies have retained the original arabic numeral. for example, the subfamily formerly known as a <dig> is hereby designated gh5_ <dig>  the absence of subfamilies gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig> reflects the two fusion events involving the historical subfamilies described above

historical names for some subfamilies are provided, along with the taxonomical range, the characterization level and structural information from representative structures. known enzyme activities in family gh <dig> are provided using the following enzyme classification  numbers and corresponding activities:  <dig> . <dig>  – endo-β- <dig> -glucanase or cellulase;  <dig> . <dig>  – endo-β- <dig> -xylanase;  <dig> . <dig>  – β-glucosidase;  <dig> . <dig>  – β-mannosidase;  <dig> . <dig>  – β-glucocerebrosidase;  <dig> . <dig>  – glucan β- <dig> -glucosidase;  <dig> . <dig>  – licheninase;  <dig> . <dig>  – cellodextrinase;  <dig> . <dig>  – glucan endo-β- <dig> -glucosidase;  <dig> . <dig>  – mannan endo-β- <dig> -mannosidase or endo-β- <dig> -mannanase;  <dig> . <dig>  – cellulose β- <dig> -cellobiosidase or cellobiohydrolase;  <dig> . <dig>  – endoglycoceramidase;  <dig> . <dig>  – chitosanase;  <dig> . <dig>  – β-primeverosidase;  <dig> . <dig>  – xyloglucan-specific endo-β- <dig> -glucanase;  <dig> . <dig>  – endo-β- <dig> -galactanase;  <dig> . <dig>  – hesperidin 6-o-α-l-rhamnosyl-β-glucosidase;  <dig> . <dig> - – undefined ec numbers for β- <dig> -mannanase/β- <dig> -glucomannanase or for arabinoxylan-specific β-xylanase or still unclear ec numbers depending on the subfamily ;  <dig> . <dig> - – β-mannan transglycosidase.

in addition to the new and historical designations, the taxonomical range of the included sequences, experimentally determined enzyme activities and representative 3-d structures are presented in table
 <dig> for each subfamily. notably, all of the  <dig> enzymes with a solved 3-d structure have been assigned to a subfamily, resulting in thirteen individual subfamilies out of  <dig> with at least one structural representative. genes that encode gh <dig> enzymes are present in most organisms ranging from archaea and eubacteria to eukaryotes, e.g. fungi and plants. from an anthropocentric perspective, a gh <dig> member is notably lacking in the human genome. examples of metazoan gh <dig> genes are also notably scarce and are limited to nematodes, mollusks, and arthropods, likely resulting from horizontal transfer. for example, several independent horizontal events of transfer of cellulase and xylanase genes from bacteria to nematodes have been described
 <cit>  and the transfer of a bacterial β-mannanase to an insect was recently documented
 <cit> . the taxonomical range at the subfamily level is, naturally, more restricted. a few smaller subfamilies are currently specific to certain types of organisms . for example, eight subfamilies  contain only fungal sequences. subfamily gh5_ <dig> contains only plant members, whereas members of gh5_ <dig> come exclusively from stramenopiles. these limited taxonomic distributions may represent biological  specialization, if not biased by a still incomplete genome sequencing of organisms.

the definition of subfamilies was restricted to phylogenetic clades with five or more members from different organisms available in the public protein databases  in order to capture sufficient diversity for a robust subfamily definition. using these criteria, the overall success rate of subfamily grouping was of approximately 80%, i.e., about 20% of the analyzed gh <dig> sequences could not be classified into subfamilies having at least five public members. the sequences that have not yet been assigned to subfamilies will likely define new subfamilies as the pool of available sequences continues to increase. in the future, these subfamilies will be gradually released with new identifiers when they have been sufficiently populated. compared to the gh <dig> subfamily classification
 <cit> , the gh <dig> subdivision has resulted in both a higher number of subfamilies and a higher number of uncharacterized subfamilies, suggesting that family gh <dig> is comparatively less well explored.

 to further refine the global subfamily analysis, maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis has been performed on each subfamily . in addition to database accession numbers, information about substrate specificity  has been included, and 3-d structures highlighted in each subfamily tree. the  <dig> subfamilies  have been categorized based on available enzyme activity data, to aid their individual descriptions, below. thus, the first group, comprised of “enzymatically-active subfamilies”, contains subfamilies with at least one member whose enzyme activity has been shown. the extent of the documented characterization varies substantially within the group, from simple information obtained from enzymatic assays insufficient to assign a particular ec number , to detailed enzyme specificity and kinetics studies. among the better characterized subfamilies, monospecific subfamilies are distinguished by the presence of only one ec number for one or more members, whereas in polyspecific subfamilies, two or more enzymatic activities have been observed in different members. “uncharacterized subfamilies” comprise the second major group; these subfamilies currently lack documented enzymatic activity altogether.

in this context, it is worth noting that the majority of the large, well characterized subfamilies were polyspecific. these highly populated subfamilies were also the first ones to be identified and described, and often, despite observed polyspecificity, one particular activity predominates. for example,  <dig> of  <dig> characterized enzymes in gh5_ <dig> are reported to be endo-glucanases, whereas one protein is a documented as a cellobiohydrolase, and another was described as displaying licheninase activity. it is, however, difficult to draw far-reaching conclusions based on these observations. on one hand, it may be that the acquisition of a new specificity within a subfamily is a rare event; alternatively, the observation of one or few activities in specific subfamilies may simply be a consequence of differences in the range of substrates tested experimentally.

another significant aspect of many gh <dig> family proteins is that their protein sequence may include additional modules with different functions, and in particular cbms
 <cit> . a great variety of modular structures may be found throughout the family and in a number of individual subfamilies. an analysis of all the complexity of modular structures found in the family goes beyond the objectives of this study, and some aspects of this diversity are illustrated in figure
 <dig>  for instance, many members of subfamily gh5_ <dig> are modular and reveal two major trends:  the addition of one or of multiple cbms  is more common and may be associated not only to the nature of the main substrate of the corresponding catalytic domain, particularly in complex substrates; and  the combinations with other catalytic modules to form bifunctional enzymes , are more rare but particular useful to reveal interacting or synergistic enzyme activities of some catalytic modules. numerous modular arrangements can also be found in other large subfamilies like gh5_ <dig>  gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig>  cbms can be located on the n- or c-terminal side of the gh <dig> module . the combination of catalytic domains may target different tissue components. some may, for instance, target cellulose and cellulose associated substrates  but bifunctional enzymes likely targeting hemicellulose may also be found .
1: figure s <dig>  the module types and other protein segments present are: ghx_y – glycoside hydrolase family x subfamily y ; cex – carbohydrate esterase module of family x ; cip <dig> – chitin-binding protein type  <dig> module with putative carbohydrate oxidative cleaving activity, formerly cbm <dig> ; cbmx – carbohydrate binding modules of family x ; fn <dig> – fibronectin type iii modules ; doc – cellulosomal dockerin modules ; expn – expansin modules ; signal peptides ; transmembrane segments ; linkers ; other regions .

subfamilies with identified active enzymes
monospecific subfamilies
a number of subfamilies exhibit a single activity among their characterized enzyme members. multiple individual examples within a subfamily improve the degree of confidence regarding subfamily monospecificity, while subfamilies with only a single characterized representative may be subject to reinterpretation in the future as the breadth of biochemical data increases.

gh5_ <dig> endo-β- <dig> -glucanases 
the largest subfamily that contains only a single ec number is gh5_ <dig>  which is primarily composed of secreted bacterial and fungal enzymes . all investigated enzymes in gh5_ <dig> display endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activity . one crystal structure has been determined for a thermoascus aurantiacus endo-glucanase
 <cit> . in fungi, about half of the gh <dig> proteins harbor a cbm <dig> module at the n- or c-terminus, which is compatible with an active role on cellulose. no modular proteins are found among the bacterial members of the subfamily.

gh5_ <dig>  gh5_ <dig> and gh5_17: endo-β- <dig> -mannanase 
members of the large gh5_ <dig> subfamily are all extracellular mannan endo-β- <dig> -mannosidases  according to available biochemical characterization, and this subfamily was historically described as the bacterial mannanase subfamily a8
 <cit> . structural analysis has highlighted distinctive features of alkaline β-mannanases
 <cit> . the subfamily now contains a single eukaryotic enzyme from the beetle hypothenemus hampai, resulting from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria
 <cit> .

in the closely related but distinct subfamilies gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig>  only extracellular enzymes with endo-β- <dig> -mannanase activity  have equally been reported. metazoan sequences, including sequences originating from mollusks and arthropods, as well as bacterial sequences compose the gh5_ <dig> subfamily, whereas subfamily gh5_ <dig> only harbors bacterial enzymes. currently, none of the bacterial gh5_ <dig> members have a documented enzyme activity, although a fibrobacter succinogenes enzyme is active on azcl-galactomannan
 <cit> . the bacterial enzymes in gh5_ <dig> are all cellulosomal components from the genus clostridium. 

gh5_ <dig> :  exo-β- <dig> -glucosidase 
subfamily gh5_ <dig> comprises exclusively plant enzymes and relies on a single functional characterization at present. recombinant expression of the rice osgh5bg showed that the enzyme had glucan β- <dig> -glucosidase activity 
 <cit> . a unique feature of gh5_ <dig> is the fascin-like module inserted after β-strand  <dig>  fascin is a human actin-binding protein, but the function of the plant fascin-like domain is unknown. members of gh5_ <dig> are well represented throughout the plant kingdom, but most interestingly, a representative is absent in the leading plant model organism arabidopsis thaliana.

gh5_ <dig> :  β- <dig> -glucanases 
subfamily gh5_ <dig> is a small but well characterized subfamily composed of secreted fungal enzymes. the identified β- <dig> -glucanase activity  is important for the mycoparasitic activity and probably cell wall recycling by some fungi. the gh5_ <dig> phylogenetic tree displays two major clades . the largest clade is formed by enzymes issued from fungi from the class of sordariomycetes. eurotiomycetes are found the second subgroup.

gh5_ <dig> :  endo-β- <dig> -galactanase 
gh5_ <dig> is another example of a monospecific subfamily of secreted enzymes where only a single fully sequenced biochemically characterized β- <dig> -galactanase  is currently known
 <cit> , although partial n-terminal sequence of an aspergillus enzyme, closely related to sequences of other members of the subfamily, yields the same activity
 <cit> . several other enzymes with β- <dig> -galactanase activity have been moved from gh <dig> to gh30_5
 <cit> , but subfamily gh5_ <dig> clearly remains within family gh <dig>  the known β- <dig> -galactanase  is involved in larch wood arabinogalactan degradation
 <cit> .

gh5_ <dig> :  endo-β- <dig> -xylanase 
xylanase  activity has been recently established
 <cit>  for a number of xylanolytic bacteroidetes enzymes belonging to this subfamily. these gh5_ <dig> endo-xylanases integrate xylan utilization gene clusters found in prevotella and bacteroides species and are all apparently secreted. significant differences in their mode of action have been observed, despite the inclusion in the same subfamily. different gh5_ <dig> enzymes were shown to release different products from wheat arabinoxylan
 <cit> .

gh5_ <dig> gh5_ <dig>  gh5_ <dig>  gh5_ <dig>  and gh5_ <dig> : single β-glycanase characterizations
in addition to subfamilies gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig> described above, five other subfamilies are distinguished by harboring only a single experimentally characterized enzyme. endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activity  has been determined in subfamilies gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig>  gh5_ <dig> is a small subfamily currently restricted to secreted fungal proteins. a β- <dig> -mannanase activity a has been reported for an enzyme from paecilomyces lilacinus <cit> . in the small subfamily gh5_ <dig>  composed of extracellular modular proteins from bacterial origin, there is a single enzymatically and structurally characterized enzyme from clostridium thermocellum. notably, although this is the first reported enzyme with arabinoxylanase activity b it was designated ctxyl5a in spite of its inability to attack unsubstituted xylans
 <cit> . finally, the small subfamily gh5_ <dig> is a modular extracellular subfamily that contains a single characterized cellodextrinase 
 <cit> .

gh5_ <dig> gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig> : endo-glycosylceramidases 
gh5_ <dig>  gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig> are subfamilies exclusively containing extracellular endo-glycosylceramidases. subfamily gh5_ <dig> is formed of sequences of eukaryotic origin while the small subfamilies gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig> are bacterial. interestingly, the first subfamily is found among the four subfamilies that contain metazoan gh <dig> enzymes. all but one of the enzymes found in gh5_ <dig> are from actinobacteria. the crystal structure of a rhodococcus endo-glycoceramidase revealed an active site channel atypical for gh <dig> enzymes, which explains the unusual substrate for this type of enzymes
 <cit> . all the gh5_ <dig> sequences reported here are from the genus rhodococcus. the characterized bacterial enzymes of gh5_ <dig> hydrolyze ganglio- and lacto-series glycosphingolipids. in contrast, the only gh5_ <dig> enzyme investigated is not capable of hydrolyzing these substrates. instead, this enzyme shows activity against 6-gala series glycosphingolipids and the designation oligogalactosyl-n-acylsphingosine  <dig> ’-β-galacto-hydrolase has been proposed
 <cit> .

gh5_ <dig> : cellodextrinases 
two enzymes in the small intracellular bacterial gh5_ <dig> subfamily exhibited cellodextrinase activity . in addition two enzymes isolated from the cow rumen have been shown to have hydrolytic activity on carboxymethyl cellulose  agar
 <cit> .

polyspecific subfamilies
some gh <dig> subfamilies group together a panel of activities and are described as polyspecific subfamilies. the apparent plasticity of these subfamilies suggests that only few subtle changes could be sufficient to switch from one activity to the other. more likely, many of the enzymes present on the subfamily level are polyspecific to some extent and therefore should have more than a single ec attributed.

gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig> : β- <dig> -glucan cleaving enzymes
extracellular enzymes from archaea, bacteria and uncultured symbiotic protists are represented in subfamily gh5_ <dig> . the activity observed for most characterized gh5_ <dig> enzymes is endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activity . the apparent exception in subfamily gh5_ <dig> is an exo-acting cellobiohydrolase activity  from clostridium thermocellum <cit> . however, one should note that the biochemical distinction of exo- versus endo-acting cellulases is particularly difficult to establish experimentally. interestingly, an enzyme from ruminococcus albus able to cleave cmc and glucomannan but particularly active on lichenin was recently described
 <cit> . many proteins in this subfamily are modular , a feature shared with many members of subfamily gh5_ <dig> as described previously.

subfamily gh5_ <dig> is currently the largest in family gh <dig>  this subfamily of extracellular enzymes, many of which are multimodular, contains a large number of characterized members that display endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activity . these endo-glucanases are distributed across the subfamily tree and are found in every major clade additional file
1: figure s1: gh5_2). one endo-glucanase from fibrobacter succinogenes s <dig> in this subfamily was reported to be active both on cmc and oat spelt xylan
 <cit> , but xylanase activity has not been observed in other members thus far. interestingly, one representative of this subfamily has been reported as a chitosanase  with transglycosylation activity
 <cit> . a bifunctional cellulase/chitosanase has also been identified in bacillus sp. nbl420
 <cit>  in a different clade. significantly, a closely related n-terminal sequence of a bifunctional cellulase/chitosanase from myxobacter sp. al- <dig> <cit> , suggests that a specific subgroup bearing both activities may exist. as for subfamily gh5_ <dig>  many members of this subfamily are multimodular, having both cbms and cellulosomal-like dockerins.

gh5_ <dig> :  endo-β- <dig> -glucanases , licheninases , and xylanases 
subfamily gh5_ <dig> members are typically extracellular bacterial enzymes, although some members come from ciliates and fungi, predominantly rumen organisms. in total, four enzyme activities have been reported for subfamily gh5_ <dig>  thus far, gh5_ <dig> is the only subfamily containing enzymes with reported xyloglucanase activity 
 <cit> . interestingly, the xyloglucanases are found in two different clades of the gh5_ <dig> subfamily tree suggesting that the switch of enzyme activity inside this subfamily occurred at different times. . licheninases  have also been described in this subfamily. significantly, endo-β- <dig> -xylanase activities  have been reported for a few enzymes, but always in conjunction with other activities. for example, the xylan degrading specific activity of clostridium cellulovorans engb and engd are both of approximately 14% of their respective specific activities on lichenan
 <cit> . such features suggest an important degree of enzyme promiscuity given the structural similarity of the β-linked substrates. however, the most commonly reported ec number for representatives of gh5_ <dig> is ec  <dig> . <dig> . except for a few fungal pathogen members of the subfamily that bear a cbm <dig> module, no other known cbm is present, in sharp contrast to what has been found for extracellular subfamilies gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig> 

gh5_ <dig> : β- <dig> -mannan-cleaving enzymes 
in subfamily gh5_ <dig>  previously named a <dig> 
 <cit> , the three reported enzyme activities are associated to the degradation or to the modification of β-mannan-containing polysaccharides. virtually all examined gh5_ <dig> enzymes possess endo-β- <dig> -mannanase activity . one exception is the tomato protein leman4a, which in addition to hydrolytic activity, can act in vitro as a mannan transglycosylase 
 <cit> . recently, mannan transglycosylase activity was also reported for two fungal gh5_ <dig> enzymes
 <cit> . it is not impossible that further gh5_ <dig> enzymes may reveal a transglycosylase activity in the future, since the distinction between hydrolytic and transglycosylase activity is dictated by the tendency of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate to be intercepted by a water molecule or a saccharide molecule, respectively. another interesting case among gh5_ <dig> members is the β-mannosidase cmman5a, which is able to release mannose from the non-reducing end of manno-oligosaccharides and -polysaccharides  and is thus exo- and not endo-acting. this difference was explained by the length of three loops which modify the active center accessibility
 <cit> . furthermore, this subfamily has both extracellular and intracellular enzymes. many gh5_ <dig> extracellular enzymes from fungi contain a cbm. in many bacteria, cbms from different families are also found appended to gh5_ <dig> catalytic modules .

gh5_ <dig> : fungal cell wall modifying enzymes
this subfamily contains only sequences of fungal origin putatively found in different cell locations: some are secreted, several present a gpi-anchor, others have single transmembrane segments and yet others appear to be intracellular. the activity exo-β- <dig> -glucanase  has been described for most of the characterized examples, all found among the apparently secreted enzymes. structural investigation of the candida albicans exg protein provides a clue to the evolution of these exo-hydrolases; the structure reveals an active site pocket shaped for cleavage of β- <dig> - but not β- <dig>  glycosidic linkages
 <cit> . surprisingly, the periplasmic exg <dig> protein from schizosaccharomyces pombe was demonstrated to be an endo-β- <dig> -glucanase , while the membrane-anchored protein exg <dig> protein was shown to produce cell wall material when over-expressed
 <cit> . two of the characterized gh5_ <dig> exo-β- <dig> -glucanases have been also described as β-glucosidases 
 <cit> .

gh5_ <dig> : β-glucosylceramidases  and  β-glucosidase 
previously known to contain a flavonoid β-glucosidase  from yeast
 <cit> , the panorama of specificities in this subfamily recently expanded to include several fungal β-glucosylceramidases  <cit> . the subfamily is grouped into a fungal clade, including three cryptococcus sequences , and a clade dominated by bacterial enzymes .

gh5_ <dig> : fungal β-diglycosidases 
 subfamily gh5_ <dig> is composed of secreted fungal proteins, two of which have been characterized as β-diglycosidases that break down plant diglycoconjugated flavonoids. deglycosylation of these compounds most often involves the sequential action of two β-glycosidases in contrast to the one-step hydrolytic release of the disaccharide moiety from the aglycone by β-diglycosidases
 <cit> . the characterized enzymes are a hesperidin 6-o-α-l-rhamnosyl-β-glucosidase  from stilbella fimetaria from which a partial sequence has been obtained
 <cit>  and a reported β-primeverosidase  from penicillium multicolor ts-5
 <cit> . this subfamily is present in the genera aspergillus and penicillium known for interaction with plants.

gh5_ <dig> : endo-β- <dig> -glycanases 
most enzymes found in subfamily gh5_ <dig> are derived from thermophiles. interestingly, characterized enzymes in this subfamily represent examples of gh <dig> enzymes with multiple activities. for instance, cel5a from thermotoga maritima exhibits activity on both β-mannan-based and β-glucan-based polymers. analyses of the tmcel5a structure have highlighted features important both for the nature of the duality and the thermostability
 <cit> .

gh5_ <dig> : endo-β- <dig> -glycanases 
gh5_ <dig> is a small subfamily with a majority of sequences from uncultured microorganisms. the dominating activity found is endo-β- <dig> -glucanase , but one enzyme has also high activity against lichenan 
 <cit> .

gh5_ <dig> endo-b- <dig> -glycanases 
several bacterial phyla are represented in subfamily gh5_ <dig>  one enzyme has a demonstrated endo-β- <dig> -mannanase activity , whereas a second enzyme exhibits licheninase activity  in addition to β-mannanase activity
 <cit> ; a 3-d structure is available for the latter enzyme.

gh5_ <dig> : endo-β- <dig> /4-glycanases  + cellodextrinase 
three different activities are found in subfamily gh5_ <dig>  which consists of sequences of bacterial origin encoding intracellular proteins. the majority of the characterized enzymes are cellulases , but there are also examples of licheninase activity 
 <cit> , and cellodextrinase activity 
 <cit> .

gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig> : bacterial enzymes active on model plant cell wall  compounds
in subfamily gh5_ <dig>  three enzymes isolated from rumen metagenomic projects have been partially characterized
 <cit> . to these, we may add a prevotella ruminicola  <dig> enzyme described as cellulase  and shown to be active against cmc, avicel, and lichenan
 <cit> . another enzyme discovered in the microbial community of the cow rumen is active on cmc and belongs to subfamily gh5_46
 <cit> . this is the single evidence of activity in this subfamily.

gh5_ <dig> : bacterial enzymes active on chitin and chitosan derivatives
several bacterial phyla are currently represented in subfamily gh5_ <dig>  mostly composed of extracellular and membrane-anchored proteins of unknown function. a single member, a partial sequence  coding for a protein from pseudomonas putida p3), over 98% identical to locus pps_ <dig>  from pseudomonas putida s <dig>  has been described as a bifunctional enzyme as it was active on preparative forms of chitin and colloidal chitosan and on the model compounds pnp-β-n-acetylglucosaminide and 4-methylumbelliferyl-n-acetyl β-d-glucosaminide
 <cit> . given that chitosanases are already present in family gh <dig>  related activities are not unexpected. interestingly, one sequence in gh5_ <dig> seems to lack the catalytic machinery .

subfamilies lacking experimental characterization
a large number of subfamilies still require evidence of enzyme activity . a large characterization effort is still needed to identify the hidden activities of these subfamilies. for a number of subfamilies, particularly for those containing bacterial enzymes, direct hints of the activities to be tested can be obtained from the additional modules present, such as cbms, but also from operon-like organizations. but the contribution of other more indirect approaches like transcriptomics and functional metagenomics using innovative sets of conditions and enlarged classes of substrates are equally potent to provide clues to enzyme function. the uncharacterized subfamilies are distributed across the gh <dig> phylogenetic tree. however, in one of the three major clades, a large block of uncharacterized subfamilies  is located between characterized subfamilies containing β-mannan-acting enzymes  . it is tempting to speculate that at least some of these uncharacterized subfamilies target substrates related to β-mannan.

unclassified gh <dig> proteins
roughly 20% of the analyzed gh <dig> sequences were not assigned to subfamilies, although some of these proteins have been characterized to different levels. the main reason for the inability to assign them to subfamilies was the lack of sufficiently related sequences to define a subfamily with at least five members. this is likely to change in the future due to a predicable increase in the number of available sequences and these unclassified sequences represent a pool out of which many more subfamilies will emerge. a total of  <dig> characterized enzymes were identified in this diverse set of non-classified sequences . interestingly, two main groups arise:  post-genomic enzyme characterizations, and  enzymes originating from functional metagenomics-based discovery and characterization. here, the cytoplasmic endo-β- <dig> -glucanase exg <dig> from the model organism schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit>  is a representative of the former efforts focused on the identification of fundamental activities. on the other hand, the archael multidomain hyperthermophilic cellulase ebi- <dig> screened for its ability to degrade cmc at high temperature represents the latter category of efforts
 <cit> .

the active enzymes are tagged by their enzyme classification  number  or by the significant positively assayed substrates that are: aehc - azcl-he cellulose; agm - azcl-galactomannan; bbg – barley β-glucan; cel <dig> – cellopentose; cmc - carboxymethyl cellulose; lic –lichenan; muc - 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-cellobioside; pcw – plant cell wall.

non-catalytic gh <dig> subfamilies and gh <dig> modules
interestingly, the analysis subjacent to the subfamily classification revealed proteins that are likely to be catalytically inactive , due to incomplete catalytic machinery . gh5_ <dig> is the only subfamily where all sequences are lacking the essential amino acids for gh activity. in addition, some members of other groups also appear to have lost their catalytic machinery, such as a xanthomonas-specific subgroup that appears to rapidly emerge from subfamily gh5_ <dig> . all three members of this subgroup present an architecture where the inactive gh <dig> module is appended to an expansin module and an adjacent cbm <dig> module at the c-terminus. although no catalytic chemical activity has been identified for expansin modules, it is significant that the knockout of celxob renders xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae kacc  <dig> avirulent
 <cit> . another emerging non-catalytic gh <dig> subfamily is closely related to subfamily gh5_ <dig>  all three members of this new subgroup are lipoproteins that combine the apparently catalytically inactive gh <dig> module with a large c-terminal extension. these two subgroups share long branches in the common gh <dig> tree suggesting rapid evolution. interestingly, a single member of subfamily gh5_ <dig> has lost the catalytic machinery. besides this loss, it is however still similar to other members of the subfamily. whether this is a snapshot of the early steps of a new arising function or a sequencing error it is premature to say. finally, the only distant gh <dig> member having lost its catalytic acid–base that has been functionally characterized is the putative carbohydrate biosensor rsi24c-gh <dig> from clostridium thermocellum atcc  <dig> <cit> . although its catalytic activity was lost, the extracellular gh <dig> module was shown to interact with crystalline cellulose so that a recognition signal could be conveyed by to its intracellular n-terminal anti-σ factor. the losses of the catalytic machinery here described convey that family gh <dig> sequences are also subject to recurring evolution that leads to novel functions. this type of evolutionary event has been described previously in other gh families. for instance, amino acid transporters derived from ancestral α-amylases are found in family gh13
 <cit> , inactivated chitinases evolved into xylanase inhibitors in family gh18
 <cit> , and mammalian lactalbumins, which are related to gh <dig> lysozymes, are all well-known examples of the recent evolution of glycosidases to acquire novel functionalities
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
when the first five historical subfamilies of gh <dig> were established in  <dig>  the total number of gh <dig> protein sequences was 21
 <cit> . more than  <dig> years later , this number has increased approximately  <dig> times to exceed  <dig> . the practical difficulties of handling such large datasets notwithstanding, this abundance of sequences is both a boon and a bane for phylogenetic analysis and functional prediction.

assigning proteins to a large gh-family, like gh <dig>  which harbors multiple specificities and activities, does not unlock the full potential of sequence-based classification. thus, one aim of the present investigation was to obtain an improved correlation between protein sequences and catalytic specificity by refining a finer hierarchical level, the subfamily, for gh <dig> members. up to  <dig> percent of the existing gh <dig> sequences were segregated into  <dig> subfamilies. of these subfamilies, a total of  <dig> contained at least one member characterized to some degree, whereas  <dig> lacked enzymatically-characterized members altogether. out of the  <dig> subfamilies characterized to some extent,  <dig> were monospecific and eleven were polyspecific . nonetheless, one activity typically predominates within polyspecific subfamilies. interestingly, both endo- and exo-acting enzymes have been observed in the same subfamily, e.g. gh5_ <dig>  gh5_ <dig> and gh5_ <dig>  illustrating that  the two types of activities reflect details of the three-dimensional structures. as a consequence of the canonical double displacement mechanism employed by gh <dig> enzymes, which involves the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, gh <dig> members can potentially catalyze transglycosylation in addition to, or instead of, hydrolysis
 <cit> . although the amount of biochemical data is presently limited, we observed that subfamily classification in gh <dig> does not appear to correlate with transglycosylation activity, thus indicating that this property is also a consequence of subtle protein structural details.

this effort provides a first comprehensive view of the coverage and distribution of the curated set of  <dig> experimentally characterized enzymes in the gh <dig> family and couples this information with an extensively updated sequence-based gh <dig> subfamily division. in particular, it provides insights into the evolution of gh <dig> proteins, and the classification results can be used to assist in candidate protein selection for enzyme discovery and bioprospecting projects. for instance, both the members from the twenty defined subfamilies lacking functional characterization, as well as the numerous phylogenetic outliers, provide a vast number of interesting targets for future studies. in particular, although a significant amount of tertiary structural data is already available for gh <dig>  the present work highlights that a large number subfamilies would benefit from a 3-d structure for at least one subfamily member. moreover, the data presented here, and available at the cazy database
 <cit>  as a community resource, will serve as a guide for protein engineering approaches exploiting the diverse activities found within the gh <dig> family.

finally, in the present climate in which sequence data is literally flooding public databases, incorrect protein function annotations are too easily propagated by automated computer-based prediction methods, thereby jeopardizing the usefulness of these annotations. increasingly rapid sequence accumulation is worsening the scenario. this problem is particularly illustrated by the gh5_ <dig> subfamily of plant and fungal proteins that are annotated as cellulases in public databases, including the widely-used arabidopsis information resource
 <cit> , despite a complete lack of experimental support for any one of its members. such excesses of over-annotation equally affect the presumed non-catalytically active proteins and subfamilies. for example, subfamily gh5_ <dig> further exemplifies the pitfalls of automated annotation: several members are publicly annotated as mannanases, although they lack the conserved catalytic machinery of the family. to avoid such error propagation, we strongly advocate designating all predicted enzymes as “gh5_n”  until an activity has been rigorously demonstrated by biochemical experimentation.

the gh <dig> subfamily classification presented here provides a framework to sort family members into meaningful, predictive categories. by taking a conservative approach to protein annotation, this method offers a rigorous strategy to avoid misleading functional prediction in large-scale genomic sequencing projects. whilst the subfamilies described herein generally act on a single substrate , it is important to stress that precise details of glycoside hydrolase function, such as the extent of endo- vs. exo- modes of cleavage or the transglycosylation-to-hydrolysis ratio is unlikely to be predictable from sequence alone. we therefore recommend that such over-reaching predictions be altogether abandoned in genomic sequence annotation. to aid and advance global efforts in de novo sequence annotation, the gh <dig> subfamily classification scheme is now publicly available at the cazy database
 <cit> .
