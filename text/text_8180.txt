BACKGROUND
over the past twenty-five years, more than six hundred families of transport systems have been identified, and these are presented in the transporter classification database, tcdb . classification is based on the transmembrane constituents that shape the membrane channels, rather than co-functioning auxiliary proteins including the energy coupling constituents
 <cit> . among the many protein families found in this database is the atp-binding cassette  superfamily , the largest functional superfamily of primary active transporters found in nature. many of these systems have been functionally characterized, and high resolution 3-dimensional structures are available for a few of them.

the abc functional superfamily consists of both uptake and efflux transport systems, all of which have been shown to utilize atp hydrolysis to energize transport
 <cit> . the x-ray crystallographic structures of several uptake porters have been solved
 <cit> . in general, individual porters of the abc superfamily contain integral membrane domains or subunits and cytoplasmic atp-hydrolyzing domains or subunits. unlike the efflux porters, many uptake systems additionally possess extracytoplasmic solute-binding receptors, assisting in the high affinity transport of solutes across the membrane
 <cit> . some abc uptake systems lack these receptors, and this abc subsuperfamily has been referred to as the ecf subsuperfamily of the abc functional superfamily
 <cit>  .

abc exporters are polyphyletic, meaning that they have arisen through multiple independent pathways to yield distinctive protein families
 <cit> . in fact, they have arisen at least three times independently, following three different pathways. the members of any one of these three families are demonstrably homologous to one another, but homology could not been established when comparing members of one family with those of another. abc <dig> exporters arose by intragenic triplication of a primordial genetic element encoding a two-transmembrane segment  hairpin structure, yielding six tms proteins. abc <dig> transporters arose by intragenic duplication of a primordial genetic element encoding three tmss, again yielding  <dig> tms proteins. abc <dig> porters arose with or without duplication of a primordial genetic element encoding four tmss, resulting in proteins having four, eight, or ten tmss
 <cit> . only in this last mentioned family are the unduplicated  <dig> tms proteins found in present day porters, and they are in the membrane as pairs, forming hetero- or homo-dimers
 <cit> . because of the limited organismal distribution and minimal sequence divergence between the protein members and the repeat units in the abc <dig> family, this last family is believed to have evolved most recently
 <cit> . it seems likely that the abc <dig> family arose first, that the abc <dig> family arose next, and that the abc <dig> family arose last
 <cit> .

in this study we predict the evolutionary pathways by which abc uptake systems of differing topologies appeared. with several technological improvements, this has become feasible, first, because of the availability of more sensitive software
 <cit> , second, because of the availability of larger numbers of homologues resulting from genome sequencing, and third, because of the application of the superfamily principle
 <cit> . this principle simply states that if protein a is homologous to protein b, and protein b is homologous to protein c, then protein a must be homologous to protein c, regardless of whether significant sequence similarity can be documented for proteins a and c. homology by definition means derived from a common ancestral protein. it is thus unnecessary to identify regions of high sequence similarity between two proteins if one or more sequences of adequate sequence similarity can be found that interlinks the aforementioned two sequences.

to establish homology between repeat elements in the transmembrane domains of abc importers, we used the superfamily principle as defined above to extend the significant internal homology decisions to other evolutionarily related proteins 
 <cit> . this principle has been used to establish homology for distantly related members of extensive superfamilies
 <cit> . as documented in this communication, we have used statistical means to establish homology for all abc uptake transporters except for tc family  <dig> a. <dig>  which clearly belongs to the abc <dig> family. additionally, we have established homology for internal repeat elements in representative transmembrane domains
 <cit> . finally, we have obtained preliminary evidence that two of the six primordial tmss in abc <dig> protein  gave rise to the  <dig> tms repeat elements in abc <dig> porters, suggesting that the evolution of abc <dig> porters preceeded that of abc <dig> porters.

many families of integral membrane transport proteins evolved independently of each other following different evolutionary pathways
 <cit> . these pathways involved intragenic multiplication events where the primordial genes presumably encoded channel-forming peptides, usually with one, two or three α-helical tmss
 <cit> . they duplicated, triplicated or quadruplicated—sometimes in a single step, sometimes in more than one step
 <cit> .

the bacterial maltose transport system proteins, malf  and malg  are two distinct membrane proteins that together comprise the channel of an abc superfamily member. high resolution structural information is available for this system . consequently, it is known that these two proteins differ in their tms architecture. malf has a 3 +  <dig> tms structure whereas malg has a 3 +  <dig> tms structure. we here propose that these proteins, and almost all integral membrane constituents of abc uptake systems, are of the abc2-type as noted above, arising from a 3 +  <dig> repeat topology. this raises the question of how the malf protein arose from a malg-like precursor. the malf protein contains a long hydrophilic sequence insert between tms  <dig> and tms  <dig>  since abc <dig> proteins resulted from a  <dig> tms domain duplication, the question remained which of the malf tmss are the extra ones. since malf and malg are structurally determined membrane proteins, it was possible to draw conclusions from the publicly available coordinate sets in the protein data bank , for example, from chains f and g in “2r6g” from e. coli k <dig>  we provide evidence that the extra  <dig> tmss in malf relative to malg are tmss  <dig> and  <dig> 

the results reported here strongly suggest that the membrane constituents of abc uptake transporters evolved through pathways starting with a primordial  <dig> tms abc <dig> porter. multiple and pairwise alignments as well as hydropathy plots were created and analyzed to elucidate the evolutionary appearance of this topologically diverse group of abc uptake porters. the two primary structural repeat elements have  <dig> or  <dig> tmss which duplicated in many such proteins and quadruplicated in a few. although some uncertainty exists regarding the precise topologies of some of these integral membrane proteins, we could document their internal duplications and propose the routes taken during their evolutionary histories.

RESULTS
demonstration that most abc uptake transporters are homologous
the aim of this section is to establish common origins for the integral membrane constituents of most abc uptake systems. initially, the integral membrane constituents of one uptake transporter from each family was blasted using the blast search tool in tcdb . the resulting proteins were examined, and those that belonged to uptake systems with e-values of smaller than 1e- <dig> were retained for further studies. an example of the blast output is shown in additional file
1: table s <dig> where the query sequence was malf of e. coli .

using the multiple sequence alignment program with displayed tmss  from tcdb , the query sequence and the output sequences were aligned, and their transmembrane regions were predicted. if more than  <dig> residues containing the corresponding transmembrane α-helical segments  aligned between two proteins, and they gave an e-value of 10- <dig> or smaller, they were considered homologous. if the e-value was greater than 10- <dig>  we compared both sequences using the gap program. by our criteria, a comparison score of ≥  <dig> standard deviations , as defined by the gap program, indicates that the two sequences are homologous . for instance, the sequences yfec  and fhub  were compared using the gap program, and the comparison score  computed was  <dig> s.d., well-above the value of  <dig> s.d. needed to establish homology .

using tc blast, the multiple sequence alignment program with displayed tmss, gap and the superfamily principle, we could show that large portions of representative transporters from each of the various families of uptake porters are homologous . initially, transporters of some families could not be shown to be homologous using these methods. membrane proteins from these subfamilies were then blasted against the ncbi protein databank, and the gi numbers of hits were obtained using gi-extract from tcdb. the gi numbers of the protein homologues were searched on ncbi in order to obtain their fasta sequences, and a modified cd-hit program was used to eliminate redundant and closely related proteins
 <cit> . protein homologues from different transporters were compared using ssearch. comparison scores above  <dig> s.d. were sought. a combination of programs such as gap and the global alignment program with displayed tmss   were used to establish homology. table  <dig> presents evidence that by the criteria presented here and in our previous publications, all integral membrane constituents of abc uptake porters except tc family  <dig> a. <dig>  are homologous .

 <dig> since completion of the work reported here, a new abc family  has been introduced into tcdb.  <dig> ; etct gave e- <dig> with  <dig>  and e- <dig> with  <dig>  and  <dig> , thus indicating homology between families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

 <dig> usually, superfamilies in tcdb, half of which have been introduced during the last  <dig>  years, contain multiple tc families . however, in  <dig> a. <dig>  all recognized members of this family were initially included under  <dig> a. <dig>  this is a historical fact that cannot be readily corrected because the iubmb and uniprot require a stable system of classification. subsequently, we could show that other families previously existing in tcdb were members of this superfamily. the same was true for the mfs. thus, we call what would normally be called “subfamilies” the families for both the mfs  and the apc . the same is true for the abc functional superfamily, except that the membrane proteins actually comprise three superfamilies, abc <dig>  abc <dig> and abc <dig> as discussed above
 <cit> .

 <dig> the numbers in bold indicate comparison scores expressed in s.d
 <cit> . non-bolded numbers are the exponential numbers  obtained with tc-blast. for instance, the number “12” in the first row of column  <dig> indicates that the comparison score between  <dig>  cymf and  <dig>  bite was e- <dig>  the tc# provided is the family/protein number . the first three digits in the tc#  refer to the abc functional superfamily and are not shown. they are the same for all entries. the protein tc# is followed by the protein abbreviation. all members of a single family are demonstrably homologous, giving high comparison scores . any two families for which a number is provided in the table below are demonstrably homologous based on the criteria stated in the methods section. all proteins are within the abc superfamily , but only the family and protein tc#s are provided below, e.g.  <dig>  means  <dig> a. <dig> . <dig>  i.e., abc family  <dig>  member  <dig> 

topological analyses of abc uptake system
abc uptake systems, found only in prokaryotes and chloroplasts, contain porters of diverse topological types, and in this section we attempt to predict these topologies. our studies, reported below, allow us to propose that the primordial transporter contained three tmss, which duplicated internally to give six tms homologues
 <cit> . as demonstrated here, membrane constituents of abc uptake systems except those of family  <dig> are of the abc <dig> type. however, the actual transporters appearing on the tcdb website contain various numbers of tmss that range from four or five to twenty. for some families of uptake systems such as families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the porters are more topologically diverse than those from other families such as  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  table 
 <dig> presents these families and summarizes the topological types predicted for members of uptake porter families.

 <dig> most uptake porters are of the abc <dig> type. however, tc#  <dig> a. <dig>  porters belong to the abc <dig> type. blasting family  <dig> porters yielded abc <dig> exporters in families tc#  <dig> a. <dig>  to tc#  <dig> a. <dig> 
 <cit> .

proteins were derived from tcdb.

identifying internal repeats
internal  <dig> tms repeats in  <dig> tms proteins
as previously shown for abc <dig> exporters, we here show that membrane proteins of abc uptake porters arose by an initial gene duplication event where a  <dig> tms-encoding genetic element duplicated to give  <dig> tms proteins. initial sequences were obtained from tcdb using malg from e. coli  as the query sequence in blast searches of the ncbi databank. the crystallographic structure of the e. coli maltose transporter has been solved
 <cit> , and malg has six tmss, in agreement with the topological predictions obtained by the what, hmmtop and tmhmm  <dig>  programs. figure 
1a shows a hydropathy plot of malg obtained with the what program
 <cit> .

the n-terminal half of malg, containing tmss 1– <dig>  was compared with tmss 4– <dig> using the gap program. the resulting comparison score, expressed in s.d., was below  <dig> and therefore did not prove the presence of an internal repeat. homologues of malg were obtained by using the ncbi blast, ssearch and gi-extract programs. the redundant and very similar homologues were eliminated using the cd-hit program with a cut-off value of 90% identity, and fragmentary sequences were manually eliminated. the rest of the homologues were aligned using clustalx, and their tms positions were located in the resulting alignment file. search was then used to compare the first three tmss of all homologues against their second three tmss. the results were transferred to the computer by the program fugu. when viewing a pair of sequences giving a high comparison score, the gap and map-tms programs from tcdb were used to confirm that the tmss of homologues matched with tmss in malg. all of these alignments yielded comparison scores well above  <dig> standard deviations, between malg and its homologues. for example, a homologue of malg with gi number  <dig> gave a value of  <dig> s.d. with 46% similarity and 31% identity when compared with the e. coli malg . in fact, many malg homologues proved to be homologous throughout their lengths with all six tmss aligning well with each other.

an alignment between gi <dig> and malg is shown in additional file
1: figure s2b, demonstrating that all of their tmss align. the alignment of these two sequences gave a comparison score of  <dig> s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity. these results demonstrate that all members of family  <dig> a. <dig>  are homologous throughout their lengths. therefore, it is appropriate to compare tmss 1– <dig> with tmss 4– <dig> with each other for any of these homologs.

having established that all tmss among the proteins that will be examined to prove homology between the two halves paired up and gave highly significant comparison scores, the next step was to determine if malg homologues contain internal repeats. the comparison in figure 
1b shows tmss 1– <dig> of gi <dig> aligning with tmss 4– <dig> of gi <dig>  this resulted in a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d., thereby establishing that tmss 1– <dig> are homologous to tmss 4– <dig>  similar procedures were used in the analyses reported below.

internal six tms repeats in twelve tms proteins
in some instances, six tms transporters duplicated to produce proteins with twelve tmss, and in this section, such duplications are demonstrated. a representative twelve tms protein found in tcdb is the ferric iron porter futb , many homologues of which are present in cyanobacteria .

two twelve tms homologues are gi <dig> and gi <dig>  by using gap-tms , we showed that their tmss aligned with futb. the alignment between the established ferric iron porter and gi <dig> is shown in additional file 1: figure s3a. as indicated by the gap program, the comparison score calculated for this alignment was  <dig> s.d. .

the tms alignment between the ferric iron transporter and gi <dig> is shown in additional file
1: figure s3b. it is clear that tmss 1– <dig> of the homologue pairs up with the corresponding tmss in futb. the gap program yielded a comparison score of  <dig> s.d. .

the first six tmss of gi <dig> were aligned with the second six tmss of gi <dig> . the gap program gave a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity, showing that the two sequences are homologous.

internal five tms repeats in some  <dig> tms transporters
in this section, some  <dig> tms proteins are shown to have arisen by duplication of a  <dig> tms element. a representative putative ten tms uptake porter, rnsc  and its close homologues, usually predicted to have a  <dig> tms topology using topcons
 <cit> , and tmhmm , but predicted to have  <dig> or  <dig> tmss using hmmtop, takes up ribonucleosides and their 2-deoxy derivatives. the topological predictions obtained by the tmhmm program are shown in figure 
3a. it seemed possible that what appears to be tmss 1– <dig> and tmss 6– <dig> are repeats. it should be noted, however, that topological predictions by the various programs were not consistent, and that some uncertainty exists for this protein and its close homologs. this conclusion did not prevent establishment of the proposed internal repeat.

the rnsc protein was ncbi blasted to obtain homologues, which were run through cd-hit to eliminate redundant and strikingly similar sequences . the remaining hits were aligned using the clustalx program. using ssearch, putative tmss 1– <dig> of all homologues were compared with putative tmss 6– <dig>  the results showed that homologues in genbank gi <dig> and gi <dig>  probably contain internal five tms duplications . when the first half of gi <dig> was aligned with the second half of gi <dig>  a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity was obtained .

internal repeats of  <dig> tmss in other  <dig> tms transporters, and of  <dig> tmss in  <dig> tms transporters
in this section, we examine other putative  <dig> tms proteins and compare predictions with 3-dimensional structures. btuc , a vitamin b <dig> porter constituent, which contains ten tmss according to the high resolution x-ray crystallographic structure
 <cit> , was first examined. however, the what, hmmtop and tmhmm  <dig>  programs all predicted nine tmss . the topological predictions by what and by x-ray crystallography are shown in figures 
 <dig> and
 <dig>  respectively. the missing tms in figure 
 <dig> is between putative tmss  <dig> and  <dig> 

the gap program was run for tmss 1– <dig> of gi <dig> aligning with tmss 6– <dig> of gi <dig>  the result, shown in figure 
 <dig>  gave a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity. these results clearly show the presence of two internal repeats.

we were able to demonstrate an internal repeat for a twenty tms transporter, fhub , a protein that catalyzes the transport of iron hydroxamates across the cytoplasmic membrane
 <cit> . its tmss 1– <dig> aligned with tmss 11– <dig>  as shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  the comparison score calculated was  <dig> s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity, demonstrating that tmss 1– <dig> and tms 11– <dig> resulted from a relatively recent intragenic duplication event.

evolutionary relationships among uptake porters with differing numbers of tmss
in this section, we aim to understand how the abc uptake porters predicted to contain different numbers of tmss relate to one another.

understanding the relationships between putative five and six tms transporters
the five tms porter investigated in this part of our study is hism , involved in mediating histidine uptake. the hydropathy plot is shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  a hundred non-redundant homologues of hism were obtained via blast, and the average hydropathy plot, based on the multiple alignment, was derived using the avehas program . the results confirm that hism is indeed a  <dig> tms protein.

to demonstrate the relationship between the five tms hism and the six tms malg protein, their sequences were aligned. as seen from the alignment shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  tmss 2– <dig> of a malg homologue, gi <dig>  aligned with tmss 1– <dig> of a hism homologue , resulting in a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. . the extra tms in malg, not present in hism, is therefore tms <dig> 

tmss 1– <dig> of a ten tms porter, btuc  homologue, gi <dig>  aligned with tmss 1– <dig> of the six tms porter, malg  homologue, gi <dig>  yielding a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity . these results indicate that in this case, the six tms porter lost one tms at its c-terminus to give rise to the five tms porter. thus, at least two events gave rise to a 5-tms topology from a primordial  <dig> tms protein, one in which the n-terminal tms was lost, and one in which the c-terminal was lost.

understanding the relationships between putative six and seven tms porters
to demonstrate the relationship between transporters that exhibit six or seven predicted tmss, two proteins were chosen: malg , a six tms porter, and togn , a putative seven tms porter. the topological predictions obtained by what and hmmtop for the latter protein both gave seven tmss; however, tmhmm predicted this protein to be a six tms porter. the six tms topology is also confirmed by topcons and spoctupus, which according to our unpublished evaluations are the most reliable topological prediction programs currently available. the hydropathy plot of togn obtained with the what program is shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig> 

we obtained the top twenty non-redundant homologues of this protein and used what and tmhmm to predict the topology of each of these homologues. the results are presented in additional file
1: table s <dig>  the top twenty non-redundant hits to togn were examined using the avehas program . the average hydropathy plot for these proteins is shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig> 

togn , the putative seven tms porter, aligned with the six tms malg homologue, gi <dig>  tmss 1– <dig> of both proteins aligned, giving a comparison score of  <dig> s.d. with 30% similarity and  <dig> % identity .

tmss 4– <dig> of malg aligned with tmss 4– <dig> of the togn homologue, gi <dig>  the result  gave a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity. we suggest that both proteins have  <dig> tmss, and that the  <dig> tms prediction is not accurate. thus, sequences similar to abc porters predicted to have  <dig> tmss may have  <dig> tmss.

understanding the relationships between putative six and ten tms transporters
malg , a six tms transport protein, was aligned with the putative ten tms protein rnsc  to elucidate the relationship between six and ten tms porters. homologues of both malg and rnsc were aligned with malg and rnsc, respectively, using the gap and multiple sequence alignment programs to verify that their tmss aligned in a pattern that would reveal their evolutionary relationships. then, tmss 1– <dig> of a malg homologue  were aligned with tmss 1– <dig> of the rnsc homologue  using gap. the output gave a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity . we conclude that the fourth and fifth tmss of the rnsc homologue are extra tmss.

tmss 4– <dig> of a six tms homologue  aligned with tmss 6– <dig> of a putative ten tms homologue . the result gave a comparison score of  <dig> s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity . the ninth and tenth tmss of gi <dig> did not align well with any tms of gi <dig>  overall, these results indicate that two extra tmss inserted at the c-terminus of a primordial three tms protein, followed by an intragenic duplication that gave rise to a ten tms protein.

in a parallel study, we aligned tmss 1– <dig> of the putative  <dig> tms rnsc homologue, gi <dig>  with tmss 1– <dig> of the six tms malg homologue, gi <dig>  the alignment is shown in figure 
 <dig>  resulting in a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. . this result suggests that tms  <dig> in the  <dig> tms protein are from tms  <dig> in the  <dig> tms precursor before duplication of the  <dig> tms unit to give the  <dig> tms protein. the proposal that the  <dig> tms protein arose by fusion of a  <dig> tms unit with a  <dig> tms fragment is therefore less probable, for the case of gi <dig>  thus, the last tms of a  <dig> tms homologue may have been lost before duplication to give rise to the  <dig> tms homologue. because of the sequence identity reported in this paragraph, we prefer this last explanation.

understanding the relationships between putative nine and ten tms transporters
the putative nine tms protein, hmuu , was aligned with the known ten tms porter, btuc . the sixth tms from btuc did not align with a tms in hmuu. the alignment is shown in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  the comparison score is  <dig>  s.d. with 52% similarity and  <dig> % identity. this high comparison score suggests that the  <dig> tms prediction for hmuu is inaccurate; it may have  <dig> tmss as does btuc. it should be recalled that btuc was also predicted to have  <dig> tmss, although the crystal structure revealed  <dig> tmss .

understanding the relationships between different ten tms porters
tmss 1– <dig> of a putative ten tms protein, an rnsc  homologue, gi <dig>  was aligned with tmss 1– <dig> of the ten tms protein, btuc  homologue, gi <dig>  yielding a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity . next, tmss 6– <dig> of one ten tms homologue, gi <dig>  were aligned with tmss 1– <dig> of another ten tms  homologue , yielding a comparison score of  <dig>  s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity . these results show that all five tmss in the repeat sequences of both proteins can be aligned and exhibit enough similarity to provide evidence of a common origin. it should be noted that inversion of tmss, hairpin structures and entire protein halves have been documented following alteration of the membrane lipid composition
 <cit> , but this appears not to be applicable to the proteins studied here.

understanding the relationships between present-day abc <dig> proteins and their ancestral sequence
 <dig> homologues of abc <dig> uptake systems were extracted from the ncbi protein database using ncbi blast. out of these homologues, those having  <dig> tmss were filtered using hmmtop
 <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> homologues  examined were predicted to have  <dig> tmss. these proteins were divided into their two halves, each containing three tmss. multiple alignments of each unit were achieved using clustalw
 <cit> . sequences introducing too many gaps in the multiple alignments were removed. ancescon was used to construct the root primordial sequence using marginal reconstruction and a maximum likelihood rate factor from alignment-based pi vectors. this program predicts ancestral sequences, usually reliable with confidence levels proportional to the number of homologues available for analysis . if two proteins, having little sequence similarity derived from a common source, their two ancestral sequences may reveal much greater similarity to each other than any of the present day sequences of the two groups exhibit to each other. various tmss within the root primordial sequence  as well as the original sequences were subjected to pairwise comparisons using gap. the comparison scores obtained by gap are presented in table 
 <dig>  figure 
 <dig> shows the gap comparison of the first half of the ancestral sequence with its second half, resulting in a comparison score of  <dig>  standard deviations,  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity. this confirms the usefulness of the ancescon program in predicting ancestral sequences. it also confirms the conclusion that the  <dig> tms precursor element duplicated to give rise to the  <dig> tms proteins with two  <dig> tms repeat units.

structural superposition of malf and malg
in chimera  <dig> , we used a function called “matchmaker” for structural comparisons, always using malf fragments as reference for all ensuing superimpositions. we iterated by pruning long atom pairs, until no pair exceeded  <dig> Ångström. for the last  <dig> tms superimposition, the result was excellent. we saved the superimposed structures in a single file. in the “reply log”, we could see that the rmsd between  <dig> atom pairs was  <dig>  Ångström. there is a slight shift, based on the start point of the superimposition, giving slightly higher rmsd values for the last  <dig> tmss.

the motif “dxw+lal” is located at the beginning of the long insert in malf and also in a short insert between tms <dig> and tms <dig> in malg. the presence of the short insert between tms <dig> and tms <dig> in malg, and the presence and location of this motif, would suggest that it is the first two tmss in malf that should be “chopped” or considered as the “extra” tms pair. the superimposition between tms  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in malf that corresponds to tms  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in malg resulted in an rmsd between  <dig> atom pairs of  <dig>  Ångström, confirming our assumptions.

to facilitate sequence comparison between the first domain duplicated  <dig> tms unit in malf and malg, we removed parts of the long insert in malf , and based on the presence of  <dig> residues after the dxw+lal motif in malg, we removed  <dig> amino acyl residues . we also took out the sequence . after this editing, the respective sequences had the lengths  <dig> and  <dig>  using protocols  <dig> and  <dig>  we found that this comparison resulted in a gsat z-score of  <dig> s.d. the importance of the dxw+lal motif was that it was the only motif conserved between the two sequences that we discovered when we compared malf and malg. it was important because it helped to establish correspondance between the long insert in malf and a shorter, but still extended, loop in malg.

in chimera, we attempted a superposition of the first and last  <dig> tmss of malg, using the last  <dig> tmss as the reference for superimposition . for malf, we took the last  <dig> tmss, and then 270– <dig> only . we repeated this, but without removing the insert, using residues 65– <dig> as the reference. these tests failed and did not result in a credible superimposition.

the start and end of malf generated two lists from protocol  <dig> each. analyzing these lists in protocol  <dig> revealed that they contain many identical hits, the highest scoring common entry being “sba1”, scoring  <dig> against itself in gsat. this may be the expected outcome when we analyze parts of the same sequence. to better evaluate similarity between the first and second  <dig> tms units, we took the first half from malg and the final  <dig> tmss from malf. for this comparison, we observed a comparison score of  <dig> s.d.

to compare our interpretation that malf has  <dig> additional tmss at its n-terminus, a long insert between tmss  <dig> and  <dig>  and that it differs from the other proteins that have a putative  <dig> tms structure , such as rnsc which is discussed at length in this report, we used protocol <dig> to generate a list of rnsc homologues. we then used protocol <dig> to compare malf and rnsc. in fact, the best scoring pair between rnsc and malf scored  <dig> s.d., but careful examination of the gsat alignment showed that the tmss did not align well. while  <dig> sequence pairs scored  <dig> s.d. or greater, the actual alignments did not cover the full sequence length and contained misaligned tms segments. this illustrates the point that these sequences are not closely related in spite of their distant sequence similarities that presumably reflect their common origin. furthermore, while we consider rnsc to be a 5 +  <dig> tms protein, some programs such as tmhmm predict  <dig> or  <dig> tmss, having  <dig> weak tms predictions between tms  <dig> and  <dig> in both of the domain duplicated units. this uncertainty has been discussed in detail above.

possible origin of abc <dig> porters from abc <dig> porters
many abc <dig> porters were aligned with many abc <dig> porters. in almost all cases , tmss  <dig> and  <dig> in the abc <dig> porters aligned with tmss  <dig> and  <dig> in the abc <dig> porters as the high scoring pairwise comparisons. the alignment of tmss  <dig> and  <dig> from the type i porter protein, gi <dig>  and the type ii porter protein, gi <dig>  is shown in figure 
 <dig>  this alignment resulted in a comparison score of  <dig> s.d. with  <dig> % similarity and 39% identity. the results indicate that abc <dig> and abc <dig> proteins are somehow related, although the possibility of convergent sequence similarity must be considered as an alternative explanation, given the short lengths of the sequences being compared.

the fact that the tmss shared are  <dig> and  <dig> in both proteins, where 3– <dig> of abc <dig> are the last and first tmss of the two repeat sequences, while tmss 3– <dig> of abc <dig> comprise the central  <dig> tms repeat unit, suggested that if these tmss do exhibit this degree of sequence similarity due to divergent evolution from a common ancestral sequence, abc <dig> proteins must have preceded abc <dig> proteins. however, the shortness of the sequences compared  renders this conclusion tentative. regardless, from x-ray crystallographic studies, it is clear that abc <dig> and abc <dig> proteins do not have a common fold, and therefore have not retained 3-dimensional structural features as expected
 <cit> .

to understand why tmss  <dig> and  <dig> of both transporter types proved to show the greatest sequence similarity, the three repeat units in abc <dig> porter were examined. the results revealed that sequence divergence of the first and third repeats was greater than that of the central repeat . this observation could explain why the central repeats of abc <dig> porters were recognized as similar to the potential precursors, tmss  <dig> and  <dig> of abc <dig> porters, while the first and third repeats were not.

discussion
essentially all abc uptake transporters are homologous
the results reported in table 
 <dig>  provide statistical evidence that all  <dig> families of abc uptake porters, except family  <dig>  contain integral membrane proteins that are homologous to each other. they are believed to have arisen from a  <dig> tms precursor which duplicated to give  <dig> tms porters, many of which are represented in present day integral membrane uptake and export transport systems. however, although alternative topological variants have arisen , we could demonstrate homology using a cut-off point of  <dig>  s.d. for a stretch of at least  <dig> continuous amino acyl residues. because of the tremendous topological variation, we do not expect all of these proteins to exhibit the same 3-dimensional folds although so far, this has been the case. the one exceptional family of solute uptake porters that could not be shown to be homologous to other abc uptake porters was family  <dig>  which clearly is related to abc <dig> export proteins.

topological uncertainties
the abc uptake transporters whose x-ray structures were available at the time of writing are the vitamin b <dig> porter of e. coli 
 <cit> , the probable metal chelate uptake system of haemophilus influenzae 
 <cit> , the methionine transporter of e. coli 
 <cit> , the maltose porter of e. coli 
 <cit>  and the molybdate porter of methanosarcina acetivorans 
 <cit> . all of these transport systems have similar folds in agreement with our understanding that these uptake systems  derived from a common ancestor. this fold differs from that of the abc <dig> efflux porters for which x-ray structures are available
 <cit> .

the topological predictions obtained by the what and tmhmm programs indicated that malg  is a six tms porter, in agreement with the x-ray structural data
 <cit> . however, the vitamin porter, btuc , and hi <dig> were both predicted to contain  <dig> tmss by both programs, and topcons, yet the x-ray structures shows there to be 10
 <cit> . both modb and meti were predicted to have  <dig> tmss using all three programs, and the x-ray structures confirmed this conclusion. no such data are available for the histidine permease protein, hism from salmonella typhimurium. the topologies predicted by what, topcons and tmhmm for this porter are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tmss, respectively. similar disagreements occurred for several other uptake porters . overall, our data suggest that the topological predictions obtained using the standard bioinformatic programs are helpful but not fully reliable. average hydropathy plots, obtained using the avehas program for members of a family should be used for more reliable topological predictions when conflicting topological predictions arise. this practice was followed here. while some families of transporters give consistently reliable predictions with programs such as hmmtop and tmhmm  and apc  family members), some such as members of the largely eukaryotic mitochondrial carrier family , the ubiquitous trk family and the prokaryotic-specific phosphoenol-pyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system  do not
 <cit> .

since almost all abc uptake systems proved to be homologous to abc <dig> efflux systems, it is possible that abc <dig> efflux systems were the precursors of these uptake systems. however, evidence for this postulate is weak. the argument depends in part on the fact that efflux systems are ubiquitous while uptake systems are essentially lacking in eukaryotes. an alternative postulate will be presented elsewhere . we propose that abc <dig> porters were primordial proteins that predated both abc <dig> and abc <dig> proteins, but this postulate is highly speculative.

proposed pathway for the appearance of abc uptake systems
our proposed pathway for the appearance of abc uptake systems of differing topologies is shown in figure 
 <dig>  a primordial  <dig> tms porter duplicated internally to give rise to a  <dig> tms porter
 <cit> , and this  <dig> tms porter again duplicated to give rise to a  <dig> tms porter. possibly a primordial  <dig> tms porters could have arisen via either of two routes: first, one tms might have been added at the c-terminus of the three tms precursor, or second, the six tms porter could have lost two tmss at its c-terminus. although speculation in view of the uncertainties of the topological predictions, the second route is favored . further, one tms could have been added between the 5th and 6th tmss of a  <dig> tms porter to give rise to a  <dig> tms porter; however, the occurrence of this  <dig> tms topological type is less likely and may be due to erroneous predictions by the hmmtop and tmhmm programs.

starting with similar  <dig> tms internally duplicated primordial  <dig> tms porters, one tms was apparently deleted at the n-terminus to gives rise to some of the current  <dig> tms porters. in a distinct event, a  <dig> tms porter may have lost a c-terminal tms to give rise to a different  <dig> tms type of porter. these two events, giving rise to two recognizably distinct  <dig> tms homologues, undoubtedly occurred independently of each other as indicated in figure 
 <dig> 

although likely, it is not absolutely certain that a  <dig> tms protein gave rise to the c-terminally truncated  <dig> tms homologue in a single step. possibly, the  <dig> tms protein arose in two steps via a  <dig> tms intermediate. four-tms abc uptake porter proteins could have existed
 <cit>  as their  <dig> tms duplicated products may exist today, but this suggestion is not well documented. because tmss  <dig> in the  <dig> tms homologues do not show appreciable sequence similarity with tms  <dig> in the  <dig> tms proteins , we cannot securely distinguish the route from a  <dig> tms or a  <dig> tms precursor. however, the simpler one step pathway is favored. intragenic duplication of a  <dig> tms homologue gave rise to the  <dig> tms porters, and the  <dig> tms porter duplicated internally to give rise to the  <dig> tms porters. aligning the first ten tmss with the second ten tmss of the twenty tms porters yielded high comparison scores , indicating that this intragenic duplication event happened relatively recently in evolutionary time.

we have succeeded in using public structural data to show that tmss  <dig> and  <dig> are the two “extra” helices in the malf sequence compared to malg. this means that malf differs from malg in two overarching ways, by having the two additional tmss at the start of the sequence, and secondly, by having a much longer insert between tms  <dig> and  <dig>  however, we also noted that the malg sequence may contain a small insert in the corresponding position between tmss  <dig> and  <dig> 

we have used protocol <dig> to confirm that, for the last three tmss, there is equivalence between malf and malg. the gsat z-score was  <dig> s.d. for the best scoring pair of related sequences found using protocol <dig>  this is far in excess of what is required to establish homology. comparisons between malf and malg, using programs such as clustalw <dig> is complicated because of the long insert. pairwise blastp searches identified a couple of motifs, such as “dxw+lal”, but the sequence similarity was not obvious outside of these motif regions. this can perhaps be compared with cases of homology modeling of orthologous proteins between closely related species, where structure modeling is attempted based on highly similar sequences and result in comparable rmsd scores of < <dig> for sequences of length ~ <dig> 

the partial sequences for malf and malg have very similar folds, apparent in the superpositions presented here, where the domain-duplicated  <dig> tms units resulted in rmsd values near or below  <dig>  the general value of this comparison is illustrated by establishment of a reference point for interpretation of gsat scores using structural comparisons. thus, we have shown that very similar folds correspond to sequence similarity resulted in gsat scores above twenty. it is clear that the modifications  that gave rise to the  <dig> tms malf from a  <dig> tms malg-like precursor occurred after the duplication of  <dig> tmss to give  <dig> tmss, but the duplication of the  <dig> tms precursor to give  <dig> tms proteins occurred after the loss of an n- or c-terminal tms from the  <dig> tms precursor.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results reported in this communication are consistent with our more general conclusion that most abc uptake integral membrane proteins arose from the basic abc <dig> topology modified by a variety of insertions/deletions  which sometimes occurred before duplication generating the full-length proteins as documented in several examples. sometimes these occurred after this duplication event occurred, as documented for malf. it seems clear that during the evolution of abc uptake proteins, these intragenic duplication events occurred multiple times as also suggested for other families of transporters
