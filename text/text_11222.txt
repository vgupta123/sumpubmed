BACKGROUND
cultivated peanut  is the second-most important grain legume crop worldwide after soybean, with a production of  <dig> million tons in 2003/ <dig>  <cit> . peanut is produced throughout the tropics and warmer regions of the subtropics, but is particularly important in africa, asia and in the united states  <cit> . it is an allotetraploid  of recent origin that arose from hybridization of two wild species and spontaneous chromosome duplication  <cit> . this polyploidization event gave rise to a severe genetic bottle-neck  <cit>  which has led to lack of variability in some important traits, limited availability of allelic combinations and consequently restrictions in productivity. in addition, the very low level of polymorphism in cultivated peanut has hampered genetic and genomic characterization. in contrast, diploid wild relatives of peanut have high genetic diversity and have been selected during evolution in a range of environments and biotic stresses, constituting a rich source of allele diversity  <cit> . wild alleles can be introduced into the gene-pool of cultivated peanut using a "resynthesis" pathway, essentially artificially recreating events similar to those that gave rise to the origin of the crop species  <cit> . recent advances in the knowledge of the relationships of wild and cultivated genomes through traditional taxonomy, cytogenetics and molecular studies are enabling new choices of wild species for resynthesis  <cit> . in parallel new genetic and genomic tools  for monitoring the introgression of wild genes into a cultivated background are opening the perspectives for the efficient introgression of wild genes into the peanut crop using molecular breeding.

the very low level of polymorphism in cultivated peanut has hampered genetic mapping and qtl  studies. consequently only a few linkage maps have been published. all of them have used wild species to enable the generation of sufficient polymorphic markers. restriction fragment length polymorphism  maps were developed by halward based on a cross of two aa genome species, a. stenosperma krapov. & wc gregory and a. cardenasii krapov. & wc gregory, and a tetraploid map based on a cross of txag- <dig>  and a. hypogaea was published by burow et al.  <cit> . recently, we developed an ssr-based map for the aa genome of arachis based on a cross of a. stenosperma and a. duranensis krapov. & wc gregory  <cit>  and a map of the bb genome, based on a cross of a. ipaënsis krapov., wc gregory & ce simpson and a. magna krapov., wc gregory & ce simpson  <cit> . currently there are  <dig>  ests for a. hypogaea in genbank  <cit> , and  <dig>  for the wild aa genome a. stenosperma  <cit> .

bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries are fundamental tools for genomic studies, being important for physical mapping, map-based gene cloning and analysis of gene structure and function. the easy handling and propagation of the clones, their relatively stability and low degree of chimerism compared with yeast artificial chromosome  vectors have made bac vectors the cloning system of choice  <cit> . a number of strategies have been proposed for physical mapping with large-insert clones: hybridisation-based methods such as interactive hybridisation using individual cdna or genomic clones as probes  <cit> , restriction-based fingerprinting methods  <cit>  integrated bac end sequencing and fingerprint analysis  <cit>  or more recently, the use of oligonucleotide-based "overgos"  <cit> .

within the leguminosae, bac libraries are available for phaseolus vulgaris  <cit> , vigna radiata  <cit> , glycine max  <cit> , trifolium pretense  <cit>  and the model legumes lotus japonicus  <cit>  and medicago truncatula  <cit> . within the genus arachis, one bac library for the allopolyploid cultivated peanut has been developed  <cit> . as a complement to this resource, here we describe the production of bac libraries for the two diploid wild species a. duranensis  and a. ipaënsis  that have been identified as the most probable ancestors of cultivated peanut  <cit> . using whole genome in-situ hybridization  we also further investigated the affinities and coverage of the selected diploid genomes compared to those present in a. hypogaea.

RESULTS
in-situ hybridizations
total genomic dna of a. duranensis  and a. ipaënsis  when used as probes on the chromosomes of a. hypogaea displayed intense and uniform hybridization patterns onto aa and bb chromosomes of a. hypogaea respectively . this clear genome discrimination of the chromosome subsets from the corresponding parental genomes in the tetraploids was possible without the need of any unlabelled blocking dna, which is normally used to avoid cross-hybridization between a specific probe from one genome and homologous dna sequences from another genome. counterstained a and b chromosomes show very similar total sizes for the two genomic components .

high molecular weight  dna isolation
the use of standard hmw dna isolation protocols  <cit>  did not produce sufficient amounts of good quality nuclei for arachis. high levels of carbohydrate and polyphenols are present in both a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis leaves. this results in high viscosity leaf extracts, which are difficult to filtrate, increasing considerably the time of the nuclei exposure to the action of oxidizing substances. to overcome this problem, some modifications were necessary: inclusion of pvp- <dig> in the extraction buffer, filtration of leaf extracts in four layers of cheesecloth followed by two layers of miracloth, centrifugation at low speed  and a percoll gradient . the analysis of the extracts by dapi-staining microscopy enabled the correct evaluation of the amount and quality of the nuclei preparations.

the inclusion of an extra purification step, consisting of pfge of agarose plugs for  <dig> min before digestion, enabled the purging of smaller fragments and eliminated impurities, increasing cloning efficiency. to obtain the highest amount of restricted dna after electro-elution, only  <dig> μl was recovered at the very bottom of the collection tube instead of  <dig> μl as described in the standard protocol  <cit> . after the double size selection, various ratios of ligation were tested with the 1/ <dig> v/i ratio resulting in the greatest number of transformants. overall, five different ligations were necessary to obtain each bac library .

bac libraries characterisation
the bac library for the aa genome  contained  <dig>  clones whilst the bb genome library  consisted of  <dig>  . a random sample of each library was analyzed by noti digestion, and the average insert size was  <dig> and  <dig> kb for a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis respectively .

the organelle contamination in both bac libraries was evaluated by screening the high-density filters with mitochondrial and chloroplast specific probes. for a. duranensis, the contamination of bac clones with chloroplast sequences was of  <dig> % and mitochondrial sequences of  <dig> %. for a. ipaënsis  <dig> % was contaminated with chloroplast sequences and  <dig> % of the clones with mitochondrial dna. these values, together with the microscopic dapi-staining observations, reflect the high level of purification of the arachis nuclei obtained with the modified protocol.

based on the library average insert size and a. duranensis haploid genome, equivalent to  <dig> mb  <cit> , the estimated coverage of the aa genome bac library is of  <dig>  haploid genome equivalents. however, for a. ipaënsis, the dna-content determination is controversial. it is possible that the haploid genome equivalent of  <dig>  mb reported by singh et al  <cit>  is a  <dig>  fold overestimate because of measurement inconsistencies, as already described for other arachis species  <cit>  therefore the bb genome bac library for a. ipaënsis could represent from  <dig>  to  <dig>  the haploid genome equivalents of the species. considering that a and b chromosomes show very similar sizes for the two genomic components of the tetraploid  we consider that latter to be a better estimate. to further test the coverage, high-density filters were screened with probes corresponding to single copy gene used as anchor markers in legume and that have been placed on the arachis aa genetic map . an average of  <dig>  clones per probe was identified in the aa genome and  <dig>  in the bb .

* not tested

the hybridization of both bac libraries with an arachis resistance gene analogue rga s1_a_ <dig> identified two clones in the aa genome but none in the bb genome .

discussion
cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid with two nuclear genomic components, aa and bb. although it is generally agreed that these component genomes are derived from diploid wild ancestors, the exact species involved has been a matter of some research and discussion. although the evidence is not completely clear cut, analysis of data from molecular markers, cytogenetics, morphology and geographical distributions support that a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis are the direct ancestors of cultivated peanut  <cit> .

genomic in situ hybridization  of a. hypogaea metaphase chromosomes with total genomic dna from the aa genome of a. duranensis and the bb genome of a. ipaënsis allowed a clear differentiation of the a and b chromosomes. firstly, this observation reinforces the evidence of the close relationship between the genomes of a. duranensis, a. ipaënsis and cultivated peanut. secondly, since gish relies largely on the hybridization of repetitive sequences, it also indicates that a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis genomes have diverged substantially regarding their repeated sequences/transposable elements contents.

in contrast, the evidence available indicates that the gene order in the aa and bb genomes is substantially conserved  <cit> . this situation of largely syntenic gene frameworks embedded within quickly evolving repetitive dna seems to be a recurrent theme in plant evolution  <cit> .

the availability of bac libraries from the allopolyploid and the two wild ancestors will allow the comparison of these genomes regarding microsynteny and repetitive dna contents, in particular transposable elements and will provide insights into the fascinating area of polyploid genome evolution.

in addition, the legume single copy anchor markers, used to characterize the libraries, will allow orthologous regions to be identified and compared between the aa and bb arachis genomes, and with other legume genomes, in particular the sequenced genomes of lotus and medicago, providing insight into legume genome evolution.

construction of bac libraries in some plants can require substantial effort due to particular chemical constitution as already experienced by us before  <cit> . for arachis, obtaining good quality hmw dna was difficult due to contamination from polyphenols and carbohydrates, which are abundant in arachis leaves. a number of steps had to be added to the standard protocols of nuclei extraction and several ligations had to be made to obtain a reasonable number of bac clones. these difficulties were also reported by yuksel and paterson  <cit>  for the construction of the a hypogaea bac library.

the genome coverage of the bac libraries was estimated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  haploid genome equivalents for the a genome and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the b genome. these disparities are due to variations of the density of restriction sites in certain genome regions or difficulties in cloning too large or too small fragments  <cit> . considering that 99% coverage is equivalent to  <dig> × haploid genomes  <cit> a. duranensis and a ipaënsis genomes are well represented and the libraries will be suitable for many applications.

the availability of bac libraries from diploid arachis will greatly facilitate the development of a reference physical map for arachis. the construction of this physical map will be initiated soon with the a. duranensis bac library. this species was used as a parent of the mapping population used for the construction of the arachis ssr-based map  <cit> . a. ipaënsis is also the parent of a mapping population  <cit> . this will facilitate the integration of genetic and physical maps.

the exploitation of peanut's diploid wild relatives for breeding is very attractive since they possess various resistances to biotic and abiotic stresses. the two species used to make the bac libraries harbour resistances to nematode and fungal diseases <cit> . these new bac resources will help the tagging and/or the isolation of the corresponding resistance genes. for example, a qtl for resistance to late leaf spot, caused by cercosporidium personatum has been mapped in a cross of a. duranensis with a. stenosperma  <cit> . s1_a_ <dig>  a rga that co-segregates with this qtl has been used to identify two bac clones in the a. duranensis library, whilst no clones in the a. ipaënsis library were found. sequencing of the bac clones should enable the identification of microsatellites in the target region, thus providing more convenient markers for tracking the qtl in segregating populations.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, here we describe the production of bac libraries for the aa and bb genomes of arachis. the libraries will be a useful resource for the isolation of genes, the construction and correlation of physical and genetic maps, the isolation of probes for cytogenetic analysis, the study of the evolution of the two genome types, and, by comparison with the allotetraploid genome of cultivated peanut, for the study of the evolution of polyploid genomes.
