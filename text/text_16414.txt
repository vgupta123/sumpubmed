BACKGROUND
the widespread phenotype diversity within the central nervous system underscores the importance of restricting transgene expression to a specified target cell type  <cit> . failure to do so results in gene expression in non target cells that confounds data interpretation and may lead to undesirable side effects. restricting gene expression to a specified cell population within the brain by using cell-selective promoters remains an attractive approach  <cit> . in addition, cell-type-specific promoters are advantageous since they are less likely to activate host cell defense machinery and are less sensitive to cytokine-induced promoter inactivation than viral promoters  <cit> . as such, improved stability and longevity of gene expression can be expected.

the syn and gfaabc1d promoter are two such cellular promoters that may offer cell specific gene expression in neurons and glia in the cns, respectively. the syn promoter has been extensively characterized and its 495-bp 5' flanking region has been shown to drive neuron-specific expression in various regions of the brain  <cit> . gfaabc1d promoter is a compact glial fibrillary acidic protein  promoter with the size of 694-bp. it was derived from the conventional  <dig>  kb human gfap promoter  <cit> ) by deleting 5' nucleotides - <dig> to - <dig> and an internal segment from - <dig> to - <dig>  gfaabc1d has expression properties in transgenic mice indistinguishable from the  <dig>  kb version  <cit> . a general limitation of the applicability of cellular promoters, including the syn and gfaabc1d promoters, has been their relatively weak transcriptional activity compared with viral promoters such as cmv promoter. tas  has been proven to be an efficient strategy to enhance transgene expression from weak cell-specific promoters  <cit> . the basic principle of tas is to use a cell-specific promoter to drive simultaneous expression of the desired transgene and a strong artificial transcriptional activator to potentiate transcription by binding to the specific binding sites introduced into the promoter . therefore, two copies of a cell-specific promoter were involved in this strategy, one to transcribe the transgene of interest and the other to express the transactivator. however, a limitation of such dual promoter system in the context of viral gene targeting is its size, which becomes an issue when longer promoters  have to be used. lentiviral vectors  and recombinant adenoviral vector  are two commonly used viral vectors in the cns with packaging capacities of approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb respectively  <cit> . taking a recombinant adenovirus as an example, the maximum promoter sequence used in a dual promoter tas system is around  <dig> kb leaving room for one medium-sized gene. on the other hand, it is well known that the size of the promoter sequence required for specific expression can be quite large, e.g., 5~ <dig> kb and more  <cit> . therefore, application of tas in avv and lvv is restricted to small promoters and short transgenes. to broaden the application of this strategy, it is highly desirable to reduce the overall size of the expression cassettes. this was the aim of the present study.

the recent demonstration of synthetic bidirectional promoters that mediate coordinate transcription of two mrnas  <cit>  prompted us to test whether this design is applicable to tas. in synthetic bidirectional promoters a minimal core promoter is joined upstream to an efficient promoter positioned in the opposite orientation  <cit> . the rationale of the design was that upstream elements in the efficient promoter, when closely flanked by minimal promoters on both sides, drive transcriptional activity in both directions  <cit> . earlier, baron et al.  constructed tetracycline-inducible bidirectional promoters by duplicating a minimal promoter on both sides of a series of tet operator repeats to obtain exogenously regulated expression of two transgenes in a correlated, dose-dependent manner  <cit> . here we applied bidirectional promoter design in combination with tas in vitro and in vivo. we tested two cell-specific promoters, syn and gfaabc1d promoters. the properties of these two promoters were described earlier.

RESULTS
five self-inactivated hiv-derived lentiviral vectors  were constructed for this study containing:  the egfp reporter gene under the control of the syn promoter alone ,  the egfp reporter gene under the control of the gfaabc1d promoter alone ,  syn-based bidirectional promoter driving the synthesis of the transcriptional activator gal4p <dig>  and the reporter gene egfp ,  gfaabc1d-based bidirectional promoter driving the synthesis of the transcriptional activator gal4p <dig> and the reporter gene egfp . lv- <dig> × syn-egfp and lv- <dig> × gfaabc1d-egfp served as controls lacking the transcriptional activator gal4p <dig>  in lv-mcmv/syn-egfp and lv-mcmv/gfaabc1d-egfp, a minimal cmv core promoter  derived from ptre-tight-dsred <dig>  was joined in the opposite orientation to either the syn or gfaabc1d promoter to form bidirectional promoters mcmv/syn and mcmv/gfaabc1d. two gene expression cassettes flanked the bidirectional promoters. the 5' cassette transcribed the strong gal4p <dig> transactivator. the 3' cassette drove the synthesis of the reporter gene with  <dig> tandem gal <dig> binding sequences at the 5' end of the specific promoter. woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element  was included in all of the four constructs to further enhance the expression level of the reporter gene. if the bidirectional promoters mcmv/syn and mcmv/gfaabc1d are active in both directions, upstream product gal4p <dig> would bind to gal <dig> binding sequences introduced 5' of syn or gfaabc1d promoter. this we anticipated would then lead to boosted expression of egfp.

we initially analyzed the performance of the bidirectional constructs in cell culture. neuron-derived pc <dig> cells were transduced with lv- <dig> × syn-egfp and lv-mcmv/syn-egfp while glia-derived 1321n <dig> cells were transduced with lv- <dig> × gfaabc1d-egfp and lv-mcmv/gfaabc1d-egfp at moi of  <dig>  bidirectional constructs produced significantly more egfp-positive cells in both pc <dig> and 1321n <dig> cells. thus the number of egfp-positive pc <dig> cells from lv-mcmv/syn-egfp was increased ~ <dig> -fold  as compared to that from lv- <dig> × syn-egfp. similarly, expression from lv-mcmv/gfaabc1d-egfp was increased ~ <dig> -fold in  <dig> 1n <dig> cells  when compared with that from lv- <dig> × gfaabc1d-egfp. these results confirmed the boosted gene expression of both bidirectional tas-based lvv systems.

we next evaluated the performance of the new vectors in vivo in the rat brain. lvv were stereotaxically injected into the hypoglossal motor nucleus. to allow for direct comparison, we set the dose for each virus for one rat as  <dig> infectious units and transgene expression was scored one week postinjection. as shown in figure 3a, significantly stronger egfp expression was observed from lv-mcmv/syn-egfp and lv-mcmv/gfaabc1d-egfp than that from lv- <dig> × syn-egfp and lv- <dig> × gfaabc1d-egfp. nih imagej was used to quantitatively compare the relative egfp fluorescence levels. we observed a ~4-fold increase in the level of fluorescence in tissues transduced by lv-mcmv/syn-egfp than by lv- <dig> × syn-egfp  and ~9-fold increase by lv-mcmv/gfaabc1d-egfp than by lv- <dig> × gfaabc1d-egfp .

to determine whether the cell-type specificity was preserved in bidirectional promoters, we performed immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the neuron-specific nuclear protein  to visualize neurons and antibodies against the glial fibrillary acidic protein  to visualize astrocytes. essentially, all egfp-positive cells from rats injected with lv-mcmv/syn-egfp were neun-positive, whereas none of them were stained positively for gfap, indicating exclusive neuron specific expression . in contrast, for lv-mcmv/gfaabc1d-egfp injected rats, egfp-positive cells were positively stained with gfap, while in no case was there co-localization of egfp fluoresecence with neun. this confirmed cell-specific expression of egfp that was restricted to glia . thus, we have demonstrated that bidirectional promoter design can be applied successfully to tas to significantly boost the transcriptional activity of two weak cellular promoters without changing their cell-type specificity.

although we used two heterogeneous core promoters other investigators reported that a unidirectional promoter may be bidirectionalized by fusing either a homogeneous or heterogenous minimal core promoter at its 5' end in the opposite orientation  <cit> . apart from cell-specific promoters, which can be made bidirectional as demonstrated in the current study, constitutive and inducible promoters can also be bidirectionalized  <cit> . thus, we believe that the ability to confer bidirectional expression to a promoter is not a special feature of just a few selected promoters. future studies would benefit from applying the bidirectional tas as described in this study to create potent phenotype specific-viral gene expression systems.

few endogenous bidirectional promoters have been described until recently. surprisingly, the human genome survey disclosed a prevalence of bidirectional gene pairs, representing more than 10% of the genes in the genome, whose transcription sites are separated by less than  <dig> base pairs  <cit> . the significance of divergent gene organization is uncertain. takai and jones hypothesized that divergent gene organization might stem from the evolution of the human genome from a more compact genome  <cit> . alternatively, divergently transcribed gene pairs and their bidirectional promoters may act as unique constructs to coordinate gene expression. although the structural and functional implications of the widespread occurrence of bidirectional promoters in the human genome are not fully understood, transcription of these clusters of closely spaced genes may contribute to enhance communication and interplay between promoter elements and transcriptional factors  <cit> . therefore, the synthetic bidirectional promoter design validated in this study may mimic a well-represented and evolutionarily conserved feature of eukaryotic transcription, providing a structural architecture for their robust performance.

CONCLUSIONS
our study presents an updated tas with improved suitability for viral vector-based expression systems. this strategy should be useful for constructing powerful gene expression systems based on other weak cell-specific promoters of larger sizes. we have also constructed avv based on similar expression cassettes and confirmed their improved performance, although these results are not presented in this communication. the lvv based on tas and the bidirectional promoters as constructed in this study will be of value for the exploration of in vivo gene function and future gene therapy applications.
