BACKGROUND
microbial lipase  catalyze hydrolysis of the long chain triglycerides, or the reverse reaction. besides hydrolysis activity, lipases also displayed alcoholysis, aminolysis, interesterification, and esterification activity, etc. with rigorous regioselectivity, stereoselectivity, and chemoselectivity  <cit> . as one kind of non-aqueous enzymes, lipases kept high catalysis efficiency in organic solvent systems or micro-aqueous systems, and were widely used in many industrial fields  <cit> .

microbial strains can produce multiple types of lipases. candida rugosa produced more than five types of lipase isoenzymes , which shared high sequence identity, but displayed significantly different enzymatic characteristics  <cit> . different types of lipases produced by a specific microbial strain always were distributed to different cell compartments, respectively. lipase lipa from pseudomonas aeruginosa either was secreted into the culture medium, or interacted with the polysaccharide alginate and then anchored on the cell surface , while esterase esta from p. aeruginosa was located in the outer membrane  <cit> .

cell-bound lipase could be directly used as a whole cell biocatalyst. compared with the extracellular enzyme, whole cell biocatalysts displayed many advantages, including high stability in the long-term, inexpensive preparation, independence of the exogenous co-factor for redox reaction, etc.  <cit> . in previous research, burkholderia sp. zyb <dig> produced both extracellular lipase and cell-bound lipase  <cit> . the cell-bound lipase from burkholderia cepacia displayed excellent interesterification activity for biodiesel production and highly enantioselective hydrolysis activity for l-menthol synthesis  <cit> . however, there wasn’t any report on the type or the gene sequence of the cell-bound lipase from b. cepacia.

in this article, three predictive cell-bound lipase genes from burkholderia sp. zyb <dig>  lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig>  were cloned and expressed in e. coli, respectively. furthermore, the component of the cell-bound lipase from burkholderia sp. zyb <dig> was analyzed.

nucleotide sequences of the lipa/b, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig> have been deposited in the genbank database under the accession no. eu <dig>  no. kf <dig>  no. kf <dig>  respectively. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the lipa orf, lipc <dig> orf and lipc <dig> orf coded for a putative protein of  <dig> amino acids,  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. protein sequence analysis revealed that the lipa displayed 96 % identity with the known lipase from pseudomonas sp. kwi- <dig>  <cit> , while all homologous protein sequences of lipc <dig> and lipc <dig> were the putative and uncharacterized lipases from the whole genomic dna sequences. moreover, protein sequence alignment through blast did not reveal any sequence identity among lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of lipa cluster, lipc <dig> cluster and lipc <dig> cluster. the amino acid sequences included the putative, uncharacterized lipases showing over 30 % identity to lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc24



expression and enzymatic characterization of lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc24
soluble lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig> could be obtained only when lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig> were co-expressed with their corresponding chaperone genes . the soluble expression of lipa and lipc <dig> required the assistance of the lipase-specific folding gene, lipb. however, co-expression of the chaperone groel-groes gene is the prerequisite for the soluble expression of lipc <dig>  moreover, the soluble expression level of lipc <dig> could be significantly increased when e. coli origami <dig>  was used as the expression host strain .fig.  <dig> map of the expression plasmid for lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig>  a pedsf-lipb- lipa was derived from pacycduet- <dig>  which was inserted lipa gene at the mcs <dig> site and the chaperone lipb gene at the mcs <dig> site; b pedsf-lipc <dig> was derived from pet28a, which was inserted lipc <dig> gene at the mcs site. to obtain the soluble expression of lipc <dig>  plasmid pedsf-lipc <dig> and plasmid pgro <dig> must be co-transformed into e. coli bl21; c pedsf-lipb-lipc <dig> was derived from pacycduet- <dig>  which was inserted lipc <dig> gene at the mcs <dig> site and the chaperone lipb gene at the mcs <dig> site



except for lipc <dig>  both lipa and lipc <dig> displayed lipase activity. as most reports on the enzymatic characterization of the lipa from b. cepacia, the relative molecular weight of the lipa from burkholderia sp. zyb <dig> was 34 kda. lipa was an alkaline mesothermal-active lipase  <cit> . the optimum temperature and ph of lipa for hydrolysis activity were 40 °c and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . the enzymatic characterization of lipc <dig> was totally different from that of lipa. the lipc <dig> was purified  <dig> -fold from the supernatant of the e. coli cell lysate and yielded  <dig>  % of the initial activity. the specific activity of lipc <dig> was  <dig>  u/mg using 4-nitrophenyl palmitate as substrate , which was far lower than that of lipa   <cit> . sds/page analysis of lipc <dig> displayed a single band, which corresponded to a molecular mass of 45 kda . the optimum temperature and ph of lipc <dig> for hydrolysis activity were found to be 40 °c and  <dig> , respectively. the lipc <dig> could be kept stable in the ph range  <dig> - <dig>  for 24 h at 4 °c, while the half-time of the lipc <dig> was only 16 min at 40 °c . lipc <dig> was less stable than lipa. lipa displayed excellent thermostability up to 65 °c and could keep stability over a broad ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  <cit> . the lipc <dig> indicated a clear preference for esters with the medium acyl chain length  when assayed using 4-nitrophenyl derivatives . the lipc <dig> exhibited a simple michaelis-menten kinetics for pnpm hydrolysis. the values of km and vmax of lipc <dig> were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol · min−1 
· mg− <dig>  respectively . michaelis constan km of lipc <dig> is less than that of lipase from bacillus sp.. accordingly, the maximum reaction velocity vmax of lipc <dig> was higher than that of bacillus sp.  <cit> . lipc <dig> cleaved not only the 3-positioned ester bonds, but also the 2-positioned ester bond of triolein . thus, lipc <dig> could nonspecifically hydrolyze the ester bonds of triolein. the same experiment results were verified with other pseudomonas sp. lipases  <cit> .table  <dig> purification of lipc <dig> from e. coli origami 2-pedsf-lipb-lipc24

protein sequence and structural model analysis of lipc24
there were several conserved sequence blocks between the deduced amino acid sequence of lipc <dig> and the other putative homologous lipases. in block  <dig>  there was a conserved pentapeptide gly-tyr-ser-gly-gly, in which the catalytic serine residue was embedded in most lipases. besides the conserved serine residue, there were three conserved aspartate residues in block  <dig>  block  <dig> and block  <dig>  and a conserved histidine residue in block  <dig> . the 3d homology model of lipc <dig> presented the characteristics of a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold, in which parallel or mixed β sheet in the molecular center was surrounded  by helices . a hydrogen bond network was formed among ser <dig>  asp <dig>  and his <dig>  which constituted the catalytic triad . mutant of lipc24-ser179ala lost 100 % lipase activity, which confirmed the function of ser <dig> in the active site. the oxyanion hole consisted of ala <dig> and gly <dig>  which stabilized the transient state of lipc24-ethyl acetate complex . the substrate-binding pocket of lipc <dig> displayed the distinct open y-type structure .fig.  <dig> the 3d model of lipc <dig>  a the overall three-dimensional structure of lipc <dig>  β-strands were represented as arrows and surrounded by the helices; b ser <dig>  asp <dig>  and his <dig> formed the catalytic triad within the range of h-bond interactions; c the transient state model of lipc24-ethyl acetate complex, which was stabilized by ala <dig> and gly <dig>  hip <dig> originated from his <dig>  which accepted a proton from the hydroxyl group of ser179; d the open y-type substrate-binding pocket of lipc24



component of the cell-bound lipase
the cell-bound lipase activity of burkholderis sp. zyb002-Δlipa and burkholderis sp. zyb002-Δlipc <dig> significantly decreased to 58 % and 86 % of its original activity, respectively . the cell-bound lipase activity originated from a multi-enzyme mixture in which lipa was the main component. besides lipa and lipc <dig>  other type of lipases could exist on the cell surface of burkholderis sp. zyb <dig> fig.  <dig> component of the cell-bound lipase from burkholderia sp. zyb <dig>  a comparsion analysis of the cell-bound lipase activity from burkholderis sp. zyb <dig>  burkholderis sp. zyb002-Δlipa, and burkholderis sp. zyb002-Δlipc <dig>   <dig> burkholderis sp. zyb <dig> strain;  <dig> burkholderis sp. zyb002-Δlipa strain;  <dig> burkholderis sp. zyb002-Δlipc <dig> strain. b the predictive lipase gene family and two family viii esterase genes  from b.cepacia j2315



discussion
different types of lipase produced by a specific microbial strain always displayed a totally different 3d structure and enzymatic characterization . in previous research, cell-bound lipase from b. cepacia displayed excellent catalytic activity for organic synthesis  <cit> . however, there was not any report on the gene sequence nor any structural investigation of the cell-bound lipase genes from b. cepacia. from the whole genomic dna sequence of b. cepacia j <dig> , more than  <dig> gene sequences were predicted as lipase genes, including the extracellular lipase lipa  and the chaperone gene lipb . moreover, two predictive lipases, lipc <dig>  and lipc <dig> , were distributed on the cytoplasmic membrane. the genes, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig> were situated on the gene cluster for ammonia metabolism and pilus synthesis, respectively . in p. aeruginosa, part of the extracellular lipase could be anchored on the cell surface and act as cell-bound lipase .

three speculative cell-bound lipase genes  from burkholderia sp. zyb <dig> were cloned and expressed in e. coli. among lipa, lipc <dig> and lipc <dig>  only lipa displayed a high sequence identity with the known extracellular lipase from pseudomonas sp. kwi- <dig>  <cit> , which suggested that lipa was the authentic triacylglycerol lipase. the protein sequences of lipc <dig> and lipc <dig> had not any sequence identity with known lipases or esterases, which could lead to speculations that lipc <dig> and lipc <dig> were the novel lipases .

the expression soluble lipases required different chaperone protein genes. it was necessary for lipa and lipc <dig> to be co-expressed with the lipb gene. due to the strong hydrophobicity, a 70-amino acid residue fragment at the n-terminal of lipb had to be truncated when lipb was heterogeneously co-expressed in e. coli  <cit> . among lipb, groes-groel gene, dnak-dnaj-grpe gene and tig gene, it was only the chaperone groes-groel gene that improved the soluble expression level of lipc <dig>  groel-groes was also reported to be necessary for the soluble expression of the family viii lipase lipbl from marinobacter lipolyticus  <cit> .

enzymatic characterization and 3d structure of lipc <dig> was totally different from that of lipa. lipc <dig> displayed high activity in the neutral buffer  and mesothermal reaction conditions. furthermore, lipc <dig> would sharply abolish the lipolytic activity when lipc <dig> was kept at high temperature, alkaline solution, or acid solution, respectively. on the contrary, lipa was thermostable, alkaline-tolerant, and organic solvent-resistant  <cit> . the open y-type active site of lipc <dig> was totally different from the funnel-shaped active site of lipa  <cit> . in the molecular model of lipc <dig>  a predictive intramolecular disulfide bond was formed between cys <dig> and cys <dig> , which corresponded to the requirement of the host strain, e. coli origami <dig>  for the soluble expression of lipc <dig> 

although both titrimetric assay method and colorimetric assay method were widely used for lipase activity determination, there were obvious differences between the two assay methods  <cit> . olive oil or other triacylglycerol was used as the substrate in the titrimetric assay method, while 4-nitrophenyl esters were always used as the substrate in the colorimetric assay method. however, 4-nitrophenyl esters could be permeated into the cytoplasm , and was hydrolyzed by the intracellular lipolytic enzymes . 4-nitrophenyl esters could not be used as the substrates for activity determination of the cell-bound lipase. in the present work, membrane-impermeable olive oil and the alkali titration assay method was used for the activity determination of the whole cell lipase.

the cell-bound lipase activity of burkholderis sp. zyb002-Δlipa decreased by 42 % of the total cell-bound lipase activity burkholderis sp. zyb <dig> , which demonstrated that lipa was the main component of cell-bound lipases. it had been reported that microbial strains could simultaneously produce extracellular lipases and various kinds of biosurfactants  when various oils or lipids were used as the inducer or carbon source  <cit> . part of biosurfactants were firmly associated with the outer membrane of the host strain and could interact with lipases by electrostatic interaction, which resulted in cell surface anchoring of the extracellular lipases  <cit> . lipc <dig> contributed 14 % of the total cell-bound lipase activity burkholderis sp. zyb <dig> . besides lipa and lipc <dig>  other type of the cell-bound lipases  could exist. further analysis of the whole genome dna sequence of burkholderia cepacia j <dig> predicted several esterase gene sequences, including two novel family viii esterase genes, estviii-c <dig>  and estviii-c <dig>  .

CONCLUSIONS
the cell-bound lipase activity of burkholderia sp. zyb <dig> was shown to be a multi-enzyme mixture, which at least consisted of lipa and lipc <dig>  lipa was the main component of the cell-bound lipase. lipc <dig> was a novel lipase, which displayed a totally different enzymatic characterization and 3d structure to that of lipa. besides lipa and lipc <dig>  other type of the cell-bound lipases  may exist.
