BACKGROUND
alternate splicing of the ctla- <dig> mrna transcript can give rise to at least three mrna species that encode different polypeptides  <cit> . the most well characterized of these is a type i transmembrane protein  expressed on activated t-lymphocytes  <cit> . ctla-4-tm is a co-receptor for the b <dig>   and b <dig>   molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells  <cit> . ctla-4-tm inhibits immune activity in multiple ways. it regulates signaling through the t-cell receptor  <cit> , induces expression of immunoregulatory factors such as tgf-β and icam- <dig>  <cit> , alters the organization of the immunological synapse  <cit> , increases tryptophan catabolism by antigen presenting cells  <cit>  and binds b <dig>  and b <dig>  preventing activation of lymphocytes through the costimulatory lymphocyte receptor cd <dig>  <cit> . another transcript of the ctla- <dig> gene encodes a molecule lacking the transmembrane domain, thus producing a soluble ctla- <dig> polypeptide referred to as sctla- <dig>  <cit> . like ctla-4-tm, sctla- <dig> appears to bind b <dig>  and b <dig> , and may have immunomodulatory properties  <cit> . finally, a variant transcript  <cit>  has been identified in mouse  that encodes a membrane-spanning molecule with an intact cytoplasmic tail, but lacks the extracellular domain. as such, the molecule does not bind the b <dig> family ligands  <cit>  and has been referred to as ligand-independent ctla- <dig> .

the expression of these three ctla- <dig> transcripts and their polypeptide products has been associated with immunoregulatory function, and differences in their expression have been associated with immune-mediated disease. for example, ctla- <dig> knockout mice express none of the possible alternate transcripts and show a profound lymphoproliferative disorder with fatal multiorgan destruction  <cit> . although it is commonly believed that the absence of the ctla-4-tm transcript is solely responsible for the observed immunological disorder in ctla-4-knockout mice, the role of the other transcripts have not been studied as intensively. lictla- <dig> may have immunoregulatory functions, as transfection of it into ctla- <dig> deficient t cells partially corrects the tendency for hyperresonsiveness  <cit> , and the lictla- <dig> transcript has been associated with the development of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in the nod mouse  <cit> . finally, a variety of reports implicate a role for sctla- <dig> in human autoimmune disease. the ct <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism of the ctla- <dig> gene has been associated with autoimmunity and with reduced levels of the sctla- <dig> transcript  <cit> . various studies have demonstrated elevated levels of the sctla- <dig> protein in the blood of patients with a variety of immunologically mediated diseases including autoimmune thyroid disease  <cit> , systemic lupus erythematosis  <cit> , cutaneous systemic sclerosis  <cit> , allergic asthma  <cit> , and psoriasis vulgaris  <cit> . this apparent inverse relationship between levels of sctla- <dig> mrna and circulating levels of the sctla- <dig> protein is not understood.

several years ago, we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  described immunoassays for the detection of sctla- <dig> in human plasma. presumably, such material was the gene product of the sctla- <dig> transcript; however, this was never formally proven. in order to characterize sctla- <dig> in human blood, we performed biochemical analyses of blood-derived molecules that are recognized by multiple ctla-4-specific antibodies. our results suggest that the immunoreactive material in human blood is not the direct product of the sctla- <dig> alternate transcript and has several biochemical features of human immunoglobulin. in addition, ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material from human plasma binds the b <dig>  and b <dig>  proteins, and may have immunomodulatory function.

methods
monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins
the following monoclonal antibodies against ctla- <dig>  were used in these studies: bni <dig> , as <dig> and as <dig> , are monoclonal antibodies that recognize extracellular epitopes in the ctla- <dig> molecule. the mopc-21c antibody  was used as a negative control. elisa assays for ctla- <dig> were done as described previously  <cit> . b <dig> -ig  and b <dig> -ig  fusion proteins  were biotinylated with the use of a commercially available kit . the muc18-ig protein  fusion protein was produced by transfecting cho cells with a commercially available plasmid  encoding a muc18-ig fusion as described  <cit> .

purification of blood-derived sctla-4
plasma samples used in these studies were obtained from humans undergoing therapeutic plasmapheresis for myasthenia gravis. documented informed consent was obtained for each of the subjects enrolled in this study. this study was performed under the oversight of the institutional review board of aurora health care . plasma was frozen at -20°c until use.  <dig> mls of plasma were diluted with  <dig> mm tris-hcl in water until the ph of the solution reached  <dig> . typically this required a mixture  <dig> volume of plasma to  <dig> volumes of  <dig> mm tris-hcl. this mixture was then passed through a column containing  <dig> mls of q sepharose . flow through was collected and solid ammonium sulfate was added to create a 45% saturated solution. after overnight incubation at 4°c, precipitate was collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> minutes. the pelleted material was resuspended in  <dig> mls of phosphate buffered saline  and dialyzed using a  <dig> kda molecular weight dialysis tubing in pbs with  <dig> buffer exchanges. this material was passed over a  <dig> ml column, linked to the mopc- <dig> monoclonal antibody using the pierce aminolink plus immobilization kit, and flow through was then passed over a column containing the antibody as <dig>  material was eluted from the as <dig> column using elution buffer  and collected in  <dig> ml fractions.

blood-derived sctla- <dig> binding to b <dig> -ig and b <dig> -ig
 <dig> well elisa plates were coated with  <dig> ul of fractions collected from the as <dig> column overnight at 4°c. after coating, plates were washed and incubated with  <dig> μl block solution  for  <dig> hour at room temperature to block nonspecific protein binding sites. blocked wells were incubated with the biotinylated proteins b <dig> -ig, b <dig> -ig, muc18-ig, or as <dig> at room temperature for  <dig> hour. next, wells were washed, incubated with streptavidin hrp  for  <dig> minutes and washed again. tmb  was added to the wells, the hrp reaction proceeded for approximately  <dig> minutes, was stopped by addition of 1n h2so <dig>  and absorbance was read during illumination with light at  <dig> nm.

protein a binding of sctla-4
recombinant sctla- <dig>  produced as described  <cit> , or plasma diluted 1: <dig> with  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig>  , was passed over a column containing  <dig> ml of protein a sepharose . flow through was collected in  <dig> ml fractions.  <dig> mls of tbs was passed over the column to wash unbound material and was collected in  <dig> ml fractions. bound material was eluted from the column in  <dig> mm glycine ph  <dig>  collected in  <dig> ml fractions and neutralized with  <dig> ul of 10xtbs. pre-column, flow through, wash, and eluted fractions were tested in elisa for the presence of sctla- <dig> 

gel filtration
 <dig>  mls of serum was diluted with  <dig>  mls of pbs containing recombinant sctla- <dig>  and passed through a column  containing approximately  <dig> ml of sephacryl s <dig> . the first  <dig> mls were discarded and then  <dig> ml fractions were collected by hand. each fraction was tested for the presence of blood-derived sctla- <dig> or recombinant sctla- <dig> using elisa assays.

protein identification
identification of proteins from 1d-sds page was performed by proteomic research services . proteins that eluted from the as <dig> column were precipitated in 70% ethanol and pelleted by centrifugation  <dig>  rpm in a microcentrifuge for  <dig> minutes. the pellet was dissolved at room temperature in 5% sds,  <dig> m urea,  <dig> mm tris buffer , and 10% 2-mercapto ethanol, and separated using nupage 12% bis-tris sds page gels in mes running buffer  and visualized by staining gels with coomassie blue. proteins were reduced, alykylated and trypsin digested in isolated gel fragments, and were identified using lc/ms/ms.

protein identification by 2d-dige was performed by applied biomics . purified proteins were labeled with either cy <dig> or cy <dig>  the first dimension separation consisted of isoelectric focusing over ph 3- <dig>  the second dimension separation was carried out using 8-14% gradient sds-page. differentially expressed proteins were cut out and digested with trypsin before analysis with mass spectroscopy.

RESULTS
the ctla-4-specific monoclonal antibodyas <dig> isolates b7-binding proteins from blood
in order to provide a more detailed biochemical characterization of sctla- <dig> from human plasma, we used the purification scheme depicted in figure  <dig> with specific details given in the methods section. the purification scheme required large quantities of human plasma. therefore, we collected discarded plasma from patients receiving plasmapheresis as part of a therapy to treat myasthenia gravis. this provided a safe means of obtaining large volumes of plasma from humans. we collected samples from three patients that tested positive in ctla- <dig> elisa assays and one patient that tested negative. the plasma was used to perform biochemical analyses of ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material and no relationship to disease was studied.

eluted material was collected in fractions and tested in sandwich elisa assays for ctla- <dig> epitopes and for functional activity in a b <dig> binding assay. figure  <dig> shows the results of experiments from three distinct plasma samples. peak reactivity with ctla- <dig> specific antibodies correlates with binding to the b <dig>  protein. the specificity of the binding to b <dig>  was verified when the isolated material did not bind to an irrelevant fusion protein . similar results were also obtained with the b <dig> -ig fusion protein , demonstrating that material eluted from anti-ctla- <dig> affinity columns binds to ctla- <dig> ligands. when the plasma samples lacking ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material were subjected to an identical affinity purification procedure, eluted material displayed minimal reactivity in ctla- <dig> elisa and did not bind either b <dig>  or b <dig>  .

identification of proteins enriched by an as <dig> column
proteins eluted from anti-ctla- <dig> affinity columns, were separated by one-dimensional sds-page and visualized with coomassie blue staining. figure  <dig> shows a representative experiment comparing proteins isolated from plasma that either lacked or contained anti-ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material. the ~  <dig> kda band marked by a box is enriched in anti-ctla- <dig> reactive samples from  <dig> different donors  compared to the anti-ctla- <dig> negative sample. proteins in the highlighted gel fragment were identified by lc/ms/ms and are listed in table  <dig>  protein sequencing was performed on material isolated from  <dig> different positive donors. a light chain from a hepatitis b specific antibody was the only protein common to both samples.

recombinant sctla- <dig> and anti-ctla- <dig> affinity-purified material from human plasma differentially bind protein a and have different molecular masses
in an effort to remove contaminating immunoglobulin from the molecules recognized by anti-ctla- <dig> antibodies, we passed plasma through columns linked to protein a. unexpectedly, ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material from plasma bound to the protein a column and was only released at low ph . in comparison, recombinant sctla- <dig> that passed over protein a columns was present in flow- through and in the neutral ph column wash solution, but it did not elute at low ph . this indicates that the ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material in blood exhibits immunoglobulin like properties in contrast to recombinant sctla- <dig> 

in addition, the finding that a ctla-4-specific affinity column enriched a  <dig> kda plasma protein  was surprising given the primary sequence of sctla- <dig> predicts its mass to be  <dig> kda. in an effort to determine the molecular mass of ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material by a second method, we performed gel filtration on serum and tested fractions in elisa assays using ctla- <dig> specific antibodies. human igg served as an internal size standard. blood-derived ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material co-eluted with the bulk of igg indicating that it has a molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kd . this result was repeated in samples obtained from  <dig> other donors whose blood reacts with ctla- <dig> specific antibodies .

for comparison, serum from a donor lacking molecules recognized by ctla- <dig> specific antibodies was spiked with recombinant sctla- <dig> and then passed over a sizing column. recombinant sctla- <dig> clearly eluted from the column after igg . the minimal overlap of the igg fractions with fractions containing recombinant sctla- <dig> demonstrates that recombinant sctla- <dig> is smaller than  <dig> kd.

2d gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy of proteins enriched on an anti-ctla- <dig> affinity column
because molecules purified by anti-ctla- <dig> affinity chromatography exhibit biochemical properties similar to human igg, we attempted to separate this material from igg using  <dig> dimensional gel electrophoresis that separates molecules on the basis of isoelectric point and size. for comparison, molecules that bound to a column containing an immobilized irrelevant antibody , and molecules bound to the as <dig> column, were labeled with different color fluorescent molecules and separated on the same gel. the fluorescent dyes allowed identification of proteins that were enriched by the as <dig> column.  <dig> spots, which were at least 2-fold more abundant in the as <dig> eluted material versus the mopc material, were analyzed by mass spectroscopy, and their identity is shown in table  <dig>  there were no common proteins identified in this analysis when compared to mass spectroscopy performed on bands identified on sds-page gels . interestingly, we found another light chain from an antibody specific for hepatitis b surface antigen. the anti-hepatitis b surface antigen light chains identified by the  <dig> dimensional and  <dig> dimensional protocols are distinct light chains as they only share 30% sequence similarity .

plasma proteins that preferentially bound a to the ctla <dig> specific antibody as <dig> compared to the irrelevant control antibody mopc were identified by 2d-dige. spots were picked and identified by maldi spectroscopy.

discussion
our biochemical analyses demonstrate that the molecules in human blood that are recognized by anti-ctla- <dig> antibodies are not a simple product of the sctla- <dig> alternate transcript. we previously described sctla- <dig> immunoreactive material in blood plasma from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease  <cit> . in that study, western blotting of material from immunoprecipitates, using a pool of commercially available monoclonal antibodies to ctla- <dig>  identified proteins with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda consistent with the size of recombinant sctla- <dig>  we also noted the observation of larger material  in those immunopreciptates but did not characterize this species further. the ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material described in this communication may be the larger molecules noted in our previous studies.

this study identifies material that reacts with multiple anti-ctla- <dig> antibodies and with known ligands of ctla- <dig>  b <dig>   and b <dig>  . additionally, its molecular size is approximately  <dig> kda, it binds protein a with high affinity, and when analyzed by mass spectroscopy, we find human antibodies. despite the fact that the molecules studied exhibit characteristics of ctla-4-ig fusion proteins, none of our plasma donors received exogenous ctla-4-ig  as a therapy. therefore the isolated molecules are endogenous to our plasma donors.

though we did not conclusively identify these molecules, we found  <dig> separate light chains that originated from human immunoglobulins specific for hepatitis b surface antigen . one of the hepatitis b specific light chains was found in  <dig> different subjects, and both light chains were isolated from a single donor. while it is possible that we have identified an idiotype network involving epitopes on the hepatitis b surface antigen, ctla- <dig>  and some immunoglobulins, comparing the sequences with the bl2seq program on the ncbi website  did not reveal any obvious sequence homology among these molecules. a more detailed structural analysis is warranted.

perhaps most importantly, our findings highlight the fact that the sctla- <dig> measured in human plasma by studies of autoimmune disease does not represent a simple gene product of the sctla- <dig> transcript. though the isolated material was recognized by several ctla- <dig> specific antibodies and interacted with b <dig>  and b <dig>  proteins, mass spectroscopy analysis found no evidence of the ctla- <dig> protein in the isolated material. it is possible that ctla- <dig> protein escaped our mass spectroscopy analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  only a  <dig> kda protein was more abundant in samples that are positive by ctla- <dig> elisa than in the negative sample. sctla- <dig>  having a mass of  <dig> kda, may be present in the very abundant band at approximately  <dig> kda, but there was no evidence that this band was enriched during our isolation procedure. because of the abundant material at ~  <dig> kda and ~  <dig> kda in both the positive and negative samples we realized it was possible that less abundant proteins may be obscured if they comigrated with more abundant proteins. therefore, we chose to analyze the samples by 2d-dige in an effort to resolve sctla- <dig> from contaminating abundant proteins. computer analysis identified the proteins most highly enriched by the ctla- <dig> specific affinity column, and again sctla- <dig> was not found even when proteins of approximately  <dig> kda were analyzed .

our gel filtration and protein a binding data suggest that if sctla- <dig> exists in the blood samples we analyzed, it appears to be complexed with immunoglobulin. another possibility is that blood contains protein, either immunoglobulins or a novel protein associated with immunoglobulins, that interact with the ligands of ctla- <dig> and with ctla- <dig> specific antibodies.

we believe the presence of ctla- <dig> immunoreactivity in plasma is not likely due to heterophile antibodies that are known to interfere with two site immunoassays  <cit> . the samples selected for analysis in these studies were screened to be negative for binding to irrelevant mouse igg. furthermore, the muc-ig negative control used in the b <dig> binding assays contained the identical ig fusion partner as the b7-ig proteins. finally, if present, heterophile antibodies should have been removed by the mopc column during the isolation procedure.

our findings may reconcile the apparent discrepancy between reports of elevated levels of sctla- <dig> in plasma from patients with autoimmune disease and the report of decreased levels of the sctla- <dig> transcript among individuals with the ct <dig> allele of the ctla- <dig> gene. ct <dig> is a single nucleotide polymorphism within the ctla- <dig> locus  <cit>  and the "g" allele is associated with both susceptibility to type  <dig> diabetes and low levels of the sctla- <dig> transcript. because sctla- <dig> in blood is probably not the direct product of the sctla- <dig> transcript, the lack of correlation between transcript and plasma protein, is not surprising. in addition, immunoassays designed to measure sctla- <dig> levels may not reliably quantify blood-derived sctla- <dig> because of its uncertain identity. in this regard, it is important to interpret reports of sctla- <dig> levels with caution, and to re-examine the possible relationship of circulating ctla- <dig> levels and human disease. to this point, we have recently reported a lack of association between levels of sctla- <dig> protein in blood and several of the common polymorphisms that show population genetic associations with a variety of autoimmune disease  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
molecules from human blood that have been labeled sctla- <dig> are not simply a direct product of an alternatively spliced transcript of the ctla- <dig> gene. these molecules exhibit properties of ctla- <dig> and of immunoglobulins. though some studies have found a correlation between circulating levels of the putative sctla- <dig> molecule and the presence of autoimmunity, this relationship is poorly understood. this study improves understanding of the biochemical nature of what has been called sctla- <dig> and will help subsequent analyses to elucidate the role of this molecule in autoimmune disorders.
