BACKGROUND
over the last decade, microarray technology has allowed researchers to measure gene expression levels across large numbers of genes simultaneously, identifying genes and biological processes that are activated or suppressed under different conditions. potential biomarkers  <cit>  and genes involved in a number of diseases, such as cancer, have been identified by microarray analyses  <cit> . by combining gene expression data in a meta-analysis, greater power and more information can be gained from existing data. meta-analyses have been successfully used to identify new relationships between genes and new candidate disease-associated genes  <cit> . microarrays provide large-scale, genome-wide data, from which coordinated changes in gene expression can be inferred. these coordinated changes are valuable in understanding the factors involved in disease and the functions of many poorly studied genes. one of the issues that arises with these large-scale datasets, however, is that it becomes harder to interpret the data and identify key players. for this reason we created a tool to facilitate this process: genefriends.

genefriends is based on a co-expression analysis, in which the general behaviour of genes relative to each other is studied. this makes it possible to uncover genetic modules that are functionally related  <cit> , under the assumption that those genes active in the same biological processes are co-expressed. the main theory behind this approach is that functionally related genes are more likely to be co-expressed  <cit> . this “guilt-by-association” concept has already been used to relate hundreds of unidentified genes to inflammation, steroid-synthesis, insulin-synthesis, neurotransmitter processing, matrix remodelling and other processes  <cit> . some of the predicted results have been experimentally validated demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach  <cit> . candidate genes for cancer, parkinson’s and schizophrenia have also been identified using this approach  <cit> . furthermore, it is possible to identify transcriptional modules that may play causative roles in the disease or process under study  <cit> .

the aim of this work was to construct an online tool that can be used to derive novel candidate genes for further studies in aging and complex diseases, in a quick and intuitive manner. aging is not considered a disease, yet older individuals are more susceptible to several diseases such as alzheimer’s, parkinson’s and cancer. this is one of the reasons why research in this field is rapidly expanding and several hundreds of genes have been linked to aging  <cit> . a major bottleneck in aging/complex disease research is that it is difficult to determine the causality of transcriptional alterations. it is also unclear if the altered expression profile observed with aging/complex disease consists of one particular biological module or whether it consists of genes that act separately from each other. to this end, genefriends outputs transcription factors co-expressed with the genes supplied by the user.

underlying genefriends is a genome-wide co-expression map created using over  <dig>  mouse microarray datasets. we validated our co-expression map by showing that functionally related genes are more likely to be co-expressed. we then used genefriends to study transcriptional changes with aging, cancer and mitochondrial disease. multiple candidate genes associated with cancer and mitochondrial diseases, including un-annotated and poorly studied genes, were identified. two of the novel candidates of unknown function that were co-expressed with cancer-associated genes were experimentally validated by knock-down in hela cells which slowed growth, supporting our predictions. this demonstrates that genefriends is a useful resource for studying complex diseases/processes and can infer function of poorly studied genes. genefriends is freely available online to allow researchers to quickly identify candidate genes co-expressed with their genes of interest .

RESULTS
genefriends: an online tool for the research community
the aim of the project was to create a user-friendly tool, which can take a list of genes related to a given disease or process and quickly identify new candidate genes. using co-expression profiling the genes are given in rank order to help prioritize candidates for experimental follow up. underlying genefriends is a mus musculus co-expression map created from  <dig>  microarray datasets, comprising over  <dig>  individual samples from previously published experiments. to create the co-expression map we employed a vote counting method. the co-expression map contains ≈  <dig>  million gene pairs  arranged in a matrix and given a score based on how often they are co-expressed across all microarrays .

the input for genefriends is either a single gene or a list of entrez or gene symbol identifiers. the output is a simple, clear list of co-expressed genes, which can be downloaded or viewed online. genefriends has the following functionalities:

 <dig>  it searches for co-expressed genes based on a seed list or a single gene, and provides a ranked list of significantly co-expressed genes.

 <dig>  it identifies the gene ontology  terms and enrichment for the significantly co-expressed genes.

 <dig>  it returns a ranked list of significantly co-expressed transcription factors.

we feel this output will help researchers in various fields identify interesting genes for follow up studies in a quick and intuitive manner. to test if this novel tool can be used to derive biologically-relevant predictions we tested gene sets related to aging, cancer or mitochondrial complex i disease. furthermore, we tested two predicted novel candidates experimentally, as detailed below.

testing the co-expression map
the biological significance of the co-expression map was verified using nine genes known to be involved in three biological processes: cell division cycle, immune response and fatty acid metabolism. the top 5% of genes identified by genefriends as co-expressed were analysed by david  <cit>  to detect enriched biological processes and functions. the results confirmed that genes co-expressed were functionally related to either cell cycle , immune response  or fatty acid metabolism ; detailed results are included in the supplementary data . furthermore, figure  <dig> shows the clustering of the co-expression map’s network, demonstrating that co-expressed genes tend to be involved in the same biological processes. 

genefriends uses a vote-counting method to rank co-expression. we compared genefriends to coxpressdb  <cit> , which utilizes the more commonly used correlation value . to do so we selected  <dig> genes with known functions and retrieved output from both tools and used david to determine enriched categories. the results show similar categories and scores although the overlap in the specific genes can vary . when comparing the numbers of transcription factors present in the top  <dig> co-expressed genes from genefriends and coxpressdb the results are similar. this demonstrates that our approach is similar to using pearson correlation to create a co-expression map.

candidate gene prediction from process/disease gene lists
we used genefriends to identify novel candidate genes associated with specific processes or diseases. the results show the numbers of times each of the  <dig>  genes in the co-expression map were "friends" with genes in the disease gene seed and corresponding p-values indicate the statistical significance of the co-expression . the p-value is calculated based on the number of seed genes a given gene is co-expressed with and the total number of genes it is co-expressed with . david was used to interpret the broader biological significance of the results. all genes with a co-expression p-value <10- <dig> were classified using the default settings in david. this is a stringent cut-off since using a bonferroni correction for multiple testing results in:  <dig> / <dig>  >  <dig> -6

aging-related gene prediction and putative transcriptional mechanisms
genefriends was used to identify genes related to aging. a seed list of genes known to be consistently over-expressed with age in mammals was used  <cit> . in total,  <dig> genes were co-expressed with the aging seed list at p <10-6; table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> genes. many of these genes have been associated with age-related diseases. several other genes that have been shown to play a role in aging such as lysosomal-associated membrane protein- <dig> lamp <dig>  <cit>  , fas  <cit>   and growth hormone receptor ghr  <cit>   also showed a significant co-expression. anxa <dig>  anxa <dig> and anxa <dig> also show a low p-value  as well as several s <dig> calcium binding proteins which have been shown to interact with annexins  <cit> .

the most significantly over-represented functional clusters were inflammatory response  =  <dig> , fdr =  <dig> x10-18), vasculature development  and lysosome . since most of the genes in the seed list were classified in the categories related to the immune system, it was unsurprising to find similar results for the co-expressed genes.

eighty genes from the initial  <dig> genes in the aging seed list showed a co-expression p-value <10- <dig>  suggesting the presence of shared transcriptional modules. in order to investigate the underlying transcriptional mechanisms that may induce this expression profile we used the co-expressed transcription factor  results from genefriends. table  <dig> shows the  <dig> most significantly co-expressed tfs with aging. the most significant tfs identified were c/ebpα, c/ebpβ and c/ebpδ . interestingly, these tfs show co-expression  with a significant proportion of the genes co-expressed with the aging seed list:  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  for all  <dig> tfs and  <dig> out of  <dig>  were co-expressed with at least  <dig> out of  <dig> c/epβ genes.

since these tfs are co-expressed with the aging-related genes it was expected that these genes, at least in part, would be regulated by the co-expressed tfs. therefore, they would share transcription factor binding sites  for these tfs. to identify over-represented binding motifs in the genes co-expressed with the aging genes  we employed factory  <cit> . for the aging gene set this revealed nfkb as the most significant result . some of the tfbs identified have co-expressed genes with the aging seed list such as nfkb <dig> , the c/ebp  genes and irf <dig>  genes . however, tfbs for isre, nfkb <dig>  and sp <dig> were identified as over-represented but not co-expressed and many co-expressed tfs did not have over-represented binding sites.

cancer-related gene prediction
a list of  <dig> cancer-related genes was used as seed list for genefriends . david analysis identified cell cycle  and dna replication/repair  as the most significant over-represented categories for cancer-related co-expressed genes. this is expected given the fact that cancer arises from the uncontrolled division of cells. table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> co-expressed genes.

from the original seed list only  <dig> genes pass the p <10- <dig> threshold co-expressed with the entire set of cancer genes, which could be due to the heterogeneity of cancer etiology. however, there were several significantly co-expressed genes, not included in the seed list, that have previously been associated with cancer. for example, cdc25a, cdc25b and cdc25c, members of the cdc <dig> family, are significantly co-expressed  with the cancer-related genes.

there were a high number of significantly co-expressed centromeric proteins co-expressed with the cancer seed list. these proteins play a role in chromosome segregation and incorrect segregation of chromosomes during the cell cycle can lead to cancer  <cit> . cep <dig> is involved in centriole duplication  <cit> . cenpp, as well as cenpn/f/h/j/i/c1/t/k/m/e/q/a/l, are all co-expressed significantly with the cancer seed list  and are part of the cenp-a nac complex. this complex is required for proper kinetochore function and mitotic progression and its disruption can lead to incorrect chromosome alignment and segregation that preclude cell survival despite continued centromere-derived mitotic checkpoint signalling  <cit> . plk <dig>  aurka, aurkb and cdca <dig> are in the top  <dig> co-expressed genes, these play an important role in cancer formation  <cit> .

several un-annotated genes  were co-expressed with the cancer-related genes, suggesting these genes might play a role in occurrence or pathophysiology of cancer. one of these un-annotated genes, bc <dig>  is a predicted protein coding gene, which has a high co-expression ratio of more than  <dig>  with the cancer genes rad <dig> and ccdc <dig>  <cit> , indicating this gene is increased in expression in >70% of the cases when rad <dig> is increased in expression. many other cancer-related genes such as brca <dig> and brca <dig> also show a strong co-expression with the bc <dig> gene . all genes co-expressed with bc <dig> show enrichment for the cell cycle . a blast analysis of the protein sequence shows no significant homology to other mus musculus proteins. similar sequences, however, are found in a large number of different multi-cellular species such as gallus gallus, bos taurus and homo sapiens and there also is a significantly similar gene present in arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting it is conserved in plants as well, indicating it plays a functional role.

validating the role of c1orf <dig> and c12orf <dig> in growth of cancer cells
to test our predictions, we employed sirnas to knock down the human homologs of bc <dig>  and 4930547n16rik  in the widely-used hela cancer cell line. these two genes were selected for validation because they are co-expressed with genes involved in the cell cycle , so knockdown should lead to a measurable phenotype. furthermore, validated sirnas are available  for these genes. the results show that the growth rate of the cancer cells is significantly lower when either c1orf <dig> or c12orf <dig> are knocked down . these results support our predictions and demonstrate that c1orf <dig> and c12orf <dig> are functional.

mitochondrial complex i disease-related gene prediction
all  <dig> genes in the seed list of mitochondrial complex i disease genes were significantly co-expressed with each other. this was the strongest co-expression amongst all disease gene seed lists tested, indicating they are involved in the same process and are tightly regulated . table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> co-expressed genes with the seed list. the results included a number of genes that have been associated with several diseases amongst which alzheimer’s and parkinson’s disease. not surprisingly, david analysis identified, mitochondrion , cellular respiration  and oxidoreductase activity, acting on nadh , as the most significant functional clusters.

the co-expressed genes include several mitochondrial complex i genes , multiple cytochrome c proteins and genes involved in the atp synthase complex. furthermore, there are approximately  <dig> poorly/un-annotated genes co-expressed. a pseudo gene, 3000002c10rik, shows a co-expression ratio of > <dig>  with  <dig> genes. classification of these  <dig> genes using david results in an enrichment score of  <dig>   for mitochondrial genes. therefore, 3000002c10rik may play a biologically relevant role in mitochondrial processes.

predicting functions of un-annotated genes
to investigate if it is possible to predict or estimate a given gene’s function based on its co-expression pattern we inspected a selection of un-annotated genes. using david, the functional categories for the top 5% co-expressed genes were obtained. table  <dig> shows the functional categories for the un-annotated genes with the highest significance value. while some of the categories identified are broad, others are more specific. together with the results for c1orf <dig> or c12orf <dig>  these results show that it is possible to use genefriends to infer gene function.

clusters from david with an enrichment score  above  <dig> are displayed . cluster titles and fdr were selected based on the most significant annotation within the cluster. for full lists refer to additional file  <dig> 

discussion
genefriends: a genetics and genomics tool for the research community
genefriends is freely available online  and is an intuitive tool, which can be used to identify the genes co-expressed from a user supplied gene list. this simple, yet powerful new tool can be a valuable resource for genome interpretation, annotation, mouse genetics, functional genomics and transcriptional regulation. it may also be useful to develop network analyses of mouse genes in a variety of studies.

we tested genefriends to determine whether it can give biologically relevant data. we also demonstrated how genefriends can be used to quickly identify interesting gene targets for follow up studies. furthermore, we experimentally validated two un-annotated genes co-expressed with a cancer seed list. below we discuss the findings we have obtained from our example analyses and the biological relevance of our results.

validation of the co-expression map
the main assumption made when constructing our mouse co-expression map is that co-expressed genes tend to be involved in the same biological processes. our results clearly support this, showing that genes known to play a role in certain biological processes such as immune system, cell cycle and lipid metabolism are co-expressed and form clusters in the co-expression network . different clusters show different strengths of co-expression, therefore the effectiveness of the gene set analyses may vary. however, there is a high degree of functional coherence between co-expressed genes showing that our co-expression map can be used to obtain biologically-relevant information.

given the intrinsic noisy nature of microarray data, we used a vote counting approach, which is a standard meta-analysis technique, to build our co-expression map  <cit> . the aim of this approach is to emphasize sensitivity. this is particularly important when combining large and diverse datasets and has been shown to increase sensitivity when studying aging, for example  <cit> . from a technical point of view, we aimed to include as much data as possible and because of the technical implications accompanied by this the vote counting method is more efficient and has faster run times than other methods.

co-expression analysis of genes associated with aging
using a guilt-by-association method we identified candidate genes related to seed lists of genes associated with diseases or processes. our study not only identified genes relevant to current theories of aging, e.g. inflammation, but it also identified novel candidates for further research. c/ebp transcription factors showed the strongest co-expression and are therefore candidate activators of the altered expression patterns with age. tfbs for c/ebp genes were identified in the aging genes and there is some evidence of a transcriptional cascade via sp <dig>  <cit> . the two proteins encoded by the c/ebpβ gene are liver activating protein  and liver inhibiting protein, which have opposing effects  <cit> . the lip protein is also capable of inhibiting other c/ebp proteins. this could explain why c/ebp transcription factors themselves are not found to be increased/decreased in expression with age. this could also be due to the fact that tfs are sometimes expressed at low levels not detected by microarrays.

replacement of the c/ebpα gene with c/ebpβ increases lifespan by 20%  <cit> , and may alter the rate of aging  <cit> , indicating that altering the isoform expression of these genes can affect lifespan. moreover, the life-extending drug rapamycin may affect isoform ratios of c/ebpβ. rapamycin has been shown to increase lifespan via the suppression of mtor  <cit>  which in turn controls the isoform ratios of c/ebpβ  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that rapamycin may in part exert its life extending effect through c/ebpβ.

co-expression analysis of cancer genes and experimental validation of candidates
we used genefriends to identify new candidate genes for a role in cancer. many of the cancer genes in the initial seed list were not present in the results, indicating they are not co-expressed with each other. this may be due to the fact that this set of cancer genes includes both oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes which are not expected to be co-expressed. also cancer can arise through different mechanisms. therefore the genes identified as co-expressed in this study are likely involved in common pathways leading to cancer, or are at least triggered by transformation.

genes that are co-expressed with several oncogenes may prove to be useful targets in countering the proliferating effect of these genes in tumours. examples of such genes that are already being studied are cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> genes, both of which were identified as co-expressed in our study. cdc <dig> has been suggested as a therapeutic cancer target and on-going studies in this direction have shown some level of success  <cit> . two compounds that target cdc <dig> are currently in phase i clinical trials  <cit> . the fact that candidate genes identified by our method have already been suggested as potential drug targets shows that genefriends can be useful for the identification of candidate targets for cancer studies.

bc <dig> is one of the poorly annotated genes that is strongly co-expressed with a large number of cancer genes. knock-down of the human homolog, c1orf <dig>  in hela cells diminishes cell growth, which adding the fact that bc <dig> knockout mice are not viable  <cit>  , demonstrates that this gene is functional. further studies of this gene in the context of cell cycle regulation, development and cancer are warranted. these results show that genefriends can indeed be used to identify novel targets for particular diseases. in addition it confirms that the functional enrichment of co-expressed genes can give indications about an un-annotated gene's function. the other un-annotated gene co-expressed with cancer we tested was 4930547nrik . c12orf <dig> was recently shown to be over-expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells  <cit>  and in other aggressive and therapy-resistant malignancies  <cit> . in line with our findings in hela cells, knock down of c12orf <dig> significantly suppressed pdac cell growth  <cit> .

co-expression analysis of mitochondrial i complex disease genes
mitochondrial complex i diseases include isolated complex i deficiency, which is the most common enzymatic defect of the oxidative phosphorylation disorders and can cause a wide range of clinical disorders  <cit> . these include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, nonspecific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, leigh syndrome, leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of parkinson’s disease  <cit> . mutations in the nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes have been associated with several pathologies  <cit> . however, half of the patients with mitochondrial complex i  deficiencies lack mutations in any known ci subunit suggesting that yet unidentified genes crucial for maturation, assembly, or stability of ci may be involved in these diseases  <cit> . we identified several un-annotated genes that show a strong co-expression with the mitochondrial disease gene set. as most of the other co-expressed genes encode mitochondrial proteins, these un-annotated genes most likely also encode mitochondrial proteins. this is further supported by the fact that a number of these un-annotated genes have been shown to be active in the mitochondria in another large-scale study  <cit> . some of these genes could be responsible for the ci deficiency phenotype and are therefore promising candidates for further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we created a tool that identifies co-expressed genes from a user’s seed list. moreover, it returns the go term enrichment of this list as well as a separate list of the co-expressed transcription factors. this allows novel candidate genes to be quickly identified for follow up studies. genefriends employs a biologically-relevant co-expression map and a guilt-by-association method to identify novel candidate genes for complex diseases/processes. we demonstrated the biological relevance of this tool by analysing aging, cancer and mitochondrial i complex deficiency seed lists. furthermore, we experimentally validated two un-annotated candidate genes co-expressed with cancer-related genes. we also demonstrated how genefriends can be used to investigate transcription factors that are co-expressed with seed genes of interest, helping to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms. genefriends is freely available online  for other researchers to identify and prioritize candidate genes to study other complex diseases and processes.
