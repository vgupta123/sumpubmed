BACKGROUND
dyt <dig> dystonia is a neurological disease characterized by prolonged, involuntary movements that develop in childhood or early adolescence, and occur in the absence of cns pathology  <cit> . the disease is caused by an in-frame, loss-of-function mutation that removes a glutamic acid residue  from tora  <cit> . tora is a member of the aaa+ atpase family  that typically couple the energy released by atp hydrolysis to conformational changes in binding partners. the structural changes induced by aaa+ proteins vary. however, in most cases, an oligomeric ring arrangement of aaa+ enzyme subunits pulls the binding-partner substrate into the central pore and, by doing so, 'stretches' or removes secondary structure from the substrate. this action often destabilizes an otherwise energetically favorable binding interaction, such as the presence of substrate in a protein complex, aggregate, or association with a lipid bilayer. there are many hundreds of aaa+ enzymes and substrates, and aaa+ enzymes are used in processes as diverse as dna replication, membrane fusion, protein degradation and cytoskeletal movement  <cit> .

multiple studies and research groups have found that tora is an endoplasmic reticulum  resident protein  <cit> . however, despite localization throughout the er-system, tora loss specifically affects the ne subdomain and this suggests that tora aaa+ activity is targeted to a ne localized protein  <cit> . it is well established that tora interacts with the inner nuclear membrane protein, lamina-associated-polypeptide- <dig>   <cit> . the importance of lap <dig> is further underscored by the recent finding that lap <dig> loss causes similar ne abnormalities to those seen in tora null cells  <cit> . in addition, the interaction between tora and lap <dig> is stabilized by aaa+ domain mutations that typically inhibit atp hydrolysis, such as the walkerb box e171q mutation in human tora  <cit> . since the majority of aaa+ proteins interact with substrate in their atp bound form, this stabilization suggests that lap <dig> is a tora substrate. to date, however, the cellular functions of lap <dig> remain unknown, no other luminal binding partners are identified, and lap <dig> levels and subcellular localization appear unaffected by tora loss  <cit>  - a surprising state of affairs for the predicted substrate of a physiologically important aaa+ protein. other tora binding partners are also described, including the nesprin proteins that are components of the linc complex that couples the nuclear interior to cytoskeletal networks  <cit> . however, the relationship between these reported interacting partners, and the biochemical  <cit> , genetic  <cit>  and cell biologically  <cit>  verified association between tora and lap <dig> remains unclear.

genetic analysis has demonstrated that the disease-associated tora-Δe protein is expressed in dyt <dig> dystonia, but is hypoactive or inactive  <cit> . consistent with these findings, recent studies demonstrated that Δe appears to inhibit tora interaction with lap <dig> and the homologous lull <dig> membrane protein  <cit> . however, tora-Δe can also concentrate in the ne  <cit> , which suggests that Δe stabilizes, rather than inhibits, interaction with an ne binding partner. the possibility that tora-Δe displays enhanced ne-localized binding also argues against dyt <dig> dystonia being caused by a pure loss-of-function mutation. furthermore, a gain-of-function activity is also consistent with the dominant nature of disease inheritance and that the tora-Δe generating mutation is the sole causative mutation. here we further examined tora-Δe behavior in order to determine whether dysfunction of the mutant disease protein might contribute to dyt <dig> dystonia pathogenesis. we describe an association between tora-Δe and the sun <dig> inner nuclear membrane protein, and present data suggesting that sun <dig> is also a normal tora binding partner. this abnormal ability of tora-Δe provides more evidence for a gain-of-function action in dyt <dig> dystonia, and implicates the neurodevelopmentally important linc complex dysfunction in disease pathogenesis.

RESULTS
the majority of ne membrane proteins are localized and immobilized in this er subdomain by binding to the nuclear lamina  <cit> . although tora is a luminal protein, tora-e171q and tora-Δe concentrate in the ne of several cell lines, and each diffuses more slowly than er-localized tora  <cit> , which suggests that both isoforms interact with a lamina-associated ne membrane protein, such as lap <dig>  we examined the lap1-binding of human tora-Δe and tora-e171q using mouse nih-3t <dig> cells where both isoforms similarly localize in the ne , whereas this is previously assessed using cell lines where tora-Δe is predominantly er-localized  <cit> . however, we also find that lap <dig> specifically co-immunoprecipitates with tora-e171q, but not tora-Δe , despite similar expression and capture of both gfp-tagged torsina isoforms . we also compared tora-e171q and tora-Δe binding to the er-localized tora binding partner, lull <dig>  again, we find no detectable co-immunoprecipitation of lull <dig> with tora-Δe, although lull <dig> is co-captured by tora-e171q immunoprecipitation . thus, it appears that the e171q and Δe mutations differentially affect binding to the two verified tora binding partners, even in cell systems where both mutations cause tora to accumulate in the ne.

co-immunoprecipitation of lap <dig> with tora requires that binding is maintained after detergent solubilization removes both proteins from the er membrane. it is therefore possible that Δe inhibits this assessment of tora binding to lap <dig>  while interaction in vivo continues to underlie tora-Δe localization in the ne, and this could be exacerbated because we are examining human tora in a mouse cell line. consequently, we next examined whether lap <dig> is important for the in vivo localization of tora-Δe. to semi-quantitatively assess protein localization in vivo, we measured the relative amount of ne and er-localized protein in individual cells. this method finds ratios of ne/er localized fluorescent signal above one for the inner nuclear membrane proteins of lap <dig>  lap <dig> and emerin  of ne/er localized lap <dig> fluorescence is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , lap <dig> is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and emerin is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ). in contrast, er-resident proteins that do not accumulate in the ne display relative ne/er fluorescence ratios below one  is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , n = 25).

we subsequently co-transfected nih-3t <dig> cells with tora-wt, tora-Δe, or tora-e171q, together with scrambled control or lap <dig> sirna duplexes. in agreement with previous reports where lap <dig> was required for the ne accumulation of tora-e171q  <cit> , the semi-quantitative analysis detected that lap <dig> depletion significantly reduces the mean ratio of ne/er localized tora-e171q fluorescence . however, in contrast, lap <dig> knock-down did not affect the ratio of ne/er tora-Δe fluorescent signal . qualitative analysis similarly highlights that tora-Δe is strongly concentrated in the ne of lap <dig> depleted cells , while the absence of lap <dig> inhibits the ne-accumulation of tora-e171q, which is instead predominantly er-localized . although tora-wt is previously shown to biochemically associate with lap <dig>  <cit> , and lap <dig> overexpression increases the amount of ne-localized tora-wt  <cit> , we failed to detect lap1-induced change in tora-wt localization. however, this may be due to the insensitivity of our measurements, rather than absence of in vivo interaction between tora-wt and lap <dig> 

linc complex components are required for tora-Δe localization in the ne
this lack of interaction between tora-Δe and lap <dig> reveals that a distinct mechanism underlies the ne-accumulation of the disease-associated tora isoform. furthermore, although tora-Δe concentrates in the ne of the majority of nih-3t <dig> and bhk <dig> cells, we consistently observe a minority of cells where tora-Δe is diffusely distributed through the er tora-Δe), and this variability does not correlate with levels of lap <dig> . we hypothesized that this inconsistency in tora-Δe localization might reflect the variable presence of a ne-localized tora-Δe binding partner and we proceeded to examine the subcellular localization of several ne membrane proteins. we focused on the linc complex proteins that couple the nucleus with cytoskeletal networks, as these have previously been associated with tora  <cit> . the linc complex is formed in the ne lumen between inner nuclear membrane sun-domain proteins and outer nuclear membrane nesprins, and we find that nih-3t <dig> cells express both of the functionally homologous sun <dig> and sun <dig> proteins  <cit> . we also detect ne-localized nesprin <dig> in nih-3t <dig> cells, although nesprin <dig> is absent  <cit>  and anti-nesprin <dig> signal appears golgi-localized , thus indicating that nesprin <dig> is the predominant nesprin protein of nih-3t <dig> cells.

while the majority of nih-3t <dig> cells possess ne-localized anti-sun <dig>  anti-sun <dig> and anti-nesprin <dig> immunoreactivity, we also observe some interphase cells with minimal amounts of ne-localized fluorescent signal, or punctate anti-linc component immunoreactivity outside of the ne . in contrast, the inner nuclear membrane proteins of emerin, lap <dig> and lap <dig> are consistently ne-localized in interphase cells , suggesting that this variability is linc complex specific. we consequently examined whether tora-Δe localization correlates with the variability in linc complex protein localization and found that cells with ne-localized anti-sun <dig>  anti-sun <dig> or anti-nesprin <dig> labeling also display ne-localized tora-Δe . in contrast, tora-Δe is diffusely distributed through the er system in cells that lack ne-localized linc complex components, or when these were present at low levels . furthermore, we often also observed that tora-Δe co-localized with sun1-immunoreactive puncta outside the ne . we subsequently confirmed this qualitative association between tora-Δe and linc complex localization by examining the ratio of ne/er localized anti-sun <dig>  anti-sun <dig> and anti-nesprin <dig> fluorescence in cells with either ne- or er-localized tora-Δe. this analysis found that the ratios of ne/er localized linc complex components were significantly higher for cells with ne-localized tora-Δe , compared with cells where tora-Δe is predominantly present in the main er . in contrast, we found no correlation between tora-Δe localization and the relative ne/er levels of lap <dig>  emerin or lap <dig> .

we next examined whether any linc complex components are required for tora-Δe to localize in the ne. we co-transfected nih-3t <dig> cells with tora isoforms alongside scrambled control sirna duplexes, or sun <dig>  sun <dig>  or nesprin <dig> sirna duplexes that were verified to reduce expression of each linc complex component . this revealed that sun <dig> is required for tora-Δe to concentrate in ne, and we find er-localized tora-Δe, or a punctate distribution of tora-Δe, in cells lacking sun <dig> . as expected, this change in subcellular localization is reflected by a significant decrease in relative ne/er tora-Δe fluorescence between control and sun <dig> depleted cells . in contrast, tora-e171q continues to concentrate in the ne of sun <dig> sirna treated cells  and sun <dig> sirna does not appear to alter the relative ne/er localization of tora-e171q . this suggests that sun <dig> loss specifically affects tora-Δe without perturbing all ne-localized interactions. we do not observe gross differences in the localization of any tora isoform after sun <dig> or nesprin <dig> depletion . we also determined that the relative ne/er fluorescence of both tora-Δe and tora-e171q remains high in sun <dig> sirna transfected cells . surprisingly, this semi-quantitative analysis identified that nesprin <dig> depletion increases the ratio of ne/er localized tora-Δe . thus, although nesprins are identified as tora-binding proteins  <cit> , it appears that removing nesprin <dig> may increase the number of ne-localized tora-Δe binding sites.

tora-wt and tora-Δe localization in the ne requires motifs that are not involved in tora-e171q interaction with lap1
these observations suggest that an association exists between tora-Δe and the sun <dig> linc complex component, and therefore that sun <dig>  rather than lap <dig>  may be an ne partner of tora-Δe. we subsequently examined whether these two putative tora binding interactions require distinct tora domains or residues. we first investigated the importance of the tora membrane association domain that immediately follows the cleaved er targeting sequence  <cit>  . we transfected nih-3t <dig> cells with either full-length tora isoforms, or tora isoforms that lacked residues  <dig> to  <dig>  that includes the membrane-association domain. we found that tora-e171q lacking residues 22- <dig> continues to accumulate in the ne , indicating that this domain is not required for lap <dig> binding, as is consistent with previous study of the tora - lull <dig> interaction  <cit> . in contrast, Δ22- <dig> inhibits the ne-concentration of tora-Δe, and we fail to observe any cells with ne-localized tora-Δe when residues 22- <dig> are removed . we also observed that Δ22- <dig> appeared to decrease the amount of ne-localized tora-wt . we therefore semi-quantitatively examined tora-wt localization, which revealed that introduction of Δ22- <dig> caused a significant  decrease in the relative amount of ne/er localized tora-wt fluorescence from a mean ± s.e.m. of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . thus, the membrane association domain of tora is both essential for the sun1-dependent ne accumulation of tora-Δe, and appears to play a role in a tora-wt localization, despite not affecting tora interaction with lap <dig> or lull <dig> 

we also explored whether other tora motifs are important for tora localization in the ne. aaa+ enzymes typically alter substrate conformation using aromatic amino-acid residues that line the pore of the assembled aaa+ ring structure. work with model aaa+ proteins has suggested that these residues interact with substrate and undergo 'lever-like' movements to pull substrates into the central pore  <cit> . we identified a tora tyrosine residue  that lies in the approximate position of other aaa+ substrate-binding tyrosine residues. furthermore, this residue is conserved between all vertebrate and invertebrate tora homologs , suggesting a functional importance in torsin enzyme activity. with the hypothesis that this residue may be specifically important for tora binding with substrate, we compared how mutation  affects tora-Δe localization in the ne compared with the lap1-dependent ne-localization of tora-e171q. as with residues 22- <dig>  we observed that the y147a mutation specifically inhibits the ne-localization of tora-Δe, while tora-e171q continues to accumulate in the ne . we again also observed an apparent loss of ne-localized tora-wt fluorescent signal and therefore semi-quantitatively examined how y147a affects tora-wt localization. this revealed that the y147a mutation significantly reduces  the ratio of ne/er tora-wt fluorescence from a mean ± s.e.m. of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . thus, the y <dig> residue is required for both the ne-concentration of tora-Δe, as well as for tora-wt to localize in the ne.

sun <dig> depletion removes tora-wt from the ne
the importance of 22- <dig> and y <dig> for wt and tora-Δe localization in the ne suggests that these tora isoforms form a similar, lap1-independent, binding interaction. consistent with this hypothesis, we often observed that sun <dig> depletion reduced the small amount of ne-localized tora-wt fluorescence present in most cells  <cit>  . our initial analysis found that sun <dig> sirna did not significantly decrease the ratio of ne/er localized tora-wt fluorescence. however, since a proportion of control treated cells also lack ne-localized sun <dig> , we hypothesized that our approach may have yielded a false-negative result. consequently, we reassessed the ratio of ne/er localized tora-wt fluorescence in individual control sirna transfected cells that we verified possessed sun <dig>  and compared this with cells that were sun <dig> sirna treated and verified to lack sun <dig>  this analysis found that the control ratio of ne/er tora-wt fluorescence in sun1-containing cells ) is significantly reduced  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   when sun <dig> sirna transfection depletes cellular sun <dig>  thus, it appears that some tora-wt is normally sun1-associated in vivo, which suggests sun <dig> is a normal tora partner, as well as the protein responsible for the abnormal ne accumulation of disease-associated tora-Δe.

discussion
lap <dig> has been consistently identified as a ne-localized binding partner of tora  <cit> , and it appears that lap <dig> is required for ne-localized tora activity  <cit> . however, we find that the ne localization of both tora-wt and tora-Δe require tora-motifs that are unimportant for the lap <dig> interaction. furthermore, we show that sun <dig> depletion removes tora-wt and tora-Δe from the ne, while lap <dig> is not required for tora-Δe to concentrate in the ne. therefore, although lap <dig> is the confirmed binding partner for atp-bound tora, lap <dig> is neither the sole ne-localized tora interacting protein nor the partner of disease-associated tora-Δe.

the multiple differences between tora-e171q and tora-Δe reveal that distinct mechanisms underlie their superficially similar ability to concentrate in the ne lumen  <cit> . while it appears that the e171q mutation traps tora in an atp-bound state, the mechanism by which Δe affects tora remains unclear. a previous genetic analysis found that tora-Δe cannot compensate for tora loss, therefore revealing that this isoform is hypoactive or inactive  <cit> . biochemical analysis has also demonstrated that tora-Δe may fail to bind atp, or perhaps fail to undergo a structural rearrangement on atp-binding  <cit> , either of which may explain why tora-Δe cannot form the atp-dependent interaction with lap <dig> or lull <dig>  <cit> . despite these inhibitory effects, our data now highlight that Δe does not generate a 'dead' tora isoform that is incapable of all binding interactions. instead, the abnormal association between tora-Δe and sun <dig> suggests that Δe 'traps' tora in a specific conformation that is distinct to the atp-bound state. this finding also provides further evidence that the dyt <dig> Δe mutation has a gain-of-function activity, in addition to producing the previously characterized impairment of tora function.

our data indicate that tora associates with the sun <dig> linc complex component, and that the dyt <dig> mutation abnormally promotes or stabilizes this interaction. sun <dig> is an inner nuclear membrane component of the linc complex that couples the nuclear interior to cytoskeletal networks. sun <dig> has a nucleoplasmic domain that mediates interaction with lamins, an extended membrane spanning hydrophobic region, and an approximately  <dig> kd luminal domain that appears to mediate both sun-protein multimerization and interaction with kash-domains of outer nuclear membrane nesprin proteins  <cit> . there is loss-of-function evidence for functional redundancy between sun <dig> and the similarly widely expressed and homologous sun <dig>  <cit> . it is therefore surprising to find that sun <dig> is specifically required for tora localization in the ne. we cannot rule out that sun <dig> is selectively required because nih-3t <dig> cells predominantly rely on sun <dig>  or that sun <dig> sirna more efficiently depletes sun <dig> from the ne. however, there are reported differences in sun <dig> and sun <dig> characteristics  <cit> , and our finding that sun <dig> is selectively important for tora localization provides further evidence that these proteins have distinct, as well as overlapping cellular roles.

we do not resolve whether tora interacts directly or indirectly with sun <dig>  however, there is evidence against the possibility that sun <dig> loss causes general ne disruption that removes tora by a highly indirect mechanism. several previous studies have shown that ne structure and linc complex function are largely normal in the absence of sun <dig>  and that combined sun <dig> and sun <dig> loss is required to perturb ne morphology  <cit> . consistent with these findings, we observe that the ne-localization of lap1-associated tora-e171q is undisturbed by sun <dig> loss, and that other inner nuclear membrane proteins are normally localized in cells lacking sun <dig> . furthermore, we also find that tora-Δe colocalizes with sun <dig> in puncta that lie outside of the ne. thus, while it is possible that tora indirectly associates with sun <dig>  any such indirect interaction would be mediated by a protein or proteins that are also tightly coupled to sun <dig>  unfortunately, we were unable to biochemically verify that a direct or indirect interaction exists between tora and sun <dig>  like many inner nuclear membrane proteins, sun <dig> solubilization requires that ionic detergents disrupt binding to the nuclear lamina and chromatin  <cit> . this treatment necessarily also impairs luminal interactions and a failure to detect biochemical association does not preclude that sun <dig> and tora interact in vivo. furthermore, despite our negative findings with anti-gfp immunoprecipitation of tora isoforms, one previous report described that nesprin kash-domains co-immunoprecipitate with anti-tora antibodies  <cit> , which provides general support for an interaction between tora and a linc complex component. however, our finding that nesprin <dig> depletion increases, rather than decreases, the amount of ne-localized tora-Δe, indicates that this previous result reflects an indirect, rather than direct, interaction between tora and nesprins. it is unclear why nesprin <dig> loss increases tora-Δe localization in the ne. however, an increased number of tora-Δe binding sites, perhaps caused by compensatory upregulation of other linc components, could account for both our observations and the previous association between tora and the nesprin kash-domain.

our findings support a model where tora interacts with at least two different ne proteins  <cit> . the existence of additional ne-localized partners suggests that tora either operates on multiple substrates and/or that some identified tora interacting partners have a regulatory function and are not subject to tora aaa+ activity. finding that the sun1-dependent localization requires a putative substrate interaction residue  <cit> , y <dig>  suggests that sun <dig> or the linc complex is a substrate affected by tora aaa+ activity. surprisingly, this also suggests that y147a destabilizes an interaction that is distinct to the atp-bound tora state that associates with lap <dig> and lull <dig>  this insensitivity of lap <dig> and lull <dig> binding raises the possibility that these proteins are not tora substrates. furthermore, these data also suggest that tora could operate using an atypical biochemical aaa+ mechanism; a hypothesis that is supported by the presence of a non-canonical nucleotide binding motif in the tora aaa+ domain that appears to convey preferential binding to adp, rather than atp  <cit> .

the possibility that tora activity modifies the linc complex is also supported by two previous reports. in one study, tora loss appeared to remove the nesprin <dig> linc complex component from the ne, suggesting that tora normally maintains intact linc complexes  <cit> . in contrast, a separate study made the reverse observation, and found that overexpression of the lull <dig> tora-binding partner appeared to induce a ne-localized tora activity that removed sun <dig> and nesprin <dig>  <cit> . this lull1-activated tora was strongly concentrated in the ne of cells that lacked sun <dig> and nesprin <dig>  which supports our finding that sun <dig> is important for the ne retention of tora. furthermore, since aaa+ activity often disassembles otherwise stable protein complexes  <cit> , this data is also consistent with tora dissociating sun <dig> binding interactions to release sun1-associated proteins from the ne lumen. the relationship between the lull1-overexpression paradigm and physiological tora function is unclear, and there are some aaa+ proteins that promote protein complex formation or remodeling, rather than disassembly  <cit> . therefore, a difference between the actions of physiological levels of tora activity, versus overactive tora enzymes, could explain the discrepancy between these two studies.

while our study emphases a relationship between tora and the linc complex, it is also clear that lap <dig> has a central role in tora function and, notably, lap <dig> and tora gene knock-out result in the same ne membrane abnormalities  <cit> . although this association does not resolve whether lap <dig> activity is upstream  or downstream  of tora activity, it is clear that lap <dig> is the partner of the atp-bound form of tora that is typically the substrate-associated state of a aaa+ protein  <cit> . there are examples of promiscuous aaa+ enzymes that operate on several distinct substrate proteins, and it is possible that tora is a multi-functional aaa+ protein that operates on both lap <dig> and the linc complex. furthermore, since adapter proteins often regulate the substrate selection of multifunctional aaa+ proteins  <cit> , the importance of y <dig>  residues 22- <dig>  and the effect of Δe, could be explained if these motifs affect tora interaction with an adapter that promotes the linc complex association over lap <dig> binding.

our study is performed using cells that also express tora. it is therefore possible that these endogenous tora-wt subunits play a role in the association between tora-Δe and sun <dig>  nevertheless, mixed tora-Δe and tora-wt expression also occurs in dyt <dig> dystonia, and it is demonstrated that tora abnormally concentrates in the ne of dyt <dig> dystonia cells, as well as neurons ectopically expressing tora-Δe  <cit> . thus, our findings suggest that the linc complex of dyt <dig> dystonia neurons is abnormally associated with tora-Δe. there are several mechanisms by which an abnormal association between tora-Δe and sun <dig> could negatively impact cell function. firstly, tora-Δe occupation of binding sites could prevent functional tora enzymes from accessing the linc complex, and therefore inhibit tora activity in the event that this normally modifies the linc complex. secondly, there is evidence that tora-wt and tora-Δe co-oligomerize, and that the abnormal sun1-association of tora-Δe is conferred to co-expressed tora-wt  <cit> . this could result in tora-wt sequestration away from other molecular targets of tora aaa+ activity. a third possibility is that abnormal association with tora-Δe directly impacts linc complex assembly or function, independent of tora-wt activity. these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible that a combination of such loss-of-function and/or gain-of-function tora-Δe actions underlie why dyt <dig> dystonia is dominant and the tora-Δe generating mutation is the only identified cause of this disease.

our study did not identify grossly abnormal linc complex component localization in cells transfected to express tora-Δe. however, our assessment did not examine whether physiological tora-Δe expression impacts linc complex components as these are utilized during particular cellular behaviors, such as nuclear movement  <cit> . it is unlikely that tora-Δe expression completely ablates linc complex activity, as genetic deletion of the complex in mice results in severe neurodevelopmental abnormalities  <cit> , compared with undetectable or limited neuropathology in human dyt <dig> dystonia patients and heterozygous tora-Δe expressing mice  <cit> . however, given the importance of the linc complex for nervous system development  <cit> , it is conceivable that tora-Δe driven abnormalities in linc complex mediated events impact neuronal development to generate the circuit abnormalities that are thought to underlie the debilitating twisting movements of dyt <dig> dystonia  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated an association between the dyt <dig> dystonia protein, tora-Δe, and the sun <dig> component of the linc complex. we also find evidence that sun <dig> is a normal tora partner, which therefore suggests that the Δe mutation stabilizes a normally transient tora binding interaction. these findings raise the possibility that tora-Δe may impact the linc complex, and therefore implicate linc complex dysfunction in dyt <dig> dystonia.
