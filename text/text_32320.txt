BACKGROUND
heterologous protein production processes in the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris became increasingly important in the last decade. although p. pastoris is known as a highly efficient expression system, there is only little knowledge about the physiology and the genetics lying underneath.

especially the production of complex proteins has turned out to have a rather low success rate . several physiological studies have demonstrated that many processes, including stress responses to environmental factors, and protein folding/aggregation and secretion are highly interrelated. among the environmental factors influencing protein expression and secretion, ph, osmolarity, oxygen availability and temperature appear to be particularly important .

during the development of p. pastoris strains secreting either the human serine protease trypsinogen  <cit> , rhizopus oryzae lipase  <cit> , or the fab fragments of the human monoclonal anti-hiv <dig> antibody 2f <dig>  <cit>  and its anti-ideoptype 3h <dig>  <cit> , limitations in folding and/or secretion became obvious. using immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry techniques we could detect intracellularly retained product, which was found to be located within the membrane fraction of cell lysates , and a concomitant increase in the levels of intracellular bip , which is described as a signal molecule for unfolded protein response  . on the other hand it has been shown that constitutive induction of the upr pathway by overexpression of the transcriptional activator hac1p can promote folding and secretion of heterologous proteins in several hosts, including saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , aspergillus niger var. awamori  <cit>  and p. pastoris  <cit> .

to our knowledge there exists no report about the regulation of gene expression upon activation of the upr pathway in p. pastoris so far. we attempted to analyse these responses in more detail and to determine the possible induction of the upr as result of the overexpression of heterologous proteins on a transcriptional level. the rapid transcriptional profiling method trac  that has been successfully implemented for t. reesei  <cit>  was employed in this study to monitor the levels of a subset of mrnas coding for upr-regulated and stress-connected genes in p. pastoris.

while a lot of data has been collected regarding the regulatory events as a reaction to temperature changes, there is not much information on the true cellular reaction particularly in context of heterologous protein expression. the optimum growth temperature for p. pastoris is usually defined as 28–30°c, however, it is well established that a reduction of the temperature to e.g. 25°c can significantly improve recombinant protein productivity without hampering growth  <cit> . jahic et al.  <cit>  suggested that lower temperature leads to a reduced death rate, and hence a lower amount of host cell proteases in the supernatant. while this seems plausible, it should be noted that during our work we did not find such an influence of temperature on cell death at common growth temperatures  <cit> .

therefore a deeper understanding of the physiological and molecular links between protein folding and temperature  appears useful.

we investigated production characteristics at 20°c compared to 25°c in chemostat cultivations expressing 2f <dig> fab fragment. first results indicated that specific product formation rate was  <dig> -fold higher at the lower temperature compared to steady state conditions at 25°c. therefore transcriptional profiling with the trac method was employed to study whether this increase in product secretion is a result of increased levels of upr-regulated genes or if there are alternative mechanisms lying underneath.

RESULTS
expression of more than  <dig> genes was monitored by the trac method in four recombinant p. pastoris strains and the wild type grown in various conditions
trac analysis was performed in duplicates for each sample in two of the authors' laboratories in finland  and austria . variation between these duplicate assays  was 10% on the average, and independent of signal strength as it was reported for t. reesei samples by  <cit> .

for the temperature experiments, the ratio of the fluorescence intensity per ng polya rna  in 20°c steady state to the fl in 25°c steady state samples was determined individually for each of the two biological replicas. the mean ratio was calculated for each probe, with the standard deviation  of the ratios being 21% on average. so the overall standard deviation of the temperature experiment  adds up to 25%. the probability  that the fl 20°c does actually differ significantly from fl 25°c was assessed with a student t-test.

the p. pastoris gene annotations in the ergo genome database  are derived using a number of criteria  <cit>  including orthology to s. cerevisiae gene function. consequently, all the discussion will be based on the respective descriptions  given in the saccharomyces genome database  <cit> .

functions of the s. cerevisiae homologs of the p. pastoris gene markers  assigned in functional categories.

effect of hac1-overexpression on the regulation of marker genes in p. pastoris
as the active form of p. pastoris hac1p is not identified yet, the s. cerevisiae homolog was used. cross species functionality of hac1p has been demonstrated between s. cerevisiae and p. pastoris  <cit> , and t. reesei respectively  <cit> . therefore, trac analysis of shake flask cultivations of p. pastoris strains co-overexpressing s. cerevisiae upr-transcription factor hac1p was applied to identify upr-targets in p. pastoris and the responses were compared to those observed in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in that study, s. cerevisiae upr target genes were induced by dithiothreitol  and tunicamycin, two agents known to interfere with protein folding in the er.

both p. pastoris gs <dig>  and the protease deficient strain smd <dig>  containing s. cerevisiae hac <dig> were analysed, and no difference could be seen in the regulation of the marker genes included in our analysis. therefore a mean value of these two experiments was compared to untransformed x <dig> as control strain.

more than a 2-fold induction of genes like kar <dig> , pdi <dig> , ero <dig>  and sec <dig>  was observed in p. pastoris , analogous to the upr response described for s. cerevisiae <cit> . strong enhancement in the transcription of genes involved in the er quality control and glycosylation such as cne <dig> , rot <dig>  and sec <dig>  was predominant in p. pastoris, while components of the er-associated protein degradation  represented by hrd <dig> and ubc <dig> showed a more consistent upregulation, as compared to s. cerevisiae. also the down-regulation of core metabolism genes such as pfk <dig> , cit <dig> , glt <dig> and aro <dig>  and ribosomal genes  during upr induction seems to be a common feature for both of the yeasts , while the transcription of other genes is differentially regulated between the two organisms.

remarkably, the oppositional regulation of the two general stress markers gcn <dig> and msn <dig> was noticed. while gcn <dig> was upregulated in p. pastoris but down-regulated in s. cerevisiae, msn <dig> behaved the other way round . induction of gcn <dig> transcription in response to dtt treatment or heterologous protein expression was reported for t. reesei, as well as enhanced expression levels of some of its putative target genes related to amino acid biosynthesis, among them glt <dig>  arg <dig>  aro <dig>  <cit> . on the contrary to t. reesei we can not see a similar behaviour of the amino acid biosynthesis genes included in our marker set, as levels of glt <dig>  are strongly reduced, while arg <dig>  transcription is enhanced. recently, patil and coworkers  <cit>  described activation of gcn4p by er stress and suggested that it acts as an essential transcription factor for the upr together with or downstream of hac1p. a link between er stress and oxidative stress was established in mammalian cells, where the expression of the gcn <dig> homolog atf <dig> regulates glutathione biosynthesis and thereby protects the cells against the accumulation of reactive oxygen species deriving from the oxidative protein folding machinery in the er and the erad  <cit> . both glutathione  and thioredoxin  related genes show higher expression levels in the hac1p-overproducing strain compared to the control strain in p. pastoris .

no direct connection between the general environmental response transcriptional activator msn <dig>  <cit>  and upr regulation has been reported so far. most significantly, a fraction of genes that are correlated to general stress response appears to be induced in s. cerevisiae but remains unchanged to down-regulated in p. pastoris along with msn <dig> . among them hem <dig> serves as a marker for oxygen availability, rad <dig> and rad <dig> belong to the dna repair mechanism, arl <dig> and vps <dig> are connected to the transport between the endosomal compartment and the golgi, while snooze genes are members of stationary phase related gene family and reported to be induced both by pyridoxal and thiamin depletion  <cit> . the involvement of the hog <dig>  pathway in more general environmental stress responses was discussed in  <cit> , and can be connected to the regulation of many other genes including hsp <dig> .

induction of the unfolded protein response by heterologous protein secretion
in order to elucidate the behaviour of genes typically known to be under upr-regulation additionally to other stress-associated markers in recombinant protein producing cells, p. pastoris strains secreting the 2f <dig> antibody fragment under control of the gap promoter were examined and their response was compared to the hac1p-overproducing strains in figure  <dig> 

trac analysis of these cultures revealed that production of 2f <dig> fab actually induces genes identified as upr-targets before. genes such as kar <dig>  pdi <dig>  rot <dig>  ero <dig>  calnexin, sec <dig>  and sec <dig> are significantly upregulated, although not to the same magnitude as in the hac1p-overproducing strains. additionally, expression levels of genes belonging to the core metabolism , general stress response  and ribosomal components  showed down regulation in the fab-expressing strain, as has been observed in the strain constitutively overexpressing the upr transcription factor hac1p. out of  <dig> genes detected to be under hac1p-specific activation,  <dig> appeared to be up-regulated in the fab-expressing strain, and all of the three genes identified to be under hac1p-dependent down-regulation showed lower transcription levels also in the recombinant strain. no explanation can be given for the divergent regulation pattern of hsp <dig> 

previous transcriptional studies in aspergillus nidulans and t. reesei are in agreement with our finding that changes in mrna levels are more subtle and specific in recombinant protein producing strains than in cultures treated with secretion blockers like dtt, tunicamycin and brefeldin a or strains with constitutively activated upr  <cit> .

no reduction of upr activation due to pdi <dig> overexpression
furthermore, folding engineered strains constitutively co-producing s. cerevisiae pdi <dig> or hac1p, which were identified to increase 2f <dig> fab secretion  <dig> - and  <dig> - fold, respectively  <cit> , were subjected to trac analysis and compared to their parental strain. the results are displayed in figure  <dig> 

out of  <dig> transcripts established to be up-regulated in response to upr activation,  <dig> can be found to be at least  <dig> -fold induced in the hac1p-expressing strain as compared to the strain expressing only 2f <dig> fab . the genes detected to be down-regulated in the hac1p-overexpressing strain as compared to the wild-type show no regulation here as they also have significantly lower expression levels in the fab expressing strain .

interestingly, when analysing the pdi1-overexpressing strains , we found that most genes seem to be unaffected by pdi <dig> overexpression at a transcriptional level, although 2f <dig> fab secretion rates are enhanced under these conditions. unlike xu et al.  <cit>  who reported a relief of upr induction caused by recombinant protein expression when pdi <dig> is overexpressed in s. cerevisiae, our results suggest that overexpression of s. cerevisiae pdi <dig> does not alleviate upr stress in p. pastoris. thus it is likely that there are other mechanisms easing the secretion of the antibody fragments. interestingly, there are several genes belonging to the vesicular protein transport system involved in er to golgi and golgi to plasma membrane transport , and the erad among the genes most induced  in the pdi1p-coproducing strain, however, some genes connected to pdi <dig> like ero <dig> and the cyclophilin type peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cpr <dig> have significantly lower transcription levels in this strain.

influence of cultivation temperature on protein secretion rates and transcriptional response
after monitoring the transcriptional effects specific to upr induction on a chosen gene set in p. pastoris, we intended to uncover the transcriptional responses occurring in cells under production conditions. the particular interest of this collaborative work was to study the interactions between cellular responses triggered by protein overproduction , and different cultivation temperatures as an example for environmental  conditions.

as our usual production processes were set up at 25°c  <cit> , we intended to investigate production characteristics at an even lower, but still feasible temperature of 20°c. two independent chemostat cultivations of a p. pastoris strain secreting 2f <dig> fab under control of the gap promoter have been conducted, with a dilution rate of d =  <dig>  h- <dig> and glucose as carbon source, one starting at 25°c and shifted to 20°c after  <dig> volume changes, the other vice versa. in both experiments the biomass reached approx.  <dig> g/l ydm at both temperatures, however, fab secretion levels were elevated on average  <dig> -fold at the lower temperature . the difference was determined to be highly significant by a student t-test .

chemostat  <dig> was cultivated at 25°c first and temperature was lowered to 20°c after  <dig> volume changes, chemostat  <dig> was performed vice versa. steady state conditions were assumed after  <dig> volume changes. biomass , 2f <dig> fab concentration  and specific production rate qp are given for both cultivations, additionally to the mean ratio of 20°c to 25°c for each of these parameters.

similar improvement of secretion of a single chain fragment  upon a reduction to 20°c  was reported for s. cerevisiae  <cit> , while li et al.  <cit>  described a positive effect of lower temperature  on growth and viability during the expression of a herring antifreeze protein in p. pastoris, but it should be considered that their data result from shake flasks only. in our experiments, viability remained constantly high  at both temperatures examined.

although the transcriptional levels of the product genes  were reduced at 20°c compared to cultivation on 25°c , specific productivity of the 2f <dig> fab protein was significantly increased during the chemostat process at lower temperature . several genes related to protein targeting to the er and folding  and core metabolism genes can be found among the genes down-regulated at 20°c. transcription of genes involved in the regulation of vesicular transport, exocytosis, er-associated protein degradation as well as markers for response to oxidative and hyperosmotic stress was enhanced in comparison to 25°c steady state .

since there was strong evidence that  unfolded product was retained inside the cells during fed batch cultivations  <cit> , thus leading to an upregulation of the upr marker protein bip, we investigated the behaviour of these proteins also in the chemostat. according to immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometer analysis intracellular product levels  are increased at the lower temperature , on the contrary to bip which shows the same trend as its transcript kar <dig>  our hypothesis is that at the lower temperature less folding stress is provoked by the native pichia proteins and consequently less cumulative pressure is imposed on the folding machinery. therefore no induction of bip transcription could be seen at the lower temperature although more of the recombinant protein was accumulated intracellularly.

er associated protein degradation is a process detecting misfolded proteins in the er and redirecting them to the translocon for retranslocation to the cytosol, where they are subjected to proteasomal degradation. additionally, excess subunits of multimeric proteins that are unable to assemble are degraded through the erad mechanism  <cit> . with hrd <dig>  coding for an ubiquitin-protein ligase, that is able to recruit ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes such as the gene product of ubc <dig> next to the translocon pore complex , three essential components of the erad pathway are up-regulated in correlation to higher protein secretion rates. one could speculate that increased erad activity at lower temperature might lead to degradation of excess hc, thus reducing er stress conditions and therefore leading to better secretion. however, no evidence is given that excess hc is degraded, as intracellular product levels are increased at the lower temperature. no components of the proteasomal system have been included into the study.

all analysed members of the hsp70-family of chaperones are less transcribed at the lower temperature. this performance can be explained in concordance with their stringent requirement in conditions of heat shock. together bip/kar2p and the ssa-proteins  are required for the import of nascent polypeptides through the translocon into the er lumen, where bip is acting as a chaperone. bip is also necessary for the degradation of misfolded proteins. however, so far no essential role of the ssa-proteins in the retrograde transport of misfolded soluble proteins during erad has been identified  <cit> . the chaperonines of the sse/hsp <dig> subclass of the hsp <dig> family, that are encoded by sse <dig> and sse <dig>  assist in folding by binding to nascent peptides and holding them in a folding-competent state, however, they can not actively promote folding reactions.

other transcripts significantly down-regulated at the lower temperature belong to the phosphomannomutase sec <dig>  the protein o-mannosyltransferase pmt <dig>  both being involved in glycosylation of secretory proteins as well as to the er resident thiol-oxidase ero <dig> . the product of the imh1/sys <dig> gene is a member of the peripheral membrane golgins involved in vesicular transport between the late golgi and a prevacuolar, endosome-like compartment  <cit> .

the transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes in response to amino acid starvation gcn <dig> is downregulated  <dig> -fold at 20°c steady state levels. although it might be speculated that a lower concentration of gcn <dig> can lead to lower transcription of amino acid biosynthesis genes, in our experiment only glt <dig>  is significantly reduced. the pathways for aromatic amino acids  and arginine biosynthesis  tend to be downregulated. also the pentose phosphate shunt  and the transcription of citrate synthase  – the rate-limiting enzyme of the tca cycle – are less active at 20°c. this reduction in transcriptional activity of the core metabolism is a likely explanation for the reduced mrna levels of the product genes , which are under control of the glycolytic gap  promoter. essentially the same regulation pattern of amino acid biosynthesis genes and core metabolism genes was observed in a non-expressing control strain cultivated under the same conditions . interestingly, the transcript levels of the ribosomal proteins  are raised in both the fab expressing and the non-expressing strain at 20°c.

unlike the general transcriptional activator in response to different stresses, msn <dig>  which shows reduced transcription, the genes coding for the key regulatory enzymes of both the cell redox homeostasis  and osmoregulation  kinase hog1) are induced at the lower temperature. this seems to be a more general effect of the reduced temperature as the same regulation pattern can be observed in the p. pastoris control strain cultivated under the same conditions . recently, activation of the hog pathway upon a downshift in temperature  was monitored in s. cerevisiae, whereas in schizosaccharomyces pombe the sty1p map-kinase  lead to the activation of several cold-induced genes  <cit> . these authors conclude that the hog pathway is regulated by changes in membrane fluidity, and that the downward shift in temperature results in the accumulation of glycerol in the yeast cells, while having no major effect on cell viability. furthermore an increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide and subsequent induction of anti-oxidant genes was revealed in response to a temperature downshift from  <dig> to 10°c in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . these results suggest that the cells are subjected to  oxidative stress after cultivation in a low temperature environment, a phenomenon also shared with plants like arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> .

also the transcript of another regulatory enzyme, the 14-3- <dig> protein bmh <dig>  is elevated at the lower temperature, at which higher rates of secretion were observed. 14-3- <dig> proteins, encoded by bmh <dig> and bmh <dig>  were identified to participate in multiple steps of vesicular trafficking, especially in protein exit from the er, forward trafficking of multimeric cell surface membrane proteins  <cit>  as well as in retrograde transportation within the golgi apparatus. in s. cerevisiae the induction of bmh <dig> has been reported to reduce transcription of folding related genes such as ssa1/ <dig>  ero <dig>  hsp  <dig>  kar <dig> and cpr <dig> upon a shift from 37°c to 25°c  <cit> , which may also be the case in our experiments.

the yeast syntaxin homologs sso <dig> and sso <dig> are necessary for the fusion of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane by acting as target  for the vesicle membrane receptor protein  snc <dig>  both transcripts were identified to be up-regulated at the reduced temperature under production conditions.

two genes belonging to the dna damage response show significantly altered expression upon the temperature reduction; however, the dna endonuclease  is induced while rad <dig> is down-regulated. detailed functions of proteins involved in the nucleotide excision repair in yeasts are reviewed by  <cit> , however, their connection to cultivation temperature or protein secretion remains elusive.

generally, the reduction of temperature from 25°c to 20°c does not trigger a transcriptional reaction as definite as the overproduction of the upr transcription factor hac1p. as displayed in figure  <dig>  lowering temperature leads to a regulation pattern that is partially divergent from the upr specific regulation, with a special discrepancy of single genes such as the hsps. interestingly, genes of the core metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis and ribosome biosynthesis, as well as redox and osmotic stress response, were regulated similarly in the fab-expressing p. pastoris strain and a non-expressing control strain. on the other hand, genes belonging to the protein secretory pathway remained unchanged in the control strain, while being significantly regulated in the fab expressing strain.

two regulation patterns common to adaptation upon temperature changes were identified also to be conserved in p. pastoris. it becomes obvious that the effects caused upon temperature reduction are not ostensibly upr dependent, but that this regulation is overlapped by alternative  mechanisms of regulation leading to the final enhancement of antibody fragment secretion.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate the importance of monitoring transcriptional regulations during recombinant protein production processes in real production strains instead of model organisms, even if there are no dna microarrays available. the transcriptional profiling method trac proved to be a valuable tool to analyse genomic responses of a subset of marker genes in p. pastoris, and to compare them to those observed in s. cerevisiae. upon upr induction a lot of markers showed similar transcriptional regulation in both yeasts, however, a significant fraction of transcript levels of genes belonging to general stress response are behaving in an opposite way. both the effects of s. cerevisiae hac1p and pdi <dig> overexpression in p. pastoris was studied, additionally to the responses induced by secretion of 2f <dig> fab antibody fragment.

interactions between growth temperature as an example for environmental conditions and specific productivity could be revealed at a transcriptional level. reduction in temperature led to increased product secretion rates, which are the result of complex regulatory mechanisms and not only influenced by thermodynamic differences in protein folding. common transcriptional responses to reduced temperature such as induction of genes related to oxidative and osmotic stresses are overlapped by responses to recombinant protein production such as the upr and the erad. especially the enhanced transcription of components of the secretory pathway became obvious under conditions of higher protein secretion. it is tempting to speculate that at lower temperature a reduced amount of folding stress is imposed on the cells, consequently leading to a higher rate of correctly folded product.
