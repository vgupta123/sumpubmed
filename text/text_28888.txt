BACKGROUND
under field conditions, nitrogen nutrition is one of the major factors that influence plant growth  <cit> . the availability of this nutrient affects many processes of the plant, among which development, architecture, flowering, senescence, photosynthesis and photosynthates allocation  <cit> .

the low bio-availability of nitrogen in the pedosphere with respect to the request of the crops has spawned a dramatic increase in fertilization that has detrimental consequences on environment such as water eutrophication and increase in nh <dig> and n2o in the atmosphere  <cit> .

moreover, this side-effect is severe in the case of cereals, which account for 70% of food production worldwide. indeed, in these crops the grain yield is strictly correlated with n supply but the use efficiency is not higher than 50%  <cit> .

because of the economical relevance, the feasibility to combine extensive physiological, agronomic and genetic studies as well as the high metabolic efficiency of c <dig> plants, maize  was proposed as the model species to study n nutrition in cereals  <cit> .

among nitrogen inorganic molecules, nitrate is the predominant form in agricultural soils, where it can reach concentrations three or more orders of magnitude higher than in natural soils  <cit> .

in root cells, the uptake of this mineral nutrient involves inducible and constitutive transport systems  <cit> . both systems mediate the transport of the anion by h+ symport mechanisms  <cit>  sustained by h+-atpase  <cit> .

the first step of nitrate assimilation, that occurs in both roots and shoots, involves its reduction to ammonia by nitrate reductase  and nitrite reductase  enzymes, followed by transfer of ammonia to α-chetoglutaric acid by the action of glutamine synthetase  and glutamate synthase   <cit> . the pathway is induced in the presence of nitrate and shows many connections with other cellular traits, among which carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, redox status and ph homeostasis  <cit> . hence, nitrate and carbon metabolisms appear strictly linked and co- regulated, both locally and at long distance for the reciprocal root/leaf control, in response to the nutritional status of the plant and environmental stimuli  <cit> .

in the last years, some transcriptomic analyses have been conducted to shed light on the molecular basis of these regulatory mechanisms. wang and co-workers studied the transcriptomic changes occurring after exposure to low and high nitrate concentrations in whole plants of arabidopsis thaliana, by means of microarray and rna gel blot analysis  <cit> . besides the genes already known to be regulated by the presence of nitrate, the authors found new candidate genes encoding for regulatory proteins such as a myb transcription factor, a calcium antiporter, putative protein kinases and several metabolic enzymes. another study conducted by scheible and co-workers  <cit>  reports a comparative transcriptomic analysis of arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown in sterile liquid culture under nitrogen-limiting and nitrogen-replete conditions by using affymetrix ath <dig> arrays and -pcr. the authors observed that the response to nitrogen availability involved a deep reprogramming of primary and secondary metabolisms. these data well describe the complexity of nitrogen pathway as well as the direct and/or indirect consequences that nitrogen availability exerts on the whole metabolism of the plant.

starting from these results it should be now desirable to deepen the knowledge about the changes at translational and post-translational levels in response to nitrogen availability. in the last decade, the improvement in technologies for protein study and the widening of gene sequences made possible the study of the plant proteomes  <cit> .

in this context, the availability of a large est assembly and the efforts in sequencing maize genome  <cit>  contributed to improve the use of maize, as highlighted by a large number of studies conducted on this species, among which the proteomic characterizations of leaf  <cit> , of chloroplasts in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells  <cit>  and of pericycle cells of primary roots  <cit> .

at the present time, to the best of our knowledge no studies on nitrogen nutrition in maize were conducted by this approach. the only two proteomic works regarding this issue in cereals are based on the use of 2-de to compare the leaves  <cit>  and the roots  <cit>  of two wheat varieties exposed to different levels of nitrogen. these works pointed out some significant differences, correlated to n availability during the plant growth, in the protein profiles of both organs.

in order to obtain further information, in this work we investigated protein accumulation changes induced by nitrate in both roots and leaves of zea mays plants. the attention was focused on the changes in the pattern of protein soluble fractions caused by the addition of  <dig> mm nitrate to the hydroponic solution, after a period in which the plants were grown in the absence of nitrogen. firstly, the changes of some biochemical parameters were measured to describe the physiological response occurring after nitrate addition and were used to define the sampling time for proteomic analysis. these experiments led to compare the proteomes of plants previously grown for  <dig> days in absence of nitrogen and incubated for further  <dig> h without the nutrient or in the presence of  <dig> mm nitrate. through 2-de and lc-esi-ms/ms analyses a first characterization of the proteome changes occurring in maize plants in response to an increase in nitrate availability was obtained. the results show how many of these changes were related to enzymes of the nitrate assimilation or metabolic pathways strictly linked to it , but also reveal new proteins that may play a role in the nitrate responses.

RESULTS
experimental design and biochemical parameters
the aim of this work was to apply a proteomic approach to study the changes in protein patterns of root and leaf organs of maize plants in the first phase of exposure to high availability of nitrate, comparable to agricultural conditions, after a growth period under nitrogen starvation. this is a typical condition in which the addition of nitrate induces an increase in uptake and assimilation of this nutrient  <cit> .

the need for a simultaneous analysis of the root and the leaf organs of starved plants, with completely developed but not stressed leaf apparatus, led to the definition of the experimental design showed in figure  <dig>  briefly, seedlings were transferred into a hydroponic system after  <dig> days of germination and grown for further  <dig> days in a solution deprived of nitrogen. after that, at the beginning of the light period , some plants were maintained in the same nutritional condition  whereas others were transferred in a nutrient solution containing  <dig> mm no3- . in order to define the sampling time for proteomic analysis, the changes of biochemical parameters in response to no3- were firstly evaluated. roots and leaves were collected at t <dig> time and after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of nitrate exposure.

at these sampling times, the plants achieved the developmental stage corresponding to the complete expansion of the third leaf . the qualitative comparison between the c and n plants revealed some morphological differences. in particular, while the plants appeared very similar at the t <dig> sampling time, after  <dig> h the expansion of the fourth leaf was slightly more evident in n plants with respect to the c ones. this trend was more pronounced at  <dig> h and, only in c plants, was accompanied by the comparison of faint yellow areas in the leaf blades. in the tested conditions, no significant differences were observed in root system.

in order to characterize the physiological status of the plants, the changes in nitrate content and nr activity  as well as the levels of proteins, amino acids, reducing sugars, sucrose and chlorophyll were evaluated .

in roots and leaves of starved plants, both nitrate and nr activity were undetectable. after the addition of the nutrient to hydroponic solution the levels of nitrate progressively increased in plant tissues, reaching a level of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μmol of no3- g- <dig> fw after  <dig> h in roots and leaves respectively . a parallel dramatic increase of nr activity was measured until the 30th h of no3- exposure, while at the longest time considered  a decreased activity was observed . this trend was more evident in the roots in which a more rapid and large availability of nitrate took place. the total protein levels did not change significantly in all the conditions tested , while a sharp increase in free amino acids was detected in both organs after nitrate addition . moreover, the levels of amino acids were higher in the leaves than in the roots. although many factors are involved in the overall amino acid levels, these results may suggest a contribution of translocation of nitrogen compounds between the two organs. nitrate exposure also induced a decrease in reducing sugars in both organs , while only in the roots of the plants exposed for  <dig> h to  <dig> mm no3- a drop of sucrose took place .

taken together, these results well describe the induction trend of no3- assimilation pathway, as suggested by the increase of nr activity and amino acids accompanied by the consequent decrease of reducing sugars, the main source of carbon skeletons  <cit> . in roots, where photosynthesis cannot satisfy this request and/or the demand of carbon skeleton is high, sucrose pool was also affected. the changes in carbohydrate availability and the increase of amino acid levels also explain the decrease in nr activity observed in roots at the 54th h. in fact, these data are in agreement with the inhibitory effect on nr evocated by an increase of some amino acids, mainly asparagine and glutamine  <cit> . moreover, it is know that nr activity increases after sucrose addition whilst the low sugar content, condition that we observed in the roots of n plants, affects the nitrate reduction system  <cit> . the results suggested that this feedback mechanism was activated in roots of the plants exposed for  <dig> h to  <dig> mm no3-. finally, only at the 54th h, a significant decrease in chlorophyll content  was measured in the leaves of starved plants, thus suggesting that the first symptoms of stress were appearing.

2-de analysis and protein identification
the biochemical and physiological data showed that the plants incubated for the last  <dig> h in the presence of  <dig> mm no3- were in a condition in which nitrogen metabolism is completely activated in both root and leaf organs and that, at the same time, no stress symptoms were detectable in the control plants. starting from these results, the proteomic study was conducted by analyzing the soluble protein fractions extracted from roots and leaves of plants incubated for the last  <dig> h in the absence or in the presence of  <dig> mm no3-.

the ratio between dry and fresh weight as well as the total protein content appeared similar both in the roots and in the leaves of c and n samples . the adopted protocol permitted to obtain an extraction yield of soluble proteins of about 14% and 20% for roots and leaves, respectively. moreover, no significant differences were observed between c and n plants.

in the table, the fresh/dry weight , the content of total protein  and the % yield of the extraction of soluble proteins  for the roots and the leaves of the plants compared by proteomic analysis are reported. the fresh weight of the roots was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g in c and n plants, respectively. the fresh weight of the leaves was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g in c and n plants, respectively.

c plants: plants kept in the absence of nitrogen; n plants: plants grown for the last  <dig> h in the presence of  <dig> mm no3-. values are the mean ± se of three independent biological samples analyzed in triplicate .

the 2-de representative gels of the soluble fractions of root and leaf samples are shown in figure  <dig>  the electrophoretic analyses detected about  <dig> and  <dig> spots in roots and leaves gels, respectively. to ascertain the quantitative changes in the proteomic maps, the relative spot volumes  were evaluated by software-assisted analysis. the student's t-test , coupled with a threshold of two-fold change in the amount, revealed that  <dig> spots in roots and  <dig> spots in leaves were affected by nitrogen availability.

the analysis of these spots by lc-esi-ms/ms allowed to identify  <dig> and  <dig> proteins in root and leaf patterns, respectively. these proteins and the changes in their accumulation are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  while further information of mass spectrometry  analysis are reported in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig>

functional role and quantitative change of the proteins identified in roots
many of the spots identified in roots were enzymes involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolisms . according to the induction of the no3- assimilation pathway, in the roots of the plants incubated for the last  <dig> h in the presence of the nutrient, we observed an increase in the accumulation of nitrite reductase  and of glutamine synthetase plastidial isoform .

moreover, in response to the demand of carbon skeletons and nadph, which is used in non-green tissues for ferredoxin reduction  <cit> , an increase in the levels of phosphoglycerate mutase , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  and 6-phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase  took place. these results well agree with previous array data that describe the responses to nitrate exposure in arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> .

an increase in accumulation of the cytosolic isoform of glutamine synthetase  was also detected in roots of n plants. on the basis of identified peptides by ms analysis it was possible to discriminate among the  <dig> gs <dig> isoforms known in zea mays  and to restrict the possible identification to  <dig> of them . the fact that li and co-workers  <cit> , through a northern blot hybridization analysis, found that the transcript of gs1- <dig> gene was the only one expressed in roots, conducted to the specific identification of gs1- <dig> protein. moreover, sakakibara and co-workers  <cit>  showed that gs1- <dig> transcript was the only induced by no3-. the proteomic approach used in the present work allows to confirm these results at the translational level, demonstrating that in maize roots a cytosolic ammonia assimilation pathway can be activated also in response to nitrate.

other spots that were found to increase their relative volumes in response to nitrate were a non-symbiotic hemoglobin and a monodehydroascorbate reductase . in a previous work on arabidopsis, it was found that no3- induced athb <dig> and athb <dig>  two genes that encode for non-symbiotic hemoglobins  <cit> . scheible and co-workers  <cit>  suggested that these proteins could change their abundance in relation to the redox status, whereas wang and co-workers  <cit>  speculated on the possibility that the induction of hemoglobin could aim at reducing oxygen concentration during nr synthesis, since molybdenium can be sensitive to oxygen. besides, hemoglobin and mdhar are known to be involved in the scavenging of no that can be produced by cytosolic and/or plasmamembrane nitrate reductase when nitrite is used as substrate  <cit> . no is a signaling molecule which is involved in many biochemical and physiological processes  <cit> . it has been reported that in plant roots, no plays a role in growth, development and in some responses to environmental conditions, such as hypoxia  <cit> . recently, a possible involvement of no in the mediation of nitrate-dependent root growth in maize has been suggested  <cit> . according to this work, that describes a reduction of endogenous no at high external no3- concentration, the observed concomitant up-accumulation of hb <dig> and mdhar in our experimental condition supports the hypothesis that they might contribute in controlling no levels in root tissues after exposure to no3-  <cit> .

the last protein found to be present in higher amount in n plants was a pyruvate decarboxylase . this enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid into acetaldehyde, the first step of the alcoholic fermentation. in particular, we identified the pdc isoenzyme  <dig> that has been previously found to be induced in hypoxia condition  <cit> . although further studies are required to understand why pdc is induced by no3-, we can observe that fermentation pathways are induced in response to redox status changes and that this condition could be also linked to the activation of the hb/no cycle   <cit> .

among the spots identified in roots, six showed a down-accumulation in n plants . three of them were identified as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase . the ms analysis indicated for all three spots the same protein  while the electrophoretic data showed some differences in mr and pi, suggesting that post-translational modification events may have occurred. it has been shown as low nitrogen availability induces transcripts encoding enzymes of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolism, such as pal, chalcone synthase and 4-coumarate:coenzyme a ligase, whilst after nitrogen repletion these activities are down-regulated  <cit> . our proteomic data appear to be in agreement with these studies.

previously, it was found that under low nitrogen availability four proteases  increased their activity to degrade non-essential proteins in order to remobilize this nutrient  <cit> . in this work, we found an aspartic protease belonging to the a <dig> family  that was down-regulated after no3- exposure. moreover, the experimental mr appeared lower with respect to that expected for this protein, thus suggesting that this spot is referable to the active form of the enzyme  <cit> . these data support a new possible role for a <dig> protease family  <cit> .

phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity is known to increase during nitrate assimilation, having a role in cell ph homeostasis and an anaplerotic function  <cit> . in addition, the monoubiquitination of this enzyme was recently well described in germinating castor oil seeds by uhrig and co-workers  <cit> . it was found that this event is non-destructive and that this reversible post-translational modification of the enzyme reduces its affinity for pep and its sensitivity to allosteric activators and inhibitors. the ms analysis of spot  <dig>  identified  <dig> peptides,  <dig> of which matched with a pepcase  , while the last peptide belonged to an ubiquitin   . the experimental mr and pi of spot  <dig>  that were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, were in agreement with the monoubiquitination of the pepcase . moreover, the domain responsible to bind ubiquitin previously identified in pepcase of other vascular plants is present in this maize pepcase  <cit> . these results suggest that in maize roots the modulation of pepcase activity in response to nitrogen availability could occur also through reversible monoubiquitination.

the last spot identified in roots that was down-regulated by no3- was the 14-3-3-like protein gf14- <dig> . previously, it was found that this protein is localized in the nucleus where it binds the dna at the g-box regions in association with transcription factors and that it is involved in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . more recently, it was described an interaction of 14-3- <dig> proteins with some transcription factors such as vp <dig>  embp <dig>  tbp and tfiib  <cit> . further studies are required to clarify the effective role of gf14- <dig>  for which the functional information are still lacking.

functional role and quantitative change of the proteins identified in leaves
many of the spots identified in leaves by lc-esi-ms/ms analysis were proteins linked to the no3- assimilation as well as to the photosynthetic activity .

the activity of nr can be modulated also at post-translational level through a phosphorylation event followed by binding of inhibitory 14-3- <dig> protein  <cit> . one of the spots analyzed in the leaves was identified as tawin <dig> , that was previously described to be involved in the nr inactivation  <cit> . we found that the level of this protein decreased in leaves of n plants, where nr activity was induced .

according to the well known relationships existing between nitrogen and carbon metabolism, the changes in accumulation of some spots after no3- addition are consistent with an increase of photosynthesis rate. two spots that raise after no3- addition were identified as cpn-60α and cpn-60β , that are chaperonin proteins involved in folding of ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase  <cit> . moreover, a chloroplastic triosephosphate isomerase was up-regulated by no3- , while a cytosolic 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  was down-regulated, as expected when the request of reducing power could be satisfied by the increase in photosynthetic activity  <cit> .

spot  <dig> was identified as the α subunit of the chloroplastic atp synthase , but unexpectedly it was more abundant in leaves of c plants. although only a speculative interpretation of this result can be made, we could hypothesize that in leaves of the n plants atp synthase should be activated and this process requires the reconstitution of the enzymatic complex in the thylakoid membranes  <cit> . hence, to clarify this point, it should be necessary to investigate if the decrease of atpsyn α observed in the soluble fraction of n plants is effectively accompanied by an increase of this protein in the membrane fraction.

thiamine  is required in many pathways, such as the calvin cycle, the branched-chain amino acid pathway and pigment biosynthesis  <cit> . along with higher request of this vitamin in leaves of n plants, where the activation of these pathways could take place, we identified, among the spots up-regulated by n, the thiazole biosynthetic enzyme  that is known to be involved in thiamine biosynthesis  <cit> .

two spots were identified as pepcase . in c <dig> plants such as maize, this enzyme plays a central role in photosynthesis, because it catalyses the primary fixation of atmospheric co <dig>  <cit> . the catalytic activity and sensitivity of this enzyme are mediated by a reversible phosphorylation  <cit> . the experimental pis of the spots  <dig> and  <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. moreover, these two pepcase forms showed opposite changes in abundance in the leaves of plants grown in the last  <dig> h in the presence of no3- with respect to the controls. the results obtained in our work suggest that the two spots of pepcase are referable to the phosphorylated  and to the unphosphorylated  form with a predicted pi of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, that are known to correspond to the more and less active states of this enzyme  <cit> . interestingly, despite the fact that data suggest an increase in the photosynthetic activity, the phosphorylated form was more abundant in the proteomic map of c plants. these results support the immunological observation by ueno and co-workers  <cit>  that the diurnal regulation of phosphorylation state of pepcase appears delayed in nitrogen-limited conditions, suggesting that the circadian control of pepcase is affected by nitrogen starvation.

two of the spots down-regulated in leaves of n plants were a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  and a methionine synthase . the decrease of pal, observed also in root tissue , is a further evidence that phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolisms are affected by nitrogen availability  <cit> . on the other hand, the change in accumulation of mets is contrasting with a recent proteomic study performed on wheat by bahrman and co-workers  <cit> . these authors found that the induction of this enzyme was positively related to nitrogen availability. this discrepancy could be associated to different genetic traits of the two species, as well as it could be linked to different experimental approaches adopted in the two studies. nevertheless, it should be observed that in both these works a single spot referable to mets was detected, while further information on total level and/or on activity of this enzyme is necessary to clarify this point.

the spot  <dig>  which considerably increased in n plants, was a lipoxygenase . in particular, the analysis of the ms spectra identified the lox codified by zmlox <dig> gene, which was found to be a plastidic type  <dig> linoleate 13-lox  <cit> . the expression analysis of this gene revealed that its transcript was abundant in leaves and was regulated by a circadian rhythm with a trend strictly linked to the photosynthetic activity. moreover, it has been proposed that zmlox <dig> is involved in the hydroperoxide lyase-mediated production of c6-aldehydes and alcohols and not in the biosynthesis of ja  <cit> . although some evidences suggest a role of zmlox <dig> in the responses to biotic stresses, its involvement in the diurnal lipid metabolism was also proposed  <cit> .

at the same time, we identified two proteins as an oxygen-evolving enhancer protein  <dig>  and a  <dig> kda polypeptide of photosystem ii , which were down-accumulated in leaves of n plants . both have been classified as members of psbp family that is one of the three extrinsic protein families composing the oxygen-evolving complex  of photosystem ii in higher plants  <cit> . in addition, it was recently demonstrated that psbp proteins are essential for the normal function of psii and play a crucial role in stabilizing the mn cluster in vivo  <cit> . moreover, the stability of this class of protein seems related to the lipid composition of chloroplastic membranes that is also affected by nitrogen availability  <cit> .

in order to elucidate the physiological meaning of these variations and to verify if they could be related to a stress status or to an alteration in photosynthetic performance, changes of both maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii  and effective quantum yield of photosystem ii , dry weight and mda levels of shoot were measured . although the fv/fm parameter, measured on over-night dark adapted plants at time points  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours, resulted in very similar values between c and n plants , the Φii values showed a very slight decrease in c plants during the second period of illumination  and the difference became more marked between  <dig> and  <dig> hours of nitrogen starvation. similar data could be obtained by monitoring biomass production at the different time points , indicating that photosynthetic performances are highly impaired in c plants after 48– <dig> hours of treatment. nevertheless, no changes in mda were detected in all the conditions tested .

taken together these results indicate that at the 30th h, the time point chosen for proteomic analysis, plants start feeling the different nitrogen content in the growth media without developing major stress symptoms and the associated pleiotropic effects.

these data sustain the hypothesis that zmlox <dig> could be involved in lipid metabolism of the chloroplast that is strictly depending on photosynthetic activity  <cit> . further analyses are needed to unravel this possible intriguing role of zmlox <dig> 

considering the psbp proteins, the change in accumulation of oee <dig> and 23ppsii could indicate that oec stability is affected by the n availability. through time-course experiments, it will be possible to better correlate the relationship among n nutritional status, lipid metabolism, psbp protein levels and psii functionality.

CONCLUSIONS
many of the proteins found to change in accumulation in response to no3- were directly involved in the assimilation of this mineral nutrient. moreover, the results underline the strict relationship between nitrogen and carbon metabolisms. the experimental design chosen for this proteomic study allows to emphasize some intriguing metabolic activities in both organs. besides a dramatic increase of no3- assimilation pathway, the exposure to a high no3- concentration after a starvation period seems to induce a modification in no metabolism in roots, that could depend on the need of responding to the new nutritional status. in leaves, many proteins were found to be directly involved in the photosynthesis reactivation and in the maintenance of the chloroplastic functionality.

in addition, this proteomic analysis confirms the modulation by phosphorylation of the pepcase in the leaves, suggesting that nitrogen availability could affect the circadian rhythms, as well as it shows that the form of this enzyme operating in roots could be modulated by monoubiquitination. although further efforts are required to elucidate these results, the present study underlines the central role of post-translational events to modulate pivotal enzymes in plant metabolic response to no3-.
