BACKGROUND
renal cell carcinoma  is the most common type of kidney cancer , which causes ~3 % deaths in men in the united states every year  <cit> . rcc can be classified into four clinical subtypes including clear cell renal cell carcinoma , papillary rcc , chromophobe rcc , and renal oncocytoma . among them, ccrcc is the most common type representing 75–85 % of all rcc cases  <cit> . unlike other cancer types that are found to have recurrent mutations in oncogenes , ccrcc tumors are mainly associated with somatic mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as vhl, pbrm <dig>  bap <dig> and setd <dig> .

pbrm <dig> , which maps to 3p <dig>  plays an atp-dependent chromatin-remodeling role as a subunit of the swi/snf  complex . pbrm <dig> is found to mediate gene regulation of cell growth, migration, proliferation and differentiation in multiple cancer types including kidney, bladder, and breast. among these cancer types, pbrm <dig> is one of the most frequently mutated and studied genes in ccrcc than any other cancer types . in ccrcc, pbrm <dig> is the second most frequently mutated gene; it is observed in ~40 % of tumor cases and functions as a driver tumor suppressor gene . pbrm <dig> mutations in ccrcc samples may lead to a dysregulation of several critical cell signaling pathways including actin-based motility by rho, tight junction signaling, axonal guidance signaling and germ cell-sertoli cell junction signaling  <cit> . furthermore, mutations in pbrm <dig> are identified as the root of tumor evolution in a subgroup of ccrcc  <cit> . while previous studies have focused on the exploration of particular downstream genes and pathways directly regulated by pbrm <dig> gene, an in-depth integrative analysis on the biological consequences of pbrm <dig> truncated mutations has not been done yet. such an analysis is important because tumor suppressor genes play function largely through truncated mutations  <cit> .

here, we performed an integrative genomics analysis to investigate the biological consequences of truncated pbrm <dig> mutations in ccrcc. we downloaded multiple -omics data including rna-seq, dna methylation, and microrna-seq data of ccrcc samples from the cancer genome atlas . we systemically compared molecular features in a total of  <dig> mutated pbrm <dig> samples with those in  <dig> “pan-negative” samples; and those samples were all exclusive of any of the five known ccrcc driver genes   <cit> . the approach allowed us to maximally reduce the noise from the observed molecular signals. we identified a substantial proportion of molecular alterations including changes in gene expression, dna methylation, and dysregulation of micrornas  that were significantly associated with truncated pbrm <dig> mutations, as well as the follow up pathway, co-expression network, and hypothesized mechanism analysis.

RESULTS
workflow for defining pbrm1-mutated and “pan-negative” sample groups
somatic mutation profiles for  <dig> tumor samples in ccrcc, or kidney renal clear cell carcinoma , were downloaded from tcga . after examining pbrm <dig> mutations, we separated samples into two groups including  <dig> mutated pbrm <dig> samples and  <dig> non-mutated pbrm <dig> samples, respectively   <cit> . we further excluded a total of  <dig> and  <dig> samples for downstream analysis because they carried mutations in five high-confidence ccrcc driver genes   <cit> . this process resulted in  <dig> pbrm <dig> mutated samples and  <dig> “pan-negative” samples, respectively . in the next step, we identified the samples with matched rna-seq, dna methylation, and microrna-seq data; this resulted in a total of  <dig> mutated pbrm <dig> samples and  <dig> “pan-negative” samples. they were used for the analyses for downstream pre-transcriptional and transcriptional events . importantly, those  <dig> samples carried “loss of function” mutations in pbrm <dig> gene, including five nonsense mutations, three splice sites mutations and three frame shift deletions .fig.  <dig> sample filtering workflow used for integrative genomic analyses and differential expression results by comparing  <dig> pbrm <dig> mutated and  <dig> “pan-negative” ccrcc samples. a a sample filtering workflow was used for integrative genomic analyses. first,  <dig> ccrcc samples were split into pbrm <dig> mutated group  and pbrm <dig> non-mutated group . five high-confidence ccrcc driver genes  were excluded in both groups, resulting in  <dig> pbrm <dig> mutated samples and  <dig> “pan-negative” samples. after that, samples that have all dna methylation, rna-seq, and mirna-seq data were extracted; resulting in  <dig> pbrm <dig> mutated samples and  <dig> “pan-negative” samples for further in-depth integrative analysis. b cartoon representation of mutation types and locations in  <dig> pbrm <dig> truncation mutated samples. five nonsense mutations , three splice sites mutations , and three frame shift deletions  were observed in  <dig> pbrm <dig> truncated mutation samples. c volcano plot of significance of gene expression difference between pbrm <dig> mutated group and “pan-negative” group at gene expression levels. each dot represents one gene. the x axis shows the gene expression difference by a log transformed fold change while the y axis shows significance by –log <dig> transformed p-value value obtained from edger. a gene is called significantly and differentially expressed if its |log| >  <dig> and p-value <  <dig> . red dashed line shows |log| = <dig> or p-value =  <dig> . d bar plot of log transfer of fold change in differentially expressed transcriptional factors.  <dig> transcriptional factors were found to be down-regulated in pbrm <dig> mutated group while three transcriptional factors were found up-regulated



identification of transcriptional factors from differentially expressed genes associated with pbrm <dig> truncated mutations
we performed a comparative analysis on gene expression profiles to identify the differential expressed genes  between the pbrm <dig> mutated group and “pan-negative” group using edger  <cit> . at a significance threshold of absolute log <dig> transferred fold change  >  <dig> and p <  <dig> , a total of  <dig> degs were identified including  <dig> genes having over expression and  <dig> genes showing lower expression in pbrm <dig> mutated samples compared with the “pan-negative” group . of those degs,  <dig> transcription factors were observed,  <dig> were down-regulated but only three were up-regulated . interestingly, four antp homeobox family and two forkhead family transcriptional factors  that are involved in cell development and proliferation  <cit>  were found to be down-regulated in the pbrm <dig> mutated group versus “pan-negative” group. additionally, gata <dig>  a transcription factor that was observed to be down-regulated in pbrm <dig> mutated group in our study, was previously found to be an important early event and potential regulator that associated with loss of tgfβ receptor expression in ccrcc  <cit>  . gene function enrichment analysis showed that down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in extracellular matrix organization , cell adhesion  and ion transport , while up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in pathway-restricted smad protein phosphorylation  . we further examined gene expression and methylation, as hypo-methylation is often related to active transcription and gene expression. our examination the relationship between lower expressed genes and hyper-methylated genes showed that  <dig> down-regulated genes were hyper-methylated , including bcat <dig> associated with cell growth, hoxb <dig> encoding a cell cycle regulation transcription factor, and pax <dig> encoding a cellular development associated transcription factor   <cit> .fig.  <dig> functional enrichment results of differentially expressed genes from rna-seq of pbrm <dig> mutation ccrcc samples. a clustered function and pathway enrichment results of up-regulated genes in pbrm <dig> mutated group compared with “pan-negative” group, with p-value <  <dig>  results shown. different clusters were shown in different colors. b clustered function and pathway enrichment results of down-regulated genes in pbrm <dig> mutated group compared with “pan-negative” group, with p-value <  <dig>  results shown. different clusters were shown in different colors



widespread epigenetic silencing associated with pbrm <dig> truncated mutations
we analyzed genome-scale dna methylation profiles by comparing β-value changes  between mutated pbrm <dig> group and “pan-negative” group . a total of  <dig> differentially methylated genes covering  <dig> differentially methylated cpg sites were identified using |β-difference| >  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  cutoff . among those genes,  <dig> hyper-methylated  and  <dig> hypo-methylated genes  were observed in pbrm <dig> mutated samples compared to the “pan-negative” samples, suggesting that an global gene inactivation may be associated with pbrm <dig> truncated mutations . this observation is consistent with the differential gene expression results above ; however, these genes may not be immediately regulated by pbrm <dig> because truncated mutations in a tumor suppressor gene are expected to result in up-regulation of its immediately regulated gene according to the “loss of function” model. functional enrichment analyses indicated that those hyper-methylated genes were significantly enriched in multiple processes including generation of neurons , cell differentiation , and regulation of catabolic process , while glomerulus development was observed to be most significant in hypo-methylated genes  . interestingly, we found that hyper-methylated cpg sites exhibited a significantly higher proportion residing in several gene regions including promoters and gene bodies than hypo-methylated genes   <cit> .fig.  <dig> methylation pattern and mirna expression pattern in pbrm <dig> mutated ccrcc a volcano plot of significance of dna methylation pattern difference  between pbrm <dig> mutated group and “pan-negative” group. each dot represents one methylation probes. the x axis shows the difference in β-value  while the y axis shows the significance by –log transformed p-value obtained from samr. a probe is called significantly and differentially expressed if its |β-difference| >  <dig>  and p-value <  <dig> . the red dashed line shows |β-difference| = <dig>  or p-value =  <dig> . b heat map of differential expressed methylation probes between pbrm <dig> mutated group and “pan-negative” group. c volcano plot of significance of mirna expression differences between pbrm <dig> mutated group and “pan-negative” group. each dot represents one mirna. the x axis shows log transformed fold changes of mirna expression while the y axis shows significance by –log <dig> transformed p-value obtained from edger. a probe is called significantly and differentially expressed if its |log| >  <dig> and p-value <  <dig> . red dashed line |log| = <dig> or p-value =  <dig> . d bar plot of top ten up-regulated mirnas and down-regulated mirnas that revealed in pbrm <dig> mutated samples compared with “pan-negative” ccrcc samples



mirna dysregulation associated with pbrm <dig> truncation mutations
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were identified to be associated with pbrm <dig> truncation mutations using the cutoffs: absolute log <dig> transferred fold change  >  <dig> and p <  <dig> . among them,  <dig> mirnas exhibited up-regulation pattern in pbrm <dig> mutated samples while the remaining  <dig> mirnas exhibited down-regulation pattern . the  <dig> most differentially expressed mirnas were shown in fig. 3d. interestingly, three identified mirnas  exhibiting down-regulation patterns in pbrm <dig> mutated group were consistent with the previous reports by experimental studies  <cit> . next, we performed the analysis of those predicted targets genes that may be regulated by these differentially expressed mirnas. among the differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig> up-regulated mirnas and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas had targets in tarbase  <cit>  or mirtarbase  <cit>  database. we observed  <dig> and  <dig> target genes for up-regulated mirnas and down-regulated mirnas, respectively. comparisons between mirna targets and degs revealed that  <dig> mirna target genes were up-regulated while  <dig> were down-regulated, in which nine mirna target genes were hyper-methylated and also down-regulated in pbrm <dig> mutated group . functional enrichment analysis revealed that  <dig> functional terms and pathways, including extracellular matrix organization and extracellular structure organization pathways, were observed in more than one gene set; and these gene sets are differentially expressed genes, differentially methylated genes, and differential expressed mirna targets genes .fig.  <dig> integrative analysis results of function terms and pathway enrichment. a venn representation of the overlaps among up-regulated genes , down-regulated genes , target genes of up-regulated mirnas  and target genes of down-regulated mirnas . b venn representation of overlaps among function and pathway enrichment results from differential methylated genes , differential expressed genes  and targets genes of differential expressed mirna 



integrated analysis for pbrm <dig> truncated mutations in ccrcc
to further explore the regulatory mechanisms of the identified genes and mirnas associated with pbrm <dig> truncated mutations in ccrcc, we constructed co-expression networks using r software based on mrna expression results . to identify mirnas that involved in gene co-expression networks, mirnas target genes that were found co-expressed with other genes and corresponding mirnas were also included in co-expression networks. six mirnas  were observed in both up-regulated and down-regulated co-expression networks, in which different possible targets were involved. the mirna target genes including slc39a <dig> and egr <dig> that are related to ion transport and cell growth were observed in the pbrm1-specific up-regulated co-expression network, suggesting that mirnas may be involved in ion transport and a cell growth process in pbrm1-driven dysregulation. in the pbrm <dig> specific down-regulated co-expression network, two down-regulated dna-binding transcription factors hoxb <dig> and pax <dig> were observed as positively co-expressed with several genes and regulated by mirnas, suggesting their essential role in pbrm1-related down-regulation . similarly, sdcbp <dig> and pax <dig> were found to be positively co-expressed with many genes in the down-regulated co-expression network , which further verified the association of compound metabolisms and development with pbrm <dig> truncation mutations  <cit> .fig.  <dig> 
pbrm <dig> mutation specific, up-regulated and down-regulated co-expression network. highly co-expressed genes in pbrm <dig> mutated groups were mapped into a protein-protein interaction network from pina <dig>  as reference network.  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> hyper-down  genes were mapped into the reference network, as up-regulated co-expression network  and down-regulated core co-expression network. b in down-regulated core co-expression network, only first neighbors of  <dig> hyper-down genes in down-regulated genes were kept in network. in both networks, only genes with degree above there were kept for better version



collectively, pbrm <dig> truncated mutations may lead to the pre-transcriptional deregulation at dna methylation level and the post-transcriptional deregulation at the mirna expression level. accordingly, this resulted in widespread hyper-methylation and mirna expression alteration in ccrcc tumor genomes . based on our integrative genomic analysis results, we proposed the possible regulations linked to the pbrm <dig> truncated mutations in the tumorigenesis of ccrcc . these functional alterations include both up-regulation and down-regulation of molecules and pathways that are associated with the mirna and methylation changes in pbrm1-truncated mutation tumor cells.fig.  <dig> hypothesized mechanisms of pbrm <dig> truncated mutation functions in the tumor genetics of ccrcc. hyper-methylation and altered mirnas expression were found associated with pbrm <dig> truncated mutation in ccrcc. up-regulated genes and pathways were shown in red  while down-regulated genes and pathways were shown in blue 



discussion
this study highlights the association between pbrm <dig> truncated mutations and decreased extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, ion transport and tissue development. this suggests that pbrm <dig> plays an important regulatory role in cell-cell crosstalk in the tumorigenesis of ccrcc. in this study, there are more differentially methylated genes  than differential expressed genes  in pbrm <dig> mutated group, suggesting a complicated pre-transcriptional level regulation with dna methylation involved in pbrm <dig> mutations.

studying the downstream events of a driver gene has become important now because the scientific community has witnessed large amount of genomic data allowing the sample stratification by driver mutation and also because a driver gene may lead to many critical biological events linking to tumorigenesis or drug treatment  <cit> . we recently develop approaches to study the downstream events of a specific mutation in a driver gene  in melanoma  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate pre-transcriptional and post-transcriptional level data to investigate the main effects of a driver gene  through its truncated mutations in a cancer . observations in this study are based on  <dig> pbrm <dig> mutated and  <dig> “pan-negative” ccrcc samples, which may have some bias because of the small sample size. however, by an integrative analysis of multiple -omics data, we could still achieve reliable results for further validation. as we did similarly in melanoma  <cit> , the stratification of samples by driver mutation only  and “pan-negative” samples  would likely increase the power because it effectively removed the noise from similar samples with other driver mutations. this is especially important in cancer genomics studies because driver mutations may affect the same or similar signaling pathways . our results suggest that pbrm <dig> mutations are an important event in the early stage of ccrcc tumor genetics, which paves the way for further pbrm1-related research in ccrcc. to excluded the influences of other driver genes and highlight the effects of pbrm <dig> in ccrcc, we defined the “pan-negative” ccrcc sample set by excluding samples that contained somatic mutations in any of the five well-known driver genes in ccrcc. future validation may apply the similar strategies. our integrative analysis using methylation, gene expression, and mirna expression is the first to study the pbrm <dig> truncation mutation specific dysfunction in co-expressed networks. all mutations in  <dig> pbrm <dig> mutated samples are truncation mutations, which signify dysfunction state of pbrm <dig> as a tumor suppressor gene in ccrcc.

there are several limitations in this study. first, how our results are related to the influence of pbrm <dig> on tumor prognosis needs further investigation because previous studies suggest the association between pbrm <dig> mutations and prognosis of ccrcc is still unclear  <cit> . in addition, copy number variants of pbrm <dig> are not considered either since we only focus on the downstream consequences that associate with early somatic mutation events in pbrm <dig>  no validation cohorts of pbrm <dig> have involved in this study yet because of the limited results available related to pbrm <dig> at the current stage. we hope more reports will become available from other groups in the near future so that our results may be experimentally validated. our analysis focuses on the gene level changes that associated with pbrm <dig> truncated mutation, in which protein level changes were not considered because of the complicated regulation from gene expression level to protein level.

pbrm <dig> is found to be highly mutated in several cancer types. it is most frequently mutated in ccrcc. loss of function and expression of pbrm <dig> was less common in non-ccrcc than in ccrcc, suggesting a specific regulatory role of pbrm <dig> truncation mutations in ccrcc  <cit> . in breast cancer, pbrm <dig> is shown to be a core regulator of p <dig>  <cit> ; however, we could not find a similar pattern in ccrcc. the result suggests that pbrm <dig> may act differently through its regulation mechanisms in different cancer types. future studies to dissect the role of pbrm <dig> in different cancer types would be helpful to better understand the mechanisms of pbrm <dig> truncation mutations and tumorigenesis. more cancer genomic data is expected from large consortia like the international cancer genome consortium . so, a follow up study is needed in future.

CONCLUSIONS
our study investigated molecular alterations including gene expression, methylation, and mirna expression that associated with pbrm <dig> truncation mutations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. our analysis results identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> differentially methylated genes and  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas between pbrm <dig> mutated group and “pan-negative” group. hypothesized mechanisms of pbrm <dig> mutations in ccrcc were explored based on the integrative analysis results. our results provide some important insights into the pbrm <dig> regulation in the tumor development of ccrcc.
