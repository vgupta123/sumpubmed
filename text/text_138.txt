BACKGROUND
the ap2/erf superfamily is one of the largest groups of transcription factors in plants  <cit> . it includes all genes coding for at least one apetala <dig>  domain and can be further separated into the ethylene response factor , the ap <dig>  and the rav families. the ap <dig> domain, which is responsible for dna binding, was named after the arabidopsis thaliana apetala <dig> protein identified by jofuku et al.  <cit> . subsequently, tobacco  transcription factors containing a motif related to the ap <dig> domain were also identified  <cit> . since these proteins are able to bind an ethylene responsive dna element , they were classified as erfs  and their dna binding domain was named after them  <cit> .

the subdivision of the ap2/erf group into families is based on the number of ap <dig> domains present in the proteins, together with the presence of other dna binding domains. the ap <dig> family contains proteins with a double, tandem repeated, ap <dig> domain  <cit> . the erf family genes code for transcription factors with a single ap <dig> domain. lastly, the rav family encodes proteins possessing a single ap <dig> domain plus an additional b <dig> domain, which is also present in other, non-erf transcription factors  <cit> .

two major efforts to define a nomenclature for erf sequences have been published. sakuma et al.  <cit>  divided the arabidopsis erf family into two subfamilies based on the amino acid sequence of the dna binding domain: the cbf/dreb subfamily  and the erf-like subfamily , both further subdivided in six groups. nakano et al.  <cit>  on the other hand, proposed an innovative classification for arabidopsis erfs, based on the amino acid sequence of the whole proteins, splitting the family into ten groups.

despite the relatively high sequence conservation of the ap2/erf domain, the number of dna elements bound by different ap2/erf transcription factors is extremely wide .

the dreb group interacts with the core sequence ccgac  <cit> , while the erf group typically binds to an agccgcc sequence, called gcc box  <cit> .

in the ap <dig> family, a binding element gcacntcccang has been reported for the protein aintegumenta   <cit> , and the same sequence was shown to be bound by five other ap <dig> members  <cit> . this dna element is quite distinct from the consensus sequence ccga/cc bound by the dreb/erf group and, surprisingly, is not composed of two similar half sites, since the ap <dig> proteins contain a double ap <dig> domain  <cit> .

ap2/erf transcription factors regulate a number of biological processes including development, reproduction, responses to hormones, adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit>  and  <cit> .

after the release of the whole genomic sequences of several plant organisms, including arabidopsis, rice  and poplar , the ap2/erf transcription factor superfamily was analyzed, both to place each member in an organized nomenclature system, and to provide maps of their expression. to date, two full genome sequences of highly homozygous and heterozygous grapevine  pinot noir genotypes have been carried out . these two milestones provided a useful genomic platform to study this fruit crop. as ap2/erf transcription factors are involved in flower development and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, their superfamily represents one of the best pools to investigate, when searching for important grapevine traits. since genome scale analyses of the transcriptional response to the development and environmental stimuli require a precise and complete annotation in order to provide reliable and exhaustive data, we decided to annotate the erf family members and create a qrt-pcr platform that allows investigating their expression profile.

a recent study suggested that  <dig> genes encoding ap2/erf proteins are present in the grapevine genome  <cit> . however, a higher number of ap2/erf genes is present in arabidopsis and poplar genomes . we therefore re-screened the grapevine genome for ap2/erf sequences, adopting two different strategies, in order to accurately identify ap2/erf-like sequences in the vitis vinifera genome. in this study we provide a characterization of the grapevine ap2/erf transcription factor superfamily and demonstrate that it is in fact composed of almost  <dig> genes. moreover, using qrt-pcr platform encompassing the whole erf/ap <dig> superfamily, we show how ap2/erf-like genes are expressed in both vegetative and reproductive tissues at different developmental stages, and we infer roles and putative targets for some of these genes. overall, our analysis suggests that ap2/erf proteins play a strong role in ripening-related processes.

RESULTS
identification of the ap2/erf family transcription factors in vitis vinifera
as result of an extensive search for ap2-domain containing proteins,  <dig> distinct ap2/erf putative tfs were identified . one hundred and twenty two genes encoding for proteins with a single ap2/erf domain were assigned to the erf superfamily. the ap <dig> family was grouped into  <dig> genes, that could be identified due to the tandem repeated double ap2/erf motif. six genes, containing a single ap2/erf dna binding domain together with a b <dig> type domain, were assigned to the rav family. a single ap <dig> protein, gidvvp <dig>  showed a low similarity to the other erf sequences although it is homologous to the arabidopsis erf transcription factor at4g <dig>  a similar gene has also been identified in p. trichocarpa and named soloist  <cit> . surprisingly, the vitis gene annotated as soloist in the grapevine genome by zhuang et al.  <cit>  is not homologous to the poplar soloist. zhuang et al.  <cit>  named protein sequence gsvivp <dig> as soloist, although its similarity to the sequences of arabidopsis at4g <dig> and ptsoloist is rather low. on the other hand, gidvvp <dig> is the closest homolog of both at4g <dig> and ptsoloist in the grapevine genome .

previous annotations of ap2/erf genes in poplar  <cit>  and grapevine  <cit>  followed the nomenclature proposed by sakuma et al.  <cit> , based on a homology of the dna binding domain alone. however, nakano et al.  <cit>  proposed an alternative method, based on the presence of domains that were different from the dna binding domain. therefore we subdivided the grapevine erf genes into  <dig> groups, according to their similarity to the arabidopsis erf sequences. amino acid motifs located outside the dna binding domain are conserved among the arabidopsis  <cit>  and vitis erf proteins .

taken as a whole, the erf/ap <dig> superfamily has a similar number of genes in grapevine  and arabidopsis , while it is bigger in poplar  and rice . the number of rav genes is highly conserved among species with six members in dicots and five genes in rice. the ap <dig> family encompasses a similar number of genes in v. vinifera  and a. thaliana , while this increases to  <dig> in poplar and  <dig> in rice . the soloist protein, coded by a single-copy gene and characterized by a low conservation at the erf dna-binding domain, was present in all the plant genomes considered. although the overall number of sequences belonging to the erf family was conserved in grapevine and arabidopsis, noteworthy differences existed between groups . group iii, viii and x had a very similar number of genes . on the other hand, groups ii, iv, vi, vii, and vi-l in vitis vinifera contained half the number of members than arabidopsis . the opposite trend was observed for groups v and ix, where the number of members was more than double compared to arabidopsis. interestingly, in the poplar genome, group ix and v genes were also more than the twice their arabidopsis counterparts. the poplar genome appeared to have a higher number of erf genes in most of the groups. erf proteins belonging to the xb-like group were not found in the grapevine genome.

number of genes present in each family and group within the ap2/erf superfamily in the plant species whose genome has been fully sequenced. a comparison of group and family-size between the grapevine ap2/erf sequences identified in this study and those present in the rice, poplar, arabidopsis transcription factor databases are provided as ratios.

accuracy of protein predictions
proteins sequences from the genoscope database have been deduced using an automated method  <cit> . however, this methodology is prone to errors  <cit> . we found similar issues in grapevine predictions. in fact, some gene annotations and intron junctions did not match those of the arabidopsis and poplar homologs. we found unrealistic introns of  <dig>  and  <dig> kb predicted in gsvivp <dig> and in gsvivt <dig> gene models respectively. moreover the gene models gsvivt <dig>  gsvivp <dig>  gsvivt <dig>  and gsvivp <dig> were predicted to encode proteins that contained two or more erf domains. since both of these sequences were homologous to arabidopsis proteins belonging to the erf family and not to the ap <dig> family, we decided to split each gene model into sequences encoding a single erf domain protein, using the closest arabidopsis protein as a template . in order to test whether the prediction of these dubious genes was correct, we compared the production of amplicons corresponding to single exons with that of the predicted cdna derived from exon-joining. the absence of an amplicon that corresponded to exon joining, together with the correct amplification of the single exon, was interpreted as an indication of misprediction. the gene model gsvivt <dig>  which is supported by cdna report evidence, was used as a positive control. no amplification was obtained using primers annealing to the n- and c- terminus of gsvivt <dig>  gsvivt <dig> and gsvivt <dig>  although an amplicon of the expected size was obtained using primers that anneal within the exons . since the present results revealed the possibility that other gene structure predictions were partly incorrect, all dubious sequences were checked and, where necessary, corrected, using arabidopsis and poplar closest homologs as templates .

phylogenetic analysis
in order to investigate the evolutionary relatedness of the identified sequences, together with the erf genes encoded by the other fully sequenced plant species, we performed a sequence-based phylogenetic analysis.

the resulting phylogenetic tree  shows  <dig> clades, which correspond, according to sakuma et al.  <cit>  and nakano et al.  <cit> , to the erf, the ap <dig> and the rav superfamilies. the erf superfamily is subdivided into  <dig> clades, which correspond to the group i-x as described by nakano et al.  <cit> . although the vvsoloist transcription factor contains a single ap <dig> domain, it clusters together with the ap <dig> superfamily. zhuang et al.  <cit>  identified two recent duplication events in the grapevine genome: one occurring for members of the b <dig> group  and the second in the dreb group . however, we did not find a perfect identity between vverf <dig> and vverf <dig> . instead, we identified  <dig> genes encoding for erf-ix proteins characterized by a high sequence similarity . four of these genes  maintained a high sequence similarity at a nucleotide level, outside the coding sequence approximately  <dig> downstream and  <dig> bp upstream .

chromosome position of the identified vitis vinifera ap2/erf genes
the ap2/erf genes were distributed unevenly among the nineteen chromosomes of the grapevine genome . thirteen genes could not be assigned to any specific chromosome. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> appeared to contain only one erf gene each, followed by chromosome  <dig>  and 1-10-17- <dig> . the highest number of erf genes was found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  with  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively. the high number of ap2/erf sequences in these two chromosomes is mainly due to the presence of a close repetition of genes belonging to the same group. on chromosome  <dig>  the erf groups ix and x accounted for 25% and 40% of the total erf genes, respectively. this feature is even more evident in chromosome  <dig>  where group ix accounted for over 90% of the total amount of ap2/erf genes. the repetition of genes in close distances seemed to be a typical feature of group ix. interestingly, the same trend was observed for the chromosomal location of group ix  in the poplar genome  <cit> . as already observed for mikc gene subfamilies  <cit> , also ap2/erf genes belonging to the same group were located in chromosomal regions, which have been suggested to represent paralogous segments resulting from ancestral polyploidization events . for instance vverf <dig>  vverf <dig>  vverf <dig>  vverf <dig>  are located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and 16; vvap2- <dig>  vvap2- <dig>  vvap2- <dig> and vvap2- <dig> are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  closely related members of the group v  are located on the chromosomes belonging to the same paralogous segment. moreover, 50% of the erf group viii is located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

expression analyses of the ap2/erf genes in aerial tissues of v. vinifera cv. corvina
grape and wine production is strongly affected by environmental cues and pathogens during the development of the plant. since ap2/erf genes have been reported to play a role in plant development and in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, they represent ideal candidates to investigate the molecular regulation of these processes. although microarray platforms exist for the grape genome, realtime-qpcr  is a very sensitive and cost-effective technique to analyze the expression of genes with rather low expression levels, such as transcription factors  <cit> . we therefore designed a qrt-pcr platform to analyze the expression of all  <dig> ap2/erf genes in the aerial vegetative and reproductive tissues of vitis vinifera cv. corvina . the expression patterns of the genes encoding for members of the erf, ap <dig> and rav families are shown in figure  <dig>  and in figure  <dig> . erf family members  were subdivided according to their respective group . only five genes  did not reach a detectable expression level in any of the tissues considered. fourteen genes  showed high expression levels in all tissues analyzed, irrespectively of the developmental stage considered.

a broad variability of expression patterns within families and groups was observed: for instance, in the erf group v, vverf <dig> and vverf <dig> were highly expressed in leaf, inflorescence and stem tissues while vverf <dig> and vverf <dig> reached high levels in the flesh of ripe berries . very few genes exhibited a specific single tissue expression: vverf <dig> mrna was barely detectable except in leaf tissues, vverf <dig> was highly expressed in flesh tissues of the berry at the veraison stage and vvap2- <dig> showed a strong induction in skin tissues during ripening .

three erf genes displayed a high expression in leaves, stems and inflorescences and low levels in the berry tissues considered: vverf <dig> , vverf <dig> and vverf <dig>  , together with a big group of ap <dig> genes  . surprisingly, none of the ap2-coding genes, which have been reported to play a role in flower development, were exclusively expressed in the inflorescence tissues .

expression pattern similarity did not mimic the sequence similarity of erf group ix. for instance, vverf <dig> and vverf <dig>  which share more than 95% similarity, exhibited different expression patterns in fruit tissues and vverf <dig> displayed stem specificity whereas its closest paralog, vverf <dig>  was poorly expressed in the same tissue.

ripening regulated ap2/erf genes in grape berry
ap <dig> and erf related transcription factors are assumed to play a role in fruit development during the ripening process in several species . to identify ap2/erf genes whose expression changes during the transition from veraison to full ripeness , we analyzed the mrna levels of  <dig> ap2/erf genes identified in skin and flesh tissues.

three genes increased their mrna levels during ripening in both skin and flesh berry tissues  and only vverf <dig> decreased its expression . the highest number of differentially expressed ap2/erf genes occurred in the skin tissues, where  <dig> genes were up-regulated at least  <dig> fold, and  <dig> genes were down regulated  . the opposite trend was observed in the flesh tissues, where  <dig> genes were induced and  <dig> repressed. in all groups of differentially expressed genes , the erf ix group was the most represented , although only among the up-regulated erf genes in the skin tissues the overrepresentation was significant . within the erf family, at least one member from almost every group sequence changed its expression from veraison to full ripeness. in arabidopsis and tomato , transcription factors belonging to the erf group ix, such as aterf <dig> and slpti <dig>  are involved in the regulation of plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses mediated by ethylene and jasmonates  <cit> . direct targets of aterf <dig> include pathogenesis related proteins, chitinases and β- <dig> -glucanases. therefore it is tempting to speculate that the erf genes belonging to group ix regulate proteins involved in stress responses in grapes.

relative mrna levels erf, ap <dig> and rav members up- or down-regulated in the skin tissues of the grapevine berry during transition from the veraison stage to full ripeness, quantified by rt-qpcr, according to the 2-ΔΔct method. the results shown are from at least three independent replicates. expression values for which a standard deviation  is not provided, correspond to samples that did not reach the selected threshold fluorescence level before the 39th cycle in one of the two ripening stages.

to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of genes encoding for β- <dig>  glucanases , class iv chitinase  and pathogenesis related proteins  using rt-qpcr. vvglucβ- <dig> and vvglucβ- <dig>  vvchit4- <dig>  vvpr <dig>  and vvpr10l-b were induced in the transition from veraison to full ripeness in the skin of the berry . the same trend was observed for several erf-ix genes including vverf <dig>  vverf <dig> and vverf <dig> . moreover, the expression profile of erf-ix vverf <dig> and vverf <dig> is highly correlated with that of genes encoding chitinases, β  <dig> -glucanases and thaumatin during different stages of berry development in the dataset published by deluc et al.  <cit>  .

only the vii group, which contains three members, was not represented in any of the deg lists . four ap <dig> genes were induced and two were repressed in the skin during the ripening phase considered, whereas in the flesh only one gene was up-regulated and two were down-regulated .

discussion
comparison of the ap2/erf superfamily across sequenced plant genomes
in this study, a comprehensive search for genes encoding for ap2/erf transcription factors encoded in the vitis vinifera genome was carried out, leading to the identification of  <dig> genes. previously,  <dig> ap2/erf genes had been annotated, as reported by zhuang et al.  <cit> . eighteen newly identified genes encoded transcription factors belonging to groups ii , iii , v , viii , ix  and x  of the erf family, to the ap <dig> family  and the rav family  . our analysis did not identify gsvivp <dig> as an erf gene due to its short sequence and the presence of two long introns. it is likely that this locus constitutes a pseudogene. this number of genes is comparable with that of arabidopsis but is only 70% of the number found in poplar and 80% of the rice ap2/erf superfamily .

the availability of the complete genome sequence of three dicot species and one monocot enabled a comparison of individual families and groups using nakano et al.'s criteria  <cit> . several erf groups  and the ap <dig> family contained more members in poplar than in grape and arabidopsis . a feature common to both woody species vitis vinifera and populus trichocarpa is the lower number of genes in group i in the erf family and the higher number in groups v and ix. in medicago truncatula, wxp <dig>  a group i erf, contributes to drought tolerance by regulating the accumulation of cuticular waxes  <cit>  while, in arabidopsis, this function is performed by the shyne clade of erf genes , all belonging to group v  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the function of group i and v overlaps and the increase in group v in woody dicot species poises the lower number of group i genes. the expression of homologs of the arabidopsis shn clade, vverf <dig> and vverf <dig>  in fruit skin tissues  is not unexpected, since waxy layers are produced to cover the grape berries  <cit> .

compared to all the species considered in this study, the grapevine genome has very small erf-group ii and vii. in arabidopsis, the erf-vii genes are highly expressed, suggesting to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. interestingly, also vverf <dig> and vverf <dig> are highly expressed in all the tissues analysed in this study.

erf-ix is the largest erf group in poplar and grape genomes, since it is almost twice as big as arabidopsis and rice . of the  <dig> erf-ix genes identified,  <dig> exhibited a high sequence similarity not limited to the coding sequence but also extended to the 5'and 3' surrounding regions . however, since the expression profiles of these genes did not overlap completely, it is likely that their expression is driven by different promoter sequences. interestingly, members of group ix displayed a particular clustered organization along chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> , similar to the one observed in the poplar genome for the same group, although in this species the tandem repetition does not exceed four genes.

the tandem repetition of almost identical coding sequences suggests that these duplication events in the grapevine genome are quite recent. moreover, it is tempting to speculate on the molecular mechanisms that led to the formation of such a long cluster of almost identical sequences, maybe involving the interaction of transposons or retroposons with the genomic sequence encoding erf-ix genes. magnani et al.  <cit>  showed that a cyanobacterium  possesses a hnh endonuclease protein with an ap <dig> dna binding domain and suggested that the ap <dig> sequence approached the plant genome as a lateral transfer from a viral or bacterial donor. gene duplication is more likely to be retained for gene families involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . nakano et al.  <cit>  suggested that an increased number of genes in groups iii and ix might improve plant fitness since these genes are involved in the regulation of environmental stress responses. however, many other erf groups, which do not have a high number of members, play a role in stress responses  <cit> . therefore, the functional role of the erf-ix group alone does not seem enough to explain the high number of genes in this family and their repetition on chromosomes. further analyses of the nucleotidic and amino acid sequences of the genes belonging to this family are likely to shed light on this topic.

genes belonging to the rav family are highly conserved among dicot species, which contain six members, and not very different in rice   <cit> .

the number of ap <dig> genes is very similar between arabidopsis  and vitis  and lower than that of poplar  . the generally higher number of ap2/erf genes in the poplar genome is likely to be a consequence of a recent whole-genome duplication in the poplar lineage  <cit> . curiously, a divergent member of the ap <dig> family, whose poplar homolog has been called soloist, is maintained in a single copy in all plant genomes analyzed so far. the conservativeness of the sequence, plus the fact that it is only weakly related to other ap2/erf genes, suggests that this gene diverged from the ap <dig> family early in the evolution of the plant species. surprisingly, it also maintained its single copy feature during the separation of the monocot and dicot and the spread of the eurosid clade  <cit> .

differential expression of ap2/erf genes in aerial tissues of vitis vinifera
the development of an rt-qpcr platform  encompassing the complete number of ap2/erf genes previously identified, together with knowledge about the molecular function of their homolog in other plant species, may help in associating a role with some of these transcription factors.

traditionally, the expression of erf genes has been associated with the molecular response to ethylene, from which their acronym derives. although ap2/erf transcription factors are regulated by a number of physical-chemical stimuli, many erf genes are indeed ethylene responsive and therefore have been suggested as being involved in the ripening process in climacteric fruits. wine grape is considered to be a non-climacteric fruit but ethylene still plays an important role during development and ripening processes such as anthocyanin accumulation  <cit>  and alcohol dehydrogenase expression  <cit> .

although many erf genes have been shown to play a role in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses, only a few genes have been described as regulators of organ development. two homologues of the development-related erfs atlep and atbol, vverf <dig> and vverf <dig>  are constantly expressed in the berry skin tissues, whereas a vitis homolog of the cytokinin responsive factors exhibits leaf-specific expression.

many members of the groups ii, iii and ix  were highly expressed in all the tissues examined . in arabidopsis, tobacco  and tomato , erfs belonging to groups ii and iii play a role in response to abiotic stress  whereas group ix includes genes involved in the response to pathogens . the relatively high expression of members of these groups in grapevine tissues, under non stress conditions, may represent a default defence system, which was already present before the pathogen attack or the environmental stress took place, activated only when a trigger signal is perceived.

ap <dig> and rav genes are the main actors in the determination of cell fate and development from meristems to fully developed organs. however, with the exception of vvap2- <dig>  the expression of ap <dig> and rav genes in the tissues considered was not restricted to a single organ. on the other hand, vvap2- <dig> is mainly expressed in the inflorescence tissues .

contrary to what was expected, the expression homolog of the ap <dig> gene, vvap2- <dig>  vvap2- <dig> and vvap2- <dig>  was not restricted to floral organs but extended to vegetative and fruit tissues . vvap2- <dig>  vvap2- <dig>  vvap2- <dig> and vvap2- <dig>  which are homologs of the arabidopsis ail- <dig>  ap <dig>  toe <dig> and ant genes respectively, had a similar expression pattern, with the highest expression in the leaf, inflorescence and stem, but not in the fruit tissues . no member of the ap <dig> or rav family showed a fruit-specific expression pattern.

several erf-ix members  reached high mrna levels in the skin tissues of the berry, but not in the flesh tissues . this differential expression between skin and flesh among members of group ix may reflect the need for a constantly activated defence in the skin of the berry, which is continuously exposed to pathogens attack. this was not the case however in the flesh tissues, where bacteria and fungi can only be present once the physical barrier of the skin has been penetrated.

expression changes of grapevine ap2/erf genes in the veraison to full ripeness transition
skin and flesh tissues from grape berries differ greatly during the transition from veraison to full ripeness with respect to erf-gene expression. in the skin,  <dig> genes were up-regulated at least four-fold and  <dig> were down-regulated. in the flesh tissues, only  <dig> ap2/erf genes were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated .

group ix contained most of the genes induced or repressed by ripening in both skin and flesh tissues of the grapevine berry . members of the same group are up-regulated in apple and plum fruit during ripening  <cit> . deluc et al.  <cit>  identified a small number of erf ix as being differentially regulated throughout the development of the grape berry. this was either due to the sensitivity limitation of the microarray technique or because the transcriptome of skin and flesh tissues was not analyzed separately. the ripening-related induction of many members of group ix suggests that the skin cells need to be prepared against pathogen attack in a phase during which the berry is enriched with sugars and therefore represents the ideal substrate for pathogen growth. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that vvglucβ- <dig>  vvglucβ- <dig>  vvchit4- <dig>  vvpr <dig>  and vvpr10l-b were up-regulated during ripening, preferentially in the skin tissues, together with erfs belonging to group ix . in addition, in a more extensive series of developmental stages in whole berries , the expression of stress-related genes correlated with that of erf-ix members . moreover, increased levels of pr proteins and chitinases during the transition from veraison to ripening have been reported for grape barbera cultivar  <cit> . in wine, pr proteins represent one of the most abundant classes of proteins  <cit> . since they can negatively affect wine clarity and stability, their regulation may represent an important trait for improving wine quality.

the erf-v vverf <dig> and vverf <dig>  homologs of the arabidopsis shn <dig> gene, were induced in both skin and flesh tissues, while vverf <dig> was repressed. an up-regulation of group v members during berry development was also reported by deluc et al.  <cit> . in arabidopsis, shn <dig> regulates lipid biosynthetic pathways towards cutin synthesis  <cit> , while a barley shn1-homolog regulates lipid anabolism to generate organ adhesion  <cit> . of the direct targets of shn <dig>  kannangara et al.  <cit>  identified the long acyl-coa synthetase  <dig> , which is required for cutin biosynthesis in wild-type plants. interestingly, in vitis vinifera cv. cabernet, vvlacs <dig>  a homolog of the arabidopsis lacs <dig>  was reported to be up-regulated during ripening  <cit>  and its expression highly correlates with vverf <dig> in the same subset . an equal number of erf-iii genes was induced and repressed in the skin, whereas only two were up-regulated in the flesh tissues . group iii encodes transcription factors involved in the crosstalk between biotic and abiotic stress  <cit>  and therefore may play a similar role as group ix during the last phases of ripening in the berry. members of group iv, which were also involved in stress response regulation, were induced in the skin but not in the flesh . the ripening related induction of group viii-erf has already been reported in plums . also in the grape berry, three members were up-regulated in the skin tissues .

previous studies on ripening regulated transcripts identified members of the group vii as being associated with ripening . however, in our transcriptional analysis, none of the three erf-vii genes showed a differential expression in the berry skin or flesh in the transition from veraison to full ripeness . it is possible that the ripening-related induction of these genes occurs at earlier stages of the ripening process.

two ap <dig> genes, vvap2- <dig> and vvap2- <dig>  homologs to the arabidopsis ptl <dig>  and ptl <dig> , respectively were strongly up-regulated in skin tissues during ripening, whereas an ail- <dig> homolog, vvap2- <dig>  was repressed. in arabidopsis, the ptl proteins act in a dose-dependent way to regulate stem cell maintenance and meristem boundaries in arabidopsis, probably by pin-dependent auxin distribution . their function in fruit development has not yet been studied; however they represent interesting candidates as regulators of the transition from different ripening stages. the rav gene vvrav <dig> was up-regulated in the skin tissues . its closest arabidopsis homolog, rav <dig>  has been proposed to act as repressor, through the rlfgv motif located at the c-terminus  <cit> . since vvrav <dig> maintained the presence of this motif, it is possible to hypothesize a similar molecular activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this study we identified  <dig> ap2/erf genes in the grape genome and characterized their expression patterns in aerial vegetative, inflorescence and berry skin and flesh at two different ripening stages, veraison and full ripening. a comparison of homologs from other species, whose genome has been sequenced, together with their expression profiles, may help in an understanding of the role of these transcription factors in perennial plants. vitis vinifera represent the only woody plant whose genome is fully sequenced and whose commercial value is due to fruit production. unveiling the role of ap2/erf transcription factors in the developmental and ripening processes in this species, may help molecular breeders in improving fruit quality.
