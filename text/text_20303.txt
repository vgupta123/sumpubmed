BACKGROUND
the protozoan parasite trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of chagas' disease, which chronically affects more than  <dig> million individuals in the americas, with an annual death toll of approximately  <dig>  people  <cit> . in spite of the significant reduction in transmission over the past twenty years in countries such as argentina, brazil, chile and uruguay, chagas' disease is still a major health problem for many latin american countries. a recent epidemiological study in dogs also revealed a dangerously widespread epidemic in the state of texas  <cit> .

the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy with nifurtimox or benznidazole is low and varies greatly according to the infection status of the patients  and the parasite strains. although new drugs could potentially solve the problem, chagas' disease is one of the most neglected diseases in terms of drug development with a single new compound being tested in phase 1/ <dig> trials . based on these poor short term prospects, studies aimed at understanding the requirements for parasite invasion and multiplication of t. cruzi are still relevant.

invasion and multiplication within a variety of host cells are critical features for the survival of t. cruzi. the invasion process of mammalian non-phagocytic cells has attracted a great deal of interest in the past  <dig> years and notable advances have been obtained. different routes of invasion described by researchers have been mediated by distinct cell surface receptors, secondary messengers and transcription factors . in one of the mechanisms described, the infective forms of t. cruzi  take advantage of a host cell mechanism for puncture repair and exocytosis of lysosomes to recruit these organelles to the parasite-cell junction. after a ca2+ dependent fusion with the cell membrane, lysosomes become part of the intracellular parasitophorous vacuole. alternatively, parasites can use a lysosome-independent pathway. in this case, the host cell plasma membrane accounts for the parasitophorus vacuole. ultimately, these organelles fuse with lysosomes, a step that recently has been shown to be critical for parasite retention and productive infection  <cit> . among the parasite surface molecules that might be relevant for the attachment, signaling and penetration are members of a family of mucin-like glycoproteins, members of a trans-sialidases family, and proteases .

once inside the host cells, t. cruzi manages to disrupt the parasitophorus vacuole, an event that could be mediated by lytic proteins and the enzyme trans-sialidase  <cit> . during the escape, trypomastigotes transform into amastigotes and express on its surface some stage-specific molecules  <cit> . in the host cell cytoplasm, gpi-deficient amastigotes arrest replication and subsequently failed to differentiate into trypomastigotes  <cit> . the molecular events required for amastigote transformation into trypomastigotes and their release from the infected cells are completely unknown.

the accessibility of the new reverse genetic tools such as rnai have allowed investigators to search for host molecules that might be important for the t. cruzi invasion as well as intracellular parasite survival and multiplication. villalta's group demonstrated that the silencing of laminin-γ <dig> expression, a protein belonging to the extracellular matrix and regulated by the parasite, by cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells rendered them significantly more resistant to the binding and penetration of parasites . this observation supports the hypothesis that the binding to laminin is an important step for the early process of t. cruzi infection. also, it suggests that laminin-binding proteins expressed on the surface of t. cruzi are important virulence factors during the infection of human smooth muscle cells  <cit> . utilizing a similar approach, the same group demonstrated that stable interference of thrombospondin- <dig> expression, also a protein belonging to the extracellular matrix, in cultured hela cells in vitro caused an increase in the cell resistance to t. cruzi invasion  <cit> . these studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the rnai strategy when studying the host cell factors critical for parasite survival and eventually identifying potential targets for new therapies.

one of the laminin-binding proteins, a member of the family of the trans-sialidases of t. cruzi , was shown to bind to host cytokeratin  <dig> . the ck <dig> is an intermediate filament protein of the acid cytokeratin family belonging to type i, expressed in the internal epithelia cell cytoplasm. this protein together with ck <dig> exhibit resistance features in response to other forms of stress and to apoptosis  <cit> . this interaction through a c-terminal peptide ligand denominated fly domain  was shown to be relevant for parasite invasion as anti-cytokeratin antibodies inhibited the infection of epithelial cells by t. cruzi. the fly motif is not only present in proteins expressed on the surface of trypomastigotes but also on a protein that is abundant on the surface of amastigotes denominated amastigote surface protein- <dig> . based on this observation, it was our intention to further investigate whether the host cell ck <dig> expression was indeed critical for t. cruzi invasion and/or subsequent parasite growth in vitro. for this purpose we used hela cells in which we transiently down-regulated the host ck <dig> using the rnai strategy. upon infection, we evaluated parasite attachment, penetration, lysosome recruitment, phagolysosomal escape and cytoplasm replication in cultured hela cells. rnai-mediated knock-down of ck <dig> did not interfere with trypomastigotes mediated events. once amastigotes from two distinct strains of t. cruzi were in the cytoplasm of ck <dig> rnai-treated cells, their development was severely inhibited.

RESULTS
rnai knockdown of endogenous ck <dig> in cultured hela cells
earlier studies have suggested that ck <dig> plays a role during the interaction between trypomastigotes of t. cruzi and non-phagocytic mammalian cells  <cit> . to further evaluate whether ck <dig> expression was indeed critical for the host parasite interaction, we established an in vitro transient transfection system to knock down the expression of endogenous ck <dig>  following the transfection of cultured hela cells with ck <dig> rnai, we evaluated the levels of ck 18-specific transcripts with the aid of quantitative real-time pcr. as shown in fig. 1a,  <dig> h following transfection, the amount of ck <dig> transcripts were reduced by more than  <dig> fold in hela cells treated with ck <dig> rnai when compared to control cells untreated or treated with a control rnai. the treatment did not modify the expression of the control housekeeping gene rlp <dig> used to normalize the level transcript on each sample. we then studied whether the reduction of ck <dig> transcripts by rnai were reflected at the protein level by quantitative immunoblotting analysis . as estimated by densitometry, the inhibition of ck <dig> expression was ~70%, without significant inhibition on the synthesis of β-actin . finally, we performed an immunofluorescence based assay to confirm that ck <dig> expression was inhibited in most cells. as shown in fig. 1d, hela cells transiently transfected with ck <dig> rnai and subsequently infected with trypomastigotes of t. cruzi, had no detectable fluorescence . significant inhibition of ck <dig> expression in cultured hela cells was maintained for at least  <dig> h following transfection .

because ck <dig> is part of intermediate cell filaments which also contains large amounts of ck <dig>  we tested whether ck <dig> rnai-treated hela cells would also reduce the expression of stable ck <dig>  indeed, ck <dig> rnai-treatment reduced the immunofluorescence of hela cell stained with specific anti-ck <dig> antibodies . similar experiments were performed with anti-ck <dig>  in this case we could not detect ck <dig> in untreated or ck <dig> rnai-treated hela cells .

also, it was possible that the reduction of the levels of this protein could interfere with cell survival. to evaluate this possibility, hela cells, transfected or not, were kept in culture for  <dig> h before cell viability was estimated by staining with annexin-v-fitc and pi. as shown in fig.  <dig>  we did not observe an increase in the frequency of annexin-positive cells when we compared ck <dig> rnai-treated or untreated cells. to confirm annexin assay results, we measured the mitochondrial activity by mtt assay, a method for assessing cell viability by quantifying the conversion of the tetrazolium salt to its formazan product. we observed that there was no difference between the ck <dig> rnai- treated or control cells . this demonstrates that rnai-mediated ck <dig> knockdown did not promote apoptosis.

rnai-mediated ck <dig> knockdown impairs amastigote replication in the cytoplasm of hela cells
ck <dig> rnai-treated hela cells were initially infected with tissue culture trypomastigotes of the y strain of t. cruzi. after  <dig> h, cells were washed and fixed. the number of trypomastigotes attached, the frequencies of infected cells, as well as the number of trypomastigotes inside  <dig> cells were estimated. we found that all of them were similar in ck <dig> rnai-treated or untreated cells . we therefore concluded that the reduction of the ck <dig> expression did not change the ability of trypomastigotes to attach and invade these cells. during the invasion process, the parasites recruit lysosomes, which fuse with the parasitophorous vacuoles containing trypomastigotes. approximately  <dig> h after infection, more than 90% of the parasites can be co-stained with antibodies specific for the phagolysosomal marker lamp- <dig> . after that period, trypomastigotes differentiate and escape the parasitophorous vacuoles/phagolysosomes. we estimated whether both processes also occur in ck <dig> rnai-treated cells. at different times post-infection, the frequency of parasites co-stained with the phagolysosomal marker lamp- <dig> was similar among infected hela cells, regardless of whether they were transfected with ck <dig> rnai .

twenty-four hours after infection, no parasites could be co-stained with anti-lamp- <dig> whether they were in the cytoplasm of ck <dig> rnai-treated or non-treated cells. we then concluded that the reduction of the ck <dig> expression did not influence the ability of parasites to recruit the host cell lysosomes, transform into amastigotes and exit the parasitophorous vacuoles.

after  <dig> h, amastigotes were in the host cell cytoplasm where they began multiplying. when we estimated the frequency of infected cells  <dig> h after infection, we found that both ck <dig> rnai-treated cells and non-treated hela cells had similar percentages of infected cells . nevertheless, the number of intracellular amastigotes per  <dig> hela cells treated with ck <dig> rnai was 79% lower. considering that the frequencies of infected cells are lower, we estimated an inhibition of 85% on the amastigote growth during the  <dig> h period . the impact of ck <dig> rnai treatment on parasite growth can be further highlighted by our estimates on the frequency of infected cells containing  <dig> to  <dig> or more than  <dig> parasites. in the case of ck <dig> rnai-treated hela cells, less than 10% of the infected cells had more than  <dig> parasites. in contrast, more than 75% of the infected control cells were infected with more than  <dig> amastigotes per cell . also, we tested the effect of ck <dig> rnai treatment on parasite growth in llc-mk <dig> cells, after infection with trypomastigotes of y strain. as observed in hela cells, the amastigotes growth during the  <dig> h period  was dramatically reduced in the llc-mk <dig> cells. while 70% of the ck <dig> rnai-treated llc-mk <dig> cells displayed with  <dig> to  <dig> parasites, 80% of control rnai-treated infected cells had >  <dig> amastigotes per cell . this suggests that the ck <dig> rnai treatment can also impair the amastigotes growth in llc-mk <dig> cells.

we then evaluated whether ck <dig> expression in hela cells was in fact important for the multiplication of amastigotes of different t. cruzi strains. to answer this question, ck <dig> rnai-treated hela cells were infected with trypomastigotes of y or cl-brener strains. after  <dig> h, the frequency of infected cells and the number of amastigotes per  <dig> cells were estimated. as exemplified in fig.  <dig>  ck <dig> rnai-treated hela cells had lower numbers of amastigotes of y or cl-brener strains .

a hela cells were transiently transfected with ck <dig> or control rnai  <dig> h earlier as described in methods section. these cells were infected with culture trypomastigotes of y or cl-brener strain using the parasite per cell ratio of 10: <dig> or 5: <dig> respectively. the number of intracellular amastigotes was estimated  <dig> h post-infection and the results are expressed as average of triplicates ± sd. this experiment was performed  <dig> times with similar results.

b the number of amastigotes in cultures containing medium or rnai control are lower than the number of amastigotes in cultures containing medium with control rnai .

because reduced levels of ck <dig> expression are, in some way, interfering in the intracellular amastigotes growth, we decide to evaluate whether there was a correlation between the cellular localization of ck <dig> and the parasite after infection. co-localization experiments are depicted in fig.  <dig>  in hela cells infected with amatigotes of y strain, we observed yellow staining denoting a merge between the green  and red  fluorescences . treatment with ck <dig> rnai strongly inhibited ck <dig> expression and reduced growth of amastigotes of the y strain .

the experiment of co-localization described above suggested a physical interaction between amastigotes and hela cell's ck <dig>  a putative parasite ligand for ck <dig> was described as the highly conserved fly domain . asp- <dig> expressed by amastigotes of the y strain contains the fly domain and could be the ligand to the host cytoplasmatic ck <dig>  <cit> . we performed a direct binding assay of the asp- <dig> recombinant protein of y strain  to fixed, permeabilized or not, hela cells in vitro. although mab to ck- <dig> strongly stained permeabilized hela cells , the recombinant protein his- <dig> kda only binds to hela cells fixed but not permeabilized, suggesting a binding to the surface membrane . in any case, we considered this binding irrelevant to our purposes because it was not inhibited by ck- <dig> rnai treatment of hela cells .

discussion
the present study was designed to evaluate the possible role of ck <dig> in the interaction between t. cruzi and non-phagocytic cells in vitro. the success of the transient knockdown of ck <dig> in cultured hela cells allowed us to further investigate for this topic. unexpectedly, in the presence of limited amounts of ck <dig>  trypomastigotes invaded hela cells efficiently. in addition, the recruitment of lysosomes to the parasitophorous vacuole and the subsequent escape from the parasitophorous vacuole/phagolysosomes were not impaired in ck <dig> rnai-treated cells.

once the amastigotes were in the cytoplasm of hela cells treated with ck <dig> rnai, the growth of parasites of two different strains  was severely arrested. co-localization studies support the hypothesis of close contact between amastigotes of the y strain and ck <dig> in the hela cell cytoplasm. because hela cells have ck <dig>  it would be possible that it replace ck <dig>  however, we observed that the level of expression of ck <dig> was also reduced following ck <dig> rnai treatment of hela cells .

it would be possible that rnai to ck- <dig> inhibited the expression of parasites ck. however, gene silencing with rnai in t. cruzi can not be performed due to the fact that this system is not present in these cells. two main points have been discussed to explain this absence:  the ago <dig> homologue  or any other gene involved in rnai pathway are absent;  at some point during the evolution, the parasite acquired an rnai repressor as a reflection of a successful viral attack .

cytokeratins are the most abundant structural proteins of epithelial cells, organized as heterodimers and forming a network of 10– <dig> nm wide intermediate filaments . hela cells express ck <dig> and ck <dig>  the if maintains cell integrity, protects from environmental stress and regulates cytoplasmic protein availability, leading to the regulation of cell signaling. indeed, ck <dig> alterations may be one of several anti-apoptotic events  <cit> . however, in our experiment, we observed no significant induction of apoptosis in hela cells in the absence of ck <dig>  it has been shown that ck <dig> but not ck <dig> is a substrate for caspase digestion during the course of epithelial cell apoptosis, and the activation of caspase  <dig> is strictly dependent on the presence of ck <dig>  <cit> . based on that, we can speculate that the reduced levels of ck <dig> caused by ck <dig> rnai, could affect the caspase  <dig> activation, that in the absence of its substrate would be in the inactive form and consequently the cell would not enter in the apoptosis process.

another interesting question is how the interaction with ck <dig> or ck <dig> facilitates the multiplication of amastigotes. because very little is known about the parasite requirements for amastigote proliferation in the host cell cytoplasm, this question has no simple answer. because amastigotes are intracellular forms and need to proliferate, it is possible that they bind to ck <dig>  the binding to ck <dig> would initiate a signaling cascade within the parasite, recruiting the signaling proteins required for its multiplication. our hypothesis is based on previous observations. goto et al.  <cit>  described the induction of growth of leishmania  mexicana amastigotes and promastigotes by insulin-like growth factor i . igf-i from the host binds to a single-site receptor on both promastigote and amastigote forms of leishmania, initiating a signaling cascade  <cit> . igf-i induced tyrosine phosphorylation of parasite proteins with different molecular weights in both forms of the parasite; it increased the dna synthesis rate and consequently, the number of parasites inside the host cells rose  <cit> . the putative signaling pathway originated from the interaction between ck <dig> from the host cell and a putative parasite receptor is currently under investigation.

our work is the third example of the use of rnai technology to characterize proteins that might be involved in t. cruzi interaction with host cells. this approach proved to be feasible in small target projects and it has been used in pilot studies to conduct a genome-wide rnai screen. we have already initiated this type of study in partnership with a private research institute. in the case of other non-neglected pathogens such as mycobacteria and hiv, this approach is already in use  <cit> .

although the rnai knockdown of host cells is being performed only to a limited extent and in vitro, it may be feasible to use rnai technology to inhibit pathogen multiplication in localized areas of a patient's body. in the case of t. cruzi, this strategy might be useful, along with other forms of local treatment such as the recently developed cell therapy  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here demonstrate that ck18-rnai treatment of hela cells does not affect t. cruzi trypomastigotes invasion, the recruitment of lysosomes to the parasitophorus vacuole and the subsequent escape to the cell cytoplasm. on the other hand, ck <dig> expression in hela cells is important for the intracellular amastigotes multiplication of y and cl-brener strains. the elucidation of mechanisms used by the parasites for its replication inside the cell cytoplasm may lead to new paths for drug intervention.
