BACKGROUND
high-throughput cell imaging assays allow broad and quantitative measurement of the response of cell populations to perturbations including drugs  <cit> , small molecules  <cit>  and small interfering rna   <cit> . screens have revealed genes whose depletion affects cell cycle progression  <cit> , measured the effects of drugs on the morphology of hela cells  <cit>  and identified novel dna damage factors by grouping genes by phenotypic similarity  <cit> . most screening experiments are performed as endpoint assays and provide observations that in many cases are consequences of unseen intermediate events. thus, functional interpretation of results from endpoint analysis can be obscured by indirect effects. high-throughput time-lapse imaging is a technique  <cit>  that overcomes this limitation and considerably extends the potential of biological discovery by capturing the dynamic aspects of the observed phenotypes. a typical feature of large-scale assays is that the range of observed phenotypes has multiple dimensions, reflecting for example the different effects of perturbations on cell growth, cytoskeleton structure, cell division or motility. a goal of the data analysis is the extraction of multivariate, but relatively low-dimensional phenotypic descriptors that are biologically meaningful, interpretable and robust to experimental noise. in the case of time-resolved data, the time-dependence of the observations needs to be appropriately described and summarised.

the mitocheck project performed a time-lapse imaging assay that employed sirnas to test the implication of human genes in transient biological processes such as cell division or migration genome-wide  <cit> . in this experiment, hela cells stably expressing core histone 2b tagged with green fluorescent protein  were seeded on sirna-spotted slides, incubated for  <dig> h and imaged with automated fluorescence microscopy for  <dig> h. video sequences of cell populations on each sirna-spot were analysed by image segmentation, and at each frame, each individual cell was categorised into one of  <dig> morphological classes mostly related to cell division . by comparing the abundances of the different morphological classes to negative control experiments,  <dig> genes were identified as potential mitotic hits . subsequently, further validation experiments were done using independent sirnas  and rescue of  <dig> gene products using orthologous mouse genes.

the table shows the counts of the  <dig> nuclear morphologies  defined in the mitocheck assay and the grouping into  <dig> cellular states described in our manuscript.

this analysis of the mitocheck data generated an enormous wealth of results about the implication of human genes in cell division, but did not fully exhaust the information contained in the data. several temporal features including the time of mitotic arrest, cell death or cell cycle arrest, or the duration of mitosis were not quantified. in principle, the nature of the data –time-lapse movies of dividing cells– asks for analysis of the single-cell tracking graphs  <cit> . however, reliable tracking of the cells used in this experiment requires a time resolution between image frames lower than  <dig> min. for the main mitocheck data set, the decision had been made to use a lower temporal sampling frequency -1) in order to allow for a larger volumes in other dimensions of the experimental design, in particular, number of sirnas tested and number of cells per sirna. in other experiments, there may be analogous considerations that hinder tracking at the single-cell level, while still providing population-level time-course data.

in this study, we used a cell population-level dynamic model to represent the temporal evolution of dividing cells. by fitting cell counts in four transient cellular states, our model yielded parameters that quantify the dynamic effects of sirna treatments on cell population levels. model parameters allowed reliable estimation of the penetrance and time of four disruption events of the cell cycle: quiescence, mitosis arrest, polynucleation and cell death. we also derived the interphase and mitosis durations from penetrance parameters. we found  <dig> sirnas that resulted in quiescence, mitosis arrest, polynucleation or cell death at specific times, or increased interphase or mitosis duration. comparison of the results with known cell-cycle and cell death regulators and systematic gene enrichment analysis indicate high sensitivity and accuracy of the method. the reported list is a useful resource, containing testable hypotheses about causal roles of genes in cell cycle regulation and cell death.

RESULTS
modelling cell population dynamics
we considered the cell count data from the mitocheck primary screen, consisting of  <dig>  movies of sirna spot experiments targeting  <dig>  genes . most of the genes  were targeted by at least two independent sirna sequences, each done in at least three spots. four controls were repeatedly used on each slide: siscrambled, a non-targeting negative control; sikif <dig>  targeting the gene kif <dig>  which encodes a kinesin needed for centrosome segregation; sicopb <dig>  targeting an essential protein binding to the golgi vesicle and siincenp, targeting a centromere-associated protein coding gene required for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. each spot experiment yielded time courses of cell counts of  <dig> morphologically distinct transient nuclear morphologies, first acquired  <dig> h after cell seeding, and then measured every  <dig> min for  <dig> h. in total, more than  <dig> billion nuclear morphologies were measured and classified .

in order to quantify the phenotypic effect induced by sirna treatments, we grouped the  <dig> nuclear morphologies into four cellular states recapitulating the cell cycle: interphase, mitotic, polynucleated and dead. we used an ordinary differential equation  model to characterise the dynamic transitions between the four populations . we assumed that cells could enter and leave states with different, experiment-dependent transition rates. among the twelve theoretically possible transitions between different states, we considered the six following ones: interphase cells may enter mitosis or die, mitotic cells may divide into twice as many interphase cells, become polynucleated or die, and polynucleated cells may die. we first considered a model with constant rates; however, we found that the data from many of the movies could not be fit satisfactorily. therefore, we extended the model by allowing a simple time-dependence of the transition rates, motivated by the notion that the effect of an sirna on a cell population occurs with a time delay after the transfection, reflecting differences in rnai efficiency and protein life-time. hence, to account both for experiment-dependent penetrance and delay of phenotypic effects, the transition rates were modelled with four parametric sigmoid functions , each dependent on two parameters: a transition penetrance αx and an inflection time point τx. the same transition rate function kd was used for all three transitions into cell death. the interphase-to-mitosis kim and mitosis-to-interphase kmi transition rates were modelled with non-zero fixed intercepts, representing the basal rates in the untreated, proliferating populations. the model represents the temporal evolution of the four cell populations starting at cell seeding time, with an unknown initial number of cells n <dig>  to account for normal cell contamination, resulting from untransfected cells moving into the spot region, we introduced an additional contamination parameter μ to represent the fraction of the cell subpopulation that follows a basal cell growth. under this model, each spot experiment was described by  <dig> parameters: the initial number of cells n <dig> at seeding time, the contamination parameter μ and  <dig> transition parameters: penetrance αx and inflection time τx each for kd,kim,kmi and kmp.

for each spot experiment, parameters were robustly estimated by fitting the cell count time course to the model by penalised least squares . the mean relative error , i. e., the average of absolute differences between the fitted and the measured cell counts relative to the maximum number of cells, measured the accuracy of the fit in one spot. 95% of the spot experiments had an mre lower than  <dig> %, demonstrating the overall high goodness of fit of the model. spot experiments with high mre, indicative of lack of model fit, were discarded from the analysis. we visually inspected a random selection of about  <dig> of these movies and associated time courses, and in all cases, technical artefacts such as loss-of-focus, spotting issues or well contamination were identified as source of the misfit.

analysis of sirnas disrupting the cell cycle
in normal exponential growth, cells are transitioning from interphase to mitosis and back to interphase at constant rates. we focused on four types of disruptions of the basal cell cycle shown in figure 2: quiescence, when cells stop dividing, mitotic arrest, when cells stop going back in interphase, polynucleation, when cells start becoming polynucleated and cell death, when cells start to die. each of these events was associated with a corresponding transition penetrance and inflection time.

transition penetrances proved to be reliable indicators of disruptions of the cell cycle. as an example, in cell death, cells growing in the control spots sicopb <dig> had a significantly higher mean cell death penetrance  than cells seeded in the negative control spots  . this is in agreement with the essential role of copb <dig> in binding golgi vesicles. similarly, cells subject to sikif <dig> had a significant higher mean mitotic arrest penetrance than negative control spots  and a high mean cell death penetrance , consistent with cell death that follows prometaphase arrest induced by the treatment. based on these observations, we defined thresholds on each of the four transition penetrances to detect the sirnas that disrupt the cell cycle .

transition inflection points quantified the times of disruption of the cell cycle. for each sirna, we summarised the four times obtained from the replicate spots by average and standard deviation. we identified genes with reproducible cell cycle disruption times by requiring standard deviation of less than  <dig> h and average of less than  <dig> h after seeding time; the latter criterion was motivated by the generally lower confidence of the inflection time estimates at later times. using these criteria, we found  <dig> sirnas leading to quiescence at reproducible times,  <dig> inducing mitotic arrest,  <dig> leading to polynucleation and  <dig> causing cell death additional file 1: table s1).

the targets of the sirnas inducing cell death included the protein units of the golgi vesicular coat copa and copb <dig>  several known apoptosis regulators such as tp53aip <dig> and the ras family members rab <dig> and ran. interestingly, three sirnas targeting copa and copb <dig> induced cell death at similar time points , together with sicopb <dig> . the similarity of these timings is consistent with the fact that the proteins are part of the same protein complex. on the contrary, sirnas directed at the rna helicase ddx39a induced an early cell death at  <dig>  h, which could reflect a different cell death mechanism from the one caused by copa and copb <dig> inhibition. we also identified several sirnas inducing cell death and targeting uncharacterised genes such as c3orf <dig> , c3orf <dig> or c16orf <dig>  however, due to the existence of off-target effects in rna interference, functional rescue of the phenotypes and secondary functional assays would be needed to confirm the essential role of these genes.

we found  <dig> sirnas inducing mitotic arrest at reproducible times, including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor cdkn2a at  <dig>  h, the cell cycle progression control protein cdc <dig> at  <dig>  h or nek <dig>  a kinase involved in the control of centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation, at  <dig>  h. due to the coupled nature of mitotic arrest and cell death that may follow, we analysed the  <dig> sirnas that induced these two phenotypes at reproducible times in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  as expected, pearson correlation between time of mitotic arrest and time of cell death was  <dig> , confirming the relationship between the phenotypes.

analysis of sirnas increasing mitosis and interphase duration
average residence time in a cellular state can be derived from transition penetrances using dimensional arguments, as described in the methods section. in particular, we were able to estimate mitosis duration  and interphase duration from the model parameters. cells growing in negative control spots had a median mitosis duration parameter of  <dig> min, in agreement with live imaging studies in hela cells  <cit> . in contrast, for cells treated with sikif <dig> the value for this parameter was strongly elevated to  <dig>  h , consistent with the essential role of kif <dig> in progression to metaphase. similarly, for cells treated with siincenp the mitosis duration parameter was  <dig>  h , reflecting the need of incenp for proper chromosome segregation.

we summarised the mitosis duration parameter for each sirna by computing the geometric mean of the values from the replicate spots. the geometric mean was chosen over the arithmetic mean to reduce the influence of outliers from highly variable large mitosis duration estimates. we ruled that sirna mitosis duration could not be reliably estimated when the geometric standard deviation, i. e. the exponentiated value of the standard deviation of the log transformed values, of the replicate spots was higher than  <dig> h. we found  <dig> sirnas, targeting  <dig> unique genes, that increased mitosis duration to more than  <dig> h, two times the basal mitosis duration . gene ontology  enrichment analysis of the target genes showed significant enrichment of mitotic cell cycle regulation processes . many known genes involved in mitosis progression were found, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases map2k <dig> and map3k <dig>  two subunits of the anaphase promoting complex anapc <dig> and anapc <dig>  the m-phase phosphoprotein mphosph <dig> and the cell cycle regulating kinases nek <dig>  nek <dig> and nek <dig>  <cit> . many sirnas targeting protein-coding genes with unknown functions were found, including c12orf <dig>  c3orf <dig> and ccdc <dig> . as an example, targeting the coiled-coil domain containing gene ccdc <dig> caused cells to undergo mitosis in about  <dig>  h. this result suggests that ccdc <dig> may be required for mitotic progression, and it will be interesting to further investigate such candidates in validation experiments.

shown is a selection of go terms that were significantly over-represented  with a p-value lower than 10- <dig>  most of the terms are related to mitosis and cell cycle regulation.

similar to mitosis duration, we found  <dig> sirnas that increased interphase duration to more than  <dig> h, with a geometric standard deviation lower than  <dig> h . go enrichment analysis of the  <dig> unique targets revealed a significant enrichment of genes coding for proteins involved in metabolic processes of amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols . perturbations of the metabolism of fast-growing cells are a plausible reason for decelerated cell growth and hence for an increase of interphase duration.

clustering phenotypes
the fitted transition parameters quantified the phenotypic effect of a treatment on a cell population in a multivariate manner. the parameters were designed to not depend on the initial number of cells at seeding time or on contamination by untransfected cells moving into the spot region. moreover, the penetrance parameters were time independent and unaffected by possible delays that could have occurred during slide preparation. as a result, most of the variability due to cell seeding, sirna spotting or delays in plating should have small influence on the parameter estimates. therefore, our model can be seen as a efficient method to estimate the phenotypic effect of a treatment on a cell population, separating the biological signal from the technical variability coming from the assay.

to generate a phenotypic profile for each sirna, we used the inflection time parameters and the logarithm-transformed penetrance parameters and summarized measurements from multiple spots per sirna by the median. phenotypic profiles were projected in two dimensions using linear discriminant analysis between the siscrambled, sicopb <dig> and sikif <dig> control spots . the projection recapitulated many of the previous findings: the vesicular coat protein-coding genes copa, copb <dig> and copb <dig> clustered in the same region, characterised by cell death. the kinase genes nek <dig> and nek <dig> also clustered together, characterised by a complex phenotype dominated by mitosis defect, polynucleation and cell death. c3orf <dig> fell into a phenotypic region dominated by cell death, while ccdc <dig> was located between sicopb <dig> and sikif <dig>  consistent with their phenotypes observed in figure  <dig>  similar to the approach used in  <cit> , genes with similar phenotypic profiles are frequently functionally related, and further studies can be performed to annotate the function of uncharacterised genes.

CONCLUSIONS
time-lapse data can provide more information than endpoint assays. for instance, the endpoint cell death can be reached by different avenues, and intermediate phenotypes, such as mitotic arrest, that precede the eventual outcome provide important information on mechanistic or causal specifics of the final outcome. we have presented a population-based modelling approach to quantify dynamic phenotypes from time-lapse cell imaging assays. the temporal information helps to localise the timing of events such as cell death, mitotic arrest or quiescence, and to estimate the duration of processes such as mitosis.

our approach models the temporal evolution of the population size of cellular states by a system of odes. this choice was motivated by the fact that sufficiently accurate tracking information on individual cells was not available for these data. it is possible to interpret the ode model as an approximation of the time evolution of the mean cell numbers  of an underlying stochastic markov process in the discrete space of cell state frequencies, from which it emerges by Ω-expansion of the master equation  <cit> . for the population sizes and transition types and rates of interest here, the approximation holds well, and effects of the discrete or stochastic nature of such a process on the evolution of the means  <cit>  is expected to be negligible compared to the experimental variability of the data. however, if tracking information had been available, then using it might have given more direct results, e. g., on residence time distributions of the cells in the different states. due to the presence of cell death and cell division, tracking needs to be integrated with the model fitting of a suitably defined stochastic process. an example of such an approach was presented in the cellcognition methodology  <cit> .

we used a 10-parameter ode model with  <dig> cellular states and  <dig> independent transition rates. we selected this model based on the following criteria: complexity of the model, goodness-of-fit, parameter identifiability and biological significance of the parameters. we were able to fit our model on the vast majority of spot experiments, demonstrating its overall high goodness-of-fit, despite the broad variety of dynamic phenotypes of the mitocheck assay, the overall low cell counts, the cell misclassification noise and the presence of untransfected cells. at the same time, we were able to reliably estimate the  <dig> model parameters with satisfactory precision, as is indicated by the reproducibility between the control spots, shown in the clear separation of control phenotypes in figure  <dig>  as part of the model development, we tested simpler and more complex models. the models with fewer parameters, however, failed to model the complex phenotypes of some of our positive controls, such as sikif <dig> . parameter identifiability was a problem in more complex models, e. g., when allowing three separate cell death transition rates, or two different polynucleated states. in these models, some parameters could not be reliably estimated due to low cell counts and cell misclassification noise, and they were often shrunk to zero due to the penalized estimation procedure. our model was primarily designed to quantify the phenotypes of a large-scale imaging assay with relatively low temporal resolution and showing a broad variety of dynamic phenotypes. depending on the biological question, more targeted models could be envisioned to focus on certain dynamic aspects, such as introducing different modes of cell death or using a finer model of the mitosis phase.

we applied our model to the mitocheck assay and derived six new phenotypic descriptors not considered in the original analysis: time of quiescence, time of mitotic arrest, time of polynucleation and time of cell death, mitosis duration and interphase duration. we established a list of  <dig> sirnas where these phenotypes could be reliably estimated. this list can be seen as a resource to build new hypotheses on the associations between genes and biological processes. however, due to the possibility of off-target effects of sirna perturbations, unavoidable experimental variability and the use of a cell line with a heavily rearranged genome, for general validity these results must be confirmed by independent assays, for instance, rescue experiments in another cell line  <cit> .
