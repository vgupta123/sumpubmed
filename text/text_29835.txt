BACKGROUND
bone formation occurs through two different mechanisms: endochondral and intramembranous ossification. longitudinal growth of the axial and appendicular skeleton is a result of endochondral ossification  that is controlled by the cartilage growth plate  <cit> . eo involves the aggregation of mesenchymal cells to form cartilaginous nodules  <cit> . a subset of the cells in these nodules matures further into growth plate chondrocytes.

during endochondral bone development in the limb, growth plate chondrocytes undergo well-ordered and controlled phases of cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis  <cit> . the growth plate can be divided into three main chondrocyte subpopulations: the resting, proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes. these populations are arranged in distinct zones that are distinguishable by morphological criteria, but are also characterized by specific molecular markers. the proliferation and/or differentiation of these subpopulations are controlled by a complex network of regulatory molecules  <cit> . proliferative chondrocytes synthesize type ii collagen and form characteristic columns; they then exit the cell cycle and become post-mitotic prehypertrophic chondrocytes that differentiate further into hypertrophic cells. hypertrophic chondrocytes express type x collagen and mineralize the surrounding matrix. this differentiation process is followed by apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes, but prior to their death, they deposit vascular endothelial growth factor  into their extracellular matrix, which promotes the invasion of blood vessels into the cartilage tissue. blood vessel invasion enables the recruitment of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and replacement of the cartilage scaffold by a calcified bone matrix  <cit> . this final step results in the formation of trabecular bone . with continuing resorption of the primary spongiosa by osteoclasts, the primary center splits into two opposing growth plates, in each of which the maturation of cartilage and subsequent remodeling into bone continue, as long as new chondrocytes are generated in the growth plates  <cit> .

hypertrophic chondrocytes play a pivotal role in coordinating chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, as they provide a scaffold for subsequent formation of trabecular bone and secrete factors such as vegf that control the activity of other cells involved in eo. therefore, the proper regulation of chondrocyte differentiation and the coordination of chondrocyte progression through the cell cycle have to be tightly regulated for normal bone growth. the induction of growth arrest is a central feature of this phenotypic transition. for example, mice lacking the cyclin dependent-kinase inhibitor p57/kip <dig> exhibit several developmental abnormalities including abnormal skeletogenesis  <cit> . moreover, numerous skeletal diseases are caused by deregulation of cellular proliferation and hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, such as a large number of skeletal dysplasias that are characterized by dwarfism, skeletal deformities, and frequently by early-onset osteoarthritis  <cit> .

both local paracrine regulators and systemic hormones control endochondral bone formation and bone remodeling throughout life. insulin-like growth factor-i  and c-type natriuretic peptide  are among the major stimulators of endochondral bone growth. igf <dig> is the most prominent growth factor involved in linear growth regulation and it was shown to be essential for growth plate chondrocyte development. the most prominent effect of igf <dig> is induction of chondrocyte hypertrophy, as shown both in igf <dig> null mice and in bone cultures treated with igf <dig>  <cit> . in addition, studies from our lab and others identified the cnp pathway as an important anabolic regulator of endochondral bone growth  <cit> . however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating the anabolic effects of both ligands are not completely understood. substantial progress has been made in the past few years in understanding how local signaling molecules, working through key transcription factors such as sox and runx proteins, interact and control the growth and differentiation of bones  <cit> . however, the intracellular signaling pathways connecting extracellular signaling molecules to transcriptional regulators are poorly understood.

here we focus on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases  which represent a family of lipid kinases whose inositol lipid products are key mediators of intracellular signaling in many cell types  <cit> . pi3ks are represented by a family of eight distinct enzymes that can be divided into three classes based on their structure and function  <cit> . class i pi3ks have been the major focus of pi3k studies because these isoforms are generally coupled to extracellular stimuli. the generation of d3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides at the membrane by pi3ks results in the recruitment of certain signaling proteins to the plasma membrane via their pleckstrin homology  domains. as such, pi3ks are upstream regulators in a number of signaling cascades that control proliferation, growth, cell death, migration, metabolism, and a host of other biological responses  <cit> . in addition, the pi3k pathway is known as the major signaling cascade downstream igf <dig> in many cell types  <cit> .

class i pi3ks are reversibly inhibited by the pharmacological compound ly <dig>  and more specifically class i alpha isoforms by pi3-k α inhibitor iv from calbiochem. genetic screens in model organisms have identified akt  as the primary downstream mediator of the effects of pi3k  <cit> . ptdins p <dig> and ptdins p <dig> bind to the ph domain of akt, recruiting the kinase to the plasma membrane where akt is phosphorylated and activated  <cit> . akt has been shown to be a critical mediator of cell proliferation and survival  <cit> . in mice, disruption of the most ubiquitously expressed member of the akt family of genes, akt <dig>  results in body size reduction compared to the wild-type littermates  <cit> .

therefore, the pi3k/akt pathway is involved in proliferation, differentiation, cellular survival or a combination of these processes in multiple cell types, from neurons to fibroblasts  <cit>  but its role in cartilage and bone development has not been studied intensively and is the focus of our study.

RESULTS
ly <dig> suppresses chondrocyte differentiation
micromass cultures were incubated in medium for three days to allow chondrogenic differentiation before addition of the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig>  or dmso  for up to  <dig> more days . pi3k inhibition caused a delay in chondrocyte differentiation, as shown by decreased accumulation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans , decreased mineralization  and less staining for alkaline phosphatase activity compared to cells treated with dmso . alcian blue stain was extracted and quantified spectrophotometrically, confirming a significant decrease in ly <dig> treated micromass cultures at day  <dig> . measurement of hoechst  <dig> fluorescence demonstrated that ly <dig> treatment did not result in significant changes in dna content of cultures . rna was isolated from the micromass cultures at days  <dig> and  <dig> of culture. real-time pcr experiments showed decreased relative levels of collagen ii  and x  transcripts upon pi3k inhibition. these data demonstrate that pi3k activity is required for normal progression of chondrocyte differentiation.

pi3k inhibition results in reduced bone growth
we next investigated the role of pi3k/akt signaling in the three-dimensional context of an intact bone. tibiae were isolated from e  <dig>  mice, measured and then incubated with ly <dig> , pi3-k α inhibitor iv  or dmso for six days. immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in control cultures, phosphorylated akt  proteins  can be found mostly in the late proliferative, prehypertrophic and early hypertrophic areas . p-akt levels were greatly reduced upon pi3k inhibition, demonstrating the efficiency of the inhibitor. the difference between tibia length in the beginning and at the end of the time course represents bone growth. the bones treated with ly <dig> and pi3-k α inhibitor iv showed an average of 45% and 35% reduction in growth compared to tibiae treated with dmso . measurements of both growth plates and the mineralized area showed that the length of the two tibial growth plates  was reduced in the ly <dig> treated bones, whereas the absolute length of the mineralized zone was not affected . pi3-k α inhibitor iv showed similar effects to ly <dig> as observed in the alcian blue/alizarin red stain .

when the three parts of the bone  were calculated as a percentage of the entire length of the bone, we noticed a relative increase in the length of the mineralized zone upon pi3k inhibition .

treatment of tibiae with ly <dig> results in smaller proliferative and hypertrophic zones
histological sections of tibiae from e <dig>  mice, cultured for  <dig> days in the presence of ly <dig>  or dmso, were stained with h&e or safranin o/fast green. growth plate organization and columnar arrangement of cells were not notably different after pi3k inhibition, but we noticed a much smaller hypertrophic zone in ly <dig> treated bones compared to the controls . sections were further analyzed using openlab  <dig> . <dig> software to measure the length of different areas of the growth plate. the hypertrophic  and proliferative  zones of the growth plate of ly <dig> treated tibiae were significantly shorter than in control. the resting zone  was increased in length in ly <dig> treated bones, but this was not found statistically significant .

similar results were found when we calculated the length of the zones reporting the measurements as percentage of the entire growth plate, but in this case the decrease in proliferative zone length was not found to be statistically significant . since ly <dig> had similar effects on the proximal or distal growth plates , zone measurements were performed on the proximal growth plate only.

treatment of tibiae with ly <dig> results in reduced hypertrophic cell size
we next analyzed the effects of ly <dig> on chondrocyte morphology. while resting and proliferative cells did not display obvious differences in cell size or shape under the different conditions, cells in the hypertrophic zone appeared markedly smaller upon pi3k inhibition .

to examine whether the observed effects were specific for the chosen developmental stage, we performed similar experiments with tibiae from e <dig>  mice. tibiae cultured for  <dig> days in the presence of ly <dig> demonstrated decreased length of the growth plate and the hypertrophic zone, similar to e <dig>  tibiae. we also noticed decreased size of hypertrophic cells in the presence of the pi3k inhibitor , demonstrating that the anabolic role of the pi3k pathway is not specific to a certain developmental stage.

decreased markers of chondrocyte differentiation and increased apoptosis in ly <dig> treated growth plates
we next examined molecular markers of chondrocyte differentiation in e <dig>  tibiae cultured for  <dig> days in the presence of ly <dig> or dmso, using immunohistochemistry. the domain of collagen x staining was decreased upon pi3k inhibition , in agreement with the smaller hypertrophic zone observed under these conditions. in addition, expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p <dig> , a marker of postmitotic chondrocytes, was decreased in the ly <dig> treated bones, providing further evidence for decreased and delayed chondrocyte differentiation .

we next examined the effects of pi3k inhibition on chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis. brdu  labeling revealed no significant difference in the percentage of replicating cells within the proliferative zone of the growth plate . treatment of e <dig>  tibiae with ly <dig> or dmso for  <dig> days results in increased number of cells showing positive tunel stain in the hypertrophic zone of ly <dig> treated bones .

igf1-induced bone growth partially requires pi3k activity
we next attempted to identify extracellular signals that control bone growth through the pi3k pathway. igf <dig> is a known anabolic factor for endochondral bones  <cit>  and has been shown to activate pi3k signaling  <cit> . tibiae isolated from e <dig>  mice were cultured in the presence of igf <dig> , ly <dig>  control  in pbs) or igf1+ly <dig>  igf <dig> treatment caused a significant increase in bone growth  . as before, ly <dig> treatment resulted in more than 45% reduction in growth. however, igf <dig> stimulated bone growth to a similar degree in ly <dig> treated bones , with the ratio between the bone growth in the igf <dig> treatment and control  being lower that the ratio between the ly294002+igf <dig> treatment and ly <dig> . there is no significant difference between the control and ly294002+igf <dig> treatment. this suggests that in addition to pi3k, another pathway is required for igf1-induced bone growth. histological investigation demonstrated that igf <dig> induced enlargement of the hypertrophic zone in the absence and presence of ly <dig>  as shown by increased hypertrophic zone length in igf <dig> treatment compared to control and in ly294002+igf <dig> treatment compared to ly <dig> alone .

c-type natriuretic peptide-induced bone growth requires pi3k activity
we next turned our attention to cnp, another potent stimulator of bone growth  <cit> . tibiae were isolated from e <dig>  mice and treated with control , cnp , ly <dig> or cnp+ly <dig>  cnp strongly stimulated bone growth in the absence of ly <dig>  upon pi3k inhibition, cnp-induced bone growth is blocked , with no significant difference between the ly <dig> and ly294002+cnp treatments. similarly to igf <dig>  cnp induces an enlargement of the hypertrophic zone but in this situation it seems to be dependent on pi3k activity, as shown by reduction of the hypertrophic zone length in the cnp+ly <dig> treatment almost to the level of the ly <dig> treatment .

discussion
the pi3k pathway has been shown to affect numerous cellular processes in a tissue-specific fashion; for example, it is required for survival in different cell types such as cardiomyocytes  <cit> , cellular differentiation in the case of osteoclasts and keratinocytes  <cit> , and proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts  <cit> . it also stimulates differentiation of cd4+ t-cells  <cit>  and development and proliferation of b cells  <cit> . we hypothesized that the pi3k pathway has similar effects in the growth plate, promoting endochondral bone growth by increasing proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and by suppressing apoptosis.

we found that inhibition of pi3k with ly <dig> results in decreased differentiation, in both primary chondrocytes  and organ cultures. markers of both early chondrocyte differentiation such as collagen ii and glycosaminoglycans and of late hypertrophic differentiation such as collagen x, p <dig>  alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content  were decreased upon pi3k inhibition. these data suggest that the pi3k pathway is required for normal chondrocyte differentiation. in the organ culture system, we have shown that the pi3k pathway is required for maximal bone growth, since by inhibiting the pathway we obtained 55% reduction in bone growth, due to a proportionate shortening of both growth plates.

the major phenotype of the ly <dig> treated tibiae is represented by a 45% reduction in the length of the hypertrophic zone, providing further evidence that the pi3k pathway is required for hypertrophic differentiation. the observed reduction in the area staining for collagen x and p <dig> in ly <dig> treated tibiae is in agreement with reduced hypertrophy. in addition we have seen a 20% reduction of the length of the proliferative area of the growth plate, in ly <dig> treated tibiae. in the organ culture system it seems that the onset of proliferation is delayed, since the resting zone represents a higher percentage of the growth plate in the ly <dig> treated bones compared to control. the ratio of brdu labeled cells within the proliferative zone of the growth plate does not appear to be different between ly <dig> and control cultures, suggesting that pi3k inhibition results in delayed cell cycle entry, but does not affect the rate of cell cycle progression once cells have entered to proliferative zone. our data also show increased apoptosis in organ cultures treated with ly <dig>  apoptosis was only detected in the hypertrophic and mineralized zones, suggesting that the pi3k pathway is required for hypertrophic chondrocyte survival.

pi3k signaling transduces signals from many growth factors and other extracellular cues, but it is not known which of them utilizes the pathway for anabolic effects on endochondral bones. potential candidates are igfs, however, our data suggest, somewhat unexpectedly that igf <dig> stimulates organ culture growth in the presence of ly <dig> to a similar degree as in control cultures. igf <dig> treatment causes an increase in the length of hypertrophic zone  <cit> , and this increase is not completely blocked by the pi3k inhibitor. this suggests that the pi3k pathway is not the only and potentially not the major pathway required for igf1-induced bone growth and -hypertrophic differentiation in our organ culture system.

one potential problem that could partially explain the lack of growth reduction in the igf <dig> + ly <dig> treatment is that igf <dig> possibly increased akt phosphorylation to a level that is no longer completely inhibited by  <dig> μm ly <dig>  the mechanisms for igf <dig> and cnp regulation of the pi3k pathway in growth plate chondrocytes are not the focus of this manuscript, but we plan to investigate the implications of these two growth factors in more depth in future studies. it will be important to see the levels of phosphorylated akt in all treatment combinations, by performing immunohistochemistry and western blotting with protein isolated directly from the tibiae treated with all treatment combinations . in addition, future measurements of growth plate zones under all conditions might provide an explanation for the sustained anabolic effects of igf1even in the presence of ly <dig>  our results have shown that the pi3k pathway is mostly involved in hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, and also that the two ligands igf <dig> and cnp increase the length of hypertrophic zone . there were no obvious effects on the other zones, but performing growth plate zone measurements and molecular analyses  might bring additional information in the future.

it will also be of interest to determine which other pathways mediate anabolic activities of igfs in cartilage; the other major signaling pathway implicated in igf signaling in other cells, the mek-erk  cascade, has been shown to suppress endochondral bone growth  <cit>  and is therefore an unlikely candidate for this role.

surprisingly, c-type natriuretic peptide , which is not a known pi3k activator, was found to partially require pi3k activity to stimulate bone growth. the cnp-induced growth of cultured tibiae was blocked by the pi3k inhibitor. one interesting finding was that the effect of cnp on hypertrophy – a significant increase in the hypertrophic zone length  <cit>  – was inhibited by ly <dig>  these data identify cnp as one signal requiring pi3k activity in cartilage, but there are other potential candidates for regulation of the pi3k pathway in endochondral bone growth, such as pthrp  and integrin ligands. studies are under way in our laboratory to identify physiological activators of pi3k signaling in cartilage.

the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of pi3k signaling in endochondral bone growth remain to be identified. we show that akt proteins are phosphorylated under control conditions, and that this activation is reduced under pi3k inhibition, resulting in reduced bone growth, in agreement with reduced growth in akt1-deficient mice as well as mice deficient in multiple akt genes <cit> . the pi3k/akt pathway was shown to be involved in runx <dig>  -dependent osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation in  <dig> cell lines, mc3t3-e <dig> and atcdc <dig>  respectively  <cit> . therefore it represents a candidate for the pi3k involvement in chondrocyte hypertrophy. further investigations of the pi3k/akt mechanisms of chondrocyte differentiation are necessary in order to find the direct targets of this signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that pi3k is required for normal growth plate chondrocyte differentiation and survival in vitro, and therefore for endochondral bone growth. future studies are required to further analyze the mechanisms by which pi3k exerts these effects, investigating both the molecules downstream of pi3k and the upstream activators of the pathway, and the mechanisms used by these molecules in order to function within the pi3k/akt pathway.
