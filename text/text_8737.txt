BACKGROUND
a diagnostic feature of alzheimer’s disease  is aggregation of toxic amyloid β peptide  into extracellular plaques, suspected of causing or contributing to disease progression  <cit> . in addition, intracellular aβ has been implicated as having a pathological role in ad and down syndrome  <cit> , and aβ may function as a transcription factor   <cit> . aβ is cleaved from a larger precursor protein  by a process involving two secretase enzymes, β-secretase and γ-secretase  <cit> . hyperphosphorylated τ protein and α-synuclein also have a likely role in ad etiology  <cit> , and apolipoprotein e  is linked to a large proportion of cases of ad both by genetic  <cit>  and cholesterol-related functional studies  <cit> . we hypothesize that unusually high production of aβ significantly contributes to ad, and this aberrant aβ production can result from unusually high app gene  expression, particularly in a tissue and cell-type specific manner.

several groups have studied the 5′-flanking region of the app gene, including its promoter  <cit> . serial deletion analysis has shown that the app promoter  <cit>  and 5′-utr  <cit>  contain several regulatory elements that are likely to modulate transcriptional activity. in addition to proximal regulatory regions, two upstream sequences have been identified that regulate the gene’s expression  <cit> , including one that has been shown to generally stimulate app production  <cit> . the app promoter is regulated by a variety of factors. it can be stimulated by nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l  <cit> , and copper depletion downregulates its activity  <cit> . a link between app gene regulation and pathologies such as ad has been shown, for example, by characterization of two app promoter polymorphisms associated with the pathogenesis of some forms of ad  <cit> . the more upstream of these two polymorphic sites may function as a target site for aβ acting as a transcription factor  <cit> .

our group has examined regulatory regions of important ad-associated genes, including apoe <cit>  and microtubule-associated protein τ   <cit> . we have also previously characterized a deletion series of the app promoter in eight different cell lines from five different tissue types in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  reporter construct  <cit> . we discovered that a novel  <dig> nucleotide  sequence of − <dig> to − <dig> from the + <dig> transcription start site  had differential effect depending upon cell line. in human kidney epithelial cells, deletion of this element resulted in 50-fold reduction of cat reporter gene activity. in human sk-n-sh neuroblastoma  cells, deletion resulted in a  <dig> to 4-fold gain of reporter gene activity, the greatest nb cell expression for all clones of the deletion series. we thus termed this region the “proximal regulatory element”  of the app gene. we examined the nature of dna-protein interaction with this dna fragment by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay . notably, use of the pre as a probe in emsa showed evidence of dna-protein interaction with this sequence in multiple cell line nuclear extracts and in mouse brain tissue nuclear extract  <cit> . however, the specific nature of nuclear proteins that interact with the pre in different cell types was not determined at that time.

we continue our work on the pre by exploring specific dna-protein interactions in emsa, competition emsa, and antibody-supershift emsa. functional effects were measured by creation of a library of mutant pre sequences within a previously constructed  <cit> app-cat fusion clone. while we had previously shown that the pre interacts with nuclear proteins in a tissue-type specific manner, we herein identified tfs that were likely bind to the pre, specifically activator protein  <dig> , nm <dig> nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein , and specificity protein  <dig> . we also characterized quantitative and qualitative effects of mutating the pre vs. dna-protein interaction in emsa vs. both nb and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma  cells and cell nuclear extracts. functional assays of pre mutation effects were performed by transiently transfecting the mutant-cat clones into human neuroblastoma and rat neuronal pheochromocytoma cell cultures. we discovered specific, significant mutation-dependent function differences. we compared the emsa results to effects of the same mutations in functional mutant-cat clone transfection assays. altering the pre’s ability to bind tf corresponded to functional changes in promoter activity in a cell line-specific manner.

we determined that puf and sp <dig> are candidates for regulation of the app gene through the pre. puf’s better-known function is as an inhibitor of metastasis  <cit> . sp <dig> activity in app regulation has already been well demonstrated  <cit> . sp <dig> sites have been located in both the promoter  <cit>  and 5′-utr portions of the app 5′-flanking region  <cit> . our data led us to propose that sp <dig> and puf act antagonistically through the pre, with sp <dig> stimulating and puf repressing app transcription. these two tf sites can be subject to natural variation in the human genome, as they cross a known single nucleotide polymorphism   <cit> . the pre sequence contains sites for dna methylation and oxidation, suggesting the site may be vulnerable to environmentally-mediated epigenetic modification. should such interference with puf regulation of app increase risk of ad, it would be another similarity between etiology of sporadic/idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders and oncogenesis, extending our previous work in developing the latent early-life associated regulation  model  <cit>  of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders.

RESULTS
putative transcription factor sites within the pre
the pre with an additional 10nt flanking sequence at either end was used with tess  <cit>  and matinspector  <cit>  to probe the transfac database  <cit> . restricting predicted sites to mammal tf matrices and eliminating redundant sites resulted in predicted affinities with several transcription factors , including ap <dig>  gata binding proteins  <dig>  and  <dig> , two gc boxes, paired box gene 4-a , puf, epstein-barr virus transcription factor r , sp <dig>  and transcription elongation regulator  <dig> . truncated upstream stimulatory factor  <dig> and usf <dig> sites were also found at the 3′-end of the pre. the gc box is associated with the binding of several transcription factors, including sp <dig>  basic transcription element binding protein  <dig>  bteb <dig>  and msh homeobox  <dig> .

dna-protein interaction of the pre by emsa varies among tissue types and cell line conditions
to investigate cell type specificity of pre-protein interactions, we used the pre fragment in emsa with nuclear extracts from pc <dig> and human cervical epithelial , sk-n-be neuroblastoma , and histiocytic lymphoma  cells  and with nuclear extracts from human tissues . pc <dig> extracts  were obtained from both normal and hypoxic cells . u <dig> extracts  included nuclei from untreated cells and from cells treated with interferon -γ, 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , or tpa + ifn-γ . in addition, to test specificity of pre binding with untreated u <dig> extracts, we also competed the pre/u <dig> emsa against 200x molar excess unlabeled pre fragment . nuclear extract emsa showed definite interaction between the pre and both pc <dig> and u <dig> extracts. this interaction was competed away with excess pre in u <dig> extracts. dna-protein interactions could be altered by specific treatment of cells from which extracts were taken. hypoxia greatly reduced the observed interaction in pc <dig> extracts . treatment with the cytokine ifn-γ may have slightly increased interaction in u <dig> extracts , but tpa treatment seems to have produced a stronger result . combined tpa+ifn-γ treatment  reduced dna-protein interaction levels, suggesting that more than one pathway may be involved in interaction with the pre and that these interactions may compete with each other.

to narrow down candidate transcription factors predicted by tess we conducted emsa with 200x molar excess of unlabeled oligomer pairs known to bind the transcription factors activator protein  <dig> , ap <dig>  and sp <dig>  respectively. in addition, to demonstrate that the truncated usf <dig> site at the 3′-end of the pre is not active, we competed against an unlabeled commercial oligomer pair known to bind usf <dig> . two assays were carried out under the same conditions, one each with nuclear extracts from nb  and hela  cells, respectively. in nb extracts, competition against ap <dig>  sp <dig>  and usf <dig> binding oligomer pairs  showed no difference with the uncompeted lane sample . competition with unlabeled pre eliminated dna-protein interactions , while competition with ap2-binding oligomer pair reduced but did not eliminate interaction, suggesting that pre interaction in neuronal cells may operate through more than one pathway or at least with more than one potential transcription factor.

competition emsa in hela extracts was in tpa-treated extracts . comparing untreated hela nuclear extracts with tpa-treated extracts revealed that tpa induction changed dna-protein interactions with the pre . competition with the pre nearly eliminated dna-protein interaction . competition with oligomer pairs that bind ap <dig>  and ap <dig>  partially reduced dna-protein interaction. competition with the usfl-binding oligomer pairs showed little difference to uncompeted tpa-treated extracts . these results indicate that the pre may interact with ap <dig>  at the very least, but ap <dig> is neither the sole interaction partner for the pre in neuronal cells nor under phorbol ester induction.

to directly explore tissue specificity of pre interaction with factors present specifically in whole-tissue human organs in addition to cell cultures, we also carried out emsa of the pre fragment in human brain, heart, liver, and lung nuclear extracts. two of the four extracts tested formed dna-protein complexes with the pre, specifically lung and brain extracts . this suggests that the pre is likely to have tissue-specific function in vivo, in addition to what may be suggested by cell culture results, and that the brain is at least one center of such affinity.

dna-protein interactions in nb nuclear extracts is tf specific by gel supershift emsa
for further information on specific nuclear factors that would interact with the pre, we performed supershift emsa with radiolabeled pre oligomer pairs in nb nuclear extracts . extracts were either untreated or co-incubated with antibodies against nuclear factors ap <dig>  ap <dig>  puf, sp <dig>  or combined ap <dig> + puf. as negative controls, we incubated nb extracts with labeled pre oligomer pairs and antibodies against usf <dig> or usf <dig> 

incubation of pre oligomers with nb extracts was not altered by co-incubation with anti-ap <dig> , primarily consisting of a single band. as predicted, anti-ap <dig> and anti-puf each altered binding of the pre with nb extracts . in addition to reducing the major dna-protein interaction of un-competed pre , new dna-protein interactions  became visible when anti-ap <dig> was co-incubated. co-incubation with anti-puf produced a similar pattern to anti-ap <dig>  with an additional band . of particular interest is that co-incubation with both antibodies reduced dna-protein interaction more than did incubation with either antibody alone, and completely eliminated the interaction at band iii .

co-incubation with anti-sp <dig> produced a more classic “shift” response . co-incubation with anti-usf <dig>  did not result in any changes. co-incubation with anti-usf <dig>  on the other hand, produced a response similar to that found with anti-ap <dig> or anti-puf. in addition, band ii appears, but this band may also be already present but masked by the breadth of band iii in untreated reactions. close examination of lane i indicates that the interaction at band vi may also be present in untreated reactions. bands iv and v, on the other hand, do not appear when the pre is incubated with nb extracts in the absence of antibody or in the presence of ap <dig>  sp <dig>  or usf <dig> antibodies. these results indicate that ap <dig>  puf, sp <dig>  and usf <dig> are all potential candidates for interaction with the pre.

southwestern blotting with the pre shows different dna-protein interactions among different cell lines and conditions
to ascertain sizes of proteins that participate in some of the observed interactions with the pre, we performed southwestern blotting with nuclear extracts from nb, pc <dig>  hela and tpa-treated hela cells . probing with radiolabeled pre oligomer pairs revealed that dna-protein interactions varied among extracts and were subject to induction. nb nuclear extract  had major interactions at approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda . in addition, faint bands appeared at approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda. the pc <dig> nuclear extract  also had a  <dig> kda/ <dig> kda doublet but lacked a  <dig> kda interaction. instead, an interaction at approximately  <dig> kda appears.

pc <dig> also had weaker interactions at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda. hela nuclear extract  shared interactions at approximately  <dig> and between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, with fainter bands at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda. induction of hela with tpa  resolved the 33/ <dig> kda band into a doublet and reduced the strength of weaker interactions. comparison of the observed southwestern bands with molecular weights of predicted transcription factors suggests the possibility that several of the predicted candidate transcription factors may bind to the pre .

these comparisons were based on a ±10% adjustment to the calculated southwestern band kda. of the potential dna-tf interactions, several appear for all nuclear extracts. these are ap <dig>  msx <dig>  and usf <dig>  a few are unique to human neuroblastoma nuclear extracts, specifically pax4a, usf <dig>  and bteb <dig>  there is no signal that can be assigned to puf subunits, which would be around 17kda in weight. this may be an artifact of the specific gel’s polyacrylamide percentage. however, the band vi/vii doublet could correspond to puf dimers. in general, the southwestern does not exclude conclusions of our emsa-based assays.

mutating the pre alters dna-protein interaction
to more specifically determine those sequences within the pre that participate in gene regulation, we had synthesized a series of oligomer pairs that deleted one or more of the transcription factor sites we predicted to be in the pre. these mutant oligomers were used for emsa  in both nb  and pc <dig>  cell nuclear extracts. mutations resulted in both quantitative and qualitative alterations in dna-protein interaction as determined by emsa. densitometry scans revealed that, at least for some mutants, such as m <dig>  two partially overlapping bands appeared , and the wildtype oligomer pair has an extended trailing end to its peak, suggesting that wildtype binding is to more than one interaction partner. semi-quantitative analysis, therefore, was done for all samples on each individual peak .

starkly visible qualitative differences were restricted to mutants m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  the m <dig> mutants’ predicted binding sites had lower affinity for ap <dig>  gata <dig>  puf, one of the two predicted sp <dig> transcription factor sites, and a downstream gc box. the m <dig> mutant is predicted to lose the shared gata1/gata <dig> site and the downstream sp <dig> site, the m <dig> mutant loses a predicted binding site for zeste homolog/tcerg <dig>  in the case of the first two mutants, the major dna-protein interaction product’s migration was reduced compared to the wildtype oligomer pair’s primary interaction product . analysis of relative migration rates for the wildtype oligomer pair showed that migration of the dna-protein interaction products for m <dig>  and m <dig>  were significantly  reduced from the relative migration rate of wildtype oligomers . the m <dig> mutation  produced two major dna-protein interactions in emsa. the peak of the slower-running interaction was significantly  retarded in pc <dig> but not nb cells.

samples were processed and analyzed in triplicate and films densitometrically scanned. densitometry results were normalized by subtracting the mean peak value for a single film and dividing by standard deviation for the film. for data presentation purposes, this was adjusted by subtracting the standardized value of “wildtype”, which sets “wildtype” value to  <dig> . adjusted data were analyzed by anova followed by dunnett’s two-tailed t. hedges g standard pairwise effect sizes  <cit> , using mean square error for pooled standard deviation, were calculated for each variant vs. wildtype pre .

analysis revealed differences between mutation effects on each band’s signal strengths. specifically, for band i , the m <dig> mutant had significantly higher adjusted signal than wildtype in nb  nuclear extract. m <dig> in nb and pc <dig> extracts had significantly lower adjusted signal than did wildtype . for the dominant wildtype pre emsa band , m <dig> and m <dig> had significantly higher signal than wildtype in nb  and pc <dig>  nuclear extracts, while m <dig> and m <dig> had significantly reduced signal in nb and pc <dig> extracts.

mutating the pre in a reporter gene system produces specific functional differences
to reveal connections between dna-protein interactions and expression in mutations of the pre, we constructed seven plasmids that mutated the pre sequence identically to the mutant pre oligomers. these cons-tructs were all based on pβxbb  <cit> , which contains a promoterless cat gene sequence under the control of an xbai/bamhi fragment of the rhesus monkey app gene promoter and 5′-utr, specifically −309/+ <dig>  with + <dig> being the transcription start site . clones were transfected into pc <dig> and nb cell cultures as described herein. 

elisa results of the functional assay were adjusted for β-gal levels and made relative to wildtype =  <dig>  adjusted results were compared to wildtype by dunnett’s t, and hedges g was calculated for each pairwise comparison . functional mutation effects in nb cells  were distinct from pc <dig> . in nb cells three mutants  had reduced reporter expression compared to wildtype, and mutant m <dig>  had greater adjusted reporter expression than wildtype. in pc <dig> cells, mutants m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> had significantly lower cat protein levels than wildtype. mutating predicted locations of putative transcription factor sites in the pre significantly alters reporter gene expression. these results were consistent between cell lines for the m <dig> and m <dig> mutants.

semiquantitative emsa and elisa specifically correlate by pre mutants
we compared emsa and elisa results by meta-analysis of pairwise hedges g for elisa and emsa results vs. wildtype . for both nb and pc <dig> cells/ nuclear extracts, much weaker correlations were found between emsa band i and elisa signal . stronger correlations existed between emsa band ii and elisa signal in both cell lines . significance was estimated as chance that r ≠  <dig> by bootstrap .

the percent overlap between the two bootstrap distributions within a single cell line was also calculated. the difference between correlations of emsa i to elisa vs. emsa ii to elisa was more distinct in pc <dig> cells, with a 16% overlap between the two bootstrap distributions. in nb cells, the two bootstrap distributions overlapped by 34%. while there may be some indication of a direct relationship between emsa band ii signal and reporter elisa results, we suggest caution in interpreting correlation meta-analysis. in addition to modest, at best, estimations of significance, emsa bands i and ii did not distinctly resolve on autoradiographs in many variants we studied, including wildtype . in addition, cell cultures used for elisa and nuclear extracts used for emsa did not come from the same specific cultures. even with bootstrap estimation, they essentially represent correlations of averaged results from each assay. nevertheless, we accept the possibility that some correspondence exists between altering the strength of the major dna-protein interaction for the wildtype olig-omer pair  and functional effects in reporter fusion assay.

mutating the pre produces cell line-specific and inducible effects, as measured by emsa
to further investigate possible cell line/type-specific effects of the pre, three mutants, specifically m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig>  plus the wildtype pre, were used as probes in emsa with nuclear extracts from nb, pc <dig>  human glioblastoma-astrocytoma , hela or mouse embryo fibroblast  cells. in addition, these oligomers were assayed with emsa with nuclear extracts from hela, or nih3t <dig> cells that had been subject to induction conditions, such as tpa treatment, serum starvation or induction with cytokines such as interleukin- <dig>  or transforming growth factor β  . three apparent bands, marked n , i, and ii, appeared among the various nuclear extracts, although no extract/mutant combination had all three bands. in nuclear extracts from nb cells , dna-protein interactions were obtained as reported in  <dig> . wildtype oligomers produced a single strong interaction . the m <dig> and m <dig> oligomer pairs each had an interaction that migrated more slowly than did the wildtype , while m <dig> had a mixed interaction, with bands that migrated both at the same rate as produced by wildtype and as by m <dig>  oligomer pairs. the pc <dig> extracts  produced a pattern similar to that found with nb extracts, excepting that the dna-protein interaction with m <dig>  has a stronger “leading” edge to its band while the interaction with m <dig> has a weaker “trailing” peak in the band doublet .

interactions observed with u <dig> extracts  bore some resemblance to those observed with nb and pc <dig> nuclear extracts specifically for wildtype  and m <dig> . however, the m <dig> and m <dig> dna-protein interactions  were noticeably different from both nb and pc <dig>  dna-protein interactions seen with untreated hela nuclear extracts  did not apparently vary among pre variants, but treatment of hela with tpa  resulted in a pattern of interactions that was more similar to those with nb and pc <dig> extracts.

untreated hela  dna-protein interactions were unlike those found in the other cell lines surveyed. they had an additional band that migrated more slowly than seen for other cell line nuclear extracts. interaction was very weak with the wildtype oligomer , and it appeared as a doublet. the m <dig> mutant’s interaction was a single band , while m <dig> and m <dig> interactions were doublets .

serum starvation of nih3t <dig>  may have slightly reduced interaction with the m <dig> mutant  but appeared to have no other effect. treatment of nih3t <dig> with il <dig>  increases dna-protein interaction with the m <dig> oligomer . of particular interest, treatment of nih3t <dig> with tgfβ  brought about a dramatic shift in dna-protein interaction bands for the wildtype pre and all three mutants. while interaction was visibly weaker than for other nih3t <dig> based extracts, it very closely resembled that seen for normal nb  and pc <dig>  extracts.

the pre is well-conserved within the human genome and throughout eutherian mammals
to explore the possibility that the pre is well-conserved, we examined genomic sequences identified or putatively identified as proximally upstream of the app gene of  <dig> mammal species that were aligned by webprank <cit>  as described herein. information of the alignment was calculated in bits  <cit>  and averaged in a window of  <dig> nt, which roughly corresponds to the distance between nucleosomes in chromosomal dna as described herein. examination of the alignment as a whole revealed that the pre was well conserved compared to immediately flanking sequences. adding non-primate sequences to the alignment did not change average information content immediately around the pre , but average information content for the alignment dropped off significantly  when on either side of the pre. information inversely expresses homogeneity, since 100% homogeneity at a given base is maximum possible score  and equal distribution of all four bases would be  <dig> bits. 

phylogenetic comparison of the alignment  led, as expected, to rejection of the molecular clock hypothesis . dna changes observed within the, admittedly short, region are unlikely to occur simply through neutral sequence drift. of particular interest is that most of the primate sequences appeared to have a slower-than-typical rate of change vs. the overall tree while mouse and rat sequences had a faster-than-typical rate of change. further detailed examination was done of the alignment region immediately surrounding the pre . alignment was guided by a tree  based on current conventional mammal phylogeny  <cit> , as suggested by the webprank protocol. sequences were taxonomically weighted as described herein and homologies between the human sequence vs. other primates, euarchontoglires, boreoeutheria, eutheria, and all mammals were calculated for the aligned pre, as were sequence logos  <cit>  for these groups . the pre remains fairly stable throughout the eutheria, with no less than  <dig> % weighted homology to the human sequence . adding marsupials to the estimation reduces homology to  <dig> %. greater aggregate distance from primates also associates with lower specificity within the pre —total information content  drops from  <dig>  for primates  to  <dig>  when all mammal sequences are considered . of particular interest, the overlapping sp1/puf site within the pre is also well conserved among placental mammals . however, the site breaks down when marsupial sequences are included . marsupials also have a 9– <dig> base insertion within the pre .

discussion
the app gene consists of  <dig> exons and spans more than  <dig> kilobases on human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . we hypothesize that unusually high production of aβ may contribute to ad, and this aberrant aβ production can be a result of unusually high app gene expression. the app gene is a likely locus for sporadic, late-onset ad, the most common form of the disease  <cit> . down syndrome patients invariably develop ad, which may be due to additional gene dose of the app gene in the down critical region of chromosome  <dig>  in addition, cases of late-onset ad have increased plasma levels of the forms of aβ  <cit>  specifically associated with the disease. tissue and cell-type specific expression of the app gene may also play a role in app protein or aβ-related pathogenesis. it is well established that mutations in the app coding sequence can cause autosomal dominant early onset fad  <cit> . some analyses of the coding sequence  <cit>  and the promoter  <cit>  rejected other app polymorphisms as predisposing to late onset ad . however, there are reports of promoter polymorphisms that increase risk for ad in a non-autosomal fashion  <cit> , particularly of two polymorphisms in the app promoter associated with ad pedigrees  <cit> .

in addition, the following results strongly implicate the role of promoter elements in ad. 1) in a genome screen of  <dig> sib-pairs with load, hardy’s group identified  <dig> loci with lod-scores > <dig> including a region on chromosomes  <dig>  <cit> . 2) using non-parametric linkage methods, duke’s group showed that a locus predisposing to load might reside in this region of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . 3) levels of aβ correlate to cognitive decline in predementia and dementia  <cit> . 4) genetic analysis of a case of ds due to non-disjunction suggested triplication of app in the pathogenesis of ad in down syndrome  <cit> . 5) younkin’s group analyzed plasma aβ in  <dig> first-degree relatives of load patients and in  <dig> age-matched controls. this analysis showed highly significant increase in plasma aβ40/ <dig> in the relatives as compared to controls  <cit> .

serial deletion analysis of the app promoter has revealed several regulatory elements  <cit> . the app promoter is regulated by several factors, including but not necessarily limited to nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and interleukin-l  <cit> . copper depletion downregulates app promoter activity  <cit> . various groups have reported other transcriptional elements within the first  <dig> nt from tss of the app gene  <cit> . this includes regulation of app promoter expression by two gc-elements  <cit> , the zinc finger protein ctcf  <cit> , and upstream stimulatory factor  <cit> .

we previously reported discovering a  <dig> nt  fragment from a deletion series of the app promoter with different effects depending upon cell line  <cit> . our discovery was independently paralleled by other workers, who have noted a fragment of the app promoter at −55/− <dig> by dnase protection assay. this fragment was predicted to contain ap <dig> and ap <dig> binding sites, but both were experimentally excluded  <cit> . furthermore, deletion of a −54/− <dig> fragment of the app promoter resulted in reduced expression of reporter fusion clones  <cit> . in addition, deletion of a −77/− <dig> fragment resulted in reduced reporter fusion expression in rat primary embryonic hippocampal neurons  <cit> , which was similar to our own observation of the effect of deleting the pre in rodent cell lines and opposite what we observed in human cell lines  <cit> . this other work essentially concluded that usf was the responsible agent for regulation through this app promoter fragment, although it did propose but not test a putative sp <dig> binding site. we do not dispute that usf may play an important role in app proximal protein regulation but investigate the possibility that other factors and cofactors also operate on this sequence.

we sought to more fully characterize the activity of the pre as a component of the 5′-flanking region of the app gene. transcription factor binding activity was studied by emsa with human tissue nuclear extracts, including extracts from human brain, followed by emsa in four different cell line nuclear extracts under different conditions of stimulation or induction. binding of specific tfs was tested by competition emsa and by antibody-supershift emsa. we also used southwestern blotting to estimate molecular weights of interaction partners with the pre and compared these with candidate transcription factors.

we have determined that the pre has tissue specificity, showing greater dna-protein interaction with brain and lung extracts than with liver or heart extracts. in addition, the pre has cell line-specific dna-protein interactions with cell nuclear extracts, differing among u <dig>  hela, u <dig>  pc <dig>  nih3t <dig> cell lines. these interactions are subject to reduction, elimination, or qualitative change by conditions such as hypoxia, sr, and induction with tpa or ifn-γ), il <dig>  or tgfβ. our results suggest that the −76/− <dig> region binds to a protein that is upregulated in serum starvation, and downregulated in hypoxia. because serum starvation contributes to the induction of apoptosis, these results suggest a role of the 30-nt proximal app promoter element in enhanced apoptotic neuronal cell death.

competition emsa and antibody-supershift emsa confirmed predicted interactions between the pre and ap <dig>  while antibody-supershift emsa confirmed interaction between the pre and ap <dig>  puf, sp <dig>  and usf <dig>  competition and supershift emsa appear to contradict each other regarding sp <dig>  possible biological explanations could include sufficiently high affinity within the pre for sp <dig> to overcome competition with the particular commercial probe used. high pre-sp <dig> affinity could result in a “negative” competition result but a positive supershift, since the supershift is meant to detect sp <dig> when bound to the target dna. alternatively, our supershift may be interacting with an sp1-like transcription factor that binds the pre but has a lower affinity with the consensus sp <dig> site in the commercial competition oligomer. southwestern blotting indicated possible interactions between the pre and ap <dig>  sp <dig>  and usf <dig>  among other tf. it also admitted the possibility of pre-puf dimer interaction.

we mutated the pre and highlighted a specific effect of the sequence that included the predicted puf/sp <dig> binding site. our mutant expression evidence tends to agree with our emsa evidence. of the mutants characterized, m <dig> was the most consistent in response across nb and pc12x cells and nuclear extracts. specifically, semi-quantitative emsa with m <dig> probe resulted in significant signal loss at the band position that corresponded closely to the major band of wildtype pre emsa in both nb and pc <dig> nuclear extracts. likewise, m <dig> mutant promoter/reporter expression clones resulted in significantly reduced levels of cat reporter protein in both nb and pc <dig> cells. the m <dig> mutant deleted the predicted puf site and both predicted sp <dig> sites in the pre.

we note that m <dig> and m <dig> each also deleted a single predicted sp <dig> site, the specific site differing between m <dig> and m <dig>  emsa analysis of these two mutants showed that m <dig> consistently had reduced emsa interaction at band ii, while m <dig> did not. however, cat reporter levels were not consistently altered between cell types. there-fore, our mutation analysis confirms our earlier conclusion that the pre is most likely to function as a site of puf and sp <dig> activity. disruption of the shared puf/sp <dig> site in our system resulted in reduced levels of reporter gene product, which appears to contradict part of our proposed model. however primary sequence disruption of the site would influence both puf  and sp <dig>  interaction very strongly. in addition, disruption of the ap <dig> site also resulted in loss of emsa signal, suggesting that the pre may also function under induction as well as constitutively.

currently, two dna sequence polymorphisms have been reported for the pre, specifically rs <dig> and rs <dig>  <cit> . each is predicted to alter potential tf binding sites within the pre . of particular note, rs <dig> may interfere with the puf site. in addition, potentially interesting sites were created, including glucocorticoid/progesterone receptor , nf1-like enkephalin nuclear transcription factor  <dig>  retinoic acid receptor γ , and zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox  <dig> ,. glucocorticoid levels are well associated with ad risk  <cit> . progesterone supplementation has been linked to more rapid age-related cognitive decline in post-menopausal women  <cit> . elevated levels of enkephalin contribute to neurological impairment and tau phosphorylation in ad model animals  <cit> . upregulation of enkephalin accompanied by upregulation of app due to an snp in the pre may overwhelm natural defenses against neurodegeneration. rars direct app processing toward the non-pathogenic α pathway  <cit> , and it is conceivable that a feedback mechanism that results in rar-mediated overproduction of app in a natural pre mutant may overwhelm this process. zeb <dig> interacts with tgfβ  <cit> , and tgfβ is implicated in ad pathogenesis  <cit> . the rs <dig> snp approximates our m <dig> mutant, while rs <dig> approximates m <dig>  combining both polymorphisms approximates the tf deletion effects of m <dig>  which showed significant bonferroni-adjusted reductions in both emsa and cat reporter by meta-analysis. population frequency of these snps has not been published, and it has not been yet determined if they occur as a haplotype or independently. it should be cautioned that, although they have interesting potential tf site changes, functional association with any disease state has also not been determined. 

atwo distinct gc boxes were identified in the wildtype pre sequence and are designated as “i” and “ii”.

btwo distinct sp <dig> sites in addition to the gc boxes were identified in the wildtype pre sequence and are designated as “i” and “ii”.

the pre is strongly conserved in placental mammals, particularly the puf/sp <dig> overlapping site. in addition, this conservation occurs in a promoter region that has undergone significant non-neutral  change. in particular, primate and mouse/rat sequences diverge the most from each other in our root-to-tip ana-lysis, but with far less difference when considering the pre, specifically. we propose that this particular short segment of the app proximal regulatory region has been specifically maintained, as would be expected of an active promoter segment. we have previously stated that other ad-associated gene promoters, such as for apoe, have important differences between mouse and human  <cit> . likewise, we have reported both differences and similarities between human and rat cell line responses to functional promoter deletion clones of the human mapt promoter  <cit> . such overall differences can be put to use in identifying potentially critical regions of similarity, such as the pre within the app promoter.

although two snps have been reported in the human pre, it is unlikely, given their obscurity in the literature, that these would be common enough to explain a large proportion of sporadic ad. we propose that the majority of etiologically important puf vs. sp <dig> disruption in the pre would be due to environmental influences on epigenetic markers. the naturally-occurring snps could serve as a potential test bed, given their similarity in terms of tf site disruption to some of our synthetic mutants. it is potentially more interesting that the puf/sp <dig> site consists primarily of gg and ggg sequences, which are particularly vulnerable to dna oxidation  <cit> . while sp <dig> activity is sensitive to epigenetic dna modification  <cit> , and puf operates in repair of dna damage  <cit> , relative effects of dna oxidation upon each protein’s activity as a transcription factor have not been established. likewise, cpg dimers  are immediately adjacent to the puf/sp <dig> site. thus, in our system, while disrupting both puf and sp <dig> activity by primary sequence mutation may result in overall reduction in reporter levels, environmentally-induced epigenetic alterations to the shared target dna sequence may favor sp <dig> stimulation over puf inhibition. in light of the knowledge that overall puf activity may be reduced in ad, we do not suggest that epigenetic modification of the pre would be the sole cause of the disorder. rather, it would contribute to disruption of normal app gene expression that would accompany ad. feedback mechanisms between app and other misregulated ad associated genes may serve to also reduce puf activity in concert with direct disruption of app-puf interaction. we admit that our current assignment of puf and sp <dig> to active status within the pre has not yet been directly tested.

mammalian puf is associated with inhibition of invasive metastasis  <cit>  and stimulation of normal cell proliferation  <cit> . puf kinase activity was reduced in human brain in alzheimer’s disease and down syndrome  <cit> . total app mrna is elevated in ad brain, specifically kpi isoforms  <cit> . app gene expression and sp <dig> activity are increased in aging primate brains  <cit> . sp1-dna interaction and app expression in mouse brains are increased in a latent fashion by early-life dietary administration of pb  <cit> . we suggest an antagonistic role between puf and sp <dig>  specifically that puf may serve to downregulate app gene expression via the pre in vivo, and increases in effective sp <dig> activity, due to increased sp <dig> levels, interference in puf-dna interaction at the pre, or decrease in puf levels, for example, may overwhelm puf regulation.

the puf transcription factor/kinase was discovered in the context of inhibiting metastasis  <cit> . such inhibition included through interaction with the myc gene promoter  <cit> . later, puf was determined to also function as a kinase independently of its tf activity  <cit> . puf tf activity was determined to not only act to inhibit metastasis, but to also operate in non-metastatic cell proliferation  <cit> . in addition to cell proliferative activity, puf regulates insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells  <cit> , providing another molecular link underlying the recently-proposed metabolic-cognitive syndrome that may unite metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . we propose that these aspects of puf may prove important in understanding both ad pathogenesis and the possibility that a role may be played by app gene products in oncogenesis. of greater interest is that puf has already been indirectly linked to ad before our work with the pre. puf interacts with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii inhibitor  <dig>   <cit> . camk2n <dig> is, itself, a potent inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii , which is a mediator of learning and memory  <cit> . camk <dig> is currently a target of several anti-ad drugs under investigation  <cit> .

of particular note is that the pre exists within a dnase i hypersensitive region  <cit> , and puf activity is modulated by the presence or absence of a dnase i hypersensitive region  <cit> . likewise, among its amazing variety of functions  <cit> , the app protein is a ferroxidase and activates ferroportin to export iron from neurons  <cit> . iron chelation reduces app protein levels through the app mrna 5’-utr  <cit> , and this is reversed by iron supplementation. conversely, overexpression of app results in reduced iron content and increased oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . although it has also been shown that abnormally high levels of iron accumulate in specific brain regions in ad, particularly within and around amyloid plaques  <cit> , this is not paradoxical, since plaque-associated iron would be extracellular and could be in part due to overactivity of app in iron transport. in addition, faulty iron metabolism has been strongly linked to cancer and neoplasia, specifically through ferroportin activity  <cit> , and increased serum iron is associated with greater risk for oxidative damage to dna  <cit> . of particular interest for a possible oncology/app association is that expression of the app gene in response to iron chelators distinctly differed between neoplastic and normal cell lines  <cit> . in cancer patients, increased app gene expression was more common in tumor tissue of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients than in non-cancerous matched tissue samples. more importantly, in those patients who had elevated app expression, survival at  <dig> months was 48% vs. 82% for patients with non-elevated app expression  <cit> . this suggests that puf may exert anti-metastatic properties by, in part, altering levels of app expression, reducing overall results of app protein’s ferroxidase activity and modulating cancer risk.

basal activity of the app promoter is greatest in neural origin cell lines, and several promoter elements close to the pre are important for this activity  <cit> . for example, the app promoter contains binding sites for important tfs, such as purine-rich element binding protein-α   <cit>  and early growth response  <dig>   <cit> . notably, there is a high expression of purα and egr <dig> in neurons during brain development and in the adult brain, and negative regulation of app gene expression by purα  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
interference with tf binding to the pre in the context of the complete app promoter could serve to deregulate app production. deletion of the pre from a complete series of app promoter clones resulted in a  <dig> to  <dig> fold gain of promoter activity in nb cells as measured by levels of reporter gene product  <cit> . while ap <dig> and usf <dig>  are generally stimulatory factors, the normal function of puf is usually inhibitory of pathogenic cell proliferation, specifically metastasis  <cit> .

in addition to inhibiting metastasis, puf serves to induce normal cell proliferation  <cit> . the app protein, among its non-pathological functions, is active in the “neuronal pruning” stage of brain development, wherein neurons in the early brain are selectively removed after rapid proliferation  <cit> . in addition to neurogenesis, puf homologues regulate early morphological development  <cit> . thus, as puf serves to stimulate non-pathogenic cell proliferation, and app can act to reduce cell proliferation, it is reasonable to propose the possibility that puf acts to downregulate app expression under normal circumstances, and interference in puf regulation through the pre could serve to deregulate app gene expression, potentially contributing to ad pathogenesis . aβ is a minority product of app processing  <cit> . therefore, increase in app levels could raise aβ above a risk threshold for ad. a theoretical union of oncogenic and neurodegenerative models has been proposed in the latent early-life associated regulation  model of idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorders  <cit> , expands and extends the “n-hit” model of pathogenesis commonly accepted in oncology to “sporadic” neurodegenerative disorders. given that the predicted puf site may be structurally vulnerable to gg oxidation, and thus subject to the learn model, we conclude that our work suggests connections between processes that lead to cancer etiology and sporadic neurobiological disorders, both conceptually  and mechanistically .
