BACKGROUND
breast cancer is caused by genetic and epigenetic alterations of the genome, resulting in changes in expression levels of certain genes  <cit> . in the past two decades, extensive efforts have been undertaken to characterize genes involved in breast cancer development. genomic alterations and gene expression signatures associated with breast cancer and chemotherapy response have been identified  <cit> . however, genes that are neither mutated nor changed in their levels of expression may also play crucial roles in the progression of breast cancer. one way to identify such essential genes is the inhibition of their expression via rna interference  followed by the analysis of the resulting 'loss-of-function' phenotype. rnai screens are commonly used to analyze gene function in a variety of model organisms, the most popular ones being c. elegans and drosophila  <cit> . more recently, shrna libraries targeting the human and mouse genome have become available  <cit> . these libraries allow rnai mediated 'loss-of-function' screens in mammalian cell lines. pooled rnai screens have been performed by several groups and revealed a number of cancer cell essential genes  <cit> . the decoding of such pooled rnai screens by means of microarray analysis has been described previously  <cit> . while some groups employed probe sequences complementary to each shrnas' specific  <dig> nt half-hairpin stem sequence  <cit>  others used unique barcode sequences to analyze pooled shrna screens  <cit> . these  <dig> nt barcode sequences were cloned adjacent to each shrna template, allowing the determination of the abundance of individual shrna templates from a complex pool  <cit> . up until now analysis of pooled rnai screens via barcode sequences was performed by probes complementary to the full length barcode. here, we introduce the concept of barcode tiling in order to analyze pooled shrna screens. we synthesized six partially overlapping probe sequences, each  <dig> nucleotides long, complementary to every unique  <dig> nucleotide barcode from the pool . this means that the abundance of each shrna template can be detected from a pool, via hybridization to six different probe sequences rather than just one.

in a series of initial calibration experiments we demonstrate how the barcode tiling approach can quantify the abundance of individual template molecules from a pool of  <dig> shrna expression constructs. we further directly compare this new approach of analyzing pooled rnai screens to the commonly performed analysis via half hairpin probes. we provide evidence that the analysis using barcode tiling probes is not only more sensitive, but also dramatically increases the fraction of analyzable shrnas from a pool as compared to half hairpin probe analysis.

to further assess the performance of the barcode tiling approach for the detection of essential genes in the breast carcinoma cell line mda-mb- <dig>  a negative selection screening system was established. we chose to target anti-apoptotic genes which were previously shown to be expressed in either breast carcinoma tissues or normal human breast. from a pooled rnai screen we identified  <dig> different shrna sequences which were depleted from a pool of lentiviral infected cells over a period of four weeks. finally, eleven potentially inhibitory as well as non-inhibitory shrnas were selected for individual analysis of their effects on the proliferation of the cell line mda-mb- <dig>  validation assays revealed the genes birc <dig>  brca <dig>  hspa <dig> and nup <dig> to be essential for the viability of the cell line.

the precise profiling of essential genes in cancer cell lines together with their expression pattern, genomic mutations and epigenetic status will lead to a more refined picture of the mechanisms underlying cancer development and the means of eradicating it.

RESULTS
half hairpin versus barcode tiling analysis
in order to assess sensitivity, reproducibility as well as limitations of the barcode tiling approach, we prepared four different template pools with engineered concentrations of individual pgipz shrna expression plasmids. the exact composition of the four templates is summarized in table  <dig>  in the reference pool a total of  <dig> expression plasmids were present in equimolar amounts. in the test pools  <dig> -  <dig> only  <dig> constructs constituting subpool- <dig> remained equimolar, while subpools- <dig> to - <dig>  consisting of ten constructs each, were diluted by the factors indicated in table  <dig>  from each of the four pools we separately pcr amplified half hairpin as well as barcode sequences. the resulting pcr product pools were purified, labeled and hybridized to individual dna microarrays. for both, half hairpin pools as well as barcode pools, exactly the same conditions were used for purification, labeling and hybridization. in order to equalize hybridization properties between barcode tiling probes  and half hairpin probes , we additionally synthesized  <dig> nt half hairpin microarray probes, containing  <dig> nt from the common vector context. we found an approximate 2-fold median array signal intensity increase from  <dig> nt half hairpin probe sequences as compared to  <dig> nt probes. hence we included only  <dig> nt half hairpin probes into further analysis.

rows show the dilution factors of each of the seven shrna expression construct subpools in each of the four template pools used for pcr amplification via half hairpin primers or barcode primers respectively. subpool- <dig> consists of  <dig> different pgipz plasmids; while subpools- <dig> to - <dig> consist of ten different pgipz plasmids each.

histograms of signal intensities from the hybridized half hairpin as well as the barcode reference pool are shown in figure 2a and 2b. absolute signal intensities are displayed as multiples of the reference arrays background signal intensity. we found 49% of the half hairpin probes and 82% of the barcode tiling probes to have signal intensities above a threshold of 4-fold the median background intensity. for further analysis, we included only shrna expression constructs represented by more than two half hairpin probe replica or more than one barcode tiling probe above the 4-fold threshold in the reference array. under these conditions we found that 44% of the constructs could be detected via half hairpin probes whereas 92% were detectable by means of barcode tiling probes.

in order to determine the abundance of expression constructs in test pools  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> we normalized signal intensities from each of the three test arrays to the corresponding signal intensities from the reference array. the calculated  signal intensity ratios hence represent a measure for the relative abundance of every shrna expression construct in each test pool. in a second step, all signal intensity ratios were normalized to the ratios obtained from the equimolar subpool- <dig> of each array and averaged for every dilution factor. figures 2c and 2d summarize ratios from all three test pools analyzed via half hairpin or barcode tiling probes respectively. table  <dig> further gives an overview of mean ratios together with the corresponding standard deviation, p-value and number of analyzable shrna expression constructs for every dilution step.

shown are the normalized  mean ratios together with the corresponding standard deviations , p-values and numbers of analyzable shrna expression constructs  for each dilution factor. the p-values reflect significance of the differences between mean ratios obtained from the undiluted subpool- <dig> and the indicated dilution factors. for n <  <dig>  no standard deviation or p-value could be determined.

negative selection screen
in order to assess the performance of barcode tiling arrays in negative selection screens, we established a screening system to detect essential genes in the breast carcinoma cell line mda-mb- <dig>  for that purpose, lentiviruses carrying each of the  <dig> different shrna expression constructs, targeting  <dig> individual antiapoptotic genes , were pooled. this lentiviral mix was used to infect mda-mb- <dig> breast carcinoma cells at a low multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> , while selecting for puromycin. the low moi ensured most cells would carry a maximum of one knock-down construct targeting a single gene. after five days of puromycin selection, total high molecular weight  dna was extracted and served as a reference pool . another cell fraction was cultured for an additional four weeks and then subjected to hmw dna extraction, representing the test pool . the barcode sequences from tzero and tend of the pooled screen were recovered by means of pcr on hmw genomic dna, labeled and hybridized to two individual barcode tiling arrays. to account for differences in viral titers as well as in pcr amplification and hybridization efficiencies of individual probe sequences, all probe signal intensities from the test pool  were normalized to the reference pool from time point zero  by calculating the  ratio. lower titers of individual viruses in the viral pool for example would result in lower tzero as well as tend signal intensities. if the titer of a particular virus at time point zero was too low, the corresponding tzero tiling probe signals would not exceed the selected threshold and hence these shrna expression constructs would be excluded from further analysis. by applying a threshold of 10-fold the median background intensity for probe signals in the tzero reference array we avoided the described problems. additionally, a high threshold is important for the tzero reference pool in order to provide the dynamic range necessary to quantify the abundance of shrna expression constructs in the test pool tend.

correspondence analysis of the negative selection screens
associations between tiling probes and barcode sequences were analyzed by means of correspondence analysis. correspondence analysis aims to separate dissimilar objects, in our case tiling probe sequences as well as barcode sequences, from one another  <cit> . thus, similar objects are clustered together resulting in small distances, whereas dissimilar objects are located further apart. a projection of this analysis is shown in figure 3a where time point zero signal intensities from all  <dig> barcodes were used to determine the association between each of the six different tiling probes representing every barcode, marked as colored squares. expectedly, contiguous tiling probes, sharing the highest similarity with one another, are located closer to each other than tiling probes sharing no sequence similarity.

in a second step, all barcodes, represented as black dots, were spaced in the projection according to their association with each of their six tiling probes. strongest signal intensity from one particular tiling probe as compared to the remaining five means strongest association of the barcode with this tiling probe. for positive associations of a barcode with a particular tiling probe, both objects are located in the same direction from the centroid. the larger the distance from the centroid, the stronger the associations between the barcode and the given tiling probe. for negative associations, each of the two objects lies on opposite sides of the centroid. this means, barcodes are spaced in the projection according to their signal intensity profiles at time point zero. an example of strong association is given by the barcode sequences from constructs birc5-a and hspa8-b, highlighted in the projection. both barcodes show a positive association with tiling probe two and, at the same time, a negative association with tiling probes four, five and six. in other words, tzero signal intensities detected from tiling probe two were much stronger for both barcodes than signal intensities detected from tiling probes four, five and six. interestingly, no general preference for any of the tiling probes was detected, as represented by the equal distribution of all vector profiles in the projection.

identification of candidate essential genes
the depletion of a certain barcode over the time of the screen is expected to result in a decreased  ratio and thus indicate that the associated shrna targeted a gene which was essential for the proliferation of the cell line mda-mb- <dig>  therefore, log <dig> signal intensity ratios  were calculated from all signals that passed the described tzero filter criteria and averaged for each tiling probe sequence individually. in total, three independent replicate microarray experiments were carried out, resulting in a maximum of nine signal intensity ratios for each tiling probe. tiling probes represented by less than four out of the possible nine replicate signal ratios were discarded. a summary of all determined log <dig> ratios is shown in additional file  <dig> and raw microarray data is accessible through arrayexpress . figure 3b further gives an overview of the fractions of barcodes that were detectable by the indicated number of tiling probes. expression constructs represented by at least two barcode tiling probes were considered for further analysis. altogether, out of  <dig> shrna expression constructs included in the pool,  <dig>  could be analyzed by means of the described criteria.

a heat map of all log <dig> ratios from additional file  <dig> is shown in figure 3c. lines represent the  <dig> shrnas sorted by the mean value of their corresponding log <dig> ratios from tiling probes retained after filtering. table  <dig> further shows the correlation coefficients  between different tiling probes. as expected, correlation between log <dig> ratios from contiguous tiling probes is highest  since they share the highest sequence similarity. with a decrease in sequence similarity, correlation also decreases. thus, tiling probes sharing no common sequence display the lowest correlation . a ranking of the mean log <dig> ratios, representing the abundance of each shrna in the pool after four weeks of screening, is shown in figure 4a. those log <dig> ratios were then plotted against their significance. the volcano plot in figure 4b gives an overview of the results from our pooled screen. it shows the distribution of log <dig> ratios determined for each shrna, relative to their calculated p-values. we found that  <dig> candidate constructs showed negative log <dig> ratios together with a p-value <  <dig> , indicating their depletion from the pool.

correlation coefficients  between log <dig> ratios from all analyzed tiling probes  are shown.

the mean r² values from all tiling probes sharing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> nt or no sequence similarity is shown. correlation is strongest between probes with a sequence overlap of  <dig> nt and decreases with reduced sequence similarity.

validation of candidate essential genes
to verify the potential anti-proliferative effects of candidates identified through the analysis of the pooled rnai screen, we selected eleven shrna expression constructs for closer analysis in an arrayed 96-well format. first of all, two shrna expression constructs, termed brca1-a and brca1-b, both encoding identical shrna sequences targeting the expression of brca <dig>  but associated with two different  <dig> nt barcode sequences were selected for validation. the log <dig> ratios from both constructs indicated a significant anti-proliferative effect . we transduced the constructs individually into the host cell line and examined their potential to reduce target mrna abundance, inhibit cell viability and induce apoptosis. for brca1-a as well as for brca1-b we detected close to equal reduction of brca <dig> expression, a concomitant decrease in cell viability and induction of caspases 3/ <dig>  a hallmark of apoptosis .

in much the same way as for brca <dig>  further constructs targeting expression of the genes birc <dig> , nup <dig>  and hspa <dig>  were analyzed. for each of the three genes we identified at least one construct with a significant log <dig> ratio below - <dig>  and one construct showing a ratio greater than - <dig> . expression levels were reduced below  <dig> -fold that of the non-silencing control  by at least one construct targeting each of the three mentioned genes. cells with efficient reduction of birc <dig> and nup <dig> expression were strongly impaired in their viability when assayed eight days post-infection . in the case of hspa <dig>  a reduction of mrna expression to  <dig> -fold that of the nsc caused only a mild reduction in cell viability . moreover, transduction of birc5-a-c as well as nup62-a-b induced caspases 3/ <dig> unlike any of the hspa <dig> targeting constructs .

the weak inhibition of viability after reduction of hspa <dig> expression was unexpected considering the log <dig> ratios from hspa8-a  and hspa8-b . a major discrepancy between both assays, however, is their duration. while the pooled screens were carried out over a period of four weeks, validation assays were performed eight days post infection. to test for the possibility of hspa <dig> knock-down impairing viability later than eight days post infection, we decided to perform another viability assay for the constructs hspa8-a-c at sixteen days post infection. as shown in figure 5b, inhibition of viability was detected for hspa8-a as well as for hspa8-b, resembling the  ratios determined from the pooled screen.

discussion
technical considerations
in this manuscript we demonstrate how our barcode tiling approach facilitates highly reproducible and quantitative analysis of pooled rnai screens. as compared to previous approaches employing a single half-hairpin or full length barcode probe  <cit> , we used six non-identical tiling probe sequences to measure the abundance of shrna expression constructs from three test pools of pgipz plasmids with engineered concentrations. we directly compared our approach to the analysis of the same pools via half hairpin probe sequences. when we apply a threshold of 4-fold the median background intensity to the reference array from the half hairpin as well as the barcode tiling probes, we retain 49% of the half hairpin probes and as many as 82% of the barcode tiling probes. these values are similar to the findings from silva et al. who determined 60% of the half hairpin and 80% of the full barcode sequences to exceed 4-fold background intensity  <cit> . one possible reason for the reduced fraction of half hairpin as compared to barcode reference signals passing the threshold is the pcr reaction used to amplify the molecular tags. due to the complementary nature of shrna sequences, self-annealing could be an explanation for the reduced signal intensity. seeing as the forward primer binding site in the loop sequence of the shrna consists of only  <dig> nucleotides, a rather low annealing temperature of 50°c had to be used. the stem of the shrna, however, is  <dig> nt long. hence, a sequence dependent, selective self-annealing of specific shrnas could result in inefficient pcr amplification of those half hairpin sequences from a pool. as a consequence, the probe signal in the reference pool will decrease below the 4-fold threshold and be excluded from further analysis. given that no such self-complementary sequences are found in the barcodes, a more equal amplification of individual sequences from a pool is likely.

further advantages arise from the size of the  <dig> nucleotide long barcode sequence. tiling the sequence into six  <dig> nt long probes allows the omission of regions in the barcode with unfavorable hybridization properties. seeing as six dissimilar tiling probes represent each barcode, identical signal intensities from all six tiling probes would be expected, if hybridization properties between them were equal. as illustrated by the distribution of vector profiles in figure 3a, signal intensities obtained from the six different tiling probes representing every barcode vary dramatically, indicating very different hybridization properties of different tiling probes. applying a high 10-fold background threshold to the tzero reference pool excluded tiling probes with weak signal intensities from further analysis. as summarized in figure 3b, for 57% of the cases, all six barcode tiling probes passed the 10-fold background threshold. for another 34%, however, at least one tiling probe did not exceed the threshold, resulting in only two to five analyzable tiling probes per barcode. in total we could analyze 91% of shrna expression constructs using more than one tiling probe with a tzero signal above the 10-fold threshold from the negative selection screens. similarly, when applying a 4-fold background threshold to the pgipz plasmid reference pool, we detected 92% of the shrna expression constructs with more than one tiling probe. this is a substantial increase compared to the 44% of shrna expression constructs analyzable via half hairpin probe sequences.

besides an enhanced fraction of analyzable shrna expression constructs, the detection by means of barcode tiling probes also increases the statistical robustness of the analysis. seeing as the abundance of each shrna expression construct is detected by at least two, in most cases even six different tiling probes, variations resulting from probe sequence biases are minimized. this is reflected by the lower standard deviations as well as p-values when comparing barcode tiling with half hairpin probe results . additionally, the correlation coefficients presented in table  <dig> clearly point out the difference in log <dig> ratios obtained from different tiling probes of the same barcode. if probe sequence properties had no impact on the determined log <dig> ratios, the correlation coefficient should not decrease with decreased sequence similarity. however, we found correlation between log <dig> ratios from probes sharing  <dig> out of  <dig> bp nucleotide sequence similarity to be r² =  <dig> . the correlation between tiling probe sequences decreased further with reduced similarity . when detecting the abundance of shrna expression constructs via half hairpin probes on the other hand, each  ratio is determined based on one single probe sequence. consequently, the variance of mean values determined from the pgipz plasmid dilution series is generally greater, when analyzing the pools via half hairpin as compared to barcode tiling probes . incorporating signals from different tiling probes reduces sequence biases and allows more accurate detection of the abundance of individual shrna expression constructs from a pool. figure 2d further illustrates how barcode tiling analysis yields highly reproducible  ratios that allow quantification of the relative abundance of individual shrna expression constructs over a large data area, ranging from 7e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  the first test dilution factor that can be distinguished from the undiluted reference with high significance  is 7e- <dig> . any test concentration below 1e- <dig> fold the reference concentration resulted in a  ratio below  <dig> . this goes to show that barcode tiling analysis can not only quantify shrna expression construct abundance over a large data area, but also strongly reduces chances to detect false positives as well as false negatives. in comparison, half hairpin analysis allows quantification, if at all, only in a more limited data area , together with decreased reproducibility, making false positive as well as negative detection more likely .

in summary, comparing half hairpin with barcode tiling probe analysis of the same templates highlights the differences between both analysis methods. a dramatic increase in the fraction of analyzable constructs together with much more statistically robust and accurate  ratios clearly demonstrates the advantages of the barcode tiling approach over the customary half hairpin analysis.

negative selection screen
for a negative selection screen, the  <dig> pgipz plasmids were packaged into lentiviral particles and a pool of virus was used to infect the breast carcinoma cell line mda-mb- <dig>  in an initial calibration step, we discarded probe sequences displaying tzero signal intensities that were below 10-fold background, as compared to a 4-fold background used for the analysis of the engineered pgipz plasmid pools. this resulted in only nine percent of the shrna constructs from the pooled screen which did not fulfill the criteria for further analysis . similarly, analysis of the equimolar pgipz reference pool, which contained all  <dig> expression constructs, resulted in eight percent of the shrna expression constructs not fulfilling the described criteria. these finding indicate that we either had incorrect barcode sequence information , resulting in non-complementary probe sequences on the microarray, or problems with pcr amplification of the barcodes represented by the undetectable probe signals and that low titers of individual viruses in the pool were not responsible for undetectable shrna expression constructs.

from  <dig> candidate shrnas identified from the pooled negative selection screen to potentially inhibit the viability of the breast carcinoma cell line mda-mb- <dig>  a subset was selected for arrayed validation assays. we found that reduced brca <dig> expression resulted in caspase 3/ <dig> induction and decreased viability of the cells. these findings are in accord with the essential role of brca <dig> in embryonic cell proliferation  <cit> . paradoxically, under non-physiological over-expression conditions, brca <dig> induces apoptosis, and its silencing increases viability of certain cancer cells  <cit> . our findings indicate that in mda-mb- <dig>  brca <dig> inhibition might be more detrimental than in other cell lines. in this context it is also worth mentioning the potential role of the brca <dig> binding partner bard <dig> as an essential gene for mda-mb- <dig> cell growth. from our dna microarray data analysis we found the log <dig> ratio for the bard <dig> targeting construct v2lhs_ <dig> to be as low as - <dig>  . interestingly, bard <dig> has been described before as being essential for the function of brca <dig> and the survival of embryonic mice  <cit> . taken together, our data suggests an important role for functional brca <dig> pathways in mda-mb- <dig> cell viability. besides the tumor suppressor brca <dig>  we identified three more candidate genes whose expression was demonstrated to be of importance for the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line mda-mb- <dig>  among those genes was the inhibitor of apoptosis birc <dig>  the nuclear pore complex  component nup <dig> and the heat shock protein  <dig> family member hspa <dig> 

birc <dig> is known to be an inhibitor of apoptosis  that is over expressed in numerous human cancers including breast cancer  <cit> . it has been claimed that birc <dig> has the potential to be a prognostic marker in breast cancer patients  <cit> . furthermore, the inhibitory effects on the proliferation of mda-mb- <dig> after sirna mediated silencing of birc <dig> have been documented  <cit> . here we confirm that inhibition of birc <dig> expression by shrna below  <dig> -fold of its endogenous level strongly inhibits proliferation of mda-mb- <dig> cells via caspase 3/ <dig> activation. these findings provide further evidence for the potentially essential role of birc <dig> in human breast cancer.

the ubiquitously expressed nup <dig> has been described to be an essential part of the nuclear pore complex. it has been reported to be involved in cargo transport across the nuclear envelope  <cit> . importantly, recently a role for nup <dig> in cell cycle regulation has been proposed  <cit> . here we demonstrate that nup <dig> knock-down leads to induction of apoptosis, together with a decrease in viability.

finally, we identified the heat shock cognate protein hspa <dig>  to be important for the viability of mda-mb- <dig> cells. the highly conserved protein can bind to nascent polypeptides and facilitate their correct folding. it is ubiquitously expressed in the cytosol of a variety of non-tumor as well as cancerous cells including breast cancer  <cit> . it has also been described by rohde et al.  that the knock-down of hspa <dig> in hela cells generated an elongated fibroblast-like morphology before rounding up and detachment from the culture dish. in concordance with those findings we observed a very similar phenotype in mda-mb- <dig> after efficient hspa <dig> knock-down at eight days post-infection . however, viability was only slightly impaired at that time point. thus we decided to record another time point at sixteen days post-infection. indeed, we could show a much more pronounced inhibition of viability at sixteen days post infection with hspa8-a and hspa8-b , as predicted from their  signal intensity ratio. additionally, mda-mb- <dig> cells infected with hspa8-a also detached from the cell culture dish at sixteen days post infection, which is again consistent with the findings from rohde et al. .

taken together, our data illustrates how inhibiting the expression of different essential genes can influence the proliferation of mda-mb- <dig> at different immediacy. while, for example, the log <dig> ratios determined via microarray analysis of pooled screens from the constructs birc5-b , birc5-c  and hspa8-a  are almost identical, their viability at eight days post infection varies greatly . both constructs targeting birc <dig> show similar reduction of cell viability at eight days post infection , whereas the construct hspa8-a shows much weaker effects . the inhibitory effect of hspa8-a only becomes noticeable at sixteen days post infection . to further illustrate this issue, we plotted the viability data against the  ratios for the constructs we used for validation assays . while the ratio determined from the pooled screen represents a measure for proliferation over  <dig> days, the viability assay only detects effects that occur within eight days post-infection. if knock-down of hspa <dig>  birc <dig> and nup <dig> induced inhibition of proliferation with the same immediacy one would expect all data points to be on one linear regression line. however, whereas depletion of some genes takes no longer than eight days to almost completely inhibit the viability of the infected cells , some others take a longer period of time . these differences are further reflected by the striking morphological changes in cells eight days post infection with the constructs nup62-a, birc5-a and hspa8-a . introduction of nup62-a, for instance, resembles the typical apoptosis phenotype of mda-mb- <dig> leading to small round cells that finally detach from the cell culture dish. introducing birc5-a, on the other hand, results in cells much larger than the control cells which are unable to divide but do not detach from the surface until eight days post infection. hspa8-a cells, finally, seem to be only slightly impaired in their ability to divide but display the fibroblast-like morphology described for hela cells by rohde et al  before detaching from the surface at sixteen days post infection .

CONCLUSIONS
in the work presented, we demonstrate how pooled rnai screens can be quantitatively and reproducibly analyzed by means of barcode tiling arrays. we clearly show the advantages of this novel method over the commonly performed analysis via half hairpin arrays. to further exploit the full potential of barcode tiling, optimal tiling probe sequences need to be experimentally determined for each barcode present in a given shrna expression library. this calibration step would ensure a maximized fraction of analyzable expression constructs combined with a reduced sequence bias as compared to currently used approaches.

besides essential gene discovery, a variety of additional exciting applications for pooled rnai screens become conceivable with the help of increased sensitivity obtained from barcode tiling analysis. one intriguing idea, for example, are pooled synthetic lethality screens  <cit>  allowing the identification of cancer specific molecular targets. such screens require accurate methods for the detection of particular shrna abundance. our work provides the methodological scaffolding to allow the analysis of such technically challenging experiments.
