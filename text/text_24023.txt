BACKGROUND
marek's disease virus  is an oncogenic poultry herpesvirus of considerable economic importance to the poultry industry. virus strains have become increasingly virulent since the 1960s  <cit> . the causes of this viral evolution are unclear  <cit> . quantification of patterns of viral shedding and virus-induced host mortality are necessary for a rigorous understanding of the epidemiology of a disease, not least to identify increases in virulence. here we develop methods to do this.

mdv is an airborne pathogen with infection occurring via inhalation  <cit> . virus shedding occurs by infected feather follicle epithelium  <cit> . the resulting dust and dander from dead stratified cells and moulted feathers can then remain in the environment and act as a reservoir for chicken infection. clinical signs are varied and result in significant morbidity and mortality depending on host genetic susceptibility and virulence of the mdv strain  <cit> . symptoms include polyneuritis , visceral lymphoma , acute transient paralysis, immunosuppression, brain oedema and acute rash. there has been a change in the types of clinical signs since the disease was first noted  <cit> , when chronic polyneuritis was the only sign. since then, the list of clinical signs described above expanded gradually over the decades  <cit> .

almost all industrialised countries have experienced md losses in their poultry industry and a crude estimate of the cost of marek's disease is said to be in the range of us $1- <dig> billion annually  <cit> . control of marek's disease is predominantly via vaccination of chickens. crucially the mdv vaccine was the first vaccine to be developed against any cancer  <cit> . three types of vaccine have been developed for use against md. these are herpesvirus of turkeys , non-pathogenic serotype  <dig> mdv and non-pathogenic serotype  <dig>  <cit> . these vaccines have been used in different sequences in different countries and the vaccine types have also been commonly combined in bivalent or trivalent vaccines.

definitions of virulence are numerous and varied  <cit> . microbiologists equate virulence with the notions of both infectivity and severity of disease, whereas evolutionary biologists focus on evolutionary fitness of either the pathogen or the host  <cit> . zoologists tend to focus on host fitness  <cit>  with most mathematical models describing this specifically as host mortality  <cit> .

there have been various attempts to define virulence in the context of mdv  <cit> . for example, witter  <cit>  relates the percentage of hvt or bivalent  vaccinated chickens, that when infected with a particular strain develop gross lesions or die of marek's disease within eight weeks to the figure in unvaccinated chickens challenged with the same strain. this percentage score uses the protective effect of vaccines as its metric for virulence. in addition,  <cit>  use neurovirulence as a tool for pathotyping mdv strains, noting that many of the very virulent strains are synonymous with high levels of neuropathology. this method circumvents the need for both vaccine-based definitions and therefore high numbers of birds, and also may cut the experiment time. in the first pathotyping regime, there are four recognised mdv serotype  <dig> pathotypes, each occupying part of the 'continuum of virulence'  <cit>  defined as: mild, m; virulent, v; very virulent, vv; very virulent plus, vv+. this grouping correlates very well with the second pathotyping regime  <cit> .

control strategies for mdv require an understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, in particular how virulence relates to key parameters such as viral shedding rates and duration of infectious period. there have been efforts to find correlates with virulence of mdv isolates, most notably with viral load . this has been achieved by cell culture techniques  <cit>  and intra-cellular detection during the first  <dig> days of infection  <cit> . however, the relationship between viral load  and virulence has not been convincingly tested  <cit> . pcr testing methods have been developed in order to quantify viral loads  <cit> , which have enabled the viral loads in shed dust to be directly measured  <cit> . the infectious period is defined as the total time in which an infected bird sheds virus  <cit> . this is determined by the clearance rate and the lifespan of the individual host. since there is no recovery from mdv infection, the infectious period is defined by a total of four parameters: the disease-induced mortality, the latent period  and two other non-disease associated parameters, namely non-disease induced mortality and the maximum lifespan of an individual .

here we present methods for parameter estimation for mdv isolates, allowing a formal quantification of infected host lifespan, viral shedding rates and viral latent periods. the parameters determined from the analysis allow comparison between isolates of different virulence in both unvaccinated and vaccinated birds. it is anticipated that the parameter estimates will be used for a better understanding of the pathology and aetiology of the disease itself and as a platform for investigation into the causes of virulence evolution.

RESULTS
in the first section, we used survival analysis with a weibull mortality function to build a statistical model for the lifespan of birds infected with mdv. in the second section, we developed a dynamic model to simulate the shedding of virus by a group of birds and used bayesian techniques to estimate the four key infectiousness parameters: primary and secondary latent periods and viral shedding rates.

mortality
an additive covariate weibull regression model was fitted to the bird survival data, since the interaction terms were not significant. the model estimates are given in table  <dig>  the weibull model captures the data significantly better with the covariates used than without . the resulting graphs showing the data and weibull model fit are displayed in figure  <dig>  the model showed that host lifespan decreased with virulence score and increased with vaccination , although there was no significant difference between the effect of the two vaccines on lifespan . on most days there were either zero or one birds dying from mdv-related illness from the initial  <dig> or  <dig> individual birds in each group . these data and further information are published in separate experimental work  <cit> .

the transformed virulence score is a continuous covariate and the vaccine treatment is a categorical covariate in an additive regression, giving the test statistic, z and the corresponding p value. the numbers in brackets are the 95% credible intervals.

shedding
the dynamic model output records the density of virus /mg dust), which fitted to the data from each isolator independently. the model fits can be compared directly in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which give the day of sampling and the sample value. these data and further information are published in a separate experimental paper  <cit> .

for each isolator, the median of the posterior distribution for the four parameters in the model  are given in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  where the number of air changes per hour, α, is set to  <dig>  assuming α ∈  <cit> , the results obtained in the mcmc method did not change, whatever value of α is chosen.

a linear model was fitted to account for the variation in the primary and secondary latent periods, with the latent period as the response variable and arcsine square-root transformed virulence score and vaccine treatment as multiplicative covariates. for the primary latent period, none of the results were significant , showing that the primary latent period did not differ among virus strains and nor was it altered by vaccine treatment. for the secondary latent period, neither virulence score nor hvt vaccine affected the duration of the latent period, however, bivalent vaccine increased the duration of the second latent period significantly and to a greater extent for smaller virulence scores .

adjusted r <dig> =  <dig> , p =  <dig> .

an association between the virulence score and the estimated viral shedding rates was found. a linear regression was used to estimate the viral shedding rate as a function of arcsine square-root transformed virulence score and vaccine treatment. there was no significant association between the primary viral shedding rate and hvt or bivalent vaccine treatment  nor virulence score . there was, however, a strong positive association between the virulence score of a strain and the secondary viral shedding rate . there was no association between the secondary viral shedding rate and either hvt or bivalent vaccine treatment . figure  <dig> shows the estimated secondary viral shedding rate as a function of virulence score for different vaccine treatments.

adjusted r <dig> =  <dig> , p <  <dig> .

discussion
the survival model fits the nine survival curves well on the whole, with both replicates combined into one fit. the delay which characterises the mortality profile for marek's disease is captured well by the weibull model. in most cases, the viral shedding model captures the data well.

the viral shedding model assumes that all birds become initially infected with mdv. while it is difficult to model individual birds based on the resolution of the data available, we do point out that the assumption that all birds become infected precipitates the estimated per bird viral shedding rates being perhaps an over-estimate of the actual rates. on the other hand, the qpcr methods used estimate total viral copies which is not necessarily equivalent to total infectious material and therefore serves as an upper limit of viable infectious dna.

our estimate of the primary latent period of between  <dig> and  <dig> days is much shorter than earlier estimates of around  <dig> days  <cit>  but only slightly shorter than more recent estimates based on new pcr techniques which have detected significant quantities of virus in feather tips  <cit>  and feather dander  <cit>  at  <dig> days post infection. this discrepancy may be due to a number of factors: detectability of virus at low quantities, the sampling time of the experiments and heterogeneities between the experiments. the estimates here also have confidence intervals between 0- <dig> days which suggest the data are not able to give a great deal of certainty on the exact time of onset of viral shedding. further analysis might take into account biological knowledge through prior distributions to get a more exact value, and past experimental studies would suggest shedding begins towards the end of the estimated interval  <cit> .

the pathotyping of mdv isolates, similar to that pioneered by witter and colleagues  <cit> , is a useful tool for comparing the pathogenicity of strains with respect to others in vaccinated birds. however several of the more recent isolated, highly virulent strains have ranks above  <dig>  in some cases  <dig> on witter's ranking system. should more virulent strains emerge, it will be difficult to categorise them via this method, as the scale is truncated at  <dig>  the method of fitting a weibull distribution proposed in this paper allows for a greater flexibility of pathotyping, in that an isolate may be categorised according to its mean time to kill the host. the subsequent effect of vaccination of the host on this metric can then be established.

biologically, it may seem more sustainable to pathotype according to the lifespan of an unvaccinated bird, but experimentally it may also be a solution to the costly procedure of having two or three groups of birds, each vaccinated with a different treatment. even a simple 'time to death' metric can be performed in relatively few birds, as was the case for the myxoma virus in rabbits in australia. myxoma strains were pathotyped effectively when the case fatality rate proved experimentally intensive and ineffective in discriminating between similarly virulent strains  <cit>  noted this restriction of current pathotyping regimes, instead favouring a system based on neuropathology to circumvent these methodological and experimental limitations. the analysis presented here differs from both of these past approaches due to its epidemiological focus on virulence. however, we point out that the methodology adopted here only analyses three distinct strains. therefore, a wider range of strain virulences and places of origin will be required to sufficiently extrapolate the current results to the whole virulence spectrum.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper uses a mathematical approach to estimate key epidemiological parameters for marek's disease virus . we used survival analysis with a weibull mortality function to build a statistical model for the lifespan of birds infected with mdv. we were able to compare the relative impact of virulence score and vaccine covariates by calculating credible intervals via bayesian methods. we developed a dynamic model to simulate the shedding of virus by a group of birds and used bayesian techniques to estimate the four key infectiousness parameters: primary and secondary latent periods and viral shedding rates.

we applied these methods to the data for three mdv strains varying moderately in virulence. from the survival analysis, we found that increasing the virulence score of a virus strain decreases the lifespan of the host . vaccinating the host with either the first or second generation vaccine increases its lifespan, but neither one to any greater degree . from the viral shedding analysis, we concluded primary latent period is not affected by vaccination or virulence score, however, secondary latent period increases with bivalent vaccine treatment . secondary  viral shedding rate  is higher for strains of higher virulence . vaccination does not reduce long term viral shedding rate significantly. together, these results imply that more virulent viruses shed more infectious material into the environment and bivalent vaccines reduce the infectious period, especially for less virulent strain infections.

the results described here are qualitatively in line with current thinking on mdv pathogenesis, but the new methods presented allow a formal comparison of strains in an epidemiological meaningful way. it is anticipated that this analysis will allow a more quantitative understanding of the aetiology of mdv and the mechanisms governing a functional rise in virulence for a strain. with this analysis it is hoped that a more epidemiologically significant classification of mdv strains will emerge which will eventually provide not only insight into the reasons for evolution to highly virulent strains but also a metric to evaluate future risks and the efficacy of possible control strategies.
