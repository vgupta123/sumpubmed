BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries, and is considered a serious public health problem worldwide, killing almost  <dig> million people every year  <cit> . according to the who, one-third of the world's population is infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis . the incidence of new cases of tb has increased mainly due to the impact of the hiv epidemic  <cit>  and the emergence of resistance to anti-tb drugs  <cit> . the currently available vaccine, mycobacterium bovis bacillus calmette-guérin , is one of the oldest and most commonly administered vaccines worldwide  <cit> . it was obtained in the early 1920's by albert calmette and camille guérin at the pasteur institute, lille, france, after  <dig> serial passages of a clinical isolate of m. bovis in glycerinated medium containing ox bile  <cit> . attenuation during in vitro passages is believed to have resulted from the loss and/or reorganization of genomic regions, some of which have been recently identified  <cit> . m. bovis bcg moreau is the strain used in brazil for vaccine production since the 1930's  <cit> . according to recent molecular studies  <cit> , it is considered an "old" strain, more similar to the original bcg derived by calmette and guérin. vaccination with bcg has many advantages, yielding efficient protection against severe childhood forms of tb, and also against leprosy  <cit> . in addition, it is recognized as a safe and inexpensive vaccine that can be administered shortly after birth  <cit> . on the other hand, it shows variable protection against the most common form of the disease, pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, and it does not prevent the establishment of latent tb. it has been reported that different m. bovis bcg strains, including bcg moreau, induce varying levels of protection against m. tuberculosis infection in animal models  <cit> . comparative genetic analysis of bcg strains has revealed that each vaccine currently in use is unique  <cit> , and providing several clues for the failure of bcg as an effective vaccine. proteomic studies have shown that bcg strains with similar genomic content, such as bcg denmark and phipps, exhibit phenotypic differences that can be particularly important for pathogenesis, immune response and variable efficacy of bcg vaccine  <cit> . other factors have also been implicated in its unpredictable efficacy:  the genetic variability amongst vaccinated individuals;  cross-reactivity of the immune response to bcg due to environmental mycobacteria  <cit> ;  differences in vaccine production procedures, variable doses, and bacterial viability, amongst others  <cit> . new vaccination strategies are therefore urgently needed, particularly against pulmonary forms of tb.

the modulation of cellular functions of the host cell is a dynamic process that requires viable mycobacteria, supporting the idea that the components actively secreted by the living bacteria are the main players involved in this process  <cit> . membrane and membrane associated proteins also play an important role in this process  <cit> . subunit vaccines based on mixtures of culture filtrate proteins have resulted in protective immunity in animal models of tb  <cit> . these molecules are also strongly recognized during mtb infection in various animal models, as well as in early stages of pulmonary tb in humans  <cit> . culture filtrate is therefore an attractive source of potential candidate antigens for the development of new vaccines and diagnostic reagents. in this report, we have employed a combination of 2de and mass spectrometry analysis in order to generate a proteomic map of cfps from the brazilian m. bovis bcg moreau strain, comparing it to the reference strain, m. bovis bcg pasteur. the data presented may contribute to the identification of useful markers for quality control of the bcg moreau vaccine production, and yield possible clues regarding the variable effectiveness of these vaccine strains.

RESULTS
protein separation, identification and sub-cellular localization
the bcg strains were grown in static cultures, as surface pellicles, for  <dig> days, with no apparent difference in growth. the genetic profile of the  <dig> strains was confirmed by pcr , corroborating with previous reports  <cit>  the preliminary separation of bcg moreau cfps by 2de revealed that most protein spots clustered in the ph range 3- <dig> . to generate proteomic maps, samples were therefore applied to immobilized ph gradient  strips in the ph intervals 3- <dig>  and 5- <dig>  and subsequently separated in the second dimension across 12%  and 15% sds-page . to aid in visualization, gel images were merged to produce an artificial map representative of the ph range 3- <dig>  comprising all the  <dig> spots resolved in the individual gels. these spots were excised and digested with trypsin. the resulting peptides were submitted to mass spectrometry analysis leading to the putative identification of  <dig> protein spots corresponding to  <dig> different proteins . for clarity, we have adopted the standard protein nomenclature used for m. tuberculosis strain h37rv  and m. bovis bcg pasteur 1173p <dig> . identified proteins showed a pi variation between 3- <dig> and a molecular mass  range between  <dig> and  <dig> kda. the comparison of experimentally determined and theoretical mr and pi values of the identified protein spots from bcg moreau against the predicted values for m. tuberculosis strain h37rv proteins, obtained from the search with mascot version  <dig> , showed a positive correlation according to the spearman coefficient  considering the fact that the proteins identified in this study were obtained from the culture filtrate, we analyzed the presence of possible signals that could direct these proteins to the extracellular fraction , using signal p , lipop , tatp  and secretomep . of the  <dig> proteins,  <dig>  have no extracellular prediction. however, when we compare our data to  <dig> previous reports on the culture filtrate proteome of m. tuberculosis h37rv - the 2de database at the max planck institute  and a recent work by de souza and collaborators  <cit>  -  <dig> proteins  have been previously reported in one or both studies, including  <dig> of the proteins with no extracellular prediction. we also evaluated the number of potential transmembrane  domains using tmhmm . thirteen proteins were found to contain  <dig> predicted tm domain which, although coinciding in all cases with the signal peptide region predicted by signalp, does not exclude a possible membrane localization for some of these proteins  <cit> . for the  <dig> proteins with a predicted signal peptide, the theoretical pi and mr were calculated for the full protein and for the mature protein, after removal of the signal peptide region predicted by signalp .

predicted biological functions for the identified proteins
the assignment of the identified cfps into functional categories was based on the functional classification tree from bcglist . the  <dig> proteins identified by ms/ms are distributed across  <dig> of those functional groups . the largest groups were "intermediary metabolism and respiration" , "cell wall and cell processes"  and "conserved hypotheticals" .

differential cfp proteomic profiles between m. bovis bcg strains moreau and pasteur
the 2de profiles from m. bovis bcg strains moreau and pasteur were compared to identify differences that could provide relevant information about the brazilian vaccine strain. for quantification analyses of the protein spots derived from both strains, the pdquest software was used, comparing the optical densities of the matched spots in 2de gel images. the experiments were repeated at least  <dig> times, and only the differences confirmed in all comparisons were accepted as strain specific. as expected, the proteomic profiles of cfps from bcg strains moreau and pasteur were very similar ; however, some variations in relative protein quantifications were observed. a total of  <dig> proteins represented by  <dig> spots showed a differential expression pattern between the two bcg strains . in addition,  <dig> proteins were found exclusively in bcg moreau and one protein exclusively in bcg pasteur .

quantitative analysis revealed that  <dig> proteins were present in at least 2-fold higher concentration in bcg moreau when compared to bcg pasteur : the apa glycoprotein ; the immunogenic protein mpb <dig> ; the secreted antigen 85b ; and proteins mpb <dig> and mpb <dig>  . spot  <dig> was also identified as mpb <dig> but was observed only in bcg moreau .

four proteins were more expressed in bcg pasteur when compared to moreau : the heat shock proteins hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> ; the presumed trigger factor  and the probable iron-regulated peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase a  .

as expected, mpb <dig>  and cfp <dig>  were identified in bcg moreau but were not present in bcg pasteur  due to the loss of genomic region rd <dig> in the more recent bcg strains  <cit> . on the other hand, bcg moreau contains a genomic deletion  encompassing genes rv3400-rv3405c . in this study we identified only one protein present in bcg pasteur and absent in bcg moreau: a probable hydrolase encoded by rv <dig>  . this difference is consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

discussion
the main goal of this study was to perform a comprehensive proteomic analysis of cfps from m. bovis bcg strains moreau and pasteur by combining 2de and mass spectrometry, allowing for the evaluation of phenotypic differences between the two strains. the 2de patterns were highly similar, presenting numerous prominent common spots that could be used as landmarks. from 2de gels of cfp preparations from m. bovis bcg moreau,  <dig> spots were identified. the mr and pi values estimated by 2de showed a good correlation with expected values; however 34% of the identified proteins were detected in  <dig> or more spots with different mr and/or pi. this is probably due to post-translational modifications  such as glycosylation, phosphorylation or other modifications already described for several of the identified proteins  <cit> . for example, rv <dig>  and rv0020c  possess fha domains that bind phosphothreonine  <cit> , and rv <dig>  is also described as being phosphorylated in the same amino acid residues  <cit> .

protein modifications in prokaryotes are of great biological interest but are not yet well understood. in this work we observed several deaminated proteins , possibly associated with important biological processes such as protein turnover, molecular aging and cell adhesion  <cit> . in addition, deamination may be useful for the refinement of protein searches by ms/ms as well as tryptophan oxidation and n-terminal pyroglutamylation  <cit> , which are also observed in several peptides identified in this study . interestingly, formylation was only observed for one n-terminal methionine residue in rv <dig> , a fha domain-containing protein that constitutes the major substrate for an essential kinase, pknb, in mtb cell extracts  <cit> . formylated peptides and proteins are specific signatures of bacterial metabolism, and attractive targets to the innate immune system, serving as potent chemoattractants for mammalian phagocytic leukocytes  <cit> . the lack of other proteins showing this particular ptm could also indicate that peptide deformylases are operating with high efficiency. another chemical modification observed was threonine acetylation. although n-terminal acetylation is common in eukaryotic proteins, it has been reported to be rare in prokaryotes  <cit> . this ptm is present in  <dig> proteins identified as putative esat- <dig> like proteins, esxi  and esxn  . the n-terminal acetylation may not always alter function, but in mtb it has been shown that antigen esat- <dig>  which normally interacts with the protein cfp- <dig>  fails to do so when acetylated  <cit> , possibly hindering its secretion via the mycobacterial-specific type vii secretion system  <cit> .

in the current study, only  <dig>  of the identified proteins were found to have a predicted signal peptide. of these,  <dig> have one predicted tm segment coinciding with the predicted signal peptide region. since current methods are not fully efficient in predicting membrane retention of proteins with typical sec-type signal peptides  <cit> , we cannot discard the possibility that the extracellular localization of some of these proteins may result from the gradual proteolytic release of membrane proteins containing a single amino-terminal membrane anchor.

several mycobacterial proteins that do not present a canonical signal peptide can be secreted by alternative secretion mechanisms, such as the twin-arginine translocation system, the alternative seca <dig> pathway or the recently described type vii  secretion system  <cit> . other studies on the culture filtrate proteome of mycobacteria have also reported the presence of numerous leaderless proteins  <cit> . some of the proteins identified by us are also reported in the membrane proteome of bcg moreau  <cit>  and the cell wall proteome of m. smegmatis  <cit> . the abundance in the culture filtrate of m. bovis bcg moreau of proteins without signal peptide prediction may also result from bacterial lysis, in combination with high levels of protein expression and extracellular stability, as described for several mtb proteins  <cit> . nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which these proteins are exported is still unknown.

approximately 24% of the cfps identified in the present study have no defined function ; among these we can highlight the conserved hypothetical proteins tb <dig>  , tb <dig>  , rv2626c  and tb <dig>   this last, recently described as being differentially expressed in the secretome of a recombinant bcg strain  <cit> . although their functions have not been established, these proteins have been considered as antigens, able to distinguish between tuberculosis clinical states, or attractive targets for the development of new drugs, vaccines and diagnostic strategies for tb  <cit> .

several other mycobacterial antigens, previously described as important for vaccine development and tb diagnosis, have also been identified in the present study, including the esat- <dig> like protein esxg , recognized by multiple t-cell lines and able to boost ifn-γ levels in mouse and guinea pig models of tb  <cit> , and the secreted mpt <dig> protein , described as being able to induce higher levels of antigen-specific cd8+ t-cell responses  <cit> .

proteins involved in biosynthesis and degradation of fatty acids were also identified, such as the members of the antigen- <dig> complex, fbpa , fbpb , fbpc  and fbpd , essential for the biosynthesis of mycolic acids  <cit> . in this work, ag85b  was found to be more abundant in the culture filtrate of bcg moreau than in that of bcg pasteur. the protein has been shown to induce partial protection against tb in animal models, and is considered an important immunodominant antigen and a promising vaccine candidate  <cit> . mpt <dig>  and cfp <dig>  were found only in bcg moreau; both are described in the literature as immunogenic antigens and potential targets for the development of new vaccines against tb  <cit> . the genes encoding these proteins are located in rd <dig>  a genomic region deleted in a number of more recent bcg strains, including m. bovis bcg pasteur, but present in bcg moreau  <cit> .

the low levels of mpb <dig> and mpb <dig> in m. bovis bcg pasteur were also confirmed in our study. their reduced expression is due to a point mutation in the translational start codon of the sigk gene  <cit> , observed in many bcg strains, but absent in bcg moreau. immunologic studies have shown that both proteins induce cellular and humoral immune responses in experimental models of infection and in natural infection in humans  <cit> . mpb <dig> is a protein only found in species within the mtb complex  <cit> , shown to be immunodominant both in humans and animal models  <cit>  and a promising candidate for serodiagnosis of active tb as well as for vaccine development. mpb <dig> was identified in four different spots ,  <dig> of which  showed statistically significant differences in expression, with an increase of more than 3-fold in bcg moreau as compared to bcg pasteur . these  <dig> protein spots are likely to represent isoforms, probably differing due to the presence of ptms, known to cause changes in pi resulting in slightly different migration. moreover, mpb <dig> contains an n-terminal signal sequence as predicted by the signalp software, which was experimentally verified  <cit> .

the alanine-proline rich protein  is known to present a high content of proline and carbohydrate groups  <cit>  that interferes with its migratory behavior in sds-page. although we have not identified modifications such as glycosylation, this protein displays a characteristic four-spot pattern  on 2de  <cit>  . the isoforms of lowest molecular mass  showed a statistically significant 3-fold increase in expression in bcg moreau . this protein seems to be restricted to the mtb complex and has been shown to be a target for immune recognition in animals immunized with live bcg  <cit> . in addition to its high immunogenicity, it has also been described as a potential adhesin involved in the colonization of target cells  <cit> . its higher expression could contribute to an increase in the immunogenicity of bcg moreau.

four proteins were found to be at least 2-fold more expressed in bcg pasteur compared to moreau: a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase , the trigger factor , hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> , all described as participating in protein folding and response to stress, among other functions. the gene ppia is located in the pasteur-specific du <dig> duplicated region. the duplication of this gene alone may be responsible for the observed increased expression of ppiasea in bcg pasteur. comparative transcriptome analysis has shown that bcg <dig>  bcg <dig>  bcg <dig> and bcg2482c are all up-regulated in bcg pasteur when compared to bcg tokyo  <cit> . considering the genealogy of bcg vaccines  <cit> , bcg moreau, tokyo and russia belong to the same group of "older" strains, closer to the original attenuated strain derived by calmette and guérin in the early 1920's, and all lack the du <dig> duplication. the genome of bcg pasteur, unlike the older strains, carries  <dig> copies of sigh, due to a second genomic duplication , and its expression is at least 2-fold higher  <cit> . sigh is an alternative extra-cytoplasmic sigma factor involved in the response to heat shock and oxidative stress, positively regulating the expression of other genes, including dnak and possibly groel <dig>  <cit> . groel <dig>  and dnak  are chaperones involved in protein-folding, and have been associated with the induction of protection against tb infection in mice by immunization with experimental dna vaccines  <cit> . recently, these mycobacterial chaperones have been described as having vital moonlighting functions when present outside the cell: groel <dig> acts as a major adhesin, mediating binding of mtb to monocytes and the soluble protein is capable of competing for this binding, reducing bacterial association to macrophages  <cit> . dnak stimulates the secretion of chemokines required for granuloma formation  <cit>  and its overexpression was found to favor the host over the pathogen during chronic mtb infection  <cit> . all in all, subtle variations in the balance of expression and/or localization of these proteins may have profound impacts on the interaction between the bacteria  and the host's immune system, impacting vaccine efficacy.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings reported here provide new information about the proteomic characteristics of the bcg moreau vaccine strain and contribute to shed more light on the differentiated immune response and the variable effectiveness of the different bcg vaccines. in brazil, approximately  <dig>  new cases of tb are reported annually by the health system  <cit> . the bcg moreau vaccine has been used since  <dig>  and its production by fundação ataulpho de paiva  currently represents 5% of the bcg vaccine production in the world  <cit> . according to recent data from the who, global bcg immunization increased since the 1980's and brazil, with a population close to  <dig> million, shows over 99% coverage for bcg vaccination  <cit> . despite the genetic differences accumulated in bcg strains, the originally described protective efficacy of bcg moreau was not reduced, and the brazilian strain is regarded as one of the most immunogenic among the vaccine preparations that are currently available  <cit> . the exploration of the secreted sub-proteome of m. bovis bcg moreau provides valuable information regarding specific proteins, many of which have been implicated in protective immune responses, and helps defining candidates for future vaccination strategies.
