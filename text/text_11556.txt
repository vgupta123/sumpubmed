BACKGROUND
mirnas play an essential role in inner ear development  <cit> . mirnas are small non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. by binding to sequences in the 3’ untranslated region  of mrnas, a mirna can inhibit target mrnas by translational suppression and mrna destabilization  <cit> . mirnas have been implicated in hearing loss in humans, since mutations in the seed region of mir- <dig> or its gene are associated with hearing loss in three extended families  <cit> . mirnas were also reported in other human ear pathologies, including an elevation of mir- <dig> in cholesteatomas  <cit>  and in vestibular schwannomas  <cit> . mirnas were found to regulate the otitis media inflammatory response  <cit> . their study in humans, however, has been hampered by the unavailability of inner ear rna from human subjects, making the mouse an invaluable model for studying mirna development and regulation in the inner ear  <cit> . in an enu-induced mutant mouse exhibiting deafness and vestibular dysfunction, a mutation in the mir- <dig> seed region was found to be responsible for hearing loss, presumably due to the alteration in expression and hence function of both direct and indirect gene targets  <cit> . a number of mouse mutants affecting mirna regulation through dicer have been created, leading to developmental inner ear defects  <cit> . these conditional knock-out mouse mutants have been instrumental in demonstrating that mirnas are vital for inner ear morphogenesis and development of the sensory epithelia and sensory neurons.

expression of over  <dig> mirnas have been reported in mouse and rat inner ears thus far, identified by microarray analysis  <cit> , with the majority of work performed on the triad mir- <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig>  <cit> . in order to further identify and characterize mirnas in the mammalian inner ear, we used ngs for the first time to identify mirnas in cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia. using this method, we identified over  <dig> inner ear mirnas, both in common between and unique to each tissue. we further validated and characterized the expression of two mirnas, mir-6715-3p and mir-6715-5p, in the mouse inner ear. vezatin, an adherens junctions transmembrane protein previously implicated in deafness  <cit>  and arhgap <dig>  a rho gtpase activating protein  <cit> , were verified to be gene targets of mir-6715-3p. protocadherin  <dig>  a member of the δ <dig> subclass of nonclustered protocadherins and associated with epilepsy and mental retardation  <cit> , is a gene target of mir-6715-5p. arhgap <dig>  newly described in the inner ear, is expressed in the epithelial cell-cell junctions of the hair and supporting cells. the mir-6715-3p–arhgap <dig> mirna target pair defines a new regulatory pathway. understanding these interactions may shed light on known and novel mirnas, their effect on the development of normal and impaired hearing, and the mechanisms leading towards deafness.

RESULTS
rna-seq derived mirna transcription profile of the mouse inner ear sensory epithelium
in order to identify mirnas in the auditory and vestibular sensory epithelium, we sequenced short rna molecules from cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia by high–throughput rna sequencing . for the cochlea, the sensory epithelium consisted of the organ of corti, including hair cells, supporting cells, and cells of the greater and lesser epithelial ridges, as well as mesenchymal and neuronal cells. for the vestibule, the sensory epithelium was derived from the saccule, utricle and the lateral and anterior cristae and included hair cells and supporting cells. the advantage of using high–throughput sequencing is that this technique allows for assessment of transcript expression in a given sample at a large dynamic range, from minute quantities to highly abundant ones, and does not require a-priori knowledge for the identification of modified and novel rna molecules in addition to known ones. cdna libraries from small rnas were prepared from dissected sensory epithelium of post-natal day  <dig> mice. subsequent analysis of sequence reads was done using mirnakey, a tool for mirna differential expression analysis  <cit> . processed reads were aligned to the mature mus musculus mirna database , allowing one mismatch to occur between a read and the reference, due to isomirs  <cit> . sixty-six and  <dig> % of the total reads from cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia, respectively, were aligned to known mouse mirnas, indicating a successful isolation of mirnas. the majority of mapped reads in cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia,  <dig> % in the cochlea and  <dig> % in the vestibule, were uniquely mapped to a single mirna. overall,  <dig> and  <dig> known mirnas had an rpm  mapping higher than  <dig> in the cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelium, respectively . these lists include all mirnas that have been studied thus far in the mouse inner ear sensory epithelia, as well as mirnas that have not been previously detected. nine mirnas were most highly expressed in the cochlea and the vestibule, with a similar order in both, except for mir-204-5p, which was the fourth most prevalent in the cochlea and the lowest in the vestibule .table  <dig>

differential expression among the known mirnas was inferred by mirnakey, based on the widely-accepted assumption that the number of reads mapped to each mirna is relative to its level of expression  <cit> . the reads numbers in each sample were normalized to rpm values, and the relative expression levels of the different mirnas in the two samples were calculated. in general, mirna expression was similar in the cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia. the majority of mirnas with rpm >  <dig> were found in both tissues , with  <dig> found only in the cochlea and  <dig> found only in the vestibule . the rates of the highest expressing mirnas in each tissue were also highly similar between tissues  . we defined a mirna as differentially expressed if the fold change between samples was higher than  <dig> and p < 10− <dig> . eleven mirnas were differentially expressed in cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia .figure  <dig>

targets for most highly expressed mirnas
mirnas and targets exert their function through regulation of biological processes. as each mirna can have multiple targets, we performed an analysis to discover additional mrna genes that are computationally predicted to be targets of the three most highly expressed mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir-181a and mir-26a. among numerous predictions, a few were of particular interest due to their involvement in auditory function. the targets were defined according to their presence in the list of genes that are associated with deafness in the mouse genome informatics   database and predicted by two prediction algorithms, targetscanmouse and miranda . all mirna targets presented are involved in auditory function and hearing loss. as a few of the predicted targets overlap, we postulated that there might be underlying regulatory networks prompted by these mirnas. this was further illustrated using gene ontology  of biological-based processes, performed by genemania , where 6/ <dig> genes fell in the categories ‘sensory perception of sound’ and ‘sensory perception of mechanical stimulus,’ while 5/ <dig> genes fell in the categories ‘inner ear development’ and ‘ear development’ . these predictions may set the basis for signaling pathways in the inner ear, subject to experimental validation.table  <dig>

identification of inner ear mirnas
in order to identify inner ear mirnas, the genes associated with “impaired hearing”  and “deafness”  were downloaded from mgi . since these genes are crucial for inner ear development and function, we predicted that mirnas that reside in their introns may have a role in the inner ear. out of the hearing associated genes, ten had pri-mirnas in their introns . one pri-mirna, expressed in both cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia with an rpm >  <dig>  was found in the intron of deafness-related gene β-tectorin  , which is expressed in the mouse inner ear and associated with altered hearing  <cit> . this pri-mirna produces two mature mirnas, mir-6715-3p and mir-6715-5p . these mirs were supported by  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads per million library reads, respectively . these mirs were also found in an analysis of sequences from mouse data sets derived from different tissues  <cit> . provisional id chr19_ <dig>  available on mirbase , was detected by an extremely low number of reads  in oocytes, embryonic day  <dig>  embryo, e <dig>  brain, hippocampus, heart, skin, muscle cells, lung and liver by rna-seq.figure  <dig>

expression of new inner ear mirnas
the expression of mir-6715a-3p and mir-6715a-5p, detected by rna-seq, was validated by qrt-pcr analysis . we found both mirnas to be expressed in the sensory epithelium of the mouse cochlea, at e <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  the expression of both mirnas was dynamic and increased with age, showing higher expression at p <dig> compared to p <dig> and e <dig>  and at p <dig> compared to e <dig> . the two mirnas were undetected in brain, liver, kidney and heart. this is consistent with the previous rna-seq detection  <cit> . the inner ear expression, and the absence or very low expression of the mirnas in other tested tissues, suggests that they are inner ear-specific mirnas. the expression prior to the onset of hearing suggests a developmental role for these mirnas.figure  <dig>

in order to explore the spatial expression pattern of the two inner ear mirnas, in situ hybridization analysis was performed on inner ears derived from p <dig> c57/bl <dig> mice, at the same age the rna-seq was performed. consistent with the qrt-pcr results, expression of the two mirnas was observed in p <dig> mice . a clear staining of both mirnas was observed in many parts of the inner ear, in spiral and vestibular ganglia, basilar membrane and reissner's membrane, the stria vascularis and spiral ligament. in a higher magnification, in the cochlea, expression of both mirnas was observed in the organ of corti, in the spiral limbus and in particular in the hair and supporting cells. in the vestibular system, staining was observed in sensory epithelia of the saccule and the utricle, in hair and supporting cells.

target pathways in auditory and vestibular function
in order to determine what pathway might be impacted by mir-6715-3p and mir-6715-5p regulation, we searched for potential targets. targets were predicted by targetscan custom, which searches for a complementary 3’utr given a putative seed sequence. mir-6715-3p and mir-6715-5p were each predicted to target  <dig> and  <dig> targets, respectively, with ten overlapping targets . we examined which potential targets were inner ear-expressing genes, genes associated with hearing loss in human or mice, or genes encoding proteins involved in pathways relevant for inner ear function. these included protocadherin  <dig>   <cit>  as a candidate target for mir-6715-5p, and vezatin   <cit> , scn8a  <cit>  and arhgap <dig>  <cit>  as candidate targets for mir-6715-3p.to test whether these potential targets have a direct interaction with mir-6715-3p and mir-6715-5p, we examined luciferase activity by inserting the 3’utr of the potential targets downstream of a luciferase gene. transfections of these constructs, together with a pre mir- <dig> expressing vector into hek293t cells, and measurement of the relative luciferase activity compared to a mutant 3’utr construct, were indicative of targeting. pcdh <dig> was found to be a direct target of mir-6715a-5p , with a reduction of luciferase activity by approximately 35%. vezt and arhgap <dig> were found to be direct targets of mir-6715-3p, with a reduction of luciferase activity by 55% and 15%, respectively . snc8a is not a direct target of mir-6715a-3p, as luciferase activity was not reduced .figure  <dig>

arhgap <dig> was chosen for further analysis, due to its putative role as a gtpase activating protein  for small g proteins and expression in epithelial cell–cell junctions  <cit> . temporal expression of arhgap <dig> mrna was evaluated by qrt–pcr in the cochlear sensory epithelium. in the cochlea, arhgap <dig> was expressed at e <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  with a small, though not significant, increase in age . this protein was not previously characterized in the inner ear. we found arhgap <dig> expression, using a commercial antibody examined for specificity by peptide competition  in the organ of corti, in hair and supporting cells, the stria vascularis, spiral ligament and reissner’s membrane . the strongest expression was observed in nerve cells, in the spiral ganglia . in the vestibule, expression was found in the hair and supporting cells . in whole mount preparations, arhgap <dig> was found to be present in hair and supporting cells . its expression was observed in the same hair cell and cuticular plate planes as zo- <dig>  but did not overlap . the outer hair cell and deiter cell junctions expresses zo- <dig>  while arhgap <dig> appears absent in these junctions. arhgap <dig> appears in the kinocilium .figure  <dig>

discussion
the function of mirnas and their targets in the mammalian inner ear are now being discovered, as the link between mirnas and hearing and deafness has been established. the inner ear is a complex tissue with multiple cell types, with mirnas involved in fine-tuning the multitude pathways required for functional hearing. while there are a relatively small number of mirnas in mammals, their role in regulation far surpasses their number, since each mirna can exert its effect on hundreds of downstream targets  <cit> . hundreds of mirnas have been discovered in the inner ear; only a subset of these mirnas have validated targets .

our study was designed to profile the general expression of mirnas in the inner ear and a comparison of the auditory and vestibular epithelia. we chose the time point of p <dig> since work by our group  <cit>  and others have demonstrated that mirnas are expressed and functional at this stage, including mirna- <dig>  which is essential for hearing  <cit> . rna-seq analysis led to the identification of over  <dig> mirnas, with mir- <dig> as the most highly expressed mirna in both sensory epithelia  and accounting for more than 50% of the  <dig> most highly expressed mirnas. a few targets have been confirmed for mir- <dig>  including sox <dig>  clic <dig> and tbx <dig> . the second most abundant mirna in the cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia, mir-181a-5p, has no known validated targets in the inner ear. this mirna has been studied in other systems and found to have a pro-proliferative role in cultured human myeloid leukemia cells  <cit>  and regulates thymic selection in mouse t-cells  <cit> . the role of this mirna has been studied in the avian inner ear, where it has been shown to promote proliferation  <cit> .

we validated a number of targets for mir-6715-3p and mir-6715-5p. predicted targets for the mirnas described in this study have direct or potential implications for hearing loss. pcdh <dig> is expressed in the zebrafish inner ear  <cit> . mutations in protocadherin  <dig>  have been associated with x chromosome-linked epilepsy and mental retardation and it is a member of the protocadherin family of proteins  <cit> . this family includes protocadherin  <dig> , with a known function in the tip links of the stereocilia of the inner ear in conjunction with cadherin  <dig>  <cit>  and has been associated with multiple mutations in both non-syndromic and syndromic hearing loss in humans  <cit> .

vezatin  is an adherens junctions transmembrane protein, and while it is ubiquitously expressed in these junctions, it is especially prevalent in in hair and supporting cells of the mouse inner ear  <cit> . vezt mutant mice suffer from late onset progressive hearing loss, due to hair cell apoptosis. most compelling, the resistance of the organ of corti to mechanical stress was reduced when vezatin was absent in the inner ears of conditional mutants. these studies led to the prediction that vezation is required to maintain junction integrity and is crucial to protect the junctions from mechanical stress due to sound trauma.

arhgap <dig>  a rho gtpase activating protein  family member, is a component of cell–cell junctions in kidney epithelial cells  <cit> . while not previously known to be expressed in the inner ear, its target, rac <dig>  localizes to hair and supporting cells, specifically in the stereocilia and kinocilium of the hair cells. it was found to be involved in hair cell morphogenesis, specifically in hair bundle development, epithelia actin assembly and cell adhesion. inactivation of rac <dig> specifically in the otic epithelium leads to defects in cochlear morphogenesis, hair bundle orientation and cellular organization of the organ of corti  <cit> . arhgap <dig> was found to target rac <dig> and inactivates it by increasing gtp hydrolysis  <cit> . here we suggest a key role for mir-6715-3p in targeting arhagap <dig> and in this fashion, influencing rac <dig> in the inner ear .figure  <dig> 
a newly identified mirna-target regulatory pathway in the inner ear. a suggested pathway for mir-6715-3p and arhgap <dig>  whereby mir-6715-3p down-regulates expression of arhgap <dig>  which in turn blocks the hydrolysis of rac <dig>  gtpase. this may result in increased cell adhesion, actin reorganization and inner ear morphogenesis.



arhgap <dig>  a gap protein, is involved in controlling the time period in which rac <dig> will remain active. in mdck cells, arhgap <dig> expression overlaps with rac <dig> expression  <cit> , probably due to the regulation of arhgap <dig> on rac <dig> at this time point. in the inner ear, besides the actin-rich areas, rac <dig> is localized to hair cells and in particular, the kinocilium  <cit> . in accordance with our data, arhgap <dig>  at p <dig>  with expression in the hair cells and kinocilium, might be regulating by rac <dig> at this time, when the hair bundle is still developing and needs to be under close regulation. the kinocilium is necessary for proper development  <cit>  and may have a structural role in guiding the architecture of the hair bundle and/or be involved in g-protein signaling in the kinocilium. if the latter is true, then arhgap <dig> may regulate its gtpase activity. in our model of the mir-6715-3p circuit in the inner ear, we propose that the mirna indirectly enhances the action of rac <dig> and therefore may promote hair bundle development, actin reorganization, cell adhesion and inner ear morphogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of inner ear-related mirnas by rna-seq analysis demonstrates that the dataset is reliable not only for characterizing expression profiles of known mirnas, but also for discovery of novel mirnas in the inner ear. further investigation of these mirnas may shed light on their regulatory roles in various molecular pathways underlying the development of the embryonic inner ear.
