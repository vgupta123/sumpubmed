BACKGROUND
the increase in outbreaks of severe and fatal neurological disease caused by west nile virus  is a cause for concern worldwide. this emerging zoonotic pathogen is primarily transmitted by culex species mosquitoes in enzootic cycles where migratory birds serve as the reservoir host  <cit> . the frequency of infections in incidental hosts, including humans and horses has increased over the past decade  <cit> .

wnv has a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome approximately  <dig> kb in length  <cit> . the wnv genome encodes a single open reading frame  which is flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions   <cit> . the polyprotein, approximately  <dig> amino acid  in length, is cleaved into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins  <cit> . the structural proteins are required for virion formation and include the capsid protein , premembrane protein  and envelope protein   <cit> . the non-structural  proteins are required for viral genome replication and include ns <dig>  ns2a, ns2b, ns <dig>  ns4a, ns4b and ns <dig>  <cit> .

eight distinct phylogenetic lineages have been proposed recently, of which lineages  <dig> and  <dig> are most widespread  <cit> . lineage  <dig> strains have received a lot of attention as an emerging pathogen over the last two decades, and have been reported in austria, europe, north america and north africa  <cit> . in contrast, lineage  <dig> strains have only recently been reported outside their historical geographic range of madagascar and south africa. lineage  <dig> strains have reportedly been circulating in hungary   <cit> , austria   <cit> , greece   <cit>  and italy   <cit> .

the key mechanism for the generation of genetic diversity in wnv populations is mutation  <cit> . the wnv genome is subject to high mutation rates resulting from high error rates and the lack of proofreading ability of the rna-dependent rna polymerase  <cit> . mutational change in structural and non-structural regions of the viral genome markedly influences cell tropism and host range  <cit> . the ability of a virus to cause infection depends on the recognition of cell surface receptors and intracellular host factors that permit virion multiplication and release  <cit> . although genetic and phenotypic barriers provide the parameters associated with changes in cell tropism or host range, the evolutionary dynamics of viral subpopulations that accompany these changes are poorly understood  <cit> .

this underlying population variation, termed viral quasispecies, is defined as a rna population composed of a diverse mutant spectrum surrounding a master- or most dominant genotype that displays the highest fitness  <cit> . large population sizes coupled with high mutation rates during viral replication result in increased genetic diversity within the mutant spectrum  <cit> . the heterogeneous viral strains present in viral quasispecies are classified into two components of variants, namely majority- and minority variants  <cit> . interactions amongst components of the mutant spectrum determine the biological behaviour and phenotypic traits of a virus, and subsequently modulate the genetic diversity that is transmitted from infected hosts to susceptible hosts. the evolution of quasispecies is the result of evolutionary events that target the components of the mutant spectrum instead of the consesus genotype  <cit> . as a result, changes in quasispecies composition may take place without modification of the consensus genotype often interpreted as evolutionary stasis, potentially confounding identification of the genetic changes responsible for wnv emergence  <cit> .

drivers of wnv emergence, in particular genetic change, have been studied extensively in lineage  <dig> isolates after their introduction to the americas. the majority of these studies, however, primarily focus on comparative analysis between genomic sequences generated from the consensus of all aligned reads of an isolate following whole genome sequencing  <cit> . although ngs offers a cost effective, high-throughput method to generate hundreds to millions of short read genetic data in a single run, it has been utilised mostly for re-sequencing and comparative analyses of wnv  <cit> . studies concerned with the maintenance of mutation-selection equilibria in wnv minority population variants throughout the time of emergence are, furthermore, greatly understated, especially so for lineage  <dig> wnv strains  <cit> .

advances in bioinformatic applications that reconstruct full-length haplotypes residing in viral quasispecies from ultra deep sequence data present a cost-effective and high-throughput method to study the presence and evolution of minority variants  <cit> . in this instance, each of the high number of sequence reads acquired from ultra deep sequencing is assumed to originate from an individual replicion, revealing meaningful underlying genetic variation  <cit> . in overcoming errors associated with pcr amplification, ultra deep sequencing, read filtering, read alignment, and the accurate detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms , haplotype reconstruction does not only provide insight into within-host viral evolution, but also epidemiological insight into dissecting possible transmission events  <cit> .

this study presents the application of haplotype reconstruction from ultra deep sequence data to investigate the evolution of minority population variants of a historic south african lineage  <dig> wnv strain. the selective pressures that accompany changes in propagation environment was used as a simple model to firstly, study the influence of minority variant evolution on the consensus genome and secondly, to study the evolution and persistence of minority variants as individual replicons in the viral population. we present a cost-effective and high-throughput approach to the reconstruction of viral quasispecies that mitigates the main sources of possible sequence errors and biases. we confirm the results inferred from haplotype reconstruction by comparing single nucleotide polymorphism  profiles generated from the same sequence data in each instance where changes in propagation system were brought about. results illustrate that minority variants contributing to cell-tropism persist in the viral population without contributing to changes in the consensus genome. minority variants are shown, furthermore, to maintain a stable mutation-selection equilibrium under positive selection, particularly in the capsid gene region.

RESULTS
consensus genomes
the consensus genome of isolates propagated in mouse brain, bhk- <dig> cell cultures, and isolates that were switched from one propagation system to another displayed no genetic changes in the consensus genome sequence of isolate wnv 349/ <dig> . the lack of variation observed amongst consensus genome sequences of isolates wnv  <dig> and wnv 349/ <dig> is suggestive of a well-maintained mutation-selection equilibrium within the environment in which the respective isolates were propagated.

snp occurrence
a combined total of  <dig> unique snps were detected amongst all wnv 349/ <dig> isolates . the number of snps that occurred in all five isolates comprised 7% of the combined total number of snps . the number of snps shared amongst four isolates, three isolates and two isolates was 4%, 11% and 9% respectively of the total combined number of snps each . the remaining 69% of the snps were unique to just one of the five isolates sequenced .figure  <dig> 
position and number of snps of wnv 349/ <dig> isolates. the genomes of isolates c <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig>  f <dig>  and g <dig> are each depicted by magenta bands. the numbers in the diagram depict the nucleotide position at which snps were detected. genomes are connected to nucleotide positions where snps occur by means of a colour-coded ribbon. in the instance where a snp is present in both genomes at the same nucleotide position, the nucleotide position is connected to both genomes by two similarly coloured ribbons.



in order to identify gene regions most influenced by changes in propagations system, the diversity of gene regions were compared based on the number of snps observed. the standardised number of snps per gene region for wnv 349/ <dig> isolates was illustrated in figure  <dig>  the most variable region was identified as the 5′utr region, followed by the 3′utr region, the capsid gene region, the ns4b region, the membrane gene region, the envelope gene region, the ns <dig> region, the ns <dig> region, the ns4a region and lastly the ns <dig> and ns2a regions . the highest variation in number of snps between the respective isolates of wnv 349/ <dig> was observed for the 5′utr region, followed by the 3′utr region, the capsid gene region, the membrane gene region, the envelope gene region, the ns4b region, the ns2a region, the ns <dig> region, the ns <dig> region, the ns4a region and lastly the ns <dig> and ns2a regions .figure  <dig>

snp frequency
the snps that occurred in all wnv 349/ <dig> isolates and their respective frequencies based on the major allele are illustrated in figure  <dig>  the major allele at each snp position remained identical between wnv 349/ <dig> isolates, with the exception of snps at position  <dig> and  <dig>  the snp in position  <dig> is situated in the envelope gene region. whereas thymine is observed in position  <dig> in the wnv 349/ <dig> consensus genome, cytosine was observed in isolate c <dig> at a frequency of  <dig> . this non-synonymous substitution resulted in an amino acid change from phenylalanine in the wnv 349/ <dig> consensus genome to an arginine in isolate c <dig>  this suggests that the substitution in position  <dig> is under positive selection when the wnv 349/ <dig> strain is passaged in mouse brain, and that the associated changes to the envelope protein confer elevated fitness in this propagation system.figure  <dig>

similarly, the snp in position  <dig> is situated in the envelope gene region. the wnv 349/ <dig> consensus genome contains adenine in this position, whereas guanine is observed in isolate c <dig> and isolate d <dig> at a frequency of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this non-synomous substitution resulted in an amino acid change from isoleucine in the wnv 349/ <dig> consensus genome to valine in isolates c <dig> and d <dig>  interestingly, adenine is observed at a frequency of  <dig>  in isolate f <dig>  although the latter is agreement with the wnv 349/ <dig> consensus genome, the frequency shows little deviation from that of guanine observed in isolate c <dig>  both isolate c <dig> and isolate f <dig> were propagated in mouse brain, but differed in the total number of passages with isolate c <dig> being passaged eight times and isolate f <dig> nine times. in contrast, isolate d <dig>  was passaged  <dig> times in bhk- <dig> cell culture followed by one passage in mouse brain. when considering the passage history of all three isolates, the significance of the snp at position  <dig> becomes apparent. firstly, the results suggest that quasispecies variants of wnv 349/ <dig> that contain either adenine or guanine in position  <dig> are maintained at a near equal frequency in the population. secondly, the presence of adenine and the associated amino acid isoleucine in the envelope protein confers elevated fitness when wnv 349/ <dig> is passaged in mouse brain, and the population equilibrium shifts towards adenine in position  <dig> with the increase in passage number. in support of the latter, the high frequency at which guanine persists in isolate d <dig> when switching from three passages in bhk- <dig> cell culture to one passage in mouse brain suggests that the presence of guanine and the associated amino acid change to valine in the envelope protein confers elevated fitness in bhk- <dig> cell culture. the frequency of guanine declines sharply from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with increased number of passages in mouse brain as illustrated in isolate c <dig>  this suggests that adenine in position  <dig> is under positive selection when wnv 349/ <dig> is passaged in mouse brain, whereas guanine is under positive selection when passaged in bhk- <dig> cell culture.

the envelope protein  is the most conserved of flavivirus structural proteins and is the major protein found on the virion surface  <cit> . the e protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion, and has two transmembrane segments that function as signal sequences for the transloaction of ns <dig> into the er lumen  <cit> . both the snp’s at position  <dig> and  <dig> are situated in domain iii of the e protein. as such, the increase in frequency of variants in position  <dig> and  <dig> reported after passage in mouse brain is suggestive of selective pressures brought about by the changes in receptor binding and membrane fusion between the central nervous system in mice and other propagation systems.

haplotype occurrence
the haplotypes obtained consisted of full-length genomes aligned to the consensus genome of the isolate involved. the haplotypes obtained for isolate d <dig>  isolate e <dig>  isolate f <dig> and isolate g <dig> were compared . based on variation in the number of haplotypes amongst gene regions, the most variable region of the wnv 349/ <dig> genome was estimated as the 5′utr region, followed by the capsid gene region, the ns <dig> region, the envelope gene region, the ns2b region, the ns2a and ns4a regions, the ns <dig> region, the membrane gene region, and the ns <dig> and ns4b regions . according to the variation in number of haplotypes between wnv 349/ <dig> isolates within each gene region, the most variable regions were the 5′utr region and the capsid gene region. these findings are in agreement with the gene regions found to be most variable according to snp data.figure  <dig>

haplotype frequency
the frequencies of viable haplotypes that were present in more than one isolate were compared in order to study the influence of propagation system on the quasispecies composition of wnv 349/ <dig>  the shared haplotypes were renamed haplotype  <dig> through to haplotype  <dig> and grouped according to the gene region in which each respective haplotype displayed variation. the variation in haplotype frequency between isolates is illustrated in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
frequency of viable haplotypes present in each respective wnv 349/ <dig> isolate.




haplotypes that varied most in frequency between isolates were observed in the capsid gene region, followed by the envelope gene region and the ns2a region . the frequency of haplotype  <dig> differed most between isolates, followed by haplotype  <dig> and haplotype  <dig> . for the purposes of this discussion, the emphasis will be placed on these three haplotypes.

haplotype  <dig> contained variation in the ns2a region between genome position  <dig> and  <dig>  a pairwise distance of  <dig>  was observed between the genome sequence of haplotype  <dig> and the wnv 349/ <dig> consensus genome. haplotype  <dig> was observed at a frequency of  <dig>  in isolate g <dig>   <dig>  in isolate e <dig> and  <dig>  in isolate f <dig> and was therefore most prevalent when wnv 349/ <dig> was passaged continuously in bhk- <dig> cells.

haplotype  <dig> differed in the envelope gene region from the consensus genome sequence of wnv 349/ <dig>  the pairwise distance between the genome sequence of haplotype  <dig> and the wnv 249/ <dig> consensus genome was estimated at  <dig> . haplotype  <dig> contained variation in the envelope gene region between genome position  <dig> and  <dig>  haplotype  <dig> was observed at a frequency of  <dig>  in isolate g <dig>   <dig>  in isolate e <dig> and  <dig>  in isolate f <dig>  haplotype  <dig> was therefore most prevalent when wnv 349/ <dig> was passaged continuously in bhk- <dig> cell culture, less prevalent when wnv 349/ <dig> was subjected to a change in propagation system, and least prevalent when propagated continuously in mice. similar to haplotype  <dig>  results suggest that haplotype  <dig> is subject to selection when wvn 349/ <dig> is propagated in bhk- <dig> cell culture.

the highest variation amongst wnv 349/ <dig> isolates was observed in haplotype  <dig>  a pairwise distance of  <dig>  was observed between the genome sequence of haplotype  <dig> and the wnv 349/ <dig> genome sequence. with respect to the wnv 349/ <dig> consensus genome, haplotype  <dig> contained variation in the capsid gene region between genome position  <dig> and  <dig>  haplotype  <dig> was most prevalent when wnv 349/ <dig> was subject to a change in propagation system from bhk- <dig> cell culture to mouse brain. an intermediate prevalence was observed when wnv 349/ <dig> was continuously passaged in mouse brain, and a low prevalence when passaged continuously in bhk- <dig> cell culture. the magnitude in frequency variation observed between propagation in a constant environment and that of a change in environment suggests that haplotype  <dig> provides a viable wild-type intermediate aiding in the process of adaptation. the latter indicates that the biological properties associated with the capsid protein that haplotype  <dig> encodes is under positive selection during the transition of bhk-cell culture to mouse brain, without ultimately contributing to the capsid region consensus genome.

both the 5′utr and 3′utr regions are highly variable amongst flavivirues  <cit> . the 3′utr and 5′utr contain common secondary structures necessary for genome replication . similarly, the ns2a gene region is poorly conserved  <cit> . the ns2a protein interacts with replicase components of virus replication and coordinates the shift between rna packaging and rna replication  <cit> . the high variation observed in the 5′utr region, the 3′utr region and the ns2a region in comparison with other gene regions is therefore expected to occur.

in contrast, the high variation observed in the capsid protein gene region of wnv 349/ <dig> is significant as the capsid protein forms an integral part in the assembly of infectious virions. the capsid protein facilitates membrane association and membrane protein  translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . the assembly of rna replication complexes, in turn, is known to occur on intracellular membranes  <cit> . as such, the increased variation in the capsid gene is suggestive of selection pressures brought about by differences in host cell type between propagation systems.

CONCLUSIONS
the lack of variation observed amongst consensus genome sequences of wnv 349/ <dig> isolates is suggestive of a well-maintained mutation-selection equilibrium within the environment in which respective isolates were propagated. this lack of variation in consensus nucleotide sequences is often interpreted as evolutionary stasis, and the underlying variation in the mutant spectrum that contributes to the consensus nucleotide sequence is neglected  <cit> . in this study, haplotype reconstruction from ultra-deep sequence data of a historic south african lineage  <dig> wnv strain revealed full-length haplotype genome sequences that depict this underlying variation. variant frequency is shown to fluctuate mostly in the capsid gene region as positive selection persists to enable cell-tropism subsequent to propagation system changes. this is the first instance in which the quasispecies dynamics that ensure the continuity of wnv minority variants contributing to cell-tropism were shown to persist in the viral population solely from ultra deep sequence data. this study presents a cost-effective, high-throughput and accurate approach to full-length haplotype reconstruction of viral quasispecies by introducing bioinformatic measures of sequence error corrrection.
