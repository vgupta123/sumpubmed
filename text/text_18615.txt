BACKGROUND
evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand the molecular genetic basis of phenotypic evolution. britten and davidson proposed that regulatory mutations play a crucial role in phenotypic evolution from their observations that a substantial proportion of repetitive sequences regulate expression in genomes  <cit> . a pioneering study by king and wilson found that the degree of divergence in protein sequences cannot account for the phenotypic differences between human and chimpanzee, and proposed that the evolution of anatomy was influenced to a greater extent by changes in gene regulation than by changes in protein sequence  <cit> . recently, carroll has put forward the proposal that the evolution of animal morphology is mainly attributable to mutations in the cis-regulatory regions of genes, instead of mutations in their protein-coding regions  <cit> . with the advent of large-scale genomic data, the role of positive selection in the evolution of protein coding sequences involved in phenotypic evolution is now known to have been underestimated. for example, the coding sequences of many genes involved in the development of the human brain have been shown to have evolved under positive selection, which may account for the rapid evolution of the human brain  <cit> . adaptive changes in the amino acid sequence of mc1r account for pigment adaptation including variations in skin and hair color in many species  <cit> . genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in humans have estimated that >10% of the amino acid substitutions in sequences that occurred between humans and chimpanzee may have been adaptive  <cit> . during short-term evolution within species, most mutations that cause morphological variation have been found in protein-coding regions  <cit> . in contrast, during the long-term evolution between species most mutations that cause morphological differences have been found in cis-regulatory regions. it has been proposed that this difference in abundance of coding and regulatory mutation in morphological characters is due to coding mutations within species not being able to spread through populations due to their pleiotropic deleterious effects  <cit> .

new genes also provide crucial material for evolutionary innovations. accumulating evidence supports the remarkable phenotypic effects of new genes in development  <cit> . for example, a pioneering study by chen et al  found that many new genes rapidly evolve to gain essential functions in drosophila, since knockdown experiments of many of these new genes by rna interference  leads to lethality at various development stages. it was also found that some of these new genes have important functions in the process of organogenesis in drosophila  <cit> . a functional association between new genes and newly evolved brain structure was observed in humans  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit> . in the human genome many new genes appear to have been recruited to function in the development of the brain  <cit> .

evolution of phenotypes is mainly determined by changes that occur in developmental processes. examination of evolutionary changes occurring in genes expressed during development should be helpful for understanding the roles of genetic innovation in phenotypic evolution. here, based on an analysis of gene co-expression networks at different developmental stages, we describe important roles for new genes, and rapid amino acid sequence evolution in genes, in development that might be responsible for specific aspects of phenotypic evolution in drosophila melanogaster.

RESULTS
analysis of gene co-expression networks derived from transcriptomes of different developmental stages of drosophila melanogaster
transcriptomes from early developmental stages and diverse adult tissues in drosophila melanogaster studied in  <cit>  were used for identifying new transcripts and calculating the expression values for genes . genes involved in the same biological process tend to have expression levels that are highly correlated across samples. identification of groups of co-regulated genes, or “modules”, should be informative for identifying specific features of developmental stages/tissues/cells. we implemented a weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit>  to identify modules of co-expressed genes during different stages of development in drosophila melanogaster. this approach has been successfully employed to deduce regulatory networks in the developing human brain  <cit> . here, a total of  <dig> coexpression modules  were obtained for drosophila development. many of the modules were developmental stage-specific , for example, m <dig> is correlated, with high significance, with the 2-4 hr embryonic developmental state , and m <dig> is strongly correlated, with high significance, with adult females 30 days after eclosion .

the bristle screen online database  <cit>  was used to search for essential genes . this database contained  <dig>  transgenic rnai lines that are predicted to target  <dig>  of the  <dig>  protein-coding genes  in release  <dig>  of the drosophila genome. lethality described in this database included several categories: completely lethal ; some lethality ; and lines that showed some phenotype with the accompanying lethality . of the  <dig>  drosophila reference genes present in our modules,  <dig>  were included in the  <dig>  lines with knock-down data in the bristle screen database, with  <dig>  genes  showing completely lethality . the analysis was then expanded to include all of the genes  represented in our modules. a total of  <dig>  genes, represented by  <dig>  rnai lines, from the bristle screen database, were represented in our modules, with  <dig>  of the genes  showing complete lethality . from this analysis, three modules, m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  were identified as being significantly enriched with lethal genes  . expression of genes in module m <dig> are significantly associated with the white prepupae  stages , genes in module m <dig> are significantly correlated with the 0-2 hr embryo stage  and genes in module m <dig> are significantly associated with the 10-12 hr embryo development stage , revealing essential roles for these highly expressed genes in these developmental stages. the 0-2 hr embryo stage, i.e. the specific stage of module m <dig>  is the maternal to zygotic transition period in drosophila  <cit> . consistent with this period in development, gene ontology analysis revealed that genes in module m <dig> are enriched in biological categories associated with chromatin organization , transcription , cell cycle , development  and morphogenesis  . these data suggest an essential function for these genes in the maternal to zygotic transition period.figure  <dig>

developmental stage-specific enrichment of new genes revealed by gene co-expression networks in drosophila melanogaster
we identified a total of  <dig> new genes including newly duplicated and young orphan genes , specific to drosophila melanogaster. we then identified which modules, and developmental stages, were enriched with new genes in drosophila melanogaster. significant enrichment in new genes was found in  <dig> modules, m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  , where these modules are significantly correlated with wpp + 2 days fat , stage l <dig> larvae , dark blue gut ps in stage l <dig> larvae , 4 day post-eclosion testes in adult males , 12 hr post-molt stage l <dig> larvae  and 20-22 hr embryo stages , respectively . gene expression analysis of the new genes enriched in these six modules also showed consistent specific high levels of expression in their associated developmental stages, supporting potential roles of these new genes in these tissues/developmental stages . pca analysis  also found an inseparable relationship of the new genes with other genes in these modules, supporting the potential gene co-expression network .figure  <dig>

when we considered young duplicated genes, we found that young duplicated genes are significantly enriched in  <dig> modules, m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>   , which are significantly correlated with the dark blue gut ps in stage l <dig> larvae , 4 day post-eclosion testes in adult males , stage l <dig> larvae , 12 hr post-molt stage l <dig> larvae , 20-22 hr embryos , 4 days post-eclosion accessory glands in adult males , and 18-20 hr embryo stages , respectively . these observations support the previously reported testis-bias in the expression of some new genes, and that the function of these new genes in the evolution of phenotypes is determined by their expression in specific developmental stages. however, since as more tissues  and unique highly expressed genes were taken into account, only  <dig> genes among the  <dig> young genes are enriched in the m <dig> module correlated significantly with the testes. in addition, the significant clustering of the young genes with different co-expression modules that correlate with different tissues/developmental stages also suggests that the young genes might operate in many different functional classes, and not only in the testis. for example, gene ontology analysis of these  <dig> modules with young genes revealed that genes in the module m <dig> are enriched in functions that are integral component of membranes   and that genes in the module m <dig> are enriched in the aromatic amino acid family metabolic process  and the oxidation reduction process , revealing potential functions for these new genes in these processes .

our searches identified  <dig> young orphan genes that show no homology with proteins in other species .  <dig> orphan genes were significantly enriched in  <dig> modules, m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  . among these six modules, m <dig> is correlated with 4 day post-eclosion testes in adult males , m <dig> is correlated with dark blue gut ps in stage l <dig> larvae , m <dig> is correlated with stage l <dig> larvae , m <dig> was correlated with 12 hr post-molt stage l <dig> larvae , m <dig> is corrected with wpp + 2 days fat , and m <dig> is corrected with mixed adult male and female carcass 4 days post-eclosion  , suggesting that these new genes have roles in these stages of development.

the young genes were then queried against the bristle screen online database  <cit>  where we found that among the  <dig> young duplicated genes  having knock-down data,  <dig> genes  were completely lethal . the proportion of young genes showing lethality  was slightly lower than the genome wide value . among the orphan genes,  <dig>  have knock-down data in the bristle screen database, with only  <dig> gene  being completely lethal . our results, of a low proportion of lethality in young genes, contrasts with a previous conclusion that young genes have a similar proportion of lethality as old genes  <cit> , a result that might have been attributable to the off target effects of rnai on duplicated genes, producing false positives for the essentiality of the young duplicated genes. more accurate experimental methods for knocking down/out genes in drosophila are necessary to evaluate the essentiality of young genes.

roles for specific lncrnas in development revealed from the gene co-expression network analysis
we assembled  <dig> - <dig>  new transcripts from the transcriptome data from  <dig> drosophila species . in drosophila melanogaster,  <dig> of the newly assembled transcripts, from  <dig> genes, were identified as linage-specific lncrnas that have no homology with transcripts in any other species. among these new lncrna genes,  <dig> were found to be significantly associated with  <dig> modules, with  <dig> of the modules, m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig>  significantly enriched with drosophila melanogaster specific lncrnas  . of these six modules, m <dig> is correlated with the adult male 30 days after eclosion stage , m <dig> was correlated with the pupae 12 hr after wpp , m <dig> is correlated with pupae 2 days after wpp , m <dig> is corrected with stage l <dig> cns , m <dig> is corrected with stage l <dig> imaginal discs , and m <dig> is corrected with heads of mated adult males 20 days post-eclosion . we then used the genes in each of the modules where lncrnas are enriched to conduct a gene ontology analysis, which may suggest potential functions for the lncrnas. for example, genes in module m <dig> are enriched in odorant binding , sensory perception of smell , olfactory receptor activity  and neurological system process , suggesting a potential function of some of the lncrnas in regulating expression of sensory perception genes. in addition, genes in module m <dig> are enriched in the defense response , genes in module m <dig> are enriched in proteolysis , and genes in module m <dig> are enriched in photo transduction  , suggesting that lncrnas may have regulatory roles in these processes. although the functions of the lncrnas remain unclear, co-expression data provides information that could be examined in future studies.figure  <dig>

essentiality of positively selected genes in drosophila
 <dig>  one-to-one orthologs among drosophila melanogaster, d. annanassae, d. sechellia, d. yakuba and d. erecta were retrieved from the ensemblmetazoa database . after alignment and trimming,  <dig>  orthologs remained for use in the detection of positive selection employing the branch site model of paml  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> positive selected genes  were identified in the drosophila melanogaster and d. sechellia lineages, respectively. of the one-to-one orthologs,  <dig>   have knock-down data in the bristle screen database, with  <dig>  genes  being completely lethal. among the  <dig> psgs,  <dig> genes  with knock-down data in drosophila melanogaster, with  <dig> of these genes  being completely lethal  . in drosophila sechellia, among the  <dig> psgs,  <dig> gene did not have detectable expression in the drosophila melanogaster transcriptome datasets and  <dig> gene was placed in the non-sense module. the remaining  <dig> genes were distributed into  <dig> modules, with  <dig>  of the  <dig> psgs  being completely lethal .

excluding one gene that had no detectable expression in the transcriptome datasets,  <dig> psgs in drosophila melanogaster were distributed into  <dig> modules and were significantly enriched in m <dig>  . module m <dig> is significantly correlated with the 0-2 hr embryo stage , and this module is also significantly enriched with lethal genes . enrichment of lethal genes also points to the importance of module m <dig>  among the  <dig> psgs with completely lethality in drosophila melanogaster,  <dig> are distributed to module m <dig>  these data demonstrate that psgs have essential functions, although they show rapid evolution with amino acid sequence changes driven by positive selection.

discussion
roles for new genes in development revealed by gene co-expression network analysis
early developmental stages are very important for establishing phenotypes of later stages. based on our gene co-expression network analysis, we observed that the non-random distribution of essential genes at early developmental stages in drosophila development leads to different developmental stages showing varying levels of essentiality. for example, the 0-2 hr embryonic stage, which is the maternal to zygotic transition period in drosophila, has enriched expression of essential genes, suggesting that the contribution of gene expression of these genes in this period of developmental time is important for phenotype evolution in drosophila. similarly, we found that the expression of new genes, including young protein coding and lncrna genes, are also not randomly distributed during early development, and is significantly enriched in modules that correlate with specific developmental stages. this also suggests that these new genes also play roles in the evolution of specific phenotypes. new genes provide crucial material for evolutionary innovation, and evidence has been accumulating supporting the remarkable phenotypic effects of new genes in development. a pioneering study by chen et al  found that many new genes rapidly evolve essential functions in drosophila, as the knockdown of expression many of these new genes by rna interference  leads to lethality at various stages of drosophila development  <cit> . enrichment of new genes in early developmental stages supports a role for adaptive function by new genes at early developmental stages. for example, in human, the recruitment of young genes into the early developmental stages of neocortex was found to account potentially for the evolution of cognitive ability  <cit> . many studies have found a remarkable divergence between related species both in their early and late development, which is consistent with the hourglass model of development, although it has been proposed by others that genes expressed in early stages of development should be highly conserved  <cit> . recruitment of newly originated genes at early stages of developmental might allow evolution of specific phenotypes, while conserved genes retain function for the conserved core of development.

roles for positively selected genes in development
with the advent of large-scale genomic data, large numbers of positively selected adaptive mutations in the coding sequences of genes involved in the evolution of phenotypes, including morphological and physiological traits, have been identified  <cit> . here, positively selected genes showing rapid amino acid sequence change specific to the drosophila melanogaster lineage were identified, with some of these genes found to be essential as knock-down leads to lethality. the correlation between evolutionary rate and essentiality of genes is weak  <cit> , where gene essentiality tends to be associated with adaptive evolution in protein sequence. although, the functional shifts caused by amino acid changes in psgs are often unclear, mutations driven by positive selection appear to contribute significantly to the evolution of the phenotypes generated by the psgs. enrichment of psgs among gene co-expression modules correlated with early developmental stages supports the hypothesis that changes in the amino acid sequences of psgs leads to phenotypic evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
young genes, including duplicated, orphan, and young lncrna genes, are significantly enriched among modules associated with specific developmental stages. in addition, genes undergoing rapid amino acid sequence evolution driven by positive selection showed a similar proportion of essentiality with other genes, and enrichment at module of specific developmental stages. our integrative analysis revealed important roles for the origin of new genes and rapid amino acid sequence evolution in development that may account for specific phenotype evolution in drosophila melanogaster to some extent.
