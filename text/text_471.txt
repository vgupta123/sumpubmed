BACKGROUND
an essential gene is defined as a gene necessary for the growth and maintenance of an organism  <cit> . identifying a set of essential genes for a given condition, is of significant importance for a number of reasons:  for understanding pathogen biology: identification will help in prioritizing the set of genes for functional studies;  from an evolutionary perspective: since a distinct correlation is suggested between essentiality and extent of conservation in a given family or class of organisms  <cit> ;  in drug discovery: essential genes in a pathogenic species form a ready shortlist of possible drug targets  <cit> . essentiality to the pathogen is in fact one of the key criteria for defining a drug target  <cit> ;  essentiality also serves as a useful parameter in biomarker identification, since by definition, an essential gene is necessarily present in the pathogen  <cit> ;  from a synthetic biology perspective, an essential gene set should overlap extensively with the minimal gene set required for survival of the organism and hence an identification of the essential set also forms a starting point for future work towards synthetic reconstruction of the organism  <cit> . as whole genome sequences of a large number of species are being deciphered and omics data covering various aspects are accumulated, a number of both experimental and computational methods are being explored to identify essential genes  <cit> . there are reports based on functional genomics studies of several organisms, which indicate that only  <dig> - 20% of the genes are essential to the organism under a given condition  <cit> .

approaches used for identification of essential gene set include classical forward genetic screens  <cit> , genome-wide rna interference screens  <cit>  and targeted gene knockouts  <cit> . typically, a given gene is deleted or inactivated by one of the listed techniques and if the resulting mutant strain leads to ‘loss of function’ , in terms of the loss of viability of the organism, the given gene is said to be essential. whole genome transposon mutagenesis, which involves exploitation of transposon or mobile dna elements, as mutagens, so as to inactivate the gene, has been applied to a number of organisms  <cit> . the basic premise in these is that, the inability of the bacterium to survive due to the disruption of gene expression by the inserted transposon indicates essentiality of the disrupted gene. databases such as deg  <cit> , and ogee  <cit>  have also been developed, that combine information about essential genes in a number of organisms based on extensive literature survey. while, each of these methods has tremendous advantages, they come with their own limitations as well and hence cannot be expected to identify essential genes comprehensively. even when successful, these techniques do not provide any mechanistic insights about why a particular gene is essential.

computational methods to probe essentiality have mainly involved identification of orthologs in related organisms and assessing phyletic retention. sequence features such as gc-content, codon usage, and localization signals have also been used for inferring essentiality, although these have been found to be less accurate  <cit> . rio and coworkers have reported a method for identification of essential genes from large interaction networks and report significant prediction accuracy by using a combination of network parameters and centrality measures  <cit> . plaimas and coworkers  <cit>  apply a machine learning approach to identify essential genes in bacterial metabolic networks, wherein features characterizing network topology, sequence information and co-expression profiling were utilized for training, which was further applied to identify drug targets in salmonella typhimurium. constraint-based metabolic modeling approaches such as flux balance analysis have been used to analyse genome-scale metabolic networks in several organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, helicobacter pylori, mycoplasma genitalium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. simulation of virtual knockouts of genes in these networks is helpful in inferring essentiality  <cit> . very recently karr et al. <cit>  have built a whole cell computational model of the life cycle of mycoplasma genitalium, wherein the cell was divided into different modules based on the functional capacity of each module. each module was then independently modeled using mathematical tools that best suits the model: fba for metabolism, poisson processes for rna and protein degradation. the built model thus could accurately reproduce experimental data and provide insight into many biological processes. such studies highlight the importance of integrating different mathematical or computational aspects for different biological processes. different computational methods capture different aspects that define why a gene is essential and hence, no method individually is sufficient to provide a powerful predictive tool, warranting exploration of newer approaches for studying essentiality.

essentiality is inherently a systems property  <cit> . a gene known to have an important function may not be essential in the whole system due to genetic redundancy or functional pleiotropy  <cit> . the loss of some genes can be compensated by alternate pathways to reach the same biochemical goal. in other cases the function of the gene may not be essential for growth or survival, but may have some specialized function such as imparting virulence  <cit> . a systems approach, therefore, becomes necessary to address these issues.

there are nearly two million deaths every year, translating to one death every 15-18 seconds, due to tuberculosis  <cit> . tuberculosis  has unfortunately retained the status, for number of decades, as being the leading killer among all infectious diseases. the strong synergy of the causative organism mycobacterium tuberculosis  with the deadly virus hiv has made the problem more acute. although a handful of drugs and vaccines are available for the treatment of this disease, the problem has remained acute due to difficulties in diagnosis, long periods of treatment, inability to tackle latent forms of the bacteria and more importantly the emergence of drug resistant varieties of m.tb such as mdr, xdr and tdr strains  <cit> . further research to understand the biology of the pathogen in a more wholistic approach and to apply the knowledge for the identification of newer and more efficient drug targeting strategies is thus urgently required. the whole genome sequencing of m.tb <cit> , about 15 years ago has triggered intense functional genomics studies on m.tb, leading to the accumulation of several types of omics data. several computational studies are also available  <cit> , adding to the resource base, making it feasible to address complex issues such as gene essentiality for this pathogen from an integrated perspective. methods to integrate various omics data into networks are also beginning to be described in literature  <cit> .

here we seek to study gene essentiality at multiple levels and at multiple scales of spatial resolution, to identify with high confidence, a set of essential genes in m.tb. the study uses a range of models at each level, including genome-scale interactome, metabolic network, individual pathways and biochemical reactions and finally individual amino acid residues in the proteins. computational approaches at systems, structural and sequence levels have thus been employed.

RESULTS
a new multi-level approach has been used to study gene essentiality. in brief, experimentally derived gene expression data from literature has been analysed to identify genes exhibiting consistent expression patterns in about  <dig> different sets of the same condition. next, flux balance analysis  of a genome-scale metabolic model integrated with gene expression values, has been carried out to identify essential genes through systematic, in silico gene knockouts . further, a directed, weighted genome-scale protein-protein interactome has been constructed and analysed to identify key points controlling the topology of the network. a large-scale sequence analysis has been carried out to test for those genes that have high phyletic retention in genomes of the same genus. the workflow followed in this study is illustrated in figure  <dig> and describes the different methods and filters that have been employed to derive essentiality. the set of essential genes so identified are analysed, using multiple sequence alignment, of the corresponding protein sequences, to obtain conserved amino acid residues which are then mapped on the functional sites in the protein to determine the basis of essentiality. put together, this study helps in addressing essentiality at the levels of modules in the network, pathways and at the level of individual proteins. to our knowledge, such an integrated approach has not been extensively explored earlier.

microarray data analysis
microarray analysis provides a global picture of the expression profiles of all the genes in an organism under a given condition. it is reasonable to assume that an essential gene ought to be expressed in the cell in sufficient quantities. although, expression by itself does not dictate function in a bacterial cell, consistent expression patterns of individual genes can be considered to provide a rough indication of the functional capacity of that gene in the cell. in this study, genes that exhibit consistent and high expression patterns in many samples of the same wild type  growth condition are grouped into a shortlist of probable candidates for essentiality. this is based on the premise that a cell expends its limited energy and resources towards protein synthesis only if the protein has certain functional significance for the survival of the cell  <cit> .

microarray based gene expression dataset considered for the present study consists of a total of  <dig> samples of the same wt condition, with  <dig> genes in each sample  <cit> . a scoring scheme was devised for all the genes in the genome that forms a continuous scaling measure . the score captures consistent expression in the  <dig> different microarrays used for the study and for a given expression level, those which show consistent expression, will have the highest scores. it is important to note here, that while high expression is not a necessary condition for the gene to be termed essential, consistent expression across biological samples of the same kind is required for a gene to be considered for essentiality. jeong et al. <cit>  have earlier shown the importance of consistency in gene expression data for predicting gene essentiality in yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae.

in this work, genes which appear up to the 50th percentile in the ranked list  were selected for further analysis. at this stage, since the intention is to obtain a shortlist for further analysis in the pipeline, a lenient cut-off of 50th percentile was chosen so as to avoid any false negatives. as many as  <dig> genes  out of  <dig> genes were identified by this criteria indicating that a large number of genes showed consistent and significant levels of expression. although it is theoretically possible to miss some genes that may be consistently expressed at very low levels, the rather broad cut-off used at this stage implies that whatever maybe missed will only be a small fraction, since of the  <dig> genes eliminated, most  showed generally low expression and large variations .

these  <dig> genes were further classified into different tuberculist  <cit>  functional classes. as can be seen from additional file 2: figure s <dig>  genes involved in metabolism and respiration form a major portion of the pie-chart . m.tb is known to have developed sophisticated mechanisms for cell-wall synthesis which is also reflected in the figure, with 20% of the genes falling in this category. 24% of this set is formed of conserved hypotheticals, highlighting the knowledge gaps that exist for m.tb. about 10% of the genome from this list is dedicated for pe and ppe families of proteins, which are unique to mycobacteria  <cit> . the functions of some of these are now understood and it is believed that they are important for virulence and antigenic diversity of the pathogen  <cit> . variable patterns of gene expression for these genes during infection have been discussed earlier  <cit> . these set of proteins are involved in the modulation of antigen processing and presentation and thus very successful in evading immune responses. these set of genes have been reported as immune-dominant antigens and are ideal drug targets. about 4% of the shortlisted genes belonged to this functional category.

flux balance analysis
metabolism is a fundamental requirement in an organism to sustain life. flux balance analysis  captures the metabolic state of a system at steady state condition. this is achieved by reconstructing a genome-scale metabolic network  <cit>  and computing the relative fluxes of individual biochemical reactions within the constraints of mass balance and defined stoichiometric coefficients of the network, so as to obtain maximal growth. the method enables systematic perturbations through simulation of kos of individual genes in the model. an essential gene and hence the protein can easily be identified through simulations that lead to zero or reduced growth  <cit> .

genome scale metabolic reconstruction for m.tb h37rv used here consists of  <dig> genes and  <dig> reactions  <cit>  and is referred to as inj <dig>  gene expression values were incorporated into this model to guide the bounds of the individual reaction fluxes. the method of incorporating gene expression values is based on e-flux reported in the literature  <cit> . bounds for each reaction were assigned based on the gene-protein-reaction relationships  provided with the model. integrating expression data into fba makes the network much more biologically realistic, since dynamics of a metabolic network would also depend on the protein concentrations available for the reaction to occur. fluxes are calculated through each reaction so as to maximise the biomass function. the objective value obtained for the original model was  <dig>  hr- <dig>  while for the modified model it was  <dig>  hr- <dig>  around  <dig> - 47% non-zero flux reactions were obtained in both the cases. single gene deletions were performed by systematically deleting each gene in the model and calculating the optimal fluxes using the same biomass function. the ratio of the objective value of the ko and wt  was calculated and plotted for the original and the modified model. the value of grratio determines the importance of a particular gene for the growth of the organism and hence can be used to predict essentiality.

in the original model that did not consider expression data, kos of  <dig> genes affected the optimal objective function, out of which  <dig> were lethal and the remaining showed transitional effect. by adding microarray data, the result did not change much, except for an increase in the number of genes affecting the objective function. a total of  <dig> genes were affected, with  <dig> lethal kos and the rest showing reduced growth as compared to the wild type .

inj <dig> and gsmn-tb  <cit>  are two metabolic networks reported almost simultaneously, both sharing a high amount of similarity. besides these, newer models have been developed recently for the same organism with more number of reactions and genes. one such model is inj661v  <cit>  which contains  <dig> genes,  <dig> metabolites, and  <dig>  reactions that incorporates reactions from both inj <dig> and gsmn-tb, and shown to be more sensitive towards predicting essentiality. the objective value obtained for the model was  <dig>  hr- <dig>  with  <dig> % of the reactions showing non-zero fluxes. therefore, in addition to inj <dig> model, inj661v model was also considered for analysis. the method for predicting gene essentiality was similar to the inj <dig> model, and this lead to the addition of  <dig> more genes to the already identified  <dig> genes. the grratio for ko simulations for this model is shown in figure 2b and a comparison of the impact of gene deletions in the two models is shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig> 

the genes obtained were further classified into functional groups using the scheme provided in jamshidi et al. <cit> . as seen in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  genes from membrane metabolism  and fatty acid metabolism  were significant, reiterating the importance of lipid metabolism and cell wall synthesis in m.tb. purine metabolism  and redox metabolism  also contribute significantly to this set of genes.

apart from the single gene deletions, which characterised genes required for the survival of the organism, double gene deletions were also performed to look for pairs of genes which when knocked out simultaneously are lethal or unfavourable to the organism.  <dig> such gene pairs  were obtained and could serve as potential drug targets. additional file 4: figure s <dig> gives the pathway classification of the genes identified from double ko analysis. in this case, genes belonging to fatty acid metabolism  account for higher contribution, followed by citric acid cycle pathway  and purine metabolism  while glutamate metabolism and glycine, serine, threonine metabolism account for 7% of the total list. about 6% of genes are involved in redox metabolism and 5% of genes contributed to pyruvate metabolism and transport respectively.

from this analysis,  <dig> genes  which showed lethal or unfavourable growth on performing single gene deletions for the gene expression integrated models were selected as candidate essential genes . the hypergeometric test was performed to establish the significance of the subset of genes identified as essential from all the genes analysed using fba. the genes identified as essential through this approach were later categorised into different functional classes based on the schema provided by palsson and co-workers  <cit> .

network analysis
protein–protein interaction networks are known to capture global as well as the local behaviour of a system, despite having the limitation of being static in nature. this can be resolved to some extent by integrating gene expression data into the network and then deriving various insights through calculation of network properties  <cit> . shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a network serve as useful pointers to understand the overall topology of the network and the extent of interaction between the nodes  <cit> . adding weights based on expression level of a node leads to construction of response networks and hence identification of biologically significant paths  <cit> .

an extensively curated, weighted and directed protein–protein interaction network was generated using standards described in the methods section. it consisted of a total of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges . this was a high confidence network and an interaction was included only if sufficient evidence was available for that interaction in literature and databases. to make the network more biologically significant, microarray data was integrated into the network as node weights. each edge was assigned a weight that was a function of the betweenness centrality of that edge and the node weights connecting that edge . shortest paths were exploited to study the importance of each protein by performing systematic kos in the network. importance of a gene or protein is then simply a measure of the number of shortest paths disrupted upon knockout of that node in the network. number of disrupted paths also indicates whether a given protein causes a global disruption to the network or whether it brings about a local effect.

for each ko performed, the number of completely broken paths as well as the number of paths perturbed as a result of increased path cost was calculated. a path cost is taken as the summation of the edge weights defining that path. perturbed paths are indicative of the alternate paths that emerge as a result of that ko and invariably have a higher path cost as compared to the wt. an example of this is illustrated in figure  <dig>  figure 3b demonstrates an example of the shortest path between rv3441c  and rv <dig>  in a wt network. this path includes genes rv3436c  and rv <dig>  and has path cost equal to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  all the four genes are involved in cellular metabolism according to tuberculist  <cit>  and kegg  <cit>  annotations. detailed list of annotations are provided in additional file 7: table s <dig>  upon ko of rv3436c , the simulation indicates that the next best theoretically possible path , is much longer than the original path and also has a higher path cost,  <dig>  × 10- <dig> which is about  <dig> times higher than the wt path cost. such a significant increase in the path cost indicates that this alternate path may be biologically infeasible and thus the node rv3436c would be essential to maintain original function. the perturbed path comprise  <dig> nodes  → rv1151c → rv <dig>  → rv2495c  → rv2496c  → rv <dig>  → rv3457c  → rv <dig>  → rv <dig>  → rv2347c  → rv2346c  → rv2498c  → rv <dig> ), including the source and destination.

broken path analysis was performed to study the effect of gene deletion on the network. systematic knockout was performed to obtain percentage disruption by each gene. a total of  <dig> genes  when knocked out showed broken paths in the network. to obtain the significance of these kos p-values were calculated using random networks. generation of random network is described in the methods section. it was observed that for a majority of the  <dig> genes, the p-values were <  <dig> , while few were in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . the percentage disruption of each of these  <dig> genes, as calculated by equation  <dig> in the methods section, is plotted in figure  <dig>  and the gene indexes are sorted by p-value on the x-axis. it is also noted that the number of paths perturbed for each ko may not necessarily correlate linearly with an increase in total path cost for that ko. this is quite understandable since the impact of perturbation of different paths is not uniform. to capture the relative importance of a perturbation due to a ko, we have ranked nodes based on number of paths perturbed. some kos are seen to cause as much as 34% disruption in the network. such nodes are considered to be critical control points in the network. a significant portion  of these belongs to the functional category of intermediary metabolism and respiration.

phylogenetic analysis
conservation of a protein across species can also broadly imply essentiality as they have been retained through evolution. blast  <cit>  searches were performed for all the m.tb h37rv sequences against a genus-specific dataset of  <dig> species, representing a set of evolutionarily related organisms. the dataset was prepared by considering all mycobacterium species, whose whole genome sequences were available, excluding all the m.tb strains. thus, this dataset includes species that are pathogenic, non-pathogenic, fast and slow growers as well as those pathogenic to non-human hosts. sequences with identity ≥ 30% with sequence coverage ≥ 70% and e-value of ≤  <dig> , with respect to the query protein were chosen for studying essentiality.

proteins showing high phyletic retention were shortlisted. quantitatively, a score was assigned to each protein based on equation  <dig>  explained in the methods section. those with a score ≥  <dig> were selected to be essential, which in turn implied that the gene is conserved in at least 50% of the species in the mycobacterial genus.  <dig> sequences were thus identified and are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

a functional classification of this set was also performed based on tuberculist classification scheme  and it is observed that large number of genes belong to intermediary metabolism and respiration , conserved hypotheticals , cell wall and cell processes  and lipid metabolism .

deriving the final list of essential genes  and comparison with experimental datasets
different methods in this study capture gene essentiality with different perspectives as illustrated in figure  <dig>  fba provides information based on metabolite flow, while phylogenetic analysis captures essentiality based on evolutionary conservation. topological networks provide an overview of connectedness among various proteins while microarrays add quantitative information about the relative abundances of different genes. integrating them together will enable us to address essentiality from all these perspectives simultaneously. towards this, set theory was applied as follows:

  eg=f∩n∪f∩p∪p∩n∩m 

where,

eg = essential genes,

f = genes identified using gene expression integrated fba,

n = genes identified using network,

p = genes identified using phyletic retention,

m = genes identified using microarray,

the boolean logic  selects those genes that were predicted as essential by at least two of the three methods  in addition to the necessary condition of consistent expression pattern. the rule considers expression data as an essential but not a sufficient condition to predict essentiality. if a gene is considered essential, it is important that it expresses sufficiently and consistently. a final set of  <dig> genes were identified using equation  <dig> and is provided in additional file 9: table s <dig> 

an earlier study had experimentally identified a set of  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> were considered as essential while  <dig> more were found to disrupt the growth of the organism using transposon site hybridization method  <cit> . the same group has subsequently used high density mutagenesis and deep sequencing methods to identify a set of  <dig> genes  as essential  <cit> . the latter is reported to be a more sensitive method and apart from identifying those reported by the former approach, it adds many new ones. a recent study by zhang et al. <cit> , that identified essential genes by dividing the whole-genome sequence into windows of different length and studied essentiality by performing trash analysis have also become available. thus, the set of  <dig> genes obtained from our study is compared to these datasets, from which we observe an agreement for  <dig> genes. a few other datasets of experimentally identified egs under different conditions or using different approaches are also available  <cit> . from these, an agreement is observed for another  <dig> genes. put together, the agreement with our analysis is around  <dig> %. it must be noted that the experimental approaches too have their limitations and fail to capture essentiality in some situations. despite these limitations, it is encouraging to observe a high correlation with these datasets.

functional classification of the identified  <dig> genes was carried out using the tuberculist scheme and is shown in figure 6a. about 69%  belonged to metabolic pathways while 12%  and 10%  was obtained for lipid metabolism and cell wall processes respectively, accounting for the importance of these classes. the values in parentheses reflect the percentage of these functional classes in the whole genome. increase in percentage for metabolic pathways and lipid metabolism highlight the essentiality of these pathways. proteins involved in metabolic pathways were further analysed using the scheme provided in jamshidi et al. <cit> , to obtain a finer classification. based on this  four major classes emerged, amino acid biosynthesis pathways , glycolysis , purine metabolism  and redox metabolism . the importance of these pathways for maintaining active metabolism in a cell has been well understood through various biochemical studies  <cit> . indeed proteins belonging to these pathways have been reported to be essential in other organisms as well  <cit> .

to understand the functional roles of the  <dig> set of essential genes, they were viewed in context of the protein-protein interaction network used in this study . of the  <dig> edges present in the network,  <dig> edges are contributed by essential genes where both nodes contributing to an edge are essential as predicted by equation  <dig>  it is interesting to note that although these  <dig> edges form only  <dig> % of all connections in the network, many of them form a connected sub-network by themselves. each edge in the network indicates either a binding interaction or a functional linkage or both between a pair of proteins. the set of essential genes along with their inter-connections shown in figure  <dig> can be regarded to form a core component of the cellular network, essential for that organism.

sequence and structural analysis
biological function to any essential protein is imparted by its amino acid sequence and structure. strong interdependence exists between protein essentiality, its function and the corresponding sequence and structural details of the protein. therefore, an in-depth residue and structural level analysis is carried out for the final list of  <dig> proteins to obtain structural and sequence level insights that impart function and hence essentiality to the protein product of the gene.

residue level conservation
certain residues in a protein are highly conserved across species. such residues are conventionally taken to be functionally or structurally important for the protein  <cit> . using multiple sequence alignments obtained from clustalw  <cit> , residue-wise conservation scores were calculated for each protein using a home-grown algorithm  <cit> , as described in the methods section. this was carried out for each of the  <dig> proteins identified as essential. sequence conservation analysis was obtained for  <dig> proteins, while structural analysis was obtained for  <dig> proteins, based on the availability of structural models. figure  <dig> illustrates the nature of the analysis for these  <dig> proteins, by taking an example of rv3436c , a glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase. in each protein, the set of residues with a conservation score of ≥ 50% were considered for structural analysis.

figure  <dig>  shows the frequency distribution of the essential genes based on the percentage of residues conserved. as can be seen from the figure, more than 85% of the egs have  <dig> – 100% residues conserved. individual multiple sequence alignments in which conserved residues are highlighted are made available at http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/mtbessentialgenes.

structural analysis
binding sites in a protein structure are important for the function of the protein. residues in a binding site are usually conserved and have functional importance attached to them. using algorithms previously developed in the laboratory  <cit>  binding sites were identified in the structural models for the set of egs identified here. the models were obtained from m.tb structural proteome database, available in the laboratory  <cit> . structural models were available for  <dig> of the  <dig> identified egs, in which a total of  <dig> binding pockets were identified. the conserved residues identified from sequence conservation analysis were mapped on the binding sites or pockets. figure 8c shows an example of binding pockets for rv3436c and mapping of the conserved residues on it.

from this analysis, it was observed that all the  <dig> proteins had at least some conserved residues in their binding sites, amounting to  <dig> of the  <dig> sites studied. the binding sites were selected based on a consensus method that considered geometry, conservation as well as energy based cut-offs. this ensures that the identified pockets have sufficient volume and geometry to recognize a meaningful biological ligand. figure  <dig> shows that more than 70% of the binding sites contain conserved residues. considering the fact, that the set of sites studied includes crystallographically known binding sites as well as consensus site predictions, the extent of conservation is remarkable indeed. this was also verified statistically by calculating the quantile variation of conservation scores in the protein as a whole as compared to the binding sites alone in each case. the conservation of residues in the binding sites was significantly higher than for other regions in the protein . the p-value was calculated between the conservation score distribution of the residues in the whole protein and that at the binding sites. identification of these sites also provides a list of important residues and hence important interactions for the function of that protein. our definition of essentiality implies that a given gene is essential if it has an essential function, which is conserved across other members in its close ecological niche. this means that the functional site residues that impart a function to a protein ought to be closely conserved. hence the set of conserved residues in conserved pockets in the set of egs indicate a basis for the conservation of function and hence for the essentiality of that protein.

discussion
the complexity of living organisms can be probed by understanding which genes play an essential role for the growth and survival and which are conditionally essential. essentiality is studied here at multiple levels, at the levels of modules in the topological network of protein-protein interactions, at the pathway level by identifying essential metabolic, regulatory and signalling pathways, at the genome level, first by identifying high expression in multiple arrays of the same condition and second, by selecting genes that are evolutionarily conserved.

consistent expression at a genome-scale level is used for weighting both the genome-scale metabolic network as well as the topological interactome, making the models resemble the actual experimental parameters more closely. an often asked question is whether gene expression levels can be used to understand protein abundance. while, gene expression may not always translate to corresponding protein abundances, there are many studies which show significant correlation between gene expression and protein abundances  <cit> . in any case, given the paucity of proteome-wide protein abundance data, this issue is difficult to address. in this study, we have tried to resolve this issue by considering multiple transcriptome profiles of essentially the same condition, simply to augment confidence levels. this is based on the premise that if a gene is consistently expressed across multiple profiles, it is unlikely to vary significantly in that condition and hence can be expected to correlate reasonably well with protein abundance. it should however be noted that focussing only on consistently expressed genes may not capture all genes that are essential for the organism, but in a systematic genome-scale study such as this, the decision has been to minimise false positives, with the belief that the subset of genes identified as essential should be of high confidence even if a few genes are missed out.

two different types of systems approaches are used here, the interactome architecture analysis and the flux balance analysis of the genome-scale metabolic model, both integrating functional genomics data in terms of expression levels. the topological analysis utilizing graph theoretical methods of a weighted directed network explore the inherent organization of the connectedness of the individual molecular players in the cell and provide a basis to understand dynamics and the flow of chemical information using those connections. these approaches provide insights into the emergent properties arising in the system as a whole comprising specific interactions among the large number of components in a cell.

four different computational approaches, each capturing a different piece of information are utilized in this study. the results from each are then compared to the three different experimental datasets available in literature. table  <dig> provides the agreements between different pairs of methods and also among their combinations. the second and third column of table  <dig> represent the coverage of each method. comparison between individual methods is provided as a matrix in the same table . rows 8- <dig> represents the comparison of individual methods with the three different boolean logics used  as well as integrated approach. the values which are bold and italicized indicate the comparison between the experimental and theoretical methods. . please note that conditional essentiality has not been mapped in this table.

the table indicates comparison between different experimental and theoretical methods used for the study.

the three experimentally determined methods have identified  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  egs. it must be noted that the set of egs common to them are only  <dig>  which corresponds to a commonality of only 47%, indicating lacunae with the experimental methods as well. nevertheless for lack of any other comprehensive data, union of the egs from these three methods, amounting to  <dig> egs are used for comparison with the predictions made in this study. the accuracies observed with individual methods are,  <dig> % for phyletic retention analysis, 73% with fba,  <dig> % for gene expression and  <dig> % with network analysis.

various combinations of other boolean operators were also implemented as shown in additional file 10: figure s <dig>  when an intersection of positively identified proteins from all methods  was considered, only  <dig> egs  could be identified as essential. of these,  <dig> were found to be essential in the experimental datasets, while  <dig> of them were identified as essential under specific conditions, resulting in an accuracy of about  <dig> %.

  eg=f∩p∩n∩m 

keeping in mind that the fba model contained only a small set of genes , all belonging to metabolic class, an alternate boolean logic was also implemented using only phylogenetic analysis, networks and microarray so as to remove the bias on metabolic genes caused by including fba in the calculation and is described below,

  eg=p∩n∩m 

 <dig> genes were identified by this method and are listed in additional file 11: table s <dig>  this set showed 60% correlation with experimental dataset. overall, on comparing egs identified by the different boolean logics, equation  <dig> described in the results, fares better as it a) has higher coverage as compared to equation  <dig> and b) it is indeed not skewed towards any one method as seen from the analysis of equation  <dig>  finally, the  <dig> egs derived from equation  <dig> were chosen as the final list from this study, which had an overall accuracy of  <dig> %.

a detailed comparison of these boolean logics with individual methods is also provided in table  <dig>  it is clear from the table that integrating different approaches into a meta-prediction yields better prediction capabilities than any of the individual methods. thus the meta-prediction demonstrates the usefulness of combining systems architecture, metabolic dynamics and evolutionary insights along with gene expression. it is also interesting to note that some of the genes that are identified as essential from double knockout analysis using fba, appear in the final list of egs, as these were identified by phylogenetic and network analysis.

further, as a way of removing reliance on any cut-off by any method, all  <dig> genes in the genome were assigned a score based on an integrated scoring scheme  devised to quantify the results obtained from different approaches to infer essentiality.  <dig> genes as obtained from the integrated score correspond to the top 50th percentile were also compared with individual experimental and theoretical method and is listed in table  <dig>  the highest confidence set of  <dig> egs from equation  <dig> were indeed the top  <dig> ranks based on the integrated score. moreover, the final list of  <dig> genes identified by boolean logic  <dig>  were also observed to have high ranks in this list, again demonstrating that there was no bias from any one approach.

conditional essentiality has not been explicitly addressed in this study since the main focus was to identify those that are consistently essential in the wt condition. the same framework and techniques with small modifications can however be utilized, to probe condition-specific essentiality, when sufficient data becomes available. yet, it is interesting to note that some of the egs identified here are reported in literature to be conditionally essential genes based on individual experimental studies .

the final list of  <dig> genes was further compared to an earlier study by raman et al. <cit>  that identified drug targets for m.tb based on an integrated pipeline approach. it is observed that about  <dig> % of the essential genes identified in this study can also be used as drug targets for the pathogen. the subset of genes in m.tb belonging to fatty acid metabolism, purine metabolism, amino acid metabolism and redox metabolism are seen to dominate the list of essential genes.

some of the genes belonging to the pe/ppe class are reported to be essential for m.tb h37rv  <cit> . in this study, genes from this class were identified as essential from microarray analysis; however these were not identified by other methods. this is because, i ) fba studies genes belonging to metabolic pathways only, ii) these class of genes are not evolutionarily conserved across the species and iii) no high confidence interaction data was available for these genes and thus was not included in the network. as a result, these genes were filtered out on applying the boolean logic.

extensive lists of essential genes identified using experimental whole-genome approaches are available in literature for several organisms such as staphylococcus aureus <cit> , helicobacter pylori <cit> , mycoplasma genitalium <cit> , and pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> . there are reports of such lists identified through computational approaches as well  <cit> . such studies have primarily involved phylogenetic comparisons  <cit> . there are also a few reports recently, where flux balance analysis and related methods are used to study essential genes and reactions in metabolic networks  <cit> . however, apart from studies such as  <cit> , there have not been sufficient efforts in the direction of integrated studies to infer essentiality. this study bridges perspective from several levels by considering the set of genes that are required for maintaining interactome integrity, maintaining metabolism and enabling growth as well as conservation through evolution of various organisms in the genus.

the set of genes identified have been probed further to predict amino acid residues that are important for the function of the gene product again by utilizing evolutionary information at a finer scale and integrating with the three dimensional structural information of protein molecules combined with the functional information of ligand binding pockets. the methodology used here can serve as a generic framework for identifying essential gene lists in other pathogens as well. the set of genes identified have the potential to be applied in drug discovery, taking target identification to a much more rational and wholistic level.

CONCLUSIONS
a robust methodology to identify essential genes in mycobacterium tuberculosis has been developed that integrates data obtained from different levels of abstraction. towards this, microarray data has been used for essential gene prediction, knockout analysis using fba to identify essential genes from metabolic networks, phylogenetic analysis to identify evolutionarily conserved genes and systematic knockout analysis of protein-protein interaction network has been performed. the results are validated using experimental datasets. structural analysis of the proteins of the predicted essential genes is further analysed at the sequence and structural level to provide a basis for essentiality. overall, the method recognises the importance of a multi–scale analysis and provides a framework for prediction of essential genes.
