BACKGROUND
according to the report of fao, us $ <dig> billion losses worldwide were caused by 20–40% decrease in crop yield, due to the attack from pathogenic organisms and insect pests  <cit> . helicoverpa armigera and spodoptera litura are the major polyphagous pests attacking more than  <dig> different host species and affect the vegetable yield  <cit> . therefore these pests are considered as the most economically important insect pests in many countries including india, japan, china and southeast asia. controlling these polyphagous pests becomes the challenging work in agriculture field. there are few chemical insecticides and pesticides are commercially available in the market. usage of different varieties of chemical insecticides and pesticides to control insects has resulted in emergence of pesticide resistance in the pests  <cit> . to ensure the stable and high output of crops, huge amount of pesticides were applied to control the pests, and this not only caused serious environmental pollution but also induced in a wide range of pesticide resistance. meanwhile by applying these chemical pesticides different varieties of pest predators were killed and the ecological balance was destroyed, thereby causing pest resurgence and a greater outbreak of secondary pests  <cit> . due to this reason, many researchers have involved on alternative control methods. botanical and microbial pesticides are having advantage over chemical pesticides by its highly effective, safe, and ecologically acceptable nature. fortunately, bio-pesticides have been gaining increased attention and interest among those concerned with developing environment friendly and safe integrated crop management, with compatible approaches and tactics for pest management  <cit> .

natural products derived from plants and microorganisms have been used for insect control  <cit> . azadirachtin, a natural compound isolated from neem azadirachta indica, is considered superior over other compounds since it has wide range of biological activities. azadirachtin has been studied by many researchers and used as positive control. bacterial and viral-based insecticides controlled different pests. most of the pesticides from microorganisms have been isolated from entomo-pathogens and the terrestrial environment  <cit> . recent studies on marine microorganisms have focused mainly on the discovery of human drugs, whereas limited information about marine microorganisms possessing insecticidal activities has been reported. however marine environment, representing more than two thirds of our planet, is still under-explored and is considered to be a prolific resource for the isolation of less exploited microorganisms  <cit> . the ocean is a resource of huge drug, where more than  <dig> kinds of novel chemical compounds have been isolated from marine living organisms, among which more than  <dig> compounds exert biological activities, such as anti-tumour, anti-microbial and anti-virus, etc.  <cit> .

recently, streptomyces sp. ap- <dig> producing polyketide metabolite  was reported by analyzing the presence of polyketide biosynthesis  biosynthetic cluster  <cit> . streptomyces sp. ap- <dig>  a gram positive, filamentous, spore-forming antagonistic bacteria recovered from marine region at andhra pradesh, india. polyketide metabolite isolated from streptomyces sp. ap- <dig> acted as a growth inhibitor of gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria and filamentous fungi. no reports are available on the effect of polyketide metabolite against the polyphagous pest h. armigera and s. litura. the present study was aimed at assessing the antifeedant, larvicidal, pupicidal and growth inhibitory effect of polyketide metabolite isolated from streptomyces sp. ap- <dig> against h. armigera and s. litura .

RESULTS
in the present study, polyketide metabolite derived from streptomyces sp. ap- <dig> revealed strong antifeedant activity of  <dig> % and  <dig> % against h. armigera and s. litura, respectively at  <dig> ppm concentration and the activity was statistically significant over control  . the bioactivity was directly proportional to the concentration of the metabolite. polyketide metabolite showed  <dig> % and  <dig> % larvicidal activities against h. armigera and s. litura, respectively at  <dig> ppm and the activity was statistically significant compared to control  . the metabolite exhibit marked toxicity effect on the larvae of h. armigera and s. litura. the larvae which had consumed less amount of treated diet showed higher amount of larval mortality. the lc <dig> and lc <dig> values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm and  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm for h. armigera and s. litura, respectively.

table  <dig> shows pupicidal activity of polyketide metabolite consumed larvae of h. armigera and s. litura, respectively. after treatment with polyketide metabolite the larval and pupal developmental periods were increased significantly. the interference of toxic substances in the moulting process triggers the larval duration. due to the treatment of the compound; larvae become small in size and various kinds of abnormalities were observed, therefore the larvae were not able to go into further instars. the larvae were unable to continue normal physiological processes since the larvae consumed very low amount of diet. moulting was also delayed. larval developmental period was increased in treatment  when compared to control  for h. armigera and s. litura, respectively. pupal duration was also increased in treatment  when compared to control  for h. armigera and s. litura, respectively. the metabolite showed pupicidal activities of  <dig> % and  <dig> % against h. armigera and s. litura, respectively at  <dig> ppm concentration . pupicidal activities were statistically significant with increasing concentrations of the compound. in general, prolonged larval–pupal durations were directly proportional to the increase in pupicidal activities. treatment produced different kinds of abnormalities such as larval–pupal, pupal–adult intermediate and adult abnormalities were also observed.
