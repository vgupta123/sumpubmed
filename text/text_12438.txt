BACKGROUND
we present the complete genome sequence and analysis of a novel serratia species that, in conjunction with the nematode caenorhabditis briggsae, forms a putative entomopathogenic association lethal to galleria mellonella larvae  <cit> . this serratia species was isolated from c. briggsae nematodes recovered from three separate galleria traps baited in soil in the kawa zulu natal province in south africa and resembles the other entomopathogenic nematode  associations. epns are mutualistic associations between a bacterium and a nematode that enables them to kill insects and benefit both partners with nutrients and breeding sites  <cit> . although all three players in the epn life cycle - pathogenic bacteria, nematode and host insect larvae – are ancient and abundant taxa in nature, only two independently evolved entomopathogenic partnerships are well studied. one is the association between bacteria in the genus photorhabdus and heterorhabditid nematodes  <cit>  and the other is the association between bacteria in the genus xenorhabdus with steinernematid nematodes  <cit> . epn associations involve complex interactions between the pathogens and the nematode worms. in typical epn associations the nematode is responsible for locating suitable host, penetrating the host insect and releasing the bacteria into the hemocoel while the bacteria are responsible for killing the host, bioconversion of complex compounds and protection of the insect cadaver from scavenging competitors thus ensuring nutrition for itself and its nematode partner  <cit> .

significant bacterial adaptations to the epn lifestyle include the regulation of the switch between mutualism and pathogenicity, accelerated insect killing, cadaver bioconversion, and re-association with infective juveniles  <cit> . recent studies have revealed that in both canonical epn bacterial species l-proline in the insect hemolymph is the main trigger that initiates a metabolic shift from a quasi-dormant state in the nematode gut to a dramatic increase in secondary metabolite production in the insect hemocoel  <cit> . following this l-proline-induced metabolic shift, major regulatory events take place. in the photorhabdus/heterorhabdus association, two global regulators, hexa  <cit>  and ner  <cit> , control the switch between mutualism and pathogenesis, while the phop/phoq and the asts/astr two-component systems  <cit>  and the pgbpe operon  <cit>  regulate pathogenicity and mutualism genes. furthermore, heterorhabditid nematodes fail to grow and reproduce normally when grown with photorhabdus mutants defective in ngra, suggesting that its phosphopantetheinyl  transferase product is required for nematode growth and reproduction  <cit> . finally, the reassociation of infective juveniles and their cognate bacteria as well as the retention of the bacteria in the nematode gut seems to be mediated by the expression of adhesion fimbriae encoded in one of the many genomic islands rich in phage remnants  <cit> . by comparison, in the xenorhabdus/steinernema association, a similar, but non-homologous, mechanism operates in which the global regulator lrp and the two component system cpxra and the lysr regulator lrha  <cit>  orchestrate all three major stages of the life cycle: infection, reproduction and transmission. whereas many compounds are implicated in insect killing and sanitization of the insect cadaver  <cit>  transmission in x. nematophila seems to require the nilabc operon which encodes three surface-localized colonization factors whose mutations invariantly lead to defective recolonization of steinernematid worms by x. nematophila bacteria  <cit> . the absence of the nilabc genes in x. bovienii and in photorhabdus species suggest that bacteria-nematode recolonization is realized by different mechanisms in these two well-studied epn systems. to summarize, the genetic mechanisms by which photorhabdus and xenorhabdus achieve entomopathogenicity are quite distinct and evidence of independent evolution of a similar phenotype.

the bacterium we describe here, serratia sp. scbi, belongs to the genus serratia that consists of several species with diverse lifestyles that include free soil dwellers  <cit> , plant associates in the rhizosphere  <cit> , opportunistic pathogens  <cit>  and obligate intracellular endosymbionts  <cit> . most serratia spp. secrete an array of active extracellular enzymes such as nucleases, proteases  <cit> , lipases  <cit>  and hemolysin and have swarming and swimming mobility  <cit> . these features may enable them to colonize a wide variety of niches and contribute to their success as opportunistic pathogens. of the sequenced serratia spp., the closest species to our isolate, s. marcescens db <dig>  is a confirmed pathogen of invertebrates  <cit> , a function that is likely required for evolution of an epn complex.

although serratia sp. scbi was initially isolated as an associate of caenorhabditis briggsae, this bacterium will also associate with strains of the well-studied model eukaryote caenorhabditis elegans and allow these bacteriovorus nematodes to kill insects  <cit> . both c. briggsae and c. elegans are well known associates of invertebrates  <cit> , a likely pre-adaptation to an epn life cycle. recent discoveries of serratia spp. in epn associations  <cit>  suggest the possibility that serratia sp. scbi may belong to a unique lineage within the genus serratia that has evolved the capacity to confer an epn lifestyle to diverse insect-associated nematodes. the serratia sp. scbi and caenorhabditid epn complex represents a unique opportunity to explore the evolution of symbiosis in a third epn lineage. here we present the complete genome sequence of serratia sp. scbi and explore how it is unique with respect to other closely related serratia and how the predicted functional proteome compares to features found in the well-studied epn-associated bacteria, xenorhabdus and photorhabdus.

phylogenetic placement of scbi
to place serratia sp. scbi in an evolutionary framework we compared the near complete 16s rrna genes from diverse serratia species and other relevant entomopathogenic bacteria  as well as concatenated sequences from four housekeeping genes: atpd, gyrb, ifnb and rpob. the phylogenetic tree from the concatenated housekeeping genes suggest that serratia sp. scbi is found in a clade of five serratia which are all known insect associates and scbi was closest to s. ureilytica. among the well-studied and completely sequenced species included in the 16s phylogeny, serratia sp. scbi was most closely related to s. marcescens db <dig>  which is an insect pathogen  <cit>  and antagonist of c. elegans  <cit> . this close relationship provides an ideal opportunity to identify candidate genes critical to the evolution of the epn lifestyle. another closely related species is s. nematodiphila, which was described as part of an epn association with a rhabditid nematode  <cit> . other close relatives include s. entomophila  <cit> , which is pathogenic to new zealand grass grubs, and s. ureilytica which is a nickel resistant serratia isolated from the river torsa in west bengal, india  <cit> . this phylogeny suggests that serratia sp. scbi may represent a novel, independently evolving epn association from within a lineage of serratia commonly associated with insects.

genomic alignment and comparative genomic analysis
whole genome alignment of scbi with three of the sequenced serratia genomes show extensive synteny  where large colinear blocks of genes are interrupted by insertions that resulted in genomic islands, deletions relative to scbi and a small number of rearrangements involving relatively small genomic regions. in the context of this study, a genomic island  was broadly defined as any stretch of five or more consecutive protein coding genes that: 1) are not present in the other members of the genus, and 2) show a divergent %gc content compared to the core genome. our analysis predicts at least  <dig> gis in serratia sp. scbi. based on these criteria  <dig> of  <dig>  of unique genes are located in the genomic islands of scbi and as discussed below most of these gis encode functions of potential biological relevance to the epn lifestyle . to ascertain the significance of the serratia sp. scbi-c. briggsae association in relation to other serratia and the established epn bacteria, we conducted comparative analysis of the predicted proteome against the respective groups using the mauve  <cit>  genome alignment tool. the cutoff values of 60 % identity and 70 % coverage, i.e. similarity of 60 % of the compared residues covering 70 % of the total length of the shorter sequence in the comparison, were used to include only hits with high confidence levels and exclude spurious hits .fig.  <dig> genomic alignment of the four compared serratia spp. alignment statistics were generated and rendered by mauve progressive alignment software  <cit> . smar: s. marcescens db <dig>  scbi: serratia sp. scbi, and spro: s. proteamaculans <dig>  sas12: serratia sp. as <dig>  color schemes represent blocks of contiguous genes interrupted by colorless patches where the genomes differ from each other significantly and identified as gis are located

cog analysis among serratia
analysis of the functional categories and genome wide distribution of all unique genes with assigned clusters of orthologous groups  functions among the sequenced serratia genomes revealed that the unique genes in serratia sp. scbi were biased towards categories that have direct bearing on the symbiosis and/or pathogenesis life style . specifically, the gains were in cog categories: - cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; - cell motility; - secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism;  - intracellular trafficking and secretion and - defense mechanisms.fig.  <dig> relative cog category abundance in the core proteome in comparison with unique proteins in serratia. the relative abundance of cog categories between the core and unique gene pools was calculated as follows: the number of proteins in each cog category was determined and the unique pools normalized to their respective total predicted protein numbers. then the percentage of each cog category in the core proteome was subtracted from the corresponding cog percentage in the unique category and the difference plotted. cog functional categories descriptions are:  rna processing and modification;  chromatin structure and dynamics;  energy production and conversion;  cell cycle control and mitosis;  amino acid metabolism and transport;  nucleotide metabolism and transport;  carbohydrate metabolism and transport;  coenzyme metabolism;  lipid metabolism;  translation;  transcription;  replication and repair;  cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis;  cell motility;  post-translational modification] protein turnover] chaperone functions;  inorganic ion transport and metabolism;  secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism;  signal transduction;  intracellular trafficking and secretion;  general functional prediction only ;  function unknown;  defense mechanisms.  no cog category



functional properties of serratia sp. scbi shared with other entomopathogens
to evaluate the serratia sp. scbi in the context of its role in an epn complex, we searched the scbi genome for homologs or functional analogs of all genes previously shown or implicated to be involved in host immune defense, host killing and cadaver protection, pathogenesis and symbiosis and reassociation in the canonical epn species xenorhabdus and photorhabdus . although most of these genes appear in gis in serratia scbi, we focused the comparison on three functions with well documented roles in epn lifestyle but not confined to putative genomic islands: evading host defense, toxicity to host and competitors and recolonization. functional studies on the serratia sp. scbi-c. elegans complex has shown that hemolysin, nrps proteins  and extracellular proteases are crucial to cytotoxicity and virulence in this putative epn symbiosis  <cit> . the dynamics of mrna expression of the alkaline metalloproteases  compared to the serine metalloproteases which peak before and after the death of the host, respectively, suggest a complex regulatory mechanism in killing the host and bioconversion of the cadaver  <cit> . furthermore, inactivation of the hemolysin gene in serratia sp. scbi, which resulted in loss of hemolysis, failed to attenuate insecticidal activity but significantly increased motility and antimicrobial activity . furthermore comparative study on the physiology of three sequenced strains, serratia sp. scbi, s. marcescens db <dig> and s. proteamaculans  <dig>  revealed that db <dig> and scbi were similar in insect virulence and cytotoxicity consistent with their phylogenetic proximity, but motility and lipase and hemolytic activities differed significantly between them  <cit> . the implication of these functional studies is that the serratia sp. scbi-c. briggsae association is a promising model to study the dynamics of gene expression during the transition from starved, inactive stay in nematode gut to active state during pathogenesis –killing and bioconversion– of insect hosts.

breaching host defense
breaching the insect host’s defense –both the humoral and cellular components- is crucial for the establishment of infection. epns neutralize humoral response elements like lysozyme and cecropins with serralysin-like proteases such as the prta  <cit>  and by haemolysins  and lipases  and the fhldc regulator operon  <cit> . cellular response evasion is directed mainly at suppressing the phenoloxidase pathway to prevent hemocyte aggregation and melanization. several mechanisms are employed to suppress the insects’ cellular immune response. these include: inhibition of phospholipase a <dig>  using stilbene and malpqt operon products in photorhabdus and expression of lps in xenorhabdus, the suppression of phagocytosis by type iii secretion system-mediated deposition of lopt and sctc directly into hemocytes  <cit>  and the production of cytotoxins such as cif and mrxa that lead to apoptotic cell death. with the exception of the xlpa gene which is absent from serratia spp. and the cif and stc genes that are absent not only from serratia spp. but also from xenorhabdus spp., all other genes identifies as instrumental in the toxicity of epns are present in serratia spp. as well including scbi. the presence of more serralysins in serratia spp., by comparison to the epn genomes, suggests that the scbi c. briggsae association may heavily rely on the expression of multiple serralysin genes and extracellular lipases and hemolysin production to breach the host immune system.

toxicity
toxicity –both for killing the insect host and warding off bacterial and fungal competitors- is mediated by a plethora of insecticidal and bactericidal gene products  <cit> . these include the photorhabdus toxin complex  operons tcaabcd and their counterparts in xenorhabdus xptabcd, as well as other toxicity genes like the pirab, xaxb, sepa, groel, lopt, mcf, mcf <dig>  rtxa, mptbde. various drug efflux systems and numerous nonribosomal peptide synthase  and polyketide synthase  genes  <cit>  are also part of the overall toxicity caused by epn systems. the redundancy evident in the toxin gene repertoire of photorhabdus and xenorhabdus is astounding – at the time of its sequencing in  <dig>  p. luminescens was described as having more genes encoding toxins than any other genome sequenced to date  <cit> , however, serratia sp. scbi also has over  <dig> genes encoding toxins, nrps genes, multiple drug efflux systems and assorted virulence factors.

nematode recolonization
nematode recolonization involves two key elements: acquisition of partner bacteria by horizontal transmission via endotokia matricida  <cit> , in which eggs hatch within the sacrificial mother to gain access to bacteria before emerging from the maternal corpse and the retention of bacteria in the gut of the infective juvenile. the latter seems to be mediated by ngra  <cit> , the type i fimbriae mrxa  <cit>  and at least in x. nematophila, by the products of the nilabc and nilr genes  <cit> . both of these requirements seem to be met in scbi since caenorhabditids, when grown on scbi, almost exclusively reproduce by endotokia matricida  <cit>  and scbi possess homologs of both genes implicated in recolonization. furthermore, the absence of the nilabc genes of x. nematophila in xenorhabdus boveinii as well as photorhabdus spp. show that colonization, like other aspects of epn biology, can be produced by different mechanisms in epns.

from this comparison three patterns emerge: 1) serratia lack homologs of the toxicity genes lopt, rtxa, prta, pirb, cif, mcf, and mcf <dig> and the tc operons but have substantial number of secreted proteases and lipases, and hemolysins and 2) the majority of the photorhabdus/xenorhabdus virulence, symbiosis and regulatory genes are equally represented in serratia , and 3) the presence of key genes is not uniform among the different species –nilabc absent in photorhabdus spp. and cif, stc, cipab and lopt missing from xenorhabdus spp.-suggesting that there is no single possible path to pathogenicity, cadaver bioconversion, repelling of competitors and bacterial re-association.

unique genes and genomic islands  of scbi
apart from those summarized in table  <dig>  many other genes with well-documented pathogenicity/symbiosis functions in other microbial systems are found in the genome of scbi more than half of which are located on genomic islands. of the  <dig> genomic islands identified in serratia sp. scbi genome comparison , many were enriched in defense and virulence genes and in - phage remnants which, in many bacteria including those in epn associations, have been diverted into novel toxin/virulence factor delivery vehicles  <cit> .

perhaps the most notable feature among the genomic islands is the urea pathway genes located on gi- <dig>  the hoxn/hupn/nixa family nickel/cobalt transporter and the urea metabolism pathway proteins found in gi- <dig>  are absent from other members of the genus serratia but interestingly present in all the epn bacteria. the hoxn transporter is necessary for urea hydrolysis  <cit>  making it an integral part of the pathway. while there is no evidence so far of a direct role for urea metabolism in the epn lifestyle, a potential role for these pathways can be exemplified by current research on diatoms where the urea pathway is a key to facilitating rapid recovery from prolonged nitrogen limitation followed by rapid growth under nutrient rich conditions  <cit> . the epn life cycle has a similar pattern in that the symbionts that survive in nutrient-limited conditions while in transit to the next cycle of infection face a sudden abundance of organic compounds upon entering the insect hemocoel, thus requiring rapid transitioning from starved state to exponential growth of the bacteria. furthermore, the regulation of the urea pathway in the diatoms has been linked to proline  <cit>  which has also been identified as the cue for the transition from starved to metabolically active state in photorhabdus and xenorhabdus.

among the unique genes of scbi that are relevant to its association with c. briggsae as a putative epn are the o-antigen biosynthesis protein, nrps proteins, colicins , type iv secretion systems , and iron acquisition proteins. these genes have been shown to be required for both symbiotic and pathogenic properties  <cit>  and may play a similar role in the serratia-caenorhabditis epn association.

the list of genes unique to scbi also include efflux system proteins  that are specific for macrolide- a class of antibiotics that inhibit the growth of bacteria- and the resistance-nodulation- division  efflux proteins  that are known to actively scavenge antimicrobial compounds released by competitors or the host immune system  <cit> , a predicted htpx protease, a heat shock/stress inducible membrane bound zinc metalloprotease  <cit> , the dini family protein also known as msga   and prophage lysozyme proteins  an endolysin/autolysin system known to degrade the peptidoglycan structures in bacterial cell walls  <cit> ; microcin h <dig>  a bactericidal peptide antibiotic related to the colicin v family secretion protein  <cit>  and associated secretion atpase required for its export  <cit> ; several fimbrial proteins with functional annotations ranging from pilus assembly to anchoring which, in light of recent findings that implicate photorhabdus and xenorhabdus adherence to the gut walls of their respective worm associates via fimbrial proteins,  <cit>  and two homologs of the higb toxin protein/higa protein , which in vibrio, have been shown to inhibit cell growth in escherichia coli upon ectopic expression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
epn associations are complex tripartite interactions between bacterial pathogens, symbiotic entomophagous nematodes and susceptible insect/insect larval hosts. thus far our understanding of the mechanisms of epn associations is limited to two superficially similar and convergent systems. here we report the complete genome sequence of the bacterium involved in a novel independently evolving putative epn association between a species of serratia and nematodes in the genus caenorhabditis. this serratia is most closely related to another recently discovered epn association, serratia nematodiphila, and the well-studied insect pathogen serratia marcescens db <dig>  based on a comparison to the two well studies epn systems, the genome of serratia sp. scbi contains a large number of genes that are potential candidates for epn adaptations. among the most notable shared functions with other epn associates are the o-antigen, the syrp protein, several non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, bacteriocins, many fimbrial biogenesis and ushering proteins, secondary metabolite and toxin secretion systems and multiple drug resistance/efflux systems. however, the scbi genome carries neither the tc complexes nor the mcf genes, which implies its use of different mechanisms of insect killing. the presence of several orfs encoding putative virulence factors in horizontally acquired genomic islands suggest that epn associations can be established by dissimilar sets of mechanisms for killing, bioconversion, sanitization and colonization. the presence of these sets of genes in many bacteria further suggests that the major hurdle in epn complex formation may be the initial development of co-tolerance between potential partners. this complete genome sequence of one of the partners in a nascent epn association should enable future analysis of the serratia/caenorhabditis epn complex.
