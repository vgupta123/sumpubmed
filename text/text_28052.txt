BACKGROUND
brucella spp. are intracellular pathogens responsible for a chronic mammalian zoonotic disease, which has emerged as an ongoing public health problem worldwide  <cit> . these organisms cause subtle infections, which entail extensive replication inside host cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and placental trophoblasts, for several days without producing toxic effects  <cit> . the virulence factors used by the brucella spp. to invade and persist are assumed to aid the organism's ability to avoid the killing mechanisms within cells  <cit> , but their molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. in macrophages, brucella may bind to distinct phagocytic receptors, such as fc gamma receptors and scavenger receptors, but may also bind to unknown receptors resulting in subsequent engulfment by zipper-like phagocytosis  <cit> . it has also been shown that brucella invades phagocytes through lipid raft microdomains  <cit> .

platelet-activating factor receptor  is a member of the g protein-coupled receptor superfamily  that is expressed on various cell types, including neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial cells  <cit> . this receptor is activated by its ligand, paf, which is an effective phospholipid mediator with multiple physiological and pathological involvement in allergic disorders and inflammation  <cit> . both pafr and paf may enhance the host ability to manage infections by promoting phagocytosis and eradication of engulfed microorganisms. pafr is engaged during the host response to overcome infections through promoting phagocytosis and the subsequent elimination of internalized pathogens  <cit> .

janus kinase   <dig> is generally known as a key linker of cytokine-mediated signal transduction and modulation of immune responses  <cit> . it has been elucidated that jak <dig> is involved in the activation of src-kinase, pi3k, mapks, and stat downstream signaling following cytokine receptor activation and infection  <cit> . jak <dig> signaling is not a distinctive hallmark of cytokine receptors; however, some evidences support its significance in gpcr signaling with some studies showing that jak <dig> is associated with angiotensin at <dig> receptor  <cit>  and pafr  <cit> .

it has been demonstrated that pafr stimulation activates divergent signaling pathways. whether b. abortus interacts with pafr and what phagocytic mechanisms of b. abortus are associated with pafr-linked signaling have not been defined. here, we address a novel phagocytic mechanism and reveal that pafr facilitates the phagocytosis of b. abortus, and this event is associated with intracellular jak <dig> pathways leading to amplified rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. in correlation with the interaction of b. abortus with pafr-linked jak <dig> signaling, there is evidence that paf production is notably increased by b. abortus infection, which triggers trafficking of pafr from the membrane to the endosomes. taken together, this study suggests that the pafr-linked jak <dig> signaling contributes to the entry of b. abortus into macrophages. these findings highlight an important receptor-mediated signaling pathway involved in the b. abortus phagocytic mechanism.

RESULTS
uptake of b. abortus contributes to paf production by enhancing activation of lpcat <dig> through jak2-mediated pathway
previous studies elucidated the action of pafr on bacterial infections  <cit> , however, an interaction between b. abortus and pafr or its ligand, paf, has not yet been investigated. we first determined whether b. abortus infection induces paf production through activation of pafr. the paf content increased at a high level at 5 min post-infection with b. abortus  compared to resting cells . paf has been reported to stimulate pafr which is associated with jak <dig> signaling  <cit> , and in our previous study, we demonstrated that jak <dig> activation is involved in the invasion pathway of b. abortus  <cit> . consequently, for comprehensive correlation between paf production and b. abortus infection on pafr-mediated signaling pathway, we measured paf content in both cv <dig> -treated and ag <dig> -treated cells during b. abortus uptake. as a result, the levels of paf secretion during b. abortus infection were significantly attenuated in both cv3988- and ag490-treated cells, demonstrating approximately  <dig> -fold reductions. collectively, paf production is enhanced during b. abortus infection through a jak2-mediated pathway. additionally, the paf content was not significantly increased in cells infected with heat-killed b. abortus compared to resting cells or live b. abortus, while in the case of e. coli o157:h <dig> infection, it was remarkably increased  as much as those of live b. abortus.fig.  <dig> production of paf linked to lpcat <dig> activation is enhanced by b. abortus infection.  raw <dig>  cells pretreated with ag <dig>  or cv <dig> , a pafr antagonist, for 1 h were infected with live b. abortus for 5 min. the cells were infected with heat-killed b. abortus and live e. coli o157:h <dig> for 5 min. the levels of paf secretion in the culture supernatants were quantified by paf elisa. data represent the mean ± sd of triplicate trials from three independent experiments. statistically significant differences from the untreated samples are indicated by asterisks .  cells pretreated with paf , a pafr agonist, for 5 min and ag <dig> , a jak <dig> inhibitor, for 1 h were infected with b. abortus for 5 min.  cells were also were infected with heat-killed b. abortus or live e. coli o157:h <dig> for 5 min. the cells were processed for immunoprecipitation with a lpcat <dig> antibody and then were probed with a phosphoserine antibody. the membrane was then stripped and re-probed with lpcat <dig> antibody. the images shown are representative of three independent experiments



phosphorylation of lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyltransferase  <dig> , an enzyme involved in the synthesis of paf from lyso-paf, enhances paf production in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages  <cit> . we hypothesized that b. abortus could augment the activation of lpcat <dig> as a key step for paf production, hence we investigated the phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated lpcat <dig> in b. abortus-infected cells. as a result, b. abortus infection and paf stimulation resulted in notable increase in the values of lpcat <dig> activation by  <dig>  % at 5 min post-infection compared to resting cells . in contrast, the lpcat <dig> activation values were reduced to  <dig>  % at 5 min post-infection in jak2-inhibited cells. moreover, the lpcat <dig> activation was not significantly high in cells infected with heat-killed b. abortus compared to resting cells or live b. abortus, but that of e. coli o157:h <dig> infection showed an increase activation  as much as that of live b. abortus . in correlation with the lpcat <dig> phosphorylation data, these findings demonstrated that lpcat <dig> is activated during uptake of b. abortus into macrophages mediated by jak <dig> signaling pathway.

pafr-linked event triggers uptake of b. abortus into macrophages
several studies indicated that b. abortus-induced paf production is involved in pafr-mediated signaling pathway, and accumulating studies have shown that pafr has important roles for bacterial infections  <cit> . thus, we further investigated how pafr is involved in the uptake of b. abortus. macrophage cells were stimulated with various concentrations of paf, which effectively acts through pafr, in an artificial manner for a range of incubation times followed by infection with b. abortus. the uptake of b. abortus was significantly increased by the stimulation of paf for 5 min in a dose-dependent pattern compared with untreated cells  . conversely, the inhibition of pafr function by the pafr antagonist cv <dig> resulted in notably reduced uptake of b. abortus in a dose-dependent pattern  . additionally, when we tested the effects of pafr activation on b. abortus internalization with different infection doses , the numbers of internalized bacteria were significantly increased at moi  <dig> than moi  <dig> in control cells but also in paf-treated cells . these results verify that pafr activation by paf contributes to the uptake of b. abortus into macrophages.fig.  <dig> the stimulation of pafr positively affects uptake of b. abortus into macrophages.  raw  <dig>  cells were pretreated for 5 min with serial concentrations  of paf, a pafr agonist, followed by infection with b. abortus for the indicated times.  cells were pretreated for 1 h with a serial concentration  of cv <dig>  a pafr antagonist, and then infected as described in . bacterial internalization efficiency was determined by evaluating the protection of internalized bacteria from gentamicin treatment. all data represent the mean ± sd of triplicate trials from three independent experiments. statistically significant differences from the untreated samples are indicated by asterisks 



pafr-induced activation of jak <dig> signaling is augmented by uptake of b. abortus into macrophages
some studies have found that stimulation of pafr by paf activates jak <dig> as demonstrated in a mutant pafr which failed to activate jak <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . previously, we confirmed that the activation of jak <dig> and downstream proteins were induced during the uptake of b. abortus into macrophages  <cit> . thus, we investigated the phosphorylation of jak <dig> and the downstream protein p38α to verify whether pafr-induced jak <dig> activation is associated with b. abortus uptake by macrophages. in agreement with previous findings, jak <dig> phosphorylation was increased upon b. abortus infection, and the stimulation of pafr by paf boosts jak <dig> activation  during b. abortus uptake . in contrast, the suppression of pafr by cv <dig> resulted in no considerable difference in the phosphorylation state of jak <dig> compared with the resting state of pafr, but jak <dig> activation was hindered  upon b. abortus infection . these findings indicate that stimulation of pafr upon infection of b. abortus in macrophages induces activation of jak <dig> fig.  <dig> activation of pafr-associated jak <dig> signaling involved in b. abortus uptake.  raw  <dig>  cells were pretreated for 5 min with a serial concentration  of paf. of the paf-treated cells, cells in  <dig> and  <dig> nm paf were infected with b. abortus for 5 min. the cells were lysed, and the activation of jak <dig> and p38α were monitored by immunoblot analysis. images shown are representatives of three independent experiments.  cells were pretreated with cv <dig>  for 1 h, followed by infection with b. abortus for the indicated times , and then monitored by immunoblot analysis as described in .  cells pretreated with or without ag <dig>  for 1 h were stimulated with paf , and then the infection assay was conducted using the same procedure used to evaluate bacterial uptake into macrophages. statistically significant differences from the untreated samples are indicated by asterisks 



interaction of pafr with intracellular jak <dig> signaling assisted uptake of b. abortus into macrophages
together with the supporting data referring to pafr-related jak <dig> signaling  <cit> , we investigated whether b. abortus entry is involved in the interaction of pafr with intracellular jak <dig> signaling. consequently, we examined whether the attenuation of b. abortus uptake by inhibition of jak <dig> is altered by stimulation or interference of pafr. the progressively increased uptake of b. abortus by paf stimulation in untreated cells , in contrast to the reduced uptake in jak2-inactivated cells, was slightly altered by paf stimulation . these results suggested that pafr is linked to intracellular jak <dig>  which acts as its downstream signal, and has an important role in the uptake process of b. abortus into macrophages. collectively, these findings suggest that pafr interacts with intracellular jak <dig> signaling for the uptake of b. abortus into macrophages.

pafr has a positive effect on phagocytosis of b. abortus into macrophages and amplifies actin polymerization
the association of pafr with phagocytosis illuminated the function of pafr as an infection control protein  <cit> , and the recruitment of pafr with intracellular kinases elicits distinct actin rearrangement  <cit> . furthermore, we previously demonstrated that b. abortus uptake was accompanied by activation of jak <dig> occurred through f-actin polymerization  <cit> . thus, to determine whether jak <dig> activation-associated actin polymerization in the phagocytosis of b. abortus is affected by pafr function, we first visualized f-actin polymerization during b. abortus invasion into pafr-stimulated or pafr-suppressed macrophages. for preliminary tests, we checked whether fluorescent labeling influences infectivity of bacteria which indicated that fluorescent-labeled b. abortus hardly affected the efficacy of infection in macrophages /well in unconjugated bacteria vs  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cfu /well in alexa flour 405-conjugated bacteria). as expected, the stimulation of pafr by paf augmented f-actin polymerization upon uptake of b. abortus and showed high levels of f-actin rearrangement as much as that of b. abortus-infected control cells . however, actin polymerization induced by b. abortus uptake was reduced in the cv3988-treated pafr-suppressed cells . these findings indicated that pafr contributes to b. abortus phagocytosis by boosting f-actin polymerization. next, we further examined the reorganization of cytosolic activated jak <dig> and its colocalization with f-actin during b. abortus invasion into pafr-stimulated or pafr-suppressed macrophages. the results revealed that the reorganization of activated jak <dig> and the colocalization with f-actin were heightened by the stimulation of pafr and attenuated by the suppression of pafr . consequently, these results suggest that pafr has a positive effect on jak <dig> activation-induced actin polymerization for b. abortus phagocytosis into macrophages.fig.  <dig> pafr cooperates with jak <dig> signaling for phagocytosis of b. abortus. raw  <dig>  cells were pretreated with or without paf  for 5 min or cv <dig>  for 1 h prior to infection; the cells were then infected with alexa fluor 405-labeled b. abortus  for the indicated times. to observe redistribution of f-actin polymerization and activated jak <dig>  the cells were fixed and stained with both rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for f-actin  and fitc-labeled phospho-jak <dig> antibody  immediately following a 10 min infection. the merged images are also shown and all scale bars in images represent 10 μm. all results are representatives of three separate experiments



based on the finding of cytoskeletal f-actin redistribution, we evaluated the f-actin content upon b. abortus uptake by facs analysis to quantitatively confirm the action of pafr on f-actin polymerization for b. abortus phagocytosis. the stimulation of pafr and b. abortus infection led to a significant amplification in f-actin fluorescence intensity  and a rightward intensity shift compared with non-stimulated or non-infected cells . in contrast, the suppression of pafr resulted in a marked reduction of f-actin content in b. abortus-infected cells but not in non-infected cells . these results suggested that pafr is associated with the intensification of f-actin polymerization for the phagocytosis of b. abortus into macrophages. according to the effects of pafr activation on b. abortus internalization with different infection doses, we additionally investigated f-actin polymerization related to pafr activation for phagocytosis of b. abortus with different infection doses through gating on infected cells. as a result, the intensity of f-actin showed an infection dose-dependent increase and the gating on infected cells have a tendency to increase than that of gating only viable cells . collectively, we confirm that pafr may be a critical signal transduction promoter for f-actin polymerization during b. abortus infection in macrophages.fig.  <dig> pafr activation plays a critical role in intensifying f-actin polymerization for phagocytosis of b. abortus. raw  <dig>  cells were pretreated for 5 min with paf  followed by infection with b. abortus for  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  min, and then cells were subjected to facs analysis for f-actin content.  the quantitative analysis results of experiment in . the average f-actin content of a population was expressed as the mean of the fluorescence intensity. data represent the mean ± sd of triplicate trials from three independent experiments. statistically significant differences from the untreated samples are indicated by asterisks 



trafficking of pafr from the membrane to endosomes is induced by the uptake of b. abortus
paf-mediated pafr ligation causes receptor internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis  to transduce extracellular signals  <cit> . following paf stimulation, pafr becomes rapidly desensitized, internalized, and down-regulated, of which pathway is dependent on proteasome, lysosomal pathways and ubiquitination  <cit> . we assume that b. abortus induces the production of paf for signal transduction via pafr and subsequent paf-stimulated pafr ligation followed by internalization of pafr from the membrane. to verify this hypothesis, we assessed the amount of peripheral membrane-engaged receptor in membrane isolates from b. abortus-infected cells. the membrane-engaged pafr showed reduced values of  <dig>  % in b. abortus-infected cells and  <dig>  % in paf-treated cells at 30 min compared to that at 5 min . thus, this result indicates that pafr is internalized from the membrane upon paf stimulation, which was produced following b. abortus infection after 30 min.

furthermore, we visualized the internalization of pafr from the membrane and the subsequent trafficking of pafr to endosomes upon b. abortus infection. the levels of colocalization of pafr with endosomes at 30 min post-infection in b. abortus-infected and paf-treated cells increased to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, compared to resting cells . this observation indicates that the increased colocalization of pafr with endosomes during b. abortus uptake is correlated with the reduced amount of membrane-engaged pafr.fig.  <dig> uptake of b. abortus induces trafficking of pafr to endosomes.  raw  <dig>  cells were pretreated for 5 min with paf , and then b. abortus in medium containing 1 mg/ml of trdx was deposited onto cells followed by incubation at 37 °c for 30 min. immunostaining with fitc-labeled pafr  was used to detect the colocalization of pafr and endosomes . the merged images showed colocalization of pafr and endosomes .  the quantitative analysis results of experiment in . the colocalization number of endosomes with pafr was counted, and the data are presented as a percentage per  <dig> cells. all results are representatives of three separate experiments . all scale bars in images represent 10 μm



discussion
brucella spp. utilize intracellular infection as a virulence strategy and interact with a wide range of host cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and placental trophoblasts . the macrophage response to infection causes diverse effects and is critically important for both the endurance of the invasive bacteria and the development of host immunity  <cit> . thus, it is important to verify the molecular targets of b. abortus in host cells and the virulence strategy used by the bacteria to thwart the host defense responses. in this study, we established an underlying virulence strategy employed by b. abortus involving a host cell signaling pathway for phagocytosis of this virulent pathogen. we thus identified the molecular events in the host cell that are essential for the phagocytic strategy used by b. abortus.

during the initiation of infection, several macrophage receptors with specific binding sites, including tlr <dig>  <cit> , that interact directly with brucella have been identified. however, how the receptor enhances phagocytic activity by specific stimuli as a mediator of signal transduction upon infection remains poorly understood.

the invasion of pathogenic organisms into the host elicits a series of immune responses through interactions between a variety of pathogen virulence factors and the immune surveillance mechanisms of the host. host-pathogen interactions are commonly initiated via host recognition of conserved molecular compositions known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> , which are indispensable for the survival of the pathogen. detection of pamps by a variety of pattern recognition receptors   <cit> , such as toll-like receptors , rig-i-like receptors , and nod-like receptors  triggers the recruitment of diverse adaptor proteins and the activation of downstream signal transduction pathways. this leads to responses essential for defense of the host, including phagocytosis of pathogens, microbial killing, and production of chemokines and cytokines. in addition to the prrs, another recognition system mediated by pafr has been reported  <cit> . pafr is a gpcr that naturally recognizes the phosphorylcholine determinant on paf but also recognizes pamp phosphorylcholine, which results in the uptake of bacteria into host cells. previous studies concerning the association of pafr with bacterial phagocytosis have shown that pafr and its stimulation by ligands exert multiple immunoregulatory reactions by host cells against bacterial infections. these reactions include the promotion of phagocytosis, killing, and cell adhesion  <cit> , suggesting the essential role of pafr in bacterial invasion. phagocytosis via pafr has been shown in several respiratory pathogens that possess phosphorylcholine on their surfaces . the trafficking and inflammatory consequences of the interaction of the phosphorylcholine-containing cell wall with pafr have been determined at the level of cellular physiology as well as in animal models  <cit> . in contrast, consistent with the fact that b. abortus cell wall lacks phosphorylcholine while they have a phosphatidylcholine as a major component of the cell envelope and a requirement for wild-type virulence, we found that colocalization of pafr with b. abortus did not occur during b. abortus uptake using confocal microscopy in preliminary test . because a direct contact between pafr and b. abortus was not detected, we thus assessed the effects of a pafr ligand, paf, on signal transduction during an entry step in macrophage infection by b. abortus.

paf has diverse immunomodulatory actions for the host defense against bacterial infections, including stimulation and degranulation of granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages  <cit> . in an extensive aspect of the relation between paf and bacteria, we found that b. abortus infection led to a remarkable production of paf during invasion. furthermore, we postulated that paf produced upon b. abortus infection affects pafr-mediated events for the advanced uptake of b. abortus, hence uptake of b. abortus into macrophage was investigated by extrinsic treatment with paf. the number of internalized b. abortus was significantly increased in paf-stimulated cells, indicating that the stimulated pafr enhances b. abortus uptake into macrophages. this phenotype is dependent on paf stimulation time as our results show that treatment with paf for 5 min more significantly increases internalization than treatment for 30 min. in contrast, the inhibition of pafr function notably reduced the uptake of b. abortus. possibly, the same mechanism occurs in pafr through b. abortus-induced paf on phagocytosis of b. abortus into host cell. collectively, these findings suggest that the stimulation of pafr actively influenced b. abortus phagocytosis and confirmed that pafr has the potential to serve as a trigger for the uptake of b. abortus.

the pafr-associated intracellular signaling pathway was found to involve the intracellular tyrosine kinase jak <dig>  which resulted from the findings that jak <dig> fails to become phosphorylated in a pafr mutant  <cit> . in agreement with a positive effect of pafr on jak <dig> activation, the phosphorylation of jak <dig> was increased by b. abortus infection, and the b. abortus-induced jak <dig> activation was augmented through pafr stimulation by paf. in contrast, upon inhibition of pafr, the elevated jak <dig> activation by b. abortus infection was obstructed at the internalization stage. indeed, these findings suggest that pafr-involved jak <dig> activation could be a virulence strategy critical for b. abortus invasion into host cells.

it has been known that pafr activation induces the recruitment of intracellular kinases leading to distinct actin rearrangement at the plasma membrane  <cit> . to determine if this occurs upon b. abortus infection of macrophages engaged in jak <dig> activation, we observed the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cytosolic activated jak <dig> during b. abortus uptake by pafr-stimulated or -suppressed macrophages. as expected, the microscopy results revealed that the f-actin polymerization and the redistribution of activated jak <dig> were augmented by stimulation of pafr. furthermore, facs analysis showed increased f-actin fluorescence intensity upon pafr stimulation, which correlates with our microscopy results. therefore, the b. abortus-induced effect on actin polymerization enhanced by pafr-associated jak <dig> activation could be essential for macrophage infection by this pathogen. in addition, regarding the infection dose, we verified that the number of internalized bacteria and intensity of f-actin were enhanced in higher infection dose  than in lower one , indicating the effects and levels of pafr activation on b. abortus phagocytosis into macrophage have a tendency to be proportional to the infection dose.

b. abortus infection induced intracellular lyso-phosphocholine acetyltransferase  activation, which subsequently participated in paf synthesis. advanced studies have shown the complex pathway connecting the stimulation of pafr through enhanced paf production by extracellular stimuli which initiates receptor internalization  <cit> . on the other hand, the experiment to verify whether paf production linked to lpcat <dig> activation is caused by live brucella infection in comparison with killed bacteria and e. coli o157:h <dig> as a non-brucella control revealed that the positive effect on lpcat <dig> activation-related paf production is practically related with live brucella infection but not killed bacteria. but the same positive effects of e. coli o157:h <dig> infection as much as those of live b. abortus corresponded with previous study that described a significant increase in paf production by human colonic tissue for 4 h after infection by enterohemorrhagic e. coli   <cit> . thus, our results revealed that live brucella infection also induced paf production through activation of lpcat <dig> similar to other bacteria but we particularly verified that this enhancement is linked to the jak2-mediated pathway. moreover, the internalization and degradation of pafr were induced by stimulation of paf, which can be maintained by proteasome and lysosomal pathways  <cit> . in line with these signal pathways, the fundamental proposal is that b. abortus could induce the production of paf, which may be advantageous for invasion. subsequently, the pafr stimulation by b. abortus-induced paf secretion causes mobilization and trafficking in membrane-engaged pafr compared with the resting condition. this finding is supported by the evidence showing the increased trafficking of pafr to endosomes, which is in accordance with the internalization of pafr from the membrane upon b. abortus infection. considering the relevant evidence that brucella cause a weak response in innate immune system, of which mechanism is likely that brucella do not rely on single distinct virulence factor  <cit> , the event involving pafr trafficking upon b. abortus infection could indirectly regulate pafr-mediated signaling activation in an integrated aspect of host-pathogen interaction.

thus, this sequential processing and correlation implies that b. abortus utilizes a supporting mechanism , which modulates the activation of pafr-mediated jak <dig> signaling pathway during the entry step of infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study concludes that b. abortus promotes paf production, which induces pafr-linked jak <dig> signaling activation to successfully invade macrophages. it seems likely that b. abortus may enable us to further elaborate mechanisms of intracellular signaling cascades connected to membrane receptor activation. thus, we establish a correlation between receptor-mediated cellular signaling and the pathogenic strategy of b. abortus.
