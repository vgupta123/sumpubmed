BACKGROUND
linear chromosome ends of nearly all eukaryotes consist of repetitive telomeric sequences that protect the integrity of the genome. this function is assisted by interacting proteins, generally referred to as the telosome, which are essential for functional telomeres  <cit> . in mammals, a protein complex consisting of six core members  protects the ttaggg-repeat telomeres from recognition by the dna damage repair machinery  <cit>  with trf <dig> and trf <dig> being direct double-strand telomere binding proteins and pot <dig> binding the ttaggg single-strand overhang. additionally, hot <dig> was recently identified as a third direct double-strand telomere binding protein in mammals involved in telomerase-mediated telomere homeostasis  <cit> .

while baker’s yeast  and fission yeast  telomeres have been extensively studied and used as a model in telomere biology, they are both rather exceptional, as they feature degenerated telomeric repeats in juxtaposition to canonical repeat motifs found in most other eukaryotes. furthermore, the telosomes of these two yeast model species differ greatly: in baker’s yeast, the degenerated double-strand repeats are recognized by rap <dig> which interacts with rif <dig> and rif <dig>  <cit> , while in fission yeast the direct double-strand binding protein taz <dig>  <cit>  anchors a telomeric multi-protein complex consisting of taz <dig>  rap <dig>  poz <dig>  ccq <dig>  tpz <dig> and pot <dig>  <cit> .

despite their potentially distinct telomere biology, considerable effort has been made to identify telomere binding proteins in these yeast species. while the identification of telomere binding proteins by their ability to bind telomeric repeats in purification experiments seems straightforward, this strategy has become even more applicable recently due to advances in protein identification by mass spectrometry. for instance, proteomic isolation of chromatin fragments , a reverse chip method, has been established on human telomeres  <cit> . similarly, classical dna affinity purification was used to identify trf <dig> by mass spectrometry  <cit>  and the same technique in combination with silac has uncovered hot <dig> as a direct telomeric dna binding protein  <cit> . the latter comparison also highlights how advances in proteomics have enabled the discovery of novel telomeric factors. additionally, a quantitative telomeric chromatin isolation protocol  based on immunopurification of trf <dig> has been used to identify telomeric proteins  <cit> . however, the known telomere binders in fungi have been identified by different means prior to streamlined applicability of proteomics. rap <dig> was first identified based on its recombinant protein being similarly sensitive to protease digestion as the telomere binding activity in s. cerevisiae and on both sharing similar size and specificity  <cit> . similarly, taz <dig> has not been initially identified by its ability to bind telomeric repeats, but as a factor strongly enhancing telomere length in a genetic screen  <cit> . more recently, a double-strand telomere binding protein in yarrowia lipolytica was identified by sequence comparison focusing on its two myb domains similar to the human trfs  <cit> . we reasoned that an unbiased, proteome-wide interactomics approach would thus be beneficial to uncover the telosome in a not yet characterized fungus, as it allows the detection of telomeric proteins without assumptions and/or prior knowledge. we have previously demonstrated that we are able to identify direct telomere binding proteins in mouse and human  <cit>  and here we apply single-step dna affinity purification combined with quantitative proteomics to identify the direct telomere binding proteins in neurospora crassa.

we chose neurospora because little is known about the telosome of ttaggg-repeat telomeric fungi, and it would be appealing to have a model organism that more directly relates to human telomeres in terms of sequence. indeed, it was recently shown that while fungal and vertebrate telomerase rnas share a common ancestral core, the n. crassa telomerase is more closely related to vertebrates  <cit> . it is thus likely that its telomere binding proteins are more closely related to those of vertebrate species compared to the current yeast models. here we investigated a comprehensive telosome for n. crassa and uncover proteins directly binding to ttaggg repeats, providing a basis for further functional characterization of n. crassa telomere biology as an emerging model organism.

RESULTS
identification of the neurospora telosome by quantitative proteomics
for the identification of telomere binding proteins we performed telomere pull-downs  <cit>  with cellular extracts from n. crassa in quadruplicates for a telomeric  and a control  bait . the bound proteins were eluted from the immobilized oligonucleotides by boiling and separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. each sample lane was cut into four slices to reduce sample complexity for subsequent analysis. the gel pieces were digested with trypsin and peptides measured on a mass spectrometer. after measurement of each individual pull-down, we employed label-free quantitative analysis empowered by maxlfq  <cit>  to obtain enrichment values between target and control bait. we only considered proteins that were detected and quantified in three of our four replicates introducing a very stringent reproducibility filter. by this approach, we identified and quantified  <dig> proteins of which only  <dig> were significantly  enriched at the telomeric ttaggg repeat . each of these  <dig> proteins shows strong enrichment at the telomere versus control bait in all replicates . for the control probe, we used a shuffled ttaggg sequence also employed in our previous analysis in human and mouse  <cit> . this control sequence was chosen to ensure that neither the repetitive nature of the telomeric motif nor the exact base content would present a bias in hit selection. while this sequence constitutes an artificial repeat not present in neurospora, we detected  <dig> uncharacterized proteins  that associate with this tgtgag repeat motif.fig.  <dig> experimental design and results of neurospora telomere pull-down. a schematic workflow of the label-free telomere interaction screen. extracts of n. crassa were incubated with either a telomeric probe  or a shuffled control sequence . for each probe, four pull-downs were performed independently and measured using high resolution mass spectrometry. to identify ttaggg repeat binding proteins the maxlfq algorithm was used to compare individual peptide intensities between the telomeric bait and the shuffled control sequence. b volcano plot of the telosome of n. crassa. we identified  <dig> proteins  to be enriched at the telomeric ttaggg probe compared to the shuffled control. c heatmap representation of z-scored enrichment values obtained from maxlfq intensities for the  <dig> significantly enriched neurospora proteins validates reproducible binding behaviour in each replicate



evolutionary conservation of ttaggg-associated proteins in fungi
upon inspection of the  <dig> ttaggg-enriched proteins, we noticed that half of them  had an annotated nucleic acid binding domain . however, as protein annotations and functional descriptions of proteins in neurospora are extremely limited, we used sequence similarity comparisons with other yeasts to determine the homologs of our candidates in order to obtain further information . to cover homology in all major yeast branches, we performed reverse blast searches against s. cerevisiae, s. pombe and candida albicans. we further included the fungus a. fumigatus in our analysis, which also has a ttaggg-repeat telomere and is more closely related to n. crassa.fig.  <dig> structure and evolutionary conservation of ttaggg-associated proteins. a domain structure of neurospora proteins reported by interpro  <dig>  . the position of the domains and length of the proteins are drawn to scale. b overview of the corresponding homologs in s. cerevisiae, s. pombe, c. albicans and a. fumigatus as determined by sequence similarity search. the telomeric motifs are indicated for each species. blast hits in black are true homologs whereas blast hits in white showed weak homology and the reverse blast identified a different homologous protein. the first e-value represents the search of the n. crassa protein vs. the respective species and the second e-value the reverse blast search. n. crassa names in blue are proposed based on experimental data from this study



as expected, we obtained the highest number of homologs  in the closely related fungus a. fumigatus. for around half of our candidates, we were still able to also identify homologs in the other three yeast species. while the proteins from c. albicans and a. fumigatus are not characterized, nearly all homologs in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe were already implicated in -telomere regulation, confirming that we indeed identified telomeric proteins by our quantitative mass spectrometry screen . ncu <dig> is orthologous to the single-strand binding protein tcg <dig> from s. pombe  <cit>  and also has a weak homology to the telomeric ssdna-binding protein nsr <dig> of s. cerevisiae  <cit> . we equally identified the homolog of the s. cerevisiae telomeric ssdna-binding protein gbp <dig>  <cit>  called ncu <dig>  cross-confirming this finding, we also affinity-purified gbp <dig> from a similar telomere pull-down screen using a degenerated telomeric repeat with s. cerevisiae extracts . ncu <dig> is the homolog of the essential tbf <dig>  in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . furthermore, ncu <dig> is homologous to tay <dig>  <cit> , which can bind both the yarrowia lipolytica telomeric sequence  as well as ttaggg repeats  <cit> . finally, ncu <dig> has weak homology to tbf <dig> and with the presence of a myb/homeobox domain  shows the common dna-binding domain of telomeric proteins. to use comparable naming to yeast, we suggest to rename ncu <dig> as tbf <dig>  ncu <dig> as tbf <dig>  ncu <dig> as tay <dig>  ncu <dig> as gbp <dig> and ncu <dig> as tcg <dig> in neurospora.

investigation of binding characteristics of the neurospora proteins
as direct telomere binders usually represent key proteins in a telosome, we wanted to identify which of our candidates are direct and specific ttaggg-repeat binding proteins. for seven candidates we were able to clone the entire coding sequence from cdna and to express recombinant proteins. several candidates failed at the cloning step, putatively due to incorrect gene predictions. for instance, during the cloning of ncu <dig>  we noted a different exon structure compared to its bioinformatics prediction . the seven expressed proteins were tested for their ability to directly bind to our telomeric bait. strikingly, six of the investigated seven proteins were able to bind directly to the ttaggg repeat sequences . as our bait preparation relies on concatemerization of oligonucleotides with repetitive sequences to longer fragments, our bait carries a short single-stranded overhang. therefore, we next dissected whether the direct association was due to binding of single- or double-stranded dna by a competition assay . only ncu02404/ncgbp <dig>  which is homologous to the telomeric single-strand binding protein gbp <dig> in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , showed diminished binding at elevated single-strand ttaggg competitor concentrations. binding of ncu02404/ncgbp <dig> is probably mediated via its rrm domains  similar to the binding of several human rrm domain proteins such as hnrnpa <dig> and hnrnpa2/b <dig> to telomeric ssdna  <cit> . the other rrm-domain protein  identified as putative telosome member by our screen  is orthologous to the single-strand binding protein tcg <dig> from s. pombe, illustrating that n. crassa may have two single strand telomeric proteins. the other five candidates were validated as double-strand telomere repeat binding proteins. two of them  feature a classical myb/homeobox domain that is also found in the three direct binding vertebrate telomeric factors trf <dig>  trf <dig> and hot <dig>  <cit> . in addition, for ncu <dig> the zinc-finger is the only annotated dna-binding domain in this protein , suggesting that it recognizes ttaggg repeats via this domain. for the last two proteins  directly recognizing double-stranded ttaggg repeats in our assay, the dna binding domain still needs to be identified. for the other four candidates of our proteomic screen, the binding behaviour of ncu <dig>  ncu <dig> and ncu <dig> remains to be established, while ncu <dig> likely associates via protein-protein interactions. in addition, ncu03146/nctbf <dig>  one of the proteins that failed during the cloning step, is the direct homolog of the ttaggg-repeat binding protein tbf <dig> and it is therefore also likely a direct telomere binding protein in n. crassa. in summary, we propose that the telosome of n. crassa contains at least eight direct telomere binding proteins, inferred by direct binding tests and/or homology search.fig.  <dig> characterization of binding mode of neurospora ttaggg-binding proteins. a western blots from pull-downs of recombinantly expressed neurospora proteins incubated with concatemerized oligonucleotides of telomeric repeats  or a shuffled control sequence  to check for direct binding. b comparative binding test for double-stranded versus single-stranded telomeric dna. direct ttaggg-binding proteins from  were incubated with increasing amounts of single-stranded ttaggg repeats. only ncu <dig> binding is decreased at higher ssttaggg oligonucleotide concentrations revealing the other  <dig> proteins as double-strand binders. c western blot of the competition assay of ncu <dig> shows that its binding can only be competed with ssttaggg but not with an unrelated control sequence



comparison of telomere associated proteins in fungi
our quantitative proteomic screen has identified  <dig> ttaggg-associated proteins in neurospora, an organism where no telomeric protein was previously known. of this set, we classified eight proteins as ttaggg-repeat binding either inferred from homology and/or validated experimentally  with two proteins recognizing the single-strand overhang and six proteins binding the double-strand ttaggg repeat. the single-strand binders have clear homologs in other yeasts, arguing that they are likely functionally conserved. among the proteins we could not further characterize, the orthologue of ncu <dig>  has already been shown to be important for rna-dna hybrid resolution at s. cerevisiae telomeres  <cit> , suggesting that we identified a comprehensive set of telomeric proteins in n. crassa.fig.  <dig> model for the n. crassa telosome based on our mass spectrometric screen and the binding analysis. neurospora has at least six double strand binding proteins  and two single-strand binding proteins of which we have experimentally validated one  while the other  was inferred from homology. connections indicate homologs between neurospora and the other yeast species



the identification of a minimum of six ttaggg double-strand binding proteins in neurospora is unexpected. when we compare to ttaggg binding proteins in the closely related telomere models only one protein  has been reported in s. cerevisiae and three  in s. pombe / y. lipolytica. intriguingly, these three conserved proteins between s. pombe / y. lipolytica and neurospora all contain the classical myb/homeobox domain found also in the vertebrate telomere proteins trf <dig>  trf <dig> and hot <dig>  while myb/homeobox domain proteins may be linked to core functions at the telomere, additional proteins may have been recruited in evolution to recognize ttaggg repeats in a context in which they served as actual chromosome extremities. for instance, we here demonstrate that the zinc finger protein ncu <dig> can also recognize these repeats and may represent an emerging class of telomere binding proteins, including zscan <dig>  <cit>  and ring1b  <cit> . ncu <dig> is the first zinc finger protein shown to directly bind ttaggg repeats. the high number of ttaggg-binding proteins in neurospora may directly relate to the ttaggg repeat being its telomeric sequence, requiring additional functionality in comparison to s. cerevisiae where the ttaggg sequence is found in the subtelomere. it is furthermore possible that also in s. pombe and s. cerevisiae not all direct telomere binding proteins are yet known as similar systematic investigations based on affinity purification have not yet been reported for these yeast models.

we did not identify any homologs to the proteins directly binding to the degenerated telomeric repeats in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe in our screen. this might be the result of divergent evolution and it is therefore attractive to speculate that the degenerated repeat telomeres and their binding proteins are a specialization in these yeast species and that they co-exist with a rudimentary core ttaggg-repeat binding machinery shared among all yeast species. based on our knowledge of neurospora telomere binding proteins, it is likely that tbf <dig> end-capping in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  is a remnant of an evolutionarily retained function. the additional ttaggg- associated proteins reb <dig>  env <dig>  vid <dig> in s. cerevisiae  likely reflect adaptations to the use of ttaggg repeats as s. cerevisiae subtelomeres. it seems therefore likely that the canonical repeats such as ttaggg are the actual ancestral core found in the vast majority of species in all clades and that the degenerated repeats in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe are a special telomeric situation in some fungi. our data strongly supports the hypothesis that tbf <dig> homologs in fungi originate from a common ancestor with a function in telomere regulation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our current experimental data sheds light on the evolutionary conservation of telomere-binding proteins and uncovers more ttaggg-binding proteins in neurospora as expected, suggesting it as an attractive new model species in telomere biology.
