BACKGROUND
ruminants have acquired a number of physiological and anatomical specialisations in order to adapt to a lifestyle in which pasture is the predominant source of metabolic energy. most notably ruminants have a fore-stomach, the rumen, in which pasture polysaccharides are broken down by microbial β-glycosidases in a neutral ph anaerobic environment. in addition, ruminants have other adaptations, including a markedly different saliva composition compared with monogastric mammals  <cit> . it is assumed that these physiological adaptations must be accompanied by genetic changes, however, there have been few reports of changes in the genomes of ruminants, which facilitate a specialised ruminant physiological function. virtually the only such report is of the expansion of the lysozyme locus in cattle  <cit> . the recent availability of a draft cattle genome sequence, the first for a ruminant, provides an opportunity to discover additional genetic characteristics that facilitate the ruminant lifestyle.

the bactericidal/permeability increasing protein  plays an important role in host-defence in mammals. bpi is found in the secretory granules of neutrophils and is secreted in response to activation of toll-like receptor -mediated signalling, whereupon it acts as an innate immune effector protein by permeabilising the plasma membrane of gram negative bacteria as well as attenuating the tlr response  <cit> . three well-characterised proteins have some sequence conservation with bpi. lipopolysaccharide binding protein  is secreted from the liver into the circulation where it appears to act as a sensor for the presence of bacteria  <cit> . lbp acts as an opsin, binding lipopolysaccharide  derived from the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria, and thence stimulating a tlr-mediated innate immune response  <cit> . phospholipid transfer protein  and cholesteryl ester transfer protein  function as lipid transport proteins in the blood . recent reports have shown the existence of at least  <dig> additional genes in humans and mice, which are related to bpi through sequence similarity, exon segmentation and predicted secondary structure  <cit> . all but two of these are found as a gene cluster at a single locus on human chromosome  <dig> or the syntenic region of mouse chromosome  <dig>  the similarity of the products of these genes to bpi and lbp, their expression in oral cavity and airways tissues  <cit>  and evidence for the antimicrobial activity of at least one of them  <cit>  suggests that they play a role in host defence.

we have previously characterised two closely related members of the expanded bpi-like protein family in cattle. these proteins, bsp30a and bsp30b, are expressed in saliva and are both most closely related to human and mouse psp  <cit> . we have now characterised the entire bpi-like protein locus in cattle in order to understand the relationship of the bsp30a and bsp30b genes to one another and to psp, and to understand the evolutionary events that have occurred in the locus in cattle, particularly gene duplication. here we report that the bovine locus contains  <dig> bpi-like genes, comprising nine homologues of bpi-like genes from mouse and human as well as four paralogues of psp, two of which have not been previously described. these appear to have arisen from a series of gene duplication events. their distinct patterns of transcript abundance, and their presence in at least some other ruminant species is consistent with the multiple bsp <dig> genes having a specific role in ruminant physiology.

RESULTS
characterisation of the bovine bpi-like locus
six bovine bacs spanning the bpi-like locus were identified by alignment of bovine bac end sequences with the region of the human genome sequence containing the bpi-like locus. these bacs were subjected to random shotgun high throughput sequencing. these sequences, as well as sequence contigs from the bovine assembly  were used to create a single  <dig>  bp contig as described in the methods .

to identify the genes within the bovine genomic contig, sequences from human and bovine refseq, and tigr bovine gene indices, along with the known bovine bpi-like gene sequences from genbank and ensembl bovine gene predictions, were mapped onto the contig using the gmap and exonerate programs. in total,  <dig> putative genes or pseudogenes were identified. of these,  <dig> contiguous genes spanning  <dig> kbp appeared to be related to members of the bpi-like family . the gene order obtained resembled that of the previously characterised human and mouse bpi-like loci  <cit>  much more closely than that of the bostau v <dig>  assembly , due to assembly errors in the ver  <dig>  of the bovine assembly. among the  <dig> genes, only bsp30a, bsp30b, plunc and vemsgp have been previously described and characterised in cattle  <cit> . for two of the genes , cdna sequence was obtained by sequencing of individual cdna clones and extension using 5' and 3' race. after re-sequencing, a correction was made to the previously determined bsp30a sequence . for one of the genes  the ensembl bovine gene prediction was found to be the putative cdna sequence that better matched homologues in other species. for three of the genes  a better match to other species was obtained by combining the ensembl and refseq predicted sequences. for two other genes  the final cdna sequences were produced by the genscan gene prediction program. these sequences  were aligned with the genomic contig using the spidey program  <cit>  to determine the position, number and size of the exons .

alignment of the bovine bpi-like predicted amino acid sequences revealed significant similarity with the known bpi-like genes from human and mouse. nine of the  <dig> bovine bpi-like genes were orthologous to genes in these species as they formed reciprocal pairs of top blast hits between species . the remaining five are most similar to psp from mouse and human, for which there is no unambiguous ortholog in bovine . two of these have been previously described as bsp30a and bsp30b  <cit> . we therefore named the two additional apparently complete genes bsp30c and bsp30d. the fifth,  is substantially truncated compared with other bpi-like genes. it contains an open reading frame containing  <dig> amino acids encoding a  <dig> kda protein and comprising three exons of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in length, and has no tata box or cpg islands associated with it. therefore, it is most likely a pseudogene. all  <dig> intact bovine bpi-like genes conform to the expected structure of bpi-like proteins, having a predicted mass of either approximately  <dig> kda or  <dig> kda, having either 6– <dig> or 15– <dig> exons, and having either one or two bpi domains. these predicted amino acid sequences include a secretion signal sequence of  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus. the subset of bpi-like proteins of approximately  <dig> kda having one bpi domain have been referred to as splunc1- <dig> and the approximately  <dig> kda proteins with two bpi domains as lplunc1- <dig>  <cit> . two conserved cysteines that have been shown to form a disulphide bond between amino acid  <dig> and  <dig> of human bpi  <cit>  are present in all the bovine bpi-like proteins, and are separated by 35– <dig> amino acid. the bovine base and lplunc <dig> genes, which appear to be pseudogenes in human, appear to be fully intact genes in cattle. no bovine homologues were found for the mouse bpi-like genes smgb, splunc <dig> or splunc <dig> 

expression of the bpi-like genes in cattle
each of the predicted bovine bpi-like cdna sequences were used as query to search for matches to experimentally produced cdna sequences contained in an agresearch database of ests  as well as the tigr bovine gene indices. positive matches were obtained for  <dig> of the  <dig> bovine bpi-like genes indicating they are expressed . alignment of the assembled est contigs with the predicted cdna sequences were used to refine the cdna sequences for bpil <dig>  bsp30c and splunc <dig> as described in the methods.

we have previously demonstrated that four members of the bpi-like protein family in cattle  are found in a restricted range of tissues associated with the bovine oral cavity and airways  <cit> . the pattern of transcript abundance of three additional bpi-like protein genes in cattle was determined by northern blotting using rna extracted from a range of bovine tissues. the results showed that bsp30c, splunc <dig>  and bpil <dig> are each expressed to a relatively high level in a restricted range of bovine tissues . bsp30c mrna was found in salivary glands, nasal mucosa, tongue and abomasum, while a high abundance of splunc <dig> transcripts was found only in tongue. bpil <dig> transcripts were found to be expressed only in the sublingual and buccal salivary glands, tonsil, cheek epithelium, and the soft palate.

evidence for expression of additional bpi-like proteins was obtained using rt-pcr. specific amplification was obtained using primers derived from bovine base, bpil <dig> and bsp30d. the nucleotide sequences of these pcr products were obtained  and were found to align with the predicted cdna sequences. base and bpil <dig> cdnas were amplified from salivary tissues, and in addition base cdna was amplified from the nasal mucosa. three distinct bands, each containing bsp30d cdna, were amplified from parotid and submandibular salivary tissue . the multiple bands are most likely due to variable splicing of bsp30d mrna. in total, evidence was obtained for the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> bpi-like genes in cattle .

evolution of the bpi-like locus
cattle is the third species, the others being human and mouse  <cit> , for which the complete bpi-like locus has been described. as a first step in understanding the evolutionary relationships among the members of the bpi-like family, the sequences from the intact genes within the bpi-like locus in cattle, human and mouse were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was constructed . this tree confirms the status of nine of the bovine genes as orthologs of genes in other species, and indicates that the four bsp <dig> genes are clearly most closely related to psp. in addition, the four bsp <dig> genes are part of a sub-group comprising all the single-domain proteins . of all the two-domain proteins, the vemsgp gene is most closely related to the single-domain proteins.

in order to determine the extent of evolutionary pressure on the bpi-like proteins, the ratio  of non-synonymous  to synonymous  substitutions was calculated between orthologous pairs of intact bpi-like genes as well as between the bsp <dig> and psp genes. the ratios were less than  <dig> for all but two of the  <dig> pairs of bpi-like orthologues . this indicates that there has been evolutionary pressure for amino acid sequence conservation in these genes since the divergence of human, mouse and cattle. a similar analysis of the four bsp <dig> genes together with human and mouse psp genes resulted in ratios not significantly different from  <dig> between pairings of the four bsp <dig> genes and either human or mouse psp. this indicates relaxation of pressure for amino acid sequence conservation . to determine if this was due to positive selection for divergence or solely relaxed selection for conservation i.e. if the ω values were different between the bovine bsp <dig> and human and mouse psp genes, two codeml branch models were fitted, one where the bovine bsp <dig> genes were allowed to have one ω ratio and the psp genes to have another ratio  and second where all bsp and psp genes had the same ratios . the likelihood of the model with different ratios  was found to be significantly better  than the one-ratio model , showing the evidence of positive selection. in addition, ratios between bsp30c and the other bsp <dig> proteins were significantly greater than  <dig>  indicating that there is positive selection pressure on bsp30c for divergence of its amino acid sequence from the other bsp <dig> proteins. to identify the amino acid sites under positive selection, four different models m1a , m2a , m <dig>  and m <dig>  were tested. the results are shown in table  <dig>  both the m2a and m <dig> models for selection were significantly better than m1a and m <dig> respectively, with evidence for a proportion of sites  under positive selection. the two models also identified six identical amino acid sites with bayesian probabilities of >  <dig>  to have the ω >  <dig> . protein threading analysis using the phyre program  <cit>  resulted in a very good fit  for bsp30a onto the structural model of the n-terminal domain of bpi, despite its less than 40% amino acid sequence identity. this suggests that among the bovine bpi-like proteins, at least bsp30a has the same protein fold as bpi, including a similar hydrophobic pocket. the six sites under positive selection were mapped onto the structure of bsp30a . five of the six sites are in positions that are likely to contribute to the shape of the hydrophobic pocket. it is possible that the hydrophobic pocket functions to bind a substrate. therefore, changes in these sites may influence the binding specificity of the protein.

the contiguous genomic sequence of the bovine bpi-like locus was aligned with the orthologous region from human using a dot-plot algorithm. for most of its length, the sequences from both species align approximately1: <dig>  however, a  <dig> kbp region of the bovine contig  contained a series of eight repeats, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kbp . four of the eight repeats contained the bsp30a, bsp30b, bsp30c and bsp30d genes within them. one of the remaining four repeats contained the pseudogene identified during initial characterisation of the locus  . a gene prediction analysis of the other three repeats resulted only in gene fragments. a similar analysis comparing the bovine sequence with that of mouse revealed no such repeats, but instead showed a large segment of the locus that did not align . a dot-plot alignment of the bovine bpi-like locus genomic sequence against the equivalent region of the dog genome revealed a similar series of eight repeats . the interspecies alignments showed that the repeated section in bovine is not present in the mouse genome, which is significantly diverged in this region.

a segment of the genomic contig from the ry2g <dig> to the base gene was used as query in a blast search of a bovine repetitive sequence database  <cit>  to search for the presence of repeat elements within it. the search returned two long interspersed nuclear elements , l1bt and rtebt <dig>  in total, significant alignments of greater than  <dig> bp were obtained at ten locations along the genomic segment. all but one of these were positioned within or very close to the gaps between the genomic duplications . it is possible that these line elements could have contributed to the genome instability in this region of the locus, resulting in the multiple gene duplications, in a manner analogous to what has previously been suggested for alu sequences in the human genome  <cit> .

discussion
this report provides the first characterisation of the locus encoding the bpi-like proteins in a ruminant species. the analyses have shed light on how the locus has evolved as well as raised possibilities regarding the function of the bpi-like proteins in ruminants. the structural similarity and clustering of the individual genes in the bpi-like locus in the bovine, mouse, and human genomes suggests evolution from a single ancestral gene, with gene duplication followed by divergent evolution giving rise to the differences between the family members. this appears to be particularly prevalent in the bovine bpi-like protein locus compared with the other species. gene duplication has been previously noted in ruminants. duplication of a single ancestral secretory rnase gene appears to have given rise to the separate pancreatic, seminal and brain rnase genes found in ruminants  <cit> . ruminants and other artiodactyls contain a large number of genes encoding the pregnancy-associated glycoproteins, which appear to have arisen by gene duplication  <cit> . duplication of the lysozyme gene is a feature in its recruitment as a digestive enzyme in ruminant artiodactyls  <cit> . the orientation of the genes in the bpi-like cluster is consistent with gene amplification by a series of unequal crossovers  <cit> . the presence of multiple line elements within the expanded bsp <dig> region of the locus provides one possible mechanism for the initiation step of the expansion.

the family of proteins in the cluster is divided into those with one or two bpi domains . the single-domain genes are contiguous within the cluster. it is possible that the ancestral bpi-like gene was a two-domain lipid binding protein. the six two-domain proteins then arose through a series of gene duplications. the first single-domain protein may have been created through duplication of the n-terminal portion of one of the two-domain proteins. the phylogenetic analysis together with their position in the locus suggests that this is most likely to have been the vemsgp gene giving rise to the plunc gene. under this scenario, subsequent duplication of plunc would have given rise to additional single-domain proteins, some of which could have been duplicated in turn, as appears to be the case with psp giving rise to the four bsp <dig> genes. the most recent duplication appears to have been that giving rise to bsp30a and b. the data indicates that duplication events have occurred more frequently than the minimal number of times required for the observed gene duplications. interestingly, it appears that there have been distinct duplications in the mouse lineage giving rise to splunc <dig> and splunc <dig> 

the duplications giving rise to the four bsp <dig> genes in cattle may have occurred after divergence of cattle from other mammals. examination of genome assemblies from other species indicates that human, dog and chimpanzee have only a single psp ortholog. furthermore, a search of est databases revealed only single psp orthologs in human, dog and pig . analysis of an in-house sheep est database revealed four ests  that align closely with both bsp30a and bsp30b. this indicates that homologs of bsp30a and/or b exist in a second ruminant species, the sheep, consistent with the possibility that the bsp <dig> gene expansion may have coincided with the radiation of ruminant species. further analyses are required to confirm this.

the analyses reported here raise some intriguing questions regarding the function of the bpi-like proteins. all of the greater family of bpi-like proteins characterised to date share a common biochemical property in binding complex lipids. these proteins have distinct sites of expression and diverse functions such as lipid transport and innate immunity. this and other reports  <cit>  show that most of the bpi-like proteins are most abundant in tissues associated with the oral cavity and airways. here we show that at least one family member is also expressed at a lower level in the digestive tract. it is likely the bpi-like proteins function in epithelial mucosa after being secreted.

the question of whether the bsp <dig> proteins have a similar lipid binding or bactericidal activity to that of bpi awaits experimental verification. in support of this, recombinant human psp has been reported to inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa  <cit> , and human plunc, has been shown to bind lps  <cit> . if these activities for the bsp <dig> proteins are confirmed, a possible biological role for them could be in modulating the microbial ecology in the bovine oral cavity so as to maintain optimal digestive function or prevent pathological infection. the results presented here suggest that the shape of the hydrophobic pocket may be important for determining functional differences among the bsp <dig> proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the bovine bpi-like locus of cattle features expansion of the single psp gene present in human and mouse into four distinct bsp <dig> genes. the dn/ds ratio data are consistent with evolutionary pressure for conservation of protein structure between all the orthologous pairs of bpi-like genes in cattle, human and mouse. however, this pressure is absent between the bsp <dig> genes, and the data suggests there is pressure for sequence divergence between bsp30c and the other bsp <dig> proteins. this, as well as its distinct expression profile, is consistent with bsp30c having acquired a distinct function from the other bsp <dig> proteins. the most likely biological role of the bpi-like proteins, including the bsp <dig> proteins, is as either detector or effector proteins in innate immune host defence  <cit> . while their precise biological roles are unknown, one can speculate that the bsp <dig> proteins may influence the host response to the commensal microbial ecosystem in cattle, including that of the rumen. bsp30a and b comprise approximately 30% of total salivary protein in cattle  <cit> , thus resulting in up to  <dig> g per day of bsp <dig> proteins being delivered into the rumen. a focus for future investigations is to determine whether the bsp <dig> gene duplications and subsequent divergence observed in cattle could have been a key step in the evolution of ruminants by facilitating adaptation to a ruminant lifestyle.
