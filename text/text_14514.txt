BACKGROUND
both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to the arterial inflammation that characterizes atherosclerosis  <cit> . mice lacking critical components of innate immunity, such as the toll-like receptor   <dig> and  <dig> and the tlr signaling protein myd <dig>  develop less atherosclerosis, indicating the involvement of pro-atherogenic endogenous tlr ligands  <cit> . the role of adaptive immunity in atherosclerosis is more complex. while there is strong evidence that th <dig> cells aggravate atherosclerosis  <cit>  the possible influence of th <dig> cells is less clear  <cit> . regulatory t cells   <cit>  and b cells  <cit>  appear to have protective functions. a common feature of the studies that have revealed these associations is that atherosclerosis has been induced by hypercholesterolemia. accordingly, it is likely that the immune responses that contributed to atherosclerosis development in these animals have been activated by ligands and antigens generated by hypercholesterolemia. the exact identity of these factors, as well as their mode of action, remains to be fully characterized. attention has focused on the role of oxidized low-density lipoprotein   <cit> . ldl particles become oxidized by various enzymes and oxygen metabolites when entrapped in the extra cellular matrix of the artery wall  <cit> . oxidized ldl is targeted by both igm and igg autoantibodies  <cit>  and as much as 10% of the t cells present in atherosclerotic plaques are specific for antigens formed in oxidized ldl  <cit> . t cells specific for oxidized ldl are also present in the circulation  <cit>  and transfer of cd4+ t cells isolated from mice immunized with aldehyde-modified ldl results in a more aggressive development of atherosclerosis  <cit>  providing direct evidence for a pathogenic role of adaptive immunity against modified ldl in the disease process. based on this knowledge attempts have been made to develop immunomodulatory therapy for prevention of cardiovascular disease and pilot vaccines containing apolipoprotein b  antigens have been shown to significantly reduce atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein e deficient  mice  <cit> . a limiting factor in the development of these therapies has been the poor understanding of the immune pathways activated by hypercholesterolemia  <cit> . in the present studies we aimed to address this issue by characterizing the induction of adaptive immunity to hypercholesterolemia both systemically and in regional lymph nodes draining lesion-prone areas of the aorta. we used apoe-/- mice in which a primary immune response to hypercholesterolemia-associated antigens, such as oxidized ldl, develops spontaneously  <cit> . to increase the antigen load we fed the mice a high-fat diet.

RESULTS
effect of diet on plasma lipids and atherosclerosis
apoe-/- mice fed high fat diet had twice as high plasma cholesterol levels as apoe-/- mice remaining on chow diet at week  <dig>  and week  <dig> . similarly, plasma hdl concentration was higher in mice fed high fat diet . triglyceride levels did not differ between the groups at  <dig> weeks  vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>   mg/dl, but were significantly lower in the high-fat group at  <dig> weeks . four weeks of high fat diet generated a more than two-fold increase in aortic root atherosclerotic plaque area as compared with chow diet . the plaque area remained significantly increased in the high-fat group after  <dig> weeks of diet  but the rate of progression between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks was approximately the same in both groups. the fraction of the plaque demonstrating positive immune-staining for oxidized ldl was similar in both groups and for both time points . the same was true for apo b immunoreactivity . these findings suggest that the effect of a more severe hypercholesterolemia on plaque growth was restricted to the first  <dig> weeks of diet.

t cell activation
to determine if hypercholesterolemia and plaque growth were associated with activation of adaptive immunity we analyzed t cell activation in the spleen and the mediastinal lymph nodes draining the aortic root, as well as brachial, axial, renal, iliac, and sacral lymph nodes, thymus and the circulation. the analysis focused on ifn-γ and il- <dig> secreted by polyclonally activated cd4+ and cd8+ t cells as depicted in figure  <dig>  we detected a diet-dependent immune response in spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes but not in any of the other tissues analyzed  which prompted us to focus the analysis on the two prior tissues.

t cell activation in plaque draining lymph nodes
in spite of a markedly enhanced plaque formation there was no evidence for increased activation of cd4+ cells in draining lymph nodes after  <dig> weeks of high-fat diet . the fraction of cd4+ expressing ifn-γ and il- <dig> was approximately equal. there was also no effect on cd4+cd25+foxp3+ natural tregs , cd4+cd28+ ifn-γ+ t cells  or cd8+ t cells . however, when the analysis was restricted to the cd28+ population of cd8+ t cells an increased expression of ifn-γ was observed in the high-fat group . there was no difference in total mediastinal lymph node cell numbers between the chow and high-fat groups at  <dig> weeks .

at the  <dig> week time point clear signs of cd4+ cell activation could be observed in the mediastinal lymph nodes. the fraction of cd4+ cells expressing ifn-γ was three-fold higher than the fraction of cd4+ cells expressing il- <dig> and the cd4+ expression of ifn-γ was higher in the high-fat group . the expression of ifn-γ remained elevated in cd8+cd28+ t cells , while no changes in the population of cd4+cd25+foxp3+ , cd4+cd28+ ifn-γ+  or cd8+ t cells were detected . the total mediastinal lymph node cell numbers was increased as compared to the  <dig> week time point, and there was also a further increase in cell numbers in the mice given high-fat diet .

t cell activation in the spleen
next we analyzed the systemic immune responses to hypercholesterolemia. after  <dig> weeks of high-fat diet the expression of il- <dig> was increased in spleen cd4+ cells, whereas no effect on cd4+ifn-γ+ , cd4+cd28+ ifn-γ expression  or cd4+cd25+foxp3+  populations were observed. the expression of both il- <dig> and ifn-γ was increased in spleen cd8+ cells  and the expression of ifn-γ was also increased in the cd8+cd28+ t cell population . the proliferative response to the polyclonal mitogen concanavalin a  was higher for cd8+ cells than for cd4+ cells in both groups and high-fat diet resulted in a further enhancement of the cd8+ cell proliferative response .

at  <dig> weeks il- <dig> expression remained elevated in cd4+ spleen cells from the high-fat group, but ifn-γ was now more frequently expressed than il- <dig> by cd4+ cells in both groups . we did not detect differences in cd4+cd25+foxp3+  or cd4+cd28+ ifn-γ+ . the cd8+ expression of ifn-γ was higher than at  <dig> weeks, but there was no longer any difference between the groups . however, the proliferative response of cd8+ cells to cona remained elevated in the high-fat group . in order to elucidate this discrepancy of cd8+ t cell cytokine production and proliferation we performed additional analyses studying the association between activation of dna synthesis, il- <dig> and ifn-γ expression in spleen cd <dig> t cells isolated from mice exposed to high-fat-diet. interestingly, the results demonstrated a strong association between dna synthesis and ifn-γ expression  along with a strong inverse association between dna synthesis and il- <dig> expression . these results suggest the induction of two distinct cd <dig> t cell phenotypes, one proliferative and pro-inflammatory and one quiescent and anti-inflammatory. to further asses the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the balance between th <dig> and th <dig> cells we analyzed the release of ifn-γ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> from cultured splenocytes exposed to cona. an increased capacity to express il- <dig> was only observed in mice given a high-fat diet for  <dig> weeks , whereas no effects were seen on cona-induced ifn-γ and il- <dig> secretion at any time point.

concentration of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn-γ in cell supernatant of cona stimulated splenocytes from mice fed chow or high fat diet for  <dig> or  <dig> weeks. **p <  <dig> .

antibody levels in plasma and atherosclerotic lesions
to assess the effect of increased plasma cholesterol levels on humoral immunity we determined plasma levels of apo b/igm and igg immune complexes, as well as autoantibodies against oxidized ldl and the oxidized ldl antigen mda-p <dig> . high-fat diet increased the level of plasma apo b/igm immune complexes as compared to chow , whereas the level of apo b/igg immune complexes were low and did not differ between the groups . plasma levels of igm against oxidized ldl and mda-p <dig> as well as igg against mda-p <dig> did not change in response to increased hypercholesterolemia  while the igm anti-oxldl titer of mice fed high fat diet for  <dig> weeks was markedly increased compared to mice fed chow diet for  <dig> weeks . the igg, igg <dig> and igg2c antibody plasma concentration against oxldl was below detection limit  and there was also no effect on the mda-p <dig> igg1/igg2a ratio . to determine if plaque size and oxldl accumulation affected the deposition of autoantibodies we stained aortic root lesions for presence of igm and igg antibodies. the fraction of igm or igg antibodies was not different in plaques from high-fat diet-fed apoe-/- mice compared to plaques from chow-fed apoe-/- mice  at any time point. since mice fed high fat diet develop larger plaques than chow fed mice, this suggests a reciprocal relationship between autoantibody deposition and plaque size.

discussion
it is well established that adaptive immune responses induced by hypercholesterolemia play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis  <cit> , but the pathways involved remain to be fully characterized. in the present study we assessed the response of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, as well as humoral immunity, to a high-fat diet. at  <dig> weeks the immune response to an aggravated hypercholesterolemia was found to involve expression of ifn-γ by cd8+cd28+ t cells in plaque-draining lymph nodes and in the spleen. at the latter location this pro-inflammatory response was counterbalanced by a concomitant release of il- <dig> from both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, whereas no induction of il- <dig> occurred in plaque-draining lymph nodes. however, following an extended  <dig> weeks of high-fat diet activation of cd4+ t cells could be observed also in draining lymph nodes. as opposed to the cd4+ t cells in the spleen that remained in a phenotype characterized by expression of il- <dig>  the mediastinal lymph node cd4+ t cells by then had differentiated into ifn-γ secreting th <dig> cells. our findings imply that when antigens generated in a hypercholesterolemic state are acquired systemically and presented to t cells in the spleen this results in differentiation of cd4+ t cells into il- <dig> producing th <dig> cells. this notion is in accordance with previous studies by zhou and coworkers demonstrating that diet-induced hypercholesterolemia is associated with a switch in oxidized ldl-specific igg towards a th <dig> isotype  <cit> . our observation of an increased capacity of splenocytes from mice given high-fat diet to secrete il- <dig> is also in accordance with a hypercholesterolemia-dependent shift towards th <dig>  in contrast, when antigens generated by hypercholesterolemia are acquired in atherosclerotic lesions and presented to t cells in draining lymph nodes this results in activation of th <dig> cells. the reason why antigens generated by hypercholesterolemia activates a th <dig> response systemically but a th <dig> immune response when acquired by antigen presenting cells  in atherosclerotic lesions remains to be elucidated. one possibility could be that the pro-inflammatory environment of the atherosclerotic plaque activates apc to express co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines in a manner that subsequently primes naïve t cells in draining lymph nodes to th <dig> differentiation. supporting this notion, dendritic cells pulsed with oxldl aggravate atherosclerosis or are atheroprotective depending on the priming environment. habets et al. used infused dcs pulsed with copper-oxidized ldl into ldlr-/- hosts which reduced carotid lesion size and increased plaque stability  <cit> . on the contrary, mda-ldl pulsed dcs aggravated atherosclerosis in apoe-/- mice  <cit> . interestingly, immunization with mda-ldl in complete freunds adjuvant is atheroprotective  <cit> , indicating that ex vivo primed dcs generate a pro-inflammatory response whereas in vivo primed dcs are anti-inflammatory. gautier et al. reported that dcs in apoe-/- and ldlr-/- mice are th <dig> and th <dig> disposed, while removal of dcs increase hypercholesterolemia, further supporting the dual role of dcs in atherosclerosis  <cit> . since the capability of dcs to prime cd4+ t cells is equivalent in normo- and hypercholesterolemic mice  <cit> , dcs may initiate the th <dig> priming associated with aggravated atherosclerosis as well as the th <dig> response present in splenocytes of mice given high fat diet. it is also possible that th <dig> priming of cd4+ t cells in the mediastinal lymph node could be aided by the ifn-γ secreting cd8+ cd28+ t cells that develop in draining lymph nodes prior to the occurrence of cd4+ th <dig> cells.

an unexpected finding in the present study was that the initial pro-inflammatory response to hypercholesterolemia was started by cd8+ t cells and not by cd4+ t cells. the role of cd8+ t cells in atherosclerosis has not been extensively studied. cd8+ t cells are present in atherosclerotic lesions of apoe-/- mice, but are less frequent than cd4+ t cells  <cit> . however, in advanced human lesions the cd8+ t cells may account for up to 50% of the entire leukocyte population  <cit> . targeting of a cd8+ t cell immune response against arterial smooth muscle cells has been shown to markedly aggravate atherosclerosis in apoe-/- mice  <cit> . cd8+ t cells have also been implicated in the accelerated atherosclerosis that occurs in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> . in a study by elhage and coworkers  <cit>  cd <dig> deficiency did not influence atherosclerosis development in apoe-/- mice. however, in the same study it was unexpectedly found that deficiency of cd <dig> increased plaque formation. the authors concluded that this could be due to the expansion of cd8+ t cell population that characterizes cd4-/- mice.

our findings do not permit any clear conclusion regarding the antigen responsible for hypercholesterolemia-induced immune activation. it is generally assumed that oxidized ldl is a dominant autoantigen generated by hypercholesterolemia  <cit> . in agreement with previous studies oxidized ldl igg and igm autoantibodies were present in chow-fed apoe-/- mice  <cit>  and the levels did not change significantly in response to high-fat diet. in contrast, mice fed a high-fat diet were found to have higher levels of apo b/igm immune complexes in the circulation which could reflect an increase in the amount of circulating oxidized ldl as well as an enhanced generation of anti-oxidized ldl igm. there was however no change in the anti-oxldl igg1/igg2c ratio. this observation is in contrast to studies by zhou et al.  <cit>  demonstrating a shift towards th <dig> isotype anti-oxidized ldl igg in severe hypercholesterolemia. the reason for this discrepancy remains to be clarified but may involve the difference in antigens used in the elisas. however, the observation that high-fat diet increased the capacity of splenocytes to secrete il- <dig> suggests that hypercholesterolemia stimulated a shift towards th <dig> also in the present study. in order to further develop the assay, it would be interesting to determine if the origin of il- <dig> production is cd4+ or cd8+ t cell specific. an important limitation that should be kept in mind when interpreting the present findings is that mouse models of atherosclerosis may not be entirely representative of the pathophysiology of human atherosclerosisis  <cit> . moreover, it is also unlikely that the sudden increase in plasma cholesterol levels observed in response to high fat diet in the present study would occur in humans. nevertheless, in spite of these limitations, our findings provide support for a role of cd8+ t cells in immune responses activated by hypercholesterolemia.

the accumulation of oxidized ldl in atherosclerotic lesions was correlated to lesion size. in spite of this there were no signs of activation of cd4+ t cells in draining lymph nodes  <dig> weeks after diet change, suggesting a lack of reactivity against extracellular antigens such as oxidized ldl. the observation of increased ifn-γ expression in cd8+cd28+ t cells instead point to an initial immune response against cell antigens. although immune responses against apoptotic cells generally are tolerogenic and inhibit atherosclerosis  <cit>  it can not be excluded that this represents an immune response against damaged vascular cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion the present observations demonstrate that hypercholesterolemia leads to activation of an unopposed th <dig> immune response in lymph nodes draining atherosclerotic plaques, whereas this response in the spleen is balanced by a concomitant activation of il- <dig> expressing th <dig> cells. they also show that cd8+ t cells may have an equally important role as cd4+ t cells in hypercholesterolemia-induced immune activation implicating generation of cellular autoantigens.
