BACKGROUND
respiratory epithelium acts as the first tissue to meet inhaled pathogens and is capable of releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines in response. respiratory epithelial cells can synthesize and secrete a variety of proinflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor   <cit>  and rantes  <cit>  which regulate cell behavior including growth, secretion, migration in physiological and pathological conditions.

the importance of serine proteinases in the development of airway diseases has been emphasized in recent years. of particular importance is that the potential role of tryptase  <cit>  thrombin  <cit>  and elastase  <cit>  in the development of asthma, in which these serine proteinases were not only been over-secreted  <cit> , but also found to play a role in induction of cytokine hypersecretion in airways  <cit> . however, the potential mechanism, through which these serine proteinases carry out their actions in respiratory tract, remains unclear. since increased level of il- <dig> in the airways reported to be closely correlated to asthma  <cit> , we investigated the effect of tryptase, thrombin, trypsin, and elastase on il- <dig> secretion and gene expression in a <dig> cells, a type ii alveolar epithelial cell line from human adenocarcinoma, in the present study.

in recent years, pars have been identified as receptors for serine proteinases. among them, par- <dig> is a receptor of thrombin and trypsin  <cit> ; par- <dig> is a receptor of trypsin, tryptase  <cit>  and elastase  <cit> ; par- <dig>  <cit>  and par- <dig>  <cit>  are receptors of thrombin. activation of pars could profoundly alter secretion ability of numerous cell types such as histamine release from human mast cells  <cit> , il- <dig> release from airway epithelial cells  <cit> , il- <dig> release from fibroblast  <cit> , and il- <dig> release from human oral epithelial cells  <cit> . we therefore investigated the effect of the agonists of all four types of pars on il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells in the current study. since expression of pars on a <dig> cells is crucial for the understanding of actions of the serine proteinases tested, we also investigated the expression par- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig> on a <dig> cells with immunocytochemical techniques and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  in the present study.

RESULTS
induction of il- <dig> release by serine proteinases
thrombin at concentrations of 1– <dig> u/ml provokes a concentration dependent release of il- <dig> from a <dig> cells following  <dig> h incubation period. approximately  <dig> fold increase in il- <dig> release is observed at  <dig> h following incubation with  <dig> u/ml thrombin . the time course study shows that increased release of il- <dig> induced by thrombin begins within  <dig> h, and lasts at least to  <dig> h .

at the concentrations from  <dig> to  <dig> ng/ml, trypsin is able to stimulate a 'bell shape' release of il- <dig> from a <dig> cells following  <dig> h incubation period. the maximum release of  <dig>  fold is observed when  <dig> ng/ml of trypsin was added to a <dig> cells. at the time of  <dig> h, however, a dose dependent release of il- <dig> from a <dig> cells is achieved with  <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml trypsin. small but nevertheless significant release of il- <dig> is also observed with  <dig> ng/ml trypsin following  <dig> h incubation . also in figure  <dig>  it is clearly observed that the basal accumulated secretion of il- <dig> from a <dig> cells is time dependent with  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> pg/ml being secreted following  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h incubation periods, respectively. trypsin at concentration of  <dig> ng/ml fails to stimulate il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion from a <dig> cells following  <dig> h incubation period .

tryptase at the concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml induces a concentration dependent il- <dig> secretion from a <dig> cells. approximately  <dig>  fold increase in release of il- <dig> is observed when  <dig> μg/ml of tryptase was incubated with cells for  <dig> h, and as little as  <dig>  μg/ml tryptase is able to provoke a significant release of il- <dig> from a <dig> cell at  <dig> h following incubation . time course study reveals that increased release of il- <dig> induced by tryptase begins within  <dig> h, and lasts at least to  <dig> h . elastase, however, only at the concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml elicits significant release of il- <dig> following  <dig> h incubation period, and the quantity of il- <dig> released from a <dig> cells in response to  <dig>  μg/ml elastase is similar to that induced by  <dig> μg/ml of tryptase . time course study shows that elastase induced release of il- <dig> occurs after  <dig> h incubation and maintains at least to  <dig> h .

inhibition of il- <dig> release induced by proteinases by their inhibitors
hirudin, a specific thrombin inhibitor is able to inhibit thrombin-induced secretion of il- <dig> at both  <dig> and  <dig> h following incubation. the maximum inhibition of approximately 89% is observed when  <dig> u/ml of hirudin was added to cells for  <dig> h . similarly, specific trypsin inhibitors sbti and α1-antitrysin are able to completely abolish trypsin-induced secretion of il- <dig> at both  <dig> and  <dig> h following incubation . it is observed also that msack, an inhibitor of elastase completely abrogates elastase induced release of il- <dig> . in contrast, inhibitors of tryptase, benzamine and leupeptine are only able to inhibit tryptase induced il- <dig> secretion by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively following  <dig> h incubation . hirudin , sbti, and α1-antitrysin , benzamidine, leupeptine and msack  alone at the concentrations tested have little effect on il- <dig> secretion from a <dig> cells.

data shown are mean ± se for five separate experiments. thrombin, hirudin, and thrombin with hirudin were added to cells for  <dig> h or  <dig> h. *p <  <dig>  compared with the corresponding concentration of thrombin alone.

data shown are mean ± se for five separate experiments. trypsin, inhibitor, and trypsin with inhibitor were added to cells for  <dig> h or  <dig> h. * p <  <dig>  compared with the corresponding concentration of trypsin alone. α1-at = α1-antitrypsin, sbti = soybean trypsin inhibitor, nd = not done.

data shown are mean ± se for five to six separate experiments. stimulus, inhibitor, or stimulus with inhibitor was incubated with cells for  <dig> h. * p <  <dig>  compared with the response to medium alone; †p <  <dig>  compared with the corresponding stimulus alone.

expression of pars by a <dig> cells
facs analysis shows that a <dig> cells express all four pars regardless they are permeabilized or not . immunofluorescent cell staining shows that par- <dig> seems mainly stained on the membrane surface of a <dig> cells, whereas par- <dig>  par- <dig> and particularly par- <dig> predominately stained in cytoplasm . an agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that a <dig> cells express mrnas for all four pars . the amplified rt-pcr products of par- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig> mrnas were sequenced and they all correspond to published sequences of par genes .

induction of il- <dig> release by agonists of pars
sfllr-nh <dig>  a specific par- <dig> agonist peptide stimulats a concentration dependent secretion of il- <dig> from a <dig> cells following  <dig> h incubation , whereas its reverse peptide rllfs-nh <dig> has no effect on il- <dig> release. the maximum release of il- <dig> is  <dig>  fold induced by  <dig> μm of sfllr-nh <dig> following  <dig> h incubation period . however, tfrgap-nh <dig>  an agonist peptide of par- <dig> and its reverse peptide pagrft-nh <dig> at concentrations  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm do not show any influence on il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells following  <dig> h incubation period . the time course study shows that sfllr-nh <dig> induced release of il- <dig> occurs after  <dig> h incubation and sustains at least until  <dig> h .

while sligkv-nh <dig> and tc-ligrlo-nh <dig>  two specific agonists of par- <dig> induce concentration dependent secretion of il- <dig> from a <dig> cells following  <dig> and  <dig> h incubation periods  only tc-ligrlo-nh <dig> is able to stimulate il- <dig> release at  <dig> h . the maximum release of il- <dig> is approximately  <dig> and  <dig>  fold over baseline induced by  <dig> μm of tc-ligrlo-nh <dig> at  <dig> h and  <dig> μm of sligkv-nh <dig> at  <dig> h, respectively. vkgils-nh <dig> has little effect on il- <dig> release, but tc-olrgil-nh <dig> appears to induce a significant release il- <dig> from a <dig> cells. however, the extent of release of il- <dig> induced by tc-olrgil-nh <dig> is much less than that induced by tc-ligrlo-nh <dig> . sligkv-nh <dig> and tc-ligrlo-nh <dig> at concentration of  <dig> μm fail to stimulate il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> secretion from a <dig> cells following  <dig> h incubation period .

at a concentration of  <dig> μm, gypgqv-nh <dig>  an agonist peptide of par- <dig> induces a  <dig>  fold increase in il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells. however, at a higher concentration , it stimulates less il- <dig> secretion . vqgpyg-nh <dig>  a reverse peptide of gypgqv-nh <dig>  at the concentrations tested does not show any influence on il- <dig> release . the time course study shows that gypgqv-nh <dig> induced release of il- <dig> occurs after  <dig> h incubation and sustains at least until  <dig> h .

effect of serine proteinases and agonists of pars on expression of il- <dig> mrna in a <dig> cells
thrombin, trypsin, tryptase and elastase stimulate an increase in expression of il- <dig> mrna in a <dig> cells when they were incubated with the cells. however, the tryptase induced up-regulation of expression of il- <dig> mrna only lasts for  <dig> h, whereas thrombin, trypsin  and elastase provoked expression of il- <dig> mrna continues until  <dig> h. up to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold increase in expression of il- <dig> mrna is observed with thrombin, trypsin, tryptase and elastase, respectively following incubation with a <dig> cells . dramatically enhanced expression of il- <dig> mrna is found when sfllr-nh <dig>  sligkv-nh <dig> or tc-ligrlo-nh <dig> was incubated with a <dig> cells for  <dig> h. at  <dig> and  <dig> h following incubation, however, il- <dig> mrna expression induced by sfllr-nh <dig>  sligkv-nh <dig> or tc-ligrlo-nh <dig> is greatly decreased . gypgqv-nh <dig> and tfrgap-nh <dig> at  <dig> μm has little influence on il- <dig> mrna expression in a <dig> cells . at the concentration of  <dig> μm, rllfs-nh <dig>  vkgils-nh <dig>  tc-olrgil-nh <dig>  pagrft-nh <dig> and vqgpyg-nh <dig>  the reverse peptides of agonists of pars have little effect on il- <dig> mrna expression in a <dig> cells .

discussion
it is demonstrated that human serine proteinases including thrombin, tryptase, elastase and trypsin are potent stimuli of il- <dig> secretion from a <dig> cells, which suggests that they are likely to play a role in il- <dig> related airway inflammatory disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis.

as little as  <dig>  nm of thrombin is able to stimulate approximately  <dig> fold increase in il- <dig> secretion, and  <dig> nm of thrombin induces  <dig> fold increase in il- <dig> release, indicating that this proteinase is a potent secretagogue of il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells. human mast cell tryptase, an established mediator of inflammation  <cit>  at a concentration as low as  <dig>  nm induces twice more il- <dig> secretion over baseline release, and trypsin, a potential mediator of airway inflammation  <cit>  at a concentration of  <dig>  nm provokes approximately  <dig> fold increase in il- <dig> secretion from a <dig> cells, suggesting that tryptic enzyme in airways may play a role in stimulation of il- <dig> hypersecretion from airway epithelium. similarly, elastase, a well-established mediator of airway inflammation at a concentration of  <dig>  nm elicits  <dig> -fold increase in il- <dig> release, indicating that it is a potent secretagogue of il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells as well. at a concentration of  <dig> nm, elastase was also found to be able to induce il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> secretion from human gingival fibroblasts  <cit> . however, at the concentrations higher than  <dig>  nm elastase could disarm par- <dig> within  <dig> min following incubation with human lung epithelial cells  <cit> . these findings suggest that elastase at lower concentrations induce cytokine release from a <dig> cells, but at higher concentrations may inactivate par- <dig> on human lung epithelial cells including a <dig> cells. it was impossible for us to examine the effect of elastase at the concentrations higher than  <dig>  nm with our experimental system as at the concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml , elastase was able to dissociate a <dig> cells from plate after  <dig> h incubation and the suspended cells died soon after . this phenomenon may explain the reason for which elastase at the concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml fails to enhance il- <dig> release. the similar phenomenon is also observed with trypsin at the concentrations higher than  <dig> μg/ml. these findings implicate that the detachment of bronchial epithelium observed in chronic airway inflammation may result from the hydrolytic activities of elastase and trypsin. time course study shows that il- <dig> release induced by thrombin, tryptase and trypsin initiates within  <dig> h following incubation, whereas the response to elastase occurs only after  <dig> h incubation period. this indicates that elastase and the other proteinases tested may adopt different mechanisms in induction of il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells. the concentrations of tryptase and elastase used in the present study should be achievable under pathological conditions as the level of tryptase in asthmatic bronchial alveolar lavage fluid was  <dig>  ng/ml  <cit>  and the levels of elastase in asthmatic and cystic fibrosis sputum were  <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml, respectively  <cit> . while information on the levels of thrombin and trypsin in respiratory fluids are not available, a report described that trypsin-like activity was  <dig>  mu/ml in mucoid sputum from patients with asthma  <cit>  might implicate that the concentrations of thrombin and trypsin used in the current study ought to be achievable in the inflammatory airways.

a <dig> cells have been reported to secrete some  <dig> pg/ml of elafin and  <dig> ng/ml of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor  following  <dig> h incubation  <cit> . this concentration of elafin, an inhibitor of elastase should not affect the action of elastase on a <dig> cells, but the concentrations of slpi, an inhibitor of trypsin and elastase may reduce the stimulatory action of the lower concentrations of trypsin or elastase on a <dig> cells.

hirudin inhibites approximately 87% thrombin induced il- <dig> secretion; sbti and α1-antitrypsin completely abolish trypsin induced il- <dig> secretion and msack eliminats 97% elastase induced il- <dig> secretion, suggesting strongly that the actions of these proteinases on a <dig> cells are dependent upon their intact catalytic sites. since the known substrates of these proteinases on cells are pars, the expression of pars on a <dig> cells was investigated in the present study. to our surprise, benzamidine and leupeptine at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml , trypsin, tryptase and elastase cleavages par- <dig> at the site of skgr34↓s35ligkv, thrombin also cleavages par- <dig> at the site lpik38↓t39frgap and par- <dig> at papr47↓g48ypgqv  <cit> . synthetic receptor-activating peptides corresponding to the new amino termini of the cleaved receptors can also activate pars  <cit> . thus, sfllr-nh <dig>  <cit> , sligkv-nh <dig>  <cit>  and tc-ligrlo-nh <dig>  <cit> , tfrgap-nh <dig>  <cit> , gypgqv-nh <dig>  <cit>  represented agonists of par- <dig>  par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig>  respectively in the current study. for comparison, their reverse peptides were used as controls.

sfllr-nh <dig>  tc-ligrlo-nh <dig>  sligkv-nh <dig> and gypgqv-nh <dig> stimulates approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  fold increase in release of il- <dig>  implicating that there are appropriate mechanisms to carry out il- <dig> release process in response to par- <dig>  par- <dig> and par- <dig> activation in a <dig> cells. however, a <dig> cells do not show any response  to par- <dig> activation. activation of a <dig> cells to release il- <dig> by agonists of pars indicates that the actions of thrombin, tryptase, elastase and trypsin on a <dig> cells are most likely carried out through hydrolytic cleavage of n-termini of pars. the time course shows that the influence of agonists of par- <dig> and par- <dig> on a <dig> cells initiates within  <dig> h following incubation, but the action of agonist of par- <dig> on cells appears only after  <dig> h incubation. these observations suggest that the actions of thrombin on a <dig> cells are mainly  carried out through par- <dig>  but not par- <dig>  whereas the influence of trypsin on cells is most likely through both par- <dig> and par- <dig>  it is hard to understand the slower response of cells to elastase and at least partially enzymatic activity independent actions of tryptase on a <dig> cells. these obviously require further investigation. using various concentrations of agonist peptides of pars to stimulate a <dig> cells may better reflect the actions of these peptides on the cells, which reinforces the previous finding  <cit> .

up-regulation of expression of il- <dig> gene in a <dig> cells by thrombin, trypsin, tryptase, elastase, par- <dig> and par- <dig> agonist peptides indicates that il- <dig> released from a <dig> cells induced by these stimuli is most likely being newly generated, rather than pre-stored in the cells. the observation that relatively small quantity of il- <dig> was released during the first  <dig> h of incubation in response to the above stimuli also supports our view. while the influence of tryptase and trypsin on il- <dig> gene expression does not appear to have been studied previously, the report which found elastase  <cit>  and thrombin  <cit>  up-regulated il- <dig> gene expression in human epithelial cells may support our current findings. to our knowledge, this is the first work examining il- <dig> gene expression in response to several serine proteinases in epithelial cells under the same conditions. the parallel investigation of the actions of serine proteinases on a <dig> cells may contribute to easier understanding of the role of these proteinases in regulation of il- <dig> gene expression. it is difficult to understand the reason why gypgqv-nh <dig> does not significantly up-regulate il- <dig> gene expression, but stimulates il- <dig> release from a <dig> cells at  <dig> h following incubation. it could be that the significantly increased il- <dig> gene expression occurs between  <dig> and  <dig> h incubation period, but we did not examine it.

induction of inflammatory mediator release from airway epithelial cells by agonists of pars has been demonstrated previously. thus, agonist of par- <dig> stimulated platelet-derived growth factor secretion from lung epithelial cells  <cit> ; agonists of par- <dig> stimulated il- <dig> secretion from  <dig> hbe cells  <cit> , gm-csf and eotaxin release from human pulmonary epithelial cells  <cit>  and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> release from a <dig> and primary cultured small airway epithelial cells  <cit> , and agonist of par- <dig> stimulated il- <dig> secretion from human respiratory epithelial cells  <cit> .

our findings further strengthen the view that through activation of pars, serine proteinases are actively involved in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation.

however, since a <dig> cells is not a normal airway epithelial cells, it may not fully represent the events happening in normal airway epithelial cells in response to the stimuli above in real life.

CONCLUSIONS
serine proteinases tested are potent stimuli of il- <dig> secretion from a <dig> cells, and the influence of these proteinases on airway epithelial cells are most likely through activation of pars. induction of il- <dig> secretion by proteinases indicates that they are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of airway inflammatory disorders.

development of proteinase inhibitor drugs may be valuable for treatment of these diseases.
