BACKGROUND
superoxide dismutases  are ubiquitous enzyme present in plants, animals and microbes and acts as the first line of defense against the toxic effects of superoxide   <cit> .these metallo-enzymes catalyze the dismutation of o2∙− radicals to yield molecular oxygen  and hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . based on the metal ion cofactor identified in their active site, three types of sods  are reported to be present in the plant cell. amongst these, cuzn-sods are the most prominent form, and its isoforms have been reported to be present in cytosol, chloroplast, peroxisomes, and in extracellular location also  <cit> . in chloroplast, the cuzn -sod serves as an important component of water–water cycle and hence prevents plant from photo-oxidative injury  <cit> .

the chloroplastic cuzn-sod display significant differences with cytosolic sods in terms of their amino acid composition, spectral characteristics, sensitivity towards h2o <dig>  and immunological properties  <cit> . the two isozymes are believed to evolved independently and diverged at very early stage of its acquisition  <cit> . in plant species like arabidopsis thaliana, mustard, bean and citrus fe-sod is a major sod isoform in the leaf, indicating that fe-sod alone could remove superoxide from photosynthesis process. yet, in pea, the level of fe-sod is much lower as compared to chloroplastic cuzn-sod, which could indicate that in these group of plants, chloroplastic cuzn-sod is primarily involved in protecting chloroplasts from o <dig> - mediated damage of photosynthetic machinery  <cit> .

except few cases, eukaryotic cuzn-sods are generally homodimeric, consisting of two identical subunits with one copper  and one zinc  ion per subunit  <cit> . the two subunits are held together by hydrophobic interaction and the arrangement of amino acids is conserved at the dimer interface  <cit> . the three dimensional structure is characterized by a β-barrel structure composed of eight β-sheets with three loops, which are connected through disulfide bridge. the content of α-helical structure accounts for 5% only, exclusive to loop region. the active copper ion is solvent exposed and serves as redox partner for o2∙−, whereas the zinc ion is buried inside the β-barrel and is crucial for stabilization of its structure  <cit> . cuzn-sods are believed to be one of the most stable globular protein families studied so far. they retain the native structure in 8 m urea, 4% sds, has a melting temperature as high as 80°c and are also resistant to proteolytic degradation  <cit> . several factors contribute to the enzyme’s exceptional stability, including the close packing of hydrophobic interfaces in the dimeric eukaryotic enzymes, the tight packing of the eight stranded β -barrel scaffold, the presence of an intra-chain disulfide bridge and the stabilizing effect of metal cofactors  <cit> . in spite of the stringent conservation of the three dimensional structure displayed by all the eukaryotic cuzn-sods, enzymes isolated from various natural sources often exhibit difference in their kinetic properties and stability  <cit> . the study of the molecular determinants that are responsible for those differences could provide hints to understand factors governing protein stability and activity.

the heterologous expression of cuzn-sods in bacteria and yeast often results in the impairment of recombinant protein activity  <cit> . this may be due to formation of apo-protein and/or improper folding of the protein in its recombinant form. nevertheless, the overexpression studies are usually accompanied by supplementation of copper and zinc in growth medium  <cit> . in yeast, copper regulates the expression of cytosolic cuzn-sod at both transcriptional and post-translational levels, while there is no copper-mediated transcriptional regulation of cuzn-sod in human cells and higher plants, instead there is a translational and/or post-translational mechanism for cuzn-sod activation  <cit> .

sod is a unique enzyme which can eliminate o2∙− and therefore the enzyme is widely used in parenteral administrative in case of various diseases principally related to oxidative stress like musculoskeletal inflammation, alzheimer disease, crohon’s disease, intestinal fat absorption, and as an anti-inflammatory agent  <cit> . it is also used as an oral administration for radiation therapy, treating ulcers in the eye cornea and for reducing aging symptoms such as wrinkles etc.  <cit> . thus, importance of sod has been acknowledged worldwide in pharmaceutical industries and there are various efforts to develop more efficient and stable enzyme and improvement of in vivo pharmacological activity of sod by conjugating with polysaccharides, hemoglobin and lecithin  <cit> .

in the present study, we describe the recombinant expression and biochemical characterization of a highly active chloroplastic cuzn-sod from pisum sativum  in e. coli expression system. the bacterial growth conditions were optimized for the recovery of maximum protein in the enzymatically active  form. the recombinantly purified protein was further examined for its spectral and biochemical characteristics. the protein displays very high activity , and remains active under a broad range of phs. the enzyme is stable to proteolytic digestion and 50% of its original activity is retained even after storing for 180 days at room temperature . owing to the properties mentioned above, the recombinant pschsod may find its utility in the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. it may also be valuable for producing transgenic plants that need additional tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . thus, the present study provides an excellent strategy to produce recombinant cuzn-sod in its highly active and stable form.

RESULTS
pcr amplification and cloning of pschsod
to obtain the sequence of pschsod without ‘chloroplast transit peptide’, internal primers were synthesized and specific product was pcr amplified using pea cdna library as template. amplified product was cloned into primary vector pgem-t easy and confirmed by colony pcr and restriction digestion . to check the authenticity of insert, pschsod clones were sequenced and matched for any mutation. later, for heterologous protein expression, pschsod gene was cloned into pet-28a vector . after confirming the right clone, pschsod -pet-28a was transformed into protein expression strain i.e. bl <dig> . transformed colonies obtained were checked for protein induction by iptg .

growth culture condition optimization for overexpression and purification of protein
the production of properly folded native protein in escherichia coli  is often challenging due to aggregation of the overexpressed protein into inclusion bodies. nevertheless, formation of recombinant proteins in soluble fraction  is favored at lower temperature  <cit> . in this case, the formation of recombinant protein was relatively higher at 37°c  as compared to 18°c , but a large amount of protein goes to inclusion body at 37°c . however, at 18°c most fraction of the protein remains in soluble fraction. when induced at 37°c, the amount of native  pschsod protein, obtained with the purification procedure was ~  <dig>  mg l− <dig> of culture volume with bacterial wet biomass was about ~ 5 g l− <dig>  while induction at 18°c resulted in ~ 4 mg l− <dig> of culture volume with bacterial wet biomass was about ~  <dig>  g l− <dig> . therefore, 18°c was selected for further expression study and overexpression of the protein.table  <dig>

the prosthetic copper and zinc are essential component of cuzn-sods. therefore, the effect of copper  and zinc  on the expression of pschsod was investigated by exogenous supplementation of cu  and zn  in the culture medium following induction with iptg. the added concentration  of each of these compounds does not interfere with the viability of bacterial cells as reflected in od <dig> and cfu counting . although, supplementation of copper has no effect on the overexpression of pschsod in soluble form but zinc results in the increase in protein expression . however, addition of copper causes a nearly 10-fold increase of sod activity, as observed in both crude extract and ni-nta purified protein samples . thus, the concentration of both copper and zinc used here is not toxic to the recombinant bl <dig> cells and can be suitably used to over express pschsod. it has been previously suggested that, copper and zinc supplementation in growth media can cause transcriptional and translational activation of cuzn-sod, when overexpressed in bacteria, yeast and plants  <cit> .

the purified recombinant protein was obtained with a stepwise combination of ni-nta affinity chromatography, desalting and buffer exchange with zeba desalting columns  <cit> . the homogeneity of the purified proteins was examined on 15% sds-page. copper and zinc quantity as determined from icp-ms, zincon and bathocuproine were found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively per dimer of the recombinant pschsod as compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for bovine cuzn-sod. the results of the analysis of metal content by icp-ms, zincon and bathocuproine protocol has been shown in table  <dig>  there is no significant fe/mn/ ni present in the recombinant pschsod. icp-ms analysis shows that copper and zinc content was found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively per dimer of the recombinant pschsod as compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the commercially available bovine cuzn-sod. copper content of pschsod determined by zincon and bathocuproeine was found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively as compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for bovine sod.table  <dig>

determination of native and subunit molecular weight
gel filtration chromatography of pschsod shows a distinct single retention profile, corresponding to 36–38 kda molecular mass . however, the 15% sds-page analysis suggest that the sub-unit size pschsod is ~18 kda . western blot analysis by using both monoclonal anti-his antibody and polyclonal anti-cuzn-sod, confirms the presence of histidine tag in recombinant protein corresponding to the ~18 kda molecular marker . these results suggest that the recombinant his-tagged pschsod maintains its dimeric form in native condition during its recombinant synthesis.figure  <dig> 
molecular mass of purified pschsod and spectral analysis.  native molecular mass of recombinant pschsod was measured with respect to standard protein marker as resolved in biosil- <dig> analytical gel filtration column. standard proteins used were:  160 kda-glucose oxidase   <dig>  kda-bsa fraction v  29 kda-carbonic anhydrase and  16 kda-bovine cuzn sod  respectively . the 15% sds–page showing pschsod subunit. subunit molecular mass as calculated using the molecular standard markers suggest that the subunit mass of the protein is ~ 18 kda.western blot taking1μg of the protein and probed with poly-his antibody has been shown in  while probed using cuzn-sod specific antibody has been depicted in .  room temperature  uv-visible electronic transition spectra of 2 mg ml− <dig> pschsod. the inset depicts the spectral resolution in an extended scale showing prominent broad peak at 670 nm, characteristics of d-d transition for copper in cuzn-sods. cd spectral analysis of the protein at 25°c is represented in . negative band at 208 nm region and positive band at 196 nm is shown which suggest abundance of β-sheet in the protein.



spectroscopic characterization
the recombinant pschsod, display multiple electronic transition maxima referring to phenylalanine transitions at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 268 nm and a shoulder at 278–280 nm . these characteristics absorptions may be indicative of reduced quantity of tyrosine and tryptophan residues, as reported for other plant cuzn-sods  <cit> . deduced amino acid sequence from the cdna, also corroborate this argument, where a single tyrosine residue is present at 98th position.

the spectrum in the visible region showed an electronic transition at around 670 nm . although, the maxima of d-d transition for cu2+ co-ordination of chloroplastic cuzn-sod is generally peaks at 680 nm  <cit> , the 10 nm blue shift of this maxima in recombinant pschsod suggest that the ligand environment of the prosthetic copper ion is different, resembling the cytosolic type of cuzn-sod in its ligand to protein interaction.

circular dichroism  spectrum of pschsod  was analyzed in 190–240 nm regions. a prominent negative band at 208–210 nm regions was discernible indicating the presence of small amount of α- helix but with high percentage of β-sheet content similar to human and other eukaryotic sods  <cit> . cd spectra of chloroplast and cytosol cuzn-sods from spinach also show similar spectral resolution  <cit> . thus, it appears that the pschsod conserves the β -barrel structure of the cuzn-sods in its recombinant form.

measurement of pschsod superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity
superoxide dismutase specific activity of pschsod, assayed by pyrogallol method was calculated to be  <dig> - <dig>  unitsmg− <dig> of protein ; an activity not reported in literature hitherto. this span of variation was noted from four different individual preparation of the recombinant protein . on comparative basis, the observed activity was recorded to be nearly 6-fold higher than the activity reported for commercial protein . in addition to the usual superoxide dismutation activity, cuzn-sod has also a peroxidative function, where the enzyme utilizes its own dismutation product, the h2o <dig> in presence of bicarbonate  <cit> . bicarbonate mediated peroxidase activity was measured as increase in 2′, 7′ dichlorfluorescein  fluorescence intensity with increasing concentration of protein and compared with the activity obtained using commercial cuzn-sod . the peroxidase activity of the enzyme was also found to be nearly 5-fold higher than the commercial bovine cuzn-sod .figure  <dig> 
measurement of superoxide dismutase  and peroxidase activity of pschsod and effect of inhibitors on sod activity.  evaluation of sod activity by pyrogallol assay with increasing protein concentrations of pschsod. specific activity  of the protein was calculated in the linear range of superoxide scavenging activity and displayed in the figure inset.  peroxidase activity of pschsod measured as increase in relative 2′, 7′-dichlorfluorescein  fluorescence with increasing protein concentration . comparative assessment of peroxidase activity with bovine cuzn-sod is represented as the relative dcf fluorescence at emission maxima  under 480 nm excitation in . closed circle  represents the pschsod while open circle  with solid line represents bovine sod. inhibitors tested were  sodium azide  potassium cyanide  diethyldithiocarbamate and  hydrogen peroxide. the residual sod activity was determined taking  <dig> unit of sod as 100%. potassium cyanide and diethyldithiocarbamate acts immediately on cuzn-sod while for sodium azide and hydrogen peroxide, pschsod was incubated at desired concentration for 20 min at 37°c and assayed for residual activity.



inhibitor studies on pschsod activity
results on the effect of various inhibitors on the pschsod activity have been shown in figure 2d-g. the recombinant enzyme was least affected by sodium azide , as only 40% of native activity was inactivated by 50 mm potassium cyanide . addition of 5 mm of hydrogen peroxide  completely inhibited of the enzyme activity. kcn was also able to inhibit 100% of the activity at very low concentration , while diethyldithiocarbamate  could completely abolish the enzyme activity at 1400 μm.

in general, the cuzn sods purified from various sources exhibit a wide range of susceptibility to inhibitors like nan <dig>  kcn and h2o <dig>  <cit> . ddc and kcn are specific inhibitors for cuzn-sods and required relatively lesser concentrations to cease enzyme activity and the inhibition is also instant. however, nan <dig> and h2o <dig> mediated inhibition is slow and requires higher concentrations for complete inhibition.

effect of ph and temperature on activity and stability of pschsod
the effect of incubation temperature on pschsod activity was studied and the results are shown in figure 3a. the enzyme activity was found to be temperature resistant till 55°c, beyond which the activity declined sharply. the time kinetics of alternation in activity profile was also monitored at selected temperatures. the t1/ <dig>  was calculated to be 62°c, which remains nearly comparable for  <dig>   <dig> and 60 min incubation. the enzyme activity showed a broad range of ph sustainability . the optimal activity of the enzyme was found to be in the ph range of 6– <dig> . about 70% of its optimal activity was retained in the acidic ph of  <dig>  and in the alkaline ph of  <dig> . while 90% of the maximal activity was lost at lower ph , the remaining activity at ph  <dig> , as compared to maximal was nearly 40%. although, it is suggested that the cuzn-sod is not ph dependent  <cit> , but recent results from recombinant proteins came with contradicting result  <cit> . the decrease of the enzyme activity at acidic ph might be due to the dissociation of dimer into monomer, as the acidic ph favors the monomer formation, whereas the alkaline ph favors the dimer formation  <cit> . charge interaction between the subunits has been also postulated to be a major determinant of cuzn-sod activity at varying phs  <cit> .the lowering of activity at acidic ph in this group of sods is also attributed to the release of cu ion from the active site  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
effect of incubation temperatures and phs on the pschsod activity. twenty units equivalent of protein was incubated at different temperatures  for different time interval  as shown in  and the remaining activity was assayed. the t1/ <dig> of the activity for 60 min has been marked with the solid line. effect of different ph on the activity of pschsod superoxide dismutase activity has been shown in .  <dig> units equivalent of protein were incubated in 50 mm of different buffer with respective ph at 37°c and the residual activity was assayed.



effect of denaturating and proteolytic agents on pschsod
pschsod exhibited very high tolerance to denaturating and proteolytic agents. the activity was not significantly affected by 4 m of urea and imidazole . the catalytic function of the enzyme remains unaltered by incubating the protein with trypsin and chymotrypsin for 3 hour .figure  <dig> 
effect of incubation of pschsod with denaturating and proteolytic agents. pschsod was incubated in the presence of  urea  imidazole at concentration 1–4 m as mentioned in the figure and with proteolytic enzyme  trypsin  and  chymotrypsin in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , at 37°c with varying time intervals of 0–3 h. residual activity was analyzed on 12% native-page with nbt staining as described in method section. the densitometric analysis of the in gel sod bands has been represented as additional file  <dig> 



proteolysis of proteins is often used as a selection tool to assess protein stability and to probe its energy states  <cit> . extensive characterization of different prokaryotic and eukaryotic cuzn-sods has established that monomeric and dimeric cuzn-sods have very different activity, thermal stability, metal affinity, and resistance to proteases  <cit> . various factors responsible for imparting high stability are relatively small solvent-exposed surface area, β-barrel fold, tight hydrophobic dimer interface and extensive ion-pair networks and better salt bridge formation  <cit> . results of proteolytic susceptibility of pschsod further suggested that the protein has limited access to partially and globally unfolded conformations under native conditions and the resistance might have been due to minimized occurrence of accessible conformations susceptible to proteolytic attack  <cit> .

longevity of pschsod stability and activity
purified pschsod was tested for its longevity through storage at room temperature  and 4°c and the protein samples kept at −20°c were considered as control . the enzyme did exhibit only 50% loss in activity even after 180 days of storage at room temperature. however, at 4°c the protein showed a transient elevation in activity, but undergoes a rapid inactivation in subsequent days. the final loss in activity is accounted for about 90% of activity as compared to activity of protein stored at −20°c. higher reduction of pschsod activity at 4°c suggests that the protein is not stable at this temperature and use of some cryo-protectants and/or suitable protease inhibitor may be able to maintain its original activity. the activity of the protein samples following 180 days of storage at different temperatures were also evaluated in-gel activity assay and the results have been shown as inset to figure  <dig> inset.figure  <dig> 
longevity of pschsod activity. purified pschsod was tested for its longevity both at room temperature and 4°c. percentage residual activity was judged periodically with pyrogallol assay and further analyzed with native-page and sod specific staining after 180 days. the protein sample kept at −20°c was also judge for native activity and taken as control because its remains unaltered even after 180 days. closed circle  represents the sample kept at room temperature while open circle  with solid line represents enzyme sample kept at 4°c.



pschsod sequence similarity and divergence
the percentage of identity and divergence in the amino acid sequence of selected sod was identified using clustal w program . the results of this analysis showed that pschsod was closely related to arabidopsis thaliana-sod sharing  <dig> % similarity, while  <dig> % similarity was evident for rice-sod, respectively. pschsod also shared about 58% similarity with s. cerevisiae and h. sapiens. the cu2+ site responsible for catalysis is also conserved as it is coordinated by four his residues  and the zn2+ site is bound to the protein through his- <dig>  his- <dig>  his- <dig>  and asp- <dig>  which is also conserved. to understand the evolutionary relationship between sod proteins from various phyla, an unrooted phylogram was constructed using clustal x with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. from the phylogenetic analysis, we found that plant sod from various family made clades according to their family. monocot and dicot fall in two different clades . bootstrap values of the nodes were found to be high in various families. a strong bootstrap value support for individual clades added confidence to the cladogram construction.figure  <dig> 
sequence analysis and homology modelling of pschsod  multiple sequence alignment was performed using clustalw software . accession no. of corresponding gene sequence are: pisum sativum: emb|caa <dig> |, arabidopsis thaliana: gb|aad <dig> |, saccharomyces cerevisiae: ref|np_ <dig> |, homo sapiens: pdb|1l3n|a and escherichia coli: ref|wp_ <dig> |). various conserved residue  for cu2+ and  for zn2+ has been marked with red and green arrow. common histidine  is also marked by black arrow while positively charged arg- <dig> is marked by purple arrow. chloroplast localization signal is present in sod from plants only.  tree was constructed using neighbor-joining method with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. monocot and dicot families are separated in two different clades.  homology modelling of pschsod was prepared by using default parameter at swiss model workspace . the figure shows the dimer of modelled pschsod with both cu2+ and zn2+ in active site. active site is exposed outside in both monomer. a helix and beta sheets are also labelled.  all the co-ordinates of cu2+  and zn2+  with his- <dig> being common in both cofactors show.



pschsod: motif to structural analysis
in order to detect the conserved domains and motifs among various sods, multiple sequence alignments were carried out. the n-terminal chloroplast localization signal was observed in all plant sod, whereas none of the yeast, human and e. coli proteins possessed this signal . plant sods were more similar to each other than to human and e. coli. the histidine residue in alignment is conserved in all sods across the phyla. on c-terminus, positively charged arg- <dig> located in the active site channel was also conserved without any exception among all the members included in the presented figure .

the search for structural homolog was carried out using pschsod as candidate. pschsod is a cuzn-sod; it was modelled against four different cuzn-sods which showed more than 90% sequence similarity . out of these models, two  were selected on the basis of presence of copper and zinc cofactor. in 3 km <dig> model, only zinc ions were present, so we also considered 3s0p model as it have copper ion in it. both the models were superimposed to get both copper and zinc incorporated. structure of pschsod revealed  <dig> β sheets and  <dig> α helices mostly exposed. all the co-ordinate for cu2+ and zn2+ were found to be conserved. histidine bound to copper and zinc are highlighted on multiple sequence alignment . the authenticity of the model was confirmed from various scores like e value . the color represented estimated per-residue inaccuracy visualized using a color gradient from blue  to red . overall, the sequence identity is more than 90% and the entire characteristic residue forming the active site is quite conserved throughout the species. however, in the absence of molecular structure, it is hard to explain the structural basis for the enhanced kinetic behavior of pschsod.

CONCLUSIONS
sods are critical enzymes that manage oxidative stress in almost all organisms dealing with the inevitable metabolic product of aerobic respiration i.e.o2∙−  <cit> . plants contain multiple sod isoenzymes, transcribe through distinct gene families. in plants, three forms of the enzyme exist, as classified by their active site metal ion: copper-zinc, manganese, and iron forms. the distribution of these enzymes has been studied both at the sub-cellular level and at the phylogenic level. it is only in plants that all three different types of sod are known to coexist  <cit> . their occurrence in the different sub-cellular compartments of plant cells allows us to study their molecular evolution and the possibility of understanding why three functionally equivalent but structurally different types of sod have been maintained? among all the isoforms of the enzyme, cuzn-sod is the most abundant in plants and thoroughly dispersed throughout evolution. phylogenetic analysis of plant sequences show that all chloroplast cuzn-sods are more related to each other than to cytosolic cuzn-sods, which also form their separate sub-group  <cit> . chloroplast contains both fe and cuzn-sod and, distribution of these isoforms vary among different species  <cit> . several functions have been postulated for sods in chloroplasts like protection to oxidative stress , photoprotection, regulation of electron transport and signaling. it is also remarkable to note that expression of fe-sod and cuzn-sod is found to be reciprocal in response to cu treatment, different stress treatments and development stages  <cit> . thus, chloroplastic isoform of the enzyme remains an excellent choice to study kinetic behavior of this class of enzyme to gain deeper insight into its structural feature, which can help the enzyme to modulate its activity to perform these diverse functions. the rationale of the present study is to describe an efficient method for the recombinant expression of pisum sativum chloroplastic cuzn-sod  in the enzymatically active  form. the protein was evaluated for its biochemical characteristics and found to possess the highest activity, reported so far. structural and signature motifs analysis through homology modeling further confirm that pschsod retains the conserved architecture of this class of protein. but it is the non-conserved sequence compared to other which could be responsible for this high activity of this protein. merely on the basis of homology modelling and multiple sequence alignment it is hard to elucidate the main character for the high activity of the protein. however, the higher kinetic properties in terms of its catalytic activity as observed in this study needs further understanding on the molecular aspects of substrata accessibly to the active site and its interaction kinetics. thus, the purified pschsod can be utilized for its structural study, has application in pharmaceutical industries and highly recommended for producing transgenic plants that need additional tolerance to oxidative stresses.
