BACKGROUND
over their long evolutionary history, plants have evolved morphological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic traits that enable them to respond to abiotic and biotic stresses 
 <cit> . reports on adaptive evolution in plants are numerous, but in general, specific phenotypes associated with putative adaptive events are not well understood 
 <cit> . one such event, the origin of the cuticle covering their outermost surfaces, was a key adaptation in the transition of plants from aqueous to terrestrial conditions. the cuticle plays an important role in protecting tissue from environmental stresses 
 <cit>  and is especially important for plants growing in drought-prone environments 
 <cit> . one of the most important roles of the cuticle is to provide a diffusion barrier against the uncontrolled loss or uptake of water and gases, although it has many other functions such as protection against uv irradiation, mechanical damage, and phytopathogens and herbivorous insects 
 <cit> . among the many genes involved in the process of cuticle formation, eibi <dig> is the only full abc transporter gene for releasing cuticle compounds reported in cereals. it was identified in wild barley, , as “hvabcg31” by analogy with the rice gene 
 <cit> . the hvabcg <dig> gene was cloned from a spontaneous mutant of wild barley from israel. this mutant had a drought-hypersensitive phenotype, with a 50% reduction in the major cutin monomers and an incomplete cuticle surface. hvabcg <dig> gene was mapped and sequenced and its major function was related to cuticle secretion 
 <cit> .

the distribution centre of hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum, the progenitor of cultivated barley, lies in the “fertile crescent”, starting from israel and jordan to southern turkey, iraq, kurdistan, and south-western iran 
 <cit> , and eastward into tibet 
 <cit> . israel is located at the junction of three continents and harbours remarkable ecosystemic diversity, such as sharp climatic divisions between northern mesic mediterranean and the southern xeric desert, topographical diversity from the dead sea  to the golan heights and mount hermon. environmental heterogeneity is a direct driving force for plant evolution in nature, and wide genetic variation is needed for populations to adapt and survive in highly variable and stressful environments. domestication and modern plant breeding practices have narrowed the genetic diversity in cultivated plants 
 <cit> . extraordinary genetic diversity of wild barley from israel has been recorded 
 <cit> . wild barley provides a rich source of potential variation for barley improvement because there are no biological barriers to crossing and meiotic recombination between wild and cultivated barley 
 <cit> . the basic characteristics of barley, such as a short life cycle, few chromosomes , predominant self-pollination, along with a high-density genetic map and high genetic synteny with other triticeae species, facilitate the exploitation of its potential value for crop improvement.

the coding regions of hvabcg <dig> are conserved in monocot and dicot plants 
 <cit> . increasing evidence indicates that the flanking gene regions are highly dynamic 
 <cit> . gene sequence variations reflect the genetic and evolutionary history of organisms 
 <cit> . transcription factor binding sites  located at promoter regions are important for regulating gene expression 
 <cit> .

in this study, the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and distribution of tfbss in the hvabcg <dig> promoter region were analyzed using  <dig> wild barley accessions from five natural populations from different habitats in israel, ranging from the southern xeric negev desert to the northern mesic golan heights. the phylogeny of the hvabcg <dig> promoter sequence suggested that adaptation to ecogeographic environmental stresses, including aridity, was an important explanatory factor for the observed variation and history of hvabcg <dig>  the analysis of tfbss in the hvabcg <dig> promoter region indicated that gibberellin , light, and abiotic stresses may be involved in the hvabcg <dig> transcriptional regulation.

RESULTS
genetic analysis of the hvabcg <dig> promoter sequence from five h. vulgare ssp. spontaneum populations in israel
sequences of the hvabcg <dig> promoter were compared among  <dig> wild barley accessions from five natural populations: mitzpe ramon , dead sea , "evolution canyon" , arbel , and yehudiyya  . the total length of the aligned hvabcg <dig> promoter sequences was  <dig> bp. we identified  <dig> haplotypes; all haplotype sequences were deposited in the ddbj database  with the accession numbers ab709909–ab <dig>  over 90% of the haplotypes were unique to a population:  <dig> haplotypes were population-specific, while only two were shared between populations in this study .

note: es refers to ‘european slope’ and as refers to ‘african slope’ of “evolution canyon”, lower nahal oren, mount carmel 
 <cit> ; the number in the bracket refers to the number of accessions in each population.

based on the major environmental factors of average rainfall and soil type , the five populations could be divided into the southern xeric group  and the northern mesic group . the northern mesic group included  <dig> haplotypes, most with low frequencies; whereas six haplotypes were found in the southern xeric group. four of five populations harboured a population-specific high-frequency haplotype; the exception, p <dig>  comprised several haplotypes in similar proportions . in population p <dig>  the majority of accessions  had one haplotype , and in population p <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> accessions shared one haplotype . interestingly, no haplotypes were shared between p <dig> and p <dig>  or between p <dig> and p <dig> . two haplotypes were shared between populations: hap  <dig> occurred in most accessions  of p <dig> and in some accessions in p <dig>  which has the same soil type ; hap  <dig> was shared in p <dig> and p <dig>  although the p <dig> accession was an isolated individual from the ‘european slope’ of “evolution canyon”.

the genetic variation within and between populations was calculated by amova. the genetic divergences were remarkably high . interestingly, more genetic variation occurred within populations than among populations ; the estimated fst was.

the genetic diversity analysis and the neutrality test results in different populations are summarized in table 
 <dig>  there were more haplotypes, and greater haplotype diversity  in two northern populations , but the highest hd and nucleotide diversity  were observed in p <dig> . two neutrality tests  showed that different populations experienced different selection pressures. no significant evidence for selection was identified in p <dig> and p <dig>  which together harboured  <dig> haplotypes. significant positive values were obtained for p <dig> using both the tajima and fu & li tests, suggesting balancing selection on the hvabcg <dig> promoter region in this population. in contrast, significant negative values for both tests were obtained for p <dig> and p <dig>  which could have been caused by purifying selection, demographic effects , or low frequencies of harmful mutations 
 <cit> . however, despite predominant haplotypes, low-frequency haplotypes were found in both p <dig> and p <dig> . one accession from p <dig> had hap  <dig>  and two accessions from p <dig> had hap  <dig> and hap  <dig>  

statistical significance in tajima's d test: * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> ; statistical significance in fu & li's f* test: **p <  <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis of h. vulgare ssp. spontaneum hvabcg <dig> promoter sequence
to investigate the relationships among the different populations, a phylogenetic tree based on snp haplotypes was constructed using maximum likelihood as implemented in mega <dig> software . the tree was rooted with the promoter sequence of a putative hvabcg <dig> homologue from the wheat  3b chromosome. most accessions  from the three northern mesic populations  formed one cluster . this cluster was further divided into two major sub-clusters with high support values: cluster 1-a from p <dig> and p <dig> and cluster 1-b from p <dig>  interestingly, the structure of the sub-clusters was in accordance with the soil types of their collection sites . the second cluster  included all  <dig> accessions from p <dig>  one accession from the xeric population of p <dig>  and one accession from the xeric ‘african slope’ of p <dig>  one shared haplotype  from both p <dig> and p <dig> proved very distant from both clusters and represented most of the accessions from p <dig>  and one accession from the ‘european slope’ of p <dig> 

the distances among the haplotypes in cluster  <dig>  were closer than those in cluster  <dig> . figure 
 <dig> depicts this pattern in more detail. the total number of polymorphic sites  was determined from the alignment of all  <dig> haplotypes . the number of differences between each of the haplotypes and the consensus sequence varied from 2– <dig>  there were  <dig> haplotypes in cluster  <dig> and six in cluster 2; one haplotype  was separated from all others. the majority of haplotypes  in cluster  <dig> differed by 2– <dig> bases from the consensus sequence, with the exceptions of hap  <dig>  and hap  <dig> . in cluster  <dig>  haplotypes differed from the consensus sequence by 16– <dig> bases, and the isolated hap  <dig> had  <dig> differences. a total of  <dig> rare polymorphisms were scattered among different haplotypes represented by one or two accessions. rare sites were found in about half of the haplotypes  from p <dig>  in one haplotype from each p <dig> and p <dig>  and in two haplotypes from p <dig>  most of the rare sites occurred in a few haplotypes, like hap  <dig> from p <dig>  and hap  <dig> from p <dig> . most of the rare polymorphic sites  appeared in three northern mesic populations . southern arid populations had fewer haplotypes, but they differed from the consensus sequence at a large number of positions, while northern mesic populations had more haplotypes that were, on average, closer to the consensus sequence.

transcription factor binding sites  in the hvabcg <dig> promoter
the total number of tfbss was  <dig> with a range of 121– <dig> among the haplotypes. there were 121– <dig>  and 121– <dig>  tfbss in the two southern arid populations, and 123– <dig> , 125– <dig> , and 123– <dig>  sites in the three northern mesic populations. the tfbss could be classified into  <dig> categories according to their basic functions . because the tfbss were rather short  and could have occurred randomly, their presence in the promoter sequences were statistically analyzed using a permutation test . a few tfbss related to ga, dof, and light were significant . many binding sequences related to various functions occurred at low frequency and were not significant. most were singletons or duplets, but some more common ones for ga  and light  also proved to be non-significant. one singleton with a long binding sequence  proved statistically significant .

of the  <dig> tfbss, about 70% were located in the conserved regions of the  <dig> haplotypes, whereas the rest appeared in the non-conserved regions . interestingly, the conserved regions included a high proportion of tfbss related to ga, dof, and light . in contrast, in the non-conserved regions, the ga tfbss signals were predominant  . for example: among the  <dig> tfbss in non-conserved regions,  <dig> were related to ga. figure 
 <dig> shows the distribution of non-conserved tfbss in all  <dig> haplotypes: of the  <dig> non-conserved tfbss,  <dig> were absent in the minority haplotypes , while  <dig> appeared in some minor haplotypes . a high proportion of non-conserved tfbss  affected minor haplotypes. most of these minor haplotypes  were related to haplotypes 1– <dig>   <dig> in  <dig> accessions; most of these accessions  originated from southern xeric populations ; the other two accessions came from the two slopes  of p <dig> 

discussion
genetic differentiation of hvabcg <dig> promoter sequences
high genetic diversity was found in the hvabcg <dig> promoter region   in the present study. similar results for the dehydrin  <dig> promoter region  were reported in a study of wild barley populations from israel 
 <cit> . numerous studies at global, regional, and local scales have demonstrated that genetic diversity is associated with stressful environments. in wild barley, this was shown using allozymes and dna markers  
 <cit> . drought is a major evolutionary driving force affecting plant genetic diversity and population genetic structure 
 <cit> . the sharp climatic division between the northern mesic mediterranean region and southern xeric negev desert in israel generates a gradient of increasing aridity. our phylogenetic analysis of hvabcg <dig> promoter sequences grouped most accessions  of the northern populations  into one cluster, whereas all accessions from the dead sea , one accession from mitzpe ramon , and one accession from the ‘african slope’ of “evolution canyon”  formed a second cluster. interestingly, there were many indel polymorphisms in our five natural populations but the basic phylogenetic structure was similar whether or not indels were considered . the major ecological factors differentiating the northern  and southern  populations, excluding geographic distance, were average annual rainfall and soil type. water availability is the most important environmental factor for plant growth 
 <cit> . drought stress is influenced by several factors including soil type, rainfall, temperature, and rate of evaporation. interestingly, the sub-clusters in cluster  <dig> were characterized by different soil types, terra rossa in cluster 1-a and basalt in cluster 1-b. therefore, drought stress may explain this separation 
 <cit> ; however, we cannot exclude the influence of other factors, such as isolation by distance.

in the current study significant evidence against neutrality  was found in the two southern populations  and in one northern populations , while no significant deviations from neutrality were found in the other two northern populations . significant positive values of the test statistics indicate balancing selection, while significant negative values may suggest purifying selection and demographic effects  
 <cit> . balancing selection detected in population p <dig> may relate to environmental heterogeneity. our mitzpe ramon  population is located in stressful habitats in the negev desert, and p <dig> is located in the dead sea area, with highly heterogeneous and stressful conditions including severe drought and salinity stresses. “evolution canyon”  consist of two opposite slopes: the warm-dry ‘african slope’ is drastically divergent from the cool and humid ‘european slope’, although they are separated by an average distance of only  <dig> meters. much research on “evolution canyon” has proved that the interslope divergent selection is due to microclimate 
 <cit>  .different selection pressures in different regions are important in adaptation to local habitats 
 <cit> . our results allowed us to assume that different selection pressures in our five populations affected adaptation to different environments. water availability may be an important selection pressure 
 <cit> . however, more extensive sampling is needed to support the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the hvabcg <dig> promoter are maintained by variable drought and salinity.

hvabcg <dig> expression may be regulated by transcription factors related to abiotic stress
although hvabcg <dig> is involved in cuticle formation 
 <cit> , only three tfbss related to flavonoid biosynthesis were found in its promoter region. tfbss copy numbers are considered to be important for transcriptional regulation 
 <cit> . the tfbss related to three factors  were significantly enriched in the hvabcg <dig> promoter. previous studies showed that cuticle formation is affected by drought and light 
 <cit> . the dof proteins are a family of plant-specific transcription factors involved in the control of multiple functions in plant growth and development including stress, light, and plant hormone responses 
 <cit> . ga is an important plant hormone that controls diverse aspects of growth and development 
 <cit> . in the non-conserved regions of the hvabcg <dig> promoter, most base changes  added or deleted ga-binding sites. of note, a recent microarray analysis of drought-stressed wild emmer wheat roots indicated that ga may be involved in drought resistance 
 <cit> . in addition, ga plays a crucial role in barley protection under drought and other stresses 
 <cit> . ga, light, and abiotic stresses may affect hvabcg <dig> transcription, which may indirectly indicate that hvabcg <dig> affects abiotic stress tolerance, although other processes may influence hvabcg <dig> 

base variation can dramatically change tfbss and thus affect gene regulation 
 <cit> . we found  <dig> non-conserved tfbss, some of which were lost or gained in the hvabcg <dig> promoters of minor haplotypes, mainly in the southern  populations. an early paper reported that tfbss can appear or disappear among closely related species and even within populations 
 <cit> . nevertheless, poor correlation exists between the divergence of tfbs sequences and gene expression, suggesting that gene expression might be regulated by compensatory mechanisms 
 <cit> . loss of binding sites may be buffered by the presence of other binding sites for additional factors that are involved in the same process or that bind cooperatively with the factor whose binding site has diverged 
 <cit> . it remains unknown whether such compensatory mechanisms have evolved in the control of barley hvabcg31; more expression experiments are required to further understand its regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
our phylogenetic analysis of eco-geographical variation in the 2kb promoter region of the hvabcg <dig> gene in five natural populations of h. vulgare ssp. spontaneum in israel suggests that aridity may be an important factor affecting the observed sequence variation. the analysis of tfbss in the hvabcg <dig> promoter region indicated that ga, light, and abiotic stresses may be involved in the hvabcg <dig> transcription regulation and that hvabcg <dig> may be involved in abiotic stress responses, both locally and regionally, thereby generating adaptive structures in response to environmental stresses.
