BACKGROUND
lawsonia intracellularis causes porcine proliferative enteropathy  in domestic pigs , and today, ppe is present in all swine-producing areas worldwide  <cit> . ppe has been described as a disease most that is common among grower and finisher pigs  <cit> . although pig-to-pig transmission is considered to be the primary route of infection  <cit> , little is known about the mechanisms of transmission of l. intracellularis and the epidemiology of ppe, especially in wildlife. although a few studies on l. intracellularis infection in wild boars have been conducted in european countries  <cit> , similar studies from asia are lacking. tomanova et al. reported that l. intracellularis was present in wild boars in the czech republic, using pcr analysis of intestinal tissues and/or serological examination in  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , whereas jacobson et al. found no evidence of fecal shedding in the swedish wild boar population  <cit> . while our manuscript was in preparation, the prevalence of antibodies to l. intracellularis in farmed european wild boars was also reported  <cit> . the aim of the present study was to assess the importance of the wild boar  population as a potential reservoir for l. intracellularis in the republic of korea . a nationwide prevalence survey was carried out to determine the l. intracellularis seroprevalence and we report the serological prevalence of l. intracellularis infection in captive wild boars from fields and forests in the rok.

RESULTS
in this study,  <dig> serum samples collected from clinically healthy wild boars in fields and forests were examined by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay . antibodies to l. intracellularis were observed in  <dig> wild boars. the overall apparent prevalence calculated directly from the sample and the true prevalence calculated based on the accuracy of the test method were  <dig> % :  <dig> - <dig> %) and  <dig> % , respectively. table  <dig> presents the prevalence of antibodies to l. intracellularis in the wild boar population from  <dig> provinces in the rok. serologically positive animals were found in all the tested provinces. gyeonggi province, which produces more domestic pigs than any other province in the rok  <cit> , and gangwon province showed high  prevalence, at  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively.

previous studies have shown the presence of l. intracellularis among wild boar in europe  <cit> . the results of the current study show that l. intracellularis infections also occur in wild boar populations in asia. the previously reported prevalence of l. intracellularis determined by pcr analysis of intestinal tissues and/or serological examination of wild boars were as follows:  <dig> %  in farmed european wild boars  <cit> ,  <dig> % in wild boars in germany  <cit> , and  <dig> % in wild boars in the czech republic  <cit> . the seroprevalence of this study in the wild boar population in the rok was lower than that  in the domestic pig population in rok  <cit> .

in previous reports, tomanova et al. assumed that wild boars are infected orally, although wild boars may not be exposed to l. intracellularis infections from feces to the same extent as domestic pigs kept under intensive farming conditions  <cit> . regarding the recent publication stating that rodents may be an important reservoir of l. intracellularis <cit> , l. intracellularis could be transmitted from domestic pigs to wild animals through infected rodents, and then the infection could be maintained within individual social groups of animals, e.g., within domestic pigs or within domestic pigs, through fecal contamination. however, the possibility that wild boars infected with l. intracellularis could be a significant transmission source of this disease to domestic pigs cannot be ruled out. in addition, the infections may persist because wild pigs infected with l. intracellularis do not get treated with antibiotics.

the author acknowledges the limitation that seroprevalence only indicates exposure to the agent and it does not indicate ongoing infection nor does it indicate shedding of the bacteria in amounts sufficient to infect other animals. therefore, the high seroprevalence in wild boars warrants further studies to evaluate their potential as a reservoir species.

wild boars  are distributed throughout asia, europe, and northwest africa, and at least  <dig> subspecies are currently recognized  <cit> . the korean wild boar  is a common inhabitant of fields and forests on the korean peninsula  <cit> . the results of the current study confirm that l. intracellularis is present in the wild boar population worldwide, even in far east asia.

CONCLUSIONS
our results confirm that l. intracellularis is present in the wild boar population worldwide, even in far east asia. despite the high seroprevalence shown in wild boars, further studies are warranted to evaluate their potential as a reservoir species because seroprevalence does not prove ongoing infection nor shedding of the bacteria in amounts sufficient to infect other animals. it should also be determined whether the wild boar, like the domestic pig, is a natural host of l. intracellularis.
