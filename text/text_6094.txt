BACKGROUND
il- <dig> and il- <dig> are two structurally close hematopoietic cytokines, both presenting a functional redundancy and both involved in immunology and inflammatory diseases. il- <dig> was implicated in the first metastatic melanoma immunotherapy  <cit>  and is used in adoptive immunotherapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes . most treatments require high doses of il- <dig>  <cit>  and induce a systemic toxicity similar to gm-csf  treatments  <cit> . these secondary effects restrict the therapy and have led to investigations into other forms of treatment, such as the promising il- <dig> therapy.

transduction receptor chains il-2rβ and il-2rγc  form an intermediate-affinity complex capable of binding il- <dig> and il- <dig>  whereas the il-2rβ chain is restricted to dimeric receptor for il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit>  or to specific trimeric receptors , the il-2rγc chain is involved in γc-family receptors, that is to say the il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and gm-csf receptors <cit> . γc-deficit is implicated in immunodeficiency, such as x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency  <cit> .

fluorescence resonance energy transfer  studies suggest that il-2rα, il-7rα and il-15rα chains are co-localized <cit>  with il-2rβ and γc chains within lipid rafts <cit> . il-2rα and il-15rα chains also appear to co-localize in lipid rafts with mhc  chains, with icam- <dig> in antigen-presenting cells , and with lymphoma and cd4+ t-cells <cit> . the majority of these chains are involved in the immune synapse   <cit>  and this supports the implication of il-2/il- <dig> receptors in this is complex, contributing to their very fast response to stimuli.

due to the therapeutic interest of il- <dig> and il- <dig> and their activating properties on the il-2rβ/il-2rγ receptor, we aimed to study the two chains forming this receptor. however, the structure of these chains remains unknown due to the crystallization problems of transmembrane domains .

since no structural models of il-2rβ and γc tmds are available, we needed to model them. we first tried to predict the tmds using sequences as input via 2d tmd-determination methods  but this led to fluctuations in predicting interfacial residues, according to the species or the method . in the same way, long sequences in 3d structure predicting methods led here to highly flexible tmd models  of between  <dig> and  <dig> Å), especially for il-2rβ. to resolve this problem, we developed a procedure to define the tmd center by scanning the sequence in different species. this procedure uses the in-silico peplook method <cit>  combined with the impala method for predicting the membrane restraint effect on the structure.

we validated our approach with sequences of proteins with known tmd structures  and succeeded in correctly predicting the tmd limits. we then applied this approach to the il-2rβ and il-2rγ sequences. structures of both tmds were helical, and residues responsible for flexibility or interaction were determined.

RESULTS
as we were looking for structural and functional data on il-2rβ and il-2rγc tmds, we first analyzed the available sequences among different species.

multi-species alignment of sequences and transmembrane segment prediction
according to inter-species alignment of il-2rβ sequences , identity is low and only two glycines  around the tmd center are strictly conserved, separated by  <dig> or  <dig> a.a., corresponding to either a gxxg  pattern  or a gxxxg  pattern . we can observe that the gg <dig> motif corresponds to a flip of g{cs} in the gg <dig> pattern, observed in cows, rats and mice, to {cst}g. the horse sequence shows a glycine insertion just before the gg <dig> pattern. sequence alignments show conservation of some charged and polar residues at the extremities of the potential tmd.

the shared il-2rγc chain is much more conserved than il-2rβ for mammals with an identity higher than 70%. a pattern can be identified: f258axeavxixxgxmglixxlxxvyxwler285-box <dig> with a potential gg <dig> pattern and where box <dig> represents the cytosolic motif involved in interaction with the second messenger jak-kinase. although this chain is shared by  <dig> different receptors and its sequence would therefore be expected to be conserved, we were very surprised to observe a proline to serine substitution just before the v267gsmgli <dig> conserved region, in pigs, cows, rats, mice and dogs, which could induce a kink.

since we wanted to model the chains for modeling and interaction studies, the first step was to accurately delimit the tmd: we tested tmd predictions for il-2rβ and il-2rγc sequences in different species using the split <dig>  tmhmm <dig>  thumbu, sosui, hmmtop and memsat <dig> methods <cit> . 2d-structure prediction methods confirmed that the tmds of il-2rβ and il-2rγc are helical, polytopic and mono-spanning. however, tmd predictions differed with a maximal shift of  <dig> residues, depending on the species and on the prediction method .

in a first approach, we modeled the whole predicted tmd, composed of  <dig> a.a. for il-2rβ  and  <dig> a.a. for il-2rγc , using peplook  <cit> 
, in a hydrophobic environment or with impala membrane restraints. peplook allows the prediction of the 3d structure and flexibility using the sequence only as input. il-2rβ showed no consensus because of the high structural flexibility of the i258-n <dig> segment models . il-2rβ was assumed to be contained inside the membrane but it cannot be inserted into the membrane using the impala method <cit> . il-2rγc presents a much reduced flexibility. we noticed that polymorphism seemed to be sequence-length dependent  for sequences presenting high flexibility such as il-2rβ.

calibration of the in-silico tmd-determination method
we carried out a local prediction by scanning the peptide sequence in a hydrophobic environment with a sliding window, so as to delimit more precisely the tmd limits and flexible domains . in order to determine the window length avoiding polymorphism induced by sequence length, we used the tmd sequences from proteins presenting nmr structures with a low rmsd  of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, with different lengths: we used gpa , epha <dig>  and erb <dig> . we then decided to choose the window length inducing a flexibility of less than the double rmsd observed in nmr models: for this, we determined the window length where the  <dig> best energetic structures, resulting from the peplook method, were clustered with a rmsd lower than  <dig> Å. we found that the window length was lower than or equal to  <dig> a.a.

in order to calibrate the strategy, we applied it to gpa, epha <dig> and erb <dig>  whose nmr structures and tmd central residues are known as a result of using the impala method <cit>  and/or opm database models <cit> . we analyzed different parameters for all the peptides generated by the sliding window procedure: the mean of the helical structure with a window of  <dig> residues, the hydrophobic to hydrophilic accessible surface ratio , the average mean force potential  percentage and the depth of membrane insertion with impala. this means that for each residue, we analyzed  <dig> scans, generating  <dig> structures encompassing the residue of interest. of all these parameters tested with sequences from known nmr-structures, we found that the best criterion for defining the tmd center was the asar mean with the highest value  for the central residue compared to a value of around  <dig> for interfacial amino acids. this was confirmed by the mean of the helical structure, which must be up to 75%. the impala method also confirmed these central residues, except for erb <dig>  for which we observed a shift of  <dig> residues .

structural prediction of the il-2rβ tmd
following these results, we submitted the il-2rβ sequence from  <dig> different species  to this procedure. the four species have a similar helical structure, asar and membrane penetration : asar and the impala scan allowed us to predict that the tmd is centered on f <dig> and g <dig>  which is consistent with the percentage of helical structure at these positions . however, in homo sapiens, two close maxima were observed for insertion and asar . the w <dig> residue of il-2rβ seemed to be localized at the extracellular membrane interface and y <dig> on the intracellular side, which is consistent with known data regarding tmds <cit> . the scan-peptides presenting the highest rmsd were centered on residues from l <dig> to l <dig> .

structural prediction of the il-2rγc tmd
the same procedure was applied to il-2rγ sequences: the predicted tmd is centered on g <dig> and l <dig> for humans and on homologous residues for other species. despite an identical result for asar in all species, human structures presented a shift of two residues in the impala scan . this chain structure is less flexible than for il-2rβ but peptides centered on residues from f <dig> to l <dig> presented a rmsd higher than  <dig> Å.

mfp analysis
the mfp percentage <cit>  allows us to predict whether a residue is in a stable structural environment  or not . the structures obtained with our scan method were used to calculate mfp values. concerning il-2rβ, the flexible i258-n <dig> segment presented an mfp percentage of lower than 40%: such values mean that residues are not stabilized and would therefore need to interact. i <dig> and y <dig> and i <dig> interfacial residues presented mfp percentages of lower than 30% and, in the center of the tmd, f <dig> and f <dig> also had low mfp percentages . for il-2rγ, cytoplasmic residues of tmd extremities presented low mfp values as for il-2rβ  but for fewer residues: l272-i <dig> and c278-w <dig>  the interfacial residue n <dig> presented an extremely low mfp percentage with only 14%.

discussion
efficiency of the local scan with the peplook procedure
the absence of 3d structures for il-2rβ and il-2rγ led us to model them in-silico. calculation time for such modeling simulations increases with the number of residues and with the use of supplementary restraints.

we first modeled the whole potential tmd, but this led to a long calculation time and structural flexibility at both membrane interfaces with artifactual loops going back into the membrane; moreover, we found that polymorphism increased with sequence length. results of sequence-based tmd 2d-predictions did not allow us to delimit tmds accurately or to reduce the target sequence. in addition, we found no improvement with these 2d-predictions for our target proteins as compared to the use of more basic methods, which include analyzing the hydrophobicity scale or the most frequently present residues at the membrane interface  or the charged residues usually present at the juxta-membrane interface , as reviewed by white <cit>  and popot <cit> .

in this paper, we developed an in silico method  consisting of a local scan with a  <dig> a.a. window using the peplook method, in order to delimit the tmd more accurately. this scan also allows us to predict other structural properties such as structural polymorphism and potential interaction residues.

we calibrated our method by delimiting precisely intra-membrane regions of mono-spanning receptors using proteins whose nmr structures are known and whose central residues are determined: gpa, epha <dig> and erb <dig>  we analyzed different parameters for all the peptides generated: the helical structure, the asar, the average mfp percentage and the depth of membrane insertion with impala. the best criterion for defining the tmd center was found to be asar, which presented the highest value for the central residues. the percentage of helical structure and membrane insertion with the impala method provided complementary data to support this result. however, the impala parameter of scanned-peptides showed different results in the case of erb <dig> 

in order to understand this phenomenon, we split the reference structure of gpa into small peptides from  <dig> to  <dig> residues and submitted them to the impala membrane insertion method: the orientation and the penetration of the peptide into the membrane were very variable for small peptides, even for a shift of only one residue . we also noticed that charged residues were not always sufficient to explain this. so we attribute the different results in determining the central residue of erb <dig> to the importance of the residues at the end of the peptides for membrane insertion.

moreover, the above procedure could be very useful for determining minimal protein sequences that could be used in experimental structure determination methods in a hydrophobic environment. our results show that adding or removing only one residue at the end of the peptide can totally change its orientation and/or penetration into a lipid environment. however, it does not seem possible to establish a simple rule on this. so if peptides cannot penetrate into a lipid environment, stabilization induced by lipid interaction cannot occur during experimental structure determination methods.

evolution of sequences and structures of the il-2rγc and il-2rβ chain receptors
as we obtained good results for known tmd structures, we used the same method to determine the tmds of the different sequences of il-2rβ and il-2rγc for homo sapiens, bos taurus, mus musculus and rattus norvegicus.

the il-2rγc chain sequence was much more conserved than for il-2rβ: this can be explained by the fact that il-2rγc is shared by the il- <dig> receptor  and by the il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptors. the conserved region of il-2rγc  contains a gg <dig> pattern, which is important for dimerization and may be involved in the recruitment of other receptor chains. unexpectedly, mice, rat, dog, cow and pig sequences presented a proline just before this conserved region. this proline is involved in a kink on the extracellular side of the tmd helix, contrary to the case of anthropoids and the duck-billed platypus.

tmd predictions should be equivalent, since the sequence alignments present conservation of some charged, polar and interfacial residues near the putative tmd. the four species showed similar results  and this similarity allowed us to use inter-species means of each different parameter to avoid isolated ambiguous values: the residue presenting the highest asar or best impala insertion values for homo sapiens was characterized by a double maximum . the first result was not correct according to the charged residues, which were then inside the membrane. using results across species showed a better correlation . moreover, asa values were more precise here than values from 2d methods  and we found impala to be a good complementary parameter where two close maxima were observed, as in the hil-2rβ case.

finally, we found that the tmds of il-2rβ and il-2rγ were respectively centered between f255-g <dig> and g271-l <dig>  the delimitation of the tmd depends on the tilt angle, which was lower than 30°, so tmds with interfaces are to be limited to w243-c <dig> for il-2rβ and f258-l <dig> for il-2rγ.

another advantage of this method is the possibility of calculating mfp percentage levels  <cit> : our results showed that these were lower than 40% for the i258-n <dig> segment from il-2rβ, in contrast to the remainder of the sequence; so this domain needs interactions with another molecule to stabilize its structure. according to this mfp analysis, i <dig> y <dig> and i <dig> residues from il-2rβ could therefore interact in particular with lipids or proteins which could stabilize the structure of the chain receptors. similar results were found for il-2rγ: residues in l272-i <dig> and in c278-w <dig> presented mfp percentages of between  <dig> and 30% and may interact with the cytoplasmic part of il-2rβ and/or lipids. the interfacial residue n <dig> presented a very low mfp percentage  and may be important for interaction.

the extremities of the il-2rβ and il-2rγ tmds present a very high level of conservation and may be involved in a stable orientation in every species. these residues are implicated in interactions with lipids or in the recruitment of several chains known to be co-localized with il-2rγc: il-2rβ, il-2rα, il-15rα and il-7rα <cit> . in addition, constantinescu <cit>  has described an essential hydrophobic motif for epo-r activity, at the juxta-membrane side, with conserved hydrophobic residues in many cytokine receptors located in front of functional domains . homologs of this interfacial motif are found in both cytoplasmic sides of tmds, presenting a low mfp, and may modulate protein orientation: lxxxfw for il-2rγ and lxxxli for il-2rβ.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our scan-based method is more accurate than 2d methods for the delimitation of tmds, especially for polymorphic domains or across different species. we validated our approach with structures whose nmr-structures are known and applied it to il-2rβ and il-2rγc. these scans also allowed us to obtain more information about the structure and polymorphism of tmds, about mfp and potential interactions, and about residues that are important in membrane insertion. a webserver for this peplook-based method was developed during this study and a peplook webserver will be accessible in a few months at http://www.fsagx.ac.be/bp.

the method described in this paper is currently being developed to model longer target sequences of  <dig> residues. preliminary results correlate our predictions of tmd limits with the impala method and suggest that polymorphism is also better identified for those sequences in a rational calculation time. moreover, this method will describe how already folded stable domains can be involved in the folding of flexible domains, such as the domain of il-2rβ.
