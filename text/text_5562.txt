BACKGROUND
mycoplasma hyopneumoniae causes porcine enzootic pneumonia, which is a mild, chronic pneumonia of swine  <cit> . this highly infectious organism has a worldwide distribution. the primary mycoplasmal infection often becomes complicated by secondary bacterial and viral infections  <cit> , resulting in more severe lung lesions and production losses. relative control has been achieved through active vaccination programs, but porcine enzootic pneumonia continues to be a major economic problem in the swine industry. while progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of some mycoplasma diseases  <cit> , advances in m. hyopneumoniae research have been hampered by its fastidious growth condition and the lack of genetic tools and transformation protocols. to date, few virulence determinants or virulence-associated determinants have been identified. attachment to the respiratory epithelium is a prerequisite for host colonization and is mediated by the membrane protein p <dig>  <cit> . this protein is located on the outer membrane surface, and its role in adherence has been firmly established. the general region of p <dig> that mediates adherence to swine cilia is thought to be the r <dig> region, near the c-terminus of the protein  <cit> . to bind cilia, a minimum of eight tandem copies of the pentapeptide sequence  in r <dig> are required  <cit> . although the function of r <dig> in vivo is unknown, both it and r <dig> are required to bind heparin  <cit> . the p <dig> genes of m. hyopneumoniae strains  <dig>   <dig>  and j code for proteins with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the previously described r <dig> repeating units , respectively; all three strains had more than the minimum number of tandem copies  required for cilium binding  <cit> . moreover, monoclonal antibodies f1b <dig> and f2g <dig>  which both react predominantly with p <dig>  <cit> , only partially block adherence of m. hyopneumoniae to receptors on epithelial cell cilia  <cit> . these observations indicate that molecules other than p <dig> play a role in facilitating adherence of m. hyopneumoniae to swine cilia. comparative transcriptomic and proteomic studies are also performed to study transcriptional changes that occur during disease and investigate differentially expressed proteins in pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains  <cit> . several m. hyopneumoniae proteins, including immunodominant proteins , adhesin-related proteins , and a 54-kda cytotoxic factor  <cit> , have been characterized; however, the biological functions of these proteins in pathogenesis are not well understood.

comparative genomic analysis has previously revealed mechanisms of m. hyopneumoniae pathogenicity  <cit>  and predicted unidentified virulence factors, including genes involved in secretion and/or traffic between host and pathogen cells, or with evasion and/or modulation of the host immune system  <cit> . in  <dig>  vasconcelos et al. sequenced a pathogenic and a non-pathogenic strain of m. hyopneumoniae and performed a comparative genomics approach to identify putative virulence genes  <cit> . they identified various cdss that could be considered candidate virulence genes, including cilium adhesin homologs, lipoproteins, and other components which might contribute to virulence  <cit> . however, comparative genomic analysis of a virulent m. hyopneumoniae strain versus its attenuated strain is lacking.

the need to control the spread of m. hyopneumoniae prompted the development of live attenuated vaccine strains. m. hyopneumoniae strain 168-l has been extensively used as vaccine against m. hyopneumoniae in china  <cit> . this attenuated vaccine strain is derived from the virulent parent strain  <dig>  strain  <dig> was originally isolated in  <dig>  from an er-hua-nian pig  with typical clinical and pathogenic characteristics of mycoplasmal pneumonia of swine   <cit> . this field strain was gradually attenuated by more than  <dig> continuous passages through km <dig> cell-free medium  and the 380th passage was named strain 168-l. currently, the genetic basis for the attenuation of virulence in 168-l is poorly understood.

to gain new insight into the components that contribute to virulence and the mechanisms by which m. hyopneumoniae causes disease, we sequenced the genomes of strains  <dig> and 168-l. this allowed us to perform the first comprehensive analysis of virulent and attenuated strains, and identify cdss that may be related to virulence. we further investigated these putative virulence related cdss and compared them with reported virulence determinants. notably, almost all reported virulence determinants were found in putative virulence related cdss. besides the reported virulence determinants, other candidate virulence genes were also identified. the study of these candidate virulence genes and their corresponding products will be important to better comprehend the pathogenesis of m. hyopneumoniae.

RESULTS
genomic features of m. hyopneumoniae 168-l and its global comparison with pathogenic strain 168
the complete genome of m. hyopneumoniae 168-l consists of a  <dig>  bp  single circular chromosome . a total of  <dig> protein-encoding genes were predicted. the average protein size is  <dig> amino acids and the mean coding percentage is  <dig> %. approximately 51% of genes were assigned to specific functional clusters of orthologous groups , and 28% were assigned an enzyme classification  number . comparison with the m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> genome  revealed a highly conserved gene content and order between the two strains. the 168-l genome is  <dig>  bp smaller than that of  <dig> , because there are  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions  in 168-l relative to  <dig> . among these,  <dig> indels are located in predicted cdss, and  <dig> are in noncoding regions. besides these indels,  <dig> single nucleotide variations  were identified between  <dig> and 168-l . while  <dig> snvs were mapped to intergenic regions,  <dig> were in coding regions, inducing amino acid substitutions, frame shifts, and translational stops.


ismhp1-related genetic variations between  <dig> and 168-l
the difference between the genome sizes of strains  <dig> and 168-l is mainly due to differences in the duplication of insertion sequence  elements. is elements are distributed stochastically across the entire genome of both strains. the 168-l genome contains nine complete and one disrupted is elements, which is almost identical to that of  <dig> except for slight differences in ismhp <dig>  there are nine complete copies of ismhp <dig> in 168-l, but  <dig> copies in  <dig>  the difference in ismhp <dig> copy number between  <dig> and 168-l is due to three complete ismhp <dig> deletions  and one complete ismhp <dig> inversion, which was originally located at  <dig> kb from oric, but was inverted in 168-l  .


other than the is elements, notable large-scale genomic differences were also indicated. compared to strain  <dig>  a genomic deletion of approximately  <dig>  kb  was identified, which had been substituted with an approximately  <dig>  kb novel insertion sequence  that was joined to a complete ismhp <dig> element in 168-l . this 168-l-related insertion fragment was also observed in strains  <dig> and  <dig> 

molecular analysis of integrative conjugative element 
the integrative conjugative element  is a mobile dna that is probably involved in genomic recombination events and in pathogenicity. the iceh elements are more divergent than the typical similarity of other chromosomal locus in m. hyopneunomiae <cit> , suggesting an accelerated evolution of these constins  <cit> . during a survey of specific sequences, a specific  <dig> -kb region with similarity to the integrative conjugal element of m. fermentans   <cit>  was found in strain  <dig>  which was designated iceh . unlike iceh in strains  <dig> and  <dig>  which consist of nineteen and twenty two cdss, respectively, the iceh <dig> consist of  <dig> cdss . the organization of these elements is very similar. some cdss present similarity to tra genes, which are usually associated with the bacteria conjugative plasmids such as trak, trai, trae <cit> . the iceh <dig> has three tra genes, with one trag and two copies of the trae gene. besides, a cds encoding for a single strand binding protein  that is essential for the transfer process is also observed.

the ice analysis of three m. hyopneumoniae genomes  carried out previously, revealed that the iceh is present in the two pathogenic strains  but is absent from the non-pathogenic one   <cit> . interest has therefore shifted to questions of whether the iceh is present in the attenuated vaccine strain 168-l. interestingly, the iceh was also observed in strain 168-l. moreover, the iceh <dig> and iceh168-l are almost the same, except for a missense mutation  identified in iceh-orf <dig> . our analyses indicate that the iceh may not only present in pathogenic strains of m. hyopneumoniae.

mutations affecting epithelium adhesion
in our previous study, the ability of adherence and damage to the cilia between strains  <dig> and 168-l were compared by using scanning electron microscopy. the results showed that the pathogenic strain  <dig> adheres to cilia inducing tangling, clumping, and longitudinal splitting of cilia, while the strain 168-l does not cause ciliary damage comparing to control group  <cit> . the adherence of m. hyopneumoniae to porcine ciliated respiratory cells is essential for the organism to colonize the respiratory epithelium and cause pneumonia  <cit> . the adherence process is mainly mediated by receptor-ligand interactions, and the m. hyopneumoniae proteins possibly involved in these interactions are obvious candidates as virulence factors  <cit> . we investigated the genetic variation between strains  <dig> and 168-l , and compared mutations affecting cdss corresponding to previously described mycoplasma adhesins   <cit> . notably, almost all the reported mycoplasma adhesins are included in the cdss affected by mutations .


in 168-l, three transversions were identified in the r <dig> region, near the c-terminus, of p <dig> , which encodes cilium adhesin. in m. hyopneumoniae, attachment to the respiratory epithelium is mainly mediated by the membrane protein p <dig>  <cit> . this protein is located on the outer membrane surface, and its role in adherence has been firmly established. to bind cilia, a minimum of eight tandem copies of the pentapeptide sequence  in r <dig> are required  <cit> . notably, all three transversion mutations were located in the tandem repeat unit , causing an e863v substitution. significant alteration in this critical repeat unit might partly affect the adhesion reaction in 168-l.

previous studies have demonstrated that p <dig> binds fibronectin and contributes to the recruitment of plasmin to the m. hyopneumoniae cell surface  <cit> . p <dig> is commonly linked to p <dig> cilium adhesin, forming a two-gene operon  <cit> . both p <dig> and p <dig> have several paralogs within the m. hyopneumoniae genome. however, the paralogs have only part of the complete sequence. interestingly, p <dig>  the companion gene in this operon, was truncated at  <dig> bp by a single base insertion in strain  <dig>  another intact copy of p <dig>  was found  <dig> kb from this operon. conversely, in strain 168-l, the original truncated p <dig> was reverted to the intact one, while another intact copy of p <dig>   <dig> kb away, was truncated.

the p <dig> adhesin-like protein of m. hyopneumoniae shows strong similarity to the lpps lipoprotein of mycoplasma conjunctivae, which is involved in in vitro adhesion  <cit> . in addition, the n-terminus region of p <dig> also shows strong similarity to the p <dig> adhesin, and has a strongly hydrophobic region , indicating a transmembrane region, and suggesting that the protein is expressed on the surface of m. hyopneumoniae cells  <cit> . compared with its counterpart mhp168_ <dig> in  <dig>  mhp168l_ <dig> from 168-l has an in-frame insertion of one amino acid  at the n-terminus of p <dig>  the enormous intra-specific diversity shown for the p <dig> encoding gene is at least partly because of differences between several repeat regions present in the gene, most notably a polyserine chain of variable length, and a nm repeat region  <cit> . interestingly, this one in-frame insertion  was located in the nm repeat region. polyserine chains often function as a spacer region in proteins involved in complex carbohydrate degradation  <cit> , while sequences rich in both proline and glutamine are not uncommon and can form a conformation known as a polyproline ii helix  <cit> . such proline-rich sequences are often involved in binding processes and are highly immunogenic  <cit> . however, because the function of the p <dig> protein remains unknown, correlations with virulence or adhesion are speculative and need further investigation.

p <dig> is a proteolytically processed surface adhesin of m. hyopneumoniae <cit> . three proteins with apparent molecular masses of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kda were identified through proteomic analysis of m. hyopneumoniae lysates  <cit> , with each representing a different region spanning p <dig>  these cleavage fragments are located on the cell surface and present at all growth stages. in 168-l, mhp168l_ <dig>  has a missense mutation resulting in a g240a replacement in the gs repeat region of p <dig>  although this gs repeat region has been reported, its biological function is unknown.

p <dig>  is a proteolytically processed cilium and heparin binding protein of m. hyopneumoniae <cit> . this surface protein is post-translationally processed to generate n-terminal p <dig> and c-terminal p <dig> fragments, both of which can bind cilia  <cit> . the 168-l p <dig> gene has an in-frame four amino acid deletion in a poly q motif near the c-terminus. previous studies have suggested that poly q and keke motifs may play a role in maintaining p <dig> on the cell surface  <cit> . collectively, the deletion mutations affecting p <dig> may affect its cilium adhesion and may be associated with virulence attenuation in 168-l.

the mhp168l_ <dig> gene and its gene product lppt were analyzed in detail because they showed approximately 22% identity to the lppt protein from m. conjunctivae. lppt is the second gene in a two gene operon with lpps, which was reported to be an adhesin in m. conjunctivae <cit> . the lppt gene lacked a promoter and is likely to be co-transcribed with lpps, thus suggesting a functional relationship between lpps and lppt  <cit> . in m. hyopneumoniae, lppt encoded a protein of  <dig> aa with a calculated molecular mass  <dig> kda. the gene product encoded by lppt is also a membrane protein, with a signal sequence of  <dig> aa at the amino-terminal end and a transmembrane structure. notably, one of the amino acid substitutions in 168-l occurs near the c-terminus of lppt, resulting in a l814f replacement.

mutations altering the cell envelope and genes encoding secreted proteins
cell envelope proteins and secreted proteins are involved in virulence, host cell interaction, and immune responses  <cit> . outer membrane protein-p <dig> is a cell envelope protein in m. hyopneumoniae. in 168-l, mhp168l_ <dig>  is truncated by a nonsense mutation compared to  <dig>  resulting in an e965* termination near the c-terminus of p <dig>  significant alteration in this outer membrane protein could conceivably cause a truncation in coding region, and in turn alter the function of p <dig> outer membrane protein.

m. hyopneumoniae contains an abbreviated membrane protein secretory system  <cit> . the pathway consists of seca , secy , secd , prsa , dnak , trigger factor , and lepa . it has recently been demonstrated that some pathogenic bacteria use a type iv secretion system, composed of subunits related to the conjugation machinery, to deliver effector molecules to host cells  <cit> , and that this system may be involved in pathogenesis  <cit> . we found no pathogenic mutations in the protein secretory system, except a synonymous substitution  in mhp168l_ <dig>  which encodes chaperone protein dnak.

mutations affecting antigens
studies on the antigenic properties of m. hyopneumoniae revealed several immunodominant proteins, including the p <dig> cytosolic protein  <cit> , the p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> membranous proteins  <cit> , the elongation factor tu  <cit> , the chaperone protein dnak <cit> , the pyruvate dehydrogenase e1-beta subunit  <cit> , and the p <dig> adhesin  <cit> . the functions of these proteins have not been well elucidated, but specific reactants may eventually be useful tools to diagnose m. hyopneumoniae <cit> .

the cytosolic p <dig> protein is a lactate dehydrogenase  <cit>  that induced an early immune response in pigs that are experimentally and naturally infected by m. hyopneumoniae <cit> . comparative studies with other mycoplasmas commonly found in pigs demonstrated that the p <dig> proteins carry highly conserved species-specific antigenic determinants for m. hyopneumoniae <cit> . hyperimmune sera produced against recombinant p <dig> protein showed no reactivity against other porcine mycoplasmas, including m. flocculare, m. hyorhinis, and acholeplasma laidlawii <cit> . notably, one of the observed amino acid substitutions in 168-l occurs near the c-terminus of p <dig> , resulting in a n204d replacement.

p <dig> is an immunodominant surface lipoprotein of m. hyopneumoniae that is specifically recognized during disease  <cit> . analysis of the translated amino acid sequence of the gene encoding p <dig> revealed similarity to the gdsl family of lipolytic enzymes  <cit> . the monospecific antibodies against heat shock protein-like p <dig> antigen, part of p <dig>  can block the growth of m. hyopneumoniae <cit> . in 168-l, mhp168l_ <dig>  has a missense mutation resulting in a t138a replacement.

mutations affecting transport proteins
as mycoplasmas are dependent on the exogenous supply of many nutrients, it has been predicted that they may need many transport systems  <cit> . motif analysis revealed a family of proteins with a phosphotransferase  motif. the open reading frames  included sgaa , sgab , sgat , mtlf , mtla , nage , and lica   <cit> . however, no mutations were identified in this pts transporter family. there are approximately  <dig> genes with abc transporter family signatures in the genome of m. hyopneumoniae 168-l , and five missense mutations and one synonymous substitution were identified in this group. these included a cobalt import atp-binding protein , an abc transporter permease protein , a xylose abc transporter atp-binding protein , and three abc transporter atp-binding proteins . interestingly, the expression of mhp168l_ <dig> and mhp168l_ <dig> was reported to be up-regulated in vivo during disease relative to in vitro-grown  <cit> . the variability between strains  <dig> and 168-l in multi-transport proteins indicates that they may affect growth and survival in different hosts or host tissues.

mutations affecting genes directly related to metabolism and in vivo growth
m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> encodes  <dig> genes, approximately one quarter of which are involved in metabolism and in vivo growth. of particular interest were the mutations observed in the genes involved in various metabolic pathways , including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , purine metabolism , pyrimidine metabolism , glycerophospholipid metabolism , oxidative phosphorylation , aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis , and the pentose phosphate pathway . an in-frame insertion of two amino acids , a missense mutation  and a nonsense mutation  were identified in 168-l near the c-terminus of mhp168l_ <dig>  which encodes a nadh oxidase involved in oxidative phosphorylation. mycoplasma genomes are deficient in genes coding for components of intermediary and energy metabolism  <cit> . thus, mycoplasmas depend mostly on glycolysis to synthesize atp  <cit> . in the glycolysis pathway, missense mutations in both l-lactate and pyruvate dehydrogenase were observed, resulting in n204d and s194g replacements, respectively. iron deprivation, is a prominent feature of the host innate immune response, and most certainly impacts growth of mycoplasmas in vivo <cit> . through transcriptome analysis, mhp168_ <dig> was identified to be down-regulated during iron limiting conditions  <cit> . this suggests that mhp168_ <dig> may play a role in m. hyopneumoniae’s response to iron stress. in 168-l, mhp168l_ <dig> has a missense mutation resulting in an e411k replacement. mutations in these metabolism-related genes accumulated over  <dig> in vitro passages likely affect growth and survival within host cells.


in addition, approximately 41% of mutations affected genes coding for hypothetical proteins. despite the lack of functional annotations for these genes, their disruption in 168-l makes them obvious targets for investigation as potential virulence factors. further molecular genetics and in vivo studies are required to confirm and assess the relative importance of these genes in the attenuation of virulence in 168-l.

CONCLUSIONS
we successfully used a combination of sequencing genomics and comparative genomics strategies to provide a comprehensive analysis of virulent and attenuated m. hyopneumoniae strains to identify determinants involved in pathogenesis. the genome of the attenuated high-passage derivative strain 168-l was sequenced and compared to virulent strain  <dig>  revealing mutations in numerous cdss. these mutations affected cdss are likely to be associated with virulence. we then compared these putative virulence factor cdss to reported virulence determinants. notably, almost all of the reported m. hyopneumoniae virulence determinants were included in the list of putative virulence factor cdss. variations in the previously described mycoplasma adhesins , cell envelope proteins , cell surface antigens , secreted proteins, chaperone protein , and genes directly related to metabolism and in vivo growth may contribute to loss of virulence in 168-l. we then proceeded to characterize the alterations in gene functions caused by mutations at the protein level, and compared those mutations with previously described repeat motifs that may be of primary importance for virulence  <cit> . interestingly, we found that many mutations were located in the virulence associated motifs of the various proteins. to bind cilia, a minimum of eight tandem copies of the pentapeptide sequence  in the r <dig> region of p <dig> are required  <cit> . we identified three mutations in the tandem repeat unit , causing an e863v substitution. a similar situation was also observed in several other virulence associated genes . we hypothesize that the cumulative effect of mutations in virulence associated genes may account for the attenuation of virulence in 168-l. in this study, a total of  <dig> genetic variations were identified. while these included reported virulence-related genes, other novel virulence determinants were also identified. however, further molecular genetics and in vivo studies are required to confirm and assess the relative importance of these suspected novel virulence determinants in the attenuation of virulence. the comparative genomic analysis presented here will not only provide insights into the basis of attenuation of virulence in 168-l, but may also provide targets for mutagenesis in the pursuit of development of a more efficacious vaccine.
