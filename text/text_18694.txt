BACKGROUND
ca2+ is an essential second messenger in all eukaryotic cells in triggering physiological changes in response to external stimuli. due to the activities of ca2+-atpases and ca2+-channels on the cellular membrane, rapid and transient changes of its cytosolic concentrations are possible. in plant cells, a wide range of stimuli trigger cytosolic  increases of different magnitude and specialized character  <cit> , which are typically transmitted by protein sensors that preferably bind ca2+. ca2+ binding results in conformation changes that modulate their activity or their ability to interact with other proteins. for the majority of ca2+-binding proteins, the ca2+-binding sites are composed of a characteristic helix-loop-helix motif called an ef hand. each loop, including the end of the second flanking helix, provides seven ligands for binding ca2+ with a pentagonal bipyramid geometry. ca2+-binding ligands are within the region designated as +x*+y*+z*-y*-x**-z, in which * represents an intervening residue. three ligands for ca2+ coordination are provided by carboxylate oxygens from residues  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , one from a carbonyl oxygen from residue  <dig> , and two from carboxylate oxygens in residue  <dig> , which is a highly conserved glutamate . the seventh ligand is provided either by a carboxylate side chain from residue  <dig>  or from a water molecule.

in plants, three major groups of ca2+-binding proteins that have been characterized include calmodulin , ca2+-dependent protein kinase , and calcineurin b-like protein   <cit> . recently, reddy asn and colleagues have analyzed the complete arabidopsis genome sequence, identified  <dig> genes encoding ef-hand-containing proteins and grouped them into  <dig> classes  <cit> . cam, a unique ca2+ sensor that does not possess functional domains other than the ca2+-binding motifs belongs to group iv along with numerous cam-related proteins. cam is a small  multifunctional protein that transduces the signal of increased ca2+ concentration by binding to and altering the activities of a variety of target proteins. the activities of these proteins affect physiological responses to the vast array of specific stimuli received by plant cells  <cit> . in plants, one striking characteristic is that numerous isoforms of cam may occur within a single plant species. a large family of genes encoding cam and closely related proteins from several plants has been identified, however, with the exception of arabidopsis, families of genes encoding cam and related proteins have not been extensively conducted in a whole-genome scale. in addition, a very limited number of studies on individual rice cams has been published  <cit> .

with the completion of the genomic dna sequencing project in oryza sativa l., all sequences belong to a multigene family such as cam and related proteins can be identified. preliminary searching of oryza sativa l. databases revealed numerous genes encoding cam-like proteins. in arabidopsis, mccormack and braam  <cit>  have characterized members of groups iv and v from the  <dig> ef-hand encoding genes identified in the arabidopsis genome. six loci are defined as cam genes and  <dig> additional genes are cam-like  genes, encoding proteins composed mostly of ef-hand ca2+-binding motifs. the high complexity of the cam and related calcium sensors proteins in arabidopsis suggests their important and diverse roles of ca2+ signaling. it would be interesting to know how this family of proteins exists in the genome of rice which is considered a model plant for monocot and cereal plants because of its small genome size and chromosomal co-linearity with other major cereal crops. in this study, we identified genes encoding proteins that contain ef-hand motifs and are related to cam from the rice genome. analyses of the identified gene and protein sequences including gene structures, chromosomal locations, the ef-hand motif organization and expression characteristics as well as comparison with arabidopsis cam and cml genes were carried out.

RESULTS
identification and phylogenetic analysis of ef-hand-containing proteins
to identify ef-hand-containing proteins, firstly, we functionally searched the oryza sativa l. genome at the institute for genomic research   <cit>  for interpro database matches by five different methods including hmmpfam, hmmsmart, blastprodom, profilescan and superfamily as described in the "methods" section. secondly, we searched the rice database using the amino acid sequences of rice cam <dig>  <cit>  and cbl <dig>  <cit>  as queries in the programs blastp and the protein sequences that were not found by the domain searches were added to the list. in addition, we reviewed literature on reports of ef-hand-containing proteins in rice that have been identified by various methods. all of these protein sequences were again analyzed for ef hands and other domains using interproscan  <cit> . interproscan is a protein domain identifying tool that combines different protein signature recognition methods from the consortium member databases of the interpro  <cit> . as a result, domain searches identified  <dig> proteins but six sequences did not have an ef hand identifiable by interproscan using default settings, so they were eliminated from further analysis. blast searches have found four more ef-hand-containing proteins and literature review has yielded no additional proteins. totally, a maximum of  <dig> putative ef-hand-containing proteins in rice have been identified . nearly half of these proteins contain no other identifiable domains predicted by interproscan. it should be noted that  <dig> proteins contain a single ef-hand motif that was identified by only one prediction program and could be false positives.

next, sequences of all the proteins identified by the interproscan as containing an ef-hand motif were aligned using clustal x  <cit>  . tree construction using the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap analysis was performed. figure  <dig> shows the tree outline illustrating the numbers of ef hands predicted by interproscan for each protein on the right without any gene identifiers. as a result, proteins that do not possess functional domains other the ca2+-binding ef-hand motifs were found distributed across the tree but most were concentrated in the top half. conversely, most proteins in the bottom half contain additional domains that give clues to their functions which include transcription factor, ion channel, dna- or atp/gtp-binding protein, mitochondrial carrier protein, protein phosphatase and protein kinase. two known major groups of ef-hand-containing proteins: calcineurin b-like   <cit>  and ca2+-dependent protein kinase  proteins  <cit>  are separately grouped as shown in figure  <dig>  we observed that most of the proteins containing four ef-hand motifs are either in the cpk group or located at the top of the tree surrounding the typical cam proteins. with the exception of two, all proteins indicated by "cam & cml" share at least 25% amino acid identity with oscam <dig> and were selected for further analyses. this list should contain rice proteins that are related to cam or has functions based on ca2+-binding mode similar to cam. existence of these genes and their deduced amino acid sequences were confirmed using another annotation database, the rice annotation project database   <cit> .

rice cam proteins
the full-length amino acid sequences of the selected proteins were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. tree construction using the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap analysis performed with clustalx  generated a consensus tree which is depicted in figure  <dig>  this analysis led us to separate these proteins into six groups: 1– <dig>  what defines a "true" cam and distinguishes it from a cam-like protein that serves a distinct role in vivo is still an open question. different experimental approaches including biochemical and genetic analyses have been taken to address this question  <cit> . in this study by phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequence similarity, five proteins in group  <dig> that have the highest degrees of amino acid sequence identity  to known typical cams from other plant species were identified. because of these high degrees of amino acid identity, we classified them as "true" cams that probably function as typical cams. they were named oscam1- <dig>  oscam1- <dig>  oscam1- <dig>  oscam <dig> and oscam <dig>  their characteristics are summarized in table  <dig> 

oscam1-1; oscam1- <dig> and oscam1- <dig> encode identical proteins, whereas oscam <dig> and oscam <dig> encode a protein of only two amino acid differences and their sequences share  <dig> % identity with those of oscam <dig> proteins. multiple sequence alignment of the oscam amino acid sequences with those of typical cams from other species shown in figure  <dig> indicates their high degree of sequence conservation. it should be mentioned that oscam <dig> amino acid sequences are identical to those of typical cams from barley  and wheat  reflecting the close relationships among monocot cereal plants. on average, oscam amino acid sequences share about 99%, 90% and 60% identity with those from plants, vertebrates and yeast, respectively. hydrophobic residues contributing to hydrophobic interaction in the mechanism of cam-target protein complex formation which are critical to cam function are highly conserved. all of the conserved eight methionine  and nine phenylalanine  residues among plant cams are present in all oscams. conservation of these residues is maintained between plant and vertebrate cams, with the exception of the methionine residues at position 145– <dig> in plants cams, which are displaced one residue compared with the vertebrate proteins. due to its considerable conformational flexibility  <cit>  and being weakly polarized, methionine residues which are estimated to contribute nearly half of the accessible surface area of the hydrophobic patches of cam allow it to interact with target proteins in a sequence-independent manner  <cit> . sequence conservation related to functionality of plant cams also includes lysine  at position  <dig> which is assumed to be trimethylated. all oscam proteins possess a lysine residue at this position. lysine  <dig> trimethylation is believed to be a posttranslational modification that helps regulate cam activity. ef-hand motifs will be discussed later in the "number and structure of ef hand" subsection.

the presence of multiple cam isoforms is a defining characteristic of cams in plants. even though the explanation of gene redundancy still cannot be ruled out, accumulating evidence suggests that each of the cam genes may have distinct and significant functions. previous reports have shown that highly conserved cam isoforms actually modulate target proteins differently  <cit> . induced expression of some but not all of the multiple cam isoforms in a plant tissue in response to certain stimuli has been reported  <cit>  thus, competition among cam isoforms for target proteins may be found. it is fascinating that the oscam1- <dig>  oscam1- <dig>  and oscam1- <dig> genes encode identical proteins. how these protein sequences have been maintained with the natural selection pressure throughout evolution has no clear answer yet but it is likely that each of these genes has physiological significance.

rice cam-like  proteins
the remaining proteins from the phylogenetic analysis in figure  <dig> were named cam-like or cml according to the classification by mccormack and braam  <cit> . like cam, these proteins are composed entirely of ef hands with no other identifiable functional domains. a summary of their characteristics is shown in table  <dig>  they were named according to their percentages of amino acid identity with oscam <dig> which were calculated by dividing the number of identical residues by the total number of residues that had been aligned to emphasize the identical amino acids. these proteins are small proteins consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues and sharing amino acid identity between  <dig> % to  <dig> % with oscam <dig>  all the cml proteins in group  <dig> share more than 60% of amino acid sequence identity with oscam <dig>  the cml proteins in groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have identities with oscam <dig> that average  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. by the bootstrapped phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequence similarity of these proteins, group  <dig> cml proteins were separated into five subgroups: 6a-6e. these proteins share identities no more than  <dig> % with oscam <dig> that average at  <dig> % with the exception of oscml <dig> . all members of groups 6b and 6e contain three ef-hand motifs though with different configurations.

some important cam functional features were found existing only in a few cam-like proteins. the characteristic cysteine  at residue  <dig> of the first ef hand, a hallmark of higher plant cam sequences is absent in all cam-like proteins with the exception of three highly conserved cml proteins, which are oscml <dig>  oscml <dig> and oscml <dig>  based on multiple sequence alignment, oscml <dig>  oscml <dig>  oscml <dig> oscml <dig>  oscml <dig>  oscml <dig>  and oscml <dig> are the only cam-like proteins that contain lysine at a position equivalent to the lys <dig> of cams. these features may be indicators of proteins that serve similar in vivo functions with those of cams. oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> are the only cam-like proteins that possess both of these signature characteristics. however, another important determinant of cam function, which is a high percentage of methionine  residues, has been found in most of the oscml proteins. the average percentage of m residues among oscmls is  <dig> % compared with  <dig> % in oscams. considering the usually low percentage found in other proteins, the met-rich feature in cmls is likely an indication of their relatedness to cams and possibly similar mechanisms of action i.e. exposure of hydrophobic residues caused by conformational changes upon ca2+ binding. nonetheless, some newly attained characteristics specific to cmls probably allow them to fine-tune their ca2+-regulated activity to more specialized functions.

of these proteins, three oscmls contain an extended c-terminal basic domain and a caax  motif, a putative prenylation site . oscml <dig>  also known as oscam <dig> was identified as a novel cam-like protein by xiao and colleagues  <cit> . the cml protein was reported to be membrane-associated when it is prenylated and localized in the nucleus when it is unprenylated  <cit> . a similar protein called cam <dig> previously found in the petunia also contains an extended c-terminal basic domain and a caax motif which are required for efficient prenylation  <cit> . similar subcellular localization of cam <dig> depending on its prenylation state was reported. to locate another possible modification, all proteins were analyzed by the computer program, myristoylator  <cit> . as a result, oscml <dig> was predicted to contain a potential myristoylation sequence. no other potential myristoylated glycines either terminal or internal were found among the rest of the oscml proteins. in addition, to determine the possible localization of the oscml proteins, their sequences were analyzed by targetp  <cit> . oscml <dig> was predicted to contain an endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence and oscml <dig> was predicted to be an organellar protein. for oscams and other oscmls, no targeting sequence was present, thus, they are probably cytosolic or nuclear proteins

number and structure of ef hand
the number of ef hands in the rice ef-hand-containing proteins varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  a summary of the number of proteins having  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> ef hands is shown in figure 4a. it turned out that among the  <dig> proteins identified, almost all proteins that contain  <dig> ef hands were included in our study or are cpk proteins. all five oscam proteins have two pairs of ef hands with characteristic residues commonly found in plant cams. consensus sequence of the ca2+-binding site in the ef hands of plant cams compared with oscam <dig>  oscam <dig>  oscam <dig>  vertebrate cam, and cmd1p from yeast is shown in figure 4b. ca2+-coordinating residues among oscams are invariable with those of the plant cam consensus sequence. other residues in the ca2+-binding loop are also conserved with only the exception of aspartate  at residue  <dig> of the fourth ef hand in oscam <dig>  among the twenty ef-hand motifs of oscams, residues  <dig> and  <dig> are exclusively filled with aspartate ; residues  <dig> are aspartate  and asparagine ; and residues  <dig> are glutamate  which is invariably found in this position of most ca2+-binding ef hand motifs. this residue may rotate to give bidentate or monodentate metal ion chelation. glutamate provides two coordination sites, favoring ca2+ over mg2+ coordination  <cit> . residues  <dig> are usually varied; and residues  <dig> are aspartate , asparagine , threonine , and serine  which are all normally found among plant cams.

schematic diagrams of each protein sequence with the predicted ef hands represented by closed boxes are shown in figure  <dig>  among all the identified oscam and oscml proteins, about three fourths of the ef hands that exist in pairs  are interrupted by  <dig> amino acids. the rest are positioned at a similar distance relative to each other which is between 25– <dig> amino acids with the exception of two pairs that are less than  <dig> amino acids apart. most oscml proteins have either two pairs or at least one pair of identifiable ef hands except oscml <dig> which has a single ef hand and oscml <dig> which appears to have two separate ef hands. oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> are interesting because of their high amino acid identities with oscam <dig>  but they possess only  <dig> and  <dig> ef hands; and have relatively low methionine  content  compared with other oscml proteins, respectively. in addition,  <dig> oscml proteins with one pair of identifiable ef hands have an extra ef hand that does not pair with any other motif. pairing of ef-hand motifs in the cam molecule helps increase its affinity for ca2+, therefore an unpaired ef hand in these proteins may bind ca2+ with a lower affinity, or may be non-functional.

ligands for ca2+ coordination in the ef-hand motifs of oscml proteins are highly conserved. one hundred and thirteen ca2+-binding sequences were aligned and the frequency at which amino acids were found is tabulated in figure 4c. most residues in the ca2+-binding loops are conserved among oscml proteins, thus suggesting that most of them are functional ef hands. similar to oscams, residues  <dig> are exclusively filled with aspartate ; and residues  <dig> and  <dig> are usually aspartate  or asparagine . even though they are not coordinating residues, glycine  at position  <dig> is absolutely conserved and hydrophobic residues  are always found at position  <dig> in all  <dig> ef hands in oscam and oscml proteins. residues  <dig> are mostly glutamate  with the exceptions of an ef hand in oscml <dig>  oscml <dig>  and oscml <dig> which have aspartate  instead. while oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> have two pairs of ef-hand motifs, oscml <dig> possess two separate ef hands with d at residue  <dig> in the ef-hand motif at the carboxyl terminus. cates and colleagues  <cit> , previously reported that mutation of e <dig> to d reduced the affinity of ef hands for ca2+ in parvalbumin by 100-fold and raised the affinity for mg2+ by 10-fold. it is likely that these ef hands bind mg2+rather than ca2+ but the physiological significance of mg2+-binding cam-like activity is still not known.

cam and cml gene structures and chromosomal distribution
the structures of the oscam and oscml genes were mapped by comparing their full length cdnas with the corresponding genomic dna sequences. in cases where no full length cdna was available, partial cdna and est sequences were used. their results were compared and verified with the annotation at the tigr database. out of  <dig> oscam and oscml genes,  <dig> genes contain intron in their coding regions in which none of these is found in group  <dig> and  <dig> members. it should be mentioned that by tigr annotation oscam1- <dig> and oscml <dig> genes were shown to have an alternatively spliced mrna that encodes a slightly different protein with little supporting evidence so they were eliminated from our list. schematic diagrams depicting intron-exon structures of the intron-containing genes are shown in figure  <dig>  all oscam genes contain a single intron which interrupts their coding regions within the codon encoding gly <dig>  a typical rearrangement of all plant cam genes.

interestingly, all of the intron-containing oscml genes are also interrupted by an intron at the same location as oscam genes. the conservation of this intron position indicates their close relationships which is consistent with the fact that these genes encode members of the cml proteins groups 1- <dig>  closely-related cam-like proteins to oscams. oscml <dig>  oscml <dig>  and oscml <dig> genes contain an additional intron that resides at the codon corresponding to the last residue of genes encoding conventional cams. these proteins have an extended c-terminal basic domain and a putative prenylation site. the position of these introns reflects the separation of functional domains within these proteins and suggests that the sequences encoding their carboxyl extensions arose later in the evolution by the fusion of existing cam genes to the additional exons. similarly, oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> which encode group  <dig> proteins have the same gene structure which is the same intron number  and location. the gene duplication event that led to the existence of oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> is also supported by the high degree of amino acid identity  between oscml <dig> and oscml <dig>  in these proteins, one of the six introns locates within the sequence encoding the third ef-hand motif, a location comparable to gly <dig> of the first ef-hand motif. this intron is probably the remnant of a duplication event that originally gave rise to two ef-hand pairs in these proteins. interestingly, oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> are two out of only three oscmls that contain aspartate  at residues  <dig>  these observations suggest that the mutation of e <dig> to d in oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> probably occurred before the duplication event that led to their existence.

the chromosomal location of each gene was determined from the annotation at the tigr database. oscam and oscml genes were found distributed across  <dig> chromosomes of rice as shown in figure  <dig> with chromosome  <dig> having the most numbers  of genes. oscam1- <dig> was mapped in chromosome  <dig>  oscam1- <dig> in chromosome 7; oscam1- <dig>  and oscam <dig> in chromosome 1; and oscam <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  their nucleotide sequences share between 86– <dig> % identities which are lower than their amino acid identities . multiple oscam genes encoding nearly identical proteins have been maintained through natural selection suggesting the functional significance of each gene. oscam1- <dig> and oscam1- <dig> which encode identical proteins were mapped to the duplicated regions of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. oscam1- <dig> and oscam <dig> were also located within duplicated genome segments of their respective chromosomes. these observations suggest that these pairs of genes are derived from segmental duplication. in addition, there are many pairs/groups of oscml genes which encode proteins that share a high degree of amino acid identity . oscml2/oscml <dig>  and oscml25/oscml <dig>  are the most closely related pairs. oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> encode potential ca2+-binding proteins in group  <dig> with an absolute conservation of the c-terminal sequences that contain a prenylation site . oscml <dig> and oscml25; and oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> were mapped to the recently duplicated regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. therefore, oscml2/oscml3; and oscml25/oscml <dig> may have arisen through the segmental duplication event. other pairs/groups of closely related cam-like genes that are likely to be derived from gene duplication events are oscml1/oscam1-1; oscml10/oscml15;oscml24/oscml27; and oscml19/oscml23/oscml <dig>  all members in each pair or group have the same number and positions of ef-hand motifs. the positions of predicted segmental duplication according to the analyses by tigr are illustrated along with the chromosomal locations of the affected genes in figure  <dig>  conversely, oscml <dig>  oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> are arranged in tandem orientation on chromosome  <dig> suggesting that they were derived from tandem duplication. interestingly, oscml <dig> is adjacent to oscam1- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and its duplicated gene, oscml <dig>  resides in tandem with oscam1- <dig> . therefore, a local duplication followed by a segmental duplication possibly occurred.

comparative analysis of rice and arabidopsis cam and cml genes
the full-length amino acid sequences of rice cams and cmls and arabidopsis cams and cmls were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. tree construction using the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap analysis was performed with clustalx . in arabidopsis by the neighbor joining tree based on amino acid similarities, mccormack and braam  <cit>  divided cams and cmls into  <dig> groups. we found that several rice cams and cmls shared high levels of similarity with arabidopsis cams and cmls and displayed relationships among the family members similar to those previously reported in arabidopsis as shown in figure  <dig>  all of oscam proteins in arabidopsis and rice are highly conserved . interestingly, both arabidopsis and rice have three oscam genes that encode identical proteins . rice cmls groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins were closely related to arabidopsis cmls group  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the more divergent rice cmls groups 6a to 6e are also distributed among members of arabidopsis cml groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. apparently, groups  <dig> from both species are embedded in groups  <dig>  these resulted from the arbitrary separation of groups  <dig>  even though group  <dig> members share very high degrees of identity  with group  <dig> proteins. because what defines a "true" cam and distinguishes it from a cam-like protein that serves a distinct role in vivo is still unknown, therefore at the moment, only members that share extremely high degrees of identity  were grouped together to emphasize that they were considered and are possible "true" cams.

based on amino acid sequence alignments , many of oscmls have putative homologues in arabidopsis. in group  <dig>  oscml <dig> which shares a high level of identity with atcml <dig> and atcml <dig> has the same number  and locations of introns except that atcml <dig> lacks the first intron. similarly, atcml <dig> and atcml <dig> which share a high level of identity with their homologues  have a similar gene structure which is the conservation of five out of the six introns present in their rice counterparts. interestingly, atcml19/ <dig> and oscml8/ <dig> proteins have aspartate  at residues  <dig> in one of their ef hands, though not on the same hand. atcml <dig> and atcml <dig>  which were thought to have a common progenitor, have very high level of identity  with group  <dig> oscml <dig> and all have the mutation of e <dig> to d in an ef hand corresponding to the third ef hand position. however, oscml <dig> has lost an ef hand corresponding to the second position while a second e <dig> to d mutation was found in atcml <dig> and atcml <dig>  therefore, similar to atcml <dig> and atcml <dig>  oscml <dig> has only one ef hand with canonical amino acids which may result in an impaired ability to bind ca2+. in oscml group  <dig>  oscml <dig> is closely similar to atcml <dig> and atcml <dig> and, interestingly all have a relatively low percentage of methionine  compared with other cml proteins that share similar levels of identity with cams. oscml <dig> has only  <dig> % methionine content which suggests that its mode of action upon ca2+ binding is probably different from the hydrophobic surface exposure upon conformational changes of cam.

previous reports identified  <dig> ef-hand-containing proteins from the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . seven loci were defined as cam genes and  <dig> additional genes were cml genes  <cit> . here, we identified  <dig> ef-hand-containing proteins, five cam genes and  <dig> cml genes. fewer members of rice cmls were identified and several arabidopsis cmls did not fall into any group of the rice proteins probably because rice oscml proteins we included in these analyses had at least 25% identity with typical cams compared to 16% in arabidopsis by mccormack & braam . we noticed that all of the arabidopsis proteins that did not fall into any group of the rice proteins shared only 16– <dig> % identity with typical cams. therefore, both plants appear to have more or less similar numbers of ef-hand-containing and cam-like proteins. both also have similar numbers of cpk  and cbl genes   <cit> . however, one strikingly different characteristic that we observed is the three oscml proteins  that have the carboxyl-terminal caax motif for prenylation but none was found in cmls from arabidopsis  <cit> . it would be interesting to know what functions these rice proteins possess and how the prenylation state affects their activity.

cam and cml expression
because the presence of cdna or est clones indicates expression of the corresponding genes, we performed searches against the cdna/est rice databases. the searches revealed that majority of the oscam and oscml genes have corresponding cdna or est clones. we have identified all the est clones for each of the oscam and oscml genes. characteristics of their expression can be inferred according to which libraries the est clones were derived from. a summary of the numbers of est clones found in different organs is presented in table  <dig>  based on the availability of their est clones, most oscam and oscml genes are expressed. some oscml genes are highly expressed in specific organs compared with other genes such as oscml <dig> and oscml <dig> in floral tissues. no cdna or est clone is available for oscml <dig>  oscml <dig>  oscml <dig>  and oscml <dig>  however, it is not conclusive that these genes do not express relying solely on the absence of their est clones. nonetheless, the availability of est clones for the rest of the oscam and oscml genes indicate that they are expressed and indeed are functional genes.

because five oscam genes encode only three different proteins, whether or not they have different physiological functions is an interesting question. here, we experimentally determined whether the expression of each of the oscam genes is restricted to specific organs. total rna was isolated from the leaves, roots, flowers, immature seeds and calli of rice plants and used to perform reverse transcription and pcr amplification reactions. primers selected by computer analysis of the cdna and est sequences corresponding to these genes are given in table  <dig>  a control rt-pcr reaction without adding reverse transcriptase was done in parallel with each experimental reaction to ensure that the product obtained could be attributed to the product of the reverse transcriptase reaction. figure  <dig> shows that bands of the expected sizes based on each of the gene sequences  were detected in all organs or tissues examined including the leaves and roots of 2-week old seedlings, mature leaves, flowers, immature seeds and calli. no band was detected in the control rt-pcr reactions. it should be noted that the rt-pcr conditions used in this study did not allow quantitative determination, therefore comparison of the expression levels among different organs or different genes can not be made. nevertheless, it can be concluded that all of oscam genes were expressed in all organs that we examined.

the expression of closely related cam genes in a single organ was not surprising. several similar occurrences in other plant species have been reported. in tobacco, all  <dig> cam closely related genes were expressed in almost all organs examined with a few exceptions, notably ntcam <dig>  which was exclusively expressed in the root  <cit> . however, ntcam <dig> encodes a protein of less than 80% identity to typical plant cams. similarly, acam1-acam <dig> genes which encode nearly identical proteins were all expressed in the leaves and siliques of arabidopsis  <cit> . while cam expression is ubiquitous among different cells, protein concentrations may vary in specific cell types. immunolocalization studies have shown that root cap cells and meristematic zones have increased cam accumulation  <cit> . in addition, levels of steady state transcripts of cam genes have been reported to be modulated at different developmental stages  <cit>  and in response to external stimuli such as salinity, wind, cold, wounding and pathogen attack  <cit> . oscam1- <dig> was shown to be rapidly and strongly increased in leaves under osmotic stress  <cit> . modulation of expression in specific organs of a cam isoform possibly serves its roles in a timely fashion.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> proteins that possibly have ef-hand motifs and  <dig> cams and related potential calcium sensor proteins in the rice genome. the functions of most proteins encoded by these genes are still unknown. nonetheless, the complexity of cam protein family likely reflects the importance of ca2+ signals in regulating cellular responses to various cellular stimuli and this family of proteins potentially plays a critical role. the present results can lead to further studies on each member of this family which will be invaluable in understanding the mechanisms of ca2+-regulated signal transduction pathways in rice.
