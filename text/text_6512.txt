BACKGROUND
in most mammals, gonad differentiation depends on the presence or absence of the sry gene, the sex-determining region of y chromosome  <cit> . sry encodes an hmg domain protein that is sufficient to switch on the testis-differentiating pathway  <cit> . following sry expression, specifically in the future supporting cells of the xy bipotential gonad, sox <dig> remains up-regulated and sertoli cell differentiation occurs  <cit> . the crucial role of sox <dig> in testis differentiation has been demonstrated by gain and loss of function mutations in mice  <cit> . acting with the transcription factor sox <dig> is the diffusible growth factor fgf <dig> shown to be involved in sox <dig> expressional maintenance, xy-specific cell migration from the mesonephros into the gonad and germ cell survival in the fetal testis  <cit> .

in the xx female counterpart, the repression of the testis-differentiating pathway seems to be part of the molecular events leading to ovarian differentiation. indeed, in human and domestic animals, xx male phenotypes can result from homozygous mutations in anti-testis genes specifically expressed in ovaries  <cit> . in mouse, the secreted protein wnt <dig> antagonizes the testis specific genes sox9/fgf <dig>  behaving as an anti-testis molecule  <cit> . although some male features appear in xx wnt4-/- mice, such as a testis-specific coelomic vessel and testosterone production, xx sex-reversal is not completely achieved  <cit> . up to now, two loci have been proved to be associated with complete xx sex-reversal, pis in goat  <cit>  and more recently, rspo <dig> in human  <cit> .

in goat, the pis  mutation gives rise to an absence of horns in heterozygous and homozygous animals of both sexes  and to a female-to-male sex-reversal in xx homozygous animals   <cit> . testis differentiation in xx pis-/- animals occurs very precociously during fetal life , with a ~ <dig> days delay compared to xy males and affects primarily the supporting cells of the gonads  <cit> . in normal xy gonads, sox <dig> and amh up-regulation occur between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc. during this period, foxl <dig> and cyp <dig> transcriptions begin to be detectable in normal xx gonads  <cit> . from a genetic point of view, this goat syndrome is due to an autosomal deletion of  <dig>  kb localized on goat chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this deletion encompasses elements enhancing the ovarian transcription of at least three genes: foxl <dig> encoding a transcription factor, pfoxic and pisrt <dig>  two non-coding rnas  <cit> . all these genes are expressed from the first stage of ovarian differentiation to adulthood in normal xx pis+/+ and pis+/- gonads. their expression is lost in xx pis-/- sex-reversed gonads  <cit> . interestingly, xx foxl2-/- mice show an early disruption of folliculogenesis that recapitulates a phenotype of premature ovarian failure  also encountered in xx bpes type i patients  carrying a heterozygous mutation of the foxl <dig> gene  <cit> . the phenotype discrepancy of the ovarian foxl2/foxl <dig> loss of function mutations between goat and mouse can be either due to the complexity of the goat pis mutation that affects other genes than foxl <dig> or to species-specific differences in the ovarian differentiating pathway.

more recently in human, homozygous mutations of the r-spondin <dig> gene  have been shown to be responsible for xx sex-reversal associated with skin defects, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis  and predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma   <cit> . r-spondin <dig> is a member of a recently identified small gene family of secreted molecules potentially acting via the fzd/lrp receptors ; a pathway previously described for the wnt secreted factors  <cit> . binding to these fzd/lrp receptors induces beta-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and eventually its nuclear translocation where it is engaged in gene activation through its association with t-cell factor  transcription factors  <cit> .

in this study, the expression profiles of the four r-spondin members was determined during the development of goat gonads. their expression was also assessed in xx sex-reversed pis-/- gonads at different developmental stages. surprisingly, expression of rspo <dig> seems more sensitive than that of rspo <dig> to pis sex-reversal. moreover, using a rspo1-specific antibody  <cit> , we show that goat rspo <dig> is localized in the cortical part of the developing ovary where most of the germ cells lies.

RESULTS
goat rspo <dig> cdna characterization and phylogenic conservation
the entire open reading frame of goat rspo <dig> cdna  has been isolated by rt-pcr with primers  derived from regions of the bovine sequence that are highly conserved in human. in order to determine the initiation start site and the promoter used in the female gonad, 5'-race experiments were carried out on  <dig> dpc goat ovaries mrna. a unique initiation site has been found  <dig> bp upstream of the conserved atg initiator codon . this initiation start site lies just downstream of a 10-bp polyg-tail that is present in goat genomic dna  and no transcript 5' to this polyg-tail were detected despite several attempts. thus, surprisingly, the goat ovarian transcript does not use the conserved ag acceptor splicing site, located  <dig> bp upstream of the atg as observed in bovine  and human  . consequently, in  <dig> dpc goat ovaries the first exon of the rspo <dig> gene includes the atg initiator codon, whereas in human and bovine, the exon encompassing the first codon can be exon <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  depending on the number of rspo <dig> untranslated 5' exons . in conclusion, the precise location of the promoter of the rspo <dig> gene appears to be variable due to the potential existence of different tissue-specific promoting regions .

in order to confirm that the goat rspo <dig> cdna sequence corresponds to the correct r-spondin gene, a phylogenetic tree was built with several sequences of the r-spondin family belonging to different mammalian species. the nj tree built with the four r-spondin genes, belonging to seven mammalian species, is depicted in fig. 1b. as expected, the goat rspo <dig> sequence characterized in this work, belongs to the rspo <dig> cluster, being more closely related with the bovine sequence.

the sequence of the pcr products obtained for the three other r-spondin genes have been determined and compared with the bovine and human genomes to ascertain their affiliation .

r-spondin gene expression in normal goat gonad development
r-spondin gene expression profiles were determined during goat gonad development by rt-pcr with specific primers . interestingly, both rspo <dig> and rspo <dig> show a female-specific expressional profile from the crucial  <dig> dpc stage to adulthood, as observed for foxl <dig>  however, some slight differences exist between rspo <dig> and rspo <dig> gene regulation. firstly, each gene reaches its higher level of expression at different developmental stages, before germ cell meiosis  for rspo <dig> and at the time of follicle formation for rspo <dig> . secondly, in contrast to what observed in mice, our data suggest that rspo <dig> is also expressed in both male and female mesonephroi .

rspo <dig> is similarly expressed in xx and xy gonads while rspo <dig> was faintly expressed from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc, with a female-specific sex-dimorphic pattern.

r-spondin gene expression in xx sex-reversed goat gonads
in order to understand if the pis mutation affects the pattern of expression of rspo <dig> or of the other r-spondin genes during gonadal differentiation, the expression profiles of the four r-spondin genes were determined in sex-reversed versus normal gonads. we have previously shown that the crucial stages in the goat sex-reversal pathology are between  <dig> and  <dig> dpc  <cit> . briefly, at  <dig> dpc, even if no sex-reversal defect can be noticed by histology on xx pis-/- gonads, a dramatic decrease of cyp <dig> gene expression is detectable. cyp <dig> has been identified as a direct ovarian-specific target of foxl <dig>  <cit> . at  <dig> dpc, sox <dig> and amh expressions have increased and masculinization is clearly detectable by histology  <cit> .

interestingly, even if rspo <dig> expression seems to be slightly decreased in xx pis-/- gonads at  <dig> dpc, its level of expression in xx sex-reversed gonads remains comparable to that seen in normal female at  <dig> dpc . in contrast, rspo <dig> expression appears to be significantly lower in xx sex-reversed gonads compared to xx normal ovaries at all three tested stages . indeed, rspo <dig> mrna levels are similar to those detected in xy control male testes . interestingly, at  <dig> dpc, a faint but higher mrna levels of rspo <dig> and rspo <dig> can be detected in sex-reversed gonads from xx male with genital ambiguities  as compared to those of fully masculinized xx or xy males. although 50% of xx pis-/- sex-reversed gonad develops as testes inducing complete masculinization of the external genitalia, the remaining 50% develops as ovo-testis associated with external genital ambiguities  <cit> . it is thus tempting to speculate that the remaining detectable rspo <dig> and rspo <dig> expression comes from the ovarian part of these hermaphrodite xx pis-/- gonads.

as described above, rspo <dig> appears to be ubiquitously expressed and not affected by the pis mutation. at  <dig> dpc, rspo <dig> begins to be very faintly expressed specifically in normal ovaries, but not in xx sex-reversed or xy testes .

immunodetection of rspo <dig> protein in transfected cos <dig> cells
rspo <dig> transcript analysis revealed that goat mrna contains two possible starting codons  that may produce proteins with or without a signal peptide, respectively. in order to establish the stability and cellular sub-localization of the two putative proteins, we produced two constructs, one containing both potential initiation codons , and the other retaining only the atg <dig> . in order to evaluate the specificity of anti-hrspo <dig>  antibody  in goat, both immunohistochemistry and western blot were performed on cos <dig> cells transfected  with rspo <dig> cdna constructs .

nu- <dig> anti-hrspo <dig> antibody appeared to be highly specific since no signal was detected in non-transfected cells . double immunofluorescence studies were carried out for rspo <dig> and pdi , an abundant soluble resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . as expected, the full-length protein rspo1-atg <dig> was localized both in the er with pdi and on the cell membrane . when the first atg codon was missing  the resulting protein was detected in the nucleus, highlighting the efficiency of the putative nuclear localization signal . by western blot analyses, a  <dig> kda protein was detected as expected on protein extracts of cos <dig> cell transfected with the full-lenght rspo <dig> cdna . bands of higher molecular mass were also visible suggesting post-translational modifications of the protein. moreover, the rspo1-atg <dig> protein was detected in the culture medium when heparin is added, and the secreted form corresponds to the most post-translationally modified one .

ovarian localization of rspo <dig> at different developmental stages
to obtain highlight on the function of rspo <dig> during goat ovarian development, we studied its cellular and sub-cellular localization at three critical stages of gonad development,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpc, and compared with those of foxl <dig> and c-kit. at the earliest 36– <dig> dpc stages, rspo <dig> was found to be mainly localized in the cortical area of the female gonads . at these stages, foxl <dig> positive cells were mainly localized in the ovarian sub-cortical region. interestingly, the cortical rspo <dig> positive area contains the majority of the germ cells that express c-kit; but rspo <dig> appears localized around both somatic and germinal cells . sub-cellular localization of rspo <dig> was within the cell membrane, resembling those of c-kit. at  <dig> dpc, the strongest rspo <dig> specific signal was found around the germ cells, that are easily recognizable by their round and voluminous nuclei . double immunofluorescence experiments carried out for rspo <dig> and c-kit confirm the localization of both proteins on germ cell membranes . moreover, in situ hybridization performed on  <dig> dpc ovaries shows that both somatic and germinal cells expressed the rspo <dig> gene . intriguingly, at the  <dig> dpc stage, rspo <dig> protein shows a punctuated staining that is not visible at the  <dig> dpc stage . interestingly at the  <dig> dpc stage, rspo <dig> staining appears quite similar to those obtained with anti-wnt <dig> and anti-β-catenin specific antibodies . on another hand, no rspo <dig> staining has been observed on male gonads of the same stages, but epithelial cells of the mesonephros has been found positively stained .

rspo <dig> localization in xx sex-reversed gonads at  <dig> dpc
in order to get a better understanding of the different levels of rspo <dig> expression between xx male with ambiguities  and xx male without ambiguity  noticed in rt-pcr experiments, rspo <dig> protein localization was analyzed on gonadal sections of both fetuses . amh and c-kit detections clearly show that testis from the "pure" xx male is more developed than those of the xx male with ambiguities; seminiferous tubules are more differentiated and delineated and there are more c-kit positive leydig cells in testis of  <dig> compared with those of  <dig> . interestingly, rspo <dig> staining specifically remains on isolated germ cell  or on germ cell colonies  located in the cortical region, outside the testicular sub-cortical area. accordingly with the differences noticed on rspo <dig> mrna levels, the number of germ cell colonies located outside the seminiferous tubules is clearly increased in the  <dig> gonad as compared with the  <dig> one . on these germ cell colonies, the punctuated rspo <dig> staining remains evident and clearer than in ovaries where the cellular density is higher. using confocal microscopy, the punctuated staining appears as patches located on the germ cell membranes, with many small patches and one or two big patches  per cell . a similar rspo <dig> punctuated staining was observed on germ cells lying in the cortical part of normal ovaries, before  and during  meiosis .

discussion
rspo <dig> protein structure
an intriguing structural feature of all r-spondin proteins is to display an n-terminal signal peptide and a conserved c-terminal putative nuclear localization signal. thus, although these proteins have been reported to function as secreted molecules acting on receptors located across the cell membranes  <cit> , they might also localize in the nucleus and in fact their predicted sub-cellular localization is in the nucleus  <cit> . it is thus possible that either the c-terminal basic domain is not a nuclear localization signal but plays a functional role in the secreted proteins, or that r-spondin isoforms lacking the n-terminal signal peptide do exist and play a role in the nucleus. interestingly, a minor isoform, coding for a protein lacking the signal peptide has been reported in humans but not in mice  <cit> . here we show that the goat rspo <dig> transcript presents an in frame atg codon located fifteen amino acids downstream of the initiator codon. remarkably, human rspo <dig>   <dig>   <dig> genes also present a second putative initiator codon at positions  <dig> or  <dig>  and these second atg are conserved in different mammals .

in order to establish the stability and cellular sub-localization of both putative proteins, we produced and analyzed by cell transfection two constructs with or without the signal peptide. the atg <dig> construct encodes a secreted rspo <dig> protein associated with the cell surface, probably and as previously described by other by binding heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix  <cit> . indeed, we detected goat rspo <dig> in the culture medium of transfected cos <dig> cells only after heparin addition . by contrast, the goat rspo <dig> protein translated from the second putative initiator codon  is found in the nucleus of transfected cos <dig> cells , as previously shown for a mouse flag-tagged rspo <dig> protein  <cit> . according to this feature, the synthesis of r-spondin proteins without a signal peptide located in the nucleus cannot be excluded. either these putative isoforms could arise from a translational event that uses the second initiator codon, or from differential splicing events as described for the human rspo <dig> gene  <cit> . nevertheless, a role of these r-spondin proteins within the nuclear compartment remains to be demonstrated in vivo. indeed, in our present studies on goat gonads, rspo <dig> protein was never detected in the nucleus.

rspo <dig> is not downstream of foxl <dig> in ovarian differentiation
homozygous mutations of rspo <dig> have been found to be responsible for an xx sex-reversed phenotype in human  <cit> . the only other reported loss-of-function mutation leading to xx sex-reversal in mammals is the pis mutation in goat. the pis regulatory mutation leads to a transcriptional silencing of at least three genes in goat ovaries, foxl <dig>  pfoxic and pisrt <dig>  <cit> . foxl <dig> is the unique classical pis-regulated gene and encodes for a transcription factor responsible for bpes in heterozygous mutated patients   <cit> . intriguingly, both rspo <dig>  foxl <dig> and pis mutations are also associated with failure of epithelium differentiation at different specific position, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis in rspo1-/- patients, eyelids malformation in foxl2+/- patients and hornless in pis-/- goats. another common feature is the absence of obvious testicular phenotype in xy homozygous mutants  <cit> .

the major objective of this study was to establish if the pis mutation influence the pattern of expression of rspo <dig> during ovarian differentiation. by using both rt-pcr and immuno fluorescence, we have shown that transcription of rspo <dig> is not regulated by foxl <dig> or other pis-regulated genes. rspo <dig> expression is not affected at  <dig> dpc when masculinization occurs in xx sex-reversed gonads. in addition, rspo <dig> positive cells are located in the ovarian cortex, a region where foxl <dig> is not expressed at  <dig> dpc. it is thus possible that either foxl <dig> and rspo <dig> belong to two different ovarian pathways, or that foxl <dig> expression is regulated by rspo <dig>  mouse carrying null mutations for rspo <dig> will probably clarify this last point, but until now, as no eyelids phenotype has been shown in human rspo1-/- patients, it seems improbable that rspo <dig> regulates foxl <dig>  consequently, the rspo <dig> anti-testis action is likely to be independent from the foxl <dig> one, suggesting that different anti-testes genes act in different cell types to ensure proper ovarian differentiation and maintenance. ottolenghi and collaborators have recently exposed this theoretical view  <cit> , reinforced by the present study and by their recent results on mice carrying null alleles for both foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> genes  <cit> .

relationships between rspo <dig> and the wnt genes
it has been proposed that r-spondins may synergize with the wnt proteins, both acting through the β-catenin pathway  <cit> . among the wnt family, wnt <dig> has been shown to be an important factor for gonad differentiation  <cit> . interestingly in our model, rspo <dig> and wnt <dig> expressional profiles are similar. their levels of expression are not decreased in  <dig> dpc xx pis-/- gonads, and remain detectable in sex-reversed gonads of xx male with ambiguities compared to those of xx male without ambiguity, at  <dig> or  <dig> dpc  <cit> . moreover, wnt <dig> protein distribution on goat gonads appeared highly similar to that of rspo <dig>  being present in the cortical area in early 36– <dig> dpc stages , and mainly associated with the germ cell membranes at the  <dig> dpc stage . although these two genes seem to belong to the same anti-testis pathway, their molecular mechanisms of action could be slightly different. indeed, a recent study on hek- <dig> cells demonstrated that rspo <dig> regulates wnt signaling by acting on the co-receptor lrp <dig> levels on the cell surface  <cit> . accordingly, no relocation of wnt <dig> protein has been observed at the germ cell surface .

rspo <dig> is a candidate gene for ovarian differentiation
interestingly, we found that another r-spondin gene, rspo <dig> has a female specific sex-dimorphic expression pattern and that its expression is affected in xx pis-/- gonads. rspo <dig> expression level decreases as early as  <dig> dpc and remains low at  <dig> and  <dig> dpc, a situation highly similar to that observed for the cyp <dig> gene previously shown to be a direct target of foxl <dig> in goat and tilapia  <cit> . these results suggest that rspo <dig> could represent a direct target of foxl <dig> in early developing goat ovaries. although rspo <dig> ovarian localization and rspo <dig> promoter studies are needed to assess a putative direct transcriptional activation of rspo <dig> by foxl <dig>  rspo <dig> can be considered as a good candidate gene for premature ovarian failure and xx sex-reversal in human.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study brings evidences that rspo <dig> could have a role correlated with germ cell differentiation and maintenance before and during meiosis. if the first ovarian differentiation failure occurs on the germ cell lineage in human xx rspo1-/- sex-reversed patients, the physiopathology of this disease will be clearly different from those observed in xx pis-/- sex-reversed goats, for which the primary defect has been localized on supporting cells  <cit> . by contrast, xx sex-reversal in pigs seems to be linked to a failure of the germ cell maintenance  <cit>  and could result from a mutational event in a gene belonging to the r-spondin or wnt pathways. conclusively, it becomes now more evident that different somatic cellular types exist in early differentiating goat ovaries and that different anti-testis pathways should be active in these different cell types in order to ensure proper ovarian differentiation.
