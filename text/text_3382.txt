BACKGROUND
pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive, and usually untreatable group of chronic disorders and appears to be regulated by complex cellular processes
 <cit> . in animal models, a single intratracheal administration of bleomycin induces an inflammatory response that is characterized by leukocyte infiltration, apoptosis, fibroblast proliferation, matrix metalloproteinase /tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  imbalance, and an increase in interstitial collagen content
 <cit>  that can culminate in the development of pulmonary lesions similar to those observed in human interstitial pulmonary fibrosis 
 <cit> . however, the exact mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear.

ap- <dig> is a dimeric transcription factor, mainly comprised of the jun , fos , and atf  families of b-zip transcription factors. ap- <dig> binds to the tpa response element  and regulates target gene expression in response to various pro-oxidants and toxicants. these gene products mediate  oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, as well as cell growth and tumorigenesis
 <cit> . the promoters of many inflammatory response genes, especially those encoding cytokines and chemokines, have functional ap- <dig> binding sites
 <cit> . fra- <dig> regulates gene expression involved in various processes such as cell growth and cell death and regulates the expression of genes controlling tissue/cell remodeling, such as mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and mmp- <dig>  mainly at the transcriptional level
 <cit> . we have recently shown that fra-1-deficient  mice are more susceptible than wild-type  mice to bleomycin-induced fibrosis
 <cit> , suggesting that this transcription factor is involved in the regulation of complex genetic networks to maintain cellular homeostasis during bleomycin-induced lung inflammation, injury, and repair processes. based on these results, we hypothesized that accelerated inflammation and fibrosis observed in fra-1∆/∆ mice are caused by enhanced inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression. to test this hypothesis and to better understand the mechanisms by which the fra- <dig> transcription factor confers pulmonary protection, we have performed microarray analysis to examine the changes in gene expression in the lungs of fra-1∆/∆ mice after treatment with bleomycin. in the present study, we have evaluated changes in early inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene expression after 5 days of bleomycin treatment. our mrna expression profiling demonstrated increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses and decreased levels of apoptotic genes in fra-1∆/∆ mice, suggesting that the fra- <dig> transcription factor dampens the development of late fibrotic injury by modulating the early pro-fibrotic responses.

RESULTS
genes that encode cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors
the set of genes that was differentially expressed between pbs-treated fra-1+/+ and fra-1∆/∆ mice was studied in order to identify those genes for which a genotypic difference in expression exists. we found that the loss of fra- <dig> led to an up-regulation of chemokine  ligand  <dig>  and interleukin  <dig> alpha  expression. similarly, we found a down-regulation of chemokine  ligand  <dig>  and chemokine  ligand  <dig>  in fra-1∆/∆ mice when compared to fra-1+/+ mice . next, we compared the differentially up-regulated genes between bleomycin-treated fra-1∆/∆ and fra-1+/+ mice . the genes that showed a -fold change of ≥ <dig>  were selected for analysis. interestingly, our data suggested that the lack of fra- <dig> leads to up-regulation of cytokines and chemokines in response to bleomycin, including interleukin- <dig> alpha , interleukin- <dig> receptor alpha chain , interleukin  <dig> receptor, beta chain , interleukin  <dig> , chemokine  ligand  <dig> , and c-x-c motif chemokine  <dig> , whereas fra-1+/+ mice showed an up-regulation of interleukin  <dig> receptor, type ii . these results suggest that fra- <dig> signaling controls the expression of some of the genes that are involved in fibrosis. for instance, expression of interleukin  <dig>  a cytokine that promotes greater inflammation and fibrosis
 <cit> , was significantly higher in bleomycin-treated fra-1∆/∆ mice  than in fra-1+/+ mice . also, we noted that fra-1+/+ mice showed an increased expression of il1r <dig>  in response to bleomycin as compared to fra-1∆/∆ mice. interleukin  <dig> , a principal pro-inflammatory cytokine that includes two ligands  and two cell surface receptors namely il1r <dig> and il1r <dig>  several reports suggest that binding of il <dig> to il1r <dig> ultimately leads to the activation of several genes, including those encoding cyclooxygenase, nitricoxide synthase, cell adhesion molecules and cytokines and chemokines
 <cit> . more importantly, in mouse models, exogenous administration of recombinant il1β induced high degree of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, and specific blockade of il1r <dig> markedly reduced bleomycin-induced inflammation
 <cit> . due to the lack of a cytoplasmic-signaling domain for il1r <dig>  this receptor mainly acts as a decoy receptor to prevent il1-mediated biological responses
 <cit> . many anti-inflammatory mediators enhance the expression and release of il1r <dig> to induce anti-il <dig> pathway
 <cit> . the increased il1r <dig> expression in fra-1+/+ but not in fra-1∆/∆ mice suggests that fra- <dig> controls bleomycin-induced inflammation by augmenting the expression of anti-inflammatory genes. in the bleomycin-induced fibrosis model, extensive neovascularization has often been observed to follow the airways and sites of injury
 <cit> . presence/absence of erl motif in cxc chemokines dictates their angiogenic property
 <cit> . the amount of cxcl <dig> chemokine in the lungs has been directly correlated with the degree of fibrosis
 <cit> . administration of cxcl <dig> to bleomycin-treated mice attenuates pulmonary fibrosis in part due to reduced angiogenesis
 <cit> . however, we found that bleomycin-induced fra-1∆/∆ mice showed a  <dig> -fold increase in cxcl <dig> when compared to fra-1+/+ mice .

we then analyzed genes that are uniquely expressed in either fra-1+/+  or fra-1∆/∆ mice  after bleomycin treatment. the fra-1∆/∆ mice showed an up-regulation of chemokine  ligand  <dig> , macrophage-derived chemokine , chemokine  ligand  <dig> , chemokine  ligand  <dig> , chemokine  receptor  <dig> , chemokine  receptor  <dig>  and chemokine  receptor  <dig>  , whereas fra-1+/+ mice showed an up-regulation of chemokine  receptor  <dig> , interleukin  <dig> family, member  <dig> , chemokine  ligand  <dig> , colony stimulating factor  <dig> receptor, alpha, low-affinity  and interleukin  <dig> receptor-like  <dig>  . of particular interest is the ccl <dig> chemokine, which has been recognized as a th <dig> chemokine, and its involvement in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis has been documented. belperio et al. have demonstrated that ccl <dig> and its receptor, ccr <dig>  are overexpressed in a mouse model of belomycin-induced fibrosis
 <cit> . ccl <dig> and ccr <dig> levels are also increased in patients with ipf, and their expression has been detected on epithelium and macrophages, respectively
 <cit> . neutralization of ccl <dig> and ccr <dig> has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in lung inflammation during bleomycin-induced fibrosis
 <cit> . interestingly, our results here showed that the expression of ccl <dig> and ccr <dig> was significantly increased  in bleomycin-treated fra-1∆/∆ mice when compared to fra-1+/+ mice.

next, we analyzed genes that are uniquely down-regulated in bleomycin-treated fra-1∆/∆ mice , which included chemokine  receptor-like  <dig> , bone morphogenetic protein  <dig> , and bone morphogenetic protein  <dig> . similarly, fra-1+/+ also showed uniquely down-regulated genes, including chemokine  receptor  <dig> , chemokine  ligand 21a , chemokine  ligand 27a  and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor  . taken together, the results of the present study have revealed that genetic disruption of fra- <dig> differentially regulates a number of cytokines and chemokines in response to bleomycin, indicating a potential role for fra- <dig> in cytokine and chemokine signaling during bleomycin-induced acute lung injury.

genes encoding proteins that are involved in the inflammatory response
in fra-1∆/∆ mice treated with vehicle, we found up-regulation of some genes involved in the inflammatory response  when compared to their fra-1+/+ counterparts. these genes included regenerating islet-derived  <dig> gamma , cathepsin e , serine peptidase inhibitor, clade a, member 1b  and serum amyloid a <dig> . on the other hand, the lack of fra- <dig> led to the down-regulation of the expression of a few genes, including serine peptidase inhibitor, clade a, member 3 m  and nlr family, card domain containing  <dig> . matrix metalloproteases  play key roles in tissue repair and remodelling; but recent studies indicate a prominent role for the lysosomal proteinases, such as cathepsins, in the extracellular remodelling
 <cit> . bal fluid and extracellular space contain secreted cathepsins and their activities are controlled by endogenous inhibitors of cathepsins
 <cit> . likewise, serine peptidases are implicated in various biological processes such as wound healing and they also contribute to the development of pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury
 <cit> . endogenous serine peptidase inhibitors regulate the activities of serine peptidases. imbalance in the activities of proteinases/peptidases and endogenous proteinases/peptidases inhibitors may contribute to deregulated protein degradation and resulting in the initiation of lung injury
 <cit> . serum amyloid a is an acute phase protein, induced by several inflammatory mediators and its serum level is elevated in various conditions like copd
 <cit> , bronchial carcinoma
 <cit> , and cardiovascular disease
 <cit> . thus, it is likely that fra- <dig> distinctly regulates proteinases/peptidases and their inhibitor’s expression to maintain lung homeostasis.

when we compared the gene expression patterns of fra-1∆/∆ mice and their fra-1+/+ littermates following bleomycin treatment, it was evident that there were many more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes involved in inflammation in the lungs of fra-1∆/∆ mice when compared to their fra-1+/+counterparts . we identified differential expression of genes that belong to the immunoglobulin family, specifically immunoglobulin joining chain  and immunoglobulin heavy constant mu  in fra-1∆/∆ mice treated with bleomycin . it has previously been shown that immunoglobulin concentrations are increased in immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis
 <cit> , inflammatory bowel disease
 <cit> , and some respiratory disorders including asthma
 <cit> , cystic fibrosis
 <cit> , and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
 <cit> . the up-regulation of immunoglobulin genes was also accompanied by an up-regulation of several genes involved in antigen presentation and antigen binding. this was true for some of the major histocompatibility genes, including histocompatibility  <dig> , histocompatibility  <dig>  class ii, locus mb <dig> , histocompatibility  <dig>  t region locus  <dig> , and histocompatibility  <dig>  q region locus  <dig>  . complement components such as complement factor d , and antigens such as cd79a antigen , cd <dig> antigen , and cd <dig> antigen  were differentially up-regulated in fra-1∆/∆ mice . the expression of other inflammatory genes, including regenerating islet-derived  <dig> gamma  and serum amyloid a  <dig> , was also differentially up-regulated in fra-1∆/∆ mice treated with bleomycin . the reg3g and saa <dig> genes have now been consistently associated with pulmonary fibrosis and chronic inflammation
 <cit> . on the other hand, we also noticed down-regulation of some genes in fra-1∆/∆ mice, such as solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig> , s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig> , and cathepsin e  , when compared to fra-1+/+ mice. again, we analyzed genes that are uniquely expressed in either fra-1∆/∆  or fra-1+/+  mice in response to bleomycin. the results showed that major histocompatibility molecules such as histocompatibility  <dig>  q region locus  <dig> , mhc class i like protein gs <dig> , and complement components such as complement component 4b  were uniquely up-regulated in fra-1∆/∆ mice treated with bleomycin . in contrast, we found down-regulation of immunoglobulin heavy constant mu , histocompatibility  <dig>  o region beta locus , cd <dig> antigen , and complement receptor  <dig>  in fra-1+/+ mice after bleomycin treatment. our previous study demonstrated that fra-1∆/∆ mice showed increased levels of inflammation after bleomycin treatment
 <cit> . thus, our present data suggest that deregulation of the expression of immune response genes in fra-1∆/∆ mice is the likely cause of the increased lung inflammation in fra-1∆/∆ mice.

genes that encode extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules
the unique gene expression pattern in fra-1+/+ mice  treated with bleomycin suggested an increase in the expression of genes that encode extracellular matrix, such as collagen, type iv, alpha  <dig> , collagen, type iv, alpha  <dig> , collagen, type vi, alpha  <dig> , collagen, type vi, alpha  <dig> , collagen, type vi, alpha  <dig> , collagen, type xv, alpha  <dig> , a disintegrin-like and metallopeptidase  with thrombospondin type  <dig> motif,  <dig> , and a disintegrin-like and metallopeptidase  with thrombospondin type  <dig> motif,  <dig> . in contrast, fra-1∆/∆ mice showed increased expression levels of laminin, alpha  <dig> .

among the various collagens, types i and iii collagens are the most widely distributed in both airways and parenchymal structures
 <cit> . to maintain normal structural properties of lung, the controlled distribution of these proteins is vital and their inappropriate accumulation in fibrotic lungs has been reported
 <cit> . in contrast, the physiologic functions and abnormal deposition patterns of other collagens in the lung fibrosis are poorly understood. our recent study showed an increased expression of the tgf-β <dig> and type-1-collagen genes in response to bleomycin at the end of  <dig> and 31 days of bleomycin treatment and demonstrated the presence of increased fibrosis in fra-1∆/∆ mice
 <cit> . however, we did not observe any differences in the expression levels of type i collagen or type iii collagen, nor did we observe altered tgf-β <dig> gene expression in either genotype at the end of 5 days bleomycin treatment. it has been reported that excessive synthesis and deposition of ecm proteins is a general tissue response to an unresolved chronic inflammation
 <cit> . hence, we speculate that the persistence of increased inflammation in fra-1∆/∆ mice is driven by the loss of fra- <dig>  while higher levels of fibrotic gene expression in the fibrotic stage  may contribute to the excessive deposition of ecm and disease severity seen in fra-1∆/∆ mice. this point needs to be addressed in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the increased fibrosis in fra-1∆/∆ mice.

we found that a few genes known to be involved in general cell adhesion are affected by bleomycin treatment in fra-1∆/∆ mice . glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule  <dig> , cd <dig> antigen , sialic acid binding ig-like lectin e , and integrin alpha m  were differentially expressed in fra-1∆/∆ mice treated with bleomycin when compared to fra-1+/+ mice. in general, the expression of intercellular adhesion molecules is increased by inflammatory signals, which facilitates lymphocytes for higher adhesion and permeation into inflamed tissues. it has been shown that the glycam <dig> molecule is strongly expressed in inflammatory processes in order to modulate leukocyte trafficking
 <cit> . sialic acids present on the surface of all mammalian cells and play important roles in physiological and pathological processes, and their expression has been reported to decrease during immune cell activation
 <cit> . consistent with these findings, we also noted an up-regulation in the expression of glycam <dig> and a loss of siglece in fra-1∆/∆ mice when compared to fra-1+/+mice.

we then analyzed the genes that are uniquely expressed in fra-1∆/∆  or fra-1+/+ mice . fra-1∆/∆ mice showed unique expression of genes that included major histocompatibility molecules such as histocompatibility  <dig>  q region locus  <dig> , histocompatibility  <dig>  t region locus  <dig> , histocompatibility  <dig>  k <dig> region , laminin alpha  <dig> , and heparanase . fra-1+/+ mice showed unique expression of mesothelin , neuron-glia-cam-related cell adhesion molecule , and a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain  <dig> . heparanase is an endoglucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate  chains, resulting in hs fragments of  <dig> to  <dig> sugar units
 <cit> . overexpression of heparanase has been reported in numerous tumors, where it regulates angiogenesis and metastasis
 <cit> . furthermore, the adam gene family is associated with proteolytic, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interaction-promoting activities. several investigations have shown a functional role for adams in collagen deposition in cells and in lungs in which the adam gene was knocked down, thus revealing the functional dysregulation of this gene family in the lung fibrosis
 <cit> . thus, an alteration in the expression of cell adhesion molecules may represent another potential mechanism by which more fibrosis can occur in fra-1∆/∆ mice.

fra-1-regulated genes involved in programmed cell death
the process of programmed cell death is known to play a major role in maintaining many biological processes, and inappropriate apoptosis can lead to disease conditions, either because cells experience an inappropriately prolonged survival or they die prematurely
 <cit> . studies using genetic models have demonstrated both cooperative and antagonistic roles of ap- <dig> family of proteins in modulating cell death in response to a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli. for example, c-jun-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts  and liver cells show increased levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis
 <cit> . likewise, c-fos also participates in both pro- and anti-apoptotic activities. for example, c-fos-/- mefs undergo apoptosis when cultured in vitro and also display an increased susceptibility to uv-induced cell death
 <cit> . overexpression of fra- <dig> also inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, and reduces the tumorigenicity of c <dig> glioma cells
 <cit> . consistent with a role for fra- <dig> in apoptosis, we recently found that mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking fra- <dig> show an increased resistance to oxidant-induced cell death
 <cit> . fra- <dig> appears to uniquely up-regulate some genes modulating apoptosis in fra-1+/+ mice , including paternally expressed  <dig> , the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 10b , axl receptor tyrosine kinase , eph receptor a <dig> , zinc finger matrin type  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig>  , and egl nine homolog  <dig> . similarly, fra-1∆/∆ mice showed  up-regulation of glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit  and down-regulation of lectin, galactose binding, soluble  <dig> , eph receptor a <dig> , and arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase . it has been reported that kaempferol exerts an anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects in hei-oc <dig> cells treated with cisplatin through enhancing gclc expression
 <cit> . consistent with this observation, we found that gclc was induced in fra-1∆/∆ mice. our gene expression results from fra-1∆/∆ mice are therefore in good agreement with the observation that inappropriate apoptosis can lead to exaggerated lung fibrosis.

validation of microarray data
amongst several genes that were significantly affected by bleomycin, we randomly selected  <dig> genes according to the microarray results to confirm their differential expression by qrt-pcr. we confirmed that bleomycin treatment significantly induced the expression of il1a, irf <dig>  reg3g, and ccr <dig> and reduced the expression of s100a <dig> in fra-1∆/∆ mice when compared to similarly treated fra-1+/+ mice . these results confirmed the expression patterns of the microarrays. next, we analyzed the genes that were uniquely expressed in both genotypes. the results revealed that fbln <dig> expression was significantly higher in fra-1+/+ mice treated with bleomycin than in the vehicle-treated control group ; however, there was no difference observed in fra-1∆/∆ mice. similarly, fra-1∆/∆ mice treated with bleomycin also showed significantly increased expression of hpse, gclc, runx <dig>  xcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> when compared to the vehicle-treated group, but no differences were observed with their wild-type counterparts. these results further confirmed the expression patterns of the microarrays. according to the qrt-pcr results, there was a tendency for increased expression of ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> in the fra-1∆/∆ mice treated with bleomycin as compared to the vehicle-treated mice, but the differences were not significant. similarly, wild-type mice treated with bleomycin showed greater expression of col4a <dig> and tnfrsf10b than did the vehicle controls. while these qrt-pcr results agree in general direction with the trends measured by microarray, the results did not reach statistical significance. comparison of microarray and qrt-pcr results revealed discordance in  <dig> of the  <dig> genes selected. in the case of marco, microarray analysis revealed no change in marco expression in fra-1+/+ mice but a significant increase in bleomycin-treated  fra-1+/+ mice when compared to vehicle-treated mice, as assayed by qrt-pcr. in the second case, the microarray results showed no change in the expression of snai <dig> in fra-1+/+ mice, but the real-time rt-pcr results indicated a significant decrease  in expression in these mice. the discordance in these two genes may be explained by the lower sensitivity of the microarrays.

analysis of selected microarray genes at different time points after bleomycin treatment
to identify the time course of gene induction by bleomycin, we analyzed samples at different time points for selected genes. all the genes that were used for microarray validation were also used for our analysis of temporal patterns of gene expression . the results revealed that most of the genes continued to show no significant differences between fra-1+/+ and fra-1∆/∆ at  <dig> and 14 days after bleomycin treatment. however, some of the genes were predominantly up-regulated  or down-regulated  in fra-1∆/∆ mice only at 7 days following bleomycin treatment, when compared to the vehicle-treated control and fra-1+/+ mice. we were further interested in the delayed response of some of the genes involved in lung fibrosis that did not exhibit significant differences in microarray results at 5 days . the results revealed a significant difference in the induction of c-c chemokines such as ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> between fra-1+/+ and fra-1∆/∆ mice: fra-1∆/∆ mice showed significantly elevated expression at 7 days following bleomycin treatment when compared to wild-type mice. interestingly, excessive production of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> has been shown to aid the development of pulmonary fibrosis
 <cit> . in addition to the up-regulation of ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  we observed a marked down-regulation of il <dig> and il <dig> in bleomycin-treated fra-1∆/∆ mice. previous studies have reported that in vivo il- <dig> gene delivery before
 <cit>  and after bleomycin
 <cit>  administration suppresses the development of pulmonary fibrosis. finally, fibroblast transdifferentiation has been shown to contribute to the pathology of pulmonary fibrosis. therefore, we analyzed the expression of α-sma, a marker for myofibroblasts. the results revealed that fra-1∆/∆ mice treated with bleomycin had a significantly higher expression of α-sma than did vehicle-treated control or fra-1+/+ mice at 14 days. this result further supports the enhanced susceptibility of fra-1-null mice to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.

CONCLUSIONS
the factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis include persistent inflammation, generation of pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic and angiogenic mediators, alveolar epithelial cell injury, fibroblast differentiation, and poor apoptotic activity of the myofibroblasts. these deregulated cellular processes eventually lead to excessive deposition of extracellular collagen and pathological fibrosis
 <cit> . the present mrna expression profiling analysis has revealed an important role for fra- <dig> in regulating components of complex regulatory networks controlling the lung injury and fibrosis. we found that fra-1∆/∆ mice displayed some of the factors that contribute to pulmonary fibrosis, such as increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and decreased expression of genes involving in apoptotic process during bleomycin treatment. thus, we propose that strategies enhancing fra- <dig> functions may represent a promising approach to mitigate pulmonary fibrosis.
