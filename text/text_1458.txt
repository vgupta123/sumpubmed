BACKGROUND
enterobacter  sakazakii is considered a food borne pathogen that can cause severe illness and death in newborns, particularly in prematures or infants with weakened immune system  <cit> . pathogenesis involves bacteraemia and/or sepsis, cerebro spinal fluid infection and meningitis, intracerebral infarctions, brain abscess or cyst formation, and has been associated with necrotizing enterocolitis   <cit> . infant mortality rate for e. sakazakii meningitis was reported to be  <dig> –  <dig> %  <cit>  and up to 20% of the newborns develop serious neurological complications following infection  <cit> . nec is characterized by the colonization of the gastrointestinal lumen and is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in newborns  <cit> .

although e. sakazakii has been isolated from a wide variety of foods, including cheese, meat, vegetables, grains, herbs, spices and ultra high heated milk  <cit> , the bulk of research has been concentrated on the presence of the organism in milk-based powdered infant formula  <cit> . a positive correlation between nec and oral formula feeding has been suggested  <cit> .

to assess the pathogenicity of e. sakazakii for humans, evaluation of potential virulence factors is required. however, up to now little is known about the mechanisms of pathogenicity in e. sakazakii. a necessary state in the successful colonization, establishment and ultimately production of disease by microbial pathogens is the ability to adhere to host surfaces such as mucous membranes, gastric and intestinal epithelial or endothelial tissue  <cit> . therefore, it is a common trait of microbial pathogens to express adherence factors responsible for recognizing and binding to specific receptor moieties of cells, thus enabling the bacteria to resist host strategies that would impede colonization. specific adhesion to tissue cells is therefore considered an essential virulence factor for most bacterial pathogens  <cit> .

up to now, only two recent studies have described aspects of the interaction of e. sakazakii with cells. pagotto et al.  <cit>  examined in their work the pathogenesis and potential virulence factors of e. sakazakii clinical and food isolates exploring the suckling mouse assay and cell line experiments. of  <dig> e. sakazakii strains  evaluated, four were found to be positive for enterotoxin production. collando et al.  <cit>  tested the ability of different bifidobacteria to inhibit different pathogen  adhesion and to displace pathogens previously adhering to cells in a human intestinal mucus model.

in this study, we investigated the potential of e. sakazakii strains from various origins to adhere to hep- <dig> and caco- <dig> cells, two well established and frequently used in-vitro models for studying interactions of bacteria with human cells. e. sakazakii can cause a highly lethal syndrome of bacteraemia and meningitis in neonates  <cit>  with an extraordinarily high prevalence of developing a brain abscess  <cit> . like citrobacter diversus or citrobacter freundii, e. sakazakii seems to have a tropism for the central nervous system, implying the organism's ability to breach the blood-brain barrier  <cit> . in an effort to understand the interaction of e. sakazakii with endothelial cells from the brain, the cell line hbmec was used as the in-situ blood-brain barrier model  <cit> .

furthermore, the effects of bacterial culture conditions on the adherence behaviour were included in the study and an attempt was made to characterize the factors involved in adherence of e. sakazakii to mammalian cells. this is the first study providing data on the adherence ability in e. sakazakii strains.

RESULTS
results of the adhesion experiments of the  <dig> e. sakazakii strains on hep- <dig>  caco- <dig> cells and hbmec are summarized in table  <dig>  at least three replicates for all three cell lines were done. according to these results, adhesion was considered positive , when adhesion was observed in all the replicates, ambivalent , when adhesion was observed in one or two of the replicates and negative , when no adhesion was observed in any of the experiments. briefly, positive adhesion was observed for  <dig>  strains on hep- <dig> cells, for  <dig>  strains on caco- <dig> cells and  <dig>  strains on hbmec. adherence was confirmed by tem observations revealing a tight association of bacteria to mammalian cell membranes . sixteen  strains showed ambivalent adhesion to all three cell lines and no adhesion was observed for  <dig>  strains on hep- <dig> cells,  <dig>  strains on caco- <dig> cells and  <dig>  strains on hbmec. nineteen  strains exhibited positive adhesion capacities to all three cell lines,  <dig> strains  to both hep- <dig> and caco- <dig> cells and in four strains  no adhesion was observed on any of the three cell lines. no difference was evident  when adhesion behaviour was compared in view of the origin  of the e. sakazakii strains.

an adhesion index  describing the mean number of bacteria per mammalian cell after examination of  <dig> visual fields was determined .

furthermore, three different adhesion patterns could be distinguished on all three cell lines:  association in clusters containing between  <dig> and > <dig> bacteria  a diffuse adherence in which bacteria are distributed on the entire mammalian cell surface and  a mixture of the two patterns . examples of the diffuse pattern and the adherence in clusters as observed on hep- <dig> cells can be seen in fig.  <dig> 

factors influencing adherence
adhesion assays were performed with a constant number of viable, bacterial cells harvested at different stages of growth . experimental results on the adhesion to hep- <dig> cells indicated that the number of cfu per cm <dig> recovered was at its maximum in the late exponential phase, i. e., with bacteria harvested after  <dig> h of culturing. size of clusters increased when bacteria were collected during the exponential phase and the number of adherent bacteria increased by approx 10-fold. additionally to the clusters, the appearance of an increasing number of diffuse adhering bacteria was observed when bacteria were collected during this phase. after reaching the stationary phase, adhesiveness of bacteria was reduced by half log and remained constant.

when control experiments were carried out using microplates without hep- <dig> cells, bacterial adhesion to the plastic matrix was observed. the mean number of cfu recovered from the matrix was constant  along the growth curve.

furthermore, adhesion of exponential  and stationary phase  cultures of e. sakazakii strain es <dig> to hep- <dig> cells was examined at different mois. the adhesion rate increased with the moi, ranging from  <dig> ×  <dig>  to  <dig> ×  <dig>  per cm <dig> of cell monolayer.

the influence of incubation time on the adhesive behaviour was monitored at a constant moi of 10: <dig>  our observations showed, that instant adherence  occurred and reached its maximum at t =  <dig> min. these results indicate that the factor necessary for bacterial adhesion is already present at a t of  <dig> min on both the host cell and at least in a fraction of the bacteria.

no adherence could be found for glutaraldehyde killed e. sakazakii cells at different mois. in addition, adhesion was not observed when infected hep- <dig> cells were incubated at 4°c, indicating that metabolically active host cells were necessary for the adhesion process.

furthermore, e. sakazakii strain  <dig>  a blood culture isolate causing a fatal case of neonatal meningitis as well as human isolate es <dig>  were selected for growth experiments using  <dig> different media including tsb supplemented with sheep blood. no influence on adhesion was observed on the three cell lines, when the strains were grown in different media without blood. however, for e. sakazakii strain  <dig> grown in tsb supplemented with blood, formation of clusters was observed on hbmec cells . moreover, the number of bacterial cells forming the aggregates increased with increasing concentrations of blood supplemented in the medium. additionally, when the blood component in the medium reached 20%, appearance of diffuse adhering bacteria was observed.

in contrast, reduced adhesion capacity on hep- <dig> cells was observed for strain es <dig> when grown in medium supplemented with blood. interestingly, for both strains adhesion to caco- <dig> cells was not affected by growth in medium supplemented with blood.

due to these unexpected results, all e. sakazakii strains included in the study were grown in blood supplemented tsb medium and adhesion on brain microvascular endothelial cells was examined. significant changes were observed in the adhesive behaviour when some strains were grown in tsb supplemented with blood .

characterization of adhesins
pre-treatment of e. sakazakii strain es <dig> bacteria with trypsin did not impair its adhesion to all three cell lines. furthermore, addition of increasing amounts of mannose to the cell culture medium and bacterial growth medium did not reveal any reductions in adherence to hep- <dig> cells. however, a reduction within the diffuse-adhering fraction of bacteria was observed with increasing mannose concentrations and when mannose concentrations reached 2%, no more diffuse adhering bacteria were observed. the bacterial fraction adhering in clusters, however, remained unchanged during the mannose experiments.

hemagglutination assays on native and tannic acid treated horse erythrocytes revealed negative results for the two e. sakazakii strains tested under the conditions described. tem on lb agar grown e. sakazakii colonies did not reveal the presence of fimbriae-like structures.

discussion
two distinctive adherence patterns could be distinguished. additionally, in a number of strains a mixture of those two patterns could be observed. in several studies, strains of opportunistic pathogens have been classified on the basis of their adherence pattern to tissue culture cells: aggregative patterns and diffuse adhesion  <cit> . the aggregative pattern of adhesion was previously recognized in klebsiella pneumoniae strains associated with neonatal colitis and was found to be most prevalent phenotype in nosocomial strains  <cit> . however, for other organisms , the association of adhesion patterns with different clinical syndromes is still controversial  <cit> . the results from our study showed that most e. sakazakii strains exhibited adhesion in clusters or the mixed pattern, regardless of their origin.

furthermore, several parameters influencing adhesion such as bacterial growth phase, moi and time of incubation were investigated. our results can be summarized as follows:  when added at equal mois, a marginal difference was observed in adhesion when late logarithmic phase cells were used vs stationary-phase.  the number of bacteria adhering to hep- <dig> cells increased with increasing moi and seemed to be limited only by the death of the host cell. microscopic observations showed that both the size and the number of bacterial clusters increased with higher mois. the formation of clusters may take place by the replication of a few attached bacteria, and at higher mois, recruitment of bacteria present in the supernatant in the vicinity of the cell might occur.  adhesion occurs instantly at least for a fraction of the initial bacterial inoculum and increases in a logarithmic manner until an optimum is reached.  both host cells and bacteria have to be alive and metabolically active for adhesion.

the fact that we found reproducible formation of aggregative clusters for some strains, which showed no or ambivalent adherence under standard growth conditions, when grown in broth supplemented with sheep blood, is very interesting.

badger and kim  <cit>  examined the influence of environmental growth conditions to the ability of e. coli k <dig> to invade hbmec. within this study, the influence of environmental ph on e. coli k <dig> invasion of hbmec was discussed. therefore, in our study, the ph was monitored during growth of bacteria in tsb media with and without  blood for e. sakazakii strain es <dig> and  <dig>  during growth the ph decreased from  <dig> – <dig>  to  <dig> – <dig>  in both media, with and without blood. thus, we concluded that the observed changes in the adhesive properties of bacteria grown in blood-supplemented media could not be explained by changes in ph. we therefore suggest that the adhesion behaviour of e. sakazakii strains might be influenced by other components available during growth in blood-supplemented media.

in view of the nature of the adhesive factors involved in the formation of clusters by e. sakazakii to hep- <dig> cells it can be concluded that:  trypsin digestion experiments did not impair the adhesion;  mannose sensitive type  <dig> fimbriae were not involved in cluster adhesion on hep- <dig> cells. the observed decrease in diffuse-adhering bacteria could be explained by the possible presence of mannose sensitive type  <dig> fimbriae within this fraction, suggesting that adhesive behaviour is a multi-factorial process. type  <dig> fimbriae are found in most strains of enterobacteria  <cit> . it is worth mentioning, that together with a very recent study  <cit> , we published more than  <dig> kb of annotated e. sakazakii sequence data originating from a bac library  and among other information the presence of an operon putatively coding for type  <dig> fimbriae was predicted. however, to-date, there is no experimental data confirming the expression of these predicted genes;  haemagglutination experiments using native and tannic acid treated horse erythrocytes suggested that neither type  <dig> nor type  <dig> fimbriae were present under the conditions used. however, in order to confirm these results, experiments should be conducted using a broader range of erythrocytes from various animals  <cit> ;  tem on lb agar grown e. sakazakii colonies did not reveal the presence of fimbriae-like structures; v) tem observations revealed that the bacteria are tightly associated with hep- <dig> cells, suggesting no involvement of fimbrial structures, as has been described for enterotoxigenic e. coli in the study by darfeuille-michaud  <cit>  and  the inclusion of several centrifugation steps  prior to incubation with mammalian cells did not influence the adhesion capacity of the bacteria, suggesting that adhesion in e. sakazakii is not mediated by fragile fimbriae-like organellae.

CONCLUSIONS
adherence experiments show heterogeneity within different e. sakazakii strains. in agreement with studies on e. cloacae  <cit>  we found no relationship between the adhesive capacities of e. sakazakii and the production of specific fimbriae. further studies will have to be carried out in order to determine the adhesin involved in the interaction of e. sakazakii with cells and to enhance knowledge of the pathogenesis of e. sakazakii infection.
