BACKGROUND
positive multi-locus heterozygosity-fitness correlations have been observed in a number of natural populations  <cit> . genome-wide heterozygosity is correlated with inbreeding within a population  <cit>  and heterozygosity-fitness correlations have therefore been associated with inbreeding depression  <cit> . inbreeding may be detrimental to fitness if:  fitness related traits are over-dominant, such that the heterozygous genotype results in greater fitness than either homozygote, or  there are recessive alleles present in the population that result in lower fitness  <cit> . the extent to which the heterozygosity of genetic markers reflects genome-wide heterozygosity and inbreeding is a contentious issue, and heterozygosity-fitness correlations may result from a few loci of major effect in linkage disequilibrium with the genetic markers rather than the effect of inbreeding across the genome  <cit> . however, when large numbers of markers are used, estimates of genome-wide heterozygosity are greatly improved, are more likely to correlate with inbreeding, and are less likely to correlate with the fitness effects of a few loci  <cit> .

inbreeding has been observed to have a negative effect on fitness-related traits in many populations  <cit> , e.g.  <cit> , including some european cattle populations  <cit> . in a number of natural populations susceptibility to infectious disease has been found to be associated with heterozygosity e.g.  <cit>  and inbreeding e.g.  <cit> . infectious disease susceptibility in humans has been found to have a strong genetic component in numerous studies reviewed in  <cit> , with many genes and genetic pathways associated with susceptibility to different diseases. the major histocompatibility complex  is considered to play a significant role in determining susceptibility to various pathogens  <cit> , and mhc-targeted breeding programmes have been suggested for captive populations  <cit> . in one natural population it was found that the effect of a single locus linked to the mhc exceeded the effect of genome-wide heterozygosity on fitness  <cit> .

exotic introgression in a locally adapted population may also reduce fitness. a number of studies have observed a negative effect of introgression on fitness   <cit> . these may result from either  the break-up of co-adapted epistatic interaction between genes, or  the introduction of non-locally adapted alleles  <cit> .

in this study, we tested for associations of heterozygosity and exotic european taurine breed introgression with death and illness due to infectious disease during the first year of life, in a population of east african shorthorn zebu  cattle  from western kenya. more than  <dig> calves were followed for the first year of their life as part of the infectious disease in east african livestock  project  <cit> . the calves were closely monitored throughout; deaths and episodes of clinical illness were reported and followed up by trained veterinary staff. during the study, more than 15% of the calves died, with the majority of deaths due to infectious diseases, most commonly east coast fever, helminth infections, heartwater and trypanosomiasis  <cit> . given the heavy infectious disease burden on these cattle coupled with minimal disease control or treatment, an ability to survive infection is likely to be significantly associated with fitness. furthermore, more than half the surviving calves were reported to have at least one episode of clinical illness during the study period, and almost all these episodes were attributed to infectious disease . we propose that clinical illness is also indicative of a vulnerability to infectious disease that could affect fitness in this environment.

all calves in the ideal population were genotyped using the 50k illumina® bovinesnp <dig> beadchip v.  <dig> . these snps are relatively evenly distributed across the genome, with an average of  <dig>  on each autosome  and  <dig>  on the x chromosome .

the study population was found to be partly introgressed by one or possibly more european taurine breeds  <cit>  . this reflects the effects of a substantial breed improvement programme, involving the crossing of local cattle with european breeds, that took place in the mid-1990s with intermittent cross-breeding thereafter. as a result, approximately 20% of the calves show levels of introgression consistent with crossing with european breeds ≤  <dig> generations ago   <cit> .

we would also expect some inbreeding to occur in this population, since mating is largely unmanaged, there is a relatively low number of breeding bulls, and cattle are generally only transported over short distances . also, historically, this region has experienced major rinderpest epidemics, which have reduced the effective population size of the easz  <cit> . in this study we calculate the genome-wide heterozygosity for the calves in the ideal population using the same snp data set as was used to calculate exotic introgression  <cit> .

in this study we aim to determine whether inbreeding  and outbreeding  affect the likelihood of death or illness due to infectious disease and therefore whether there is evidence of a genetic basis to vulnerability to infectious disease in easz. we use results from earlier studies that have determined the degree of european taurine introgression  <cit>  and describe and analyse the causes of instances of death and illness for all the calves in the ideal project  <cit> . through analysis of these data we find associations of both heterozygosity and european taurine introgression with vulnerability to infectious disease during the first year of life in this population of easz.

RESULTS
the sample size available for analysis was  <dig> calves , of which  <dig>  died of infection-related disease within one year of birth . of the survivors, episodes of clinical illness  were reported in  <dig>  .

cut-offs for high/low heterozygosity and introgressed/non-introgressed are defined in methods.

the distributions of observed heterozygosity values for non-introgressed  and introgressed calves  are shown in figure  <dig>  the mean heterozygosity of non-introgressed calves is  <dig>   of  <dig> ). this is not an unusual level of heterozygosity for a cattle population. holstein-friesians  have been found to have average heterozygosity of  <dig>  , jersey  have an average heterozygosity of  <dig>  , n’dama  have an average heterozygosity of  <dig>   and ethiopian sheko  have an average heterozygosity of  <dig>    <cit> .

in order to test whether or not our estimates of heterozygosity are likely to reflect true genome-wide heterozygosity, we randomly sampled our snps without replacement  <dig> times and determined the degree of correlation in the heterozygosity estimates for calves based on one half of the markers and the estimates based on the other half  <cit> . we found a consistently strong correlation between the estimates . since some snps may be in linkage disequilibrium with one another, we repeated the analysis with two smaller subsets . even with this much smaller set of markers, a strong correlation between the estimates was found .

the non-introgressed calves show a skewed distribution of heterozygosity values, with the majority  contained within a near-symmetrical distribution ±  <dig>  from a mode of  <dig>  . however, there is a long tail of  <dig> calves with lower values. we categorise calves with values <  <dig>  as “low” heterozygosity, assumed to reflect a higher degree of inbreeding than the population norm. introgressed calves show a different distribution of heterozygosity values that are generally higher than those for non-introgressed calves  .

the relationship between heterozygosity and introgression is shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, there is a clear increase in heterozygosity with increasing introgression. however, in addition to the  <dig> non-introgressed calves with low heterozygosity, there are several introgressed calves with heterozygosity values that appear low relative to the amount of introgression. in order to investigate the effect of variation in heterozygosity on the fitness of introgressed calves independently of the effect of introgression we define a group of calves with low heterozygosity relative to their degree of introgression. we define this group by finding the best fit linear regression and iteratively excluding calves with heterozygosity values >  <dig>  below their expected value. this procedure results in the fitted regression line shown in figure  <dig> . using this criterion,  <dig> of the  <dig> introgressed calves are categorised as low heterozygosity. two of these  <dig> died and  <dig> others experienced at least one clinical episode .

we compared both calves that died and those that survived but experienced any episode of clinical illness to a reference category of healthy calves . we considered two categorical predictors of these outcomes, low heterozygosity and being introgressed, using a multinomial logistic regression . we used these categorical predictors, rather than analysing the estimates directly, due to the non-normality of the data  and to allow us to robustly account for the relationship between heterozygosity and introgression .

cut-offs for high/low heterozygosity and introgressed/non-introgressed are defined in methods. healthy calves were the reference category. ci = confidence interval. se = standard error. or = odds ratio. p-values in bold type are statistically significant.

we first consider the association between predictors and calf death due to infectious disease. for non-introgressed calves  only there is strong evidence of a relationship between death and low heterozygosity: odds ratio  =  <dig>  ; p <  <dig>  . for all calves, this relationship remains when both low heterozygosity and introgression are included as predictors: or =  <dig>  ; p <  <dig>  . there is no evidence of an interaction between low heterozygosity and introgression  and there is no evidence of an association between death and degree of introgression  . no significant differences were found in the nature of infectious disease-related deaths among the low heterozygosity calves. these results are robust to variation in the cut-off for introgressed calves .

clinical illness is a less well defined phenotype than death, since it includes a wide range of disease signs and it cannot be unequivocally determined whether or not an instance of clinical illness was the result of infectious disease or not . despite this, clinical illness and death are clearly related outcomes. moreover, because many more calves experienced clinical illness during their first year than died, this outcome may provide increased power to detect small effects. for non-introgressed calves there is evidence of a relationship between illness and low heterozygosity: or =  <dig>  ; p =  <dig>  . for all calves, this relationship remains when both low heterozygosity and introgression are included as predictors: or =  <dig>  ; p =  <dig>  . however, for this phenotype there is also strong evidence of an association with introgression, with introgressed calves being more likely to experience illness . again there is no evidence of any interaction between low heterozygosity and introgression . these results are robust to variation in the cut-off for introgressed calves .

discussion
our results indicate that there is a genetic basis to vulnerability to infectious disease in east african shorthorn zebu. we find a positive association between low heterozygosity and both death and illness. since we use a reasonable proxy for genome-wide heterozygosity , and the estimates of genome-wide heterozygosity are highly correlated for different subsets of snps, we consider it likely that our results are indicative of the presence of inbreeding depression in the study population, rather than being a consequence of localised associations between fitness and loci of large effect  <cit> .

our results indicate the presence of fitness-related genotypes that are either over-dominant or have recessive deleterious alleles in the population. although the proportion of calves that we classified as “low” heterozygosity was small , the effect on infectious disease-related mortality was large  and there was also an effect on clinical illness . our results give population attributable fractions  due to low heterozygosity of 14% of mortality and 4% of clinical illness  <cit> . in principle, therefore, cases of illness and deaths could be reduced by better management practices .

we found evidence that european taurine introgression affected health as it was a significant predictor of clinical illness . as there were only  <dig> deaths among those with fractional introgression greater than 2- <dig> we had very little power to detect any effect on death alone. nonetheless, our results for these two phenotypes are not inconsistent, as the confidence intervals for the odds ratios overlap . we suggest that clinical illness is a marker for vulnerability in this population and consequently that european taurine introgressed calves are more vulnerable in this sense.

we could find no non-genetic confounding factors that could be driving the observed associations between introgression and either death or illness. the introgressed calves  could not be distinguished from non-introgressed calves by the field team  <cit> ; exotic introgression was only discovered upon genetic analysis of the calves. and, although the introgressed calves were not found uniformly distributed among the  <dig> sub-locations of the study  <cit> , there is no evidence of geographic variation in the rate of mortality or of clinical illness.

since the easz ancestors of the study population have been present in east africa for many generations  <cit> , it might be expected that they may have in some way adapted to the specific challenges posed by that environment, in particular to the infectious diseases present in that region. infectious disease was the primary cause of first year mortality and illness in this population, and thus the ability to withstand infection is likely to be of significant selective advantage. on the other hand, the introgressed animals descend, in part, from european cattle, which have not had the same history of selective pressures. it has been found that european breeds are more susceptible than local breeds to some infectious diseases that are prevalent in africa, such as east coast fever  <cit> , bovine tuberculosis  <cit> , and trypanosomiasis  <cit> . thus, the european breeds are, in this important respect, less well adapted to the east african environment, and introgressed animals, while more heterozygous due to outbreeding, are also less locally adapted. while increased heterozygosity is likely to be beneficial if fitness related traits are over-dominant or there are recessive deleterious alleles in the population, the breaking up of or loss of locally adapted genotypes is likely to be detrimental to fitness. both these competing forces appear to be at work in this population of east african shorthorn zebu calves in western kenya.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, in this indigenous cattle population from the tropics we find strong associations between genome-wide heterozygosity and both death and clinical illness due to infectious diseases. there is evidence that introgression of european taurine breeds also increases vulnerability to infectious diseases. we therefore believe that we have observed the effect of both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, and have found evidence of a genetic component to vulnerability to infectious disease and of adaptation in the east african shorthorned zebu population in western kenya. this implies that the significant burden of infectious disease in this population could, in principle, be reduced by better breeding practices.
