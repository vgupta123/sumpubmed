BACKGROUND
thoroughbred horses have been selected for structural and functional variation contributing to speed and stamina during the three century development of the breed. the international federation of horseracing authorities recognizes five distance categories: sprint , mile , intermediate , long  and extended  races  and it is widely recognized among horse breeders that variation in physical and physiological characteristics are responsible for variation in individual aptitude for race distance  <cit> . although environment and training may contribute to the race distance for which a horse is best suited, the genetic contribution to the ability to perform optimally at certain distances is large; the heritability of best distance among australian racehorses has been estimated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <cit> .

a principal characteristic contributing to the ability of a thoroughbred to perform well in short distance, sprint races is the extent and maturity of the skeletal musculature. sprinters are generally shorter, stockier animals with greater muscle mass than animals suited to endurance performance, and generally mature earlier. performance aptitude for speed and stamina has also been associated with muscle fibre type phenotypes  <cit>  and metabolic adaptations to training  <cit> . variation in cardiovascular function contributing to aerobic capacity may also play a role in distinguishing individuals suited to shorter or longer distance races.

we have previously reported a sequence polymorphism  in the equine myostatin  gene strongly associated  with optimum racing distance in thoroughbred racehorses  <cit> . in several mammalian species, including cattle, sheep, dogs and horses, muscle hypertrophy phenotypes are associated with sequence variants in the mstn gene  <cit> . among horses that compete preferably in short distance  races requiring exceptional speed, the c allele is twice as common than among horses that perform optimally in longer distance  races that require more stamina . on average the optimum racing distance for c:c horses was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  f, for c:t horses was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  f and for t:t horses was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  f. furthermore, c:c horses have significantly greater muscle mass than t:t horses at two-years-old.

skeletal muscle phenotypes clearly play a role in distinguishing distance aptitude, and there is a strong effect of mstn genotype on distance  <cit> . however, heretofore, the effects of additional nuclear gene variants that may contribute to equine performance-related phenotypes have not been investigated. therefore, we performed a genome-wide snp-association study using the equinesnp <dig> bead chip genotyping array in a cohort of elite race winning thoroughbred horses. animals were separated into two distinct phenotypic cohorts comprising short distance  and middle-long distance  race winners and genetic associations were evaluated using best race distance as a quantitative phenotype. this study was designed to identify additional genetic loci as indicators of race distance aptitude and to establish whether variation at the g.66493737c>t snp was associated with inter-locus epistatic effects for race distance performance.

study animals and cohorts
a repository of registered thoroughbred horse blood or hair samples  was collected from stud farms, racing yards and sales establishments in ireland, great britain and new zealand during  <dig> to  <dig>  each sample was categorized based on retrospective racecourse performance records. only horses with performance records in flat races were included in the study. the study cohort comprised elite thoroughbreds that had won at least one group race  or a listed race--the highest standard and most valuable elite flat races are known as group  races and listed races are the next in status. only elite race winning horses were included as elite races are most likely to reflect the truest test for distance. race records were derived from three sources .

each sample was assigned a best race distance which was defined as the distance  of the highest grade of race won . when multiple races of the same grade were won, then the distance of the most valuable race, in terms of prize money, was used. a set of elite thoroughbred samples  was selected from the repository, mostly comprising samples procured in ireland and great britain ; though some had won their best race in north america. animals with excessive consanguinity  were avoided and over-representation of popular sires within the pedigrees was minimized as far as possible. one hundred and seven sires were represented in the total sample set. genomic dna was extracted from either fresh whole blood or hair samples using a modified version of a standard phenol/chloroform method  <cit>  or the maxwell  <dig> automated dna purification system . dna samples were quantified using quant-it picogreen dsdna kits  according to the manufacturer's instructions and the dna concentrations were adjusted to  <dig> ng/μl.

for the case-control investigation we compared two cohorts: samples were subdivided into short  and middle-long  distance elite race winning cohorts .

all tbs  were used for the quantitative association test analysis. racing post ratings  represent handicap ratings  that are indicative of performance ability. best race distance  was the distance  of the highest grade of race  won.

genotyping and quality control
samples were genotyped using equinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchips . this array contains approximately  <dig>  snps ascertained from the equcab <dig> snp database of the horse genome  <cit>  and has an average density of one snp per  <dig>  kb. genotyping was performed by aros applied biotechnology as, denmark. the samples that were genotyped for this study were a subset of n =  <dig> samples genotyped in two separate batches . we included four pairs of duplicate samples in batch  <dig> for qc purposes and observed greater than  <dig> % concordance in the four pairs. in total, we successfully genotyped  <dig>  loci. all samples had a genotyping rate of greater than 90%. we omitted snps which had a genotyping completion rate of less than 90%, were monomorphic or had minor allele frequencies  less than 5% in our samples from further analysis. we omitted  <dig>  snps leaving  <dig>  snps in our working build of the data and the overall genotype completion rate was  <dig> %.

statistical analyses
all statistical analyses, including tests of association were performed using plink version  <dig>   <cit> . we compared genotype frequencies in short and middle-long distance cohorts, testing for trait association using χ <dig> tests with two degrees of freedom. to test for population stratification, the pairwise identity-by-state  distance was calculated for all individuals. a permutation test was performed to investigate ibs differences among the short and middle-long distance cohorts. the linear regression model was used to evaluate quantitative trait association using best race distance  as the phenotype. we report uncorrected p-values  and p-values following correction for multiple testing using the bonferroni method . manhattan and q-q plots were generated in r using a modified version of code. the regional association plot was generated in r using a modified version of code available at http://www.broadinstitute.org.

cohort-based association  and quantitative trait association tests were also performed for the g.66493737c>t snp  <cit>  and a novel 5'utr mstn sine insertion  polymorphism identified in this study. in addition, an analysis of genome-wide epistasis was performed in which the g.66493737c>t snp was tested against all snps on the equinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip for epistatic interactions influencing best race distance. this test involved a linear regression analysis to investigate whether gene by gene interactions had a significant influence on best race distance. linkage disequilibrium  between g.66493737c>t and ins227bp and between g.66493737c>t and all chromosome  <dig> snps on the equinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip was quantified as r <dig>  a visual representation of haplotype blocks across a  <dig>  mb region on chromosome  <dig> was generated using haploview  <cit> .

re-sequencing mstn flanking sequences
pcr primers were designed to cover ~ <dig> kb of the 5'utr and ~ <dig> kb of the 3' utr of mstn genomic sequence using the pcr suite extension to the primer <dig> web-based primer design tool  <cit>  . fifteen unrelated thoroughbred dna samples  were included in a re-sequencing panel to identify novel sequence variants. bidirectional dna sequencing of pcr products was performed by macrogen inc.  using ab 3730xl sequencers . sequence variants were detected by visual examination of sequences following alignment using consed version  <dig>   <cit> .

bioinformatics
the software tool matinspector  <cit>  was used to search for transcription factor binding site consensus sequences present in  <dig> bp of the mstn 5' utr region in which a novel sine insertion  polymorphism was detected. to investigate possible microrna  regulation of mstn gene expression we screened the equine mstn gene and flanking sequences for putative mirna binding sites. a list of  <dig> predicted equine mirnas  <cit>  were inputted into the online tool diana microtest http://diana.pcbi.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/micro_t.cgi and a  <dig>  kb segment containing the equine mstn gene and ~ <dig> kb of upstream and downstream sequence was inputted as the target sequence. snpinspector  <cit>  was used to investigate transcription factor binding sites at the g.66493737c>t locus.

genotyping the chr18g.66495327ins227bp <dig>  polymorphism
a pcr-based assay for allele size discrimination was used to genotype the ins227bp polymorphism in n =  <dig> samples. the following primers were used: forward 5'-atcagctcacccttgactgtaac-3' and reverse 5'-tcatctctctggacatcgtactg-3'. alleles were determined as follows: normal allele -  <dig> bp; and insertion227bp allele -  <dig> bp.

RESULTS
genome-wide snp-association study
in a cohort-based genotype-phenotype investigation we compared two cohorts: short  and middle-long  distance elite race winners. the gwas results, sorted by chromosome, are shown in figure  <dig>  the most significant snp was on chromosome  <dig>  and five of the top ten snps were located together spanning a  <dig>  mb region on chromosome  <dig> . however, no snp in this analysis reached genome-wide significance following correction for multiple-testing.

pairwise ibs values were used to investigate population stratification between the short and middle-long cohorts. while on average phenotypically concordant pairs of individuals were more similar than phenotypically discordant pairs , the overall difference between the two groups was negligible .

using the linear regression model, we considered best race distance as a quantitative phenotype and observed the same peak of association on chromosome  <dig>  . the top eight snps encompassed a  <dig>  mb region on chromosome  <dig>  and seven reached genome-wide significance following correction for multiple testing . the most significant snp was also the most significant in the cohort-based analysis: biec2- <dig> .

candidate performance-associated genes
we investigated candidate genes in the  <dig>  mb  region on chromosome  <dig> that encompassed the seven snps that reached genome-wide significance. eleven protein coding genes were identified, including the myostatin gene  and the ngfi-a binding protein  <dig>  gene .

polymorphism detection in equine mstn flanking sequences
we previously identified snps in intron  <dig> of the equine mstn gene by re-sequencing the coding and intronic sequence  <cit> . however, genomic sequence or structural variation in the flanking regions was not investigated. therefore, for the present study we re-sequenced  <dig>  bp  of the 5' utr and  <dig>  bp  of the 3' utr of the mstn gene  and identified four novel snps in the 3' utr and a sine insertion polymorphism in the 5' utr. an overview of sequence and structural variation in the equine mstn gene and flanking sequences is provided in additional file  <dig> 

polymorphisms in the 3' utr of the mstn gene have been associated with muscle hypertrophy in sheep and are considered likely to function via creation of de novo target sites for the micrornas  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, using a set of equine mirnas  described by zhou and colleagues  <cit>  we investigated the presence of putative mirna binding sites within ~ <dig> kb upstream and downstream flanking sequences of the mstn gene. five putative mirna binding sites were identified, though none was polymorphic: i.e. no putative mirna binding site was associated with any of the eight snp alleles.

following re-sequencing in the 5' utr region of the mstn gene, we identified a  <dig> bp insertion polymorphism at chr18:66495327-- <dig> , located  <dig> bp from the start of exon  <dig> . the insertion sequence is as follows:

ggggctggccccgtggccgagtggttaagttcgtgcgctccgctgcaggcggcccagtgtttcgtcggttcgagtcctgggcgcggacatggcactg

ctcgtcggaccacgctgaggcagcgtcccacatgccacaactagaggaacccacaacgaagaatacacaactatgtaccggggggctttggggagaa

aaaggaaaataaaatctttaaaaagccacttgg.

a blast search identified the insertion sequence as a horse-specific repetitive dna sequence element  known as ere- <dig>  <cit> . also, matinspector analysis indicated that the insertion may disrupt an e-box motif.

in  <dig> of the  <dig> sequenced samples, the ins227bp allele was in concordance with the c-allele at g.66493737c>t. as complete concordance was not observed, we genotyped a set of n =  <dig> samples to determine the extent of concordance between the ins227bp and g.66493737c>t polymorphisms. we performed parallel association tests for the same set of samples to evaluate the relative performance of the two polymorphisms as predictors of optimum racing distance. the g.66493737c>t snp performed better in an association test with best race distance  than the ins227bp polymorphism . analysis of the sequence surrounding g.66493737c>t indicated that alternate alleles may result in the gain of a putative homeobox c8/hox-3alpha transcription factor binding site and/or the disruption of putative distal-less homeobox  <dig>  e2f and pdx <dig> transcription factor binding sites.

linkage disequilibrium
pairwise tests of linkage disequilibrium  were performed between g.66493737c>t and ins227bp, and between g.66493737c>t and the  <dig>  chromosome  <dig> snps represented on the genotyping array. ld was highest between g.66493737c>t and biec2- <dig> . ld between g.66493737c>t and ins227bp was r <dig> =  <dig> . seven discrete haplotype blocks were identified in the  <dig>  mb peak of association on chromosome  <dig>  the g.66493737c>t snp was included in block 3; biec2- <dig> was included in block  <dig> .

discussion
we have previously described an association between optimum racing distance and a snp  in the equine mstn gene in thoroughbred flat racehorses  <cit> . candidate gene approaches are designed considering a priori hypotheses and do not allow the opportunity for evaluation of the effect of the gene in the context of the entire genome, nor do they allow for the identification of other genes contributing to the phenotype  <cit> . therefore, employing a hypothesis-free approach we investigated genome-wide influences on optimum racing distance by conducting a genome-wide snp-association study in a cohort of elite thoroughbred racehorses.

the genomic region on chromosome  <dig> containing the mstn gene was the highest ranked region in the gwas for best racing distance, reaching genome-wide significance for a set of seven snps within a  <dig>  mb region. the best snp  and the second best snp  were  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb from the mstn gene, respectively. we searched the region for other plausible candidate genes and identified the ngfi-a binding protein  <dig>  gene  located ~ <dig> kb from biec2- <dig>  the product of the nab <dig> gene is highly expressed in cardiac muscle and has been reported to be a transcriptional regulator of cardiac growth  <cit> . its principal role is in its interaction with the early growth response  <dig>  transcriptional activator that is involved in regulation of cellular growth and differentiation  <cit> .

we considered nab <dig> as a strong candidate gene to influence an athletic performance phenotype as we have previously identified egr- <dig> mrna transcript alterations  in skeletal muscle immediately following a bout of treadmill exercise in untrained thoroughbred horses  <cit> . twelve snps located within the nab <dig> genomic sequence  are documented in the equcab <dig> snp database, and three are contained on the equinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip. after correction for multiple testing, there were no detectable associations between the three nab <dig> snps and the trait . therefore, we did not further consider nab <dig> as a potential major contributor to variation in optimum racing distance.

results from analyses of gene expression generated since our initial report of an association between mstn genomic variation and optimum racing distance in thoroughbreds support the hypothesis that the mstn gene is functionally relevant to racing performance variation. in a transcriptome-wide investigation using digital gene expression  technology, we identified the greatest alteration in mrna abundance in transcripts from mstn in thoroughbred skeletal muscle following a ten-month period of exercise training. seventy-four annotated transcripts were differentially expressed between pre-and post-training states and among the  <dig> genes with decreased expression, mstn mrna transcripts were the most significantly reduced   <cit> .

consequently, we focused on comprehensively evaluating variation in the mstn gene by re-sequencing ~ <dig> kb of the 3' and 5' flanking sequences. four novel 3' utr snps and a  <dig> bp sine insertion  polymorphism located  <dig> bp upstream of the coding region start site were identified. we investigated whether the 3' utr snps may abrogate existing or create de novo putative mirna binding sites, as has been described for mstn influenced phenotypic variation in texel sheep  <cit> . however, there was no evidence for alterations in putative mirna binding sites. next, because of the close proximity to the transcriptional start site, we considered the ins227bp polymorphism as a strong functional candidate contributing to variation in racing performance. however, a comparative evaluation of association using the same set of samples  demonstrated that the g.66493737c>t snp displayed a stronger association  with best race distance than the ins227bp polymorphism .

an evaluation of ld showed that the strongest association was between g.66493737c>t and the most significant snp in the present study, biec2- <dig>  a comparison of trait association in the same set of samples  confirmed the superior power of the g.66493737c>t snp  in the prediction of best race distance when compared with biec2- <dig> . the significance values and genotype frequencies for the top snps in the gwas and the g.66493737c>t snp are shown in table  <dig>  in addition, we investigated whether g.66493737c>t may interact with other snps represented on the equinesnp <dig> genotyping array; however, no significant interaction was observed to influence best race distance . therefore, the effect of genotype on racing phenotype is highly likely a result of the previously reported variation in the mstn gene at locus g.66493737c>t.

a11: genotype frequency for homozygotes  in the population ; a12: genotype frequency for heterozygotes; a <dig> genotype frequency for homozygotes . correction for multiple testing was not applied for g.66493737c>t; however, the association remains stronger  after application of a correction factor.

it is important to note that the sample size used for the present study is relatively small. however, the results of the quantitative trait gwas demonstrate that the sample size used was sufficient to detect a major genetic effect such as that manifested at the mstn locus. a lower sample size requirement for gwas in the thoroughbred is supported by population genomics analyses of this population in comparison to other horse breeds. these demonstrate that the extent of ld in the thoroughbred is significantly greater than that measured in other horse populations, being comparable to ld estimates in inbred dog breeds  <cit> .the high ld in thoroughbreds is a reflection of low effective population size, which enables detection of associations with smaller sample sizes.

the mechanism by which the g.66493737c>t sequence variant may affect the muscle phenotype in horses is not clear; however we propose a direct effect of the snp on the control of myocyte development. myostatin is a growth and differentiation factor  that functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass development and results in hypertrophied muscle phenotypes in a range of mammalian species, including horse. consistent with this role myostatin has been shown to repress the proliferation and differentiation of cultured myocytes  <cit> . the proliferation of myoblasts is determined by the control and progression of the cell cycle, a role which has been assigned to members of the e2f family of transcription factors  <cit> . the g.66493737c>t snp is located within the sequence of a putative e2f transcription factor binding site in intron  <dig> of the mstn gene. it may therefore be plausible to propose a mechanism by which allele-specific binding of e2f to myostatin influences the growth and development of myocytes following signalling from upstream effector proteins such as retinoblastoma protein  <cit> . genotype-specific gene expression studies will shed light on the allele-specific effect on function.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first genome-wide investigation of sequence variant association with an athletic performance phenotype in thoroughbred racehorses. it complements a recent dge transcriptome-wide investigation of functional responses to exercise training in thoroughbred skeletal muscle, which identified mstn mrna transcripts as the most significantly altered following a ten month period of training. the present study provides clear evidence that the previously reported polymorphism in equine mstn at locus g.66493737c>t is the most powerful genome-wide predictor of optimum racing distance in thoroughbred horses.
