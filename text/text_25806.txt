BACKGROUND
protection against ischemic lesion has been very extensively studied in the heart and brain. one powerful endogenous mechanism of protection present in these and other organs is ischemic preconditioning. this consists of a single or a series of brief, non-lethal ischemic periods which condition the tissue to resist against significant cell death when subsequently challenged by a normally lethal ischemia. delayed protection, which is the subject of the present study, takes place from  <dig> h to  <dig> days after the preconditioning ischemia  <cit> , and must involve transcriptional regulation.

ischemia of cardiac cells or neurons leads to apoptosis which occurs via release of cytochrome c from mitochondria  <cit> . this activates the caspase cascade. these events are triggered in large part by excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species   <cit> .

in the heart, as in the brain, ischemic tolerance induced by preconditioning is associated with modest uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain  <cit> , which reduces the production of ros by respiration. a variety of signalling pathways seems to be involved. one of the mitochondrial elements believed to play a role in such preconditioning are the uncoupling proteins ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  there is clear evidence of increased expression of ucp2/ <dig> in the heart in this situation  <cit> , and more limited evidence in the brain for ucp <dig>  <cit>  . in the brain, it has been shown that new protein expression can be triggered by large-scale mitochondrial ros production occurring at reperfusion  <cit> .

with respect to the brain, the uncoupling protein, ucp- <dig>  has been recently noted to possess a certain neuroprotective activity  <cit> . situated in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it is distributed in several brain regions  <cit> . its role appears to be to dissipate the proton electrochemical gradient through the mitochondrial inner membrane  <cit> . by this means, it mildly uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from respiration, decreases the inner membrane potential, and reduces ros production, especially superoxide, by the respiratory complexes  <cit> . thus, increased expression of this protein coincident with ischemia should reduce the production of ros in mitochondria and confer protection on cells subject to i/r. compatible effects of ucp <dig> have indeed been demonstrated in in vitro preparations  <cit> , but only the study by mattiasson et al  <cit>  has so far provided in vivo data, in the form of measures of ucp <dig> mrna, compatible with this possibility in ischemic preconditioning. increased protein expression has not yet been demonstrated.

the peptide ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue  receptor   <cit> . although its role in the control of feeding and energy metabolism is well known, it also exerts protective effects against i/r injury in the cardiovascular system  <cit>  and the gastro-intestinal system  <cit> . an inhibitory influence on apoptosis has been reported  <cit> .

we recently reported for the first time that post-ischemic ghrelin administration was protective and anti-apoptotic in the brain, in rat hippocampus, after global forebrain i/r  <cit> . subsequently, it has been shown that ghrelin-induced neuroprotection in vitro  was associated with inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway , and increased bcl2/bax ratio  <cit> . these phenomena are associated with reduced i/r injury to the hippocampal ca <dig> neurons after ipc  <cit> . another recent study has confirmed that redox injury and apoptotic mechanisms could be inhibited by ghrelin in cortical neurons subject to i/r  <cit> .

thus, although apparently different in their modes of triggering protection, ipc and ghrelin exert similar strong protection in the brain, including the hippocampus. both are also capable of protecting other organs such as heart and intestine.

concerning ghrelin, chung et al  <cit>  also showed that this protection was associated with mitochondrial membrane potential stabilization and decreased ros formation, compatible with increased activity of ucp <dig>  this suggests, therefore, that neuroprotection by either ghrelin or ipc could involve inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through increased expression of ucp <dig>  indeed, it has been shown in different tissues that ghrelin can induce upregulation of ucp <dig> and sometimes ucp <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, a recent study in the heart showed that although ipc can involve different signalling pathways, these converge finally at the mitochondrial respiratory pathway  <cit> .

the experiments undertaken in this study sought to confirm that ucp <dig> protein was effectively over-expressed in vivo in ischemically preconditioned hippocampus, and to determine if the production of ros could be responsible for this increased expression. second, by similar measurements of ucp <dig> mrna, we determined whether ipc and ghrelin administration involved similar changes in ucp <dig> protein transcription when used to attenuate hippocampal ischemic lesion. our results confirm the increased ucp <dig> expression and reveal a striking resemblance in the final action of ghrelin and ipc.

RESULTS
ucp <dig> protein expression in hippocampal neurons after ipc
 <dig>  ischemic preconditioning protects ca <dig> neurons. the protection afforded by ipc to the ca <dig> area of the hippocampus was assessed with anti-neun staining. neun is a specific, neuronal protein. typical images from brains of the four groups are shown in fig  <dig>  the i/r group  showed a majority of neurons with much reduced, irregular staining, compared to the three other groups, which appeared very similar. thus, the preconditioning stimulus did not itself cause a significant reduction in normal neurons. blinded counting of intact neurons gave the result shown in fig 1e, indicating a high degree of neuronal protection in the ipc+i/r group.

 <dig>  ucp <dig> protein immunoreactivity is increased in ca <dig> neurons after ischemic preconditioning. the variation of ucp <dig> protein expression in ca <dig> pyramidal neurons was examined by ihc. two anti-ucp <dig> antibodies were tested in the hippocampi of the four groups. typical results are shown in fig  <dig>  obtained with a c-terminal antibody . the general pattern of results found in each series was very similar, showing very weak staining in the controls , slightly brighter staining in the i/r  and i/r+ipc  groups, and much stronger staining in the ipc group . since the sc <dig> antibody gave stronger staining, we used it for the statistical comparison of the fluorescence intensity in the four groups. absence of staining was found when this antibody was omitted . the graph  shows that the intensity in the ipc group considerably exceeded that of the other three groups. the fluorescence intensities of the i/r and ipc+i/r groups were numerically higher than, but not significantly different from, those from control. this evaluation comprised a correction for the differences in background fluorescence .

 <dig>  further control experiments. since doubts about the specificity and sensitivity of certain anti-ucp <dig> antibodies have been expressed  <cit> , we performed other control experiments and examined the staining in detail. the n-terminal antibody sc  <dig> was tested under identical conditions to sc <dig> and found to stain the four types of hippocampal sections with an exactly similar pattern . in stomach tissue from two control rats and three rats which fasted for  <dig> h, we found ucp <dig> immunoreactivity in 5- <dig> times more cells in the fasting animals  than in controls . fasting has previously been shown to increase the ucp <dig> protein detected by western blot in the stomach of mice  <cit> . fig 3c is an enlargement of one cell positive for ucp <dig> immunoreactivity. it reveals a close relation of ucp <dig> immunoreactivity and dapi staining .

whereas ucp <dig> staining in the control situation was weak and limited to a perinuclear halo , in some cases in the ipc group it was observed to invade the proximal part of the pyramidal cell dendrites , as previously noted  <cit> . in the ipc-treated brains, in which the the ucp <dig> immunoreactivity was always far denser, the staining pervaded a large part of the cytoplasm and often appeared intimately related to the dapi staining of dna in the nucleus , the shape of which became less regular . outside the pyramidal cell layer, small dapi-stained nuclei of presumed glial cells were not associated with ucp <dig> staining . in the cytoplasm of pyramidal neurons, a modest degree of overlap with neun immunoreactivity was noted .

 <dig>  increase in ucp <dig> immunoreactivity in ipc brains is blocked by ros scavenging. in three groups of rats undergoing ipc treatment, one group received no treatment, one received intraperitoneal sod and one received only vehicle. as shown in fig 4a, b, c, d, the brains from the sod-treated rats showed a dramatic reduction in the ucp <dig> immunoreactivity detected at day  <dig>  indeed, even the morphological aspect of the remaining ucp <dig> immunoreactivity  resembled that seen in the non-ischemic animals .

 <dig>  the level of ucp <dig> immunoreactivity fades considerably between  <dig> and  <dig> days after ipc. when groups of rats subjected to ipc were sacrificed at day  <dig>  the ucp <dig> immunoreactivity had decreased significantly to a low level compared to the high level observed at day  <dig> . thus, a high level of expression of ucp <dig> was seen at day  <dig>  whereas, although numerically higher, the fluorescence intensity at day  <dig> was not significantly different from the control .

comparison of ucp <dig> mrna in ipc- and ghrelin-treated hippocampi
 <dig>  ischemic preconditioning increases the amount of hippocampal ucp <dig> mrna. in a set of parallel experiments, hippocampi from the same four groups as in the ihc experiments were compared by rt-pcr to compare the amounts of ucp <dig> mrna present . fig 6a illustrates a typical gel, the overall results being shown in fig 6b. mrna was increased considerably in the ipc group, but only moderately  in the i/r and ipc+i/r groups, compared to control. the two intermediate groups were also significantly different from the ipc group. this result suggests that a high level of transcription of mrna was induced in the hippocampus by the ipc treatment. however, in the ipc+i/r group, at the time of the sacrifice  <dig> days after ipc, the level had fallen back to the level of the i/r group.

 <dig>  ghrelin treatment is accompanied by increased amounts of hippocampal ucp <dig> mrna. fig  <dig> shows that the i/r group treated with ghrelin on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained significantly increased amounts of ucp <dig> mrna in the hippocampus on day  <dig>  indicating that increased ucp <dig> transcription was associated with the protection of hippocampal neurons. this result is to be set against our previous results on ghrelin-induced protection: intraperitoneal ghrelin on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> afforded a strong protection of the ca <dig> neurons against our standard ischemia, as measured by cell counting in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections  <cit> .

discussion
only one previous publication has shown evidence of increased expression of brain ucp <dig>  measured as mrna by in situ hybridization, after preconditioning ischemia in vivo  <cit> . we have shown in vivo changes in ucp <dig> mrna in parallel with changes in ucp <dig> protein expression in the i/r, ipc+i/r and ipc groups compared with control. compatible in vitro effects  on ucp <dig> expression have been found by diano et al  <cit> , and mattiasson et al  <cit> . our results concerning a global forebrain ischemia model provide more complete in vivo data on ucp <dig> protein expression by immunohistochemistry, confirm and extend the mrna measurements, extend the data on temporal aspects of ucp <dig> expression, and demonstrate its dependence on ros production.

furthermore, our experiments on mrna establish for the first time a similar relationship between two dissimilar strategies, ipc or ghrelin treatment, which protect against i/r lesion, and upregulation of a mitochondrial ion transporter protein, ucp <dig> 

ipc-induced neuroprotection and ucp2
previous studies have clearly shown the neuronal death induced in the hippocampal ca <dig> area by global forebrain ischemia, and the protection afforded by ipc  <cit> . similar findings in the heart concern cardiocytes  <cit> . we confirm these results and further show that the preconditioning ischemia does not alone cause significant neuronal damage . in parallel, ucp <dig> mrna  and protein expression  both show strong upregulation of ucp <dig> after the same preconditioning ischemia . several points need discussion.

first, one point of the overall paradigm that had to be optimized by compromise was the question of how long the reperfusion times should be. barone et al  <cit>  showed the preconditioning phenomenon to last 1- <dig> days and to require new protein formation before the lethal ischemia. puisieux et al  <cit>  confirmed a window of protection of at least 24- <dig> h with new protein formation. schmidt-kastner et al  <cit>  studied the ca <dig> damage after a single long ischemia, and determined maximal ca <dig> damage at 48- <dig> h. thus, we chose the delay of  <dig> days after ipc  or after lethal ischemia  because  it is sufficient to allow important formation of new protein between the preconditioning and the lethal ischemia,  it is within the range of efficacy of preconditioning, and  it is sufficient to allow evaluation of neuronal lesion after i/r.

second, because of previous reports on ucp <dig> antibody problems  with one raised against an n-terminal peptide . the general pattern of expression in the four groups was practically identical. it is difficult to conceive how two different molecules with appropriate peptide sequences  could behave in an apparently identical manner as observed by the two antibodies. however, this does not completely exclude the possibility that the one we used for quantification could bind to additional proteins. we tested it in the stomach and the clear-cut labelling of specific mucosal cells was multiplied several fold in fasting compared to control animals, exactly corresponding to the results of the western blot analysis of pecqueur et al  <cit> . this increased expression of ucp <dig> could be linked to the upregulation of ghrelin in the stomach in fasting animals. we also checked the experiment with negative controls, i.e. absence of primary antibody . other workers have considered these two antibodies to be specific to ucp <dig>  <cit> , and krauss et al  <cit>  showed sc <dig> to be unable to stain ucp <dig> knock-out mice.

third, although the two measures of ucp <dig> upregulation gave parallel results , the relative intergroup differences in values of mrna/protein expression seem paradoxical, since the ipc+i/r group values are only modestly increased. the hypothesis we envisaged is that ucp <dig>  which is known to reduce mitochondrial ros production  <cit> , would protect the neurons from a lethal ischemia if over-expressed during the appropriate period. this should be during the lethal ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion period. our evidence is indeed that ucp <dig> upregulation was considerable at day  <dig> after a preconditioning ischemia, at the moment of induction of the lethal ischemia, as shown by both immunohistochemistry of ucp <dig> protein in the ca <dig> neurons and rt-pcr of ucp <dig> in the hippocampus. in contrast, at day  <dig> after a preconditioning ischemia alone  , the ucp <dig> immunoreactivity had returned near to baseline. thus, the time-course of expression after preconditioning is appropriately high at day  <dig> to protect the neurons during the phase of high ros production, but at day  <dig> ucp <dig> over-expression is probably much reduced, which is compatible with the known duration of ischemic preconditioning  <cit> . in the case of preconditioned animals undergoing a second, lethal ischemia , this lethal  ischemia presumably could not induce a large, durable surge of ucp <dig> synthesis, probably because the longer duration of ischemia induces a different pattern of response, which reduces protein synthesis  <cit> . such was the case in the experiments of chen et al  <cit> , in which a 10-min lethal ischemia moderately and increasingly induced ucp <dig> protein expression  from  <dig> to  <dig> h, after which it began to decline . in the experiments of mattiasson et al  <cit> , a significantly increased level of ucp <dig> mrna was found in vivo at  <dig> h after a 3-min ischemia. a more detailed study of the time-course of ischemia-induced ucp <dig> upregulation is required to formulate a more precise hypothesis.

fourth, there is important evidence that excess ros production can induce ucp <dig> over-expression and activation  <cit> . such a large-scale production of ros occurs during ischemia, especially at reperfusion. when mori et al  <cit>  injected sod at the time of a preconditioning ischemia , they observed strong attenuation of the protection against the subsequent lethal ischemia. we thus tested the hypothesis that ucp <dig> expression would not be upregulated if ros were scavenged at the appropriate time, i.e. beginning at the time of the preconditioning ischemia. this experiment on the expression of ucp <dig> protein in ipc animals treated with sod clearly confirmed that most of this increased expression is abolished. moreover, this abolition of the increase in ucp <dig> immunoreactivity was associated with the reversion of the immunohistochemical image to the control pattern , in which ucp <dig> labelling was limited to a weak perinuclear halo .

although sod is a large molecule, its passage across the blood-brain barrier is facilitated by the ischemia itself which has been shown to alter the permeability of the microvessels  <cit> . furthermore, systemic injection of sod was used previously to prevent ros production following global forebrain ischemia  <cit> , a protocol which efficiently reduced ischemic damage. our observations are strong evidence of the association of ucp <dig> over-expression with excess ros production by the preconditioning ischemia. in contrast, it has been reported that a preconditioning ischemia does not induce upregulation of sod, whether mnsod or cu-znsod  <cit> . overall, the present data are extremely coherent with an involvement of upregulated ucp <dig> in the ipc-induced protection of the ca <dig> area .

comparison of ghrelin- and ipc-induced effects on ucp <dig> mrna in hippocampus
mrna coding for receptors to ghrelin  have been found in brain, especially the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the anterior pituitary  <cit> . both forms of ghrelin, acylated  and unacylated, are known to cross the blood-brain barrier  <cit> . it seems established that only acylated ghrelin can bind to ghs receptors and release gh  <cit> , but there may also be a direct, non-growth hormone  releasing type of activity  <cit> , presumably by another type of receptor. we administered the acylated form, but it is highly probable that plasmatic enzymes de-esterify the ser-octanoyl form and vice versa  <cit> , so that we cannot distinguish which form is active here.

neuroprotection by ghrelin was demonstrated by liu et al  <cit>  in this 4-vessel occlusion model , and by chung et al  <cit>  in a focal ischemia model. both groups found inhibition of apoptosis in the hippocampus, and the latter group reported evidence of inhibition of the mitochondrial pathway . ghrelin has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in other models  <cit> . these anti-apoptosis mechanisms have also been demonstrated in ipc-induced neuroprotection  <cit> . it is probable therefore that anti-apoptosis mechanisms comprise a significant common pathway for neuroprotection by these two strategies. furthermore, ghrelin has been shown to reduce oxidative stress in a rat seizure model  <cit> , to reduce oxidative stress in the stomach after ischemia and to inhibit ros generation in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes  <cit> , and to inhibit ros generation in hyperglycemic endothelial cells  <cit> . in the brain, it has recently been shown that the action of ghrelin on arcuate nucleus neurons is driven by a fatty acid oxidation pathway involving ampk, cpt <dig> and free radicals that are scavenged by ucp <dig>  <cit> . moreover, in other models, ghrelin administration has been shown to induce upregulation of ucp <dig> and ucp <dig>  in white adipose tissue  <cit>  and liver  <cit> , and gh increases ucp <dig> mrna in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle  <cit> . such considerations led us to determine whether ghrelin administration and ipc induce similar upregulation of ucp <dig> mrna in the hippocampus in a global i/r model.

in the ghrelin experiments, moderate upregulation of hippocampal ucp <dig> mrna was seen  in the i/r group, similar to that found in the i/r group of the ipc series in fig  <dig>  and a much larger upregulation in the i/r+ghrelin group. we followed our previous protocol of  <dig> post-ischemic administrations at  <dig> h intervals which induced strong neuroprotection  <cit> . it is likely that this protocol led to a more persistent upregulation of ucp <dig> than would have been induced by a single injection of ghrelin or a single preconditioning ischemia.

CONCLUSIONS
these coherent data on ghrelin- and ipc-induced protection afford support for the hypothesis that ucp <dig> upregulation may often be implicated in different types of neuroprotection, and perhaps in the protection of other organs, although the present two strategies of neuroprotection clearly have a different time-course of action. the possible involvement of ucp <dig> in ghrelin-induced protection against ischemic lesion has not been previously explored. our results add several in vivo lines of evidence connecting it to ipc protection. although we did not establish functional data on ucp <dig> involvement in protection, our data encourage further study of the temporal aspects of its in vivo expression, together with an evaluation of its expression in other models of cerebral ischemia.
