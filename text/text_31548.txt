BACKGROUND
the chromatin state and transcription level of a chromosomal region has been found to be related to modifications of histones  <cit>  as well as dna  <cit> . the fundamental structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is formed by wrapping dna around a histone octamer consisting of two copies each of four core histone proteins . the tails of these histones can be modified in a variety of ways that relate to chromatin condensation and gene expression <cit> . different histone residues can be methylated, acetylated, phosphorylated or ubiquitinated to either directly change the chromatin structure or allow for the binding of specific transcription factors  <cit> .

the acetylation and methylation states of various lysine residues have been extensively investigated. due to the reactive nature of the amine group on the side chain of lysine, it can be acetylated or mono-, di- or tri- methylated. enrichment for acetylated histones has been found to correlate with euchromatic and gene-coding regions  <cit> . in contrast, certain methylations are associated with activation and others with repression. the most extensively characterized activating methylation is h3k <dig> <cit> , while the h3k <dig>  <cit>  and h3k <dig>  <cit>  methylations are thought to lead to repression and inactivation. recently, though, mono-methylations of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> have been found to be enriched in active genes  <cit> .

using antibodies with specificity for a particular methylation state, cells have been profiled separately for mono-, di-, and tri- methylation of the same residue. these comparisons were originally performed using mass-spectroscopy and comparisons of staining patterns <cit> . since these studies relied on comparisons of staining patterns, they were only able to produce low-resolution results that could not be linked to sequence positions. more recently, the chip-chip  <cit>  and chip-seq  <cit>  techniques have been utilized for high-resolution sequence level profiling of histone modifications in mammalian genomes <cit> . these techniques utilize chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with either tiling microarray hybridization or high-throughput sequencing to determine the genomic locations of a particular modification. it is now possible to obtain resolution on the level of individual nucleosomes. because histone modifications act on individual nucleosome and there may be modification differences between adjacent nucleosomes, this level of resolution is highly informative.

the most comprehensive profiling of histone modifications has been performed in cd4+ t cells <cit> . the genome-wide locations at a single nucleosome level resolution of  <dig> different histone methylations and acetylations were profiled, including different levels of methylation of the same residue. in these studies, the modification profiles surrounding the promoters of genes with different levels of expression were examined. basic comparisons between the different modifications were performed in the region surrounding annotated genes, but here we are reporting the results of an extension of our initial studies  <cit>  to non-genic regions of the human genome.

in particular, we wanted to investigate histone modifications in three important largely non-coding regions of the genome: pericentromeres, subtelomeres, and gene deserts. these regions are mostly non-coding, but little work has been performed to characterize and differentiate them with regard to histone modifications. using the identified genome-wide locations for histone methylations and acetylations in cd4+ t cells, we have identified the modifications that are strongly enriched in pericentromeres, subtelomeres, and intergenic regions . we have also used consensus repeat sequences to analyze histone modifications present in the unassembled portions of telomeres and centromeres.

RESULTS
characterization of histone modifications enriched in pericentromeres, subtelomeres or gene deserts
to characterize the histone modifications that are enriched in different regions of the genome, we first obtained the locations of each type of region. our determinations were made based upon gene annotations . pericentromeres were defined for each chromosome as the region between the two genes most proximal to the centromeric gap in the genome assembly. from this region, the  <dig> kb nearest to each of the genes was removed since it could contain regulatory elements for the genes. subtelomeres designations from  <cit>  were used as a starting point. if a gene was found in a subtelomere, the gene was removed along with the  <dig> kb surrounding it on each side. gene deserts were defined as regions of greater than  <dig> mb between two adjacent genes, with the  <dig> kb proximal to each gene removed. from all three types of regions, any known pol ii binding sites <cit>  or dnase i hypersensitive sites  <cit>  with  <dig> bp flanking regions were removed in order to exclude regions that may be related to the adjacent genes.

in each of these genomic regions, we determined the statistically significant histone modifications. first, the average number of tags for each modification in each type of region was determined. random samples of the genome having the same size as each type of region were then taken and the number of tags for each modification was determined for the samples. by comparing the actual count to the counts in the random samples, an empirical p-value for significance could be determined . the results of this analysis are shown in table  <dig>  all of the modifications shown are significant with a q-value <  <dig> , with the full data listed in additional file  <dig>

the results for pericentromeres are intriguing. the enrichment of h3k9me <dig> is expected, as it is a known mark for constitutive heterochromatin. h4k20me <dig> is a known mark of repressed chromatin and therefore it would be expected to be enriched in non-genic regions of the genome. surprisingly, it is only found strongly in pericentromeres and in no other type of non-genic region. the appearances of h4r3me <dig> and h3r2me <dig> as significant modifications in pericentromeres are likewise interesting. methylation of h4r <dig> has been generally correlated with expression and active chromatin  <cit> . but, as with other histone modifications, no distinction has been made between the two methylation states of h4r <dig>  h4r3me <dig> and h4r3me <dig>  therefore, h4r3me <dig> could be a signal of pericentromeres while h4r3me <dig> could be a signal of active genes. this is supported by the fact that h4r2me <dig> levels were not found to have a preferential enrichment at either active or silent promoters  <cit> . h3r2me <dig> has been found to impede the binding of effector proteins to h3k4me <dig> and thus to control gene expression  <cit> . it is possible that the significant levels of h3r2me <dig> in pericentromeres are important in preventing the expression of genes in those loci. these four modifications are all strongly correlated with each other within pericentromeric regions indicating that they are likely to be found on the same nucleosomes.

for gene deserts, the di- and tri methylations of h3k9me <dig> were found to be significantly enriched, as would be expected  <cit> . distinctly lacking, were h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  this absence could be due to the presence of h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> in silent and active genes . for subtelomeres, the repressive marks h3k27me2/ <dig> were found to be enriched along with two acetylations that are marks of activation, h2ak5ac and h3k14ac.

h4k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation levels are varied in pericentromeres, subtelomeres and gene deserts
to further characterize the histone modifications in different non-genic regions, we compared the multiple methylation states of individual residues in each region. the number of tags identified for each methylation state of h4k <dig> and h3k <dig> in pericentromeres, subtelomeres and gene deserts were counted and the results are shown in figure  <dig>  for h4k20me, the differences between the types of chromatin are significant. in each region, levels of h4k20me <dig> are minimal and invariant. one possible reason for this is that h4k20me <dig> is a marker of active genes  <cit>  and it is depleted in constitutive heterochromatin. the reverse is found for h4k20me <dig> which has been found to associate with constitutive heterochromatin  <cit> . in pericentromeres, the level of h4k20me <dig> is over  <dig> times the level of h4k20me <dig>  this difference decreases in gene deserts and it is lowest in subtelomeres where the level of h4k20me <dig> is only double the level of h4k20me <dig>  this indicates that h4k20me <dig> may be important for pericentromeres.

we next compared the three levels of methylation of h3k <dig> . the levels of h3k9me2/ <dig> have been found to be enriched in non-genic regions, while h3k9me <dig> levels are enriched at active genes  <cit> . we found that for each type of non-genic region the order of enrichment levels is the same with h3k9me3> h3k9me2>h3k9me <dig>  while the order is the same, the ratio between the methylation levels varies. in pericentromeres, the levels of h3k9me <dig> are almost double those of h3k9me <dig>  this difference is greatly decreased in subtelomeres where the levels are similar and within one standard error of the mean . in pericentromeres, the combined levels of h3k9me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> are  <dig> times those of h3k9me <dig>  this is reduced to  <dig> times the level of h3k9me <dig> in subtelomeres.

analysis of histone modifications at centromeric and telomeric repeats
since large regions of the centromeres and telomeres of the human genome are not included in the genome assembly, they could not be accurately probed by our techniques. to probe these regions, we have used a technique similar to that previously used for studying histone modifications at repetitive regions in the mouse genome  <cit> . as a proxy for the actual genome sequences at repetitive locations, consensus repeat sequences are used. we have taken all of the reads for each methylation and determined the percentage of them that aligned either to telomere or centromere consensus repeat sequences. since the percentages of repeats were calculated and compared, no normalization for differences in antibody specificity or number of sequenced tags were required. the percentage is a self-normalizing calculation. 

for centromeres, the most represented modifications are h4k20me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> and the least significant modifications are h3k4me <dig> and h4k20me <dig>  both h4k20me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> are known to be associated with constitutive heterochromatin <cit>  and were also found to be significantly enriched in pericentromeres. this indicates that centromeres have heterochromatic characteristics and may require these histone modifications to prevent expression. for telomeres, the most significant modifications are h2bk5me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> and the least significant are h3k36me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  the finding of these two activating modifications to be the strongest in telomeres is interesting and is likely to be related to the recent finding of rna polymerase ii transcription at mouse <cit>  and human <cit>  telomeres. the lack of h3k9me <dig> also indicates that telomeres are not consistent with other non-coding regions of the human genome. in contrast to the middle of a chromosome where pericentromeres and centromeres have similar enriched histone modifications, the ends of chromosomes at subtelomeres and telomeres have different modifications. we also found that a much larger percentage of the tags matched the centromeric repeats than the telomeric repeats. the percentage of tags matching the centromeric repeats range from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, while the range for telomeric repeats is from 10e-4% to 10e- <dig> %. this can be explained by the much larger percentage of the genome contained in centromeres than in telomeres  <cit> . because the percentage of reads was compared rather than the raw numbers of reads, this result should not be affected by differences in sequencing depth.

determination of modifications with statistically significant enrichment in different regions of the genome
we next decided to compare our findings for non-genic regions to the genic portions of the genome. using comparisons to random samples of the genome , we determined the histone modifications statistically significant in silent genes, medium expression genes, high expression genes, and a combined set of all genes without regard to expression. the complete list of significant modifications is summarized in table  <dig>  all modifications listed in this table are significant at a q-value of  <dig>  and a complete list of all modifications with their mean counts and empirical p-values and q-values are in additional file  <dig>  when all of the genic regions without regard to expression were tested, all of the acetylations and some of the methylations were found to be significant. interestingly, when the genes were divided into groups by expression level, different modifications were found to be significant for each level of expression. the least well-characterized groups are silent genes and non-genic regions which each only have a few modifications significantly enriched. in contrast, there are many modifications that are preferentially associated with active genes.

h3k9me2/ <dig> and h3k9me <dig> have variant levels of enrichment in non-genic regions and in genes
since the significance analysis found h3k9me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> to be enriched in non-genic regions and h3k9me <dig> enriched at active genes, we wanted to further investigate the relationship between h3k <dig> methylation state and expression level. in general, h3k <dig> methylation has been considered to be an indicator of inactive and silent chromatin <cit> , but increased levels of h3k9me <dig> are found consistently in the gene body of active genes  <cit> . interestingly, certain active genes have also been found to have h3k9me <dig> <cit> .

to investigate the roles of mono-, di- and tri-methylated h3k <dig>  we compared the levels of enrichment of each modification in overall non-genic regions in addition to genes with different levels of activity . it was found that the overall profiles for h3k9me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> are highly similar . the enrichment for these two modifications was highest in non-genic silent regions and decreased as the activity of the regions increased. in contrast, a completely opposite profile was found for h3k9me <dig>  as the activity level for genomic regions increased, the level of h3k9me <dig> increased greatly. these findings indicate that h3k9me is not a monolithic modification and h3k9me <dig> is distinct from h3k9me2/ <dig> 

the three levels of h3k <dig> methylation are all activating marks, but h3k4me <dig> is the least enriched in active genes relative to inactive genes
h3k4me has long been considered an activating mark for chromatin, but differences between h3k4me2/ <dig> and h3k4me <dig> have been found <cit> . to compare the enrichments of h3k4me <dig>  h4k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> in broader regions, we compared the counts of each modification in regions of the genome . this figure suggests that the enrichment patterns for h3k4me <dig>  me <dig>  and me <dig> are almost congruent  with each other indicating that all three levels of methylation of h3k <dig> are equally important determinants of expression level as activating marks. the only regions of the genome having a significant difference between the modifications of h3k <dig> are highly expressed genes. in these regions h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> are enriched at higher levels than h3k4me3

the methylation states of h3k <dig> each have a distinct profile
different methylation states of h3k <dig> are found to be significant in distinct parts of the genome . because of this variation, we wanted to determine how the different modification states are related to genes with different levels of expression. we determined the number of counts for each methylation state of h3k27me <dig> in each type of region in the genome. the resulting plots are shown in figure  <dig> 

it was found that the levels of h3k27me <dig> are most enriched at silent genes. the levels of this modification is similarly minimal in both non-genic regions and active genes. rather than having an enrichment level that is either correlated or anti-correlated with expression, it has a parabolic profile with the peak in silent genes. this finding is especially interesting when considered in concert with the profiles of the other levels of methylation of h3k <dig> and their presumed functions. each level of methylation of these two residues has a completely distinct profile. this diversity is much greater than what was found for any other histone residues including h3k <dig>  h4k <dig> and h4k <dig> 

discussion
we have analyzed histone modification patterns in pericentromeres, subtelomeres, and gene deserts. it was found that each region has a distinct histone modification profile even though they are all traditionally considered to be constitutive heterochromatin or heterochromatin-like  <cit> . this is not unexpected since each of them has a distinct function. pericentromeres are involved in the cohesion of sister chromatids during cell division  <cit> , subtelomeres maintain chromosome stability  <cit>  and gene deserts do not have a well defined function but they may contain long-range regulators of gene function  <cit>  or structural regions such as the nuclear matrix attachment sites  <cit> . each of these functions is performed by a specific set of dna binding proteins and thus should be associated with distinct histone modifications. one possibility for the discrepancy between h3k9me <dig> levels in gene deserts and pericentromeres as compared to telomeres relates to their locations in the genome. pericentromeres and gene deserts are in the middle of a chromosome between genes  and therefore they need h3k9me <dig> which will interact with hp <dig>  <cit>  to prevent transcription from occurring. subtelomeres do not require such an enrichment of h3k9me <dig> 

a further conclusion from the results in table  <dig>  is that the modifications found in gene deserts are a subset of the modifications that are found at pericentromeres. both contain repressive h3k9me2/ <dig>  but pericentromeres also have h3r2me <dig>  h4k20me <dig> and h4r3me <dig>  this difference may be due to the replication associated functions of pericentromeres  <cit> . this is in addition to the requirement of a constitutive heterochromatin sequence at centromeres  <cit> .

a recent study  <cit>  looked at constitutive heterochromatic regions of the genome by aligning chip-seq reads to consensus sequences for repetitive elements and found that h3k9me <dig> and h4k20me <dig> were strongly enriched. we have reached a similar conclusion, but were able to separate the centromeric and telomeric regions and distinguish the modifications that are enriched in each of these regions. we found that the enrichment of h3k20me <dig> in non-coding regions is largely due to its high level in pericentromeres and that it is found at lower levels in subtelomeres and gene deserts.

the comparisons between non-coding regions and genes with different levels of expression have allowed us to determine the histone modifications enriched in each region. we have found that silent genes have a distinct histone modification profile that is not merely an intermediate between genes with high levels of expression and non-genic regions. non-coding regions are characterized by high levels of h3k9me2/ <dig> whereas silent genes are characterized by h3k27me <dig>  this is contrary to previous studies that have grouped h3k9me2/ <dig> and h3k27me <dig> as repressive modifications  <cit>  without identifying significant differences between them. our higher resolution and sharper distinction between the genomic regions allowed for this differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that regions of the genome that do not contain actively expressed genes do not have a monolithic histone modification profile. silent genes as well as different sub-categories of non-coding regions including gene deserts, subtelomeres and pericentromeres each have different significantly enriched histone modifications. we have also determined the histone modifications at highest levels in non-assembled telomeres and centromeres. additionally, we have found that for each histone residue studied different methylation states are enriched in different parts of the genome. it is therefore an oversimplification to speak about the function of methylation of a histone residue without specifying the methylation state under discussion.
