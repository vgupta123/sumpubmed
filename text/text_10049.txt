BACKGROUND
growth regulating factors  are plant-specific proteins that play important roles in regulating plant growth and development. a grf gene was first identified in rice where it encodes a protein that functions in regulating gibberellic acid -induced stem elongation
 <cit> .

the deduced protein products of grf genes contain two conserved domains in the n-terminal regions, the qlq and wrc domains. the qlq domain interacts with grf interacting factors  and the resulting complex acts as a transcriptional co-activator
 <cit> , while the wrc domain comprises a functional nuclear localization signal  and a zinc-finger motif that functions in dna binding
 <cit> .

currently, the grf gene family consists of nine arabidopsis thaliana genes
 <cit> ,  <dig> oryza sativa genes
 <cit> ,  <dig> zea mays genes
 <cit> , and  <dig> brachypodium distachyon genes
 <cit> . in these plants, the grf genes are strongly expressed in actively growing and developing tissues, such as shoot tips, flower buds, and immature leaves, but weakly expressed in mature tissues or organs. grf genes have been reported to act as positive regulators of leaf size through the promotion and/or maintenance of cell proliferation activity in leaf primordia
 <cit> . in brassica napus, grf <dig> was found to enhance seed oil production by regulating cell number and plant photosynthesis
 <cit> . grf genes may act by regulating cell proliferation through the suppression of knox gene expression
 <cit> , which inhibits ga biosynthesis in the s-adenosyl methionine  cycle by down-regulating the key biosynthetic gene ga <dig> oxidase
, or by controlling the level of ga <dig> oxidase  <dig>  which degrades ga
 <cit> . recently, many studies have reported the involvement of grf genes in the regulation of flower development
.

chinese cabbage  is one of the most important vegetables for agricultural production in asia and, although it originated in china, it is increasingly popular in other countries around the world. yield enhancement is now one of the critical targets of plant breeding programs focused on genetic improvement. understanding the functions of grf genes in regulating organ size in chinese cabbage will achieve this objective. however, knowledge about the molecular features of grf genes in chinese cabbage is limited. therefore, identifying and characterizing grf genes in chinese cabbage is of great interest.

in this study,  <dig> putative grf genes of chinese cabbage were identified from the brassica database 
 <cit> . the expression patterns of these brgrfs and the molecular features of the translated brgrf proteins were analyzed, and the function of brgrf <dig> was studied further. the results indicated that grf genes had higher expression levels in immature organs or tissues than in mature ones, and their transcription was induced by gibberellic acid . further analysis showed that cell proliferation was enhanced in transgenic plants.

RESULTS
identification of the brgrfs
based on the recently sequenced b. rapa line chiifu genome and annotated genes
 <cit> ,  <dig> brgrfs were identified from the brassica database  and designated brgrf1–brgrf <dig> according to their distribution in the genome . the coding sequence  lengths of the brgrfs varied widely; brgrf <dig> was the longest  and brgrf <dig> was the shortest . the intron/exon structures of the brgrfs were determined by aligning the cdss to the genomic sequence. the results indicated that all the brgrf gene sequences contained introns in their cdss. the number of introns varied from one to nine ; however, most of the genes  had three introns, followed by four introns , two introns , and one and nine introns . this result was similar to the findings from previous studies on arabidopsis  where most atgrfs contained three introns 
 <cit> , and on rice  where most osgrfs had two introns , followed by three introns , and four introns . additionally, the number of introns in the cdss of grf genes in the same subfamily was different. for example, brgrf <dig>  brgrf <dig>  and brgrf <dig>  which belong to subfamily a , had three, nine, and three introns respectively.table  <dig>

simple sequence repeat  markers are useful for a variety of applications in plant genetic mapping and molecular breeding because of their genetic codominance, abundance, dispersal throughout the genome, multi-allelic variation, high reproducibility, and high level of polymorphisms
 <cit> . in this study,  <dig> ssr markers, including nine di-, six tri-, and one hexa-nucleotide motifs were detected in the  <dig> identified brgrfs using the online ssr identification tool ssrit . further, brgrf <dig>  brgrf <dig>  brgrf <dig>  and brgrf <dig> had two ssr markers each, brgrf2–brgrf <dig>  brgrf <dig>  brgrf <dig>  and brgrf <dig> genes had only one ssr marker each, and brgrf <dig>  brgrf7–brgrf <dig>  and brgrf <dig> genes had no ssr markers. of the detected ssrs in these genes, seven were detected in exons and nine were detected in introns.table  <dig>

the brgrfs were unevenly distributed across the chromosomes , which is similar to previous results in arabidopsis and rice

conserved domains and motifs in the predicted brgrf proteins
the modular structures of grf proteins have been studied thoroughly in arabidopsis
 <cit> , rice
 <cit> , maize
 <cit> , and brachypodium distachyon
 <cit> . based on this information, we used the meme web server  to analyze the domain distribution in brgrfs. motif  <dig>  specified as the qlq domain, was predicted to be present in  <dig> of the  <dig> brgrfs, brgrf <dig> was the exception . we found that although brgrf <dig> could encode the qlq domain, the deletion of two adenine residues at positions  <dig> and 63 bp in the brgrf <dig> sequence compared with the brgrf <dig> sequence caused a frameshift that introduced a tag stop codon that truncated the brgrf <dig> protein sequence . motif  <dig>  specified as the wrc domain, was predicted in all  <dig> brgrf proteins. the results also indicated that atgrf <dig> and brgrf <dig> contained a second motif  <dig> downstream of the first. additionally, motif  <dig>  specified as the ggpl domain, was observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> brgrf proteins, including brgrf <dig>  brgrf <dig>  brgrf4–brgrf <dig>  brgrf9–brgrf <dig>  brgrf <dig>  brgrf <dig>  and brgrf <dig> .figure  <dig>

phylogenetic relationships and duplication events of the brgrfs
classifying genes and constructing a phylogeny are important for the functional analysis of a gene family. a phylogenetic tree of the  <dig> predicted brgrfs,  <dig> rice grfs  and nine arabidopsis grfs  was constructed using mega <dig>  with the bootstrap–neighbor-joining method. the  <dig> brgrf proteins were classified into six subgroups: a, brgrf <dig>   <dig>  and 10; b, brgrf <dig> and 9; c, brgrf <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 17; d, brgrf5; e, brgrf12; f, brgrf <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the phylogenetic tree suggested that the brgrf proteins were closest to the atgrf proteins and more distant from the osgrf proteins . the phylogenetic tree also indicated a number of putative homologous pairs: brgrf14/atgrf <dig> , brgrf16/atgrf <dig> , brgrf7/atgrf <dig> , brgrf10/atgrf <dig> , brgrf9/atgrf <dig> , brgrf4/atgrf <dig> , brgrf11/atgrf <dig> , brgrf5/atgrf <dig> , and brgrf12/atgrf <dig>  . additionally, by comparing the meme and phylogenetic tree analyses, we found that these homologous pairs usually had similar motif structures; for example, the brgrf12/atgrf <dig> pair had two wrc domains in their n-terminus .

analyzing the duplication events that may have occurred in the chinese cabbage genome during evolution will help in understanding the evolutionary mechanisms of the brgrfs. paralogous relationships for these brgrfs have been displayed in http://brassicadb.org/brad/. the results indicated that there were three set of triplicated genes in the chinese cabbage genome: brgrf <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the f block; brgrf <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the j block; and brgrf <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the n block . the other brgrf genes were either duplicated or singletons. no tandem duplication event was detected in the brgrf family.table  <dig>

putative functional analysis of the brgrf proteins
the gene ontology  database  is an international standardized gene functional classification system that offers a dynamically updated controlled vocabulary that comprehensively describes the properties of genes and their products in any organism under three main categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. in this study, the  <dig> predicted brgrfs were assigned go terms. the results indicated that most of brgrfs  were annotated with terms in the same go groups, including atp binding; hydrolase activity, acting on acid anhydrides, in phosphorus-containing anhydrides under the molecular function category, regulation of transcription under the biological process category, and nucleus under the cellular component category . these data implied that these brgrf proteins could have similar biological functions. brgrf <dig> was also annotated with terms related to hydrolase activity, acting on ester bonds; nuclease activity; dna binding; recombinase activity under the molecular function category, and response to dna damage stimulus; dna recombination; dna repair; nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process under the biological process category. this result suggested that brgrf <dig> may be involved in nucleic acid metabolic processes.

expression patterns of the brgrfs and brgifs 
grf proteins play important roles in the growth and development in plants
. to understand which grf genes may be involved in regulating specific tissue or organ growth in chinese cabbage, the expression patterns of the brgrfs in various tissues were investigated by real-time quantitative pcr . the results indicated that all  <dig> brgrfs had higher expression levels in young leaves compared with in old leaves, except for the brgrf <dig> and brgrf <dig>  which were undetectable in all the tissues examined . in addition, brgrf <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had higher expression levels in buds than in blooming flowers, whereas brgrf <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had higher expression levels in blooming flowers than in buds. the expression levels of brgrf <dig> were highest in root tissues. the brgrfs that were expressed mainly in certain organs or tissues might play important roles in the growth and development of these organs or tissues.figure  <dig>

the response to ga <dig> treatment was also investigated. compared with distilled water  treatment, the transcript levels of brgrf <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were increased more than 5-fold and brgrf <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were increased 2- to 5-fold in response to 100 μm ga <dig> application . the expression levels of the other brgrfs were only slightly affected  or not affected by the ga <dig> treatment.figure  <dig>

grf and gif proteins may act as transcription activators or coactivators, respectively, as part of a complex involved in the growth and development in plants
 <cit> . therefore, the expression patterns of brgif genes, including bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig> and bra <dig> were also investigated by rt-qpcr.

the results indicated that the bra <dig>  bra <dig>  and bra <dig> genes had the highest expression levels in buds, while bra <dig> and bra <dig> had the highest expression levels in young leaves . additionally, the transcript expression levels of brgifs could be increased by ga <dig> treatment. at 3 h after ga <dig> treatment, the transcript levels were  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold higher for bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig> and bra <dig>  respectively, compared with their levels after dw treatment .

ectopic expression of brgrf8in arabidopsis increases organ size
compared with the other brgrfs, brgrf <dig> had the highest transcription level ratio between immature and mature leaves, implying that it might play an important role in the growth and development of chinese cabbage leaves. to explore the functions of brgrf <dig>  we examined the arabidopsis phenotypes caused by the ectopic expression of this gene. the transgenic line developed larger leaves and other organs compared with the vector control lines. quantitatively, the dimensions of each of the first  <dig> leaves , including leaf width, leaf length, and petiole length, increased dramatically in the 35s:brgrf <dig> transgenic plants  compared with their dimensions in the vector control plants. however, there was little difference between the 35s:brgrf <dig> and vector control plants in terms of silique size and seed number per silique . the increase in leaf area in the brgrf <dig> over-expressers was mediated directly by an increase in cell number because the adaxial epidermal surface cell sizes were normal .figure  <dig>

discussion
previous studies have shown that grf genes have positive functions in regulating organ size by promotion and/or maintenance of cell proliferation activity
 <cit> . however, it is not known whether or how grf proteins in chinese cabbage regulate organ size. because grf proteins in different species may have different regulatory roles during the process of plant development, it is necessary to study the grf genes in each species to understand the mechanisms of plant organ size control. in this study, a comprehensive set of  <dig> non-redundant grf proteins were identified and characterized. although the b. rapa genome is approximately 4-fold larger than the arabidopsis genome , the gene number in b. rapa is only twice that of arabidopsis , suggesting that there was extensive gene loss during genome duplication
 <cit> .

pseudogenes are non-functional copies of gene fragments incorporated into the genome either by retrotransposition of mrna or by duplication of genomic dna. pseudogenes are widely distributed in eukaryotic genomes. sequence alignment showed that the brgrf <dig> and brgrf <dig> gene sequences were highly similar, and that there was a deletion of two a residues in the brgrf <dig> cds compared with the brgrf <dig> cds that lead to the introduction of a premature stop codon. because, brgrf <dig> gene expression was not detected in the various tissues, even after ga <dig> treatment, we suggest that brgrf <dig> may be a pseudogene in the chinese cabbage genome.

phylogenetic analysis of the predicted grf protein sequences from chinese cabbage, arabidopsis, and rice indicated that the brgrfs shared higher similarity with atgrfs than with osgrfs, which is consistent with their evolutionary relationships: chinese cabbage and arabidopsis are both dicots of the brassicaceae family, while rice is a monocot of the poaceae family. additionally, the phylogenetic and gene duplication analyses revealed that the brgrfs contained three triplets, two duplicates, and four singletons. however, none of the brgrfs exhibited tandem duplication. these results suggest that the expansion of the brgrfs could be explained by the ancestor genome of b. rapa experiencing a whole-genome triplication and evolving finally into chinese cabbage
 <cit> .

the brgrfs were expressed mainly in specific organs and tissues, suggesting that they may play important roles in the growth and development of these organs or tissues. we found that the transcript levels of the brgrf <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were higher in young leaves than in the other tested tissues, suggesting that these genes are involved mainly in the growth and development of young leaves in chinese cabbage. thus, improving the expression levels of these genes might help improve chinese cabbage leaf head yield.

ga <dig> is involved in various physiological processes in plants and knox proteins contribute to the regulation of meristem maintenance by negatively regulating the production of gibberellins
. therefore, downregulation of knox gene expression at the flanks of the sam cycle was reported to increase the level of ga, resulting in organized cell proliferation and determination of cell fate
 <cit> . a previous study showed that grf proteins act as repressors and down-regulators of knox gene expression
 <cit> . as reported previously in rice
 <cit> , the transcription of most brgrfs was induced by ga <dig> treatment. these results suggested that the grf genes may function in maintaining or promoting cell proliferation in plants by a feedback regulation mechanism, in which the grf genes positively regulate the production of gibberellins, and gas in turn upregulate grf gene expression.

in previous studies, the over-expression of grf genes in arabidopsis was found to result in bigger organ size than the vector control
 <cit> , while reduction of atgrf gene expression by the overexpression of the microrna mir <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis caused narrow-leaf phenotypes due to a reduction in cell number
. here, we found that the ectopic expression of brgrf <dig> also increased leaf size in arabidopsis. in addition, our histological results revealed a significant increase in cell number but not in cell size in the 35s:brgrf <dig> transgenic arabidopsis plants compared with the vector control plants, suggesting that brgrf <dig> may control the growth of plant organs by regulating cell proliferation rather than by enlarging cell volume.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> members of the chinese cabbage grf gene family that encoded putative grf proteins that fell into six subfamilies. the phylogenetic relationships among chinese cabbage, rice, and arabidopsis grf genes, suggested that the brgrfs were more closely allied with atgrfs than with osgrfs. further, phylogenetic and duplication event analysis suggested that whole genome duplication may have been the main contributor to the expansion of the brgrfs. additionally, the ectopic expression of brgrf <dig> in arabidopsis positively controlled organ size by regulating cell proliferation. the expression profiles obtained by rt-qpcr showed that the brgrfs may be involved in immature organ or tissue growth and development via the ga pathway. together, these data will not only contribute to a further understanding of the characteristics and functions of the grf family in different species, but will also provide a promising strategy for chinese cabbage breeding programs to improve yield/head size.
