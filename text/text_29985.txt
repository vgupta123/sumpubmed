BACKGROUND
the infectious diseases caused by gram-positive cocci are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the extensive use of antibacterial agents has promoted the selection and dissemination of resistant clones of these cocci in hospital and community environments. among the most worrying are vancomycin-resistant enterococci , methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae
 <cit> . treatments must now frequently be extended, and therapeutic failure is on the increase. this is not helped by the small number of targets sought out by the antibiotics used in the clinical setting; indeed, our present antibiotic arsenal focuses on just some  <dig> bacterial proteins . further, only half a dozen new antibacterial agents have reached the market over the last 10 years, and resistance to these was promptly detected in clinical practice  <cit> . moreover, these new drugs are associated with undesirable side effects  <cit>  and may suffer inactivation in some parts of the body  <cit> . the need to discover proteins essential to pathogens that can act as new therapeutic targets is therefore clear.

the roles of many of the proteins apparently involved in the pathobiology of gram-positive cocci are poorly understood. this is particularly true with respect to the transition from commensal to pathogenic status. different bacterial pathogens appear to make use of similar strategies to infect their hosts; this is particularly notable among the pathogens that cause pneumonia, sepsis, endocarditis and meningitis  <cit> . in s. pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, proteins involved in metabolic pathways leading to coccal chain length reduction to just one or two cells have been related to virulence via the impairment of complement fixation and subsequent opsophagocytosis  <cit> . a number of pathogens also rely on the autolysis – sometimes non-fatal – of some of their population. this releases highly inflammatory fragments of cell wall and cytoplasmic virulence factors into host tissues, and frees other virulence factors, facilitating invasion by the population as a whole .

while the molecular basis of these common invasion strategies remains largely unknown, it likely involves the complex interplay of different proteins. its examination via high-throughput experiments  and systems biology techniques is therefore highly desirable. microarrays are now being used to reveal changes in global transcription under different conditions, signature-tagged mutagenesis  is being used to determine the genes essential under different infective scenarios  <cit> , and “antigenome” techniques  <cit>  are being used to determine the bacterial immunogenic polypeptides recognized by antisera from patients or carrier individuals. many of the genes shown by these techniques to be involved in pathogenesis encode “hypothetical proteins” , i.e., those for which no exact function can be inferred. the term ‘hp’ covers the potential polypeptides associated with: 1) open reading frames  that code for no protein at all, typically those smaller than  <dig> codons  <cit> , 2) truncated and degenerated pseudogenes, 3) species- or strain-specific genes , 4) remote superfamily homologues, and 5) genes present in many organisms  <cit> . the wide taxonomic distribution of this fifth type of hp  suggests these proteins could be of great importance to cells. chps are a heterogeneous collection of proteins that have proven very difficult to work with in the laboratory, or they have very complex domain combinations that hinder any prediction of functionality. they often contain domains of unknown function , classified by the pfam protein domain resource as domains lacking sufficiently documented activities  <cit> . pfam provides a curated library of profile hidden markov models for  <dig>  conserved domain families for which the relative abundance of dufs increases with every new version   <cit> .

genes poorly characterized, or not characterized at all, account for 28% of the pneumococcal core genome  <cit> . many of these have been shown essential for survival in vitro
 <cit> , in nasal colonization  <cit> , and during the infection of the ear  <cit> , lung  <cit>  and cerebrospinal fluid  <cit> . however, their contribution to bacterial physiology has not been further analysed, hindering advances in our understanding of how they may be involved in bacterial virulence  <cit> . in the post-genomic age, orchestrated bioinformatic and biochemical initiatives are required to remedy this lack of knowledge  <cit> . such a characterization of the hps – and especially of the chps – encoded would be of enormous value  <cit> : it would increase the catalogue of protein functions potentially transferable to homologues in other bacteria  <cit> , help identify new virulence factors, and aid in the identification of new antimicrobial targets for medium-spectrum therapy  <cit> .

the present work examines the potential physiological and biomedical importance of  <dig> selected chps from s. pneumoniae with homologues in e. faecalis and/or s. aureus. different chps were found to have different domain architecture and to be differently involved in bacterial growth and morphology. five chps were found to be virulence factors, and one was recognized as a promising antibacterial target.

RESULTS
selection of conserved hypothetical proteins
s. pneumoniae is a major pathogen suitable as a model system for biomedical studies  <cit> . in order to select chps of s. pneumoniae r <dig> that were truly uncharacterised and that were chemically amenable to experimental analysis,  <dig> potential chps were initially selected . these comprised proteins already annotated as hps, as well as those containing duf domains or only partially covered  by pfam domains. hps with a narrow taxonomic distribution, without homologues in e. faecalis and s. aureus, or of small size , were then rejected. this rejection by size involved all those potential hps of < <dig> residues. those between  <dig> and  <dig> residues were not rejected if they met one of the following conditions:  mean identity to streptococcal homologues of at least 60%,  at least one hte hit , or  the possession of two or more cysteine residues  in the amino acidic sequence. finally, those hps showing evidence of being difficult to handle experimentally were also rejected, i.e., large  and membrane-embedded proteins. however, those membrane proteins with ≤ <dig> transmembrane helices plus a contiguous span of ≥ <dig> non-membrane residues were contemplated in the analysis. these exclusions led to a list of  <dig> hps. using the blast tool, their current annotation status was manually checked against the uniprot database  <cit> , and their domain architecture checked using the pfam domain organization database. certainly, the available s. pneumoniae r <dig> annotation which was published 12 years ago is now largely obsolete  <cit> , and although many of the hps examined had consistent functional annotations,  <dig>   remained uncharacterised, annotated by vague descriptors, or simply associated functionally to promiscuous superfamilies . for example, spr <dig> belongs to the asch superfamily and spr <dig> to the p-loop atpases superfamily. these superfamilies have different roles in rna binding/metabolism  <cit>  and macromolecule remodelling  <cit>  respectively, which prevents direct functional annotation. the  <dig> uncharacterised proteins, several of which are apparently nucleic acid  binding proteins  , were selected for further analysis.figure  <dig>

classification of the  <dig> selected chps into  <dig> classes based on domain architecture, sequence conservation and interactivity
the mapping of the pfam domains in the  <dig> proteins revealed two architectural classes. the first class, duf proteins, was composed of  <dig> rather small  monodomain chps; a single pfam profile occupied most of their entire length . the second class, modular proteins, involved  <dig>  multidomain proteins with either ≥ <dig> pfam domains or  <dig> pfam domain plus additional unclassified sections long enough to be a domain   . such proteins typically contain promiscuous domains of known general activity  that tend to combine with other domains to endow novel functionalities  <cit> . modular proteins are, on average, twice as long as duf proteins , and may have complex architecture  and even contain duf domains. the pfam profiles only covered  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the length of the modular proteins when the gathering thresholds recommended by the pfam administrators were taken into account . the nature of the remaining unclassified regions was subjected to: 1) the detection of additional pfam domains with low e-values , even though they did not satisfy their respective gathering thresholds  ; 2) searching for other regions covered by the pfam-b database , a non-curated additional pfam database containing domain families with a typically narrow taxonomic distribution; and 3) the detection of any segment of any remaining section predicted to be unstructured, a coiled-coil, or as having low-complexity residue composition. a high concentration of these kinds of element in a given protein section is suggestive of it having a role that requires there be fewer structural constraints, e.g., when acting as a dimerization zone or flexible stalk.figure  <dig> 
domain and motif architecture of modular proteins. sequence domain and motifs were successively mapped on the sequence using the prevalence system established by the top-down order indicated in the inset. elements were only considered if they did not overlap by more than  <dig> residues with a previously established element. the pfam domain description, location and e-values are provided in additional file 7: table s <dig> 



high sequence conservation  <cit>  and interaction with many other protein partners  <cit>  provide indirect proof of biological importance. the  <dig> selected chps differed in terms of sequence identity with homologues in other streptococci and the number of predicted interacting partners . twenty three chps showed ≥75% identity to their streptococcal homologues and/or ≥ <dig> protein-protein interactions  . these hic proteins would be expected to play basic roles in the physiology of gram-positive cocci. a four-class classification of chps – duf-hic, duf-non hic, modular-hic and modular-non hic – is hereafter used to describe these chps.figure  <dig>

chps and high-throughput experiments: appearance in the literature
many bacterial pathogens occupy a number of niches in humans. htes can detect genes important for the successful colonization of new environments. the results of microarray experiments on s. pneumoniae performed under  <dig> environmental conditions, of stms involving ear, lung, nasal and meningial infection, and of one antigenome experiment were examined . thirty five out of the  <dig> chps studied appeared in 1– <dig> conditions . a normalized hte score was then derived ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . for non-hic proteins, the hte score was, on average, twice that of the hic proteins . the association between high hte scores and the non-hic class suggests these proteins play accessory functions adaptable to specific conditions rather than constant housekeeping activities.

gene essentiality and protein druggability: the spr0479gene encodes a promising antibacterial target
to assess the biological importance of the selected chps, the encoding genes were substituted by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette by double recombination. forty knockout mutants were obtained , but no viable knockouts were obtained for spr <dig>  spr <dig>  spr <dig> and spr <dig> even after three attempts ; these genes were therefore classified as potentially essential. these genes may encode chps that could be used as targets in antimicrobial therapy. however, an ideal target must also be druggable, i.e., it must be able to bind ligands that modulate the protein’s function, and this must eventually lead to the bacterium’s death, or at least the prevention of its growth. the existence and availability of a high-quality structure for at least one homologue, a condition fulfilled by  <dig> of the  <dig> potentially essential chps , is an indispensable prerequisite for the detection of potential drug-binding cavities. in order to cover the range of binding-pocket structures, and the different chemical properties of their natural ligands, a consensus of nine independent strategies was used: the seven algorithms of metapocket  <dig>   <cit> , and the dogsitescorer  <cit>  and lise  <cit>  algorithms .figure  <dig>

despite the fact that three well-defined pockets were found in bacillus subtilis yuei protein, the homologue structurally resolved closest to spr <dig>  the lack of identity between these proteins  suggests drugs against this protein family would only have a narrow spectrum of activity. the next essential chp studied, spr <dig> showed strong identity  to the putative stress protein ynzc from b. subtilis
 <cit> . although dogsitescorer divided the large interhelical cavity into two parts, lise and metapocket failed to find any consistent pocket in this structure; this protein was therefore deemed non-drugable.

in contrast, there is evidence that suggests spr <dig> may be a promising target for rational drug design. the structure of spr <dig> is known at high resolution   <cit> , and provides an excellent dataset of atomic coordinates. a cleft has been found by all the cavity-detection algorithms used. spr <dig> is predicted to interact with proteins involved in translation , one of the processes most commonly targeted by antibacterial agents. the spr <dig> sequence shares 40-51% identity  with orthologues from gram-positive pathogens highly recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy, such as clostridium difficile, e. faecium and s. aureus. in addition, the pfam family of spr <dig> has no members in the homo sapiens proteome. to ascertain the essentiality of the spr <dig> gene, an ectopic additional gene copy under a zn-inducible promoter was introduced into a disposable chromosomal site . the native spr <dig> gene copy could not be removed  unless 10 μm zncl <dig> was added to the medium . these results indicate that the second gene copy rescued cell viability in a zn-inducible manner, and explicitly confirms the essentiality of spr <dig>  future investigations on chemical ligands binding to spr <dig> may allow the design of new antibacterial agents that target this essential protein.

some viable knockouts grow more slowly and/or show a chaining phenotype
the growth rate and cell morphologies of knockout mutants for non-essential genes were then examined. two of them, Δspr <dig> and Δspr <dig>  were able to grow in the semi-synthetic pneumococcal-specific agch-sye medium, but grew deficiently in the more universal thye medium . these knockouts were therefore classified as “medium-dependent”. a correlation was seen between the severity of the mutant phenotype and the protein class involved. genes coding for duf-hic proteins were over-represented in the lethal or medium-dependent knockouts obtained since five of the six genes involved belong to this class . the reduction in biological fitness observed in hic knockouts suggests that these proteins play fundamental roles. similarly, proteins central to the interactome network of saccharomyces cerevisiae are often essential for its viability  <cit> . further, ppis have been used to detect putative antimicrobial targets in pseudomonas aeruginosa
 <cit> . in contrast, non-hic proteins may be more physiologically isolated, i.e., adapted to more specific roles under particular conditions . thus, roles may be inferred for hic and non-hic proteins as antimicrobial targets and virulence factors respectively.

knockouts for  <dig> of the genes had duplication times 10-46% longer than that of the wild type . one of the slowest knockouts, Δspr <dig>  was reported non-viable in one study  <cit>  but viable in another  <cit> , underscoring the importance of the experimental setup when defining essentiality.figure  <dig>

all the knockouts viable in thye medium  were visualized by optical microscopy and the average number of coccoid units per chain calculated. while the wild type grew mainly in a diplococcal fashion ,  <dig> of the  <dig> knockouts showed longer morphologies . of these, seven knockouts formed short chains  and three formed long chains . the severe separation defect of these last three mutants is similar to that seen for Δlytb, which is deficient in a protein involved in the separation of daughter cells  <cit> .

the genes deleted in five of the  <dig> chaining knockouts presumably encode dna-binding proteins . the lack of these proteins might cause epistatic effects leading to chaining via the loss of the regulatory transcriptional equilibrium that maintains diplococcal morphology. similar results have been reported by dahlia and weisser, who found an abundance of genes coding for either regulators or enzymes in random knockouts with defective diplococcal separation  <cit> . chaining would therefore appear to be a meta-phenotype reachable via several direct  or indirect  alterations.

some chaining knockouts show defective autolysis
since modifications to the cell wall typically cause a chaining phenotype and reduce susceptibility to antibiotics targeting enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis  <cit> , cultures of chaining knockouts showing normal growth  were challenged with either vancomycin or penicillin. both these antibiotics reduced the optical density  of a wild type culture by 10-fold, and cell viability by  <dig> orders of magnitude. in the presence of vancomycin, five of the knockouts showed an od <dig> reduced by 50% after 2 h, and a survival rate reduced by < <dig> orders of magnitude, in a similar fashion to the Δlyta knockout  . these results support that idea the vancomycin tolerance phenotype involves several genes  <cit> . in the presence of penicillin, two of these five knockouts  showed no reduction in od <dig> and survival was only diminished by one order of magnitude ; the remaining three  showed ~2-fold reductions in od <dig> and reduction of three orders of magnitude in survival  . this dual vancomycin and penicillin tolerance has also been observed in certain clinical isolates  <cit> . only the Δspr <dig> knockout appeared to have lost a putative dna-binding protein; the others likely lack enzymes directly affecting the composition, shape or thickness of the cell wall. cell wall status was therefore further assessed by treating these knockouts with  <dig> % deoxycholate , a bile salt that induces lyta-mediated lysis. all five knockouts were doc-resistant, suggesting the presence of an altered cell wall, which may require more lyta protein to lyse the cell than that natively produced. to check this, cultures were pre-treated with exogenous pneumococcal lyta prior to doc-treatment. in all cases, the cells underwent autolysis within 5 min of adding the doc , suggesting that the modified cell walls can still bind lyta and remain valid chemical substrates for this enzyme, although more is needed for lysis to occur. these findings also support the notion that defective autolysis is another meta-phenotype, like chaining, that results from the alteration of one or more several possible pathways.figure  <dig>

some knockouts showed attenuated virulence
since the selected knockouts had different combinations of chain length and lysis defects, their relative effect on infectivity was examined. equivalent knockouts were constructed in the highly virulent d <dig> strain , the pathogenic parental of r <dig>  the ability of these mutants to cause sepsis was evaluated. values significantly below  <dig> indicate that deletion causes the attenuation of pathogenesis. the control knockouts for defective autolysis and cell separation, Δlyta and Δlytb respectively, were slightly attenuated in their ability to compete with the wild type , confirming that the respective proteins contribute to pneumococcal pathogenesis. although lytb is involved in preventing phagocytosis, in particular when combined with lytc  <cit> , there is some controversy regarding the contribution of lyta towards pneumococcal pathogenesis in sepsis models. some authors suggest it has no effect  <cit> , while others report it to reduce bacterial titres by four logarithmic units  <cit>  – differences that might, however, be explained by experimental procedure. nevertheless, the slight reduction in virulence observed in the Δlyta and Δlytb control knockouts under the present conditions is optimal for quantifying additional infectivity loss when defective autolysis and chaining are combined in a single strain. strong attenuation  was observed for Δspr <dig> and Δspr <dig> , and for Δspr <dig> , suggesting that these genes play important roles in pathogenesis. moderate attenuation  was seen in Δspr <dig>  and Δspr <dig> . only slight attenuation  was observed for Δspr <dig>  and no attenuation for Δspr <dig> . the results for Δspr <dig> underscore the idea that while chaining and autolysis are important facets of virulence, they function in concert with other factors that might counteract them. nevertheless, chaining and defective autolysis do appear to have an apparent synergistic effect on sepsis. it is worth remembering that these knockouts had generation times similar to the wild type; their low cis can therefore can be attributed to a genuine reduction in virulence rather than a global loss of biological fitness.

our lack of precise knowledge regarding the contribution of these proteins to cell wall metabolism prevents any straightforward interpretation of the present results. however, the rhodanase-like domain detected in spr <dig>  a domain present in a superfamily of enzymes involved in sulphur reactions  <cit> , suggests that this protein might be involved in sulphur metabolism. in addition, spr <dig> shares remote homology with lysozymes, although its exact biochemical activities and cellular role remain to be elucidated. spr <dig> is a putative outer protein, given that it has signal peptide and immunogenic properties  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this paper reports an attempt to characterize the genes coding for chps in gram-positive cocci using s. pneumoniae as a model organism. these proteins were organized into two architectural groups, i.e., monodomain dufs and modular, and two potential levels of importance in terms of sequence conservation and interaction, i.e., hic and non-hic proteins. deletion of hic-protein-encoding genes suggests their products often play central physiological roles. in contrast, non-hic proteins would seem to be more related to adaptation to infective conditions.

spr <dig> is a chp that might have potential as a novel target for antibiotherapy. it is essential for bacterial growth and is predicted to interact with protein partners involved in translation. its crystal structure shows a cleft with drugability potential, and its high sequence conservation across bacterial pathogens makes it attractive as a therapeutic target. in addition, five proteins – spr <dig>  spr <dig>  spr <dig>  spr <dig> and spr <dig> – that might participate in cell wall metabolism were found involved in pathogenesis. their respective knockouts lost classic diplococcal morphology and they could not effectively undergo autolysis, two properties required for full virulence to be realised. finally, virulence factors spr <dig> and spr <dig> are two apparent cell wall enzymes with a small number of interacting partners and high hte-scores; these proteins may act in concert in several organisms to provide a physiological background in which host invasion becomes more efficient.
