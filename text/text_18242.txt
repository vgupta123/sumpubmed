BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal  tract is a vital organ, highly conserved across vertebrate species and essential for the absorption of water and nutrients. during development, the gi tract arises from a primary uniform tube composed of mesoderm and endoderm. the mesoderm gives rise to the digestive mesenchyme, which in turn differentiates into multiple tissues, such as the submucosa and the musculature, which is composed of smooth muscle cells  and interstitial cells of cajal  <cit> . the process of digestive mesenchyme development into smcs is commonly decomposed into two major steps  <cit> . mesenchymal progenitor cells first enter a determination program , mainly characterized by the early expression of alpha smooth muscle actin . later during development, determined smcs enter a more differentiated state , mainly characterized by the expression of proteins involved in smooth muscle contractility, such as calponin and caldesmon.

unlike many other mature cell types in the adult body, such as skeletal muscle cells, smcs do not terminally differentiate but instead harbour a remarkable capacity to dedifferentiate. indeed, smcs have the unique ability to switch between a differentiated, quiescent contractile state and a highly proliferative and migratory phenotype in response to internal or external cues  <cit> . smc plasticity plays crucial roles in maintaining muscular tissue homeostasis during perinatal development and postnatal stages. in humans, the disruption of this balance is a major underlying cause of disease  <cit> . because tissue plasticity involves the reactivation of developmental processes, developmental studies of the process regulating the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into smcs have proven to be useful in identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of digestive musculature plasticity during normal development and in pathological conditions  <cit> .

using a microarray approach to identify candidate genes in stomach mesenchyme development  <cit> , an approach that had already enabled our group to characterize the rna-binding protein rbpms <dig> as a regulator of smc differentiation and plasticity  <cit> , we screened for genes that demonstrated higher expression at the earliest stages of stomach development. this allowed us to identify limb expression  <dig> , a gene coding for a 281-amino acid protein. although predictive in silico studies have shown that lix <dig> has a double-stranded rna binding domain, suggesting that it could be involved in rna processing  <cit> , no cellular function of lix <dig> has yet been described. chicken  lix <dig>  first identified in a gene expression screen to identify new markers of limb development, was shown to be expressed in the anterior and posterior intestinal portals, the early structures that invaginate to give rise to the primary intestinal tube  <cit> . moreover, the arthropod homolog of lix <dig>  lowfat, has been characterized, through its interaction with the atypical cadherins fat and dachsous, as a component of the hippo pathway  <cit> . the hippo pathway has been at the centre of many studies regarding its role in maintaining tissue homeostasis through the regulation of the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. the key downstream regulator of the hippo pathway is yes-associated protein , a transcriptional co-activator that mainly interacts with transcription factors of the tead family, which are essential in mediating yap-dependent gene expression . indeed, the hippo core cascade of kinases is activated when proper cell density and organ size are reached, leading, in humans, to the inhibitory phosphorylation of yap <dig> on serine- <dig>  <cit> . this leads to decreased transcription of yap <dig> mitogenic targets, resulting in a decrease in cell proliferation and entry into a more differentiated state  <cit> . although lix <dig> has recently been shown to stimulate progenitor proliferation during skeletal muscle regeneration in mouse  <cit> , there is no evidence to date to support a role for lix <dig> in regulating the activity of yap <dig> in vertebrates.

in the present study, we investigated the roles of lix <dig> and yap <dig> during digestive smc development. we show that lix <dig> is a novel and, thus far, unique marker of stomach mesenchymal progenitors and that its expression is strong and highly dynamic during development. we demonstrate that lix <dig> stimulates the expression of yap <dig> transcripts and yap <dig> activity and that both lix <dig> and yap <dig> are key regulators of the development of stomach mesenchymal progenitors. finally, we show that yap <dig> activity is required for the regulation of the proliferation and differentiation of the stomach mesenchyme.

RESULTS
lix <dig> defines stomach mesenchymal progenitors
we previously screened for genes that demonstrated higher expression at the earliest stages of stomach development  <cit>  and found lix <dig> to be among them. real-time quantitative pcr  analyses on stomach extracts confirmed the dynamic and transitory nature of lix <dig> expression during stomach development . while high levels of lix <dig> transcripts were detected at embryonic day  <dig> , levels of lix <dig> transcripts quickly decreased with the onset of smc determination , to finally barely detectable levels at e <dig>  when smc differentiation occurred . in parallel, we monitored the levels of barx <dig>  a marker of stomach mesenchyme  <cit> , as well as srf and its co-activator myocardin, which control smc differentiation  <cit> , and found that, while the onset of myocardin expression occurs at e <dig> , the stage of smc determination, srf and barx <dig> were detected throughout all examined stages. these results suggest that lix <dig> is an early marker of stomach development. we further studied the precise expression pattern of lix <dig> in the developing gi tract by in situ hybridization analysis . strong lix <dig> expression was detected at e <dig> throughout the stomach mesenchyme and levels quickly decreased from e <dig> onwards . lix <dig> transcripts were mainly detected in the pylorus at e <dig> and in the most posterior part of the stomach at e <dig> . when comparing the dynamics of lix <dig> expression in the developing stomach with the kinetics of αsma, the early marker of smc determination in adjacent stomach sections, we observed that their expression domains appeared mutually exclusive . while lix <dig> expression was high in stomach mesenchymal progenitors, it progressively decreased with the onset of smc determination, thus identifying lix <dig> as a novel and unique stomach marker, restricted to mesenchymal progenitors .fig.  <dig> transient expression pattern of lix <dig> in the developing chick stomach. a

lix <dig> silencing impairs mesenchyme determination and decreases yap <dig> activity
the complementarity between lix <dig> and αsma expression prompted us to investigate whether lix <dig> is required for the process of stomach smc determination. this was accomplished using the avian replication-competent retroviral  transgenesis method that allows in vivo gain- or loss-of-function approaches of specific genes in the stomach mesenchyme   <cit> . we first performed lix <dig> loss-of-function experiments using rcas-shlix <dig>  retroviruses. when injected into the presumptive domain of the developing stomach, rcas-shlix <dig> retroviruses led to a specific decrease in endogenous lix <dig> expression, demonstrated by in situ hybridization and rt-qpcr analyses . in situ hybridization analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of the smc determination marker sm <dig> in e <dig>  shlix1-expressing stomachs compared to controls  upon lix <dig> silencing. this was confirmed by rt-qpcr analysis . in contrast, injection of unrelated rcas-shrna retroviruses, which do not target lix <dig>  had no effect on αsma expression . moreover, when rcas-shlix <dig> retroviruses were co-injected with rcas-hlix <dig> retroviruses, which induce the expression of the human lix <dig> protein insensitive to the chick-specific rcas-shlix <dig> retroviruses, normal expression of αsma was restored, demonstrating the specificity of the shlix <dig> construct for lix <dig> . levels of barx <dig> transcripts were comparable in shlix1-expressing stomachs compared to controls, indicating that the patterning of the stomach was unaffected by lix <dig> silencing . we also observed a decrease in myocardin expression, while levels of srf transcripts were not significantly affected in e <dig>  shlix1-expressing stomachs compared to controls . lix <dig> silencing induced a smaller determined-smc territory, as demonstrated by in situ hybridization  and immunostaining analyses on shlix1-expressing stomach sections compared to controls . the diminished expression of smc determination markers was associated with a 40 % decrease in the rate of cell proliferation in shlix1-expressing stomach sections compared to controls, as demonstrated by immunostaining analysis for phosphorylated histone 3-ser <dig> , a standard marker of the g2/m transition  <cit> . these results are in line with a role for lix <dig> in regulating cell proliferation, as previously shown in studies on cricket  and mouse that identified homologs of lix <dig> as positive regulators of cell proliferation  <cit> . lowfat, the arthropod homolog of lix <dig>  has been characterized, through its interaction with the atypical cadherins fat and dachsous, as a component of the hippo pathway  <cit> . as the key downstream regulator of the hippo pathway is the pro-proliferative gene yap <dig>  we next investigated whether lix <dig> regulates the expression of yap <dig> during this process. in situ hybridization and rt-qpcr analyses revealed that endogenous transcripts of yap <dig> and its transcriptional targets ctgf and cyr <dig>  known to stimulate cell proliferation  <cit> , are abundant during early development of the stomach . at this stage, their expression is detectable in both the mesenchymal and epithelial layers of the stomach, as demonstrated by rt-qpcr analyses on layer-dissociated stomach extracts . rt-qpcr analysis showed a reduction in the level of yap <dig> and its transcriptional targets ctgf and cyr <dig> in shlix1-expressing stomachs compared to controls . although expression data were significant for ctgf, but not for cyr <dig>  the results for both transcripts were consistent. we attribute the lack of significance for the second transcript to low statistical power rather than to absence of an effect. these results indicate that yap <dig> activity was decreased in shlix1-expressing stomachs compared to controls. moreover, lix <dig> silencing also induced a decrease in the expression of the tead transcription factor tead <dig> . taken together, our results show that, when lix <dig> expression was silenced in the developing stomach, smc determination was hindered. this was associated with a decrease in cell proliferation and a decrease in yap <dig> transcript levels and yap <dig> activity in the developing mesenchyme. our finding highlights the requirement of lix <dig> expression in the stomach mesenchymal progenitors to establish normal proliferation rates and allow proper smc determination.fig.  <dig>

lix <dig> misexpression expands the determined smc domain and stimulates cell proliferation and yap <dig> activity
we next induced a misexpression of lix <dig> in the stomach mesenchyme using rcas-lix <dig> retroviruses . this treatment did not drastically affect gi morphogenesis, as the morphology of lix1-misexpressing stomachs resembled that of control embryos . we first observed a premature expression of smc determination marker sm <dig> as early as e <dig>  in lix1-misexpressing stomachs, whereas smc determination had not yet taken place in controls, suggesting that lix <dig> misexpression facilitated smc determination . as a result, we observed at e <dig> that lix1-misexpressing stomachs harboured an expanded determined smc territory at the expense of the adjacent domains, mainly the intermuscular tendons and the submucosa. this was demonstrated both by whole-mount in situ hybridization, which showed a larger expression domain of determined smc markers sm <dig> and bapx <dig>  <cit>  in lix1-misexpressing stomachs compared to controls , and by αsma immunostaining on sections, showing that sustained lix <dig> expression led to a decrease in the size of the submucosa . accordingly, analysis of the enteric nervous system network using in situ hybridization of sox <dig> transcripts revealed that enteric nervous system precursors, which normally colonize the smc domain specifically  <cit> , had migrated into the adjacent tendon territory, further indicating an expanded smc domain in lix1-misexpressing stomachs compared to controls . further analysis by rt-qpcr confirmed that, compared to control stomachs, lix1-misexpressing stomachs harboured higher levels of smc determination marker αsma and barx <dig> transcripts at e <dig>  whereas myocardin and srf levels were not significantly affected . taken together, our in vivo results indicate that lix <dig> is not only necessary for correct smc determination, but that it also acts in favour of the process. these changes are associated with an increase in the rate of cell proliferation, as demonstrated by immunostaining analysis for ph <dig>  and consequently to an increase in mesenchymal cell density in e <dig> lix1-misexpressing stomachs compared to controls . the rate of cell death, however, was comparable in both conditions, as demonstrated by immunostaining analysis of cleaved caspase- <dig> . taking into account the positive effect of lix <dig> on smc proliferation and our previous results demonstrating that lix <dig> silencing impaired yap <dig> expression and activity, we suspected that lix <dig> overexpression would stimulate the expression of genes in the yap <dig> pathway. in fact, rt-qpcr analysis indicated a significant increase in the expression of yap <dig>  ctgf and tead <dig>  and a slight increase in the expression of cyr <dig> and tead <dig> in lix1-misexpressing stomachs compared to controls .fig.  <dig>

the differences in yap <dig> expression and activity observed in lix1-misexpressing stomachs could be linked to the changes in the identity of the tissue associated with aberrant lix <dig> expression, or could be due to a role of yap <dig> as a key relay in the establishment of the lix <dig> phenotype. we thus performed yap <dig> gain-of-function experiments in the developing stomach using rcas-yap <dig> retroviruses. we observed an expanded sm22-positive determined smc domain in yap1-misexpressing stomachs compared to control stomachs . rt-qpcr analysis indicated that yap <dig> misexpression did not affect the endogenous expression of lix <dig>  and confirmed an increase in the transcript levels of the smc determination markers αsma and myocardin at e <dig> . levels of barx <dig>  srf, tead <dig> and tead <dig> were not significantly affected in yap1-misexpressing stomachs compared to control stomachs . moreover, changes in expression of smc determination markers were associated with an increase in cell proliferation, as demonstrated by immunostaining analysis for ph <dig> . our results thus demonstrate that lix <dig> stimulates the endogenous level of yap <dig> transcripts and yap <dig> activity and that sustained yap <dig> activity phenocopies lix <dig> misexpression regarding stomach mesenchyme determination. furthermore, when rcas-shlix <dig> retroviruses were co-injected with rcas-yap <dig> retroviruses, the expression of lix <dig> was not rescued . however, the restored yap <dig> activity  rescued the expression of αsma . altogether, these data demonstrate that yap <dig> is a key relay in the establishment of the lix <dig> phenotype.fig.  <dig>

endogenous lix <dig> expression is regulated by the fgf pathway during smc determination
collectively, our in vivo loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that lix <dig> expression must be finely regulated in the stomach mesenchyme to control the pool of progenitors required for correct smc determination, presumably through the regulation of yap <dig> activity. it has been shown that aberrant activation of the fgf pathway has a negative impact on stomach smc determination  <cit> . as we report that lix <dig> silencing impaired smc determination, we next investigated whether the expression of lix <dig> was under the control of the fgf signalling pathway. to address this question, we activated the fgf signalling pathway by misexpressing fgf <dig> in the stomach mesenchyme using rcas-fgf <dig> retroviruses and confirmed by rt-qpcr analysis that mesenchyme determination was hindered, as demonstrated by lower levels of αsma and sm <dig> transcripts in fgf8-misexpressing stomachs compared to controls . the upregulation of fgf activity was associated with a strong reduction in lix <dig> transcript levels compared to control stomachs, which was monitored by in situ hybridization  and confirmed by rt-qpcr analysis , and this was associated with a decrease in the levels of yap <dig> transcripts . these results suggest that sustained fgf activity during smc determination phenocopies lix <dig> loss-of-function. conversely, when using rcas-sfgfr2b retroviruses, which produce a secreted form of fgfr2b  <cit> , we found that inhibition of fgf pathway activity induced an increase in lix <dig> levels at e <dig>  compared to control stomachs . taken together, these results suggest that the fgf pathway regulates the endogenous expression of lix <dig> and thereby maintains the proper levels necessary to ensure correct stomach mesenchyme determination.fig.  <dig> endogenous lix <dig> expression is regulated by the fgf pathway during smooth muscle cell determination. a

sustained lix <dig> expression decreases yap <dig> activity and hinders smc differentiation
to further understand the role of lix <dig> in the development of the stomach mesenchyme, we next analysed the consequences of lix <dig> misexpression on smc differentiation, the later step of smc development. we found a reduction in the level of calponin protein at e <dig> in lix1-misexpressing stomachs, indicating that smc differentiation was impaired . a strong reduction in calponin transcript levels was also observed . additionally, we observed a decrease in the expression of myocardin, while levels of barx <dig> and srf transcripts were not significantly affected . the decrease in smc differentiation markers in lix1-misexpressing stomachs was also observed later in development at e <dig> , suggesting that the reduced level of differentiation markers did not simply reflect a delay in stomach smc development . we found that yap <dig> misexpression also hindered calponin expression, as demonstrated by immunostaining on stomach sections . this suggests that, while lix <dig> misexpression and yap <dig> stimulation had a positive impact on smc determination, they hindered smc differentiation. surprisingly, we found that, when lix <dig> expression was sustained in the developing stomach, the downregulation in the expression of smc differentiation markers was associated with a lower rate of proliferation . indeed, mesenchymal cell density was comparable in lix1-misexpressing stomach compared to controls . it has been shown that the hippo pathway acts as a sensor of cell density  <cit> , thus mediating the relationship between cell proliferation and cell contact inhibition of proliferation. as cell density becomes higher, the hippo pathway is activated, resulting in an inhibitory phosphorylation of yap <dig> and thus a decrease in cell proliferation  <cit> . interestingly, we observed a decrease in yap <dig> activity in yap1-misexpressing stomachs at e <dig> by western blot analysis monitored through an increase of the inactive phosphorylated form of yap <dig> compared to controls . the decrease in yap <dig> activity was confirmed by rt-qpcr analysis, which showed lower transcript levels of ctgf in yap1-misexpressing stomachs at e <dig> compared to controls . these results indicate that, while yap <dig> misexpression in the stomach stimulated yap <dig> transcriptional activity at determination stages, a decrease in yap <dig> activity was observed later on at differentiation stages. one possible explanation is that sustained lix <dig> expression led to a decrease in yap <dig> activity consecutive to cell contact inhibition of proliferation, as a consequence of the early stimulation of mesenchymal progenitor proliferation, and this could be inhibitory for smc differentiation. in line with this hypothesis, western blot analysis revealed an increase of the inactive phosphorylated form of yap <dig> compared to controls . the decrease in yap <dig> activity in lix1-misexpressing stomachs at e <dig> was further confirmed by rt-qpcr analysis, which showed lower transcript levels of yap <dig> targets cyr <dig> and ctgf in lix1-misexpressing stomachs compared to controls . additionally, we observed a decrease in tead <dig> transcript levels in lix1-misexpressing stomachs compared to controls . these data indicate that hippo signalling was activated as a result of sustained lix <dig> expression at e <dig>  altogether, our results demonstrate that lix <dig> has an early role in the process of stomach smc determination, through the regulation of yap1-induced mesenchymal progenitor proliferation. however, as stomach development proceeds, sustained lix <dig> expression has a negative impact on further smc differentiation and this is associated with a decrease in yap <dig> activity.fig.  <dig> sustained lix <dig> expression decreases yap <dig> activity and hinders smooth muscle cell differentiation. a serial transverse sections of e <dig> stomachs analysed either by in situ hybridization using the lix <dig> riboprobe or by immunofluorescence with anti-αsma and anti-calponin antibodies. nuclei were visualized with hoechst. black arrowheads in the lix <dig> panels indicate the area imaged at high power in the αsma and calponin panels. b rt-qpcr analysis of relative mrna expression in e <dig> stomachs. data were normalized to gapdh expression. values are presented as the mean ± standard deviation  of n =  <dig> controls vs. n =  <dig> lix1-expressing stomachs. *p <  <dig> ;

the ability of lix <dig> to regulate cell proliferation is dependent on cell density
these results prompted us to investigate the role of lix <dig> in regulating both proliferation and contact inhibition of proliferation in heterologous cell cultures. df- <dig> chicken fibroblasts were infected with empty rcas  or rcas-lix <dig> retroviruses and cultured for 5 days to ensure homogeneous expression. then, cells were seeded at low density . as expected according to our in vivo results demonstrating a positive effect of lix <dig> overexpression on the expression of yap <dig> , after 1 day in culture  lix1-expressing cells demonstrated a higher expression of yap <dig> transcript  and protein levels  compared to control cells. this greater expression was associated with higher transcript levels of yap <dig> target genes ctgf and cyr <dig>  and an increase in cell proliferation . interestingly, when lix1-expressing cells were treated with verteporfin, an inhibitor of the yap-tead interaction that abrogates yap activity but not its expression  <cit> , levels of ctgf and cyr <dig> transcripts  and rates of proliferation  were comparable with those of control cells. analysis of cell death in these cultures confirmed that this result was not due to a cytotoxic effect of verteporfin . these data demonstrate that, at low density, lix <dig> regulates cell proliferation through modulation of yap <dig> activity. after 3 days in culture, lix1-expressing cells had grown faster than control cells . however, although yap <dig> expression in lix1-expressing cells remained higher than in controls , the levels of ctgf and cyr <dig> transcripts were similar to control levels. in addition, we observed an increase of the inactive phosphorylated form of yap <dig> compared to controls in lix1-expressing cells , indicating that yap <dig> activity was downregulated at day  <dig> compared to day  <dig> . these data suggest that, under the influence of lix <dig>  a compensatory response to growing cell density took place. indeed, while lix <dig> acts to promote cell proliferation at low cell density, its pro-proliferation activity is abolished when cells had grown, suggesting that its ability to regulate cell proliferation is dependent upon cell density. in line with this hypothesis, when cells were seeded at high density, levels of ctgf and cyr <dig> transcripts, yap <dig> activity, and rates of proliferation were comparable in controls and lix1-expressing cells after 1 day in culture . the overexpression of lix <dig> in vitro thus recapitulates the effects we had observed under misexpression of lix <dig> in vivo during stomach mesenchyme development, suggesting that lix <dig> drives an increase in cell density that feeds back on the system to block the activity of yap <dig> and further proliferation.fig.  <dig> the ability of lix <dig> to regulate cell proliferation is dependent on cell density df- <dig> cells infected with control rcas or rcas-lix <dig> retroviruses. a phase contrast photomicrograph at day  <dig>  b rt-qpcr analysis of gene expression at day  <dig>  data were normalized to ubiquitin expression. values presented are the mean ± standard deviation  of n =  <dig> experiments. c western blot analysis of yap and phospho-yap  protein levels. equal loading was verified by gapdh expression . graph represents the quantification of western blot data. values presented are the mean ± sd of n =  <dig> controls vs. n =  <dig> lix1-expressing cell culture dishes. d graphs represent the quantification of ph3-positive cells. a minimum of  <dig> cells were analysed. values presented are the mean ± standard error of the mean . e rt-qpcr analysis of gene expression. values presented are the mean ± sd of six experiments.

our study first identified lix <dig> as a novel and thus far unique marker of stomach mesenchymal progenitors. to our knowledge, lix <dig> is the first described gene to define the population of mesenchymal progenitors and to allow discrimination between undetermined and determined smc states in the stomach. collectively, our in vivo gain- and loss-of-function experiments clearly demonstrate that lix <dig> is a key regulator of stomach mesenchyme development, by regulating both the determination and the differentiation of smcs. our study further demonstrates that yap <dig> is a key relay of the function of lix <dig> during these developmental processes.

we first identified lix <dig> as an essential regulator of stomach mesenchyme determination. we thus suspect that the expression of lix <dig> must be tightly regulated in the developing mesenchyme to allow fine-tuning of the transcript levels and the state of activation of the pro-proliferative transcriptional coactivator yap <dig>  which in turn controls the rates of proliferation required for correct smc determination. we further show that the fgf signalling pathway could be involved in the regulation of lix <dig> expression at determination stages. most studies published so far have identified some regulators of yap <dig> at the level of its activity, through its phosphorylation, localisation and stability  <cit> . our study identifies lix <dig> as a new regulator of yap <dig> mrna levels, which is a novel finding. this could result from a regulation of the transcription of yap <dig> mrna or from a regulation of its stability. expression data were not always statistically significant for tead <dig>  however, results were consistent between tead <dig> and tead across all experiments. we thus attribute the lack of significance in some cases of effects on tead <dig> to low statistical power rather than to absence of an effect. these functional in vivo data suggest that lix <dig> also regulates the expression of the tead transcription factors, which are essential in mediating yap-dependent gene expression  <cit> , indicating that lix <dig> is an upstream regulator of yap signalling. further investigations will allow us to understand by which mechanisms lix <dig> regulates the level of yap <dig> and tead transcripts. interestingly, in silico studies have shown that lix <dig> has a double-stranded rna-binding domain, suggesting that it could be involved in mrna or micro-rna processing  <cit>  and it has been shown that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> regulate yap <dig> expression  <cit> . it would thus be interesting to study whether lix <dig> has a direct impact on yap1/tead mrna expression and/or stability.

we then demonstrated that lix <dig> is an essential regulator of smc differentiation. intriguingly, while the pro-proliferative activity of lix <dig> presumably facilitates smc determination, lix <dig> has a negative impact on further smc differentiation. we suspect that high proliferative activity of lix <dig> led to cell contact inhibition of proliferation, revealing the presence of a negative feedback loop on the endogenous expression and activity of yap <dig> within the stomach mesenchyme to compensate for aberrant cell proliferation. accordingly, we never observed hypertrophic stomachs under lix <dig> influence, suggesting that lix <dig> pro-proliferation activity is limited by the overall size of the stomach. in response to high cell density, the hippo pathway regulates yap <dig> activity through inhibitory phosphorylation  <cit>  and we report here that the defect in smc differentiation is associated with an increase in inactive phosphorylated yap <dig> in lix1-misexpressing stomachs. while the hippo pathway has already been investigated in the context of gastrointestinal epithelia , our study is the first to suggest a role for this pathway in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of the gastrointestinal mesenchyme. along these lines, the next step would be to address the possible regulation of the hippo pathway by lix <dig> in this developmental process. lowfat, the arthropod homolog of lix <dig>  interacts with the atypical cadherins fat and dachsous and stabilizes fat protein levels  <cit> . although a recent study has shown that the vertebrate ortholog of fat does not seem to regulate the hippo pathway  <cit> , fat signalling has been shown to decrease yap <dig> activity  <cit> . one could thus speculate that, in the context of cell contact inhibition of proliferation, lix <dig> participates more directly in the inhibition of yap <dig> through the stabilization of fat levels. further investigations should focus on uncovering the potential molecular links that tie lix <dig> to the regulation of yap <dig> phosphorylation and transcriptional output.

similarly to our conclusions for lix <dig>  we also report that while the pro-proliferative activity of yap <dig> presumably facilitates smc determination, it is sensitive to cell contact inhibition of proliferation and has a negative impact on further smc differentiation. because our misexpression experiments only led to mild overexpression of yap <dig> , we speculate that the native stomach mesenchyme is poised to respond to mild over-activity of yap <dig> by turning on the negative feedback loop on yap <dig> activity. this finding contrasts with those of previous studies where high levels of yap <dig> overexpression led to sustained proliferation and overgrowth of undifferentiated cells  <cit> . in any case, the compensatory mechanisms resulting from lix <dig> or yap <dig> misexpression appeared to lock the determined mesenchyme in a state where the cells were neither proliferative nor differentiated. this state could simply reflect the requirement for a dynamic proliferation event between the determination and differentiation steps. by this hypothesis, because determined lix1/yap1-expressing cells are in contact inhibition of proliferation, differentiation could not be initiated. alternatively, we could speculate that a certain level of yap <dig> activity is necessary to initiate smc differentiation, and because yap <dig> activity has been turned off as a consequence of aberrant cell proliferation at the determination stage, differentiation could not be initiated. this second hypothesis highlights the possibility that yap <dig> plays a dual role in regulating stomach mesenchyme progenitor development, both during the proliferative phase and later on during the differentiation phase. this hypothesis concords with emerging data showing that yap <dig> regulates multiple signalling pathways, such as wnt, bmp and notch  <cit> , and that hippo signalling regulates notch signalling  <cit> . interestingly, all of these pathways are involved in the development of the gi tract . further investigations are required to examine how yap <dig> signalling is integrated in the regulation of smc differentiation. yap <dig> could be cooperating with two different transcription factors to regulate the processes of mesenchyme proliferation and smc differentiation, similarly to what has recently been described during self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium  <cit> . in that system, the authors showed that yap <dig> cooperates with klf <dig> in promoting differentiation of intestinal goblet cells. klf <dig> has been shown to abrogate the expression of myocardin, a major regulator of smc differentiation  <cit> , and of myocardin-induced expression of smc genes  <cit> , while yap <dig> has been shown to interact with myocardin and interfere with its activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our results demonstrate that lix <dig> is a novel and unique marker of digestive mesenchyme immaturity and a regulator of mesenchymal progenitor proliferation and differentiation through its capacity to regulate yap <dig> activity and density-dependent proliferation. additionally, we demonstrate that this activity of lix <dig> is conserved in cell culture, suggesting that the mechanism of lix <dig> action outlined here is not limited to the developing stomach mesenchyme. in light of these conclusions, it would be interesting to investigate whether the activity of lix <dig> is conserved throughout the more general context of organ size control and tissue regeneration. finally, we have highlighted, through a developmental approach, three properties of lix <dig> that could make it essential in cancer research. lix <dig> defines an immature state of stomach smooth muscle, regulates cell proliferation within this immature mesenchyme and regulates the activity of the oncogene yap <dig>  these three properties thus point to the interest of further studies to examine the possible function of lix <dig> in tumorigenesis and tumour progression.
